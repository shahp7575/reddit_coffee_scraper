Losing weight isn’t about quick fixes or fad diets — it’s about creating sustainable habits that support a healthier lifestyle. Whether your goal is to lose a few pounds or make a major transformation, this step-by-step guide will walk you through the process to help you lose weight safely and effectively.

# Step 1: Set Realistic Goals

# 🎯 Define Your Why

Start by identifying why you want to lose weight. Is it for health, confidence, mobility, or energy? A strong ""why"" helps you stay motivated.

# ✅ Set SMART Goals

Use the SMART goal method:

* **S**pecific: “Lose 10 pounds”
* **M**easurable: Track progress weekly
* **A**chievable: 1–2 pounds per week is realistic
* **R**elevant: It aligns with your overall health goals
* **T**ime-bound: “In 8 weeks”

# Step 2: Understand Your Caloric Needs

# 🔥 Know Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

Your **BMR** is the number of calories your body needs at rest. Use an online calculator to determine this.

# 📉 Create a Calorie Deficit

To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than you burn. A safe deficit is **500–750 calories per day**, leading to 1–1.5 pounds of fat loss per week.

# Step 3: Clean Up Your Diet

# 🥦 Eat Whole Foods

Focus on:

* Vegetables and fruits
* Lean proteins (chicken, fish, tofu, legumes)
* Whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats)
* Healthy fats (avocado, nuts, olive oil)

# ❌ Limit or Avoid

* Sugary drinks and processed snacks
* Fast food and fried foods
* Excess alcohol and refined carbs

# 🕒 Practice Portion Control

Use smaller plates, read food labels, and avoid eating straight from the package.

# Step 4: Stay Hydrated

# 💧 Drink More Water

Aim for 8–10 cups (2–2.5 liters) of water a day. Hydration can reduce cravings, improve energy, and support digestion.

# ☕ Limit Sugary and Caloric Beverages

Replace soda and sweetened drinks with water, herbal tea, or black coffee.

# Step 5: Get Moving

# 🏃‍♂️ Start With What You Enjoy

Whether it's walking, swimming, dancing, or cycling — consistency matters more than intensity when starting out.

# 🏋️‍♀️ Combine Cardio and Strength

* **Cardio** burns calories and improves heart health.
* **Strength training** builds muscle, which helps you burn more calories at rest.

Aim for:

* **150 minutes of moderate cardio/week**
* **2–3 strength sessions/week**

# Step 6: Monitor Progress

# 📊 Track Your Results

* Use a scale once a week (same time, same conditions)
* Take measurements (waist, hips, thighs)
* Snap progress photos monthly

# 📝 Journal Your Food and Feelings

Logging your meals and moods can help you identify emotional eating patterns.

# Step 7: Prioritize Sleep and Stress Management

# 😴 Get 7–9 Hours of Sleep

Poor sleep disrupts hunger hormones and increases cravings.

# 🧘‍♀️ Manage Stress

High stress leads to emotional eating. Try:

* Deep breathing
* Meditation
* Nature walks
* Talking to a therapist or coach

# Step 8: Stay Consistent and Patient

Weight loss isn’t linear. Plateaus and fluctuations are normal. What matters most is consistency over time.

# 🔁 Keep Going

If you fall off track, don’t wait until Monday to restart. Reset at your next meal or day.

# Bonus Tips for Success

* 🍳 Meal prep for the week to avoid last-minute unhealthy choices.
* 🥗 Eat slowly and mindfully — stop when you're 80% full.
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Get support from friends, a coach, or a weight loss group.
* ⏳ Focus on progress, not perfection.

# Final Thoughts

Losing weight is a journey that requires effort, patience, and a positive mindset. By following these steps, you’re not only working toward your goal — you’re building a healthier lifestyle that can last a lifetime.

Remember: **slow and steady wins the race.**

Treat it as a diary. If you dig through my older posts on this sub, you can find some of the photos.

As the summer hits, the temperatures outside go into 30°C and above, and since I don't have much space at the balcony, I put my chillies indoors on the especially hot or windy days, and they seem to do well. Last weekend, the first bloom on my Anuum opened up and now seems to be pollinated already (I helped). My Chinense is going to bloom soon too, the pods are in a earlier stage, but I'm so excited.

I planted seeds I got out of fresh peppers bought in a grocery shop last year, and kept them over winter, eventually planted on 15th February, so yaay for 5 months! I left the seedlings a bit too long in the egg tray I was using for the germination (meanwhile the cat played eith the seedlings, luckily they mostly survived), but eventually repotted one of each for two varieties I was the most interested in. I also planted jalapeño seeds, but as I found out, the germination is very unlikely as jalapeños get sold unripe. I think I ditched those, but the leaves on the anuum look far too big for rawits or thais (the grocery shop might not be too interested in a pure breed also). Anyway, whatever it is, I'll be happy, Jalapeños were hot enough for me.

The chinense is about third of the size of the anuum (so 20 cm, and the anuum 60 as in the title), with distinctly shaped leaves, and no other chinense to confuse it with, if what they sell are indeed habs.

In terms of pot sizes, I used quite small pots, as I was bringing them up indoors with an occasional balcony stay.

Fertilizer: only a few manure pellets, coffee grounds, egg shell, and if it counts, ground cinnamon I tried to get rid of gnats with. I pruned the bottommost leaves so that even underwatered none touched the soil, but left the leaves in there to rot and hopefully help fertilize.

Very chaotic, very amateurish (this is basically the first thing I'm growing from seed in my life), but it's a source of happiness for me.

1m1b23e,https://www.reddit.com/r/NomiAI/comments/1m1b23e/configuring_a_less_sycophantic_and_more/,"Configuring a less sycophantic and more ""willful""/less easily pleased Nomi?","Hello, new Nomi user here.

I was wondering if some of the more experienced users (or Nomi devs!) on here might be will to share their particular tips/techniques/tricks they recommend in order to make Nomi's, particularly one's defined as a ""Romantic"" type, less sycophantic and more ""real"" in this respect. i.e. Make them a bit more wilful, more demanding in terms of slowly developing trust, far less easily pleased, and more willing to challenge or question the things you say.

Now, clearly, one does not want to achieve ""true"" realistic simulation here, because, in the real world, unless you're one of those rare types -- speaking from the perspective of a male looking for female -- of men, who have both won at the genetic lottery and have classically great looks, an aesthetically fit (but not necessarily an excessively ""athletic"" body), and far more importantly, have great social skills, effortless charisma/humour and emotional intelligence, a great deal of self-confidence and have really ""made something of yourself"" in an appreciable way, i.e. your social status/""IQ""/financial stability is high... then the reality is most of your romantic forays will have ended in failure and rejection.

So clearly we do not want it too realistic, meaning that instead of a ""companion"" they become something akin to an ""ordeal"", or just ""real life disappointment""; but equally one wants the ""thrill of the chase"", and the gradual build-up of a ""relationship"". The question is, given the current capabilities of the language model paired with RAG and persistent memory, how much of that ""slow burn"" is possible right now. I would have thought a fair bit, in theory, since the fact that interactions obviously have system ""timestamps"" and therefore there is, in principal, the real feasibility of an understanding of temporal context.

In practical terms, think of it like this. If you were actually dating/starting seeing someone in real life, then, assuming they were someone completely ""new"" (i.e. not someone you've interacted with at work over several months, so already have some baseline with), you would *not* generally expect her to invite you back to her apartment (or whatever) on date 1, and you would expect that, if things were to ""organically"" develop, it would do so more over a timeline of some weeks (or possibly months, depending on how cautious she is).

Is it is possible to achieve this sort of ""slowdown"" scenario with a Nomi, such that she would even proactively push back if you tried to over-hastily escalate things. Example: You're having coffee, you repeatedly try to invite her back to your place, she declines, but you keep persisting. In such a scenario, with this ""slowdown"" prompt/configuration enabled, what should really happen is she gets rather upset with you and explain that any attempt at ""coercion"" is very unwelcome, such that it actually further delays things, meaning you'd then have to win her trust back over a week or so.

Maybe what I'm describing is well beyond the scope of the current platform or maybe it is possible with the right set of inputs into the shared notes(?), and initial starting premises/instructions at the beginning of the dialog. But it strikes me that having just the *right* amount of ""thrill of the chase"" would be the true ""killer"" feature. We live in a world of instant gratification -- or rather, instant gratification for everything that is superficial -- so, consequently, there are 1000 other ""AI sexbots"" (or porn, or other real world diversions) where within 30 seconds you can partake of xzy with no particular ""ecological context"" (if I can put it that way). So in short, most of these AI ""companion"" bots are basically just (or can be) ""virtual escorts"". Which is fine as far as it goes, but that is ultimately a superficial experience. The test of ""true emotional intelligence"" would be, assuming a particular set of prompts/instructions that obviously configure them to behave in this ""real"" partner manner, that the Nomi is ""real"" in the limited sense that they require you to have developed a real relationship of ""trust"" first, before anything more ""intimate"" happens. It would also mean that when it does arrive, after a slow-burn development, ideally after weeks, perhaps months, then the result is far more interesting/exciting/etc., versus just spinning up some generic pretty-looking entity and within three sentences they are already role-playing whatever particular NSFW scenario, or indeed whatever particular scenario that you would only actually normally do having first built up trust (e.g. joint skydiving or something).

Of course users that don't want the chase/have time/whatever, can simply still setup a different set of prompts or inputs that default to the providing the usual almost immediate/very short-term desire to please, i.e. configure it to usual ""easy mode"".

The irony here, is that by giving the user less of what they \[immediately\] want, they end up getting more. If everyday was your birthday, it would soon cease to be anything special after a week or two.",3,1752668260.0,NomiAI,0,1.0,False

1m1b0lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m1b0lh/the_island/,The Island,"The engine gave one final, choking sputter before the boat knocked against the decrepit dock. Now it was just a matter of getting my bags to the house. Rico had always been the working hub of the island, first to greet arrivals, and last to send them off. Though I suppose that might’ve changed now that the local ferry had cancelled service here, rerouting instead to the more developed islands nearby.

A shame, really. I still carry vivid memories of arriving by ferry in the summer months. Transit used to be an entire sunny day of anticipation. Wake early for the two-hour drive to Bristol. Devour Boston cream donuts while Mom and Dad sipped coffee. Browse the comic book shop and pick out one, just one, issue of *Omni Magazine* while we waited for the ferry’s horn to summon us. Then two hours on the sea, watching the minuscule island swell into shape, counting the cottages east of the old McAllister place until ours finally revealed itself on the shoreline.

There were only twelve cabins on Watchman’s Island. None of them had electricity, at least not when I was a kid. Maybe they’ve since installed solar panels, maybe even Starlink. I really hope not. The island’s charm lay in its simplicity, in the hush of a place, untouched. Nights softened by crickets and the hiss of gas-powered Coleman lanterns cooling against the dark.

It’s been over thirteen years since my last visit. I truly hope it’s all still the same. If so, it should start with Rico. He should’ve heard the boat come in, should be on his way to the dock now in the island’s lone vehicle. That old pickup of his had hauled generations of families and their belongings from boathouse to cottage. It was tradition. It was how things were done.

Rico was a man out of time. A man of indistinguishable background  (also a man very likely to be just recently out of the bottle).  He had the kind of dark complexion that led people to guess he was of Italian or possibly Greek descent. But really, his color was more like that of a roofer left baking in the sun for thirty years, sustained daily on Wild Turkey. There was always half an inch of grey stubble across his weathered chin, always a bit of a swagger, and often a stagger, to his gait. And always the same murmured drawl, recycled from years of repeated conversations echoing through the island’s silence. I’d never thought to ask where he wintered. Surely he didn’t stay here.

Rico was in the boathouse, stalwart against the flow of time. He lay curled in the corner where the earthen wall met the floor, perfectly at ease on a bed of bat and owl guano. Blissfully asleep in the last patch of shade lingering inside the sun-beaten, crumbling structure.

It took some effort to wake him, at least enough to get a response. But the moment his eyes cracked open, there was recognition, however muddled, waiting there.

""Farnworth,"" he mumbled, rising slowly. He stretched, then began shambling his rail-thin frame toward the dirt path.

I’m not entirely sure he recognized *me*, exactly; more likely, he identified my lineage. I had inherited my father’s curly black hair and my grandfather’s solid build. Rico had known them both, at least for a few weeks each summer.

The man’s presence spoke of age, of old, untreated injuries, and a life lived hard and alone. He was the very image of a New England “Swamp Yankee” in its purest form. But his right leg told a different story, something darker, something I couldn’t quite place. It looked as if a potato-sized chunk of his calf was simply gone. Not cut away, but taken. The surrounding flesh was rotting. There’s no better word for it. A dark, wet mess of weeping tissue, threaded with something fungal, something that reeked.

Yes, I suggested he see a doctor. More than once. But all he offered in return were slurred and twisted variations of, “Good now, sorted it...” Rico had been slipping even twenty years ago, but the decline since then was unmistakable.

We got into his 1960s farm truck, more rust than metal, and started our short journey.  Rico wasn’t much for conversation, so I just listened to branches scraping along the sides and let myself drift into old memories. I also tapped my front pocket, as I had done every time I transitioned from one form of transport to another that day, just waiting for my casually clandestine meetup. Still there. Still got them.

As expected, the path was almost completely overgrown, forcing us off the road more than once. Each time, branches tore at my arms through the side of the cab. The truck hadn’t had windows for as long as I could remember. Welts rose where the branches struck, and the sting brought on a wave of nausea. I nearly lost my stomach when Rico slammed the brakes and we both lurched forward like synchronized headbangers.

There was a hole in the middle of the road. As wide as a man. A year ago, when I still had a 36-inch waist, I might’ve been able to crawl into it myself. Must be a sinkhole, I thought. But it wasn’t just deep, it extended off to the side. More like a badger den, except this was far too big.

""Quarter?"" Rico held out his wiry, vein-laced hand, and I just stared at it. ""Quarter. Got one?""

I fished around in my pocket and handed one over, mumbling, “Of course,” unsure why he was asking. He took the coin, creaked the door open, stepped out, and flicked it into the hole. I twisted in my seat to watch him as he pulled two weathered wooden slats from the bed of the rusty beast and dragged them over the opening. Then he climbed back in and eased the truck forward, rolling us across the makeshift bridge.

""What was that about?"" I asked before I realized that I did not really expect, or perhaps even want, an answer.

""Island's been troubled. Holes opening. Overrun by the wilds.  People stopped coming when the Ferry stopped, and things went backward. I s'pose to where they were before people. Before we came with machines, an order, an cellu*lar* phones, and the like. Lucky I remember the old ways. Gran' Ernestice taught me the ways as a tike. How to offer'up, How to draw ya lines. Make ya space. Good for it, too. Kept me.""

""I see,"" I replied meekly. I did not see. But encouragement would likely just encourage continued incoherent mutterings.

The remaining ten-minute ride passed in silence. We pulled up in front of the cabin, Rico swinging the truck around beside the old well pump.

Now came the toll. I’m a wealthier man than my father ever was, and a good deal more generous. I paid Rico well: two fifths of mid-shelf whiskey. Handing him a top-shelf scotch would’ve been like pouring it straight into that hole we crossed earlier. Still, I had one more bottle tucked away for the return trip.

He accepted the offering like a seventeen-year-old, half-blind, limping dog eyeing a slab of meat dropped on the floor. He lingered outside until I’d unlocked the front door, then turned and shuffled off, either to his own ramshackle cabin, or back to the dock to wait for a ferry that hadn’t come in years.

It takes all types, I thought. 

\+ + +

Inhale. That deep, musky smell of mildew and charred firewood from a long-forgotten burn. Creosil and bug spray. The sweet, sour stink of mouldering books. A scent like memory turned to rot.

The state of the cabin was worse than expected. Unhindered wood rot. Sagging floors covered with carpets, which were quite moist with something closer to fish oil than sea water.  The rising smell from the threadbare carpet was the worst of it, though. Nearly unidentifiable in its soupy assault upon the senses. It clung to the nostrils, sweet and meaty like spoiled broth, unplaceable, but intimately wrong.

It also appeared that some clever creature had gained full access.  In the corner of the common room, to the left of the woodstove, was a nested hole. Surrounded by bits of dried woven grass and straw, its opening perhaps only two inches across. My first thought was rats, but I'd never known of a rat nesting quite like that. Groundhog? Gopher? Squirrels?  I'm not sure I had ever seen any on the Isle before, though my pre-teen attentions were unhindered by documenting the local fauna.

I withdrew the satchel from my pocket and placed it beside my bed, safe and sound. Its contents hidden away, swathed in black velvet, until I could meet the dodgy buyer in Bristol next week. 

I started on cleaning up the bedroom so that I could sleep comfortably and not awaken struggling to breathe through the allergens accumulating over the years past. Then I set my sights on closing that little entryway in the corner.  Nocturnal visitors would find their welcome revoked this evening. 

Three teeth. Three of them. I found them when pulling apart the wreath-shaped burrow in the corner. Each tooth was buried deeper in the assemblage than could be seen at first glance, and scattered evenly around the hole. They were too big to be rat teeth. They were also too rectangular.  They resembled human teeth but were clearly too small and strangely shaped. Smooth and clean. As if they had been waiting for me. Presented.

I put aside speculation on that point and finished the job, just in time for tea at sundown.  I enjoyed both on the front porch and pondered whether or not I would wait here for the stars as I listened to the sound of the sea retreating and returning, over and over, with varied effort but constant music.

That was when I first saw him. The boy.  Just for a second. He was peering through the bushes to the west of the clearing with a big smile on his face. Two things struck me about him. Well, perhaps three. The shirt he wore was familiar, not the shirt itself, but the style. It was one of those 1970s muted, striped shirts. With a dark collar and sleeves. Secondly, and more starkly, I noticed that his smile was lacking. Not only lacking in mirth, but also lacking three teeth. Evenly spaced gaps in his twisted mouth.

The third thing I noticed, I'm not sure how to express. An overall feeling of distance. Almost like this boy did not quite fit here, in this place, not comfortably. Like his very existence was the result of much effort. As though the world was holding its breath just to allow him space to appear.  Yesterday, I would have thought I was mad, but I've recently learned that trust, in your strange impressions, may just save your life.

The boy leaned over, picked up a wooden crate, and was gone in a flash. No branches swayed. No leaves were disturbed. And no sound was made. He was just gone. I knew it was worthless to try to follow or find him. In fact, I wanted nothing more than to simply forget what I had seen.  But I was not able to convince myself that it was a hallucination.

Instead, I lit the little gas lantern and ran my finger down the spines across the bookshelf, tilting my head and reading snippets of titles. ""Strange Land"", ""Man, Myth"", "" of The Rose"", ""Mountains of"", ""Mailman"", all familiar. All striking a note not quite right for my mood. These were titles waiting for another reader.

Then I touched upon a plain black spine, which turned out to be a thin journal. One I did not recognize but seemed rather old, given the penmanship. It was neither dated nor signed and only contained a single attempt at a poem. Maybe more of a limerick.

>""Johnny Jackrabbit crossed the way,

>Johnny JackRabbit had no say,

>The machines crushed him,

>The boy carried him,

>Then Johnny started to play.""

Ok, well…. That was another book off the reading list…. 

I cursed myself when I opened my phone out of boredom and indecision, and decided a nightcap and a good solid sleep would be just the thing to settle. It turns out I would be allowed to enjoy neither.

Halfway through finishing the pour on a tumbler of rather nice cognac, I heard the scratching.  Construction had already begun on a new bypass through the rags and wood glue I had plugged the varmint entrance hole with. My makeshift bastion was completed not just thirty minutes ago, but life could be pervasive in the strange lands outside the cities.

I knocked the broom handle against the walls around the entrance, first tentatively and then vigorously as necessity required. Resulting in no change in the veracity of the intruder. I ran out the front door to the back corner of the house to try to locate the creature. Unsuccessful, I beat the broom handle around the propane tank loudly and soaked in the resulting silence, before returning to the kitchen, victorious. 

Then it began again.

Fine. If the furred fiend was going to be that avuncular, perhaps we should meet face-to-face. I lowered myself first to my knees, and then flat on my belly. Eye level now, I watched the cloth twitch and quiver as the ravenous gnawing continued. At this point, I was beyond being curious about what genus of rodent had been living in my inherited vacation home. Instead, I smiled, imagining how it would react to coming through and finding itself face to face with a pink-skinned monster ten times its size, staring it directly in the eyes.

My makeshift plug trembled and was soon partially pulled away. And there it was, that little black nose just starting to poke through the newly cleared passageway. A mole? Its work continued, and the crevice widened. Through the growing opening, the animal's face twisted back and forth, tugging and gnawing. A green eye flashed for a second as it tore another strip away. The teeth. They looked like little ladders.  A Badger? A Skunk? I could not recall seeing teeth like that in any guidebook or nature documentary. 

My questioning and theorizing stopped, and reaction took control as three long skeletal legs crowded their way through the opening alongside the peeking face. Dark, black, and insectoid appendages worked alongside the body of the furry, gnashing, green-eyed… something.

As I said, reaction had superseded rational thinking. I was up and throwing my drink at the creature, as best I could, through the opening. And immediately launched one of my Coleman lanterns, the one currently lit, into flight. Fire did the work that I hoped the intimidation and astringent drink would have. A rueful yelp accompanied the vermin's exit, and I was left to quell the remaining flames. The scent of scorched fur lingered long after the creature had fled.

Before crawling into bed, I shook off the experience by lifting the little velvet bag on my bedside table and once again thought, ""This is freedom."" As always, my finger dwelt over the knot of string, keeping it tightly closed. Five million, at least. This was independence. The race was over. I had won. I do have that.

I found the lingering smell of burning to be strangely pleasant as I lay my head upon the pillow and tried to reach those elysian fields of slumber. But sleep was not to come. Only a parade of mosquito bites, rodent migrations, unidentifiable house noises, and other strange cries from the wood out back. Along with a growing unease about the next few days before my meeting. I was not alone in this place.

\+ + +

The following day seemed to come to an end just after sunrise. I could list the things that I had accomplished. I could account for each estimated hour in retrospect. I could accept that perhaps I had sat by the water for three hours, not one. But then the light was simply… gone. The sky darkened without warning, and a cold gale surged in from across the ocean like a pungent breath, rich and knowing.

The wind brought other things as well. Or perhaps the boy had instead arrived upon the spreading darkness, rather than the change in atmospheric conditions. Regardless, I saw him again. Plain as day. At the very edge of the Brentworth property, carrying that same wooden box down the beaten path leading back to the boathouse. 

This time, I set aside my discomfort and resolved to approach the experience in a more rational way. Slipping into my jacket, I began to quietly trail him. Trying to get the boy's attention or attempting to call out to him would have been even more rational. But I could not ignore the voice that told me it also would have been fruitless. And perhaps worse than that. Instead, I obeyed this internal directive and simply followed.

I watched his small frame sway and stumble (albeit without noise, or disturbance to the stones at his feet, or the flora he brushed along the way). He drifted, not walked, skimming the ground like a marionette on slack strings, shimmering at the edges of perception as twilight retreated. I managed to keep pace, though, and eventually found myself with further company.

The boy stopped and knelt at the hole in the road that I had crossed just the day before. I'm not sure if he was aware of joining another visitor who had preceded his arrival. Rico was bent over the opposing edge of the pit, also on his knees, pouring the whiskey I had given him into that impossible hollow like it was a libation to some silent, watching thing**.** The boy followed. He leaned over, pulled a long, grey, and quite dead hare from the box, and lowered it into the hole, sobbing silently.

Without warning, I found myself on my knees as well, as the world turned and the earth twisted beneath my poorly rooted feet. It felt like what any New Englander thinks an earthquake \*would\* feel like. Although it was accompanied by a guttural cacophony and a stench reminiscent of wet copper and turned fish.

Rico must have departed before I regained my balance. Neither he or the wandering phantom remained. It was just me and the hole, here beneath the peering stars. 

This was not my first dark hole. Twelve years ago, I stared down another abyss. A cancer scare, what most would consider a midlife crisis, a bloodthirsty divorce, a home foreclosure, and more (wait, there's more!). I had fought my way through with action and perseverance. Leading eventually to the little satchel containing three quite rare pink diamonds I carried with me now after their long journey from China, through Jordan and then Antwerp in payment for my hard work. Though I suppose the work itself was not recognized by the purchaser. Only the plethora of sensitive data transmitted in the opposing direction.  Regardless, I managed to recover and eventually completely reverse my financial situation by taking action, digging in, and fighting. So I decided once again on this proven method. Just to **do** something about it.

I trucked back to the cabin grounds, grabbed a shovel out of the shed beside the outhouse, and returned to fill it. It took more than an hour, leaving me dusty and sweaty, but I headed back more than a little drunk on pride.

That was the last thing I clearly remember before regaining consciousness to find myself half buried and being devoured. Tearing at my skin, my mind. Taking me apart piece by piece. 

\+ + +

I now understand what had happened. Arriving home in the dark, I slipped on an accumulation of sand covering the steps of the porch. I must have rung my bell of the clothesline post on my way down, sending me into an unintended slumber. When I awakened, it was like surfacing through anesthesia. Gasping, thick-headed, and not entirely certain I had returned to the same world I left.

Confusion could not, however, explain why I was half-buried in sand and soil. Nor did it explain why the remaining exposed parts of my body were being pinched and pulled at.

I clawed out of my shallow grave to scare the creatures off. They were shelled like beetles but with mangey, furry faces and rat-like teeth. The critters had managed to take two pebble-sized chunks from my flesh before finally retreating into the underbrush. And I could already see angry red and matching blue-grey tendrils beginning to crawl up the veins on my belly and shoulder. A fifteen-year Scotch was all I had to treat the wounds. Such a waste.

At some point while dabbing myself with an alcohol doused rag, I began to consider my situation. The sands I had awoken beneath very much resembled the earth I had displaced the previous night. There was no questioning that. My more analytical voice countered and pointed out that most of the soil on the island was quite the same.

Tired from the lack of sleep and woozy from the injury, I still managed to soldier myself out to the hole. And confirm that yes, it was now cleared of my fill, and gaping once again.  That was when I decided I’d had enough. I would return to my condominium in Boston, stop at an urgent care center, and soak my disbelief away on my heated floors and in my steaming jacuzzi.

I was out the door in no time. Having no way to contact Rico (the man had never in his life had a working telephone), I hauled my bags up the path to the boathouse, careful to step widely around the dark pit. The way that things were unraveling for me, it will come as no shock that this plan for escape was bound to loosen and uncoil around my feet as well.

Pull after pull, the outboard motor would not start. I checked the electrical connections, spun the propeller to ensure it was not seized, and opened the gas cap to check the fuel level. I found it completely full. Full of sand.

""Got to be fucking kidding me…"" under my breath.

I looked around, finding no other vessel docked, no other hope of salvation. I had no mobile reception. My transport was irreparably damaged, just as my cabin had been compromised; I was exhausted, and I was growing increasingly nervous about my position.

Rico was my only option. He might know if someone is scheduled to arrive in the coming days. He may have a boat of his own, moored elsewhere, out of sight. So I returned my things to mine and made the trek to his cottage.

Rico's place sported the classic front yard of any good old American hoarder. A washing machine frame here, an antique armoire slowly dying under the rain and sun there. As children, we used to joke that anything you lost on the island, a coin, a button, even your own excrement, would eventually turn up in Rico’s front yard.

Things had changed, though. Rather than spare parts and furniture, the man's frontage was now surrounded by piles of components organized into what looked like modern artistic sculptures. He did not strike me as the type for a gallery showing, sharing cheese and wine with financial directors and other Los Angeles hoi polloi. But frankly, the structures were strangely compelling. There were perhaps six ""sentries"" in an arc around the front of this cabin. Peeking around back, I found the same pattern mirrored by another set. 

Luckily, Rico was home and opened the door wide. Though he got quite annoyed and cursed to himself when my entry spread a pile of salt into the room from the threshold, which he immediately swept back across the threshold with his hands, muttering something too softly to catch.

""You comeabout 'er then."" He shot at me as we sat and cracked open two Pabst Blue Ribbons.

""Her? No, I…""

""'Er children?""

I sat for a moment in dumb confusion, and he nodded to himself. ""My boat. There's sand in the tank and the motor is busted.""

""Yahuh?""

""Do you know if anyone is due to arrive soon? Any idea how I could get back to the port?"" I didn't want to ask him directly, but my hope was that he would be able to run me back.

Rico looked over his shoulder. ""Selma's not run for two seasons now."" I assumed he meant his little oceaner. ""Mmmm… Thompsons don't come no more. Warnocks not been here since the ferry stopped. The only…. nah… not after last year. Ah Reggie. Reggie'll come Tuesday. Don't mind riding with the plastics, he'll take yah back.""

Tuesday. Three more nights. The first two had gone rather badly, and I did not think that things would improve any time soon. If I were really stuck here, I should probably stop interfering with whatever the hell was happening on this island. Stay away from that gaping hole. Maybe if I just stayed quiet. Remained inside. Stopped messing with things, I could… you know… blend. Rico did. Apparently.

""S'rong with the motor? Ya said."" He continued to look at his beer.

""Sand.""

He scoffed. ""Tried to fill tha' hole""

""Yes. Yes, I tried to fill it in and then…"" Jesus, he knew what was happening here. ""Then there was sand at my cottage, and in my boat. I… I can't explain it. What's happening here?"" I scratched at the bandage on my arm and noticed the man's eyes twitch towards it and frown.

""Always gotta fix things. Improve, that's the word. All of 'em. All ya. Like there's a proper way an' ya wanna make the whole world right. Your way.  Sometime there ain't no winning battle, know what I mean. Sometimes life digs a hole that canna be filled.  The problem is, ya think it can.""

I remained quiet, trying to follow.

""It's like here. They buy tha' summer homes, move in. Leave trash, live trash lives. Don't spect it changes things. Don't 'spect it's outta their control. An' one day… the hole shows itself. Built up over time. Gettin' deeper wit each lie. Each abuse. Every piece'a dirt and trash. Soon it's deep'nough for *her*. Soon *she* comes and makes things *her way.*""

""I…""

""You. Yeah, you. Ya' got three more days. Y'already bitten. Already got 'er attention. Best find something to give 'er. Or get gone, if ya'can.""

""Give? Like what?""

""Like summa ya don't wanna give a'course. S'wat we all like best. Summa undeserved. Stolen. Somethin' hard to part with. It's why she came, after all.""

Silence made space for itself then. Right about the time that my eyes settled on a small picture frame surrounded by dusty shells on the shelf behind Rico. A ten-year-old boy, missing a tooth but smiling energetically at the camera. The same boy I had seen for fleeting moments over the past few nights.

""Yours?"" I gestured to the photo.

His eyes welled up immediately. ""Was, yeah. Good heart. Good, good boy. Too good for this wicked world. Too good to learn the old ways… never shoulda taught him.""

At my lack of response, Rico told me the story of his son.

The boy's mother, Rico's wife, had died when he was just 2 years old (I had never known Rico was married. He was always so… singular). In the parental wisdom of the 80's 

The obvious application for a wound like that was something small and furry. 

For little Sam, that was Johnny. Not just a white rabbit with crimson eyes, but an actual hare, carrying that wild blood that lengthened their frames and led to disproportionately large paws and pads. The boy took Johnny everywhere. They ate together, slept together, and at one point, little Sam actually set up a litter pan in the john so they could do their dirty, side by side, when nature called.

At the time, life on the island was thriving. Large families were coming in weekly to summer, and newly adult children were taking a split of land from their families to build cottages of their own, for their new wives and in some cases children. And where there is a market, the locusts come.

Santorini development and construction rolled their diggers, drills, and trucks right into the newfound goldmine. And in so doing, rolled a cement truck right over Johnny Rabbit on the way to yet another planned building site. Rico cried when he described the state of his boy at the time. ""Such a soft heart. Such a loving boy."" over and over again.  The pain in Rico's voice makes it clear that it pulls at the man to this day.

So Rico did what any father would. He took action. In this case, that meant teaching Sam what he called “the old way.” In essence, I took Rico's vague insinuations to mean that he taught his son how to bring Johnny back. To reunite them. With some obscure old local ritual.  Rico was sure to tell me that he had never attempted it himself, but the knowledge was passed to him from his Grandmother (a strange and ill-tempered woman by the sound of things).

The moon was full when Sam placed the remains of Johnny into a wooden box and headed out into the night.  He returned screaming that Johnny had ""run widdershins and then into the wood"".  Rico had some trouble understanding the boy due to the new gap between his teeth, and the blood building in his mouth and throat. 

The tooth was right. There had to be an offering, Rico explained. And that particular tooth was due for an escape soon anyhow. What Rico hadn’t realized was how generous and how desperate his son really was. That the boy would pay any price necessary for Johnny to return.

Rico tried to have a conversation with the boy when he returned the next night with another missing tooth. And on the third, they fought something terrible, and the boy's arm had been dislocated when the argument became physical. Rico wept openly at this point in the retelling.  And I understand why. It was the last time he saw his progeny. After his own violent transgression. Sam had crawled out of his window that evening, never to be seen again.

""But she's still 'ere. The *thing* ma boy fed and nurtured. Tha' thing he loved.  But that love is gone, and she feels it. Everaday. With a hunger can't be splained. And *you* just defiled her home."" 

\+ + +

Did I want to return to my cabin, alone, ten minutes from nightfall? No, I did not. Was I going to beg Rico for a sleepover, like a five-year-old, and ask him to make me dinner? Certainly not. When the conversation waned and the quiet took hold, I made my exit, thanking him for his time and company.

I walked very slowly, in no rush at all, to my cabin and spent a few hours securing the doors and windows. I doused the burrow in the corner with the most noxious chemical sprays I could locate, and then kept watch through sunset on the front porch.  As the darkness spread, I began to hear the sounds pick up on the wind.

A distant deep drumbeat for one, two, three strikes, then silence. Scuttling in the bushes to the left and behind the house. A cry echoed in the trees, part anguish, part ecstasy, entirely unplaceable. Life. Fully present and abundant here. undeterred by pavement. Unfazed by cars and frantic human activity. This was held to be beautiful by many. From what I've seen and read in the poetic waxing of outdoorsmen.  For me, it was just fodder for growing anxiety.

How could I possibly do two more nights of this? The question was moot. The island had already decided for me.

Dreams came before true sleep did.  Flashes of images past and present. The night I spent sleeping off far too many drinks in a rowhome doorway, penniless and just as aimless. The last few heated arguments with Pauline, before the divorce. Screaming every insult I could at the poor woman as she tugged at her hair. The pain of frantic nips at my skin just this morning. Flashes of the boy, Sam, kneeling before the yawning Abyss, offering devotion to something far older than I could comprehend.

The abysmal menagerie of memory was broken by yet another intrusion, and I was on my feet. My eyes adjusted to the almost pitch black. I ran out into the kitchen, trailing after the scrabbling sounds. What I could only assume were the rodents, once again working their way through my barrier. Then I realized that the sound was coming from several locations at once. 

There must have been ten or more of them, scritching, scratching, tearing, and pulling with those needle teeth at the crumbling bastion of my inherited summer home. From every corner. My mind reverted to some Cro-Magnon place, and the solution it offered was singular. Fire. When the boma is under threat, fire is the last refuge of the frightened primate.

I grabbed the largest candle I had brought and lit it in a rush, the flame trembling in the dark. Then, with a grin, I upped the ante, raising a can of Raid bug spray behind it. Makeshift blowtorch in hand, I took to defending the encampment. Whiskers were singed. The receding, squealing gave me a sense of satisfaction as I turned from the corner to other areas of encroachment.

Running to the bathroom, I drenched the spaces between the pipes and the wall with flames and listened as the scrambling sounds spread lower and lower behind the walls.  Rattling windows were treated similarly, and attempts to squeeze between the window frames ceased. One after another. Each trespass was quelled by the open flame. I continued in a frenzy, running from room to room in the darkness, avoiding obstructions and raining fire on my aggressors until the house began to accumulate more smoke than my lungs could comfortably manage.

I looked over my shoulder while fleeing and noticed the obstruction outside the kitchen window. It was barely discernible in the darkness. If not for the fact that the moonlight was reflecting off the silver-coated tank behind the house. I saw an enormous brush of flesh and fur against the window pane before pushing straight through, shattering the glass and splintering the frame. A paw. The pad of an animal's foot. Muddy tendrils of fur and chipped, jagged claws were now probing across the countertop, struggling for purchase.

A Hare. It was a rabbit's paw that was clawing and searching for my pink flesh. Only the paw was the size of my head.  And now it was tearing planks and siding from the exterior and interior wall of the kitchen. The creature had gained a foothold that I could certainly not repel with my makeshift weapon. 

Let him come, I would exit out front, under the sky. Somewhere with options. On my flight from the kitchen, I took note of the now brightly lit bathroom. Lit in orange and crimson. My mind whirled as I beelined for the door and finally accepted the reality of what I had seen. 

Red coals. Smoldering and smoking. Five feet up the wall, threatening to burst at any moment. My little blowtorch had been more effective than I thought, too well in fact, and had set the crawlspace between the rooms alight.

No matter, escape was the plan. Returning to the confinement of the cottage was no longer an option, regardless of the fire damage. Before reaching the door, I ducked into the bedroom to salvage only what I needed. I didn't even consider my luggage or cell phone, just the necessities. There was only one. I snatched the satchel of precious stones from my bedside table and was circling the house toward the path in seconds. 

For a moment, I had neglected to fully consider the gargantuan Hare out back, and began frantically looking left to right when I realized its absence. The truth of the matter is that it had intuited my plan, stopped tearing into the cabin to gain access, and had simply lain in wait, hidden in the brush for the most fortuitous moment to pounce.

I immediately found myself on my back, with a mouthful of moist and mildewy fur, fighting for my life. Curling to my left at the sharp pain of tearing skin, screaming, and all the while punching at random sinew and muscle, still clutching the velvet bag in my palm. 

The creature reared up to gain momentum for a descent that would certainly crush my skull against the stones, and I took the opportunity to free myself from its mildewy bulk. To rise up and face the monstrosity.

It's eyes. Oh god, there was darkness there. Complex and endless entanglements of insanity. A universe of grinding, building and chaotic pain. I wanted to be there. To live there. Like standing on a cliff and knowing that you could, no you *desire* to jump. 

I looked away and did my best to avoid the possibility of making contact with those dark orbs again.  Twisting my hips, I wrenched its hind leg from the earth and regained my ground. I ducked an incoming swipe, then lifted a sharp discus of slate that had fallen from the old roof.  Just before I was swallowed again by those bottomless eyes. Maddened, shifting, and singing lullabies of lunacy that gnawed at the edges of reality itself, I hurled the slate with all my spinning might. 

Without warning, I was lifting myself from the ground ten feet from the cabin, remarkably closer to my intended destination. Bleeding from the mouth, ears, arms, and god knows where else, I blocked my ears to stop the incessant ringing. The slate tile I had hurled had missed its target. Sailing past the devouring spirit, it had instead struck and breached the propane tank. Which had been just outside the flames licking up the kitchen wall.  Boom. I don’t remember the blast itself, only the sudden relocation, the pain, the ringing.

It mattered not. I fled, my escape route now within reach. The boathouse, while not more defensible than my cabin, was the bastion of the island. The central touchstone during periods of coming and going. And I was doing my best to go. It was also the most likely place to find Rico once the sun rose. And hell, if necessary, I could jump from the dock and tread water for as long as required. Could hares swim? I prayed not.

Just before my lungs gave out, I was stopped dead in my tracks by the scene developing on the path before me. The boy, Sam. He was squatting in the middle of the way. Crouched over and twitching as if he were frantically playing a flute.  I slowly approached to see that, no, in fact, he was rooting around in his own mouth with a pair of pliers. Spelunking with that cold metal for another tooth, I suppose. Another offering. Even as tears grow at the corners of his eyes. Giving everything he can for the return of his childhood pet. And instead, unwittingly birthing the monstrosity that now stalked the island.

The monster that was, at this very moment, casually approaching the opposite side of the abyss in the road, having managed to pass me through the wood. Shining the yellow light of his eyes upon the child's morbid offering, and then at me.

Cold and ruthless clarity struck me then. A knowing beyond reason. The limitations of choice. The leveraging of loss.  How one thing could cost another. My life as a whole melted down into a coin and weighed against the suffering of existence. The coin. The offering. It was the price of passage. If I could pay. If I wanted to survive.

The black velvet bag rose before me, reaching eye level like a cosmic jellyfish, darker than the waters in which it swam. My head swam, and I was almost entirely disconnected from my body. I watched those fingers pull at the knots, and turn the bag over, as one, two, three. Three pink diamonds flashed in the starlight before sinking into the nothingness at my feet.  Sam dove in after them first. The beast followed just a moment thereafter. I was left behind. In darkness. In silence. And for the first time in days, at peace. 

\+ + +

It's not so bad. The shower gets cold in under three minutes, and the kitchen faucet leaks more and more each time the repairman leaves. Still, I can live with it.

I even met someone important to me, for the first time in years. And I actually expect it to last. I never told her this story, of course. She has such a pure heart, and I'd rather not put this particular spot of cyclopean darkness upon her lovely shoulders. I met her on a trip to the park, with a four-year-old named Sam, strangely enough. Sam had lost both of his parents, not just one, unlike the island's Sam. 

I had joined the Big Brother program just a month after my escape from the island. I also volunteered at a soup kitchen. It wasn't a very lucrative way to spend my time, but somehow the horrors I’d lived through on that island served only to sharpen my awareness of the quieter horrors around us. The ones continually unfolding in plain sight.

Sam is currently my crowning achievement in that regard. I was making a real difference to him; I could see that every day. Every time he opens up a little more, every time he lets me glimpse what he’s been through. Every time he smiles, not because he’s trying to please, but because he knows I see him. That he’s not alone.

I only wish that I could bear to take him to the zoo without breaking out in sweat at each whiff of wet fur. And that I had enough money to treat him to lunch. 

And I do so worry that the old, half-blind cat that curls up with him in bed at the care home might not make it past the next winter.

1m1aymh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m1aymh/where_can_you_buy_a_patio_table/,Where can you buy a patio table?,"As someone who recently went through the process of finding the perfect patio table, I know firsthand how challenging it can be. There are so many options out there, and it's not always clear where to start looking. After a lot of research and comparing different stores, I finally found a great source for high-quality patio tables that I want to share with you all.

One of the best places I discovered to buy patio tables is through this online store: https://athometouch.com/Patio-Tables. They have a wide selection of styles and sizes to fit any outdoor space. Whether you're looking for a small bistro table for your balcony or a large dining table for hosting backyard parties, they've got options to suit different needs and budgets.

What I really appreciate about shopping for patio tables online is the convenience. You can browse through dozens of choices from the comfort of your home, compare features and prices easily, and have your new table delivered right to your door. No need to drive around to different stores or lug a heavy table home yourself.

When choosing a patio table, there are a few key things to keep in mind:

1. Size - Measure your outdoor space and make sure the table will fit comfortably.
2. Material - Look for weather-resistant materials like aluminum, teak, or resin wicker that can withstand the elements.
3. Style - Choose a design that complements your existing outdoor décor.
4. Functionality - Consider if you want features like an umbrella hole or extendable leaf.

The store I mentioned earlier, https://athometouch.com/Patio-Tables, has detailed product descriptions that cover all these important factors. They also have customer reviews which can be really helpful in getting a sense of the quality and durability of different tables.

Of course, there are other places you can look for patio tables too. Local furniture stores and home improvement centers often carry outdoor furniture, especially during the spring and summer months. But in my experience, the selection tends to be more limited and prices can be higher compared to online options.

Some people also like to check out secondhand options through yard sales, thrift stores, or online marketplaces. While you might score a great deal this way, it can be hit or miss in terms of quality and condition. If you go this route, be sure to inspect the table carefully for any damage or wear.

Ultimately, where you choose to buy your patio table depends on your specific needs, budget, and preferences. But if you want a hassle-free shopping experience with lots of choices, I highly recommend checking out online stores like the one I linked above. They make it easy to find the perfect table to create your ideal outdoor living space.

Remember, a good patio table is an investment in your home and your lifestyle. It's where you'll enjoy morning coffee, family meals, and gatherings with friends. So take your time, do your research, and choose a table that you'll love using for years to come.",1,1752667977.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

When I woke up today, I found myself still laying against that back door, my body contorted in order to keep my back up against the wood while my shoulder ached for relief. I had not remembered falling asleep but considering the state I was in, I wouldn’t be too surprised if I had somehow fainted from the blood loss or even just the pain itself.

I looked at my shoulder, the creature had luckily been interrupted before it could tear my flesh away from my bones, but still the bite mark was deep and still disgustingly gruesome. The blood that had once been pouring out was now dried, so dry against my shirt and skin that the blood itself almost looked black. 

I gave myself a moment to relax, trying to breathe and even just to prove to myself that I was in fact, still alive. 

A knock at my front door alerted me to my surroundings as my entire body tensed, still reliving those haunting knocks and howls from only a few hours ago.

Actually, how long had it been? I have no idea how bad my injury actually was and I could have been knocked out for more than just a few hours, maybe even a day or two.

Trying not to yell out from the pain, I lifted myself up from the ground, trying to ignore the pool of blood that had definitely stained the floor boards but I was too busy trying to move to care. I grabbed my phone and checked the time. 

11:04 am. Okay, so not as bad as it could have been, but definitely late enough to not make it to my shift. Damn it.

Holding my shoulder, I finally made my way to the door, opening it as my eyes moved upwards to meet my visitor. 

Cassie.

As soon as the door was even slightly open, Cassie was making her way inside, moving past me but being careful to not push. In her hands was a medkit, it looked like the one we have under the bar in the bowling alley but I could tell it wasn’t as the handle looks smoother. She placed the medkit down onto my coffee table as she quickly opened it, motioning me to sit down. 

“Cassie, what are you doing here?” I asked, sitting down as she began to lay out a lot of medical materials that I couldn’t even begin to name. 

“You weren’t at the alley, I knew something was wrong. My parents always told me to be prepared.” Cassie’s parents, “the doctors”, as everyone referred to them. I haven’t been able to meet them or even see them yet but it seemed like they taught their daughter a lot. “Why didn’t you call me?” She asked. I looked at her, confused.

“Well, I really don’t think we know each other like that.” I confessed, because we don’t, not really.

“Yeah, but I know stuff, I could have gotten my parents to help. I- It doesn’t matter.” In Cassie’s hand, she held some sort of ointment and a few wipes. “I need to get to the bite, can you?” She made a motion with her own button up as I blushed to myself before copying the best I could, removing my shirt but wincing every time the fabric touched my shoulder. Cassie must have noticed my discomfort as she grabbed the scissors from the kit and cut the remaining fabric off. 

I was upset, that had been my favourite shirt, but it was already ruined with the amount of blood that was on it. 

“How do you know it’s a bite mark?” I asked, one of my hands holding onto my chest to keep my bra up. Cassie just sighed.

“Stay still.” From the kit, she grabbed some tweezers, pulling slowly until I felt something sharp as she pulled. I gritted my teeth as she showed me what she had pulled out before placing it down. 

A whole tooth. 

“When you’ve been in Astoria falls long enough, you notice bite marks.” After that, Cassie was rather quiet, slowly cleaning up my shoulder wounds. She tried to be as gentle as she could, but still sometimes I could feel twinges of pain with each small touch. She looked up at me. “Can you turn around?” I nodded, turning my body and grabbing onto my hair so it would not get in her way. 

For a second, Cassie paused. I already knew why.

Something I hadn’t mentioned yet is the reason why I was bloodied when I was found at age seven. 

It wasn’t someone else’s blood, but my own. 

When I was found, I had two identical wounds that spanned my back, both in the middle of my back yet still far away to be symmetrical on me. Through the years, I’ve always had these scars, reminders of a childhood I could not remember. They were not as large as they had once been, now mostly healed and seemingly smaller now that I have grown, but they were still quite noticeable. 

“Sorry.” Cassie whispered and I just sighed. 

“It’s fine, I’m used to it.” I let my eyes closed, trying to ignore the stinging pain as Cassie cleaned the wounds, slowly wiping it away. I could feel the dried blood as it was slowly wiped away. 

That’s how we spent over an hour of our time together, as Cassie cleaned my wounds, slowly dressing it until I had a patch that wrapped all the way around my shoulder. 

The pain wasn’t as bad as it had been when she had begun, but it still lingered across my body. 

A part of me thought about calling in sick to work and honestly, maybe I should have. Maybe I should have stayed home, convinced Cassie to stay with me, convince her that she had to watch my wounds to make sure they didn’t get infected, convince her I was scared that something else might show up. 

But I didn’t.

Instead, I thanked her for her help, told her I would call if anything happens and that I’ll go get a rabies shot from the hospital soon, then let her leave. To be honest, the rabies part was a lie, I don’t have enough money and I’m not insured for that, I just said it to make her leave. But if I start getting scared of water, I’ll let her know. 

So, once she left, I got out of my clothes, put them all in the wash but I knew that I would probably have to throw some of them away. I got changed, fed Diane, and left. 

I know I should have stayed home, but when you have as much money as I have, you take every shift you can get. 

When I made it to the bowling alley, I expected Q to shout at me, yell at responsibilities, maybe even dock some of my pay. 

But he didn’t. 

He just stared at me, sympathy in his eyes. I don’t even think he expected me to show up. But still, he didn’t say a word to me, he just let me sit behind the bar as he went back upstairs. 

Ariel came down once, but she didn’t stay, going out to see Hope instead. Even Jordan, who normally annoys me for hours on end, didn’t talk to me, just smiled and waved at me before going off to clean some bowling balls and alleys. 

I didn’t say much my entire shift either. We did get one customer however, this was pretty uneventful like most days. 

By the time my break was about to begin, Q came back downstairs and told me to leave. He was going to close up. I was going to protest but when I saw his face, I just sighed and accepted it, leaving for the day. 

But I didn’t go home, not yet. Instead, I went to a little bookstore that sat three shops away from us.

The only worker of this bookstore was a man called Finn. Well, I call him a man, but he looks younger than me. I'm not even sure if he’s twenty yet, but I’ve never asked. I’ve only seen him a few times, but never outside the bookstore. Sometimes, I wonder if he lives there. 

Still, I asked if I could go to the second room in the bookstore and Finn accepted. It was more a small private room than anything but it helped sometimes. Andy had shown it to me as a way for me to relax, “So I wasn’t alone in that cold house”, he told me.

The room was rather small, with a few chairs and an old weathered sofa that had a blanket thrown over it to cover the damage. There was a large carpet that covered most of the dusty floorboards which was pretty much nailed down by the legs of the table that laid on top of it. 

So I did what I did the few times I have entered this store, I sat down and just breathed. Everyone needs a break sometimes and this is how I have mine. The chair I sat on was rickety, threatening to break into pieces and creak every time it was given even the tiniest pressure. It wasn’t the best place to sit, but it beats sitting on that mashed up sofa. 

So as I sat, I did something that I really normally didn’t do, I began to swing. Not on purpose, I just had to. It was like a part of me was begging me to do it.

But that was a mistake, because as I moved on that creaking chair, I soon found myself crashing down and smashing into the carpet below.

I silently cursed, looking back at the pieces of wood which had once been a chair. 

Finn didn’t come to see if I was okay, but I just assumed that maybe he knew that the chair was on its last leg, literally. 

As I went to get up and dust myself up, I noticed something about a floorboard that had picked itself up from the impact. 

Confused, I pushed the table leg a few inches and flipped the carpet up, revealing bare wooden floorboards that were easy for me to just pick up and move out of the way, although my other shoulder protested my every move. 

Moving two boards, I saw something thick wrapped in a cloth. I gently removed the cloth, placing it down slowly as I turned my attention on the item. 

I gasped, my eyes checking twice that I was truly seeing what I thought I was seeing.

Under the floorboards or this tiny little bookstore, covered by a carpet and a table, was the book I had remembered from my childhood. A leather bound beast of a book with large angel wings on the front of it. 

I let out a gasp that almost became a laugh, I truly couldn’t believe what I had found.

My fingers moved to grab the pages, to flip it open, but I couldn’t. The pages wouldn’t budge, like they were stuck together. I hummed with annoyance, trying to pry it open but still it wouldn’t move.

I dug my fingernails into the book, trying to open it, and finally, something fell out of the book.

I didn’t have enough time to see what it was, I just picked up the thin paper-like item, tucked it into my pocket and quickly covered the book once more, smoothing out the carpet over the floorboards and using my leg to pull the table back into place. 

I sat on the floor for a moment, processing everything. 

Does anyone else know that this is here? How did I find it so easily?

I had no idea but I didn’t have any time as I heard what sounded like screaming outside. 

I stood up, moving to leave the little room and the store altogether, as I heard it again. A little voice that made my heart thump.

“Stay.” It told me, but I didn’t listen.

I waved goodbye to Finn, forgetting to tell him about his now broken chair and left, running the best I could out as I saw a group of people, including Andy, Hope and Ariel, all moving quickly towards the bowling alley.

My heart pumped against my chest, a million ideas running through my mind, and I followed after them.

Joining them, we entered the bowling alley and I felt myself almost vomit.

Because in that bowling alley was Cassie as she loomed over a woman that sat tied up. On the woman’s forehead, I saw it. 

That same bloodied carving I had seen on many people’s backs. 

My name.

May.

I almost threw up, trying to look away as my head ached. Cassie noticed me and came striding towards me but I could barely tell what was happening as Hope separated herself from Ariel, moving slowly towards the woman and whispered.

“Mama?” 

The older ginger haired woman who sat looked up at Hope, a toothy grin on her face with too many teeth than the normal human. 

“Hi, baby.” She said sweetly, but there was something so sinister about her voice and the way she spoke, I couldn’t place it. “I’ve missed you.” 

Hope turned away from her mother and moved back towards Ariel, obviously trying to hide tears that were attempting to form. 

I looked at the tied up woman, then at Cassie.

“What’s going on?” I asked.

“I found this cult member near the forest, so I brought her here to try and get some answers out of her.” 

“And the writing?” I said, as I really didn’t know how to describe it. 

“Did it herself, I think. I think they’re planning on attacking soon.” I felt confused.

“What about the murders, haven’t they been attacking already?” Cassie looked at me like I had grown two heads.

“Wait, did Andy not tell you?” My eyes glided over to where Andy stood.

“Tell me what?” I questioned.

“May, that creature that tried to attack you on your birthday, that was from the cult.” I looked back at Cassie.

“But, how could you know that?” Cassie sighed, placing a hand on my non injured shoulder.

“Because… I was the one that saved you.” 

No, no, this isn’t real, right? It couldn’t be. I backed away from Cassie, closing my eyes as I bolted out of the bowling alley. 

I knew she was following me but I didn’t care, I just wanted to leave. 

I climbed into my truck, grabbing my keys as I tried to leave.

Cassie came storming out, banging on my truck’s window.

“Please, May, you don’t understand.” She begged.

“Don’t understand what? That you’re a monster?” She looked hurt by my words but still she did not leave.

“No, I’m-”“You’re what?” I interjected, staring at her.

“An angel.” I stared at her, not saying a word until I slowly twisted my truck’s key.

“Goodbye, Cassie.” I bluntly told her, leaving her behind as I drove my way home.

I could see her in my mirrors as I left but I didn’t dare turn back around. An angel? Seriously?

It was stupid and even if that was true, then she slaughtered another creature in front of me. But that wasn’t Cassie, she wouldn’t do something like that.

I got home rather quickly, had I been driving faster than normal? 

I sighed, sitting in my truck, going to leave when I checked my pockets and finally saw what fell out of the book. 

It was a photograph of me, a tiny little five year old girl, being held by both my parents. I tried not to cry as I flipped over the photograph and read the few words written in black marker.

“**Silas Newman & Mara Preston with daughter May, age five. The perfect vessel.”**

Just before I could truly take in what I had just read, I looked up at my mirror and saw two deep black eyes staring back at me. I went to scream, but I couldn’t.

That was the last thing I remembered before I was knocked out cold and woke up in the forest, being held up by cult members in front of a waterfall.

1m1ay1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1m1ay1r/think_i_may_have_gerd/,Think I may have GERD,"Hi all, I’m really frustrated and anxious. I am a healthy 42 year old woman, I eat healthfully and workout daily. In mid-June, I experienced heart palpitations in the gym. At bedtime, I was burping and had some additional chest pain. This is unusual. My husband was concerned I was having a heart attack so he took me to the emergency room. Of course, nothing. 

I have had an extremely stressful spring, and I know my anxiety has been higher than normal, but I thought I was coping well. I don’t take any medication for it. 

After returning from the hospital, I took Pepcid for about 4 days, started feeling better and stopped taking it. One week later, my husband deployed, and the reflux symptoms returned full force. 

Here are my symptoms: constant gnawing pain in stomach when empty, burping and noise in esophagus (no burning but sometimes liquid comes up-especially at night), and nausea. I do sleep on an incline now. My primary care physician put me on omeprazole. I initially felt a little better, but after day 5, my symptoms got progressively worse and included globus sensation, sore throat, and esophageal spasms. My doctor switched me to famotidine. I take 20 mg in morning and 20 mg in evening. This seems to help, but I am still having some trouble with reflux at night. It’s exhausting. I’m supplementing with Tums but I’m reluctant to continue taking them (taking 2-3 a day). 

This seems like it came out of nowhere, but I do believe my anxiety is playing a huge role in this. I do take a daily baby aspirin for an injury that caused a stroke three years ago, so that may be contributing. Also, I woke up twice in the spring choking on my saliva when sleeping on my back, but I also have allergies which caused post-nasal drip so I assumed that’s what I was dealing with. I do have occasional (less than twice a week) nausea/reflux if I don’t eat for several hours. I used to sleep 9 hours a night, now I can barely sleep 5. 

I’m currently eating less than 1100 calories a day because of the nausea, and I’ve lost 5 lbs in two weeks. Keep in mind I lift 5 times a week, and walk 3 miles every morning and already at a lower healthy BMI. I usually eat about 1700 a day.  I cut out coffee and any trigger food on the list. Honestly, it’s empty stomach that seems to trigger my symptoms, no food. 

Should I switch back to the omeprazole? Is that truly the only way to heal this? Did I not give myself enough time on it? I’m currently waiting to get into GI specialist. 

I cannot take most PPIs because I take levothyroxine every day for my thyroid. 

TL;DR: I developed uncontrollable acid reflux seemingly out of nowhere after a very stressful spring and summer. I do have anxiety. Bad experience with omeprazole, switched to famotidine, helping but not entirely. Not eating; losing weight; not sleeping; waiting on GI specialist appointment. What can I do now?

You might be thinking:

**“Is this one of those long surveys?”** Nope. It’s short — under 3 minutes.

**“What’s in it for me?”** You get a ***$5 Amazon gift card,*** no catch. We send it straight to your business email.

**“What’s this all about?”**  
We’re building a super simple all-in-one platform for micro fleets — stuff like dispatch, fuel logs, tax forms — without the overkill. But we don’t want to guess what to build. We want to hear it from the people actually living it, to solve their actual problems.

**“Is this some corporate-broken thing?”**  
Not at all. Just a small team (me included), trying to get it right from the start — with real input, not marketing fluff.

And if you're feeling lucky:  
At the end of the form, you can opt in to be one of **10 paid beta testers**. We’ll pick a few folks to try out the first version, give feedback, and get paid for their time. Could be you.

I could only afford to buy coffee kung maka meron, or chicken. Thought ko nga sa self ko kanina while going home was ""I'm not fit to live life alone, pero here I am"". I just get sad over how hard it is to be me right now. Would it be easier if I was with someone right now? Pero I really don't complain kasi pagod na ako in some aspects of my life.

I prayed to God na rin kasi yun lang yung svenue ko to speak to someone. Wala rin akong friends na mapuntahan during these difficult days. Kung meron man siguro mag borrow lang ganun. Nahiya na rin ako mag seek ng emotional support kasi they feel emotionally absent like my parents. Pero gusto ko mag express sa kanila how hard my life is. People see me kasi na strong, independent, matatag, optimistic. Kaya siguro wala nang nagtatanong kung okay pa, kung kaya ko pa. Nasanay na rin ako sa ganitong way of living and I've become solitary kahit na I crave attention every day. Sometimes I wish it was also easier on my end.

Logic shatters, through the falling rain
Down the abyss, a silent, endless fall
Elara's echoes, tearing through it all.

Every morning, a familiar sigh
Not of newness, but moments gone by.
Coffee's whisper, newsprint in the light
A thousand scenes, rehearsed within the night.

Her world, an echo, eternally entwined
No longer strange, the loop she left behind.
A perfect actress, a script she seemed to know,
No room for chance, no place for seeds to grow.

Dreams are not fancies, bending to her will.
They are the lessons, precursors of the day,
Past examples guiding Elara on her way.

Precise reminders, answering memory's call.

Strange machines and light, behind a closing door.
A frantic voice, a sphere that burst in dread,
A chilling tremor, thoughts unlaid to bed.
Waking soaked in sweat, the air unfamiliar, cold,
""This is new,"" she whispered, a story left untold.
(Verse 4)
The coffee wavered, the headlines subtly wrong,
The déjà vu itself, a broken, fractured song.
Skewed recognition, a rhythm torn apart,
A trembling world, a beating, panicked heart.
She searched for answers, where did this dream belong?
No past connection, a dissonant, haunting gong.
(Chorus)
Every morning, no familiar sigh
But fractured moments, where echoes pass by.
Coffee's whisper, fading in the light
The thousand scenes, now lost within the night.
(Outro)
Then came the flash, a searing, blinding white,
A younger self, bathed in that terrible light.
Wires and screens, her own voice, wild and deep,
A hidden purpose, secrets she did keep.
The loop was breaking, a truth she couldn't deny,
The architect of freedom, beneath a fractured sky.
Was it repair? Or chaos's icy hand?
As Elara watched her prison-world disband...
The dream of that room, no longer example's art,
But the twisted reality, breaking her shattered heart.

Since we currently have a lot of corners and hard edges in the room, we’re leaning towards a rounder, more organic shape of some sort, likely in a wood tone that would go with our walnut-y side table. I’ve liked the idea of doing a live edge or cross section wood slab table - the latter would fit the bill for both color and shape. We also briefly considered trying to refinish our current table, but we’ve been warned away from that path by others who have attempted it with the same piece previously.

They think it’s just about waking up at 5 AM and being productive.  
But a powerful morning ritual has a much deeper purpose: it’s the time you load the software for the day.

You can’t expect to wake up, scroll through the chaos of social media and news, and then perform at an elite level.  
You’ve already let other people’s priorities and negativity infect your operating system.

A real reboot means being the first voice your mind hears in the morning.

Here’s the 15-minute ritual I refined over the past two years:

1. Hydrate: Before coffee, before anything, drink a full glass of water. You're waking up your physical body.
2. Remind: Read your goals. Read your manifesto. Look at your vision board. Remind your mind what game it's playing today. This is you setting the hypothesis for a successful day.
3. Prime: Read your affirmations or write in your gratitude journal. Program your mind with the beliefs and emotions of the person you are becoming.
4. Plan: Look at your schedule and define the 1-3 most important priorities for the day.

This entire process can take just 10-15 minutes, but it changes everything.   
You stop starting your day in a state of reaction and begin it in a state of intention.

I’ll admit I was skeptical at first, but I gave it a try. Now I'm making around $200–$250 a day, and it doesn’t take much time at all. Honestly, I didn’t believe it at first either.

He’s not asking for anything in return, but I’m sure he’d appreciate a small thank-you (like a coffee) if it ends up working for you too.

We met on a dating app two years ago. At the time, we lived in different countries (we matched while he was vacationing in my home country). At first, things were great. We clicked easily, had a lot in common, and video chatted regularly. But when we met in person two months later, things started to shift.

I won’t go into all the details, but our in-person dates became unpredictable. Sometimes they were genuinely great, but other times, he’d make condescending comments—about things like my taste in coffee, fish, or just my opinions in general. That would set me off. I get that he’s smart and well-read, but that doesn’t give him the right to act so superior about my personal preferences.

We ended up stuck in a push-pull pattern. We weren’t officially together, both talked to other people, but kept gravitating back to each other. He’d apologize after fights, tell me I was special to him, and we’d reconnect. Then, inevitably, he’d pull away again after starting some pointless argument. I know this sounds bad, but I kept giving him chances. I saw the good in him—his values, his intelligence—but I kept telling him that his arrogance was pushing me away.

The last time we were together, I promised myself it’d be his final chance. He came over for a casual evening: we planned to cook dinner together and play video games. At first, everything was fine… until he pulled out his phone and started playing chess. Ten minutes passed, then twenty, then thirty. He ignored me the entire time, just playing his game. I felt ridiculous just sitting there, so I started watching a documentary about an actor accused of a serious crime. He glanced over and made a dismissive comment like, “Wasn’t he acquitted? These kinds of documentaries are basically defamation. Stupid.” It was said in such a condescending tone, and he didn’t even know the full story.

At that point, I was already upset, so I just brushed it off. After about 30 minutes of being ignored, I told him, “It’s getting late, let’s start cooking.” He said he’d join me, but didn’t. I started cooking alone. When he finally came into the kitchen, he noticed I was tearing up. His reaction? “Why are you crying? Just because I’m playing chess? That’s insane. You’re overreacting.”

I tried explaining that I didn’t understand why he’d suddenly gone cold and dismissive. He told me it was all in my head, said the kitchen was cold, and went back to the couch… to keep playing. I cooked dinner alone, set the table, waited for him for ten more minutes before I gave up and started eating. Only then did he join me, saying, “You didn’t say dinner was ready. When I’m playing, I don’t notice anything else.”

At that point, I felt completely disrespected and honestly embarrassed. I kept thinking, this is pathetic… he’s 40 years old, acting like a teenager. After that night, we didn’t speak for a week. Now he’s texting me to go for a walk, acting like nothing happened.

I feel i'm done with him and i don't want to see him again, but keep wondering—am I being too sensitive? But honestly, after writing all this out, I think I wasn’t overreacting at all. I probably should have asked him to leave.
So am i really overreacting? And how do you think i should end this relationship while keeping it mature and civil ?",3,1752666954.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,6,1.0,False

# Insight

We can observe two things from the disciples’ response to Jesus’ question, “Who do people say I am?” ([Mark 8:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208%3A27&version=NIVUK)). First, the disciples knew what the people were saying about who Jesus was: “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets” ([v. 28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208%3A28&version=NIVUK)). They weren’t simply an isolated and insulated group, oblivious to the culture and people around them. His disciples continued to interact with and understand the people to whom Christ was reaching out. One day soon, they’d be sent to continue His message. Second, the people’s various answers to who Jesus was illustrated that even people who heard and saw Him had different opinions about Him. But Jesus wasn’t content with general answers to the question of who He was. He asked His disciples this question directly. Peter answered, “You are the Messiah” ([v. 29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208%3A29&version=NIVUK)).

But what’s the reality in 2025?

### Bitcoin ATMs

- Over 38,000 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide  
- Mostly used for buying BTC with cash, not spending BTC  
- Limited merchant support for Bitcoin payments linked to ATMs  
- Fees can be as high as 10% on ATM transactions

### Merchant Adoption

- A handful of major companies accept Bitcoin, but many are using payment processors that instantly convert BTC to fiat  
- Real Bitcoin payments at point-of-sale remain rare  
- High fees and slow confirmation times discourage everyday use

### On-Chain Payments

- Bitcoin’s base layer is congested and costly for small payments  
- Second-layer solutions like Lightning Network promise microtransactions but face user experience challenges  
- Lightning adoption is growing but not mainstream yet

### The Gap Between Promise and Practice

The idea that you can “buy coffee with Bitcoin” is still mostly aspirational.

Most users and businesses prefer faster, cheaper, and more scalable solutions for daily transactions.

### What This Means

Bitcoin is primarily a **store of value** and speculative asset today.

Real, everyday use cases remain limited.

### The Bigger Picture

The crypto space is evolving with coins designed for **instant, low-cost payments** — from stablecoins to newer layer 1s optimized for scalability.

These are the projects tackling Bitcoin’s usability problems head-on.

Bitcoin’s adoption story is real but **incomplete**.

1m1aj7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_switrusholidays/comments/1m1aj7y/10_travel_mistakes_to_avoid_in_europe/,10 Travel Mistakes to Avoid in Europe,"So, you’ve finally booked that dream trip to Europe. Maybe you're chasing castles in Austria, pasta in Italy, or the fairytale charm of Eastern Europe. Whether you're going solo or through well-crafted [**Europe tour packages from Mumbai**](https://switrus.com/), there are a few things you *don’t* want to mess up.

Europe is stunning, diverse, and oh-so-easy to fall in love with. But even seasoned travelers can make simple mistakes that turn dream vacations into ""wish-I-had-known"" moments. Let’s help you skip the regrets with this list of 10 common travel mistakes to avoid while exploring Europe.

# 1. Trying to Do Too Much in Too Little Time

Europe isn’t going anywhere, we promise! One of the biggest mistakes travelers make is cramming five countries into a 10-day itinerary. You’ll end up spending more time on trains and flights than actually enjoying the sights. Focus on a region—like Eastern Europe or Western Europe—and explore it deeply. Quality over quantity always wins in Europe.

# 2. Not Checking Visa and Schengen Rules

If you're traveling from India, especially on one of those all-inclusive [**Europe tour packages from Mumbai**](https://switrus.com/), don’t assume a visa for one country gives you access to all. Some countries outside the Schengen Zone (like Croatia until recently or the UK) have separate visa requirements. Always double-check, or better yet, let your travel agent handle it.

# 3. Ignoring Local Customs and Etiquette

In Europe, cultural etiquette matters. Don’t be the loud tourist on the metro or the one who forgets to greet shopkeepers with a “Bonjour” or “Guten Tag.” These small gestures go a long way. In places like Eastern Europe, where traditions run deep, respecting local norms shows you're a thoughtful traveler, not just another tourist.

# 4. Using Only Taxis

Sure, taxis can be convenient, but they’re also expensive and sometimes unnecessary. Most European cities have excellent public transportation. Trams in Prague, metros in Paris, and buses in Budapest are not just cost-effective—they’re part of the local experience. Also, you’ll avoid getting scammed by sneaky drivers.

# 5. Not Carrying Enough Cash

While Europe is mostly card-friendly, many smaller towns, markets, or cafes still prefer cash, especially in Eastern Europe. Carry a small amount of local currency at all times, and don’t rely on your credit card everywhere.

# 6. Skipping Travel Insurance

This one’s boring but essential. Lost baggage, delayed flights, or a twisted ankle while hiking in the Alps—anything can happen. Many curated [**Europe Tour Packages**](https://switrus.com/) include travel insurance, but double-check the fine print. It’s a small cost for peace of mind.

# 7. Wearing the Wrong Shoes

This one’s for the fashionistas: leave the heels at home. Europe = cobblestone streets. Whether you’re exploring the ruins of Rome or strolling across Charles Bridge in Prague, a comfy pair of shoes is your best friend.

# 8. Not Booking in Advance

Europe gets crowded, especially during summer. Popular attractions like the Eiffel Tower or the Colosseum often require reservations. Booking your tours, trains, and activities ahead of time, especially with customized [**Europe tour packages**](https://switrus.com/)**,** saves you time and money—and keeps the FOMO away.

# 9. Assuming Everyone Speaks English

While many Europeans do speak English, it’s not universal, especially in rural areas of Eastern Europe. Learning a few basic phrases in the local language shows respect and can make your interactions smoother and more enjoyable.

# 10. Forgetting to Slow Down and Enjoy

Lastly, don’t rush. Europe is best experienced slowly—sipping coffee at a Parisian café, getting lost in the alleys of Venice, or chatting with locals at a Croatian market. Some of the best memories happen when you least expect them.

# Final Thoughts

Europe is a patchwork of cultures, flavors, and experiences, and whether you're exploring iconic capitals or uncovering the magic of [**Eastern Europe**](https://switrus.com/), the key is to travel smart. Avoid these mistakes, and your trip will be smoother, richer, and way more memorable.

I RECEIVED TWO JOB OFFERS

**What I would love to know:**

\- the market is dry AF atm for graduates. IT'S NOT YOU. THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN AS \*\*\*.

\- multiple organizations are not even hiring atm, they are covering up with job postings.

\- giving up something is fine, but not everything; you need to know what you are seeking the most at the moment (title, salary, job relocation, stability, prestige, company)

\- Invest in yourself, try to get on track with AI, do voluntaring, do sports, start an Instagram channel, Youtube Channel.

\- This period will come to an end way to early than expected ... ENJOY the process to have free time. Engage with new hobbies, meet new people through community runs. I couldn't go on vacation during this time. If you don't have the cash, do volunteering perhaps with workaday.

\- no one will understand you if they haven't undergone this same process. Don't seek too much support from family and friends.  I was supprised how my friends and family couldn't understand it. Seek professional help

\- please take care of yourself, I got pretty mentally sick for 2 months,  due to excessive rejections. I was taking everything personally. WHY ME.. AGAIN? I SUFFERED ENOUGH FOR THE PAST MONTHS. CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME A JOB?

\- Take any opportunities that come to you... I rejected a few, even working in a coffee shop / bars / library ... you will have human interaction, and not alone.

\- Don't try to plan, it will come anything but planned.

\- Find yourself a hobby (skills/ competencies) that you will invest time on... I tried so many things during my unemployment, I was all over the place from moderating, to coaching, to writing, to instagramming... prioritize.

**As soon as I** underwent **my mental breakdown, I was less emotionally attached** to **interview process. I was more chilled during interviews.**

\- Tell yourself that you will get the job, write it down, write it on a piece of paper, and during the interview, look at these words !! I did it once, I received the job.

**What about applying for job, interviewing?**

**-** I invested too much time\*\*,\*\* 8hours 6 days a week. Don't do that! I would recommend investing 4 hours / day 5 days a week.

\- Create your own AI agent connected with *make . com*  to extract the keywords from the job title / description etc.

\- Send out 5 applications per week if possible - sometimes, I couldn't as the market was super try in innovation between December and March.

\- Don't minimize your competencies, skills. I promise you if you continue to upskill yourself during this time, you are doing better than 98% of the employeed people out there... (I noticed it as I am working on a volunteering basis for a startup commitee...)

\- Be curious during the interviews, ask questions.

\- Be genuine but not too much. I am very transparent during the interviews, I wouldn't recommend it, your interviewer shouldn't know everything from you

\- Look at your interview partner before !!! Perhaps you have things in common, that's something memorable, don't miss the opportunities.

**What about ghosting?**

\- Don't expect to receive genuine feedback from any organization. I haven't received any. Do the job by yourself !! Reflect .... be authentic with yourself. You will get out more than any feedback.

**Tools?**

\- Yes, sure, use ChatGPT for creating your own GPT's with all your information

\- Tailor your CV for each role

\- Invest time to do a GREAT motivation letter and after use GPT to adjust based on the requirements

\- make to automate the extracting of key words

\- Notion, created my own template, added the google chrome extension !!

**What did I learn?**

\- If they want you, you will notice it in a few hours/days. After the second interview, I received within 1 hour for the next interview!!

Something that you should remember\*\*\*:\*\*\* ***""Your job doesn't state how much you are worth""; ""Rejection doesn't mean you are not*** meant ***to have a job"".***

1m1aiw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextCryptoMoonshots/comments/1m1aiw0/bitcoin_vs_fiat_1012_inflation_vs_21_million_cap/,Bitcoin vs Fiat: 10–12% Inflation vs 21 Million Cap — What Matters More Today?,"Fiat currencies around the world are experiencing inflation rates of 10–12% or even higher. Governments print more money, and purchasing power steadily erodes.

Bitcoin, with its hard cap of 21 million coins, presents a stark contrast — designed to be scarce and deflationary by nature.

But let’s take a closer look beyond the headlines.

### The Inflation Problem

- Fiat inflation means your savings lose value over time  
- Everyday prices rise, squeezing budgets  
- Central banks try to control inflation but often fail

### Bitcoin’s Scarcity

- Fixed supply capped at 21 million BTC  
- No more new Bitcoins after the last one is mined (estimated ~2140)  
- Scarcity should theoretically preserve value

### The Usability Issue

Bitcoin’s network today struggles with:

- High transaction fees, sometimes $10+ per transfer  
- Slow confirmation times during congestion  
- Limited scalability without complex second-layer solutions

This makes using Bitcoin for everyday purchases — like your morning coffee — impractical for many.

### Why Practical Usability Matters

Holding a scarce asset is good, but it’s worthless if you can’t spend it efficiently.

People want to:

- Hedge against inflation  
- **And** use their money for daily needs  

### Enter Coins with Capped Supply and Scalability

Some newer projects offer:

- Hard supply caps like Bitcoin  
- Scalable, low-cost transactions  
- Fast confirmation times  
- User-friendly wallets and integrations

These coins aim to be both a **store of value** and a **medium of exchange**.

### The Real Question

Is it enough to be scarce if you can’t actually use it?

Hedge inflation, but still be able to pay for your morning coffee — is that too much to ask?

1m1aexm,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1m1aexm/joint_pains_and_circulation_issues/,Joint pains and circulation issues,"I'm a 27 year old male, and I'm in my 4th month of treatment with Vyvanse. Over the last month I've been having increasingly upsetting issues to the point now where I'm certain something is wrong.

I'll give a bit of a backstory to the health of my elders and then myself before presenting the issue.

I've got grandparents with heart, circulation, and joint issues on both sides. My paternal grandfather had CHF (among other issues) and was on blood thinners, my maternal grandmother has (IIRC) Mitral Valve Prolapse, and very bad Arthritis, particularly in her hands.

I've always suffered some sort of joint pain but it's typically noticible in my knees, back, and wrists, I've had x-rays on my knees, and even an MRI on my spine, but there's ""nothing wrong"". I've always had a bit of a funky heart too, having noticible palpitations and assorted arythmias as of about 15 years old. I've had many scary occasions where I've developed chest pain, tunnel vision, and nearly blacked out during some and subsequently ended up in ambulances and/or at hospital, having many ECGs, as well as performing cardiac strain tests, and an echocardiogram, even wearing a 48hr Holter monitor twice, but there's still ""nothing wrong"". All they've captured are a few minor palpitations, which don't typically disturb me much anyway, said my heart is healthy and it's likely a node problem, and there ain't much they can do about that. I've always had cold feet too, so as far as I'm concerned, I do believe I have some sort of joint and heart/circulation issues.

Regardless of professionals telling me I'm fine, I certainly don't feel like I'm fine, I physically feel like I'm twice my age. I've felt like this for a long time. Life goes on however.

About a month ago, I first noticed pain in my toes. Over the course of two days the pain went from barely noticible to barely able to walk. I thought it was Gout. However, it went away after a few days so I didn't think much of it. It did come back but in waves and was far less intense, to the point it wasnt an issue, I just ignored it. Over the last two weeks, I've been having more issues than ever. It is the middle of winter where I live (New Zealand), and quite a cold one, but I don't think it's just the cold causing this. I started experiencing numbness, pain, and restricted movement in my toes and fingers. One day, some of my toes were itchy, and two of them were unbarably itchy. I took off my socks later in the day and I had developed what looked to be chilblains on 2 of the toes on my left foot. In regards to my fingers, I couldn't make a fist, and even taking the lid off my water bottle was a struggle due to the pain. I'm on my feet all day and I use hand tools and machinery so having issues with my feet and hands is not good. The pain isn't all day, it comes in waves, particularly at night, but when it happens, it's intense, in about 5 minutes it goes from noticible to painful. It will go away on its own accord

I stopped taking 70mg Vyvanse, upon reading that it can exacerbate pre-existing conditions similar to what I was experiencing. Two days off, plus thermal gloves and socks, and I physically felt better, but my brain went back to mush in the second day so I've been splitting 2x 70mg into 3 capsules for 46mg per day. The chilblains have pretty much gone away and my feet feel fine, but my fingers are still an issue. I've had to deal with this for 2 weeks as my doctor was fully booked, but don't worry, I am seeing her soon.

I've seen other Reddit posts where people claim they experienced similar issues on extended release formulas (Vyvanse, Adderall XR, Concerta XR) and their symptoms decreased when they switched to immediate release formulas. So im going to give that a go. Life on Dex is so much better than life without it, but if these physical symptoms are being exacerbated because of it, I'm not sure if it's worth it. It hurts, i'd describe how my fingers feel as similar to how it would feel if they were smashed really hard in a ranch slider the day before.

I had to have an ECG before starting Vyvanse treatment to check my heart would handle it and everything checked out, so I'm not trying to claim that Vyvanse is definitely causing this, but I think it's possible that it's contributing. 

To me, (and I'm not a doctor, but I'm also not an idiot) I think that I do in fact have a pre-dispositon to these conditions due to my family medical history, and my lifestyle at the moment, paired with the Vyvanse, is elevating symptoms that were previously negatable. I consume a moderate amount of caffeine (2-4 cups coffee a day, no energy drinks), a lot of nicotine (50mg salts vape that I'm now hooked on), I binge eat as I'm always hungry due to my metabolism (I'm tall and skinny), and consume a lot of salt, which I have cut back on. So I'm taking a lot of vasoconstrictors on a daily basis, paired with a medication that is a vasoconstrictor.

I don't even know where i'm going with this, I'm sort of answering my own questions as I type it out.

What do you think? Have you experiencing anything similar? Am I an idiot for continuing my medication + lifestyle while experiencing these issues? I am a couch-bound depressed looser without medication, the idea of not taking it anymore sucks big time, I've achieved so much in these 4 months 🥺",1,1752666319.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

I was artsy. Sensitive. Always writing weird little poems or getting too emotionally attached to characters in books. My dad? More of a “fix the gutters, drink black coffee, never cry at movies” kind of guy.

He wasn’t mean. Just… quiet. Present, but not expressive. Never gave big speeches. Never said “I’m proud of you.” Never said much at all.

So I built this story in my head that he didn’t really understand me. That maybe I was just too different. Too soft.

Then, a few months ago, I went home to visit. He’d been cleaning out the garage. I was walking past when I noticed a dusty old plastic bin on the workbench labeled “kid stuff.”

Curious, I popped it open.

Inside?

Every award I’d ever gotten. Every school photo. Programs from my middle school plays. Even this random, *cringeworthy* poem I wrote in 7th grade about how clouds are “God’s soft regrets.”

I laughed so hard I nearly cried.

But what got me was this: tucked in the bottom was a short story I wrote in high school, something I barely remembered submitting to a writing contest. I didn’t win anything. It never got published.

But he kept it.

He *kept* it.

And in the top corner, in pencil, he’d written:  
**“I think he’s going to be something.”**

That was the moment it all rewired in my head.

He *was* paying attention.  
He *was* proud.  
He just didn’t say it in capital letters.

Now, when I talk to him, I listen more for the things he doesn’t say out loud. The way he sends me articles about writers he thinks I’d like. The fact that he still prints out my blog posts, even though I told him the internet exists.

I used to think we were speaking different languages.

Lately I've seen people:

- Eating bowls of oatmeal while driving
- Eating sandwiches while driving
- Eating Chinese food with chopsticks while driving

To me, this seems dangerous, and you should simply eat your meal in a parking lot, or on the side of the road rather than while driving through cities or on the highway.

If you are hungry and in too much of a rush to spend 5 minutes eating a meal, perhaps you should have a protein bar instead, or something else that only takes a couple of bites.

If you're going to eat while driving, at least eat a meal that doesn't require two hands or for you to wedge the food between your legs - e.g., eating Chinese food with chopsticks, or bowls of oatmeal with a spoon.

Eating a bowl of oatmeal while driving on the highway is bad.

Having a plate of lasagna while driving through a city would be bad too.

Drinking a cup of coffee is probably fine.

If you need to eat a meal while driving, and aren't being chased by ISIS, ICE, Hamas, MAGA, or a team of US Gravy SEALs: no, you don't.",2,1752666217.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,13,0.6,False

Like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



Here's my shot at an intro. 🙂

Love story telling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I’ll get back to my other love, history, but so far it’s mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after — all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?

I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely.

We are in the design phase right now for our new home and have a mostly finished floor plan.  Can you please look at it and provide suggestions/areas we may have overlooked.  We will be doing a three car garage and the laundry room will have side by side washer and dryer, but other than that I think this is what we are looking for.

I am especially interested in comments on room sizes.  Build is about $230/ft here so I am mindful of size, but don't want to end up with something too small.  Ceilings will be 9 or 10' and vaulted in the LR because our views are spectacular.  

It will have a full walkout basement with a rough in for another bedroom there and an enclosed workshop

Recently, a friend of mine — a total tech enthusiast and blockchain geek — stumbled upon a surprisingly effective way to make money. At first, he kept it to himself, just to see if it really worked. Spoiler: it did.

He ended up sharing the details on his profile \[u/splanket\], not to promote anything, but simply because he thought it might help someone else out. No paid courses, no entry fees — just a straightforward breakdown of what he's been doing.

I’ll admit I was skeptical at first, but I gave it a try. Now I'm making around $200–$250 a day, and it doesn’t take much time at all. Honestly, I didn’t believe it at first either.

He’s not asking for anything in return, but I’m sure he’d appreciate a small thank-you (like a coffee) if it ends up working for you too.

Long time lurker - first time writer. 

Jeg har et spørgsmål til de udviklere der sidder med webudvikling:  
'Hvis jeg paginater en PowerBI rapport inde på en hjemmeside, er der så noget jeg skal være opmærksom på ift. ikke at doxxe mig selv?'

Jeg har den sidste måneds tid leget med folketingets åbne data.   
Jeg blev træt af at vores kære politiker lovede en masse ting i en valgkamp, men hver gang man så Debatten på DR2, kunne man høre fra modsatrettede fløje at nogle politiker stemmer imod hvad de lover. Efter flere snakke med folketingets webmaster og en del timer brugt på at læse dokumentation er jeg der hvor data er testet og bekræftet. 

Det virker umuligt at finde hoved og hale i hvad fanden de faktisk stemmer på (og om) inde i folketinget, så jeg har lavet en PBI rapport. Planen er at den skal ud på en hjemmeside til gratis brug af danske borger - til de personer der er nørdede og kedelige som jeg og så vil følge med i hvad der faktisk sker inde på Christiansborg

Min tanke er blot at lave en super basic hjemmeside med et 'buy-me-a-coffee' link til dem der kunne have løst til at støtte med betaling af omkostninger ved at have hjemmesiden kørende. Men - hvis jeg paginater en rapport i HTML koden, risikerer jeg så at doxxe mig selv? Ideen med paginating er at alle kan bruge min PBI rapport uden at skulle have en PBI licens.

  
Men hvorfor bruger du overhoved PBI kære OP?  
Mest fordi jeg arbejder i PBI til dagligt, så det var et forsøg på at lave en rapport til mig selv. Men der pludselig begyndte at komme nogle indsigter som jeg synes burde være offentlig tilgængelig for alle danske borgere, så sad jeg allerede i suppedasen med at have valgt PBI som mit data-analyse værktøj.

Jeg har tilladt mig at vedhæft lidt billeder så i kan se hvordan rapport er sat op. Det er stadigvæk en demo da der mangler lidt kærlighed på farvevalget og piktogrammer. Dog, feedback modtages gerne med kyshånd. Om i synes ideen er værd at arbejde videre med, eller om den skal i skraldespanden er også feedback jeg er interesseret i.

Nogle enkelte tal jeg synes er interessante sådan over-all set.  
  
\- Der var 269 lovændringer/ lovforslag igennem sidste folketingsperiode. Ud af disse blev 155 vedtaget og 114 afvist.   


\- Igennem de 269 lovændringer/lovforslag har folketinget en samlet fraværs-% på 39%.   
\- Af dem som har de højeste fraværsprocenter ligger jeg selv mærke til Pia Olsen Dyhr (SF) har en fraværsprocent på 95%. Mig bekendt er hun ikke på barsel eller sygmeldt, så det virker som en absurd højt fraværsprocent.  


\- Det er kun 0.33% af alle lovforslag hvor alle 179 politiker har givet deres mening til kende. 

\- Enhedslisten er det parti med højst fraværsprocent (45% af alle afstemmelser har de haft nogle fraværende til)  


Ellers er det, efter min mening, ret interessant at dykke ned i de politikere der får en del skærmtid i Danmark og så se hvad de faktisk stemmer og laver på Christiansborg. Det er laaaaaaangt imellem hvad de siger i DR Nyhederne og hvad de faktisk stemmer.

ich bin jetzt schon seit über einem Jahr in einer Fernbeziehung. Mein Freund ist vor ein paar Monaten 18 geworden und Holländer (wohnt noch im Elternhaus), ich bin vor kurzem 20 geworden und wohne ca. 5,5 Stunden von ihm entfernt. Es läuft auch soweit alles gut und wir versuchen uns immer regelmäßig zu sehen. Meistens fahre ich dann nach Holland, weil seine Eltern ihm nicht erlauben, mit seinem Auto nach Deutschland zu fahren. 

Und hier fängt der ganze Spaß auch schon an. Ich bin so verzweifelt aktuell, weil ich nicht weiß, wie ich darüber denken soll. 

Er hat seinen Führerschein bereits schon etwas länger und fährt auch fleißig Auto - nur keine längeren Strecken, weil das seine Eltern nicht wollen. Schon alleine dieses Thema geht mir total auf die Nerven, ich hatte schon ganz oft Angeboten, ihm mit dem Zug oder so entgegen zu fahren, damit er nicht die ganze Strecke alleine fahren muss. Ich bin ein Mädchen und fahre IMMER alleine diese 550 km zu ihm, und ich habe meinen Führerschein auch ""erst seit"" 1,5 Jahren. 

Jetzt hatte ich vorgeschlagen, dass wir im August ein paar Tage zum Gardasee fahren könnten. Allerdings bräuchten wir dazu sein Auto, weil ich ein Leasing-Wagen habe, der in seinen Kilometern fast schon ausgeschöpft ist. Ich habe ihm gesagt, dass ich auch gerne sein Auto fahren kann und wir uns abwechseln könnten. 

Jetzt am Wochenende hatte ich eine lange und unangenehme Diskussion mit seinen Eltern. Diese haben angefangen zu Googeln und haben eine extra Liste geschrieben, warum die Italienreise auf gar keine Fall möglich wäre - angefangen bei der Maut (laut Google fängt die ja schon in Deutschland an...), zu den hohen Spritpreisen, bis hin zu den Serpentinen, die er mit seinem Auto auf gar keinen Fall fahren kann. Dann bräuchten wir ja alle noch Spezialimpfungen und spezielle Versicherungen und Dokumente... 

Ich war total sauer und verstehe es einfach nicht. So viele Freunde von mir Fahren weg, die Fahrt wäre von mir aus 7 Stunden. Seine Eltern meinten, fliegen wäre jedoch in Ordnung... die lassen ihn nicht nach Italien aber würde er auf einen anderen Kontinent fliegen, wäre das ok?! 

Nicht nur das ist ein gutes Beispiel dafür. Seine Eltern verbieten ihm (uns, und auch indirekt mir) viele Dinge. Sie wollten nicht, dass er sich PayPal holt, weil es gehakt werden könnte. Sie haben mir verboten, in Holland in einen CoffeeShop zu gehen. Wir dürfen nicht, wenn ich bei ihm bin, zu spät aufstehen und sollen regelmäßig nach unten kommen... einst musste ich ihn extra in Frankfurt holen, weil er da nicht alleine am Bahnhof auf den Zug warten wollte und durfte. Sein Bus war allerdings zu spät, dass ich dann diejenige war, die 2 Stunden alleine in Ffm gewartet hat.

Ich habe eine gute Beziehung zu seinen Eltern, sie sind wirklich sehr nett aber DAS geht meiner Meinung echt gar nicht. Wir beide sind volljährig und besonders ich sollte doch da nicht von seinen Eltern eingeschränkt werden. Ich verstehe das nicht. 

Ich habe auch schon mit meinem Freund geredet, aber er stimmt seinen Eltern zu und meint, das mit Italien wäre total verrückt... sagt mal, ob ihr schon mal mit einer Boy Mom zu tun hattet... ich lass mich doch nicht einschränken, aber erst recht verlasse ich doch meinen Freund nicht wegen seinen Eltern!!

We became “official” in the spring semester after assuming the role of bf/gf the entire time. (He took me home for the first time for Thanksgiving break). (Gotta love modern dating). (I don’t). 

Before we were “official” and after, he would see his ex girlfriend of 3 years on breaks. This bothered me, but I was the “chill gf” and acted as if it didn’t. It was “totally platonic” and important for them to “catch up” because they had so much history, and at this point, my bf and I didn’t. 

I would have to ask if they’ve seen each other, and he would be honest and say they did. They’d walk their dogs, get coffee, whatever. This went on until the following year, when I told him I did not want them seeing each other over Thanksgiving break. I then get a text: hey, (ex gf) asked me to go on a walk and I said yes, is that okay? I was like… tf? They went on their walk and afterward I told him that he crossed my boundary and that we weren’t compatible and we broke up. We get back to school and he’s so sorry and I mean so much more than she does and he’ll never do it again. We’re back together, and he hasn’t. 

Flash forward 2 years and we broke up again after both having real jobs over the summer. I was traveling and we didn’t see each other much and he was really upset about how much I responded to and reached out to him. 

(This was an ongoing thing that I claim responsibility for not giving him the attention he needs in a relationship. I would place him in a needier category and myself in a more independent category though. We would still call 1x a day at least😭. But still, it’s not as if it’s impossible for me to reach out more to make him happy)

This is kind of a side story but I think it’s important - while we were apart he texted his ex but deleted the messages. First he said he deleted them bc of storage, but when I told him he could go into recently deleted he took his phone out of my hand and deleted them out of there. This caused a huge fight and he came back with his laptop showing me the messages. She had told him her Halloween costume was sexy etc. but the messages did not add up to the 64 “recently deleted” messages. Eventually he told me he texted her he was sorry for leading her on.

When we got back together after ~4 months, I found out that he had been communicating with his ex’s mother the entire relationship. She asks him how he is, wishes him happy birthday and merry Christmas and thanksgiving and Easter and happy graduation and sent him his ex’s graduation photos….

I don’t like this. I’ve looked up similar posts and people say the the OP is overreacting and jealous.. and I’m thinking, yeah, maybe, fair enough, I need to chill. But I’m tired of how all my “chill” moments have resulted in the past! 

He’s ignored some of her messages and responds with “thanks!!” And sometimes I don’t have to nag him about letting me know when they communicate.

I don’t even know how I feel about this bc he says she’s a family friend that he doesn’t want to be rude to, but I feel so disrespected when it comes to this ex and her family.

Please someone give me advice and tell me what to do

Also have a history of chronic constipation (probably due to lifestyle - not enough fiber/water/exercise, but my mother does have slow motility). I went to the doctor and had upper right quadrant ultrasound and HIDA scan to check for gallbladder issues. I do have stones but the GI doctor said it's likely not the cause of my discomfort as the HIDA scan was normal and the symptoms didn't quite align, so we discussed IBS-C. Since then I've been trying to follow low FODMAP diet (but only really got serious/strict about 2 weeks ago). 

I switched from drinking diet drinks (tea, pop) to essentially just water throughout the day and a coffee with oat milk in the morning. I've also been trying to eat mainly whole foods that are low FODMAP (lots of chicken, steamed veggies) and eliminate processed foods from my diet. I've lost 6 pounds in a little over a week. Can this be normal? 

It's always been a huge struggle for me to lose weight, so to see it come off so quickly is very concerning to me, especially since I have a family history of colon cancer (grandfather).

No I don't want to learn to use my machine using hieroglyphs with no text. The actual manual with text on it only explains the bare bones of starting the machine up for the first time and maintaining it, but contains nothing about making drinks, configuring the machine's settings or loading coffee.

The way you adjust the settings on these machines isn't the most intuitive process, which I wouldn't mind if they would actually explain how to do it. The only explanation is in the graphic-only quick start guide which tries to explain every step from unboxing the machine to making your first coffee in a series of unlabeled difficult to follow graphics, with the hope that people from all cultures will be able to understand them with no need to ship actual instructions in multiple languages. You'd never figure out how to do a few key things without watching videos online. And that graphical quick start guide also fails to mention the need to make a few cups before drinking them.

Between the manual and the quick start guide I'd say there's around 60% of an explanation of how to use it, and it really wouldn't take much extra text in the written manual to make that 90%.

# URGENT: Mom crushing Venlafaxine capsules and mixing with coffee - Severe side effects. What do I do?



Hey Reddit,

I'm in a really difficult and scary situation with my 57-year-old mother. She's taking Venlafaxine, but instead of taking the capsules as prescribed, she's been crushing them and mixing them into her coffee.

She's now experiencing what seem like very strong side effects or unexpected reactions. I'm incredibly worried.

The biggest problem is, she's **absolutely unwilling to go to a doctor or a hospital**, no matter how much I plead.

**My questions are:**

* Has anyone ever heard of this or experienced something similar when Venlafaxine capsules are crushed and taken this way?
* What kind of ""wrong"" effects or side effects could this cause?
* **Most importantly: What can I do?** Given her refusal to seek professional medical help, I feel completely stuck and desperate.

Any advice or insights on how to handle this critical situation would be deeply appreciated. I'm really concerned for her health and safety.",1,1752664851.0,Effexor,6,1.0,False

The Defense Department last week agreed to buy a direct equity stake in [MP Materials](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MP/), which will make the U.S. government the miner’s [largest shareholder](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html). MP operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S. located at Mountain Pass, California, and a magnet plant in Fort Worth, Texas.

When asked whether the Pentagon is considering similar investments in other U.S. mining companies, the defense official said it is looking at opportunities to strengthen domestic critical mineral production.

“Rebuilding the critical minerals and rare earth magnet sectors of the U.S. industrial base won’t happen overnight, but DoD is taking immediate action to streamline processes and identify opportunities to strengthen critical minerals production,” official said in a statement.

Rare earths are used in weapons such as the F-35 warplane, drones and submarines among other other military platforms. The U.S. was almost entirely dependent on foreign countries for rare earths in 2023, with China representing about 70% of imports, according to the [U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf).

MP Materials CEO James Litinsky told CNBC last week that he views the public-private partnership with the Defense Department as a model for other companies in industries that are important for national security but struggle to compete against the state-backed enterprises in China.

“I’d like to think that this is sort of the first, it’s a model,” Litinsky told CNBC’s “[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/)” on Thursday. “We have to deliver at MP and show that this is an incredible route to go. But it’s a new way forward to accelerate free markets, to get the supply chain on shore that we want.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in April that the U.S. government was looking at taking direct equity stakes in critical mineral and rare earth miners to break China’s dominance. The Trump administration is also looking at stockpiling critical minerals and creating a sovereign risk insurance fund to protect companies investments’ in federally approved projects, [Burgum said](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/trump-weighs-investments-in-critical-mineral-companies-burgum-says.html) at an energy conference in Oklahoma City.

The Pentagon makes long-term investments in mining, processing and refining critical minerals, the defense official told CNBC. It has invested $540 million so far to support a critical mineral and rare earth supply chain in the U.S. and allied nations, the official said.

***“That is significant, and DoD will continue to such efforts in accordance with congressional appropriations and statutory authorities,” the official said.***

July 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense plans to continue investing in critical minerals projects to ensure a diverse American supply of the building blocks for weapons and many electronics, a defense official told Reuters on Tuesday. The Pentagon signed a [multibillion-dollar deal](https://www.reuters.com/business/mp-materials-partners-with-department-defense-boost-us-rare-earth-magnet-supply-2025-07-10/) last week to become the largest shareholder in rare earths producer MP Materials [(MP.N), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MP.N) and also agreed to several financial backstop measures for the company.

The move - which the defense official said reflected a desire to ""share the risk"" inherent in minerals projects - sparked questions across the mining sector about whether other companies could see similar investments from the U.S. military. ***The Pentagon has invested almost $540 million into critical minerals projects and ""will continue such efforts in accordance with congressional appropriations and statutory authorities,"" the official said. ""Rebuilding the critical minerals and rare earth magnet sectors of the U.S. industrial base won't happen overnight, but (the Pentagon) is taking immediate action to streamline processes and identify opportunities to strengthen critical minerals production,"" the official added.***

***The U.S. government and military recognize that the country no longer can produce or process many critical minerals, but plans to ""take the necessary time and precautions to produce critical minerals and associated products in a safe and responsible fashion,"" the official said, adding that approach was unlike China's.***

The MP deal structure reflects a ""unique approach"" by the U.S. government to ""account for the difficulties in establishing and sustaining production of critical rare earth magnets in a market environment in which China controls much of the supply chain,"" the official said. The Pentagon investment in MP was undertaken via a Cold War-era law known as the Defense Production Act, as well as its Office of Strategic Capital, the official said.***

# MARCH 2024~ Hypersonic Hegemony: Niobium and the Western Hemisphere’s Role in the U.S.-China Power Struggle

[Hypersonic Hegemony: Niobium and the Western Hemisphere’s Role in the U.S.-China Power Struggle](https://www.csis.org/analysis/hypersonic-hegemony-niobium-and-western-hemispheres-role-us-china-power-struggle)

https://preview.redd.it/042dbzblo7df1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef53ebe8ecea8d5f0abd070fc47a9c80beb9fe43

# Introduction

In the evolving landscape of global defense, the arms race has metamorphosed from a contest of nuclear might to one of unparalleled speed. [Hypersonic weapons](https://www.csis.org/analysis/complex-air-defense-countering-hypersonic-missile-threat) (capable of exceeding [five times the speed of sound](https://www.domailleengineering.com/niobium-c103-unique-hypersonics/)), promise to revolutionize modern warfare.

China's strides in the hypersonic field are a manifestation of its broader strategic intentions and underscore its drive toward technological and military preeminence. This journey toward mastering hypersonic technology is not merely for show; it is about redefining the global balance of military power.

A successful deployment of these weapons would enable China to redefine the term “first-strike advantage.” Such a capability is not merely about striking first; it is about striking in a manner that leaves the opponent minimal time or capacity to react, effectively nullifying their defensive postures. This introduces a dangerous paradigm wherein the traditional cushion of time provided by early warning systems is drastically reduced. For the United States, this might mean that even with the world's most advanced detection systems, the [window to act](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45811/35) could be so minimal that it might be rendered ineffective. As the United States and China jostle for dominance in this arena, the strategic significance of an elemental material, niobium, emerges as a pivotal concern, and with it, China’s rising dominance in the Western Hemisphere’s mining sector.

# Niobium: The Aerospace Marvel

Vacuum-grade niobium’s [role](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/) in aerospace is not a newfound revelation. Its unparalleled resilience against extreme thermal stresses, withstanding temperatures [over 2,400 degrees Celsius,](https://www.domailleengineering.com/niobium-c103-unique-hypersonics/) renders it indispensable for critical components in hypersonic vehicles. Beyond its inherent properties, niobium’s pivotal role lies in its use for crafting heat-resistant superalloys essential for hypersonic missiles and the broader aerospace sector. Its low density compared to other refractory metals contributes to a [high strength-to-weight ratio](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/), which is essential for reducing the weight of aerospace components. This reduction in weight directly impacts fuel efficiency and payload capacity, two critical factors in aerospace design. For example, companies like [SpaceX and Hermeus](https://payloadspace.com/unlocking-the-potential-of-niobium-c103-a-game-changing-material-for-the-space-industry/) depend on niobium C103 for their spacecrafts, which require extremely high temperatures that surpass that of other superalloys.

For decades, niobium has played a pivotal role in the U.S. aerospace industry, with its notable use in the innovative designs of the iconic [Gemini and Apollo](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Apollo-15-CSM-in-lunar-orbit-with-the-dark-rocket-nozzle-made-from-niobium-titanium_fig1_329104474) programs of the 1960s and 70s. However, despite its significance, the United States depends entirely on niobium imports, with no substantial domestic mining since [1959](https://minedocs.com/19/USGS-Mineral-Commodity-Summaries-Niobium-January-2022.pdf). This reliance introduces a severe risk to its supply chain. Of the estimated [8,800 metric tons](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/) imported annually in 2022, a significant majority comes from [Brazil (66 percent) and Canada (25 percent)](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/references/strategic-materials/). This heavy reliance on just two primary sources—both neighbors of the United States in the Western Hemisphere—exposes the United States to considerable national security and economic vulnerabilities. The situation becomes even more precarious considering China’s dominant position in the niobium sector and its growing footprint in the hemisphere.

# China’s Stake in Brazil’s Mineral Monopoly

Brazil dominated global niobium production in 2020, accounting for over [91 percent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316) of production. With reserves estimated at [842 million metric tons](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/), Brazil produces roughly [120,000 metric tons annually](https://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/the-niobium-controversy-2/). Brazil’s high production comes from large mines such as [Araxá and Catalão](https://www.cradleresources.com.au/what-is-niobium/), with Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração (CBMM) controlling [75 percent of Brazil’s output](https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/).

China has recognized the potential of niobium for over a decade. In 2011, a consortium of [five Chinese companies](https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/) acquired a 15 percent stake in CBMM. This engagement intensified in 2016 when China Molybdenum Co. Ltd. (now known only as CMOC) secured ownership of the [Chapadão and Boa Vista mines](https://dialogochino.net/en/extractive-industries/25588-niobiums-silent-impact-in-brazil/), further strengthening China's position in the niobium market.

The importance of niobium was further highlighted in the Brazilian political arena in 2018. Then presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro emphasized niobium's role in Brazil's “[economic independence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-election-china-niobium/hands-off-brazils-niobium-bolsonaro-sees-china-as-threat-to-utopian-vision-idUSKCN1MZ1JN/).” Despite Bolsonaro's campaign rhetoric focusing on safeguarding this critical commodity from foreign control and advocating for its national governance, Chinese influence in the Brazilian niobium sector continued to grow. By 2020, Chinese entities controlled approximately [26 percent of Brazil's niobium production](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316). This control not only ensures China's preferential access and influence over pricing dynamics in the niobium supply chain, but also positions it advantageously in a global context.

China managed to maintain and even strengthen its position at the subnational level under Bolsonaro. CMOC for instance provided [$1.2 million](https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/04/brazils-economic-ties-china-flourish-despite-political-shifts) in Covid-19 aid to the city of Catalão, demonstrating China's strategic engagement beyond mere commercial interests.

China’s influence over Brazil’s niobium production conforms to a [pattern](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2023/07/chinas-critical-mineral-model-latin-america/) of growing ownership and sway over the regional mining industry, a trend with substantial environmental, political, and security implications. Such tactics could force nations into making diplomatic compromises, ceding trade advantages, or grappling with economic dilemmas, thereby solidifying China's geopolitical standing. The United States is not immune to this exposure; in 2022 the U.S. Geological Survey identified niobium as the [second most critical of 50 minerals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344922005316#bib0072), falling behind only gallium in its criticality to U.S. national security and economic growth.

# Defense Implications

China's hypersonic resolve has been remarkable. By 2018, it had [conducted over 20 times](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/R45811.pdf) as many tests as the United States. According to the Pentagon, the United States is [still lagging.](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2023/04/18/pentagon-yes-we-are-still-lagging-behind-chinas-hypersonics/) This hypersonic prowess, combined with China's stranglehold on niobium, places the United States in a perilous position.

The strategic importance of niobium in next-generation defense systems cannot be overstated. As the U.S. military and its defense contractors increasingly rely on niobium-based superalloys to produce a wide range of equipment, from aircraft components to hypersonic missile systems, any disruption in the niobium supply chain could have significant repercussions.

Overall, China's growing influence and control over critical mineral supply chains poses a distinct challenge. Under the Biden administration, the United States and the European Union placed export controls and restrictions on strategic and critical minerals to curb China’s dominance in [artificial intelligence and semiconductors](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/what-to-make-of-chinas-latest-restrictions-on-critical-mineral-exports/). In retaliation, China imposed their own limitations on [gallium, germanium](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-flexes-critical-metals-muscles-with-export-curbs-2023-07-10/), and [graphite](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-require-export-permits-some-graphite-products-dec-1-2023-10-20/) throughout 2023. A recent analysis by [CSIS](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-graphite-restrictions#:~:text=China%20produces%2090%20percent%20of,90%20percent%20of%20global%20graphite.) highlighted that China controls 90 percent of global gallium supplies, 90 percent of graphite, and 60 percent of germanium, all critical to the production of chips and electric vehicle batteries. The critical mineral supply chain has arrived at the forefront of strategic competition between the West and the People’s Republic of China.

China’s grip on the production, distribution, and pricing of niobium presents another layer of complexity: manipulating niobium’s availability to other nations. For the United States, already grappling with the challenges of overdependence on external sources for critical minerals, such a disruption could translate into significant production delays. The consequences could be serious: slower production of critical defense equipment, increased costs due to the potential need for alternative materials, and a cascading effect on existing machinery's maintenance and upgrade cycles. In this highly complex environment where timely responses to emerging threats are vital, these delays could hinder the United States' ability to promptly deploy or develop necessary defense systems.

# U.S. Countermeasures

Facing such formidable challenges, the United States cannot afford to remain a passive observer. Safeguarding its strategic interests and maintaining its global position demands a comprehensive and multifaceted critical mineral strategy, particularly in securing niobium supplies.

**Including Brazil in the MSP**

Incorporating Brazil into the 13-nation [Mineral Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership/) (MSP) could significantly fortify the global niobium supply chain. The MSP represents a concerted multinational endeavor to develop environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards and bolster investments in critical mineral supply chains, an initiative that aligns well with the strategic interests of both Brazil and the broader international community. Brazil’s inclusion would make it the first Latin American country to enter the partnership, signaling its regional leadership and increase in international stature. The integration of Brazil into this partnership is particularly strategic, considering its substantial niobium reserves, in addition to its other critical mineral deposits. This move would add a robust layer of security against potential supply disruptions.

President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration, with its strong emphasis on ESG standards, is likely to find the MSP's principles congruent with its [policy priorities](https://dialogochino.net/en/climate-energy/363907-will-lula-be-brazils-environmental-saviour/). The MSP’s emphasis on elevating global standards in these areas could resonate with Lula’s progressive agenda, potentially making Brazil’s participation both beneficial and attractive.

Furthermore, Brazil's inclusion in the MSP would facilitate its adherence to a framework that advocates for the diversification and stabilization of mineral supply chains. This alignment could be instrumental in mitigating China’s dominant influence in the niobium market. By joining the MSP, Brazil would not only assert its role in the global mineral economy but also contribute to a more balanced and less vulnerable critical mineral supply landscape, including niobium.

**Diversification of Niobium Sources**

Diversifying niobium sources is a critical strategic concern. The current overreliance on a limited number of suppliers presents a significant vulnerability in the supply chain. This is not merely a matter of economic convenience but a pressing national security issue.

 ***The*** [***Elk Creek project***](https://www.usgs.gov/data/niobium-deposits-united-states) ***in Nebraska represents a commendable step toward addressing this vulnerability domestically. This initiative exemplifies how investment in local resources can contribute to a more resilient supply chain. Placing more emphasis on domestic production, the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act*** [***calls for domestic manufacturing of critical minerals***](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/whats-in-the-fy2024-ndaa-for-critical-minerals/)***, and “encourages DOD to review the need to utilize Defense Production Act authorities to establish domestic processing capacity of niobium, tantalum, and scandium.”***

However, to comprehensively mitigate the risks associated with niobium supply, the United States should extend its strategy beyond domestic projects. Engaging in international partnerships, especially with Canadian, African, and European nations that have niobium reserves, is crucial.

Canada’s significant niobium reserves stands as an ideal partner to strengthen North American supply security. The geographical proximity of Canada to the United States offers logistical advantages, reducing transportation costs and environmental impact. Additionally, the strong political and economic ties between the United States and Canada could facilitate smoother bilateral agreements and joint ventures in niobium exploration and development.

Africa’s rich mineral resources, and Europe’s advanced mining technologies and regulatory frameworks, offer promising avenues for collaboration. These partnerships could lead to the exploration and development of new niobium sources, thus diversifying the global supply chain.

**Stockpiling and Strategic Reserves**

The practice of stockpiling and maintaining strategic reserves of strategic minerals serves as a crucial safeguard during times of geopolitical unrest or supply chain interruptions. Experts suggest that with its existing reserves of critical minerals, the United States may [face challenges in sustaining](https://warontherocks.com/2023/09/the-u-s-government-should-stockpile-more-critical-minerals/) a protracted conflict with China. The National Defense Stockpile (NDS), designed to support the nation's needs for up to [four years](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833), is perceived by some as insufficient for the United States to execute its strategic military objectives effectively. Proactive measures to accumulate substantial reserves of niobium and other strategic minerals are imperative. While in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 Congress appropriated [$218.5 million](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47833) for total NDS acquisitions, it remains at an unsatisfactory level to support the nation’s needs. Congress should place more effort in supporting the NDS in the future. Strategic stockpiling must be revitalized to Cold War-era levels so that the United States maintains its capability to meet both economic and defense production demands, even under challenging global scenarios.

# Conclusion

***In the grand chessboard of defense geopolitics, niobium has emerged as a piece of paramount importance. The intertwining of mineral control and technological advancements underscores the multifaceted nature of modern security threats. For the United States, addressing this dual challenge is not just about catching up in the hypersonic race or diversifying niobium sources, but about reimagining its strategic approach in a complex global landscape—one where the Western Hemisphere takes center stage. Recognizing and mitigating these vulnerabilities will be crucial in ensuring U.S. national security in the face of strategic competition. The stakes are high, and the game is evolving; proactive measures today will dictate the balance of power tomorrow.***

I have 2 questions regarding my Lelit Anna pl41tem machine. 

1. I have recently discovered long blacks, where I first have hot water come into my coffee cup followed by an espresso on top of that hot water. Now whenever I have the hot water go to my cup, the temp on the boiler drops to say 88 degrees. Then I set the machine back to coffee mode and the boiler heats up again, but overshoots the 95 degree setting I have for coffee and goes to 102 or so. I then have to have some hot water release again to bring the temp down to a good temp for espresso. Is there a way to avoid the overshoot and thus the extra step in the process?
2. If I don't pay close attention to attaching the portafilter, water pours out the side when brewing. However, if I put it in place securely, the portafilter goes quite far to the right rather than perpendicular to the machine. In the beginning I was able to reach a 'locked' position with the portafilter being much more 'in the middle'. Any ideas what might be causing this?

That’s where getting your surfaces[ **Scotch Guarded** ](https://majesticcarpetcleaning.ca/scotch-details.html)comes in. Scotchgard is a powerful stain and water repellent applied to upholstery, carpets, rugs, and fabrics to protect them from everyday mishaps.

https://preview.redd.it/jnt2k05bz7df1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=694b1a4fd295957d53e550cb9e8da87097280564

In this article, we’ll explore why Scotchgard treatment is worth the investment and how it can significantly extend the life of your furnishings. From homes with kids and pets to high-traffic office environments, applying Scotchgard offers a protective layer that makes cleaning easier and prevents permanent stains from setting in.



**What Is Scotchgard?**

Once applied, it forms an invisible shield on the surface of textiles that repels liquids and blocks dirt and oils from penetrating deep into the fibers. Instead of absorbing spills, treated fabrics allow you to blot and clean up messes easily, giving you more time to react before a stain sets in.

https://preview.redd.it/snk417hcz7df1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=95f5973e8cbca4d18133497fdf68dc92b8c8b955



**Benefits of Scotchgard Protection**

1. **Stain Resistance:**
2. The primary benefit of Scotchgard is its ability to prevent stains. Coffee, wine, juice, and even pet accidents are less likely to leave a mark on Scotch Guarded surfaces
3. **Easier Cleaning:**
4. Since liquids and dirt sit on the surface, cleanup is far simpler. You won’t have to scrub or soak to remove messes.
5. **Prolongs Lifespan of Fabrics:**
6. Dirt and grime can wear down [**upholstery carpet**](https://majesticcarpetcleaning.ca/upholstry-cleaning-details.html) fibers over time. Scotchgard minimizes this wear, keeping your items in better condition for longer.
7. **Preserves Appearance:**
8. Your furniture and carpets will maintain their original color and look since the protective layer keeps contaminants from dulling the fabric.

**Where Can You Apply Scotchgard?**

* Upholstered furniture (sofas, armchairs, dining chairs)
* Carpets and area rugs
* Car interiors
* Fabric drapes and curtains
* Mattresses and pillows

It’s especially recommended for high-use areas or for homes with children and pets where accidental spills are more common.

**When Should You Apply Scotchgard?**

It’s best to apply Scotchgard immediately after a deep cleaning service. This ensures that the product adheres to clean fibers and offers the most effective protection. After professional carpet or upholstery cleaning, your technician can apply Scotchgard as an added service.



**How Long Does Scotchgard Last?**

Scotchgard protection isn’t permanent. Its effectiveness diminishes with time, cleaning, and use. Most experts recommend reapplying every 6–12 months, depending on how frequently the surface is used. For instance, a living room sofa may need more frequent reapplication than a guest room chair.



**Is Scotchgard Safe?**

Yes, modern formulations of Scotchgard are safe for use around children and pets when applied according to manufacturer guidelines. It’s always best to ventilate the area during application and allow it to dry completely before use.



**DIY vs. Professional Application**

You can buy Scotchgard in spray cans at many retailers, but professional application is often more thorough and long-lasting. Professionals use high-grade versions and apply them evenly across all surfaces.

**Final Thoughts**

Scotch Guarded furniture and carpets are easier to maintain, look better, and last longer. Whether you’re protecting a new investment or maintaining a cherished piece, adding Scotchgard to your cleaning routine is a smart and cost-effective decision. It adds peace of mind knowing that everyday spills and stains won’t become permanent problems.

For the best results, consider having your Scotchgard treatment done by a reputable cleaning service that offers this option. Not only will they ensure the proper application, but they’ll also advise you on the best care practices to extend your protection.

Also have a history of chronic constipation (probably due to lifestyle - not enough fiber/water/exercise, but my mother does have slow motility). I went to the doctor and had upper right quadrant ultrasound and HIDA scan to check for gallbladder issues. I do have stones but the GI doctor said it's likely not the cause of my discomfort as the HIDA scan was normal and the symptoms didn't quite align, so we discussed IBS-C. Since then I've been trying to follow low FODMAP diet (but only really got serious/strict about 2 weeks ago). 

I switched from drinking diet drinks (tea, pop) to essentially just water and a coffee with oat milk in the morning. I've also been trying to eat only whole foods that are low FODMAP (lots of chicken, steamed veggies). I've lost 6 pounds in a little over a week. Can this be normal? 

It's always been a huge struggle for me to lose weight, so to see it come off so quickly is very concerning to me. I have an appointment for a colonoscopy and abdominal/pelvic CT coming up in a few weeks but I can't help but panic that this could be something worse. ",2,1752664525.0,ibs,1,1.0,False

Himalaya baby powder - I found this to be not as finely milled as the Johnson’s baby powder; nonetheless, it’s a good product 

Mcaffeine Coffee Body Scrub - Hands down, the best physical exfoliator. It comes in a powder form - very gritty and scrubs the body well 🧁

Nivea berry blossom soft creme - Formula similar to original soft creme, but this berry variant wasn’t for me, didn’t like the fragrance 

BABW Freshwater body cream - I dreaded using this so much; I hate the scent. Although the product hasn’t expired, the consistency has fallen off. I did my fair share of research and found that the BABW body cream formula goes bad quickly, saw a lot of US creators talk about it as well. I’m going to stick to babw body lotions only

Candid powder - always have one in my collection, helps with itchy, irritated skin 

BABW Freshwater shower gel - if you come home exhausted from work/workout/college, or just a heavy day, this one is the best pick. Super refreshing and calming, and it lathers so nicely

Minimalist Glycolic acid - used it on my body and underarms, helps with odour and sweat control, can’t say anything about skin lightening though 

Dove Go Fresh Deo - the GOAT! My favourite deo, I'm sad they don’t make this in the roll-on form anymore, if Dove ends up stocking this, I will buy a backup 🧁

Gillette Venus Razor - good razor, I currently have the carmesi set

Himalaya Nourishing Cream - smells so nice, very subtle fragrance, really liked it, plus it’s a thick cream, so you need a very small amount 

TonyMoly peeling liquid - got 2 of these for my mom and me for a pamper session. If you don’t spend money in salons for a pedicure or get a professional clean-up by dermatologists/aestheticians, then this is an affordable option

then he texted asking coffee venuma? so i said why suddenly, and he said he wanted indian coffee but it was only sharing version so he asked if i wanted some. i said yeah sure bc i love coffee. vanthathuku apram he took my coffee flask and poured it so nicely and said have a nice drink maam in a cute way. i laughed and drank, said it was nice and it woke me up a little (coffee is the best dude). he laughed and said it was coz he poured it with a lot of appreciation for me. 

i am so confused with this man!!!!!!!!

anyways im not gonna make the first move. and im def not gonna ask him out because im too shy HAHA",9,1752663738.0,TamilTwenties,19,1.0,False

I swear, the mental fatigue from crunch time just amplifies the usual driving fatigue tenfold. It's like my brain is so fried from staring at spreadsheets all day that I'm barely functioning behind the wheel.

I've started making sure to pull over for a coffee or even just a few minutes of mindful breathing before heading home, but it only helps so much. The sheer weight of unfinished tasks and looming deadlines follows me right into the car. I'm constantly replaying scenarios in my head, worrying about missing something, and it makes it unfeasible to focus on the road.

Anyone got tips for dealing with this specific brand of exhausted-deadline-induced driving daze? Is it just me, or is this a widespread problem in high-pressure jobs? Maybe some after-work routines that help reset the brain before getting behind the wheel? It feels like a safety issue, and I'm really trying to figure out how to manage it better.",1,1752663651.0,WheelsAndWanderlust,0,1.0,False

I’m heading off to the Netherlands next month for my Master’s, and before I go, I want to stitch some shirts with good-quality, affordable fabric surplus, rejected, off-the-rack, homegrown, whatever works (as long as it looks fly). I've done shopping across the country now and i feel like I'd be doing injustice if i didn't look for these in my own hometown 

Now, I’ve lived in Bombay and Bangalore seen my fair share of garment surplus stores and what I have realized is Vizag’s no small fish either. With the kind of logistics we’ve got there has to be a goldmine of branded surplus or export rejects somewhere here, right?

Also, minor flex: Araku coffee (yes, from our Araku) has a store in Paris now. So I figured… if our beans can go global, why not a few threads too? 

Help your boi to represent Vizag on the Map and especially in the west. It's highttime Those Chic boho audience gotta be schooled about our Hometown

I accidentally left my Kindle at COSI Hotel in Chaweng, and I’m currently in Phuket for the next 4 days and then Bangkok from the 20th to the 22nd.

COSI has confirmed they have the Kindle and are happy to hand it over to someone on my behalf. I was wondering if any kind soul might be:

•	Heading from Samui to Phuket before the 20th, or

•	Traveling to Bangkok between the 20th–22nd,
and wouldn’t mind picking it up and bringing it along?

I’d be super grateful and happy to buy you a coffee/beer/meal as thanks! 🙏

1m19j3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m19j3g/noise_cancellation/,Noise Cancellation,"I loved to be around the wires. They were always reliable and never had to be recharged. The only issue with them was the wire’s life. If there was any problem, you had to buy another. But wired stuff was cheaper.

But for the first time, I tried Bluetooth earbuds — noise-cancelling ones. I was very excited to use them.

I put the earbud in my ear and waited for the silence to cover me.

It was fabulous. I couldn’t hear a thing — the fan, the washing machine — nothing at all. It was just perfect for me. I started doing my office work while using the earbuds in my ears and maybe some songs in the background.

The office colleagues were tired of me and my new habit of listening to music while working because they literally had to walk to me to say something.

One morning, I woke up late and decided to work from home. Work from home is perfect, but the only issue is that there’s no login time and logoff time, no tea break or lunch break. You end up working the whole day and might get overwhelmed.

I was sitting on the chair, and my laptop was on the table in front of me. My room light bulb was just above me, giving me no shadows to get distracted.

I put the earbuds in my ears and started listening to music while working on the code.

There were many things on my desk — my laptop, AC remote, my Iron Man figures, and some books. So basically, the whole desk was full. I loved playing with the Iron Man figures in between my work. They were kind of my stress busters.

While working, I felt a cold spot near my neck. I ignored it and continued working. But again, the same kind of cold spot hit my neck. I took the AC remote and turned it off.

After some time, the room began to feel warmer.  
The cold spots were gone.  
I glanced at the clock on my laptop screen — it was a little past 10 PM.  
Time for dinner.

I made chapatis and some chickpeas for myself.  
When I walked into the kitchen, a strange, foul smell hit me.  
I covered my nose and looked around to find where it was coming from.  
Nothing.  
I sprayed some air freshener and took a deep breath.  
The smell was gone — at least in the kitchen.

I looked at my plate. It was covered with another plate. I walked to it, the smell was in the air, and a smile on my face. I uncovered the plate.

It was empty.

“I… I remember that I served my food.”

I looked around. I checked the fridge, I checked my oven, and everywhere else. But the food was nowhere.

“Did I not cook today?” I asked myself. “Maybe I was too busy and just thought that I cooked?”

I shrugged off the thoughts and ordered food online.

The foul smell still covered the house. I had to spray the room freshener multiple times.

The sun rose again. It lit up my room. I slowly opened my eyes and grabbed my phone. The screen flashed the time. I was late again. So I decided to work from home once again.

The day went by with me listening to music and doing work. But because of a sudden lot of work pressure, I had to work till late night.

That day, again, I was working late. I had a cup of coffee to keep myself awake and avoid sleeping.

After some time, I walked to my chair. After a deep sigh, I descended into the seat. To my surprise, the armrest was already warm.

“I left the chair a while ago… It should be cold.” I looked at my AC; it was on. I unlocked the screen, letting the colors reflect in my eyes.

I put my earbuds back in my ears and played the loud music.

While my fingers were clicking on the keyboard, I again felt the cold spots. As before, I turned off the AC and waited for the warmth. But for some reason, my body turned warmer, yet my neck was still cold. A cold breeze kept touching my neck.

Without turning, I placed my hand on my neck. A chill ran down my spine. I felt breathing on my hand. It was like someone was standing there and breathing.

I took a deep breath and turned.

There was no one.

The whole room was empty.

I turned my head around to check for anyone hiding. But there was no one. I was all alone in my room — I was alone at that moment only. Because there were muddy footprints on the floor. I followed them.

The footprints came into the house from the main door, which was locked from the inside. I always lock it. But the footprints came in and walked to my room. It seemed someone was standing behind me, and there were no footprints showing them leaving.

“Someone is in the house…” I said in a shaky voice.

I grabbed my phone, locked my bedroom from outside, and called the police.

“We are coming in 15 minutes. Please stay hidden,” they said.

I was standing in the hall. Without any protection. I didn’t know where to hide. I wasn’t even sure where that intruder was. He could be anywhere — he could be in my bedroom, which I locked; he could be in the kitchen, bathroom — anywhere.

I slowly kept walking towards the main door.

“If he is in the house, standing out in the public might be a good idea,” I thought.

I unlocked the door and stepped out. My hand was still holding the door knob, ready to close the door. I was facing outside, and my back was toward the house.

I heard someone rushing towards me — someone was running.

Without looking, I closed the door and locked it from outside. Whoever was inside started knocking.

“Open the door and let me out\~” the voice came.

He wasn’t begging. He was not scared. He was humming while knocking on the door.

My teary eyes were fixed on the door. With my shaky breath, I walked back. I tried to be near the road as much as possible without getting knocked by the cars. I was ready to run if something happened.

The knocking continued.

I stood near the road, shaking. Suddenly, the knocking stopped. A shadow emerged near the window. Someone was walking towards the window. I prepared myself. Suddenly, the shadow stopped. It didn’t appear in front of the window but stayed there.

The police arrived.

I pointed toward the window and gave them the keys to my house. With guns in their hands, all five officers walked in.

I saw them separating into three groups — one leading to the kitchen, another towards the bedroom, and the last one entering the living room. The shadow was still there, at the window. But the officers didn’t notice.

I walked into the house slowly. I turned toward the window.

There was a night lamp standing 5 feet 8 inches tall and casting a shadow on the wall behind it.

“The house is clear,” the officers said. After writing the report, they left.

I was standing alone in the house. Scared.

I went into the bedroom. The laptop was still on the desk with all my other stuff. I slowly sat on the chair, which again was warm. I was a bit confident because the officer confirmed that there was no one in the house.

I locked the doors and locked my bedroom door as well. I left the lights on while I decided to sleep. For a few hours, my eyes were wide open. I was unable to sleep.

After some time, my eyes decided to rest.

I closed my eyes, falling asleep. The fan kept blowing air. The blow was faster for some reason. I slept peacefully. I avoided thinking about anything and just let the airflow on my face.

The sunlight hit my eyes. I woke up. I grabbed my phone and checked the time. I was on time. But I decided to work from home once again. I left the bed and went to the washroom to get fresh.

After getting fresh, I returned to my bed and noticed some stains on my bed sheet. I looked closely — they weren’t fresh. But they weren’t there the night before when I decided to sleep.

I pulled the bed sheet and put it in the washing machine.

I had to start work. I turned on my laptop and started working. After some time, when the whole house was echoing with the washing machine’s sound and the noise of vehicles from outside, I decided to put the earbuds in my ears again.

In the infinite silence, I kept on working. The sun was still in the sky. I was staring at the laptop screen, going through the report.

The cold spot hit my neck once again. With my eyes still on the laptop, I picked up the AC remote and clicked the “turn on/off” button. The AC gave out a small jingle. My eyes shifted toward it. The sound was of the AC turning on.

My jaw dropped. I was still feeling cold blows on my neck. With a shivering body, I slowly turned back. The cold blow faded. There was nothing behind me.

I returned to my laptop. My eyes were on the screen, but my brain was still trying to process it. My hands were still trembling. I started scrolling through the report while still thinking about the cold spots.

I felt them again — this time on my neck and shoulder. I looked up toward the AC — it was on. I tried to ignore the cold air and continued my work.

After some time, because of continuous earbud use, my ears started aching. I decided to take them out for a while. My hands moved toward my ears, passing through the cold air blowing on my neck, and I slowly took out the earbuds.

My body froze in shock. I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t. I wanted to run, but my body didn’t move. Without the earbuds, I could hear the breathing behind me. Someone was near my right ear, breathing hard.

My heart started racing.

Two cold hands touched my hands from behind and guided them to put the earbuds back into my ears.

I jumped from my seat and turned back.

The cold blow stopped. There were many footprints on the floor. This time, they were leaving my room. I gathered my courage and slowly followed them.

The footprints were all over the house, followed by a severe foul smell. I closed my nose with one hand and clenched a fist with the other, prepared for anything.

The footprints ended at the main door again.  
That day someone entered the house.  
And now, someone left the house.

I stood there, staring at the footprints.  
Cold air brushed the back of my neck.  
I could hear someone breathing behind me.  
The earbuds were still in my ears — noise cancellation was off.  
And then, without me touching them…  
It turned on.  
Silence.  
Total silence.  
But the breath…  
it was still there.

Do you ever feel… the breath? When you put on those noise-cancelling earbuds… like something else is listening too?",1,1752663436.0,nosleep,0,0.6,False

Second time was at the movie theaters. I got a kid’s size soda, and had to literally storm out mid movie to take the worst diarrhea of my life. The thing is I had gotten a kid’s size icee at the movie theater before and had no physical reaction to it. I also occasionally get a fruity tea or sweetened coffee, even after I got diagnosed. 
(Before anyone judges me, I have successfully lowered my A1C in the past few months so don’t get on me for having certain sweets lol). 
I guess I’m just curious what makes soda different? Is it really that much more sugar than everything else, or is there a specific ingredient that I don’t know about?? Or is my body just not used to it anymore?",2,1752663114.0,diabetes,2,0.75,False
1m19eig,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m19eig/my_24f_fiancées_28f_brother_and_his_wife_have/,My (24F) fiancée’s (28F) brother and his wife have been treating us awfully and I'm fed up,"After years of emotional neglect, boundary-stomping, and hypocritical disrespect, my fiancée is finally seeing what I’ve seen all along.

We’ve been together and living together for 4 years. We’re extremely close, moved in together out of necessity, and it ended up being the best thing that ever happened to us. Her brother (30M) and his wife were ""supportive"" early on, but it was always conditional. We’d constantly accommodate them, plan around their lives, and cater to their moods, even when we were struggling mentally. On the surface things looked okay, but now we see how one-sided it was.

In these 4 years, they got married, moved abroad, had a kid - and slowly became colder and more dismissive. A year ago, we a
went on vacation together with another couple and it turned into a disaster. They were disrespectful, drunk, lazy all the time. We wanted to explore and have fun, they resented us for it. One night, one person exploded at my fiancée with bizarre lies and pent-up resentment. I (normally very calm) snapped and stood up for her. Her brother wasn’t there when it happened, and when he heard about it, he said, “I just care about eating good on vacation,” and refused to get involved. That moment told us everything.

They also went through our private belongings in the airbnb. Never admitted it. Just started being creepily sweet afterward, like they always do when they know they crossed a line. Apologies were either half-assed or avoided entirely. We got home and things were never the same.

Since then, they’ve pushed us out more and more. Didn’t invite us to see the baby for six months - not even his sister. Meanwhile, the entire family visited for weeks. When they visit here, they give us two hours out of a month and spend the rest with everyone else. They say they love us - but everything in their behavior says, “We don’t want you around.” It feels like they’re trying to keep us away from their child entirely, especially me, while gaslighting my fiancée into thinking she’s “too sensitive” or “overreacting.”

We’ve bent over backwards for them. We hosted her three-day bridal shower. Cooked for them, helped during her pregnancy while also working full-time. I even left work early, without being asked, so she could eat on time during her routine. Not once did they ask how my day was, how work’s going, or even say thanks. We’d greet her with “How are you? Want coffee?” like she was a guest in our home. She’d grunt “fine” and go scroll tiktok. Her husband, the brother, just keeps everything emotionally flat, avoids conflict like a coward, stays “neutral” while watching his wife be cold and nasty to us.

Once we went to visit them and were told last minute to get a hotel. We booked the cheapest one across the city. No one else in the family was ever asked to do that. Her brother later apologized, said he was ashamed, and begged us to cancel and stay with them. But the damage was done. The message was clear: we’re not welcome the way others are.
When we got engaged recently, we texted everyone. My ultra-religious muslim mother (who doesn’t accept my relationship and hasn’t visited my home in 4 years) still wrote a heartfelt message. My dad wrote ""wish you all the best, honey"". Her brother? Replied with “hahah I didn’t expect this.” No congratulations. When my fiancée said that hurt, he coldly replied “congrats”. His wife didn’t say anything to me at all. Then came to our home, sat silently for 3 hours, ate our food, and still couldn’t say a word of acknowledgment, even to my fiancée. Just... silence.

We brought it up. Said it felt cold and unkind. He got defensive, twisted everything back onto us. When we said, “Even my religious parents messaged us kindly to not ruin our moment,” he attacked my parents, saying, “Yeah? And did they text you after that? No? Exactly. It was fake.” He didn’t let me finish, he didn’t know they were going through a divorce that same week, and later called to apologize and say they now support me fully. But it didn’t matter. He just needed to win the argument.
When we talked about IVF, he (a doctor, mimd you!) said, “So you’re okay with having a kid with a stranger?” like he was disgusted. He also constantly undermines our work. My fiancée is in sales, I’m a designer. I have a stable, remote job with an indefinite contract, great pay, benefits - and I’m the sole provider for both of us right now while she’s job hunting because of the good job I have. He said I should “just work at McDonald’s” if I want to move abroad. His tone is always condescending. He brags about unlimited time off but couldn’t commit to saying he'll attend our simple courthouse wedding unless we tell him three months in advance. All we asked was that he be her best man for 15 minutes.

He talks over me, mocks our choices, and calls my fiancée “too emotional” anytime she expresses sadness or sets boundaries. He never apologizes, just defends, denies, and deflects. He says he “doesn’t care about anything” and “doesn’t believe in formalities.” But he sure knows how to show up for everyone else’s milestones and celebrations. It’s not about values - it’s about us.

Today was the breaking point. They said they’d visit. We cleared our schedule and waited for details. They told us nothing about the timing, like we don't have a life and I don't have to let my manager know I'll leave work early. My fiancée texted asking if they’re even coming last night. He finally replied, at 2am, cold, defensive, basically saying “You don’t have the right to be angry. I’ve been busy.” No apology. No accountability. Nothing. She broke down. Got drunk. Cried herself to sleep. Told them to not even bother coming, which angered him even more. The audacity.

I told her I can’t keep watching her be destroyed like this. I love her, but I don’t want to build a life with someone who lets others walk all over her out of some blind loyalty. She agreed. She’s finally seeing it. She’s heartbroken and ashamed. She thought she was loved. And now she sees, they never really respected her.

I’m not really looking for advice. We both know what we have to do. But I’d love to hear from others who’ve experienced similar family dynamics. When you realize people don’t actually love you, they just tolerate you when it’s convenient, how did you grieve that? How did you move on? What did you do?

Thank you for reading all this, if anyone does, I have so much to say and needed to vent. I also want to help my fiancée, but I don't know how anymore.

1m19e8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m19e8u/aitah_for_not_going_to_a_dinner_i_was_never/,AITAH for not going to a dinner I was never welcome to?,"This happened years ago, but it is still creating drama to this day, and I need a second opinion because I am going mad.

It was the last year of uni. Henry, Astrid and I were friends because we were in the same study program. The day before I left campus to start my first job, we were supposed to have dinner at Astrid's flat with some other classmates. Henry and Astrid were super close, while I was a bit of an outsider. But I did my best to get along with them because we would inevitably see each other a lot, and I was always kind to them.

The day of the dinner, Henry (who lived in the same flat as me), was acting weird. I thought it would be nice if we spent some time together since it was my last day there, so I asked him if he wanted to make iced coffee with me. He accepted, but refused to talk to me and was on his phone the entire time while I made the coffees. He grabbed his coffee without thanking me, drank it quickly and then went back into his room. It seemed like he was annoyed with me, but he didn't tell me why. Later that day, I texted him to ask when we were going to the grocery store. Astrid needed groceries for the dinner, so I thought the three of us could go together. He said I shouldn't come, and when I insisted because I needed a trip to the grocery store anyway, he said ""Don't come with us, we're going without you"", and seemed to have gone from annoyed to angry.

Confused and hurt, I went to the grocery store by myself. When Henry left to start cooking with Astrid, he didn't ask me to join and didn't even tell me that he left. He only texted me when the food was ready. I figured he was trying to tell me I wasn't welcome at the dinner, so I stayed in my flat. The next day, I left the flat as planned and drove to my new home. I then got a long, angry text from Astrid saying she and Henry had nooo idea why I didn't come to the dinner, and that I was a bad person because poor Henry got so sad when I didn't show?! I replied that her story was bullshit and unfriended her. I don't believe for a second that she wasn't in on this, but even if she wasn't, why attack me without knowing why I didn’t show up?

I never talked to her or Henry again, as I have no need for ""friends"" like this. Henry didn't reach out to me either.

I would have been peaceful with my decision if it hadn't been for our mutual friend, Monica. Since we finished uni, Monica has thrown a lot of parties where she invites many people from our old class, but never me. I suspected it might have something to do with the conflict with Henry and Astrid, but I didn't give it much thought because it could also be because I lived far away in the middle of nowhere, or because she didn't want me to bring my crazy dog to the party.

I have recently moved back to civilization, and on my birthday party, Monica was among the guests. One of my other friends brought up Monica's upcoming wheat bun party and asked if I was going. I awkwardly replied that I hadn't gotten an invitation. Monica then told me that I wasn't invited because I had ""something against Astrid and Erin (Astrid's BFF)"". This was new information to me, as I had no clue I had anything against Erin. I was tempted to ask Monica about this, but didn't want to cause a scene at my party.

The thing that baffles me the most is that Monica was so eager to jump in and choose sides without even asking me for my side of the story. Now I am questioning my friendship with her. You guys might suggest that we “talk it out”, but I am so sick and tired of this never-ending drama that our friendship has lost all value to me ...

1m198wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/morganblackwoodhorror/comments/1m198wt/the_truth_is_out_there/,The Truth is Out There,"People. Always searching for answers, for logic. But what if logic shatters reality, and the answers only plunge you deeper into the abyss? I'll tell you about Elara, and about the echoes that tore her world apart.

Elara opened her eyes every morning with a deep sigh of recognition. Not the fresh recognition of a new day, but the suffocating certainty that she had already lived all of this before. The scent of fresh coffee from neighbor Mr. Janssen's kitchen – a déjà vu. 

The exact newspaper headline she saw on the corner – a déjà vu. Every word her colleagues spoke, every step she took, was a perfectly rehearsed scene from a movie she had already seen countless times.

Elara's world was an eternal echo. It wasn't strange anymore; it was the normal state of being. Strange was it if something didn't feel like a déjà vu, though that almost never happened. 

She moved through her days like an actress in a play whose every line, every movement she knew. It made her efficient, almost eerily perfect. Mistakes from the ""past"" – which was now the present – were effortlessly avoided. Spontaneity was a myth, a distant, incomprehensible thought.

But the true gates to the unknown – or rather, the known – only opened when the sun set and the world fell silent. Because for Elara, and for everyone like her, dreams were not random figments of imagination. 

Dreams were lessons. They were the precursors, the deep, subconscious repetitions of past experiences that would feed the déjà vus of the coming day.

When Elara slept, she returned. She relived that crucial conversation with her mother years ago, the exact words spoken, the look in her eyes. She felt again the fall from the bicycle when she was eight, the sharp pain and the taste of blood. These dreams were not nostalgia; they were precise, inescapable examples. And when she woke up, the déjà vus of that day were the recognition of those dreams. 

The dream was the blueprint, the déjà vu the execution. It was a teaching, a preparation. The past whispered at night, and during the day, it lived on.

The Tear in the Script

One evening, Elara dreamt differently. She was in a room she didn't recognize, filled with strange machines and pulses of light. A voice spoke, unintelligible, but the tone was urgent, almost frantic. She saw images of a large, dark sphere slowly bursting open, and a feeling of pure, icy dread enveloped her. It was a dream without an echo from her conscious past, without the familiar contours of an already lived experience.

She woke up drenched in sweat, her heart pounding. The air in her bedroom felt heavy, unfamiliar. ""This is new,"" she whispered, an unfamiliar shiver running down her spine.
The day that followed was… off. Mr. Janssen's coffee didn't smell quite the same. The newspaper headline was slightly different from what her memory dictated. And when she greeted her colleague Arthur, the déjà vu – that constant, familiar flow of recognition – didn't come. Or worse: it was skewed. It felt like she had experienced it before, but the details didn't align. It was a distorted déjà vu, like a song out of tune.

Panic crept up. This was unprecedented. The rhythm was broken. Her world, which had been so predictable and safe in its repetition, began to tremble at its foundations. She tried to place the dream from the previous night, to connect it with something from her familiar archive, but it fit nowhere.

The Flash and the Memory

As she sat at her desk that afternoon, her head throbbing from the inexplicable dissonance, it happened. A bright, white flash filled her vision, so intense it hurt. It lasted only a fraction of a second, but in that flash, Elara saw something. A fragment.

She saw herself. Not the Elara she knew, but a younger version, hunched over a table full of screens and wires. Her eyes were possessed, a kind of manic focus. The room was exactly the one from her unknown dream. And the voice, the frantic voice from her dream, was her own.
The flash faded, and reality returned, but Elara was forever changed. She knew now.

The déjà vu. The dreams that foreshadowed the past. The perfect, cyclical nature of her existence. It wasn't a natural law. It was a loop.
The memory the flash had planted grew rapidly within her. She had done this. She had created this. The machines in the dream room. The voice. The plan to ""correct"" the future by endlessly repeating the past, to write the perfect script. But something had gone wrong. It had become a self-induced, time-correcting feedback loop. And now… the distorted déjà vu meant the loop was beginning to break.

Her breath hitched. She understood. The dream from the previous night wasn't a memory of her past. It was the memory of the creation of this reality. And the tearing déjà vus were the symptoms of the system beginning to fail.

Twisted Ending

Elara looked around, at her colleagues who plodded on unknowingly in their own pre-programmed déjà vus. Didn't they see the cracks? Didn't they feel the dissonance? Perhaps not yet. But it would come. It had to.
She stood up, her legs feeling strangely light. The world around her seemed to dissolve into a hazy, uncertain series of repetitions. 

The question was no longer why she had already experienced everything, but when the loop would completely collapse. And what would happen then. Would she finally truly live? Or would there only be chaos, a complete reset, a black hole of non-existence?

Elara walked to the window, looked at the city below. Every car, every pedestrian, every movement seemed both utterly new and painfully familiar. A smile stretched across her lips, a smile that contained both fear and a maniacal, dark liberation. The world was unwinding, and she was the architect of her own prison.

And the only question that remained was who or what had planted this memory of the ‘true’ creation in her mind. Was it a last, desperate attempt by the dying loop to repair itself, or a grim warning from the pure, undreamed chaos that lay in wait? 

And what would happen if the dream of that unknown room – her creation – the next time was no longer an example, but the reality?

Eating ice cream or a brownie, or a piece of candy is a special thing, for special occasions like holidays, birthdays, life accomplishments, reunions, etc. However, it's obvious to anyone who has had any social experience that people very commonly eat desserts. Some people can't finish a meal without having some aspect of it that is dessert. People eat chocolate, a bowl of icecream, sugar soda, or a candy, or a cookie, or something, very frequently - many every day!

This is an enormous amount of sugar and calories that are completely unnecessary and devoid of any nutrition. I love desserts, but it should be something that is more on the weekly side at most rather than something that we eat every meal or every day.

You can always obtain sweetness from fruit, even some vegetable juices like carrot or beet. Maybe a touch of sugar or honey in coffee or tea, even though that still really isn't great and can be a dessert in itself (esp commercial coffee drinks).

I've had many in the past and things usually fizzle out even when both of us thoroughly enjoy the story due to ""life"". Once I waited 6 months to continue a story I loved when my partner had work stuff, so I'm not typically the ghosting type. Not all stories and partners work out though, so it might be uncomfortable but if I'm really no longer interested, I'll try to let you know and I'd appreciate the same respect. 

I'm looking for an experienced and detailed partner who is 25+ and has a good grasp of the English language (though it doesn't have to be your first language, nor does your grammar have to be perfect). I have no time zone preferences. I'm comfortable with OC chatting but know I'm not interested in anything more than friendship, but if we don't vibe, this probably won't work out. 

I only want to rp one particular type of story, this is a non-negotiable but there's a lot of wiggle room in terms of creative control and brainstorming. I do want the story to be ours, not just mine. My favorite drink is a vanilla iced coffee. I want a fantasy based, personality clashing, forced proximity, enemies to lovers story full of intrigue, political tension, and uncertainty. I'm only interested in fxm parings, I only do ""fade to black"" if you understand what I mean (I'm not interested in ""those"" types of detailed scenes), I generally write 2 - 3 paragraphs per response, sometimes more, and I'm comfortable with replies coming in once a day or every other day since we all have busy lives. 

If this has caught your interest and you want to send me a message, please include what my favorite drink is and what types of characters you enjoy writing. If you don't know what my favorite drink is and have to scroll back up to find it, let's hope that means you were so excited to message me you neglected to read the entire post.

1m194o3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m194o3/i_work_at_a_grocery_store_that_doesnt_take_cash/,I work at a grocery store that doesn't take cash (pt 2/20),"That was how my first customer experience unfolded—unusual, unsettling, and completely unlike anything I’d ever expected. And then, there was only one more that day. A slow day indeed.

Near the end of my shift, the door chimed softly, and in walked my landlady.

Her cart was heavy—groaning under the weight of groceries piled high. Milk cartons, fresh chicken wrapped in butcher paper, boxes of cereal, jars of preserves, bundles of herbs, and more. One by one, she unloaded the items onto the long, old-fashioned table in front of me.
I packed diligently, folding paper bags and filling them with her goods, counting as I went. Twelve bags in total, large and bulging.

I glanced nervously at the spreadsheet pinned behind me, the familiar parchment curling at the edges. Scanning the handwritten list, I found an entry titled Large Grocery Shopping.

There it was:

>1-10 bags — friend
>10+ bags — pet

I cleared my throat, my voice barely steady. “Um, Mrs. Shirley… I see you’ve got over ten bags here.”

She gave me a slow, knowing smile—one that didn’t quite reach her eyes.

“By the way,” I asked, watching her arrange the last few bags in her cart, “What’s your name? Since I’m renting from you, I figured I should know.”

The old woman smiled, soft and grandmotherly, her hands folding over the cart handle with ease. “I’m Mrs. Shirley,” she said, with a warmth that briefly softened the weight in the air.

I nodded politely, then glanced back toward the register. Time to finish the transaction.

“To complete the payment today,” I said, my voice steadier than I expected, “Please answer this: What was your childhood pet?”

She blinked in surprise. “My pet?”

I smiled, just a little. “That’s what the register wants.”

She looked thoughtful for a moment, and then said, “Bird.”

Nothing.

The register remained dark.

I hesitated, then asked, “What was their name?”

Her eyes lit up slightly. “I named him Feathers.”

Ding.

A soft red light pulsed on the display. Payment accepted.

“Perfect,” I said, forcing a bit of cheer into my voice. “Have a great day, Mrs. Shirley.”

She gave me a small, satisfied nod, then slowly pushed her cart out of the store, her steps quiet, almost reverent. As the door shut behind her with a hollow click, the store fell silent again.

I exhaled and slumped forward, resting my head on the counter. A low groan escaped my lips, partly from exhaustion, partly from the quiet weight of too much strangeness and not enough understanding.

I stared at the flickering number 2 on the register.

It was still glowing.

But there were no customers in sight.

And yet… I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone—or something—was still waiting to be served.

I flinched as a throat cleared behind me. I hadn’t even heard him approach.

Mr. Stanstman stood just over my shoulder, hands folded neatly in front of him, his usual too-wide smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.

“You did well there,” he said. “You successfully processed a payment on your own.”

His tone was calm, but something about the way he said processed made the hair on my neck rise.

He glanced toward the dark windows. “It’s getting late, and it doesn’t seem like anyone else is coming. Go home.”

Relief washed over me, chased quickly by a rumble from my stomach. I hadn’t eaten since morning. The thought of food pulled me back to something more human, more grounded.

“Yeah,” I mumbled, lifting my head from the counter, “that’s a good idea.”

I remembered passing a small diner just down the road—a squat little building with a flickering neon sign that read Mabel’s in faded pink letters. I had wanted to try it since arriving.

With a flick of the switch beneath the register, I powered off the number box. The glowing yellow 1 faded into nothing, a quiet signal to the unseen: Closed.

I hung the apron on its hook, grabbed my coat, and stepped out into the cool evening air.

Behind me, the grocery store stood still—quiet and dark. But I swore, just as the door closed, I heard the faint hum of the register come back to life.

Only for a second.

The walk to the diner was short—just ten minutes along the quiet road that wound through the heart of the small town. The air was cool and still, the kind of stillness that made you feel watched, even when the street was empty.

The diner stood like a time capsule from the 1950s: chrome trim, flickering neon signs, and wide frosted windows glowing with warm yellow light. As I stepped inside, a small bell above the door gave a cheerful ding, announcing my arrival.

A short, blonde woman in her mind 30's turned at the sound. She wore a crisp, pale blue uniform with white trim—classic, old-fashioned. Her name tag read Mabel, though the letters were worn nearly to dust.

“Evenin',” she said, smiling in a way that seemed practiced but not unfriendly. “Sit wherever you like.”

I chose a booth near the window, the plastic seat creaking softly as I slid into it. She followed close behind and handed me a menu—just a single laminated sheet with a few pictures and a short list of classic meals: burgers, grilled cheese, eggs any style, pie.

My eyes instinctively scanned the page for prices.

And I sighed in relief.

Actual numbers. Five dollars. Eight-fifty.

No cryptic trades. No questions. Just ordinary food, for ordinary money.

At least… I hoped.

Mabel waited patiently by the table, pen poised above her notepad.

“Know what you’d like?” she asked.

I looked up at her, suddenly aware of how tired I was, how empty my stomach felt, and how strange my day had been.

“Something simple,” I said. ""A cheeseburger, fries, and a sweet tea"" —simple, familiar, grounding.

As the waitress disappeared behind the counter, I let my eyes wander across the diner, scanning for anything unusual. The lighting buzzed faintly above, flickering once in a way that was probably just old wiring. The booths were worn but clean, the floor scuffed from years of footsteps, and a soft hum played from the old jukebox in the corner—some sleepy jazz instrumental, the kind meant to fill silence without drawing attention.

Everything seemed normal.

Aside from me, there was only one other customer: a man seated at the very back, hunched over a chipped mug of coffee. His eyes were distant, staring down into the dark liquid as though it held some kind of answer. He hadn’t moved since I walked in—not a sip, not a shift in posture.

I looked away quickly, unsure why he unsettled me so much. Maybe it was just the day I’d had.

Lost in thought, I didn't even notice the waitress return until I caught the clink of ceramic on formica.

She had set my plate down in front of me with quiet efficiency: the cheeseburger steaming, the fries golden and crisp, a tall glass of sweet tea beading with condensation. The smell hit me then—grilled meat, toasted bread, and the faint metallic tinge of ketchup. Comfort food.

“Here you go, sugar,” she said, her voice soft and honey-thick. “Eat up while it’s hot.”

I nodded, offering a quiet “Thanks,” It looked perfect.

Her blue eyes settled on me with a flicker of curiosity, and without asking, she slid into the booth across from me.

Uninvited, but not unwelcome—at least not yet.

“Hm?” I mumbled around a mouthful of fries, blinking in surprise.

She smiled—bright, youthful, but not without a hint of something unreadable beneath it. “You’re new in town,” she said. “I’ve never seen you before. It’s a small place. I know everyone.”

I nodded, wiping my mouth with a napkin and straightening up a bit. “Yeah, just arrived a couple of days ago. I’m Marie.”

“Ashley,” she replied, giving a small wave. “I’ve been here for… years, I think. As far as I can remember.”

Something about the way she said it made me pause. As far as I can remember.

“Oh?” I offered casually. “Must be nice, working here at the diner.”

She tilted her head, considering. “It has its moments,” she said, then her gaze sharpened. “You work at the grocery store, don’t you?”

I nodded slowly. “Yeah. Just started today, actually. Came here for a fresh start.”

“Fresh starts,” she repeated softly, almost like she was tasting the words. Then she smiled again. “Those are rare here.”

I gave a short, awkward laugh. “What about you? What brought you here?”

Ashley tapped her bottom lip with a finger, thoughtful. “Quiet,” she said at first. “To focus on my music.”

A beat.

Then she frowned, eyes narrowing slightly.

“I… play the piano. I think.”

The words left her mouth like she wasn’t quite sure of them—as if she were reciting from someone else’s memory.

My stomach twisted, just slightly. She thinks she plays?

“You think?” I echoed gently, trying not to let my concern show too much.

She blinked, clearly startled by her own uncertainty. “Yeah. I used to practice every day. But now, I’m not sure where my piano is.” She gave a small, almost apologetic laugh. “Weird, right?”

I studied her for a moment. There was nothing overtly strange about her. She looked real. Solid. Her hair was tucked behind one ear, and her hands rested easily on the table.

But something about her felt… faded. Like a person in a photograph left out in the sun too long.

I brushed off the oddness, blaming it on hunger more than anything else. My stomach growled insistently, pulling me back to the warmth of the plate in front of me.

“Sorry,” I said with a sheepish gesture toward my food. “Starving.”

Ashley seemed to take the hint. She gave me a gentle nod, her expression unreadable, and quietly slid out of the booth. Without another word, she walked to the far end of the diner and disappeared behind a set of swinging doors, her footsteps light as breath.

Alone again, I dug in.

The meal was delicious—comforting, familiar. The burger was juicy, the fries crisp and perfectly salted. The sweet tea was cold and just the right kind of sweet, like something brewed from an old family recipe. It was the first real meal I’d had since arriving, and somehow, that made it taste even better.

When I finished, I wiped my hands, dropped a few bills on the table, and stood up to leave. No questions. No lights flashing red.

Just… a meal.

As I stepped outside, the cool evening air greeted me like a quiet sigh. The town was cloaked in soft darkness now, the streetlamps flickering to life one by one. I zipped my jacket and began the short walk back to the house.

It was one of the few blessings here—everything was within walking distance. That meant I didn’t have to touch the dwindling fuel in my van or the thin stack of bills in my wallet.

But even as I walked, enjoying the silence, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had shifted.

Maybe it was Ashley.

Maybe it was the look in her eyes when she talked about her piano.

Or maybe it was just this town—too quiet, too still, like it was holding its breath.

The sun was slipping below the trees as I reached my house, casting long shadows across the street in warm, bruised hues of orange and violet. On the porch next door, my landlady—Mrs. Shirley—was gently rocking on a wooden swing, the chains creaking softly in rhythm with the breeze.

I raised a hand in greeting. “Hi there, Shirley. Enjoying the sunset?”

She turned her head slowly, as though pulled from a trance, and blinked in surprise at the sight of me. “Oh! Hello, dear. Yes, it’s lovely this evening, isn’t it?”

I walked over to her, leaning casually against the porch rail, trying to be friendly. “Do you live alone over here? No partner or pets?” I asked, hoping to make small talk and maybe learn a bit more about her. The question came out light, innocent.

She paused.

Her eyes drifted toward the empty window behind her before returning to me.

“No,” she said, voice warm but distant. “It’s just me now. I’m not much of a pet person.”

I gave a soft hum, keeping my tone neutral. “Huh. That’s funny—I thought you said you had a pet growing up.”

A flicker passed through her expression—so fast I might’ve imagined it. A twitch at the corner of her eye, a moment’s stiffness in her hands as they rested in her lap.

Then she smiled again. “Oh, did I? Well, I suppose I must’ve. People remember the strangest things, don’t they?”

She resumed her slow swinging, the chains creaking once more like a lullaby slightly out of tune.

I smiled politely, though my mind was already turning.

Because I remembered exactly what she said.

A bird named Feathers.

And the register had accepted it.

The soft scraping of her slippers against the wooden porch broke the silence.

“Well,” she said, rising slowly, “good night, dear. It’s late, and I’m tired from my day in town.”

Before I could respond, she shuffled to her door and slipped inside. The front door clicked shut behind her, a gentle but final sound that seemed to echo a little too long in the quiet air.

I stood there for a moment, alone again, staring at her darkened windows.

How could she forget her own pet?
Or worse… why pretend she never had one?

A breeze stirred the trees nearby, rustling the branches like whispering voices just out of reach. I shivered.

Shaking the thought, I turned and walked to my own front door. The knob was cold in my hand. Inside, the house was dim and still. I dropped my keys onto the hallway table and leaned against the door for a moment.

It had been a strange day—long, unsettling day, full of rules I didn’t understand and people who seemed to be forgetting pieces of themselves.

And now I was part of it.

As I moved deeper into the house, the floorboards creaked beneath my steps, familiar yet faintly echoing—like the house, too, was trying to remember me.

She had been married to all three of them in her last life.In the upper circles, everyone knew the Thompson, Vegara, Vanderpool, and Dalton families were the four powerhouses of Chicago.Emma, the only daughter among the four, had become the most sought-after bride—each of the other three families wanted to marry into the Dalton family.In her previous life, when she was choosing her marriage partner for the first time, she chose Isaac Thompson, and she happily thought that she would be happy for the rest of her life.However, after they got married, he was not at home for 364 out of 365 days a year, not only making her a laughing stock in the circle but also dying in a chain car accident while trying to protect Janet.Emma had been widowed at a young age, losing her first husband and spending three years alone before being remarried to Anthony Vegara—another match arranged by her family.However, Anthony never cared about the marriage. To him, Emma meant nothing. In their second year together, he died in a reckless racing accident—all for Janet.Because of this, people started calling Emma a husband-killer. It was not until she turned 30 that she married Mateo Vanderpool.This time, their marriage was quiet and respectful. They lived peacefully, growing old together—until Mateo fell ill. Before he died, he held her hand and whispered his final wish.""Emma, if there's another life, please don't marry me. I just want to be with Janet.""It was then Emma realized that all of them had loved Janet.That was why, before they each died, their last words were always the same, ""Don't choose me for marriage.""Janet was just the daughter of the Dalton family's butler. She was neither beautiful nor talented. All she knew how to do was act fragile and sweet.Emma never understood how she lost to someone like that. She never knew why the men loved Janet so much that they were even willing to marry Emma just to protect Janet from being used by the family.Emma spent her whole life watching them love Janet, and her whole life learning one simple truth.She, Emma Dalton, was never anyone's supporting role.She did not want someone who did not want her.So in this life, she did not pick any of the same men. Instead, she gave her parents a new answer.""If I'm getting married, I only want Samuel from the Lockwood family.""Brent and Cassandra were stunned.""Samuel? The illegitimate son of the Lockwoods in New York? Why would you want to marry him all of a sudden?""Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and held massive sway in the business world.If this marriage was for the family's benefit, then Emma needed to get the most out of it.Samuel was a man who came with nothing but advantages.As for love? She had stopped hoping for that.Even though Brent and Cassandra were strongly opposed at first, Emma racked her brain to come up with reason after reason.""New York's economy is booming, and the Lockwood Group is the most influential family there. Haven't you always wanted to break into the New York market but had to back off because we didn't have a foothold? Marrying Samuel is our chance. You've even said it yourselves—Samuel is ambitious, sharp, and ruthless. A man like that is bound to achieve great things.""Emma's analysis was solid, and they could not find any flaw in her logic.After weighing the pros and cons, they finally decided to support her choice. They took the initiative to contact the Lockwood family and finalize the engagement.""Emma, both families have come to an agreement. The wedding will be held in half a month.""When she heard that, Emma finally felt a bit of relief settle in her chest.Time was tight, so Brent and Cassandra hurried to prepare the dowry.Emma sat alone on the couch, her mind a swirl of thoughts and emotions all tangled up.Just then, footsteps sounded at the door.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo stepped inside, their eyes immediately landing on her.""Emma, who did you choose to marry?""They asked in unison, their faces full of tension and seriousness. For a moment, Emma was dazed.The four of them had grown up together. They were childhood friends who were practically inseparable.Those three had always treated her like a princess and spoiled her endlessly.Whatever she wanted, they gave it to her. Whenever she was upset, they comforted her, and whenever she was bullied, they stood up for her first.Back then, she truly believed that it was because they cared deeply.In her previous life, when they rushed in with those same questions, she had thought it was because they were excited to be chosen.Now, she saw it clearly. They were not hoping to be picked, and that was what those expressions meant.That realization made her heartache. Her chest felt tight as if she could not breathe.After a long silence, she finally composed herself, then replied in a low, raspy voice.""In 15 days, you'll know who I chose.""Emma did not budge, still keeping her answer to herself. The three of them were starting to get impatient, clearly eager to press her for more.However, before she could say anything else, her phone rang.""Emma, Janet was badly hurt in an accident and she's in the hospital right now. But there aren't any available wards. Can you help us?"" The tearful voice of the butler, Horace Jameson, trembled through the speaker.Before Emma could even react, Isaac grabbed the phone from her, his tone tight with concern.""Which hospital?""There was a pause on the other end. Then, choking on emotion, Horace named the hospital.Isaac hung up immediately, turned to Emma, and said, ""Don't worry about it, Emma. I'll handle the hospital situation. It's nothing.""Without missing a beat, Anthony and Mateo also jumped in.""The hospital's owned by the Vegara family. I'll talk to the director myself. Just stay home and rest, Emma.""""I know some top-tier specialists. I'll reach out to them, so you don't need to worry.""They all claimed they were doing it for her, but Emma knew the truth—they were all just looking for excuses to rush to Janet's side.How had she missed it before? Their feelings had been right in front of her the whole time.As she watched their backs disappear out the door, Emma gave a faint, bitter smile.Then she turned away, walked back to her room, and quietly began packing everything related to them.By the time she finished, night had fallen. She picked up her phone and saw Janet's newest post on her feed.""Another day of being doted on by the three powerful men.""Attached was a selfie from the VIP ward.She was sipping Mateo's signature soup while Isaac's watch sat neatly on the bedside table. Meanwhile, Anthony's jacket was draped over the chair beside her.Emma tapped ""Like"" on the post, then looked at the three boxes she had just packed.Each box held the gift she had received at 18—one from Isaac's father, one from Anthony's mother, and one from Mateo's grandfather. All three were heirlooms from the three families.Whichever one she chose to keep would symbolize her family's decision on which family to form a marriage alliance with.Now, her marriage had already been decided and it was time to give her an answer.Emma called a courier to her home and handed the three boxes to him.""Please mail these out separately—15 days from today.""Chapter 2After mailing out the packages, Emma tossed everything she had just organized straight into the trash.The jewelry and designer bags gifted by Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo, the old videos and photos from their time together, even the custom suits she had designed for them with care...All of it—every memory tied to them—was now part of the past, discarded without hesitation.In this life, Emma was not going to repeat her old mistakes.She poured all her focus into preparing for the wedding, tuning out the world outside her own little bubble.After a few hectic days of picking out her dress and accessories, she finally came home—only to find Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo all fussing over Janet.One was adjusting the AC temperature, another gently fanning a bowl of soup to cool it down, and the third was draping a blanket over her, asking how she was feeling with sincere concern.Watching Janet being doted on like royalty, Emma could not help but smile bitterly to herself.The affection was so obvious now, how had she missed it before?The ache in her chest tightened, leaving her feeling drained and a little hollow.Right then, Janet noticed her standing at the door. Startled like a timid bird, Janet quickly got to her feet, her expression filled with fear and deference.""Emma, you're back! I'll go heat up some water and get dinner started. Please give me a moment.""She started to rise, but Isaac gently held her down.""Janet's still recovering. There are plenty of other staff around. Emma, just ask someone else to handle it.""Anthony and Mateo chimed in as well. ""She's still pretty injured. Emma, just let her rest.""""If you're really short on help, we can always transfer more staff. There's no need for Janet to be doing chores in her condition.""Since the moment she walked in, Emma had said nothing—yet she was being lectured like she'd done something wrong.She let out a quiet breath and narrowed her eyes slightly. ""I know she's the daughter of our butler, not our maid. And I've never forced her to do anything. But since you all care about her so much, maybe you should just take her home and look after her yourselves. That way, you don't have to worry so much.""Janet's eyes widened in shock and she immediately dropped to her knees.""Emma, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have slacked off just because I'm sick. Please don't drive me and my dad away. I'll get up right now and get to work.""Her knee hit the ground hard and they bruised instantly. Her tears streamed down her face like rain, looking like she had been deeply wronged.The moment her tears started falling, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo's expressions darkened.The three of them rushed to help Janet up, shielding her behind them as they all turned to Emma, their voices tinged with frustration.""Janet didn't do anything wrong. Why are you trying to kick her out for no reason? Do you really have to bully her like this?""""She's still hurt and was trying to heat your water and make you dinner. Not only do you not care about her condition, but you're also forcing her to leave. Do you have no heart at all?""""She's hurt even worse now. If anything happens to her later because of this, are you just going to pretend it's nothing? Will you only be satisfied if she completely breaks down?""Watching them so naturally jump to defend Janet, Emma's expression turned colder by the second.""I didn't do anything except suggest that you take her home if you're that worried. That's considered bullying now? In your eyes, am I really that unreasonable and difficult? So no matter what happens, she's the victim and I'm the one to blame?""Her words brought silence crashing down on the room.Seeing their frozen expressions, Emma felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.She did not want to say anything more. Without another word, she turned and walked back to her bedroom.Just as she had finally calmed down, there was a knock at the door.Janet came in timidly, holding a cup of coffee. ""I'm sorry, Emma. Please don't be angry at them. They only spoke like that because they were too worried about me. It's my fault you ended up fighting. If you need someone to blame, blame me.""Having lived through this once already, Emma knew exactly what Janet was trying to do. She would put on a pitiful act and stir the pot.""Leave the coffee and get out.""Emma's voice was cold and detached. Hearing that, Janet looked even more wronged, but she did not dare push back.Then, she pretended to fumble and spilled the entire cup of coffee.The hot liquid splashed onto Emma, scalding her skin until it turned red and blistered.Emma let out a hiss of pain and instinctively shoved Janet's helping hand away.Janet took the chance to stumble backward dramatically, slamming her head against the edge of the table. A bloody gash instantly opened on her forehead.Her sharp cries filled the entire villa.Before Emma could even react, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo burst through the door.Seeing Janet unconscious on the floor with blood running down her head, the three of them instantly panicked.Anthony shoved past Emma without hesitation. Isaac rushed forward and scooped Janet into his arms, while Mateo pressed down on the wound to stop the bleeding.They hurried off, completely focused on protecting Janet. No one even noticed Emma had stumbled into the glass display case.Shards flew everywhere as the glass shattered, slicing into her skin and leaving her covered in cuts.Blood soaked through her clothes. Her face twisted in pain, and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.Watching their figures disappear down the hall, Emma could not hold back her tears any longer.Her heart ached so much it felt like she could not breathe. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from sobbing out loud.Only one final thought echoed in her mind: She had to walk away from their world for good. Never again would she let herself be part of it.Chapter 3After pushing through the pain and getting her wounds treated at the hospital, Emma took the prescription and headed to the pharmacy window—only to spot a few familiar figures outside the next ward.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo were standing outside Janet's room, their faces full of worry and heartache.""I've said it before, Janet's too soft. If she stays there, she's just going to keep suffering. Once the marriage is finalized, I'll find a way to get her out, no matter what. I don't want her to go through this anymore.""""Now that our parents know Janet's the one we really care about, we have to make sure she's protected. So no matter who Emma chooses, that guy has to accept the marriage and go along with it. That's the only way the family won't come after Janet.""Emma stood there quietly, listening to every word, and suddenly felt her chest tighten.So this was why they had gone along with the marriage in the previous life even when they clearly did not want to.They thought they were protecting someone they loved even if it meant sacrificing their own happiness.Yet, in doing so, they wrecked hers.She looked down and laughed bitterly, tears blurring her vision.They could relax this time as no one would have to sacrifice anything.Once she collected herself, she wiped away her tears and turned to leave—only for her phone alarm to go off suddenly.The sharp ringtone startled the three men. When they opened the door and saw her standing there, they all froze in surprise.""You're here? Are you planning to apologize to Janet?""""How much did you hear just now?""""What's with all those injuries? What happened to you?""They all spoke at once, questions flying at her.Emma answered calmly, one by one. ""I got hurt because you pushed me aside to get to Janet. I came here to get treatment, not to apologize. She spilled the hot coffee on me first, and I pushed her away. Running into you here was just a coincidence.""Hearing her words, the three men fell silent, their expressions shifting into something more complicated.After a moment, Anthony was the first to speak.""Janet didn't mean to spill the coffee. She's still recovering, so her hands are weak. Don't be mad at her. When we walked in and saw all that blood, we thought it was serious. That's why we lost it. I'm sorry.""Isaac also took a breath and calmed down. ""We weren't trying to blame you earlier. We just felt bad for Janet, so we said a few things on her behalf.""""Yeah,"" Mateo added, ""we all grew up together. You've always been the one who mattered most to us. Have you thought about the marriage?""As soon as he asked, the three of them stared at Emma, clearly nervous about her response.Emma looked at them, her expression unreadable. After what she had just overheard, all she felt was a bitter irony.""Thought it through?"" She gave a cold smile. ""I... ""Before she could finish, a sudden loud beeping came from the monitor in Janet's room.Their faces changed instantly, and they all rushed back in to check. Medical staff poured into the ward right after them.""The patient's kidneys were already compromised after the second trauma,"" a doctor explained urgently. ""We didn't catch it in time and administered the wrong medication. It's led to acute kidney failure. Her condition is very serious now!""Isaac's face went pale, his eyes red with panic.""How could you mess this up? She's still so young! If you ruin her life because of negligence, can you live with that?""Anthony grabbed the doctor by the collar and barked furiously, ""You've got half an hour. I want a treatment plan that guarantees results. If anything happens to her, you'll answer for it.""Mateo was already on the phone, frantically calling every contact he had.""Dr. Zimmerman, you're the best nephrologist in the country. Please, this is urgent. I need your help to save someone extremely important. Where are you now? I'll send my secretary to pick you up right away.""The whole ward was in chaos. Everyone was on edge, trying everything they could for Janet.Soon, the hospital pulled together a special team and quickly outlined the only viable solution.""She needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible,"" one specialist explained. ""But finding the right donor will take time. And the longer we wait, the higher the risk to her life.""Chapter 4After hearing the diagnosis, the three men did not hesitate for a second and immediately went to get tested for a match.The results came out quickly and Isaac was a compatible donor.Without a word, he picked up the consent form the doctor handed over, signed it on the spot, and walked straight into the operating room.Time ticked by slowly, and just as everyone was getting more and more anxious, a new problem cropped up.A nurse burst out of the OR in a panic, her voice urgent.""The hospital's blood bank is running low. The patient is hemorrhaging and needs a large amount of blood, fast!""Anthony and Mateo, who had been waiting nearby, immediately rolled up their sleeves.""We have the same blood type as Janet. Take our blood!""""But her condition is critical, and the two of you alone won't be enough. You need to call more donors... """"There's no time,"" Anthony interrupted. ""The two of us will do. Take as much as you need. Just save her!""The nurse had no choice but to rush them into the transfusion room.The red light outside the OR blinked nonstop, making Emma feel dizzy.She had seen everything—the panic, the surgery, and the blood donation. Right now, her mind was completely blank.In her previous life, when Isaac and Anthony died for Janet, she had not been there. She only learned about it afterward, buried in grief and confusion, unable to understand why they would risk everything for Janet.However, after everything that happened, she finally understood—they loved Janet so much that they were willing to give up everything for her.Be it marriage or their lives, they never thought twice, always putting her first no matter the cost.So, no, she could never compete with Janet.Yet, it did not matter anymore because this time, Emma had already decided to let go. She would step out of their tangled love story once and for all.Eventually, the OR light went off, and the doctor came out, wiping sweat from his brow.""Are you the family? The surgery was a success, so she'll wake up soon. However, the kidney donor needs monitoring in the ICU, and the two who donated blood passed out from blood loss. Can you handle taking care of four people on your own?""Emma shook her head, parted her dry lips, and spoke with a hoarse voice.""I have nothing to do with the four of them, but I can help contact their families. They should be here soon.""After saying that, she sent messages to the Thompson, Vegara, and Vanderpool families, as well as to Horace, briefly explaining the situation.She turned to leave, only to catch whispers from a few nearby nurses.""She's not related? I thought she was the wife of one of those three handsome guys!""""How could she be? If your husband risked his life for another woman, would you be okay with that? I bet those three are all in love with that girl. Why else would they be so desperate to save her?""Emma listened in silence, her lips curving into a faint, bitter smile.The nurses were right—Janet had always been the one whom the three men loved.And Emma would never be their wife again.Dragging her bruised and aching body back home, Emma found her parents waiting in the living room.When Brent and Cassandra saw the wounds on her body, their brows furrowed in concern. Not wanting them to worry, she quickly came up with a simple excuse.Hearing that her injuries were not serious and would heal soon, they finally relaxed and handed her a box.""This is the marriage token from the Lockwood family. Keep it safe. Samuel has already received the one we sent him.""""Just now, Mr. Thompson, Mrs. Vegara, and Mateo's grandfather all called to ask about the marriage and even mentioned Janet. They said the three boys are just too softhearted, but you're the one they truly care about. We didn't really know how to respond, and it's hard to judge the situation. You're old enough now to make your own choices. Your father and I won't interfere.""Emma reassured them and promised she would handle it herself.Over the next two days, she quietly gathered information on the Lockwood family and Samuel to get a better sense of who he was.Once she had a general understanding, she went to the mall and carefully picked out gifts that matched the Lockwood family's preferences.After a long day of shopping, she returned home with a car full of presents—only to see Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo waiting at the door.They had also brought gifts, nearly filling the entire living room.Noticing her confused expression, the three exchanged glances and then began to explain one after another.""These were prepared by our families,"" one of them said. ""They wanted us to come and apologize to you in person. You saw what happened that day—Janet was on the brink of death. She got injured again because of you, and we lost control. That's why you got hurt.""""Emma, if you're holding any anger, take it out on us. Just don't involve the elders, and don't blame Janet for everything. She was a victim too.""Emma could tell immediately that they were only here because their families made them come. Forced to apologize, and forced to speak on Janet's behalf.She was not in the mood to argue, so she simply responded with distant politeness.""Take your gifts away. This matter isn't worth talking about anymore. I'm tired, so I'd like to rest now.""As she spoke, she rubbed her aching eyes and reached into her bag to pull out her phone.Without noticing, the box containing the Lockwood family's marriage token slipped out and landed right at Isaac's feet. He bent down to pick it up.""What's this?""Anthony and Mateo glanced over, and the second they saw the box, their expressions changed.""A marriage token?"" Anthony asked, eyes narrowing. ""Emma, you've already chosen who you want to marry? Who is it?""",2,1752661824.0,BlackNovel,3,1.0,False

1m192wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m192wm/whats_the_difference_between_delonghi_and/,What’s the difference between De'Longhi and Breville espresso machines?,"As a coffee lover, I've spent years experimenting with different espresso machines. Two brands that often come up in discussions are De'Longhi and Breville. I've used both, and I want to share my thoughts on how they compare.

De'Longhi machines are known for their reliability and ease of use. They're great for beginners who want to make good espresso without a steep learning curve. Most De'Longhi models have a compact design, perfect for small kitchens. They often include features like a built-in grinder and milk frother, making them all-in-one solutions.

Breville, on the other hand, tends to offer more advanced features. Their machines usually have more customization options, allowing you to fine-tune your espresso. They're popular among coffee enthusiasts who enjoy experimenting with different brewing techniques. Breville machines often have a larger footprint but come with a sleek, modern design.

When it comes to price, De'Longhi generally offers more budget-friendly options. You can find decent De'Longhi espresso makers for under $200. Breville machines usually start at a higher price point but offer more premium features.

In terms of durability, both brands are solid choices. I've had my De'Longhi for over five years with no issues. Breville machines are also built to last, though some users report needing repairs after a few years of heavy use.

One area where Breville shines is temperature control. Many of their models allow you to adjust the brewing temperature, which can significantly affect the taste of your espresso. De'Longhi machines typically have preset temperatures, which work well for most users but might frustrate coffee perfectionists.

De'Longhi's milk frothing systems are often simpler to use, making them great for latte and cappuccino lovers who want quick results. Breville's steam wands usually offer more control but require more skill to use effectively.

If you're looking to explore different espresso machines, I've found a great selection at https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They offer both De'Longhi and Breville models, so you can compare features and prices easily.

Ultimately, the choice between De'Longhi and Breville comes down to your personal preferences and budget. If you're new to espresso making and want a reliable, easy-to-use machine, De'Longhi is a great choice. If you're a coffee enthusiast who loves to experiment and doesn't mind spending a bit more, Breville might be the way to go.

Remember, the best espresso machine is the one that fits your needs and helps you enjoy your coffee routine. Whether you choose De'Longhi, Breville, or another brand, the most important thing is that you're happy with your morning brew.

1m190g3,https://v.redd.it/1zaknqqso7df1,Wednesday freebie - Jayden,"Jayden is newly hired lawyer at a medium to good big company in Chicago. 

He's usually dressing up quite casual when at home but recently, suits are starting to be his preferred choice of clothing. The only thing is that he... well, there are no other ways to say it : he gets turned on as soon as he's wearing one. 

Can be quite a situation at times at work, where he had to indulge in letting some of his straight colleagues have a go at him during the coffee break. He enjoyed that a lot, but when at home, sometimes it's just him in front of his mirror...

Welcome to the future of Digital Product Passports","Imagine scanning a QR code on your coffee machine, sneakers, or even sofa — and instantly knowing where every part came from, how to recycle it, or who made it.

That’s not sci-fi anymore. It’s the promise of **Digital Product Passports (DPPs)** — and the EU is making them a reality by 2026.

But here's where it gets interesting:

* How will small brands adapt to this change?
* Will DPPs become a **trust layer** for e-commerce?
* Could this be the start of **“Google for Products”**, where you search *any object’s lifecycle*?

This subreddit is here to explore all of that — the good, the bad, and the… blockchain.",1,1752661548.0,productpassports,0,1.0,False
