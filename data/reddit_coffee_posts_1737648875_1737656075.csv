1i89uuf,https://i.redd.it/32wfmfsibsee1.jpeg,Are there THREE mosque kitchens???,"The one on Nicolson opposite KFC is its own thing (and has a takeaway), that I understand. And I’ve looked on here and everyone just talks about there being 2 (the one on Nicolson and the one in the mosque courtyard)

But my coworker and I seem to have gone to different ones in the courtyard. I showed her the first pic which I took, and she said no she went to the one down the stairs. So I assume she went to the blue arrow, and I went to the pink. I thought maybe the blue was just outdoor seating for the pink, but there was no door to go outside in the pink and blue seems to have its own (limited) indoor seating. Are they 2 different places?? 

Bottom left pic is where I went, I assume bottom right pic is where my coworker went. Both bottom pictures are taken from Google maps and are both under “Original Mosque Kitchen and Cafe” but they each have a menu and a till",2,1737656031.0,Edinburgh,0,1.0,False

I have a bad habit of spending outside my budget on “fun drinks”. Think coffees, sodas, energy drinks, and stuff like that. I’ve been able to almost completely cut out coffee spending by investing in a decent second-hand espresso machine but am having a hard time with stopping buying sodas. 

Does anyone have recipes for “fun drinks” that can be made for cheap at home and might scratch the same itch for a sweet treat?",1,1737655882.0,Cheap_Meals,0,1.0,False

To my surprise, the same coffee I usually get in Calgary was way cheaper back home! It's crazy how pricing can vary so much between countries for something as simple as a McDonald's coffee

Stopped to get coffee and the place had quite an extensive sugar free flavor menu. One of which was peanut butter. Wasn't sure if it would be any good in an iced latte. Ordered it. The barista warned me it was more of a peanut butter cup flavor. Told her I'm totally in, let's do it. 

Loved every sip of it. Honestly wish I would have ordered it more than once while in Nashville. Luckily for me, my best friend lives there and the place is 5 minutes from his house. So I'll make sure I get it again when I go back. 

Didn't think to take any photos. So I'm sorry for that.",1,1737655731.0,PeanutButter,0,1.0,False

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

1i89pbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/1i89pbt/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 23/01/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

1i89ozt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i89ozt/some_customers_in_retail_should_not_be_customers/,Some customers in retail should not be customers in retail. Fml,"If I could put two flares, this would also be under HOW ARE YOU NOT EMBARRASSED?! 

For anyone who hasn’t seen me post, I work at dollar general. I am a minimum wage cashier. I literally don’t get paid enough for this. 

So, background. I have a very loving boyfriend who is a software engineer. Due to a hard loss in his life, he lost a lot of his contacts, and he doesn’t have a degree, so finding a job has been hard for him. He did just accept a position for 140,000 salary, so we will be moving soon (Thankfully). 

Now, to my very horrible day at work two weeks ago. A regular customer walked in and asked me to help him find something. The particular thing he was looking for was in an aisle with no cameras. I didn’t think anything of it at the time because he comes in so often. 

I led him to the aisle, started looking on the shelf. I was turned sideways from him. He grabbed me from the side (I have never hugged this man) and started hu**ing my leg. I pushed him off of me. After I did he said, “If your boyfriend had caught us we’d be in trouble.” As if I had participated and not shoved him off of me. 

After that, I walked to the front of the store, and simply looked the item up on the dg app. We were out of stock. He left the store immediately. I told my MOD what happened, but since he had left, there wasn’t much that could be done right then.

The next day, I told my assistant manager what happened. He was trespassed later that day while I was on shift. Luckily my boyfriend had showed up to bring me coffee, so I hid in his car the whole time. 

A few days later, he showed up at my boyfriend’s place, saying he had seven days to get dollar general to drop the trespass or they would “settle it like men.” I wasn’t there, but he texted me as soon as he left. My boyfriend said he didn’t say anything so he didn’t incriminate himself. 

6 days later, he showed up again. He said that my boyfriend had one more day or he would stick his dog on my boyfriend’s mom’s cats. Yeah, she had a gun on the side table waiting for him. 

HE NEVER SHOWED! He was all talk, no action it would seem. I was filing police reports each time hoping something would be done but… nope. But that’s the system for you. They don’t lift a finger until you are dead or in serious danger. 

What I find strange is that he is the cousin of my boyfriend’s stalker. Who is the landlord of his mom’s home, which he lives in now. We plan to be out of here by march hopefully. Fingers crossed. I’m so ready to leave this entire mess behind me.

It came out beautifully out of the oven, came clean when I inserted a toothpick in the middle, but when I went to cut it (after leaving it to cool for over 4 hours) I noticed the middle had become gooey/not set. Any reason why this would happen during the cooking stage?

I was working with a gaming company for a while and they gave me a PC, but I don't have a need for it anymore. Any idea what I could sell this for?  It's not the latest and greatest, so I'm clueless about what this might go for.

This is my favorite game of all time. I have over 400 hours in this game. I had completed every possible thing there is to do. I had a completed hall of gods, all 4 pantheons with every binding, path of pain, and all achievements but one. The one thing I had yet to beat was P5. 

I had decided I needed to beat it before Silksong released, so I was grinding Markoth, Pure Vessel, and Radiance for about a week.

Then, this morning, before I even had my coffee, it all came together. My heart was beating out of my chest during the final laserbeam climb.

I feel so damn accomplished, but I still have the 4 bindings on P5. That might be the one thing I have to leave unfinished because shit that seems time consuming. I might not have it in me 😂",6,1737655328.0,HollowKnight,2,1.0,False

This was my set-up back in they in a dorm they called ""Hotel Morrill"".  Sega Genesis with wireless controllers, a pair of Cerwin Vega speakers, ProScan TV and (not pictured) a Cerwin Vega 12-inch Subwoofer/coffee table.  

Fun fact: to the left of the genesis/VDR/Kenwood Receiver, you can see the center portion of Michael Scott's boombox from ""The Office"". The detached speakers are flanking the TV.  

The Genesis sounded (and looked) AMAZING in this setup. The pic cannot do justice to this epic system.

1i89jth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1i89jth/chronic_yeast_looking_for_help_from_anyone/,"chronic yeast, looking for help from anyone","Hey all, im super grateful to everyone in this subreddit for the solidarity and knowledge that is constantly being shared.

I’m in a tough spot with my health and am really just looking for anyone who can relate or point me in a different direction, thanks for reading.

After I got my first IUD implanted in Dec 2023, I have been experiencing complex chronic yeast infections. I was treated with Miconazole and eventually fluconazole(Diflucan) by practitioners at my Planned Parenthood. My yeast infections would come back after about two weeks so I decided to have my IUD removed and to go back to only having sex with condoms with my partner. We are only sexually active after I have recovered from an infection. 

My yeast kept coming back, and I was eventually put on a regimen of oral fluconazole one day a week for 6 months. During this time, I had no yeast infections. Toward the end of the 6months, and this is still happening, I get vulvar itching at night/early morning which goes away after an hour of being up and moving. 

My 6month regimen ended November 2024, and about a month later I got my first yeast infection since the treatment. I went back in to the nurse I was seeing and brought up all my questions but was ultimately just put on another 6months regimen of fluconazole and referred to a specialist. As of today, that specialist has rejected my referral as I am “out of their scope”. Where I live I am also in a bit of a “healthcare desert”. 

I am super scared to go off of fluconazole again but I also feel like I am just postponing the inevitable by being on it. It is certainly curbing my infections but I dont know that it helps my flora for the future. I also am losing my mind a bit over this separate nightly vulvar itching. 

I only wear cotton underwear, I shower daily with no soap down there, I change often, I sleep commando, I take a daily probiotic, I am active, I hydrate well, and I eat a plant based diet and try to limit processed/sugary foods. I have stopped drinking alcohol this year and I also stopped drinking coffee. I stopped smoking weed regularly. Before my IUD, I literally never had any issues with my vagina and have never had a yeast infection or BV. I have negative tested for bv, STDs, and mycoplasma. I don’t have a PCP but I’m trying to find one. I’ve also treated my circumsized partner for yeast with diflucan. I’ve tried boric acid but it was extremely irritating on my body and didn’t help. 

If you have experienced something similar, or have any answers, or recommendations of Drs. near the Seattle area (not where I live but I am willing to travel), please please reach out. I don’t know anyone who has experienced this and no one, including myself, seems to know what to do. 

thank you!",1,1737655285.0,Healthyhooha,0,1.0,False
1i89ir1,https://www.reddit.com/r/KNOXVILLEOPENFORUM/comments/1i89ir1/well_its_certainly_been_an_interesting_year_so_far/,"Well, it's certainly been an interesting year so far........","I came down the mountain with my tail between my legs right after Thanksgiving. Despite working toward the goal of being able to spend the winter off the grid, I was nowhere close. I figured, ah, what the hell, I'll just play bridge as hard as I can and focus and see what happens. Promptly got blackballed. I'm still not sure what the hell even happened. But, that idea was shot down day one.

I'd hooked up with my oldest best friend again, a lifelong relationship that has taken intermittent breaks of up to a decade. His wife was passing through to help with the horse caravans take supplies to the flood victims in North Carolina. She was an on ground volunteer. You don't think about volunteering for this kind of disaster relief as ongoing, but it is and the longer something goes on, the harder it is to get volunteers. So there was plenty of work and Bonnie was spending her early retirement years doing something she valued. Paul is an usher at the VIP elevator in Lambeau Stadium. It's a dream job. Paul and I went off to Lambeau on a vacation a couple years ago and ended up at Shenanigans, Fuzzy Thurston's old bar and the gossip surrounding the quarterback was absolutely bizarre. Seems like there was a limo driver that heard it all. In reality, nobody liked Lindy Infante's offense.  There's nothing like gossip in a Wisconsin dive. Except maybe a meat raffle.

So as a result of boredom more than anything, but inspired by Bonnie's volunteer effort (We were all raised Lutheran. More on that later) decided to take some coffee to the Methodists for their warming center. I would have taken it to the Lutherans if they were doing anything, but they weren't. They did open their doors for the election public forums, but not this. They didn't give us coffee though, which I would have gladly brought. Plus somebody had published a wish list for the warming centers and staying home with a fire is easy on the budget and we'd already paid for the room to meet Paul and Bonnie at Ft. Walton Beach this past weekend. We'd talked about staying til Wednesday, if we had, we'd still be there now. I did get pictures of their snow plows to to show I'm not the ignorant fool and liar Glenn Jacobs people keep trying to make me out to be. Other communities DO respond to emergency weather conditions with rentals and planning, two things we still don't do. Well, there was a plan, but it was only a plan for about half the days we've had so far.

So, I'm at Costco, pulling stuff from the wish list and taking it to Magnolia Avenue United Methodist Church (UMC). Now, I'm not Methodist and I no longer do church. To me, church is a place of philosophical, intellectual and spiritual community. Most churches want buy-in rather than exploration of philosophical and intellectual aspects and they're just not for me. Trout fishing does that for me. So, I'm pulling my donation, really just killing time until the roads back up to Green Cove and my place melt, spending money I couldn't fish with anyway, and it occurred to me that what was being attempted, even at this relatively small level, was an expensive, labor intensive endeavor. Opening a warming center is not a cheap endeavor to be taken lightly.

So I go to Magnolia Ave. UMC (2700 East Magnolia Ave. Knoxville, Tn. 37914) to drop off the supplies. I met a couple folks that were helping. This was right around the 3rd, as I recall, and everyone, including me, seemed to think this would be in the rear view mirror in a couple weeks. It was before anything hit the fan. The goal was no deaths, and everyone thought that was attainable, best I could tell. Three weeks later, we're looking forward to seasonably cold weather, which is what we were preparing for to begin with. We've lost three people. Three human beings to a diverse set of circumstances. And instead of recognizing and coming up with short term solutions to these circumstances, the way we as a community are responding involves either denial or blame. Neither of those approaches solves problems.

As a result of my first trip to Magnolia Ave UMC, I made it a point to take  study to the weather response plan, something I'd researched rather deeply after last year, as it related to warming the homeless during subfreezing weather events. As it turns out, when you plan for normal weather and normal deviations, when a record cold spell hits the plan is inadequate. Go figure. Regardless of other flaws and inadequacies, the plan's scope and needs were always going to be inadequate. That's how these things work. In specific areas of planning, these inadequacies can prove to be dramatic. They can expose errors rather quickly. In the case of this plan, it only went to the point of a State of Emergency, at which point there seems to have been some sort of presumption that the resources freed to whoever was in charge of that emergency response would be used to lesson the effects of the emergency. That power lies in the office of the County Mayor. That help never came. That's how this chain of command works. Blame who you want.

My second trip, I asked if either Tim or Kecia was there. Kecia had sent me a friend request, presumably because of my work. I was quite honored. Tim is sort of a whirling dervish, and as a result of pure chance met me and showed me around. First off, I couldn't believe they were pulling off this task. I'm asking questions and he's shooting answers from the hip and he doesn't even have a working heating unit and I'm staring at a half million to get it started restoration job and it occurred to me that if we wanted this guy and gal to operate in our community, and we do, believe me, we should get them some resources. They're mentoring and providing training to young folks. They're helping people that would be falling through the cracks. Plus, operational basics you need to run a church with that sort of mission. They need bathroom upgrades, including another couple showers. They are emergency response front liners. There is but one rule, keep the peace. It's a sanctuary of God and that is the human condition upon entry. Seemed like a pretty good idea to me, I was surprised I'd never heard it before. They need a laundry room. No telling what kind of shape the roof is in or what the utility bill will be. They have , and need, a commercial kitchen. They will cook whatever food they have with whatever trained volunteers they have. But, having worked in a commercial kitchen 50 years ago, I was concerned about how familiar all the equipment seemed to look. I have no idea what that kind of upgrade costs. So I asked Tim how much money he needed and he started talking about a heater and I asked if a half a million would get him started and he said yes and that's what I'm doing here. Honestly, he probably needs three times that, but he strikes me as resourceful, and I did spend 26 years learning to size people up in less than 15 seconds. You'd be surprised how good I am at it.

So I head out thinking, once again, who could possibly be against this? It's like I think I'm living in a Voltaire play. Come to find out, everyone wants to decide who should pay for this and who should be in charge, and everyone is blaming Indya Kincannan except Tim and Kecia. It's the old Sam Kinison routine but it very much fits a modern ministry. Hungry kid? Do you want to fill out a form or make the kid a sandwich? It's the reality of a ministry with a committed mission in the times we live in. And the reality is, the mission of Magnolia Ave UMC as well as their sister Vestal UMC is expanding. And it's a service mission serving those who might otherwise be alone without help. It's kind of the whole point of the Christian Philosophy, when you get right down to it. But they don't want government money. They are a sanctuary. They don't wish to betray the trust of those they serve. So the donations need to be from the private sector to go to the ministry. What I honestly recommend doing, is buying a giant box of tampons and drop them off for their women's programs and clinics and asking whoever you give them to to answer your questions and show you around. Don't expect details of the operation. Read the audience. I always like to help out or volunteer in person before I jump in whole hog. I suspect quite a few volunteers showed up and were trained. A hope at least some continue. Which brings us back to where do we get a half million seed money?

Us. The community. Historically, the Presbyterians and Methodists pioneered this region, bringing the teachings of Calvin and Wesley to the region. We've always been a stronghold for those community values. As the Baptists became more prominent their outreach extended into the community. There is a reason we became known as volunteers. When we were needed by our people, we responded. I like to think we have some of those values left. So, I'm going to leave this here for now, still not having a clue about raising a half million dollars. How do you raise money that will go directly to helping people these days?

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while drinking tea and having a smoke I’m watching a Dutch streamer play phasmophobia .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
- a lot of random playlist I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings 

**disclaimer**

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )**

Typically, not drinking feels like a real super power (mostly when I compare my life now to my life five years ago, before I first realized that drinking wasn't working for me, and that I needed to stop. I have attempted to quit twice since 2020, each other time going over a year before returning to boozin'). But currently, I just feel so meh about it all. Maybe it's the energy related to the election, and the collective impending doom we're feeling. Maybe it's finally being a full time WFH person. Maybe it's winter. But I just feel so blah about it all. 

However, I do know that not drinking, even on the blah days, is so much better trying to fill my days with the chaos of drinking. I don't miss that. When I used to feel days like this, before I was married and before I was sober, I would finish all my daily tasks and go huddle up to a bar to make some friends and ""really live."" Those days would end with me being wasted, blacked out, drunk and weirding out everyone I know and everyone I didn't know. 

Today, I will finish all my work. I may make another pot of coffee. I may work out (I may not!). I might clean up my messy office. I may watch another two or three episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and eat coconut and dark chocolate candy.

Eight contenders enter the arena. Only one leaves victorious. Let the carnage begin!

**Round 1 – Quarter-Finals**

1. **A Toaster vs. A Raging Squirrel**

The toaster starts off strong, launching flaming crumbs like shrapnel. But the squirrel is fast—dodging, weaving, and then *bam*! It chews through the power cable. The toaster sparks, sputters, and dies.

**Winner: Raging Squirrel**

2. **A Sentient Cup of Coffee vs. A 1997 Nokia 3310**

The coffee tries to scald its opponent, but the Nokia is *indestructible*. The little cup gets a single punch in before the Nokia retaliates by simply existing. The sheer force of its durability causes the coffee to implode.

**Winner: Nokia 3310**

3. **An Angry Goose vs. A Roomba with a Knife Taped to It**

The Roomba circles ominously, its blade glinting. The goose is unimpressed. With a terrifying *honk*, it flaps its wings and kicks the Roomba over. The robot flails helplessly like an overturned turtle. The goose stabs it for good measure.

**Winner: Angry Goose**

4. **Danny DeVito (Wielding a Frying Pan) vs. A Swarm of Bees**

The bees attack in formation. Danny DeVito swings wildly with his frying pan, sending bees flying. But there are too many! In a heroic last stand, he flattens half the swarm before being overwhelmed.

**Winner: Swarm of Bees**



**Semi-Finals**

1. **Raging Squirrel vs. Nokia 3310**

The squirrel scratches, bites, and even tries to *yeet* the phone against a wall. But the Nokia remains unfazed. Eventually, exhausted, the squirrel collapses. The Nokia watches, smugly.

**Winner: Nokia 3310**

2. **Angry Goose vs. Swarm of Bees**

The goose fights valiantly, honking in rage as it slaps bees out of the air. But the bees have numbers, and their stings start taking a toll. Eventually, the goose succumbs to its swollen fate.

**Winner: Swarm of Bees**



**Final Showdown – Nokia 3310 vs. Swarm of Bees**



The bees try everything—stinging, swarming, lifting the Nokia to drop it. But the phone is *eternal*. In a desperate move, the bees combine into a giant fist and attempt to *punch* the Nokia. The phone does not break. Instead, the bees shatter upon impact.



The Nokia stands victorious. The legend lives on.

1i89a8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1i89a8o/i_completely_fixed_my_physical_condition_with/,I completely fixed my physical condition with minimal effort in ~6 months.,"(Hopefully this post is allowed considering this entire subreddit is a Trump-fest)

I'm in my late 20's, and have managed to entirely fix all of my physical ailments in a 6-month stretch through a combination of half-assed exercise and slight changes in food consumption. I basically have been putting in the absolute minimal required amount of effort into my health and feel embarrassed that it has made such a big change.

In 2022, I slipped a disc in my back that basically immobilized me for 2-years. I've been dealing with excruciating pain since then and decided in August that I would take some sort of action to try to fix it. I always failed in the past when I tried to go on restrictive diet/exercise plans and just figured I would take it very easy to start, and figured since my back was so tender, being very gentle could only help.

This is basically all I did:

**Work out:** I work out like twice a week? Sometimes once, sometimes 3 times. I typically do like 1 session of cardio and \~1.5 sessions of weights. I make sure to put in a good effort when I'm there, but I do not have a week-to-week schedule and am not tracking what I'm lifting at all other than by memory. The amount of strength gain and energy I have gained from this is genuinely ridiculous. My back pain is greatly reduced, I sleep better, and I don't wake up in pain. I am starting to gain some very mild muscle definition now, which is encouraging. I started off with strictly cardio in the gym for the first little bit just to get comfortable being in that space.

**Eat better:** I eat bigger meals when I'm hungry. That's basically it. Because I eat big meals, I'm not hungry during the day, don't snack as much, and don't need any sort of extra energy or sugar (soda, candy). I'm sure I eat less overall now, even though I would always eat in smaller quantities before. I usually end up having like 2 meals a day and a small breakfast. I also just don't buy soda or any shit from the grocery store, which makes it very easy to not eat junk at home. I've been putting much less sugar in my coffee now too, which was not a conscious thing. I think I've just been eating less sugar, so my palate has changed a bit?

I went from skinny-fat with a gut to a semi-healthy looking individual in half a year, and it almost happened by accident. Overall, this has been somewhat of an embarrassing experience for me, as I've been scared of exercise for so long (lol). I'm even now getting to the point where tracking my workouts and making a real schedule doesn't feel daunting at all.

I don't have any advice for anybody, but what I will say is that any sort of exercise is better than none. You will be absolutely blown away with what a small amount of discipline will get you.",5,1737654645.0,self,2,0.86,False

I was hoping for some advice relating to discipline while managing a few chronic illnesses.

I have hypothyroidism and anemia, that in turn causes depression and anxiety which can make it hard. It is also possible I have ADHD although I have never been diagnosed (and I’m not exactly self diagnosing), my mom is and I tend to share her same struggles.

Despite this I take thyroid replacement but opted out of mood stabilizers since I’m very sensitive to them and never found one that was best for me. I try to take a holistic approach to everything which is why I’m even posting in the first place, to get started.

To be honest, I have to take medications, multiple supplements and be contentious about what I eat in order to thrive. Issue is I have a hard time with discipline- even if I can envision how good I’d feel and idealize being in top condition I still find myself falling short.

It’s just tedious it feels and hard to remember- I have to take something in the morning and can’t eat or drink anything besides water for 2 hours, then I have to have multiple supplements 3x a day with each meal but at times I’m so busy I don’t get to have the opportunity and end up messing up again.

Because I’m so low energy I self sabotage by grabbing some coffee or a caffeinated tea- which exacerbates both conditions but otherwise I feel like a slug and couldn’t care less because I’m so exhausted. I’m not supposed to have caffeine- I can’t even have caffeinated teas. Doctors orders. Finding replacements and being consistent is hard because it’s such a comfort that’s hard to swap.

I have a hard time getting enough sleep, as I feel my depression makes me try to distract myself and sit on my phone for hours just to get any bit of dopamine- just feels like a waste of a potentially good life and I want to break out of this loop yet discipline is hard.

I feel like a ball bouncing around a small enclosed box that isn’t getting anywhere, just building up energy and becoming restless. I’m gonna say I’m so grateful for my ESA because she helps me keep some sort of consistency and grounding- I love her.

It can make me end up feeling bad because it feels as though I’m doing my body a disservice- which I am! I’m not here to complain, I’m just painting the picture of my own BS and hoping to hear of any methods, inspiration or advice that could streamline things a bit.

Then we (me and my mom) talked about going  at a local Italian restaurant where we are before. K, cool.

 We talked about last Sunday and I got used to the idea just for my mom to call me up right now, telling me she and my dad went there last night and didn't have a great experience. Mind you when we where there last time it was all fine and when my mom was there for her sister's birthday she didn't complain either. She told me that she and my don't want to go there on Saturday because apparently they were freezing and there food took too long and was burned. She asked me if I want to eat at a different restaurant which I don't. I don't want go out to a restaurant on birthday where I have never been before in case it is shit. And than my mom also revealed that my dad's aunt and cousin would be there as well, they are currently staying with my grandma because of someone else's birthday and basically invited themselves to my birthday as well. My dad's cousin is disabled so it's not his fault but still my dad's aunt is known to invite herself, especially if there is free food involved. 

I was livid on the phone with my mom changing plans two days before my birthday. My mom offered to cook herself which I don't want because I don't want her to have to ""work"" on my birthday. I told her upset I was by all of this but she essentially told me to ""suck it up"" and ""to make the best of it"".

1i891o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamblingRecovery/comments/1i891o1/a_letter_to_my_parents_a_read/,A letter to my parents (a read),"**Origin**  
It started when I was 11-12 years old with FIFA. I was addicted to that game, but not to playing soccer, but to opening the little packs. I remember I would get the packs on Thursday, and for me, it was everything. I couldn’t wait each week for Thursday to come—I’d count the days and hours like a kid who’s about to go on a trip. Opening the packs takes 2 minutes, and for any normal person, the goal is to open them to put the players you get in your team and play better at soccer. For me, it wasn’t that simple. I turned it into a whole ritual. I opened each pack, player by player, to add more suspense and excitement. I would reveal each attribute individually and try to guess which player I had gotten.

After the 30 minutes it took me to open the packs, I didn’t put those players in my team—I sold them to buy more packs. It didn’t matter which player I got; my goal wasn’t the same as my friends’, no matter how much I wanted to make it seem like it was. Deep down, without realizing it, I didn’t want to play with Messi or Ronaldo—I wanted to open more packs.

“It’s just FIFA,” I thought. It’s not real money, and the only thing you can lose are virtual players. But little by little, it started taking on a bigger role in my life. Waiting for Thursday became very hard—I wanted to open packs more often. If $20 crossed my path, I would spend it hoping to get a valuable player I could sell and improve my team. But even when that happened, within 2 or 3 days, I’d end up selling everything to buy more packs.

It got to the point where I always had in mind that Friday and Saturday nights, Walgreens closed at midnight. I’d leave hangouts early, and with whatever money I had left over from the weekend, I’d ask the Uber driver or whoever gave me a ride to stop so I could buy gift cards and open more packs.

Something that started so innocently, over time, took over my brain. My mood depended on what I got in the packs. I could be in a good mood or a bad mood because of a virtual player. It showed in almost all aspects—whether I wanted to talk, socialize, exercise, work hard on assignments, or spend time with you all… Everything depended on what was happening in FIFA.

One day, like any kid, I grew up and stopped playing PlayStation. My friends stopped playing, and it no longer made sense to have a great team or the best player because I couldn’t show it off to anyone. However, even though I stopped playing FIFA, I didn’t stop that pattern of thought that was already engraved in me. I didn’t stop those habits or that chemical cocktail my brain felt when opening a pack.

I spent many years feeding a monster that could devour me at any moment.

**The Monster**  
The first time I entered a casino was in the summer of 2021 in Vallarta. I took 1,000 pesos, and I lost it in about 30 minutes, but I felt something I had never felt before. It was like opening 100 packs at once. Without realizing it, I started petting the monster.

It takes time; it doesn’t happen overnight. But little by little, the monster began to move. One thing led to another, and before I knew it, I had an online casino account. If I got 70 for gas, I would put in 50 and deposit the other 20. If I got money to go out, I’d say it cost “x” amount when it actually cost 50 less. If we went out to eat and pops gave me 50, it was the same story.

Unlike others, I didn’t get hooked by a win. I spent months without any significant prize. Like with the packs, I did it simply for the act of opening the pack. If I got stressed at school, I’d think, “Well, if I deposit, I can entertain myself for an hour and not think about school.” If a girl didn’t pay attention to me, I’d deposit and play to distract myself and stop thinking about it. If I didn’t like my major and was feeling down, I did the same thing…

In the end, the tables turned. I was stressed at school, girls didn’t pay attention to me, or I didn’t like my major because my mind was trapped in the game.

When the card is about to be flipped, the ball is about to stop, or the pack is about to be opened, everything stops. Time freezes, and so do my problems. A black hole I could escape to forget everything. Its admission ticket cost just 20 bucks—or so it seemed.

**Powder**  
When you don’t have money in your bank account, it’s hard to gamble. You have to go deposit cash, and once you lose it, it’s over. I couldn’t justify leaving the house at 10 p.m.

Money for a gambler is like powder for a drug addict. You can’t put that white powder in front of them because they’ll snort it. I realized this last August. my first  paycheck lasted me 2 days. I started by depositing 20, but when I lost it, I had immediate access to more, something I’d never had before.

“One more…” And one more… Until I opened my eyes and had nothing left.

I felt a shame I had never felt before; I was disgusted with myself. After working every day for two weeks, my reward had been reduced to zero. I swore to myself that I would never do it again, but the monster was already controlling my brain at its will—I had given it too much power.

Paycheck after paycheck, the same thing happened. No matter how hard I tried to stop, it was impossible for me. Just as an alcoholic can’t stop after their first drink, it became impossible for me to stop after placing my first bet. Online casinos aren’t foolish—they give you free money daily so you’ll gamble. They make you dip your feet into a hot jacuzzi on a cold day, put a chip in your mouth, they give an alcoholic their first zip.

**More Powder**  
One day in October, I had my first big win. With a 2-dollar bet, I won 4k. I swore it was the end. I finally had more money than I had ever worked for.

But the monster doesn’t die with money. On the contrary, the more money it has, the louder it roars. Without realizing it, I still had no control over my thoughts. If my average bet was 2 dollars, now with 4k in the bank, it didn’t bring me the same pleasure. It works just like everything else—the more you consume, the less it satisfies you. Little by little, I increased my deposits until, inevitably, on my birthday, I lost it all. There I was, with confetti on my head, cutting the cake with my grandparents, pretending everything was fine, just hours after losing the 1.5k I had left.

This had become a habit in my life—a false life of pretending and acting. A life of mistrusting myself, of shame, of desperation. The hole I had fallen into no longer had light.

The monster had grown so large that it needed to eat, and I no longer had a way to feed it. But it, like any great animal, smells blood and finds it. So blinded and without reason, I sold my PlayStation, my old iPad, and what hurts the most—my gold coin.

In December, the monster found a Michelin-star buffet. With the money from the coin (1k), I managed to reach 9k. After everything I had experienced, it’s illogical that I didn’t exclude myself from all casinos at that moment. I should have stopped there. But just like in FIFA, I didn’t open the packs for the players, and I didn’t gamble for the money. No matter how much I won, it was never enough. No matter how much I lost, it was always too much. I am convinced that I could have reached a million and still never stopped.

**Money**  
It’s funny—money seemed like everything and nothing while I was playing. It was everything I wanted: I craved it more than my family, my friends, my hobbies, my health, my career… but it was worth nothing when I clicked to spin or placed the chips on the table.

You see, it was never about the money.  
“I’ll win it back and then I’ll stop…” That will never happen, because what I really want back is that dopamine rush, my brain wanted more of that cocktail, not a piece of paper or a number in a bank account. It was never about that.

It’s impossible for me to know what a dollar is worth after playing $100 hands and betting thousands of dollars per week. Even though money has nothing to do with effort or work for me, the monster has made me believe it’s my only source of happiness and joy.

I know that true happiness lies in enjoying a good meal, a good coffee, being in the company of friends, my family, achievements in my career, having good relationships, good health, being close to God…  It will be difficult for me to find joy in those things again after frying my brain the way I did.

I trust that it will get better with time.

**The End**  
I’m ashamed, regretful, disgusted—use whatever adjective you want. In the end, this has been a very dark period of my life, one I never want to return to. It has ruined me more than you can imagine. It’s not just the money; it’s the time, the hobbies, the relationships, the friends, the family…

Today, I am truly willing to do whatever it takes—give you my bank accounts, have my expenses monitored, go to therapy, join groups, etc. I know it’s harder from a distance, but for that very reason, I’ve learned that this is something bigger than me, and I can’t do it alone.

I could’ve kept pops $3,000 gift from the beginning and just lived off my salary, but who am I kidding? I know I would’ve found a million excuses to gamble: feeling lonely, being nervous, having a bad day at work… That’s the reactive mechanism I currently have for any negative emotion. I need to share this with you because I can’t do it alone.

I want to change so I can go back to living. As I said, the money isn’t even half the problem. When was the last time I went to play tennis? Or golf? When was the last relationship I formed? The last skill I developed? The last conversation I truly cared about?

It’s an infinite hole with no bottom. If I had never looked up, I could have fallen forever—owing people money, betraying my family's business… Thankfully, I never reached that point and am allowing myself to be helped before it’s too late.

I want you to understand that I will do my part because I’m tired of the life I’ve gotten myself into. But I also want to tell you that this monster hasn’t left me. No matter how much I reason, the monster can roar and devour me again at any moment.

I’ve been attending online therapy, and Nathan told me I would never leave this behind unless I told you all. And I believe him. The monster dies with light, not with willpower alone. It’s a cycle designed for me to lie, hide, and isolate myself. I trust that if I stop lying, hiding, and isolating myself, it will be much easier to suffocate it.

**Reflection -** *inspired by Fred Again & Stephen Colbert*  
It is a gift to exist, and with existence comes suffering. There is no way to escape it. I dont wish this had ever happened. I wish it had never happened, but If i'm grateful for my life (which I think is something positive—not everyone feels that way, and I haven’t always felt that way, but it’s the most positive thing I can do). I have to be grateful for all of it. I can’t pick and choose what im grateful for.

What do I take away from this experience? I take with me an awareness of others’ suffering, which helps me understand them better, connect with them more deeply, be more vulnerable, and understand what it means to be human.

I want the fact that I suffered from this at a young age to help me understand that everyone suffers from something. And no matter how imperfect it is, I want it to help me understand and connect with them—whether it’s with my partner, my children, or you all—and love them in a deep way that not only accepts that we all suffer but also makes me feel grateful for the fact that i have suffered.

It’s about the fullness of my humanity. What’s the point of being here and being human if I can’t be the most human I can be? And that means recognizing, and ultimately being grateful for the things I wish had never happened.",2,1737654034.0,GamblingRecovery,0,1.0,False

Overpriced coffee is an entertaining internet rabbit hole to fall into if you fancy yourself a caffeine enthusiast. Some types of coffee can be extremely rare and, as a result, quite costly, which leaves coffee lovers from all around the world at awe.

A curious customer [entered a cozy coffee shop](https://mexoshop.com/collections/coffee-cup) with no freshwater on a busy city street in hopes of finding something different. The barista was an expert when it came to rare and most expensive coffees. So he smiled at the customer, welcomed him, and suggested a cup of Hacienda La Esmeralda, which is one of those who are being chased all around the planet.

* A veritable fest of jasmine + bergamot + honey mingled and gyrated upon the customer’s tongue when they took their first sip. The smell of it filled the air and attracted another customer that wanted to know what smelled so good.
* Word spread quickly about the delightful coffee being served in tiny cups at the rundown spot. Soon, aficionados were making a sort of pilgrimage to taste the coffee, considered too good for even the finest places. As demand for the rare coffee grew, the shop transformed into a Mecca for those seeking the ultimate coffee experience.
* It was over multiple cups of the Hacienda La Esmeralda that friends sipped and tasted together with others. which cultivated an appreciation for how art and craftsmanship had put this extravagant coffee on their templates. Finally, the once humble coffee shop was reborn a sanctuary for those in with the know and a fervent appreciation of great coffee.
* I think the real enchantment of coffee lies in its myriad flavors and that every cup has a story to tell. From whence it came, how it was grown and roasted each telling part of the tale. Sarah is a coffee expert.

Sarah says to embrace taking a chance on exotic choices of coffee beans, “don’t be scared.” You might even start to appreciate the intricacies and skill involved in every cup.

#  History of expensive coffee

Expensive Coffee: The history of expensive coffee traces its lineage back all the way to the Old World, when coffee actually existed in Ethiopia’s verdant forests. In the legend, a goat herder named Kaldi discovered that after munching on coffee cherries, his goats became energetic. It was from this serendipitous discovery that coffee, a beloved beverage, originated.

Due to its stimulating properties, coffee quickly spread through Arabia and became an integral part of their culture. The Arabs established coffeehouses as places where people could gather and discuss various topics. In the 17th century, coffee made its way from the Arab regions to Europe, where it was favored by the wealthy and intellectual classes. This also marked the beginning of the first coffeehouses in major European cities, with Fair Trade Coffee becoming a key element in the coffee culture.

Java, Jamaica Colombia are but a few examples of the expansion of coffee plantations worldwide due to global demand. These regions birthed unique coffee varieties with a taste and aroma like no other, cementing the foundation of gourmet coffee.

The chase for specialty coffee has expanded into a hunt for precious beans grown in wild and cumbersome locations. True coffee lovers go after rare types like Geisha Coffee from Panama or coffee Luwak from Indonesia. Which are reputed to be amazingly delicious and not so often seen in the general market.

This highlights the timeless appeal of coffee and how only dedicated professionals can produce the very best. Each cup of expensive coffee tells a story, blending craftsmanship and art. It’s a testament to tradition and precision, refined over time, to create a perfect sip for those who truly appreciate this experience.

# Factors that contribute to the high cost of coffee: 



Coffee bean cost is not the only thing that drives coffee prices so high. These reasons explain why some coffees cost more than others and are important to understand if you want to grasp how coffee at the broader scale of the industry functions. Below, we break down the high price of coffee into a variety of factors.

 **1. Unique Origins:** Beans harvested from rare or small production regions also tend to go for more money due to their scarcity.

**2. Unique Processing Methods:** Unique Processing Methods Aging or fermenting coffee beans is an age-old art, and it can add a lot to the value of your product.

**3. Labor-Intensive Harvesting :** The expenses incurred by labor make manual processing of coffee beans high-cost.

**4. Bean Grade:** Better beans have a higher station’s cupping score (the tasting done after drying and cleaning of the cherries).

**5. Ethically Sourced :** Coffee with fair trade, organic or other sustainability certifications may have higher prices.

**6. Popularity:** Coffee from well-known roasters or regions often comes with a higher price, largely because of the brand’s popularity.

**7. Limited Volume:** Certain coffees are expensive because they can only be harvested in limited quantities or are naturally seasonal.

**8. Transportation:** If the coffee beans you are purchasing come in from a remote region or if they need to be choppered out of the rugged terrain, these costs will eventually raise your price.

Why The Price Of Coffee Beans Can Differ These all impact the pricing of coffee, which is why certain beans on the market are more expensive than others.

# Geographical regions are renowned for producing expensive coffee :



Several countries are renowned for producing some of the most expensive and sought-after coffee beans. These regions are revered for their cultivation practices and ideal environments, which are unmatched elsewhere. Some of the most expensive coffee beans come from these key countries and regions.

* **Ethiopia:**
   * **Yirgache:** The most likely contender to exhibit an amazing flavor profile that includes floral and fruity notes. [This is one variety of Ethiopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Ethiopia) Yirgacheffe coffee with delicate complexity.
   * **Sidamo:** This widely respected region in Sidamo is home to coffees with high acidity, floral scents and beautiful bodies—prized by coffee snobs everywhere.

* **Jamaica (Blue Mountain):**
   * Blue Mountains: Blue Mountains, Jamaica The Blue Mountain region in Jamaica is responsible for some of the highest and most expensive Jamaican coffee beans you could ever find anywhere on Earth. Beans from this region have a smooth mild flavor and combined with medium body, balanced acidity, they form full bodied coffee.

* **Hawaii (Kona):**
   * **Kona:** In Hawaii, the Kona region of the islands is famous for its delicious and robust tasting Kona coffee. This coffe is grown in the rich volcanic soil of Kona and has a smooth, deep flavor profile with hints of nuttiness and chocolate.

* **Panama (Boquete):**
   * **Boquete :** Boquete is known as a place that grows some of the world’s most expensive and coveted caffeinated berries. Which includes the Geisha variety that ensures its high price. Boquete coffees, with their outstanding flavor, floral fragrance, and terrific balance of fresh sweetness, are among the most expensive coffees available.

* **Indonesia (Sumatra):**
   * **Indonesia:** With coffee types like Mandheling and Gayo, Indonesia is recognized for its full-bodied selection of coffees with very low acidity levels supported by earthy as well as spicy undertones. These unique traits make Sumatran coffees some of the priciest options available and, in terms, boost their popularity.

There are many places all around the world that have a great reputation for producing coffee beans. The climate of each region and the soil conditions specific to growing coffee have created a regional reputation for quality. That now demands premium pricing in international markets.

# Unique processing methods:



The singular process employed makes expensive coffee beans cost so much. There are different special techniques, and each takes a certain number of steps with the goal of bringing more flavor characteristics into coffee. How these methods of persuasion are contributing to the premium pricing:

**1. Natural Process:** When coffee beans are dried, they take in fruity flavors, leading to a richer and more fruity taste.

**2. Washed Processing:** This method involves removing the coffee cherries before drying. Which gives the coffee a clean taste with a high acidity flavor profile.

**3. Honey processing :** As a midpoint between natural and washed, the beans are only de-pulped partially to then be dried with all or some of their fruit, allowing for sweetness, body & mouthfeel.

**4. Exclusive Flavors:** Anaerobic fermentation means that the beans are fermented with little to no oxygen, allowing them to produce unique flavors and intensities, thereby making your coffee is more expensive.

**5. Extended Fermentation:** Because the beans ferment for an extended amount of time, they are more complex and have a deeper flavor profile, which typically makes them pricier.

**6. Ageing:** Aged green coffee is tasted three times: with sparkling water, hot, and at room temperature, before being cupped or sent to the roastery. This aging process, done after harvest and during transport, helps develop unique flavors, but not all beans should be aged.

**7.Roasting Methods:**  Unconventional roasting methods contribute to the high price of some coffees. For instance, some premium coffees are roasted over wood fires or sun-roasted on clay patios.

These nontraditional methods develop unique flavors and complexities in the coffee. They require intricate processing techniques, time, and expertise. This meticulous approach results in coffee beans with specific and distinctive taste characteristics, which is why they command a premium price.

# The importance of rarity in pricing :

In the market, different prices are to some extent determined by how rare it is coffees. This is the way rarity impacts the valuation of coffee.

1. **Increased Demand & Limited Supply:** You’ll soon notice that some beans are harder for buyers to find. Beans from rare varieties or unique regions are in limited supply because they need very specific soil and often thrive only in certain seasons or locations. This rarity makes these coffees highly sought after, driving up their price.

**2. Uniqueness:** coffee lovers and connoisseurs of collections take pleasure in discovering the [unique flavors from rare coffee bean types.](https://gomehedi.com/best-flavored-coffee/) This exclusivity, whether due to origin or processing method (or both), is part of the reason these beans come at a premium.

**3. It is planted in very special circumstances:** unlike common coffee types, some varieties need a particular cultivation method or specific climatic conditions to succeed. The cost of these beans is higher due to the lot their shareholders invest in growing their unique crops.

**4. Demand :** Ultimately, the rarer coffee varieties are ones that have high demand from consumers who seek after these beans for their exclusivity and quality. The limited availability of these rare coffees is only increasing customer interest.

**5. High Flavor and Quality:** Many of the world award winners are some sort of rare coffee because their flavor profile is exceptional along with quality. Since these beans are so rare, drinkers are required to pay a premium price in order to enjoy the distinctive and unforgettable taste.

**6. Top Cup Scores:** Certified coffees that rate highest in blind cupping for aroma, taste, and other quality characteristics are deemed premium. Rarest beans with the best cupping scores and thus come at a price, which you will pay for high-quality coffee.

In summary, the value of certain coffee varieties is largely due to their rarity and exclusivity. Factors such as limited supply, high demand, and challenging or costly production requirements contribute to their high worth. 

Unique characteristics and flavors found only in these rare coffees further enhance their appeal. These elements combine to make these exceptional coffees highly sought after compared to standard varieties.

# How does demand affect pricing?



**High Demand:** If people begin craving a particular kind of luxury coffee, the price for that will rise exponentially as well. Market forces may drive the price up for some breeds because demand is high.

**Rare:** Luxury coffees that are hard to come by or only available in limited quantities, can lead others who cannot get their hands on the exclusive treat to start clamoring for it. And the limited availability can only push prices up.

**Brand Image:** Many luxury coffee brands have a well-earned reputation for upholding quality and exclusivity. Those brands that are in demand cause their prices to soar since people pay for the name and experience.

**Exotics Flavors:** Luxury coffees may also have exotic, hard-to-find flavors that will attract coffee lovers. People want to create this, so because of their demand, these coffees could be sold at a high price!

**Fashionable Varieties:** the development of espresso traits can also all together affect demand. Since it is a luxury coffee, if it becomes trendy for any particular reason, then more people will start desiring to drink that coffee. which in turn makes the price go up because of higher demand.

Finally, the cost of luxury coffees is influenced by consumer demand. It incorporates the high demand price that people will pay a premium for if they love one single coffee, need it, and are willing to spend at this level of availability.

# Experiences of tasting expensive coffee:



As you sip the coffee, which costs a pretty penny more than most other options, it should feel exclusive and surprisingly high-class! Rich people’s coffee taste is owed to the following key features:.

Top-grade beans : Most of the high-quality, expensive coffees are crafted from carefully selected and processed premium grade coffee beans. This is reflected in a more delicate, varied flavor of the coffee because of the superior bean Q grade.

Unique Region: Premium coffee often comes from select regions or microclimates that give the beans distinct flavors. It happens in unique terroirs and gives the coffee its complexity as well as a bit of depth.

Special Processes: More expensive coffees are more likely to be produced by special processing techniques like natural, washed or anaerobic fermentation. In the daytime, Robusta beans get treated to augments in flavor and scent that give them breath of nuance.

Rich Aroma and Complexity: The aroma present in costly coffee is truly wonderful and provides a sensual appeal. With its floral, fruity with chocolate and nutty overtones—complicated but really flavorful notes that enrich the coffee.

Acidity and Balance: The acidity in premium grade coffee is usually a clear, balanced acid that functions as an additional flavor to the bean. The acidity of cheap coffee is commonly high and sharp, which tends to be a great point (for the cost) because it brings brightness in your brew.

Rich and Creamy Mouth Feel: An expensive cup of coffee is sought after because it leaves that luxurious feeling with a beautifully smooth sensation as you drink too. These coffees have an almost languid, silky texture and are soft on the drinking palate.

Delicate Notes: Those little hints of flavours that slowly bloom on your palate, you should anticipate to taste from a higher end coffee. The complex flavor notes slowly reveal themselves, each with their own layer of depth and refinement.

Conclusion: Expensive coffee tastes unique because this aroma plays a crucial part in aesthetics, which distinguishes the origin of coffee beans and their processing methods as well. 

# Sustainability and ethical implications of expensive coffee production:



That being said, growing expensive coffee beans comes in both ethical ways and sustainability vibes to protect the livelihoods of farmers while also keeping an eye on our planet, as well as protecting something that we all truly love—a good cup (or five…who am I trying to kid) of strong & flavours some filtered-brewed black liquid. Here are the lessons by app that I have drawn from these points:

* **Fair Wages for Farmers:**
   * It can be used to pay fair wages on its own or coupled with others as a means of ensuring that coffee farmers are provided for and amply compensated.

* **Environmental Conservation:**
   * Just some of the practices around responsible sourcing by niche brands include ecosystem-friendly shade-grown cultivation, organic farming methods and advanced water conservation.

* **Community empowerment:**
   * So besides providing quality coffee beans, support social projects and approaches to the community in coffee origin.

* **Certifications:**
   * There are different labels and certifications of luxury coffee beans, such as Fair Trade and Rainforest Alliance Organic, that reflect their common production.

*  **Biodiversity Preservation:**
   * Biodiversity Conservation: Luxury coffee farms often maintain a wide range of ecosystems and plant shade trees that preserve natural wildlife habitats.

* **Quality over Quantity:**
   * There are a number of companies that still choose to do things right, and they work on small scale releases with the most premium beans, taking in all possible care and firing for flavour and sustainability.

*  **Transparent supply chains:**
   * Whereas ethical luxury coffee brands tend to keep a transparent supply chain so that consumers can trace the origins of their purchase and understand what effect this has.

Through ethical and sustainable practices such as these, luxury coffee producers can uphold their social responsibility to environmental stewardship in the pursuit of a more conscientious way of producing premium quality products that are here for the long haul.

Here's an example where we define two tables \`Employees\` and \`Products\` and we return the number of employees in the IT department using `COUNTIF(Employees(""Department""), ""IT"")`:

    =LET(
      TABLE, LAMBDA(array,
        LAMBDA([label],
          IF(ISOMITTED(label), array,

This works by defining a function `TABLE(array)` that returns a function `<TableName>([label])` (thanks to u/AdministrativeGift15 for the insight) where `<TableName>` is the name we assigned to the table using `LET` and `[label]` is an optional parameter used to return the corresponding column from `array`. If it's omitted — for example,`Employees()` — the function returns the whole table.

The function `TABLE` could be extended to work with more than one column. This formula for instance returns the `ProductName` and `StockQuantity` columns from the \`Products\` table using `Products(""ProductName, StockQuantity"")`:

    =LET(
      TABLE, LAMBDA(array,
        LAMBDA([label],
          IF(ISOMITTED(label), array,
            LET(
              labels, TRIM(TEXTSPLIT(label, "","")),
              columns, XMATCH(labels, TAKE(array, 1)),
              IF(
               OR(ISERROR(columns)),
               ""No column"" & IF(SUM(--ISERROR(columns)) > 1, ""s"", """") & "" `"" & TEXTJOIN(""`, `"", 1, FILTER(labels, ISERROR(columns))) & ""`"",
               INDEX(array, SEQUENCE(ROWS(array)), columns)
              )
            )
          )
        )
      ),
      Employees, TABLE(A1:E8), Products, TABLE(A10:E17),
      Products(""ProductName, StockQuantity"")
     )

However, this updated function has the downside that the returned array is no longer a reference, even if the input to `TABLE` is a reference, so functions like `COUNTIF` will not work.",3,1737653996.0,excel,1,1.0,False

I was hoping for some advice relating to discipline while managing a few chronic illnesses.

I have hypothyroidism and anemia, that in turn causes depression and anxiety which can make it hard. It is also possible I have ADHD although I have never been diagnosed (and I’m not exactly self diagnosing), my mom is and I tend to share her same struggles.

Despite this I take thyroid replacement but opted out of mood stabilizers since I’m very sensitive to them and never found one that was best for me. I try to take a holistic approach to everything which is why I’m even posting in the first place, to get started.

To be honest, I have to take medications, multiple supplements and be contentious about what I eat in order to thrive. Issue is I have a hard time with discipline- even if I can envision how good I’d feel and idealize being in top condition I still find myself falling short.

It’s just tedious it feels and hard to remember- I have to take something in the morning and can’t eat or drink anything besides water for 2 hours, then I have to have multiple supplements 3x a day with each meal but at times I’m so busy I don’t get to have the opportunity and end up messing up again.

Because I’m so low energy I self sabotage by grabbing some coffee or a caffeinated tea- which exacerbates both conditions but otherwise I feel like a slug and couldn’t care less because I’m so exhausted. I’m not supposed to have caffeine- I can’t even have caffeinated teas. Doctors orders. Finding replacements and being consistent is hard because it’s such a comfort that’s hard to swap.

I have a hard time getting enough sleep, as I feel my depression makes me try to distract myself and sit on my phone for hours just to get any bit of dopamine- just feels like a waste of a potentially good life and I want to break out of this loop yet discipline is hard.

I feel like a ball bouncing around a small enclosed box that isn’t getting anywhere, just building up energy and becoming restless. Sick of the cycle.

It can make me end up feeling bad because it feels as though I’m doing my body a disservice- which I am! I’m not here to complain, I’m just painting the picture of my own BS and hoping to hear of any methods, inspiration or advice that could streamline things a bit.",1,1737653580.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

As i walked in the door he called out from the kitchen, asking if I wanted a breakfast burrito. I said sure. He paused like this wasn't the answer he expected, and then said, okay, we only have one tortilla, so half of this is yours!  

I walked over and looked at it - reader, it was a fried egg on a tortilla, that's it.  I said, oh, thanks, I'll get something else. He got INDIGNANT, said he had just made it for me and it was ungrateful to say I didn't want it now. Okay, he said that with his eyes, but still. I gently tried again, saying I was good with coffee this morning. He kept pressuring me to eat ""my half"" the ""burrito"". I wondered how one even does that - how do you bite into a fried egg you are holding in your hand and then transfer it to another person? I said it isn't shareable. He got huffy and said I shouldn't have said I wanted it, and now it's cooled off and no one is excited to eat it so the joy of a home cook breakfast is wasted along with the food.

1i88tu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1i88tu4/music_art_emotions_and_the_connections_between/,"Music, Art, Emotions, and the Connections between People: 1.5's Special Episode and how it relates to ZZZ's themes","So, that new storyline, huh? It's gotten mixed reception, but I think it's really great. Part of the reason why I think it's so great is a bit lost on people I think, because it's not I saw something get a lot of discussion for. This story for me is peak because of how it ties into ZZZ's previously established themes and symbolism in a much more obvious way than the story has been so far (though as you'll see it's always been there) and really ties it all up together. It felt like an epilogue to 1.4 and I really liked that.

So, okay, to explain. While ZZZ is rooted in 90's retro aesthetics with the CRTs and the VHS tapes and whatnot, one major theme that comes up again and again is *music* (art in general, I'll talk more about this later). The items that enhance agents in battle are literally music record CDs, and it's implied that they can play music as well; the energy you spend to perform ultimates is called Decibels, and they also accumulate through performing well in battle (more on this later); the only developer self-insert in this game is San-Z, the game's primary composer who also runs a store that sells music related goods; the Ballet Twins are activated by music, as seen in this Episode and previously in Chapter 3; Anby, the game's mascot, is not only listening to music *in the game's icon*, but she also canonically listens to music in game while fighting, and hums it as her idle; there are not one, not two, but *three* music venues, Starloop Stage, Reverb Arena, and the inaccessible one on Sixth Street; there are several musician NPCs, Astra's face has been plastered everywhere since the game released, there's the idols, Caesar's piano interlude, Billy hyping himself up the Starlight Knight theme, I could keep going and going. Even the game's soundtrack plays on this, there is a very deliberate emphasis on the game's music compared to other miHoYo games, regardless of your own subjective taste, and it's pretty apparent.

While the meaning of this theme becomes evident when you think about it for a moment, it's this story that really makes it obvious. In reality, ZZZ's focus on music, on *art*, is really just a natural extension of its foremost and greatest theme: *emotions* and the *connections between people*

As was previously implied and explicitly stated in this storyline and other side-materials, Ether can be controlled by singing. Why? Because Ether is highly responsive to *human emotions.* Melinoe tells us that Ether has a particular aggression towards, or let's say, *attraction* towards beings that have a ""soul"", or more specifically, beings that have complex emotions, such as intelligent constructs, Thirens, and humans.

Ethereals from people who died with strong feelings carry on these emotions even long after death, sticking strongly to whatever directive they had despite their limited mental faculties. We see this with the Ballet Twins and in Harumasa's quest. We also see how people who suffer from Ether-related conditions, such as Granny Leisha and people afflicted with Harumasa's disease, tend to suffer from emotional instability and other mental issues. Notably, Granny Leisha fixated on a moment of heightened emotion from her past, and had a brief moment of lucidity once she confronted her past traumas and met up again with her ""children"".

Furthermore, let's look at Hollow Zero. Hollow Zero is full of items that tell the stories of people, items of particular emotional significance to these people. Unlike many other physical objects, these items don't degrade as fast when exposed to Ether, as if the strong feelings associated with them give them a degree of protection. Notably this is also something we see in Astra's quest, as Joran's record remained pristine and intact despite having resided in a Hollow for presumably many years.

And then there's the fact that music can manipulate Ether. The reason why this is the case is more or less explained verbatim by Astra and is the thesis statement of the whole story: music, particularly singing, is something which carries abstract emotions, resonating between people, and uniting them across space and time. In other words, if Ether is like water, and emotions are a force that makes it move, then music creates waves that allows it to propagate in specific directions.

This is why we see Astra having trouble keep the thrusters on when singing by herself (especially since her voice is having trouble harmonizing as she's panicking internally), but then when everyone starts singing with her, their collective emotion puts the Ether in the Starloop on overdrive, and that saves them.

More importantly, the reason *why* Astra's music is so powerful is because she's emotionally pure. She doesn't get dominated by disharmonious thoughts and acts wholly as herself, and that in turn inspires others to be true to their feelings. In Yanagi's relationship events, we find out that clarity of emotion is what's truly necessary to sing well, not just technique.

But we've actually seen the concept of music carrying emotion even long before this. There's Yanagi's relationship events of course, but there's also Caesar's teaser with the piano, the concept of a mother's lullaby to her children is a recurring motif, at least two of the Hares finding it important to have hype BGM during combat, the Ballet Twins' music, etc.

And it's not just limited to music, either! *Art* as a whole is seen as a form of transmitting feelings and unifying people, even if music takes a precedence. I mean, for one we run a video store, but also you ever notice how we *always* watch a movie in every Agent's relationship events, and by doing so, we gain more insight into their feelings and personality? New Eridu is *coated* in graffiti and eccentric posters, there are prominent ballet performances, video games through the arcade are also shown as a way for people to bond, art of all kinds carries emotions and thus holds real, *physical* power in ZZZ's world. Ether energy is literally what powers New Eridu!

In the story, when you control Evelyn, you get the opportunity to talk to one of the store owners to determine if they're suspicious or not. They pass Evelyn's evaluation by being passionate about their craft, but I found Tin Master's speech notable. Why? He *hates* it when people use coffee solely as a means of keeping themselves awake. He believes the true magic of coffee is how its aroma, taste, and socializing potential inspires unique feelings in people and connects them together. That's right, even *coffee* holds power in New Eridu.

So, working backwards from that, we can see this principle being applied in almost every aspect of the game's story. For example, when Koleda starts winning after saying Geralt's name, that's not *just* an epic shonen anime moment. Geralt was where Khors's last stand took place, its been living in the Hollow for years, it's the prototype of Belobog's special robots meant to operate well in Ether-filled environments (which is probably why they all have personalities), and during the fight, it was partially corrupted by the Complex. So during Koleda's surge of emotions and memories of her father, there may have been a *literal* powerup.

During Qingyi's quest, the question of Bangboo and machines is brought up. Why are Bangboo and other constructs given emotions, despite only seemingly being tools? And why do humans insist on forming deep connections with them? It's because these robots were made to interface with Ether, and as such benefit from  having complex emotions and identities. Even Fairy has an identity of her own. Phaethon's whole thing is linking up with a Bangboo and their ability to be right there with their agents, up close and personal, is cited as their greatest strength.

Then there's Miyabi's blade. It houses a tremendously powerful Ethereal who explicitly feeds off on and gets stronger by harnessing the grudges and negative experiences of the sword's previous users, and Miyabi was able to overcome it with her own willpower and connections to other people.

You see ghosts and the ""spirit"" (leftover emotions) of deceased individuals constantly influencing the world in both the main story and in sidequests, such as that one girl whose cat turned into a cactus. Oh, and what are the special AI called? Fairy, Ghost, Yokai, Jinn, etc. Spirits, things people worshipped and were afraid of, names which elicit potent imagery in people. 

And this is reflected in the gameplay, too! Why does performance in battle affect Decibel gain? It's the agents building up morale through epic sick trickz, which translates to actual strength. Astra's buffs aren't just her songs being so good they motivate the agents, they're *literally* making them stronger.

Even when the game is not explicitly using this as a worldbuilding device, the theme of emotions and connections is all over the game. Most agents' storylines revolve around the agent sympathizing and forming a connection with someone else, often an NPC whose life story relates to theirs in some way. A significant amount of sidequests revolve around honoring loved ones, tightening bonds between people, and conquering your feelings. The Prophecy literally has characters named after human emotions, and you beat the final boss by making friends with all of them, which you do by understanding their needs. It is very Undertale-y, but I also think that fits with the game's themes. Even the secret ending, where you solo the final boss, ends with you and the final boss becoming friends and having a heartfelt one-on-one battle. Really, the Prophecy feels like a microcosm of the game's story; you meet people, learn about them, befriend them, and use these connections to overcome adversity. Even the main antagonist is a cultist. Even the game's teasers are all about this, heck SoC got an entire video explaining how one of their rituals is to send off precious motorcycles on a grand funeral, because even inanimate objects, if appreciated and loved enough, grow to *hold meaning.*

And, in hindsight, you can also see why a cult is the main antagonistic faction of the game. Religion is a deeply emotional, spiritual experience, oftentimes leading to people being so overcome with emotion and fervor that they lose their sense of self. If you're aware that the Hollows respond to human feelings and seem to detect souls, worshipping them outright and cultivating your emotions through rigid belief systems and rituals is the next step of achieving harmony with Ether.

So yeah, game's peak. ~~It's too bad I don't think the fandom deserves this level of writing.~~

Evelyn and Astra were great too. The story, symbolism aside, was fundamentally about them and their connection. It's not the most original story ever, but it's not the first, and the dynamic of someone from a dark world who wants to protect this pure, idealistic, incorruptible presence in their life will always appeal to me.

The widow subplot is, all things considered, probably somewhat unnecessary? I do like how the implication the InterKnot Post you can find after the story is that her threatening to divorce Joran was the final straw on the camel's back, and her plan is inherently suicidal because she might have seen herself as one of the people responsible for his death.

And Wise and Belle are characterized at their absolute best here, too. It's really nice to see them develop intense personal investment in something that doesn't have anything to do with their own little subplot, and you know, squabble and compete like siblings often do. And Fairy really helped with their dynamic. These characters are so awesome and I love them so much.

1i88roo,https://www.reddit.com/r/JackReacher/comments/1i88roo/i_asked_chatgpt_to_write_a_scene_of_jack_reacher/,I asked ChatGPT to write a scene of Jack Reacher defending his motel room with a can of beans,">Reacher stood in the middle of his motel room, surveying every angle like it was a battlefield. The place was dismal on the best of days — dingy carpet, peeling wallpaper, a bed that squeaked if you looked at it the wrong way. But right now, he liked it. Low ceilings, narrow space, only two exits: the door and the cramped bathroom window. Less ground for him to cover, more chance to control what happened inside. He could tell by the way the goose bumps rose on his arms that trouble was rolling in. He had nothing with him besides a toothbrush, an aging cell phone, and a can of beans he’d picked up at a convenience store earlier. That was it. No guns, not even a Swiss Army knife. Plan A would usually involve minimal fuss, but with multiple intruders, he’d have to be creative.

>He glanced at the door, mentally mapping the lock, the doorjamb, the half-inch gap beneath. He knew they'd try a direct approach — professionals but not military, which meant they'd rely on force instead of finesse. He also calculated their likely formation. Probably three or four men, with a lead tasked to breach, two in support, and maybe one looking up and down the exterior corridor. They’d bank on outnumbering him, not outthinking him. That was their first mistake. Reacher decided the best plan involved funneling them inside the threshold, breaking up their group so he could handle them one or two at a time. He took a breath and picked up the can of beans — weighty enough to cause damage, small enough to swing fast.

>He moved to the side of the door, out of their line of sight if they peered in through the dingy window. He checked the corners for anything else that could come in handy. A coffee maker on the dresser — too big and unwieldy. The desk lamp — light and easily breakable. The can of beans was the best option, more solid than a fist, and metal that wouldn't shatter on impact. If he struck with the right force at the correct angle, it’d be as good as a hammer. He reminded himself to focus on the vital strike zones: temple, base of the skull, solar plexus. A blow to any of those spots would do enough damage to slow an attacker down, maybe knock them out of the fight altogether.

>Then the first man forced the door. Reacher heard the deadbolt crack, and he inhaled slowly to keep calm. The door burst open and the intruder — a tall thug with a thick neck — staggered in, scanning left then right. Reacher wasted no time. He slammed the can of beans into the man’s temple, a quick arc from above that put his whole shoulder into it. The thug went down as if his legs had vanished. The second intruder was right behind, an expression that changed from smug confidence to confusion at the sight of his buddy sprawled on the carpet. Reacher drove a stiff elbow into that man’s chest, spinning him around and knocking him off-balance. Another strike with the can to the base of his skull, and he crumpled next to his friend.

>By now, the remaining guy — or guys — had to realize something was very wrong. Reacher retreated backward a step, letting them decide how to react. If there was a fourth, he’d hesitate — give Reacher precious seconds to keep the upper hand. Sure enough, a third intruder’s shadow moved outside the doorway. Reacher lodged the door open with his foot, forcing the visitor to enter a narrow gap. Less maneuvering room for them, more advantage for him. The can came up again like a baton, and a precise blow to the third man’s forearm disarmed whatever he was holding: a short baton or pipe. Reacher seized it midair and locked the intruder in a chokehold, using the momentum to slam him to the ground. The man’s head hit the carpet with a muffled thud.

>Reacher waited, heart pounding, but no fourth attacker materialized. He heard retreating footsteps in the corridor — someone deciding the odds weren’t worth it anymore. So he stood still, listening for a long moment. All he caught was the buzz of a neon sign outside. Then he let out a breath, wiped the can clean, and set it on the wobbly nightstand. Three men incapacitated, one probably gone. The fight was over. He glanced around the mess, and the squeaking bed, and the battered veneer on the door. Not an ideal situation, but it was survivable. He picked up the phone and dialed the front desk, voice calm, requesting medical assistance and perhaps a broom. When the manager asked what happened, Reacher said only, “Had a little disagreement over a can of beans.”",4,1737653341.0,JackReacher,8,0.64,False

There was one regular who always visited during my shift. He always came in at 1:15pm, sat at the same table, ordered the same meal, and ate quietly while drawing in his notebook. He was always polite and tipped well, so I didn’t mind. 

One day I asked another server about him. 

“Oh, that’s Danny! I think he’s a little slow. He never talks - he only ever communicates in pictures. But he’s a real sweetheart.”

He *was* a sweetheart, just shy. I brought his food every day and smiled at him. One day he drew a picture on the bottom of his receipt - a small bird. I liked it and told him so. From then on, every day he’d draw me a picture in his sketchbook. Birds, cats, flowers. They always made me smile. 

One day he drew a picture of bird wings with the number 119 written beneath them. I asked what it meant, but he just pointed at the wings and the number. So I did some research. Apparently 119 is an “angel number” - it represents new beginnings, positive energy, and prosperity. I thought it was sweet that he’d draw that for me, so I hung it up behind the counter. I guess he liked that, because afterward all his pictures were the same as that one. 

One day a young man entered the shop. As I walked toward him to ask what he wanted, I saw an expression on Danny’s face I’d never seen before - complete, utter terror. As I passed by Danny, the new customer pulled a gun from his jacket and aimed it at me. 

Everything next happened in slow motion. He pulled the trigger. Danny jumped from his seat and dove in front of me. There was a loud *bang*. Danny fell to the floor. I screamed. The shooter raised the gun to his own head and fired. 

The police eventually came, but too late. Danny died holding my hand and smiling at me. 

Weeks later, his mother visited me at the shop. 

“I just wanted to thank you. Danny didn’t have many friends, but he really liked you. Thanks for being kind to him.”

“It was my pleasure,” I replied. “He was a really sweet person. And a good artist - his pictures always brightened my day.”

“Really?” she replied. “Can I see one?”

I showed her the ones behind the counter. “Apparently he was very big on his angel number - he drew it for me all the time.”

At that moment, I realized that the wings in the picture looked just like those on the jacket of the man who’d shot Danny. 

Then I looked over - his mother was gaping at the picture in shock. 

“What?” I asked, concerned. 

She turned and looked at me.

She came into just a little bit of money recently which is also running out. 
She is just such a negative presence 95 percent of the time and it’s exhausting being around her. And still treats me like a child, bossing us around and making the rules even though we pay the bills. She’s mean but somehow always acts like a victim. She’s always playing her music loudly, getting wasted and annoying everyone. It’s to the point where I can barely stand the sight of her but don’t know what to do.

The main thing is I work for a company that practically all my work is under NDA so I cannot work in a coffee shop or in a common area in my apparment. Instead I will either need to live alone, have a large enough room for my desk (which needs a large amount of space as a designer who need multiple screens) or a office all of which will greatly impact the price of where I end up renting in an already expensive area. 

I make a decent amount of money but I'm a contract worker (through another company) and have student loans so I need to keep my costs down as much as I can. 

I'm wondering how I can save money since this is a work expense and I cannot go into the office (fully remote position in a different part of the country) I know I can probably get a tax deduction but I'm not sure / have been convinced that it would not be significant enough to offset the expense I would incur. 


Edit: I know NYC is an expensive city (im not planning to living in Manhattan) but it is the only place that meets my needs so it's not something that can change. I am a designer in a pretty specific feild and while I currently feel like my job is secure (with talk of my being brought on ""contract to hire"") but if anything changes, NY is my best bet for finding a new job.

I've known her for about 8 months (we both play in a community orchestra), she smiles at me a lot and is fairly open to talking to me, and I find her very attractive, so I finally decided to take my shot last week and see where it goes. We went on a coffee date Monday that lasted an hour with us talking and smiling at each other the whole time. There was no kiss or anything, but I did give her a hug both when we got there and left, and I briefly put my arm around her when she said she was cold, and she didn't seem to react negatively to it.

Her texts tend to be very dry, and it's mostly just revolving around planning the date or just answering my question with the most basic replies (I'm always the one to initiate). I'm also not much into texting, but it's a stark contrast compared to my ex-girlfriend who would constantly send heart emojis and ask about me even in the early stages of dating.

I waited one day later and decided to ask her out again for this coming Sunday, though she said she may have things to do that day and would have to see (we had originally planned the first one for this coming Sunday, since she was free that day, but chose this past Monday instead since we were both off of work). I told her to let me know, but she still hasn't replied after 2 days. I know some people use that as an excuse, but I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt. Would it be a good idea to ask her again for a response? Is 6 days too soon between dates? I don't want to pressure her into going out with me if she's not feeling like it.

I apologize if I'm trying to read into things too much, but dating is one thing I don't have a lot of experience with, and I'm also on the autism spectrum, which makes it quite hard to read social cues from people. So far, I've been taking things a bit slow and trying to get to know her on a friendly level with very little flirting.

Product design is at the heart of [our catalog!](https://www.branchfurniture.com/?utm_campaign=optimism&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic) We put a ton of focus on stability - our desks use a dual motor system and a really solid frame that prevents the wobble you might see in cheaper options. This matters a lot when you're trying to work with two monitors and a coffee cup at standing height!

On the affordability front, we sell direct to keep costs down. That means you're getting contract-grade quality (like a 10-year warranty on the Duo) at about half the price of comparable premium desks. We did this by cutting out the middlemen and keeping our lineup simple but versatile.

Some key features worth knowing about:

* Height memory presets so you can easily switch positions
* Anti-collision detection to protect your stuff
* Cable management built in
* Really smooth, quiet motors
* Simple assembly that won't make you question your life choices

For anyone curious about specs or having questions about which model might work best for your space, I'm happy to help! We believe in being transparent about our products.

I wanted to make magnesium carbonate at home with sodium carbonate and magnesium sulfate.

I thought you just get NaSO4 and MgCO3 when mixing them aq, however, this is only the case with *bicarbonate*. I realized this while decomposing the bicarbonate into carbonate and stopped the process. I do not know if i fully converted it, i think so though.

This is what actually happened according to wikipedia..
MgSO4(aq) + Na2CO3(aq) + H2O(l) → Mg4(CO3)3(OH)2·3H2O(s) + Mg(HCO3)2(aq) + NaSO4(aq)

Mg(HCO3)2 and NaSO4 were removed after the experiment.

What i assume is magnesium carbonate hydroxide (verified not to be soluble in water) is sitting in a coffee filter dripping off right now.

Is there a way to verify this really is carbonate hydroxide?

Is there a way to split the MgCO3 and MgOH?

TIA!

However, to actually get him to talk or respond to us, we have to go through his girlfriend. She is his live in partner and is more responsive.

The day before, he was away and I needed to talk to him about something important. She was there with me as we had met for coffee and shopping. I asked her if she would try calling him. She said he will call me back and not to worry. But when he didn't half an hour later, she called him. He answered right away. He said he was driving and and asked her if it was something urgent. She hung up quickly after saying nothing urgent and to call back when he's not driving, which he did, and she handed me the phone.

I've been in recovery for my s\*x addiction for over a year now (and have over a year of sobriety!) and throughout that recovery process, I had been constantly re-working on my boundaries with alcohol, and for the most part that was ""successful"" in terms of me following them.

But last weekend, I had a couple beers at our brewery prior to going to friends for supper, to which the hankering to keep drinking was just there until I fell asleep. And then we had a Christmas party with some of our local friends, to which it was Friday which means I get to have whiskey, which means I drank heavily that night. Then Saturday, I had some leftover coffee in the late afternoon, so naturally I made it Irish, then had a beer, and then when I mentioned about having ""just one whiskey"" my wife kindly discouraged me from doing so. And unbeknownst to me, that started a process that I'm hopeful will change my life...

Once again, I just had that deep nagging/craving to drink because my mind had already been set on it. But when I got told no, I couldn't just turn that craving off. (I have pretty bad ADHD so I knew that this is something I can struggle with). So as I'm just about to turn the lights out to go to bed, I google how people with ADHD manage their cravings for alcohol, I came across a post in an adhd related sub with someone going through almost exactly what I have been, which then led me to this sub, which has been incredibly encouraging for me to finally take the plunge. (My wife has also been great in talking about it all with me and giving me very insightful questions to chew on).

Originally, I was going to try and finish my stash (I love bourbon and have some really nice ones) but that just led to me binging, to which I'd be drunk reading stories on this sub...lol so yesterday, I officially decided that I could have my ""lasts"", and start my journey with sobriety today.

Of course it can feel overwhelming to think about a future with no alcohol, and I'm grateful to be doing this on my own terms before rock bottom inevitably hit. I don't know if I'll do complete sobriety my whole life, and relapses honestly terrify me. BUT I will start with today and only worry about that.

They don’t want to be the guy that asks, “can you see if she has friends?” They want to be the guy that got the original girl in the wild.

The top 10% guys get to date like the top 50% of women. Being chosen by people for dates they don’t know. Having this ability will exponentially increase your dating prospects if you can easily date strangers. Men often discuss this paradox of how the top 50% of women can date randomly so easy, guys have a jealousy about it and call it a privilege. I say you don’t want what those women have it comes at a cost, you want to be the guy who can do what those women can. 

Guys have likely already put out feelers with women in their proximity or social circles for interest. Now they want to be able to cold approach at bars and events or a coffee shop. They want to be the guy that opens a dating app and orders company and affection from women like Uber Eats. Those are the guys that get to all but hand pick the type of woman he wants for a relationship.

When red pill says the word “dating” it’s not about 2 coworkers falling in love, it’s about getting random dates. The women in this casual world often choose the men they fully realize also have unlimited options for dates like she does. That’s what turns her on, not only does she want him, many of her peers would too. He possesses a desirable quality that allows him to easily date many women.

When you’re on a date with a woman you largely do not know, she has some attraction to you built in. The date is more often going to be easy going, fun, and will usually result in a hookup. Guys want this instant validation, they don’t want to wait a year for a girl in his social circle to decide she likes and is attracted to him.

If most average guys could date at around at will, they would show you their harem of average women they’ve been dating past couple months, I have rarely if ever seen that from an average man. For an above average man, that’s fairly common. Women don’t want to casually date average men.

Average guys get girlfriends, but they don’t often get to date around at will with women he has attraction for. It can happen, but he’s getting lucky sometimes, it won’t come easy like the top guys.",5,1737652258.0,PurplePillDebate,23,1.0,False

We've booked places and I'm hoping for some feedback about the amount of activities we're doing, and whether we should try to do more, or scale back (or if we're missing anything super cool in either place/on the way). We're both fairly active (can whip out a 6-8 mile hike as desired) and like walking around the placed we're visiting, eating tasty food, and finding awe in nature. We're interested in seeing wildlife. We usually bring card games/cribbage and like to sit at restaurants/bars/coffee shops and play/hang out. We're planning a busier first part of the trip, and a more relaxed second part of the trip - we don't like to be booked solid, but like to have activities and some structure to the days. Here's what we've got:

  
Day 1 (Arrive Liberia)

* Fly into Liberia, stay at Hilton Garden Inn
* Any suggestions for things we should check out near the airport this evening? We won't have a car, but are good walking or taking public transport

Day 2 (Liberia to La Fortuna)

* Get our rental car at 9am, head to La Fortuna
* Considering a stop at Rincon de la Vieja or Rio Celeste on the way (or could do this on the way to Potrero later)
* Any stops on the way we shouldn't miss?
* Get to La Fortuna in mid/late afternoon - explore town a little, get our bearings, walk around in the woods at our AirBnb

Day 3 (La Fortuna)

* Arenal Volcano hike (El Silencio, 1968 Lava Trail?) OR Fortuna Waterfall hike OR Mistico Hanging Bridges
* Coffee & Chocolate tour at 2pm

Day 4 (La Fortuna)

* Canyoning adventure starting at 7am
* No plans yet for afternoon/evening (more hot springs? couples massage somewhere?)

Day 5 (La Fortuna)

* Arenal Volcano hike (El Silencio, 1968 Lava Trail?) OR Fortuna Waterfall hike OR Mistico Hanging Bridges
* Baldi Hot Springs

Day 6 (La Fortuna to Potrero)

* Considering a stop at Rincon de la Vieja or Rio Celeste on the way

Day 7 (Potrero)

* Beach days at Playa Conchal, Playa Penca, Tamarindo, or Playa Flamingo (alone or in combination)
* Considering a Boat & Rum tour - any recommendations?

Day 8 (Potrero)

* Beach days at Playa Conchal, Playa Penca, Tamarindo, or Playa Flamingo (alone or in combination)
* Dinner at Road Less Traveled

Day 9 (Potrero to Liberia, fly home)

* Flight at 9am, planning to leave Potrero early and go straight to the airport.

I brought 5kg of beans and grounds to Germany (transiting in Dubai). When reaching customs, I was ready to declare it, but I noticed that the customs gate didn't have any personnel. I arrived at night and it was closed. Went through without any problems, but I'd declare it anyways if the customs people were there. 

Thanks to the people who replied to my very obscure question, and hope this helps fellow Kaffee lovers :). Feel free to ask as well if you need any clarifications or if I did anything wrong when reaching customs.

but for that drawing, I don't just want those three similarities, I want as many as possible!!

so far I've got that they both:

* are named Tim (obviously lol)
* are canonically bisexual
* have a brother who was killed by a clown (this one is actually so crazy that they both share lol)
* are hyper competent at their jobs
* are constantly exhausted
* are addicted to coffee (this one and the one above would be a headcanon for Stoker, I think, so lmk if you think they're accurate enough for me to add!)

I'm back at it again, and as I wait for what I hope to be my last round of beta notes, I find myself filling the time with tweaking the query. Late 2023/early 2024 ended in me falling flat on my face with my last, far weaker manuscript (which is great—I've learned so much, and I truly don't regret a thing), so let's see if we can't have better luck in 2025 as a better writer and maybe even a better query letter-er. :) 

Disclaimer: I know Six of Crows is too old to be a comp, but I see it continuosly mentioned on MSWLs, and it seems to be the YA fantasy ""this is a heist book"" flag. Because of this, I've snuck it in alongside two more appropriate ones.

  
Here goes nothing:

  
Dear \[Agent\], 

I hope this letter finds you well. CITY OF DREAMS is a standalone YA fantasy novel with series potential, complete at 94,000 words. Perfect for fans of Leigh Bardugo’s *Six of Crows,* it blends the delectable underworld from Hafsah Faizal’s *A Tempest of Tea* with the masterful deception in Lauren Robert’s *Powerless.* 

18-year-old Kali might wield lies and shed her identity like the skin of a snake, but this time, it’s her best friend who pays the price and gets added to the growing list of apprehended Salkesh dreamers. In everchanging Salkesh, not only dreams but nightmares weave the world—and, with public safety to consider, nightmares are a death sentence, even if sparked by someone else’s mistake. 

Known within Salkesh’s seedy underbelly by more names than she—or anyone else—can count, Kali’s weathered seven long years on the streets with only her best friend as refuge. With meals stretching fewer and further between, her desperation for a warm place to call home has long grown heavy, and her web of lies has finally spun out of control. 

Salvation comes in the form of a secret society of dreamwalking mages, who mistake Kali for one of their own—the perfect jewel to complete their ensemble. Undeterred, she sheds her skin once more and masquerades as the mage they seek, narrowly dodging suspicion but finding herself ensnared by a growing love for her newfound family, her far too alluring mentor, and the secrets that linger in the society’s halls. The Dreamwalkers have a plan to recover the ledger of apprehended dreamers, but their upcoming heist hinges entirely on Kali’s so-called magic. Her secrets are splitting her in two—and if she’s caught, she’ll not only lose the family she never thought she’d have, but watch any chance of saving her best friend slip right through her deft hands. 

By day, I am a psychology student at \[Mexican university\] and a \[redacted\] where my time involves medical writing and editing articles. Nestled in the mountains in \[redacted\], I can be found with a cat on my lap and coffee in hand. Like Kali, I am both autistic and Latinx (Salvadoran-Canadian), and I am a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community. Thank you for your time and consideration.

This morning I was in the metro station when the turnstile thing declined. I knew I had passes so I knew it was a problem with their machine and not my pass.

I need to get this checked.

Anyways when it was my turn in line I said hi and told him my pass wasn’t working. I had watched what the people in front of me who had the same issue did, they scanned their pass on the reader at the service attendant desk then the turnstile worked. So I tried it but it didn’t work for me, and I couldn’t hear the guy speaking behind the plexiglass, like AT ALL, so I just kept nervously scanning my card over and over and trying to get through. I know, it was dumb on my part I guess. I wasn’t listening to him because I couldn’t hear him, and I had no breakfast in me just a coffee.

I wanted to cry. Anyways, he took this opportunity to yell at me, in the most aggressive hateful voice, “HOLD THE CARD OVER THE READER IF YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU”.

I finally heard him when he said that. I have a dad who screams at me all the time so I kind of just shut down and replied “Jesus fuck man okay…” and held the card and it scanned. The turnstile then worked.

I’m just…shaken. Somehow I feel like it’s my fault? I don’t know, I feel so stupid and small. I need to get my hearing checked but I still don’t think he should’ve yelled at me.

This is our annual event where we showcase pieces from some of our favorite writers on the subreddit, discussing some of their favorite records of the year! We'll be running through the bulk of January with one new writeup a day from a different [r/indieheads](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads) user! Today, u/MoisesNoises has come to share an essay on Katy Kirby's *Blue Raspberry*

[Anti- - January 26, 2024](https://preview.redd.it/a6osmjdxtree1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ff74bf5cf3d62cdaa0b4730820768d4a4c5e220)

**Background:**

Katy Kirby is a multi-instrumentalist singer/songwriter based in Nashville, TN. She grew up in Spicewood, TX and listened primarily to worship music as a child. Her primary collaborator is Logan Chung, who works on arrangements, production, and performs live with Kirby as well.

The music of *Blue Raspberry* has been performed live since at least 2022, and features contributions from Christian Lee Hutson (“Party of the Century”). Much of the recording was done in studios, as well as their own homes. *Blue Raspberry* was released on January 27, 2024.

**Write-up** by u/moisesnoises

**“I put our reconciliation in my calendar”**

A gentle piano chord sets the key, and the first words you hear sung on *Blue Raspberry* is a bit of cheeky wordplay: “Mutually assured distraction.” Two people, fully committed to the bit of keeping each other off-task. Does “assured destruction” then follow?

The answer: probably. In fact, it’s probably happened already. On the opening track of *Blue Raspberry*, “Redemption Arc”, Katy Kirby charts out a sweet and square eighth-node melody with a steady but slightly plodding pulse, a molasses hup-one-two, which blooms into the chorus’s lilting 6/8, redolent of a drinking song, or cabaret ballad. Fitting that the first time I heard “Redemption Arc” was in a crowded San Francisco club in 2022. The lyrics have stuck with me since then; I feel immediately the alcohol-fugged air, the syrup-sticky hardwood clenching my shoe soles, the KN-95 hugging the flat bridge of my nose and fogging my glasses, as Kirby winks: “You’re doin’ the work now, you’re tryin’ so hard / this one goes out to your redemption arc.” On the record, as she arrives on the word “arc”, the instrumental accompaniment – a squishy crash of distorted guitar, scratchy strings, and lazy drums – stumbles messily, drunkenly, on the home chord, hinting perhaps that this arc is not yet completed.

“Redemption Arc” continues:

>You misspelled apology

>You ended it with I and E

>Diminutive contrition

>But I still know what you mean

“Apologie”? Perhaps the note-leaver meant “apologies”, plural, implying there’s more to apologize for down the line? Maybe the French *apologie*? No further context is given behind this snippet; it could be a note on the fridge, an email, a break-up text. Kirby elides the larger-picture details of these stories, less concerned with telling and focusing on feeling. You *feel* her chuckling softly at the word “apologie” without having to say that she “found it funny”. By leaving out just enough detail to ground us in the scene completely (a trait shared with our best contemporary observational writers, like Lydia Davis and Jenny Offill), Kirby draws us into the feeling of a genuine, lived-in relationship.

And that’s just the first half of Katy Kirby’s incredible sophomore album *Blue Raspberry*! A confessional and queer folk rock record exploring many dimensions of human fallibility, rendered with a colorfully lived-in instrumental palette and Kirby’s singularly crystal clear vocal delivery. In it, Kirby traces the shape of relationships in various stages: the euphoric before, the highs-and-lows of the middle, the closure and acceptance of after. The throughline of her explorations of human relationships is artifice; the things we say or do, the things we hide behind, and accept anyway. These shields can be tacit or explicit, but are a key part of who we are. Whether we perform the role of loving partner, scorned lover, guy-who-chronically-fucks-up, we hold, and often embrace, the artifice that comes with it. In other words, the *Blue Raspberry* of it all.

**i. “Synthetics are preferable, no matter the price” / Things not found in nature**

>“Oh, don’t buy that,” Catherine says at the bodega. “It has Blue No. 1 in it.” I look at her, pretend to read the package. “It’s the only dye that is known to cross the blood-brain barrier. That’s what protects the brain from toxins.”

>–Jenny Offill (*Weather*, p. 81-82)

In the 1970s, the most prevalent syrups for sno-cones and candies were strawberry, cherry, and raspberry; all variants of a shade of red called Red No. 2. When it turned out that Red No. 2 was very much unsafe for human consumption, brands started to turn to other colors to assuage public fears. An amalgam of other flavor essences dyed with a new blue dye, called Blue No. 1.

Thus, the flavor, the concept, the idea, of a blue raspberry was born. In a way, blue raspberry was the savior of the laboratorially-developed color/flavor industry, this artificial thing which in every conceivable way is not found in nature. The eponymous flavor is one form of artifice that Kirby implements as a theme of *Blue Raspberry*.

Kirby explores this idea of “blue raspberry”, as in, things that aren’t found in nature. Lyrically, this manifests in a myriad of ways: “cold plastic water bottles”, “cubic zirconia”, “sugar cubes”, “rock candy”, “glitter”, “styrofoam”, artificial sweeteners that come in “yellow, blue, and pink” packets. These pop up throughout the record, even reprised across songs. It serves as a connecting metaphor for the work as a whole, pointing towards all the stuff we’re more-or-less stuck with as humans in the 21st century.

What is Kirby exploring that “isn’t found in nature”? For one, queerness; Kirby’s very first songs about queer relationships make up much of *Blue Raspberry*’s runtime. For born-and-raised Christians like Kirby and myself, we were fed the opposite. The doctrine of queerness-not-being-found-in-nature fucked me up for years, and being able to embrace that side of me fully in adulthood took, in no uncertain terms, a long-ass time.

It’s cathartic, and thrilling, to see someone come into their full selves, with all the highs and lows, the joys and sorrows, the moments of sheer happiness and complete, utter messes that are involved in that process of becoming. On the record’s most high-flying, blissful moment, “Cubic Zirconia”, Kirby sings a lovely melody, bolstered by a glorious vocal performance and a steadily building band arrangement. It sounds as if she’s singing to someone named Cubic Zirconia, a love song to artifice itself.

The revelation of this track is not just acceptance of this thing “not found in nature”, but embracing it wholeheartedly. Even “cold plastic water bottles / held against the light” carry a comparable shine to diamonds, so why wouldn’t that be enough? Perhaps, even, Why would she ask for more? It’s a beautiful reassurance that, yes, loving someone for who they are is reason enough. No need to elaborate: simply behold.

Sometimes giving up the artifice is the answer too. “Drop Dead” contemplates a series of romantic and personal rituals: buying roses and diamond rings (alongside another cubic zirconia mention), measuring BMI, hyaluronic acids… The chorus contains both the phrases “let me drop dead, gorgeous” and “I will give up on you”. To me, Kirby here is in pursuit of a more authentic self, naming the artificial shit that’s causing her to get down on herself, holding her back from acceptance. It’s also just a lot of fun – I mean, who else would sing the words “hyaluronic acids” like that, or break into triplets over the phrase “unoutlineable Bermuda Triangles”?

To contrast, and thereby accentuate, the lyrical theme of artifice, Kirby’s instrumental approach is earthy and straightforward. The instrumental palette of *Blue Raspberry* feels like a lived-in home, replete with all its warmths and quirks. The guitars are bright and lively, the drums laid back and relaxed, and the pianos … You can vividly envision the room just based on the piano plonks alone, ever so lightly worn and barely out-of-tune (acknowledged explicitly at the very end of “Naperville”, a deluxe edition track, where a bandmate taps an E-flat repeatedly, remarking that it’s “kinda pitchy up here”). An ragged electric piano stumbles trying to find the right keys during the outro of “Table”. On the track “Fences”, a strange, off-kilter rickety noise provides a wobbly percussive touch throughout. My bet is on the piano’s wobbly, aging frame and pedals – you can almost imagine the titular “fences” of the song threatening to fall apart completely.

Several key touches from Logan Chung, Kirby’s longtime collaborator (everything from songwriting to production to live performance), elevate the lived-in feeling of the instrumentation, lending a subtly wondrous quality. In “Redemption Arc”, sliding high-pitched strings evoke shooting stars, a vivid backdrop to its nighttime tipsy ambling. Twinkling guitars in “Party of the Century” lend an ironic sparkle to its apocalyptic musings. And throughout, Chung adds grit to the textures of *Blue Raspberry*, like running your hand on the wooden deck and catching a splinter. The grounded sonic palette makes the lyrical references to things-not-found-in-nature stick out more.

In my research of “blue raspberry” the flavor, I’ve seen that it’s supposed to resemble the flavor of a “nightcap raspberry”, apparently a real-life dark blue raspberry (Google images are underwhelming to say the least). Considering that “blue raspberry” was just an amalgam of whatever its inventors had on hand, I call bullshit on it being a flavor-replication of a raspberry I’m convinced no one has ever seen in real life.

A perfect segue, in other words, to the second way Kirby explores artifice through “blue raspberry”, which is: lies, fibs, fabrications.

**ii. “Names were changed to protect the participants” / Lies, fibs, fabrications**

>“\[Mumble mumble\].”

>“I can’t hear you.”

>“Do you want to hear me?”

>“No.”

>–Lydia Davis, *Our Strangers* (p. 173)

“This is a song about being in an open relationship… It’s hard,” said Katy Kirby to a hushed audience at Chicago’s Empty Bottle, prefacing “Wait Listen”, a title that evokes a sense of wrongdoing, a desire to apologize.

The slow harmonic movement, muted driving toms, and gentle melodies washed over us, dynamics ebbing and tiding. Then, the instrumental backdrop softened, spotlighting this brutal left-hook of a lyric:

>So I turned off my location

>Let her fuck me like you thought you did

>I remember every minute

Katy Kirby’s version of “confessional” songwriting isn’t so much revealing the flaws of someone who did her wrong, nor is she concerned with taking the blame solely. She writes multidimensional, layered portraits of relationships, in their highs and lows, both parties trading and acknowledging blame for when it goes wrong. In “Wait Listen”, not once does the narrator explicitly say that they’re sorry, only that they “didn’t say \[they\] didn’t warn \[them\]” – lying by omission. It’s a tricky in-between that every relationship, romantic/sexual/platonic or otherwise has experienced. Katy Kirby isn’t bullshitting around here with therapy speak, or with hypothetical I’m Sorries or You Did Me Wrongs; she’s telling us how it is, leaving it open for us to consider the outcome of this episode. However, at the very end, Kirby playfully conceals the identities of the people involved:

>Healing over, still embedded

>Names were changed to protect the participants

>Perverse sense of obligation

“Hand to Hand” provides an ominous and strange backdrop to scenes of a relationship-in-decline. The chord progression has at most three chords, and the tempo is slow and deliberate, the “hand to hand” less Anime-fight-scene or James Bond and more morning-in-the-park Tai Chi. The scenes explored in this song are even extra blurry, but you feel the strain of the relationship, the “covenant” shared between two parties so off-the-rails, yet agreed upon because it’s all they seem to know. The final verse seems to portray the aftermath of apparent violence, and hints at its continual nature:

>What I can’t remember can’t hurt me,

>Thank God in advance I’m already forgetting.

A relationship can feel at times an arbitrary agreement. Kirby says here, with the spooky vibes of “Hand to Hand”, that cementing a partnership with someone on solely arbitrary grounds is, by all accounts, a lie, and a sure path to a cycle of destruction.

However, acknowledging dishonesty, whether lying by omission, agreeing to uphold an arbitration, or failing to keep a promise, opens up the door to possible forgiveness. “Alexandria” is *Blue Raspberry*’s most emotionally frayed moment. At the beginning, sustained cello hits are interspersed with long silences, announcing a hesitation. Whereas “Redemption Arc”’s waltzy-lilt has a tongue-in-cheekness about it, “Alexandria” starts small and scared to start, but opens up, the floodgate that accompanies an outpouring of withheld emotion.

Compare the end of verse 1, a tentative, possibly a bit sarcastic, venture into forgiveness:

>Alexandria

>Baby, you’re off the hook

>For every promise you couldn’t keep.

To the final verse, where the heightened instrumental performance bolsters the sense of sad, yet final, acceptance that the other person has fallen in love with someone else:

>Alexandria,

>Cubic Zirconia,

>I hope it’s better than you thought it would be.

There’s that cubic zirconia again.

Anchoring every song is Kirby’s gloriously clear singing voice, sparkling like a diamond (real or fake, it’s all the same), a pleasant timbre bullseyeing a triangulation of Cosmos, Marling, and Spektor. Her vocal control and technique are effortless, gliding birdlike across the record’s most high-flying moments (the chorus of “Cubic Zirconia”) and subtly fraying at its most emotionally straining moments (“Alexandria”). Kirby writes melodies carefully, tunefully, and intentionally, never straining her vocal tessitura.

Kirby’s vocal performance wavers between two modes. At times, it possesses a pseudo-deadpan quality, delivering the record’s most frank truths with a sort of cool, disaffected shrug, heightening their emotional impact. Where other singer-songwriters might rise to a scream, a shout, a yell, Kirby stays gentle and measured, even as instrumental chaos might threaten to tear itself around her.

Sonically, this effect is most deeply felt on the closing track “Table”. As the instrumental accompaniment roars, scuzzed-up and blown-out, Kirby is utterly unshaken. It feels at once powerful, and also like Kirby is holding back a bit – holding back so much in fact, that the lyrics she’s singing nonchalantly become almost unintelligible against the harshness tearing in from all directions. Lyrically, some sort of crisis-of-faith is happening throughout the noise in “Table”, but by playing it cool, it seems like she’s barely holding it together inside.

In other instances, her soft vocal begets a sense of sincere vulnerability. On “Wait Listen”, Kirby voice isn’t calling out to her lover in the rain with huge dramatics – *Wait! Listen!* – but it rises just above a sotto voce, drawing us into the harsh intimacy of this conflict, the kind of fight that arises unbidden in your most intimate moments. Kirby’s hushed vocal carries the pain of something better off withheld, but disclosed nonetheless with a heavy reluctance.

At our most vulnerable moments, we humans often prefer a lie for self preservation. It’s easy to attack such a liar in confessional songwriting, but it’s much, much harder to own up to that inevitable aspect of humanness in a way that doesn’t make you seem like a) the absolute scumbag on the earth, or b) a hopeless self-deprecator. Kirby’s keen eye on her own human condition makes the dishonesty feel like not like a moral shortcoming, but rather a complimentary, necessary element to forgiveness and genuineness.

It’s all a part of figuring out who you are, both to yourself and others. Why wouldn’t that be enough?

# Conclusion: “Why wouldn’t that be enough?”/ Acceptance

On “Salt Crystal,” Kirby is playfully fed up with her lover trying to be perfect all the time: “Spare me your obsession with that incorruptibility.” On this, and the tracks prior, Kirby has outlined several facets of human fallibility and error. The real triumph of *Blue Raspberry* comes when Kirby realizes that these things, these human shortcomings, can be reasons in themselves to love someone.

The whirlwind of acceptance propels the sweetly sung and brightly picked “Party of the Century”. Kirby seems ideologically and logistically at odds with the person that she’s singing to, but they’re a “time-bound entity event,” like her, “the party of the century”. It’s an odd compliment, but absolutely in line with Kirby’s brand of stamping strange poetry on lived-in relationship dynamics. It also captures the cosmic and temporal un-likelihood of two people meeting at all. To call it “the party of the century” probably sells it short, and yet we’re all invited.

Acceptance of artifice is best seen in Kirby’s use of evocative figurative language. Metaphors are in themselves a kind of fabrication, and in Kirby’s hands, simple sentiments and cliches across *Blue Raspberry* are rendered vividly, occasionally goofy and sincere, at others completely transcendent: instead of having a crush, she is “under her heel like rock candy” (Blue Raspberry). Instead of calling someone beautiful, she sees “the prettiest mermaid in the souvenir shop” (Cubic Zirconia). And in the most stunning (and devastating) image of the record, perhaps instead of “I love you”:

>The rhinestones on your baseball cap reminding me of when

>The salt left crystal on the sunset of your sunburned skin

This closing phrase to the chorus of “Salt Crystal”, a lyrical and melodic sister-song to “Cubic Zirconia”, holds unbearable amounts of emotion in a single image, nostalgic and lovely, the lush sequence of sibilants evoking the sparkling sunset of the album cover.

That striking image leads to the thematic apotheosis of the album, the title track. She takes the idea of “blue raspberry” to its very extreme, almost singing to the flavor itself. It’s a song of burgeoning love, sweet (saccharin?) and lovely. It holds the most “artificial” production touch, an eerie vocal filter that layers a vocal several octaves underneath her own. Somehow, it isn’t intrusive or distracting – it’s just present enough to give a hint of that Coke Zero aftertaste.

There’s almost something spiritual, holy about the way she views the person she loves. Kirby sketches out a wonderful scene in a diner: the other person adding one packet each of Splenda, Equal, and Sweet’n’Low to her plain white mug of coffee; under the lights, her beloved fluoresces angelically, this little moment made holy. In the bridge, Kirby confesses her love in a singularly *Blue Raspberry* manner, the very thesis statement of the album:

>I don't care if whatever you are is found in nature

>You hold the patent for that flavor

*Blue Raspberry* invents its own figurative language of love. It seeks salvation in human fallibility, in artifice, the shields that we tacitly acknowledge, yet accept without hesitation. It’s looking at the ingredients label, not knowing what the fuck Red 40 is, then shrugging as you pop that candy into your mouth anyway. And relishing it.

During my learning I've been comparing the grammar of both languages to help me understand some concepts in Icelandic that I don't immediately intuit on first viewing, seeing as they're both North Germanic languages. I'm well aware of people's opinions on this and take care to do it within reason and not force every single grammar concept in Icelandic into a way that fits Swedish grammar. 

Having said that, I was wondering if any Icelandic people here who also speak Swedish/are familiar with Swedish can explain ætla to me. Ýlyra and the (brilliant) Icelandic for foreigners YouTube channel explain that ætla is basically a way of conveying intent to a sentence talking about a future action. I've also heard it explained as a way of being polite, similar to ""I wonder if I can get a coffee"" in English. Additionally, it's apparently used in a similar manner to the first example, but in a sentence talking about the past, where the usage of ætla indicates that you *didn't* perform the action.

As a Swede, this usage sounds and feels very similar to the way we use the words **ska** and **skulle**, plus *kom* and *kommer*, as a way of communicating intent, and especially politeness in the case of **skulle** and *kommer* when in the right contexts. Would I be able to use ætla and its conjugations in the same way as the words above, or is there something I still haven't understood about the word that prevents that usage?

1i87ngq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1i87ngq/my_personal_experience_beginning_insurance_issues/,"My personal experience, beginning (+ insurance issues) to end (with recovery so far!)","I’m an anxious person naturally, so I try to do as much research as possible before anything. I got loads of help from this subreddit, so I wanted to take the time to go through my situation from start to finish to hopefully help anyone else who is like me! I’ll try to keep it as organized as possible. I am an over-communicator, so I apologize for the length of this, feel free to skip to relevant parts for you. Or not read at all, of course!

Tl;Dr: Everything went as planned for the procedure and recovery so far, but I had to fight with insurance a little to ensure it was covered at 100% like it was supposed to be. Gave details of what I did to prepare for surgery as well. 

# Pre-appointment/background info

To start, I have no kids, but have a husband of 16 years (well, all together 16 years, we dated for 8 years before we got married), and he had a vasectomy 7 years ago or so. I’m 34 and we live in Texas. We’ve never wanted kids and get our “kid fix” when we see our nephews and niece. My husband and I are also a part of the ENM/CNM community (Ethical/consensual non-monogamy), which is the reason I got an IUD placed about a year ago (as an extra precaution because condoms are always used). Well, since the IUD I had a number of issues (as I have in the past with any hormonal birth control) - the OBGYN I went to told me that I wouldn’t have any side effects because it didn’t mess with hormones in the same way. Well…I had a slew of issues that I won’t get into unless people want to know and I decided in November, after the election specifically, that I would go ahead and get a bisalp done. To note: I’ve never had surgery before (minus wisdom teeth removal).

I went to a new OBGYN because I didn’t think mine would be open to the idea, based on past conversations and her attitude of “it’ll get better” when it came to my symptoms. So, I found one through a friend group that seemed promising. I called at the end of November and got an appointment for mid-December. (I will make sure to put her on the List because last I checked she wasn’t on there.)

# Initial appointment

I met with my new doctor and told her all of my symptoms and she gave me my options, one of which was a bilateral salpingectomy. I told her “I want that” and she didn’t bat an eye. She said “okay” and ran down what that would look like and what risks came with it. She asked if I wanted her to remove the IUD right then or wait until the procedure and I decided to wait until the procedure. She agreed and said she would get everything set up. My procedure would be Jan 22nd and I would have my pre-op the week prior. 

# Leading up to the pre-op/ Insurance Issues

I got a call from the doctor’s office informing me that they spoke with my insurance and since it was the beginning of the year, I owed my deductible and would have to pay around $900. I have one of the worst insurances imaginable (United) and worried that what they were saying was true, even though I was under the impression I wouldn’t owe anything out of pocket. Enter Reddit (again) - I received help from some very knowledgeable people. I read through the Preventative Coverage sheet from my UHC portal to confirm a bisalp was covered (which was difficult because it showed clearly a tubal was covered, but I had to search for the code Reddit gave me to find the bisalp, which was labeled under ‘Sterilization - Laparoscopy with Removal of Adnexal Structures’. I called my doctor’s office back and confirmed which codes they were using (58661 & Z30.2; the correct ones) and the billing person told me what my insurance told her. So, I thanked her and called my insurance.

When I spoke to the insurance rep, I was told “yes, it will be covered at 100% without needing to meet deductible because it was preventative.” I asked if I could receive any sort of documentation because when my doctor’s office called, they were told something different. She said she could not provide me with anything but referred me back to the preventative care sheet I already had. 

So, I called my doctor’s office back and asked if they could call again. They said they would. I receive a call back around 1 from the billing person and she said she called and had been on with them for a while. She explained that the woman she spoke to didn’t seem to know what she was talking about because she was saying it was preventative but that I would still owe my deductible, and when my billing person said the patient was told something different, she said “hang on” and put her on hold for a while (this apparently had happened multiple times in their conversation) and would come back with different information. Billing person said: “Could I speak to your supervisor because it seems like you might not have all the information?” And she said “okay” and put her on hold for a long time and then the call dropped. 

My billing person asked me to call them back and then patch her in. So, I called around 1:27pm (my doctor's office didn’t open back up from lunch until 1:30) and got on the phone with a man I'll name Carl (just for clarity of the rest of this) - Carl was my new favorite person by the end of this. Carl confirmed for me that the procedure should be covered at 100% with nothing out of pocket on my end. I asked if I could patch in my doctor’s office and he said “of course” - I called my doctor’s office and got the billing person patched in. She went on her spiel about what she had been told so far and her experience with speaking with others at UHC. He confirmed for her that it would be covered at 100% and apologized on behalf of the other people she had spoken to and said he would look into those calls. He gave her the reference code and we all went on our merry way. We got off the phone at around 1:41. Fastest phone call dealing with insurance I think I’ve ever had. I was so incredibly relieved that I had gotten it worked out, but also so upset that I had to go through that process at all. How many people pay that aren’t supposed to have to pay simply because they don’t know?

# Pre-op

This was super simple and quick. She confirmed that I still wanted the procedure and we discussed again what the procedure would look like. I let her know that I get nauseous super easily, so she made sure to prescribe me some Zofran and told me to let them know during prep for the surgery as well so that they could give me all the necessary things. She sent in all my prescriptions (Ibuprofen 600mg, Hydrocodone .5mg, Zofran) so that I would be able to get them before the procedure, which I appreciated. 

Went to check out/confirm my follow-up appointment and was told I owed $900. I explained my conversation that had happened earlier in the week with the billing department, and they said “Oh, okay. Well, I’ll let her know then.” And that was that.

Also called the billing department at the hospital to confirm everything, and she told me “No, it’s preventative, you won’t owe anything.” So, at least they were aware!

# Day before the procedure

My house was relatively clean still from us having cleaned it over the weekend, so I didn’t have to worry about that too much. I made sure to put all of my meds on my bedside table, I plugged in my heating pad and set it on the bed, I brought my Steam Deck (gaming console) upstairs and plugged the dock into the TV in my room, moved the controller up there, too. I made sure I laid out the clothes I was going to wear to the hospital (a loose shirt, loose PJ-like pants I found on Amazon, maternity underwear for the comfort factor, socks, my sweatshirt that says ‘Do the things they burned our ancestors for’ because I felt it was fitting, and made sure my slip ons were downstairs by the door). I packed a small bag with pads (because of course I started my period), an extra shirt and underwear, my phone charger, and my Kindle just in case. They wanted me to take a shower the night before using the antibacterial soap that came in my pre-op kit from the hospital, so I did that, too. Then, I stayed up until almost 11, had a snack around 10:30 of cheese, goldfish, and Pringles before I went to bed (so healthy, I know).

# Procedure Day (yesterday)

I was told to not have solid food after 11 pm the night before, but that I could have black coffee, water, and a pre-surgery drink they provided in my pre-op kit from the hospital (which was wild to me, tbh. It’s made by Ensure, it’s a clear drink with 50g of carbs to help with recovery after anesthesia) - as long as it was an hour before I left my house. So, I drank all of those things the morning of surgery around 8:30am. I was really happy because I was worried I’d have a caffeine headache and be starving by the time my surgery started at 12:30pm. Thanks, science! I also took a shower with the antibacterial soap they gave me (again, as part of the pre-op kit) - they told me to do this the night before and the morning of.

Anyway, we left the house around 10am to get there before 10:30. Got checked in, it was quick and easy. Got my beautiful gown and socks. Peed for the pregnancy test (got complimented for my hydration lol). They did vitals and they gave me a cocktail of pills: gabapentin (for nerve pain), Tylenol (for pain), Celebrex (for pain), and Pepcid (to help with nausea from anesthesia). My veins are rude, so the first nurse ended up busting the one in my left hand (after trying really hard to make sure she didn’t). The other nurse came in and worked just as hard and was able to get the blood she needed and then the IV hooked up in my right hand. Both were a bit painful, if I’m honest. But, it’s also my norm when it comes to my veins. While the second was searching, she asked if I drink water, and I said “all the time” and the other nurse confirmed that my urine was lighter than apple juice (haha). They had me sign all of my consents, minus the anesthesia consents, which would be done with the anesthesiologist. 

My nurse did ask: “how many kids do you have?” but wasn’t weird about it when I said “none” - she instead asked about pets. 

Anyway, after that, they made sure I was settled and left. My husband and I hung out for about 45 minutes or so before the anesthesiologist came in. He explained everything in detail, but one weird thing was:

“Do you drink?”  
“Maybe once a month at most”  
“Do you have kids?”  
“Nope”  
“Hmm…\[pause\] do you have pets?”  
“Yes”  
“Are they well-behaved?”  
“They are.”  
“Well, between that and no kids, it’s no wonder you don’t need to drink.”

I don’t know if it was him playing off his “hmm” about kids or not, but other than that he was personable and kind. I loved his assistant, though. (I’ll get to her in a minute)

Anyway, he was thorough in his explanations and told me my risks, of course, but also said that I had more risk getting in the car and driving home than I did under anesthesia, which of course makes sense. I wasn’t worried about it, though. He left and told me his assistant would be in soon and she was. About 2-3 minutes later.

She was hilarious and so helpful. She explained that she would make sure to work on all the receptors that make us nauseous to make sure I woke up without issue. She also gave me something ‘to take the edge off’ and boy did it work. She left, my doctor came in to check on me and go over everything again and made sure consents were signed. I reminded her about my IUD as well, since it wasn’t in the consents, so she made sure to add it and had me sign for that.

After that, the nurse helping the doctor and the anesthesiologist assistant (I’m sorry, I can’t remember her actual title and don’t want to use names) came back in. She gave me the feel-good drug and then they wheeled me back after a goodbye kiss from the hubs. This was about 12:30.

I was in the OR, they helped me transfer to the table, and I remember chatting a little bit and that was it. I don’t even remember the mask being placed. Then, suddenly, I was waking up in the recovery room. 

# Recovery 

Another nurse was there to greet me and told me everything was done and I was in recovery. I asked if everything went okay and she said “yep, it went great!” And she asked how I was feeling, I told her I felt okay but my throat kind of hurt. She asked if I wanted ice chips and I said yes please. Those babies were amazing, I’ve never enjoyed eating ice more. She asked about my pain level and I told her it was about a 6. She gave me some Dilaudid and asked how I was a few minutes later (adding ‘be honest!’ Which I appreciated, honestly) and I was down to about a 2. She told me to let her know if that changed, she could give me more. But, it didn’t. She asked me what I wanted back in my room and offered options, I decided on graham crackers, applesauce, and ginger ale. My pain went down to a 1 about the time they transferred me back to my room. I felt like I was in a great mood, my husband said I was, too. They said I did really well in recovery waking up (I don’t know if it was that pre-surgery drink or not, but I don’t think it hurt). 

Back in my room, I chatted with my husband and ate my ice chips until they brought me my snacks. My nurse came in and checked on me. They reminded me that I needed to pee before I could leave, so they brought me a bottle of water to go along with my ginger ale, graham crackers, and applesauce. I consumed everything relatively quickly. When I looked at the time, it was about 2:30 or 2:45, I can’t remember exactly. It took a bit for the urge to pee to crop up, but it finally did and I went into the bathroom. It took a minute and required me to “push” a little for anything to come out, but I was able to pee a little and that was all they needed. I was told I could put my clothes on and she would get the discharge paperwork.

I got a bit nauseous while I was putting my clothes back on and laid back down. She came in with discharge paperwork and went over everything with my husband. My good mood started to go at this point and she had me take it slow to avoid more nausea. My husband left to get the car pulled around and she got me in the wheelchair and wheeled me out. I kept my eyes closed pretty much the whole car ride home because of the nausea (although, it wasn’t as bad as I expected).

# Home recovery (so far)

Back home, I went upstairs to bed and took my hydrocodone, stool softener, GasX, and Zofran and laid down. My husband brought up some chicken and rice soup and crackers. My mouth was dryer than anything I’ve ever experienced. It was like the Sahara desert. I’ve never had such a hard time eating crackers in my life. But, I ate most of the soup, drank lots of water, my husband laid next to me with his lunch and we watched Bob’s Burgers. I dozed off a bit after that while my husband made some work calls. 

From there, the rest of the evening was uneventful. I definitely had the gas pain everyone talked about, but I was prepared for this (and I have a history of having gas pain in general. It started when I was young and has been an ongoing issue in my life). While it was more persistent than the gas pain I’ve experienced before, it wasn’t necessarily worse. After I would lay down for a bit, I would get up and immediately have to burp, but then the pain in my shoulder/chest/rib cage would return because it would go away while I was laying down. I didn’t feel pain from my incision area at all, but I attribute that to the pain meds and staying ahead of the pain. My husband kept offering to do things for me, but I was able to do most everything for myself (I let him cater to me some, though). We had Jason’s Deli for dinner because they told me to have blander food and it was the only thing that sounded okay. So, I got a chicken salad sandwich, some fruit, Ruffles, and a cookie. I ate everything but half of the cookie. 

I made myself stay up until 11 to be able to take my pain meds again before going to bed. I took the hydrocodone and Zofran again (narcotics make me nauseous) and took another stool softener and got myself set up for bed. I slept from about 11pm to 5am, minus getting up to pee a few times. I woke up at 5am to my cat curled up next to me. I was honestly super impressed by both of my cats, I think they knew I wasn’t myself because they were extra careful with me yesterday, even my 1 year old who is normally in zoomies-mode for half the day. She had pressed her paws a little into my stomach, which naturally kind of hurt, but I was just happy she wasn’t trying to lay on top of me like she normally does. I woke up, fed them their breakfast, and got myself an ice pack, took the Ibuprofen 600mg, and laid back down. I couldn’t go back to sleep, though, so I laid there for about 30 minutes before getting up. 

I made myself a smoothie with lots of fiber and drank my coffee, sitting on the couch with my heating pad again. It’s now 10am as I finish writing this and I’m feeling alright. Still have some gas pain, but not like yesterday, and my stomach just feels kind of sore when I move around. My stomach is definitely a bit distended and I haven’t had a bowel movement yet, but I kind of didn’t expect to. I’ll keep at it with the stool softeners and fiber. The incisions look about as I expected, kind of scabbed and bruised, but otherwise look fine. I’ll take a shower sometime this afternoon, the doctor said to let the soap and water run over me but not to scrub, naturally. 

My pain when I’m sitting: 1/10 with some discomfort from the gas. When I’m moving around, maybe a 3 or 4 out of 10. All in all I think it’s what I expected and planned for. I don’t go back to work until Monday (it’s Thursday, currently) and I think that was a safe move on my part. As long as I continue to heal correctly, I should be good to go!

The only thing that still seems to be slightly annoying is my peeing. It’s hard for me to have a normal stream. This doesn’t surprise me, as my urethra is tiny and any sort of swelling in that area is likely going to restrict some of that flow, but it’s also something I didn’t anticipate. So, if you are like me and have had weird peeing issues in the past, just be prepared to have to sit for a bit to try to empty your bladder. It’s not worrisome, just a bit annoying. 

Anyway, I think that about sums it up! If I continue to heal as normal, I won’t update this. If something changes, I will. Otherwise, feel free to ask me any questions and I’m happy to answer!",6,1737650610.0,sterilization,4,1.0,False

I have printer plugged in to the same outlet however, printer and coffee maker are never in use at the same time.

I'm pasting what I posted on the other thread below, and I'd like to hear your opinions. Mods, I hope this thread is okay.

>I have a lot to say about this and little time, so let me ramble incoherently:

>1: In many ways, Hollywood is stuck in the dark ages. To be a TV writer, you *have* to live in LA. There's some (not much) leeway for screenwriters doing features, but for TV you legit have to live in LA in the vast majority of cases. This means the industry, for all its talk of diversity, only really accepts writers from one single nationality who live in one specific country in one specific city. This is why, to me, The Witcher felt like a high-budget LARP session. There is zero sense of culture, because there is no connection to the story's culture.

>2: More subjective: there's still a huge feeling of nerd shame. You can see this in the MCU. The dialogue never gets to breathe for long because the movies both treat you like you have super ADHD, and don't really believe that some dude in a cape talking about magic stones can really be taken seriously. You can see the opposite of this in anime (and I'm the farthest thing from a weeb): a premise can be 100% ridiculous, but the stories are always earnest. There is space for ridiculousness even in non-comedy stories, but there's no sense of shame, not a wink of: ""This is stupid, right? Haha, let me acknowledge it, I swear I'm cool and not a nerd."" A tangencial example is FromSoftware videogames, or Japanese videogames in general. On paper, a lot of stuff in Soulsborne games are flat out weird fiction. There are fewer artistic shackles. Or even the Yakuza games, if you wanna enter batshit territory. They're earnest and shameless.

>3: A lot of Hollywood writing, arguably the majority, is adaptations/remakes/sequels. So you got these writers who had to move to LA and serve coffee for dinosaurs in suits who eventually get a chance to actually write something. And it's not original work, which is what they likely dreamed of. So these creatively starved writers try to make the stories their own. Only they're inexperienced (because they never get to do original work), some might not have gotten the job purely out of artistic merit, and often they don't even like the source material that much. The result is a fanfic, only without the passion of an actual fanfic.

>4: ""Wokeness"" is a boogieman, but condescension is an actual problem. You have all these people, I don't know if the writers or the higher ups, who believe the audience has 0 media literacy and that depiction equals endorsement. Like a review of Dragonage: Veilguard said, it's like it's written by the HR department.

>5: Sometimes the stories get neutered from above, [like how Netflix tells its writers to make the character announce what they're doing](https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/), for the audience who're on their phones. This approach is inherently incompatible with the storytelling you see in books, because even the breeziest book requires full focus.",45,1737650413.0,Fantasy,24,0.8,False

However, that’s not allowed by my husband. I have to brew it outside. HOWEVER, he drinks mate every day. It feels hypocritical but he’s upset that I won’t just let it go and accept what he’s allowed me to do (or what he feels I’ve pushed over boundaries to do). 

We are in therapy but can never seem to work through this issue. 

Any advice? I’m aware it isn’t ideal and that boundaries are about him and not me, but man, I want to die on this hill. I don’t drink, I go to church with him every single Sunday, we pray as a family, I do the things for him. I feel like I’m allowed to die on this  hill.

I fill the lower pot with water, always below the valve, in insert the small funnel thing and the perforated coffee plate. I use a small tea spoon to put about 2 - 2 and a half spoons in the pot, aiming to fill the funnel below the rim. I put the pot on the stove, I was taught to use medium to high heat (electric stove), so that's what I do.

8 out of 10 times, regardless that I put seemingly the same amount of coffee in the funnel, the machine always shoots steam from the side. Image below shows where the steam escapes. What am I doing wrong?

I want to keep the machine because I have seen online how expensive new ones are.

Chapter 3 : Two new murders 

1 hour later, still at night, in his house Billy Lavington now an adult watches television sitting on his couch, suddenly, an individual wearing a white mask and a black hooded robe advances towards the couch from behind and begins to stab him ten times in the stomach with his knife, killing him. 

The next morning, James Leblanc's twin brother, Tony Leblanc, enters his office. 

- Tony, nice to see you again James said hugging him.

Entering this office, Lieutenant Hank O'Reilly is surprised at what he sees and says: 

- Is it me or am I seeing double?

- Lieutenant O'Reilly, this is my twin brother, Tony Leblanc said  James Leblanc. 

 Tony shakes one of Lieutenant O'Reilly's hands. 

Meanwhile, at another location in the precinct, former producer Jason Woosborrow is talking to a young blonde secretary sitting in a chair behind a desk.

- I want to see Chief Jensen, I need to talk to him about something important I discovered said Jason Woosborrow. 

- Chief Jensen is busy in a meeting, you could come back in the afternoon if you want said the young blonde secretary. 

Later in the afternoon in the police station, Tony Leblanc drinks a cup of coffee and puts it on a table, he no longer sees anyone in the police station which leads him to think that he is all alone, suddenly he sees a mysterious individual running towards him with a knife wearing the same disguise that he wore when he killed Billy Lavington.  

Panicking, Tony starts running to try to escape him but the mysterious disguised individual chases him running and he manages to stab him in one of his shoulders with his knife, he withdraws his knife and Tony Leblanc collapses on the ground, the mysterious disguised individual begins to stab him fifteen times, killing him too. 

Later that day at the police station, James Leblanc stands over the corpse of his twin brother Tony in a pool of blood, tears in his eyes. 

- I'm sorry, James said to Hank O'Reilly next to him.

- he was one of the only remaining members of my family said James Leblanc. 

Jason Woosborrow begins to reappear at the police station, saying: 

- I want to see Chief Jensen, where he is.

Suddenly Jason Woosborrow sees Lieutenant O'Reilly he also sees James Leblanc standing near the corpse of someone with the same face as him, he is surprised by this. 

- What happened here said Jason Woosborrow. 

- His twin brother Tony has just been killed, get out of here, I don't want civilians at a crime scene, Inspector James Leblanc needs to be left alone, you see that clearly said Lieutenant Hank O'Reilly.

Jason Woosborrow walks away from the crime scene as does Lieutenant Hank O'Reilly.

I feel like I need to compete with how pretty she is, and that is sort of a turn on for me. Before putting on my suit skirt, I went through my underwear drawer a few times to find a pair that were older. Before I gained the last 20lbs or so. All in my ass. When I pulled them on they pushed my cheeks  out and down, and as I walked, they crept up my ass. You could tell all of this when I pulled on my pinstriped mini skirt. I am in my 40's now, and I still like dressing sort of slutty. 

I worked with Katie all morning, noticing her ogling my boobs again. She is 22, and our new hire after her internship. She is extremely pretty, and I think she is into women as well. Either that or she is really jealous of my boobs.

After the Meeting with Diane, where all I could think about is whether she was wearing underwear as well, I left for the day. I stopped to get a coffee, then went to my home office and locked the door.

I began teasing my big areola's over my shirt until they stood up. I imagined being locked inside of Diane's office with the both of them. Someone mentions boobs falling out of bra's, and we all laugh. We start talking about times that this has happened to us, and Because min are F cups, I had more stories. I also imagined that they had a lot of questions.

I slowly unbuttoned my shirt in my office, and took my huge tits out of my shirt on at a time. Then I imagined each on of them Bent over somewhat, licking my nips, while looking up at me. I sucked each on of my tits, imagining them each pulling down their own panties, and playing as they licked.

Since I had been edging most of the day thinking about them, I was ready. I pulled up my skirt, grabbed my toy, bend over my desk, and went to town. Imagining Diane behind my with a strap on. Her tits swinging while Katie was licking them and playing with herself. 

""I need to come."" I whispered, then started pounding harder, Imagining Diane breaking a sweat. Her hips moving the toy in and out of me, begging. ""Come Allie, I need to see you come!""

My legs buckle and my tits slap against the desk one last time as I seize. Diane takes, off the toy and rubs quickly cuming just seconds after me, then Katie not helping it shutters as we all come together.

Since no one was home, I moaned out, then let the toy fall out of me. It took me a while before I could get up and walk. ",1,1737650166.0,u_Sure-Vast3352,0,1.0,True

Opening and Initial Impression:

The fragrance greets you with a bold and luxurious blend of resinous, oudy, sandalwood, and patchouli notes, enhanced by a touch of spices. This initial burst is rich, warm, and deeply aromatic, perfectly capturing the essence of a balsamic, woody, and oriental fragrance with spicy undertones.

Development and Longevity:

About 20-30 minutes after the initial spritz, the scent transitions into an oud-dominant profile. The oud is seamlessly complemented by patchouli and woody-aromatic nuances, creating a sophisticated and well-balanced composition. The fragrance maintains a linear character from this point, offering a consistent and elegant presence for the next 3-4 hours. As it dries down, it becomes a soft skin scent, with occasional whiffs of its earlier richness. It stays like this for a long time.

Occasions and Usage:

This fragrance shines best during evening occasions, such as intimate dinners or wine-and-dine settings. Its opulent and warm profile makes it a perfect companion for evening wear. For optimal performance, 7-8 sprays are more than sufficient, ensuring a noticeable yet refined sillage.

Personal Experience:

This is my first proper oud-based fragrance, and it has truly been a memorable introduction. It’s also my first experience with the house of Guerlain, and I am thoroughly impressed with the quality, craftsmanship, and elegance this scent exudes.

Notes as per Fragnatica:

Top Notes: Cardamom,  Angelica, Pink Pepper
Middle Notes: Black Pepper, Coffee
Base Notes: Sandalwood, Agarwood, Patchouli

And finally thanks to Infamous bhai for this excellent recommendation! Would love to explore more from this house 😃

Hello there! 

I would like to be intentional and looking for something long term, but in no rush to jump into a relationship. Wanting to truly get to know someone and build a connection. 

A bit about me: I am 27 never married, no kids, no past relationships, virgin. I would describe myself as kind, empathetic, open minded and open hearted, naturing, silly and sarcastic. 

I feel like I am terrible at describing myself so here’s some photos 😆: https://imgur.com/a/L2X0sNy

Area of study/work: I work in a hospital currently and wanting to go back to school still trying decide on what’s next for me. 

Hobbies/interests: I enjoy reading, baking, listening to music, thrifting, watching tv/movie’s, collecting vinyls, drinking too much tea/coffee,crafting. I am not the most outdoorsy person but I’m always up for adventure! 

Tell us a bit about your Christian journey: I have been Baptist all my life. I have moved a lot my whole life so going to church has not been something I’ve done routinely. I do feel like I’ve always carried my faith with me regardless. I currently have a church I mostly watch services virtually because of my schedule. 

What sort of person are you looking for?
I’m looking for someone funny, genuine, honest, someone of faith, family oriented, kind, compassionate, good listener,  empathetic, open minded. 

Age range: 25 to 35 years

Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate? Open to long distance possibly relocating just depends on the connection built.

\[the quiet murmur of a bookstore, distant coffee shop noises\]



\[strained a little, quiet and to self\] Hmm! I can…almost…reach this shelf…!



\[startled\] Oof! Oh! \[embarrassed\] Oh, sorry! Umm, thanks.



Hah, thank you, I thought I could reach that book on my own…Thanks for saving me from my own hubris, I guess! \[nervous giggle\]



Hah, yeahhh…I guess you’re right, if I had knocked over the shelf by overreaching I would have made way more trouble for you than just asking for the book in the first place, that’s fair.



Hmm? Oh, the book? I don’t know, I’ve never read it, a friend recommended it to me. 



…Noooo, I am *not* really into long descriptions of food and violence. Why, is that what this book is about?



…Oh, yeah. Hmm. Doesn’t really sound like my kind of story, that sucks. …Would you mind putting this book back for me?



Hah, thanks. I appreciate it! 



Oh? Would I like some recommendations of books that I might actually enjoy reading? Yeah, that would be great; if you don’t mind!



Let’s see, what kind of books do I like reading? Well, I am a big fan of mysteries or thrillers.



Yeah! I *love* detective novels. Anything with a female main character I will at least give a chance.



No, it doesn’t *have* to be only female mains, but I find it kind of easier to put myself in the main character’s shoes if they’re also a woman? Is that weird?



I guess, I just know some people don’t really care about that sort of thing so I wasn’t sure what was more typical. But yeah, detective or crime novels, but not really true crime. I like fake crime, fiction feels *way* safer than learning the sixty-seven ways a real life person has eviscerated, suffocated, or otherwise ruined the lives of victims who happen to be close to my age, build, and life experience…



Hah, right?! I mean, more power to people who are interested in true crime, but it freaks me out too much to feel comfy reading it.



What else do I like? Well, anything that has romance or a romance subplot. I am a huge sucker for like…supernatural romance novels.



No, I’ve never read the “True Blood” books, but I did watch the first four seasons of the show. It was fun for sure, but I don’t know if I would like the books themselves exactly. I did read some of another series that might be similar though?



\[embarrassed\] Hah, it might be a little embarrassing to admit, but…Have you heard of the “Anita Blake” series?



Really? You have? I’m just a little surprised because I thought they were kinda niche…and kinda super horny in the middle of the series, hence the embarrassment at admitting I like them.



No! \[quieter\] I mean, sorry, no. I don’t think *50 Shades of Grey* would be for me, hah. Just…not enough interesting character stuff, or plot, and too many inaccurate depictions of umm–



Yeah, exactly. I’m not anywhere near an expert on what that subculture is like, but I know that real life doms and subs have said it’s a bad portrayal of those kinds of relationships.



Yeah, you’re right, I’m probably looking more for something with an emphasis on character development and a really detailed focus on relationships if it’s going to \[quieter\] get spicy…



\[embarrassed\] No! I’m just…we’re in a bookstore, and you’re an employee of said bookstore, and you’re just trying to do your job. You don’t need the customer who is too short to reach the top shelf to tell you all of her turn-ons in public in order to make some book recommendations, right? That would be weird.



\[giggling\] Fair enough. I promise not to get too “weird” if you promise not to think I’m too weird.



I guess then I’m really looking for something with a separate plot from the romance, but the romance is still very present? And, a female main character who is a little more…submissive, I guess?



Yeah, I probably prefer a male love interest, but I don’t mind if they’re not! I am good with like fantasy or sci-fi, so it’s cool if the love interest is a robot or a ghost or…umm…yeah–



\[very embarrassed\] What?



No, I’m not…I just ran out of examples, that’s all!



\[super embarrassed\] Okay, okay, fine! Werewolves! \[quiet, embarrassed\] If the love interest is a werewolf that is a HUGE plus.



Stop laughing! I thought you promised not to think I’m weird!



Ugh, okay fine. Great. I just made the cute bookstore worker think that I am a furry, that’s SO much better.



\[laughing at herself a bit\] Don’t you have customers to check out or something?



\[sarcastic but not mean\] Wow, lucky me deciding to go to the local bookshop and being the only one in the store right now…But yeah, those are basically the things I like in a book! If you, you know, wanted to make any suggestions, or…



Okay, I’ll be here-ish. Just…looking around!



\[quiet, to self\] Way to go! Did you really call him cute to his face? And then call yourself a furry? This is SO why you are single.



Oh! Hi again. That was quick. Wow, I didn’t expect you to come back with so many recommendations…



\[confused\] Hah, okay? I mean, I don’t speak French, but…



\[polite, cheerful\] Okay, yeah! No problem at all, go take care of that! I’ll just be here in this chair checking out the books.



\[quiet, to self\] What did he mean…? One of these is in French and *might* have werewolves…?



\[sound of flipping through books\] Oh, here it is–\[embarrassed\] What?! \[even quieter\] Okay, I don’t read French…but…it says something about monsters…“in the air?” Wait, does that say “kama sutra”?! And what is the centaur on the cover doing? Is he…did he…? Did he paint a naked person just so he could give the painting head?! \[a pause\] Okay…so do I look through this to see *if* there are werewolves in it, or did he just bring me this because he was flirting? *Is* this flirting? I mean, it does *say* it’s a kama sutra…Okay, okay, just breathe. Get a grip, look at the other books, it’s fine…



Okay, let’s see…”A Cold Dark Place.” It says it’s “an FBI romantic thriller,” which, okay, sounds like my kind of thing…”When a series of brutal murders links to a cold case that is intensely personal for one FBI agent, she seeks help from a cybercrime expert who has his own secrets to hide.” Hmm, that sounds pretty good. A little bit like an episode of Criminal Minds or something. What else did he bring…?  
  


“You Shouldn’t Have Come Here,” hmm…“Grace Evans, an overworked New Yorker looking for a total escape from her busy life, books an Airbnb on a ranch in the middle of Wyoming.” Okay, not a detective novel I don’t think, but definitely a thriller…



And, lastly…\[a pause\] Okay, what’s the blurb say? “An aimless young woman starts writing to an accused serial killer while he awaits trial and then, once he's acquitted, decides to move in with him.” \[another pause\] \[quiet\] I kind of hate how much I’m interested in this one, “Love Letters to a Serial Killer.” Damn, he’s good.



\[flipping of the pages of a book\] \[startled\] Oh! Sorry, I totally jumped. You surprised me.



Yeah, I mean…The book recommendations are…well, either you are *really* good at telling what kinds of books your customers are interested in reading, or you’re trying to tell me that you’re secretly a stalker murderer criminal and you’re going to turn my skin into boots. \[a pause\] And you are *also* a furry.



\[laughing\] Okay, fair! Yeah, I guess I did give you some pretty easy parameters, hah. Yeah, I am definitely getting at least one or two of these. But, wait. Where on earth did the random French monster kama sutra come from?



Oh wait, really? I didn’t know there was a rare and old books section of the store!



Ohh, used books too. That makes sense. Still, kinda wild that you knew exactly where to find this one…



Okay, that’s fair. Did you win the competition? *Was* this the most niche book you or any of your coworkers could find?



Hah, congrats! \[polite clapping\] Kudos to you then.



\[intrigued but shy\] Do I want to go see the old books section? Is it in a different part of the store or something?



*Oh*, you need an employee to unlock it for you. \[a pause\] \[still shy but a little bit flirty\] Okay, sure. You haven’t steered me wrong yet!



\[a creaky door opening, then closing\] Whoa, you weren’t kidding. This place is magical! \[a deep breath\] This sounds so dumb, but this room *really* smells like “book!”



Yeah, I can see why you would love it back here. It’s like a maze! \[a pause\] So…you’ve given me books you think *I* would like. What is *your* favorite book back here?



Take the lead, I’ll follow.



\[pages turning\] Ooh, this one smells really good, hah. Is that weird?



No, I suppose someone who works with books would love “old book smell.” So, what’s this one about? It’s a hard back so there’s no summary on it.



\[flirty and a little shy but intrigued\] Okay…mhm…interesting. So what I’m hearing is: it’s about a couple…\[a little flirtier\] who met by chance…\[even flirtier\] and kept running into each other in public?



Oh, okay. Sorry, thank you for the clarification. They met *at the library*. Uh huh, I see. \[quiet and flirty and a little nervous\] You know…I didn’t even read the title. This book could be about anything at all and I wouldn’t know with the way you keep staring into my eyes…\[even quieter and more breathless\] But that’s okay, I don’t think another book recommendation is what I *need* right now…\[a kiss, which turns into another, which turns into making out\]



\[separating and catching her breath\] –Mmph. Hold on, I do still want these books, where can I put them down– \[books dropping lightly to the floor and more kissing\] You know, I would have expected \[another kiss\] someone who seems to care so much about books to take a little more care with these ones. \[more kisses\] I still have to buy them, you know. Aren’t you concerned about giving me the best customer service you can? \[more kissing and giggling as the audio fades out\]

Milatos might be the most underrated beach town in all of Crete. 
I know, bold statement. 
But hear me out, ok?
Milatos is this little slice of heaven tucked away on Crete&#8217;s northern coast, about 34km northwest of Agios Nikolaos and 16km east of Hersonissos.




It&#8217;s one of those places where you can still feel the authentic Cretan vibe, you know?
The village itself is super cute, with that traditional Greek charm that makes you want to stay forever.
But the real star of the show? 
That would be the Beach of Milatos, just a kilometer north of the main village.

Now, let me tell you about this cave near the village.
It&#8217;s not just any cave &#8211; it&#8217;s got some serious history.
Back in 1823, a bunch of locals were hiding from the Ottomans there, and well, let&#8217;s just say it didn&#8217;t end well.
These days, Milatos is way more chill.
It&#8217;s got this cool mix of traditional vibes and modern tourism.
The fishing port is still buzzing, and everywhere you look, there are these ancient olive groves.
And the coastline? 
Oh boy, it&#8217;s a playground of rocky coves and hidden beaches.

Milatos Beach Profile
Alright, let&#8217;s break down the beach scene in Milatos, because trust me, there&#8217;s more than meets the eye.
First up, about a kilometer east of the village, there&#8217;s this spot called Pigada.
It&#8217;s got these small, isolated bays with narrow strips of sand, surrounded by tall cliffs.
If you&#8217;re into that Robinson Crusoe vibe, this is your jam.
Just a heads up, the waves can get pretty wild here.
Moving towards the village, you&#8217;ll hit the main beach of Milatos.
It&#8217;s a good size, mostly pebbles with some rocky patches.
No fancy umbrellas or anything, but hey, you&#8217;re right next to the village amenities.
Again, watch out for those waves &#8211; they can get feisty.
Now, if you want something a bit more chill, head to the harbor beach.
It&#8217;s small and sandy, but it&#8217;s got some nice facilities.
This is where most people hang out because the water&#8217;s calm &#8211; perfect if you&#8217;ve got kids in tow.




Amenities
Milatos isn&#8217;t exactly a luxury resort town, but it&#8217;s got what you need for a comfortable beach day.
The main village is your go-to for most stuff.
You&#8217;ll find little shops for essentials, and there are a few tavernas where you can grab a cold drink or a snack.
The harbor beach is the most set up for tourists.
You can rent umbrellas and sunbeds there, and there are showers to rinse off the salt water.
If you&#8217;re staying at one of the hotels, like the Minos Imperial, they&#8217;ve got their own private beaches with all the fancy trimmings.




Accommodations
When it comes to places to crash, Milatos has got options for different tastes and budgets.
In the village, you&#8217;ll find some cute family-run guesthouses and small hotels.
These are great if you want that authentic Greek experience.
For something a bit more upscale, there are a few resort-style hotels along the coast.
The Minos Imperial is probably the fanciest, with its own private beaches and all that jazz.
If you&#8217;re more of a DIY traveler, there are also some vacation rentals and apartments available.




History and Significance
Okay, history buffs, this one&#8217;s for you.
Milatos isn&#8217;t just a pretty face &#8211; it&#8217;s got some serious backstory.
The village is built near where the ancient Minoan city of Milatos once stood.
This place was so important that Homer even mentioned it as one of the seven Cretan cities that sent troops to Troy.
But here&#8217;s where it gets wild &#8211; according to legend, Milatos was named after a boy who was raised by a wolf.
When he grew up, he killed the city&#8217;s tyrant and then headed off to Asia Minor to found the famous city of Miletus.
Fast forward to more recent history, and we&#8217;ve got the Milatos Cave.
In 1823, during the Greek War of Independence, it became a refuge for locals hiding from Ottoman forces.
Sadly, it ended in a massacre, making the cave a somber reminder of Crete&#8217;s struggle for freedom.




Activities
Milatos might be laid-back, but that doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s nothing to do.
First off, beach-hopping is a must.
Each little cove and bay has its own personality, so it&#8217;s fun to explore them all.
If you&#8217;re into snorkeling, the rocky areas around Pigada are pretty cool.
For history lovers, a visit to the Milatos Cave is a must.
It&#8217;s a bit of a hike, but totally worth it for the views and the sense of history.
In the village, you can watch the fishermen bring in their catch at the port.
And if you&#8217;re feeling adventurous, you can even arrange a fishing trip with one of the locals.
For a change of pace, take a walk through the olive groves surrounding the village.
It&#8217;s like stepping back in time.




Dining
Alright, foodies, listen up.
Milatos might be small, but it&#8217;s got some serious culinary game.
The harbor area is where you&#8217;ll find most of the action.
There are a handful of traditional tavernas right by the water.
Trust me, there&#8217;s nothing quite like fresh grilled fish with a view of the sea it came from.




Don&#8217;t miss out on trying some local Cretan specialties.
The dakos (kind of like a Greek bruschetta) is to die for, and if you&#8217;re feeling brave, give the octopus a go.
For a quick bite or a coffee, there are a couple of casual cafes in the village.
And if you&#8217;re staying at one of the bigger hotels, they usually have their own restaurants with a mix of local and international cuisine.
Make sure to check the official Crete government website for the latest travel updates and local regulations.




Best For Travelers
So, who&#8217;s Milatos perfect for? Well, it&#8217;s got a little something for everyone.
If you&#8217;re after a quiet, authentic Greek experience, this is your spot.
It&#8217;s great for couples looking for a romantic getaway without the crowds.
Families will love the calm waters of the harbor beach and the laid-back vibe of the village.
History buffs will get a kick out of exploring the cave and imagining the ancient city that once stood here.
And if you&#8217;re into photography, the mix of traditional architecture, rugged coastline, and crystal-clear waters is a dream come true.




Milatos Beach Map &#8211; Getting There
Getting to Milatos is pretty straightforward, but you&#8217;ll need to plan a bit.
The nearest airport is in Heraklion, about an hour&#8217;s drive away.
Renting a car is probably your best bet &#8211; it&#8217;ll give you the freedom to explore the area at your own pace.
If you&#8217;re not keen on driving, there are buses that run from Heraklion and Agios Nikolaos to Milatos.
They&#8217;re not super frequent, so check the schedule in advance.
You can also arrange a taxi or transfer through your accommodation, but this can be pricey.

Distances from Major Cretan Cities to Milatos:

Chania: Approximately 180 km (112 miles), about 2 hours 30 minutes drive
Rethymnon: Around 120 km (75 miles), about 1 hour 45 minutes drive
Heraklion: About 50 km (31 miles), roughly 45 minutes drive
Hersonissos: Approximately 16 km (10 miles), about 20 minutes drive
Malia: Around 10 km (6 miles), about 15 minutes drive
Agios Nikolaos: About 34 km (21 miles), roughly 40 minutes drive
Ierapetra: Approximately 70 km (43 miles), about 1 hour 15 minutes drive

Note: These are approximate distances and times. 
Actual travel times may vary depending on traffic and road conditions. 
Public buses are available from most of these cities to Milatos, but services may be limited. Renting a car is recommended for flexibility in exploring the area.




Tips
Alright, here are some insider tips to make your Milatos trip even better:
1. Bring water shoes. Some of the beaches are pebbly, and they can be tough on the feet.
2. Visit in shoulder season (May-June or September-October) for great weather without the crowds.
3. Rent a car if you can. It&#8217;ll make exploring the nearby coves and villages so much easier.
4. Learn a few Greek phrases. The locals really appreciate it, and it can lead to some great conversations.
5. Try the local wine. Crete produces some fantastic wines that you might not find elsewhere.
6. Bring cash. Not all places in Milatos accept cards, especially the smaller tavernas.
7. Pack a picnic and head to one of the more isolated beaches for a truly memorable day.

I used pearls on Regina's truffles because she was born with a silver spoon so I thought it would add a nice touch.

I used dark roast again because I'm giving them to coffee big drinkers.

A new guy moved into a couple months ago and he has an adorable shaggy haired floof. My girl will be glued to the window watching them everytime they walk. They finally met last week and they were so sweet to each other! He happened to mention at the time that his girl was a runner and escape artist…well

I’m drinking coffee this morning and my fur babies are going nuts (I thought it was because of the garbage truck) and they won’t stop. So I go look out my girls window and what do i see? That sweet neighbor floof was sitting by my steps directly under her window staring up at her🤣🤣 

I threw a jacket on and went out and walked her home and he and I had a good laugh about her escaping to try and set up her own play date. ",15,1737648880.0,husky,2,0.95,False
