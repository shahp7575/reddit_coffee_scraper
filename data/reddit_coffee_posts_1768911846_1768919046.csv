Like it says in the title, I’m hoping to find people to talk to during the day. It can get quiet and lonesome, and I love getting to know new and interesting people!

I’m a nerd in general , so feel free to talk nerdy to me, but my interests are broad and I can get into anything anyone else is passionate about. Science, philosophy, creative writing, gaming, working out, photography, cooking, F1 - these are all on the table to name just a few. 

I’m the kind of guy that savours his morning coffee, likes to do the crossword or wordle between sips, and enjoys those quiet moments. It would be nice to share those moments with another person. 

I am a fan of playful banter, shameless flirting and being an all around degenerate, but that’s not the main goal of this post. I am open to seeing where things go, but let’s take it slow, okay?

Interested in making friends with anyone, and open to more depending on how we vibe. Tell me how you like your coffee (or tea), or the last meal you made that you were proud of! Feel free to use chats or messages. Hope to hear from some of you soon!",1,1768918908.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Each box includes a mix of Maine-made food items, home goods, and small-batch products — all sourced from local small businesses around the state.

I’d love to:

* Get feedback on how the boxes look
* Hear what kinds of Maine-made products you think would be great to include
* Learn about any local makers or product types I might be missing

This is my first time ever moving to a new job. I have worked with my current team for two years. I know everyone in my department. I own my jobs. It's been challenging but I made it.

I will start the new job shortly. I am really anxious and scared to start the new job. Lately I would feel randomly nauseous and my heart would randomly race (maybe also bc of the coffee). My mind is restless and kept me awake late.

The new team and department are talented. The job offers quite a big pay raise and good benefits. I worry that I wont fit in or that I could not exceed the team's expectations. I feel so insecure since I don't have much experience. I am afraid I would disappoint.

I would appreciate your tips in managing the feelings, as well as practical tips to stay ahead of new jobs. Here are things that I have done:

* Understanding the business domain based on my discussion with the user
* Solve business-related problems

I work a standard 9-5 remote job. Our weekly all-hands meetings are, to put it politely, could-have-been-an-email territory. Usually, I just browse Reddit, but yesterday I found this site, **Flappy Fruit**.

It’s a Flappy Bird clone, but you play as different fruits. Simple enough, right? The problem is the ""one more turn"" syndrome.

I had the meeting audio in my headphones. I was on a solid run—passed 20, passed 30. The rhythm was hypnotic. I was playing as the pixelated apple. I approached a particularly nasty set of obstacles where the gap shifted significantly downward.

I tapped. I tapped again.

*Smack.* I hit the top pipe.

Without thinking, I loudly exclaimed ""NO! COME ON!"" threw my hands up, and knocked my mouse off the desk.

Then I saw the ""You are talking while muted?"" notification... except I wasn't muted. I had unmuted to say ""Good morning"" at the start and forgot to toggle it back. The CEO stopped talking. 50 people were looking at my webcam.

I panicked and said, ""Sorry, I... spilled coffee on my cat.""

Anyway, I still haven't beaten my high score of 38. If anyone wants to help me validate that this game is worth risking your career over, please try it.

1qi26fm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiaryOfARedditor/comments/1qi26fm/real_190126_another_day_for_sprint_2/,[REAL] (19/01/26) Another day for sprint 2,"The night was mild and quiet, the air lingering at 23°C around midnight. Passing clouds moved lazily across the sky, barely disturbing the stillness. By early morning, the temperature dipped slightly to 21°C. The world outside seemed calm, the faint warmth of approaching day already pressing against the edges of sleep.

I arrived at the office around 8:00 a.m. The building was familiar, three floors rising quietly above the street. I stepped into the second floor, my usual space, and immediately noticed the blinds on the windows along the left wing were down. I opened them, letting morning light spill in. The sunlight felt soft and even, a reminder that even small adjustments could change the atmosphere completely. I walked toward the pantry on the right wing, preparing breakfast. The air smelled faintly of coffee and bread, quiet but alive with small movements as others prepared for the day. After finishing, I returned to my seat, only to find the blinds already lowered again. I opened them once more, hoping they would stay, so I could work without the office feeling dim. It remained a minor struggle, a constant negotiation with the space. The glare never bothered me, but the darkness when the blinds were down made the environment feel constricted, almost stifling. I tried to keep them open all day, adjusting as needed when someone lowered them again.

Between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m., I sat at my desk, not entirely sure where to start. The rhythm of the office was slow. I asked my counsellor from HR whether I could claim mileage for the company engagement on Saturday. She confirmed it was fine, and I proceeded to submit the claim. The approval process required three steps: first HR, then the unit head, and finally the section head. The procedure felt bureaucratic but straightforward, leaving me with a quiet satisfaction in completing it properly.

From 10:00 a.m. to noon, the focus shifted to backlog grooming. I reviewed user stories with the team, analyzing technical requirements and prioritizing what needed attention. My mind wandered at times, noting small inefficiencies or inconsistencies in how tasks were described, but the session pressed forward with methodical pace. The blinds behind me remained open, sunlight slowly moving across the office floor, highlighting the textures of my desk and the subtle creases in my chair.

Lunch stretched from 12:00 to 2:00 p.m. I ate slowly, letting the warmth of the sun through the windows and the quiet hum of the office fill the space. The meal felt restorative. After eating, I allowed myself to relax for a short while, catching glimpses of colleagues walking past or chatting quietly in corners, the sounds muted by distance.

Back at my desk from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m., backlog grooming continued. The stories we reviewed were technical and demanding. Chee Kian would review all user stories before any changes could be made, which limited our ability to adjust them on the spot. The office remained quiet except for the soft tapping of keyboards and occasional muted conversations. They told us that the company engagement from Saturday counted as training, so no overtime could be applied. I accepted this, filing it mentally as a small limitation but one I could manage. The blinds occasionally lowered on their own, but I adjusted them whenever I could, preferring natural light to artificial brightness.

The unit head and section head were not present today, a relief that allowed me to maintain calm. Their absence removed the underlying tension that had occasionally unsettled me in the past. I noticed that my emotions remained steady. Past anxiety seemed less intense, almost absent, though a small part of me still wished they would not be in the office at all. The space felt easier to inhabit without them.

By 5:00 p.m., the workday ended. I packed my things, closed my laptop, and left the office. The walk to the car was quiet, the air outside warm and still, carrying faint scents of urban morning mixed with late afternoon calm. I arrived home around 6:00 p.m. and did not eat dinner, still full from the previous day’s company engagement. I settled into a slow, gentle rhythm, letting the heat outside and the quiet of my apartment blend into a feeling of repose.

From 9:00 to 11:00 p.m., I played games and watched Twitch streams, letting the day dissolve into entertainment and distraction. The glow of the screen, the quiet tapping of keys, and the occasional sound from the headset created a controlled environment where I could rest, unwind, and reset. By 11:00 p.m., I turned off the computer and went to bed. Fatigue was present but calm, a lingering effect from Saturday’s event and the steady, quiet work today. The passing clouds outside marked the night, indifferent and constant, much like the rhythm of my own thoughts.

The day had no dramatic spikes or conflicts, only small challenges, minor irritations, and moments of quiet satisfaction. The office blinds, the bureaucracy of mileage claims, the meticulous review of backlog items, and the absence of difficult personalities shaped the day into one of subdued productivity and calm endurance.",1,1768918461.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

I’ve built teams, failed gracefully, led responsibly, and learned that stability is not the absence of chaos — it’s the ability to hold space for it.

What I offer isn’t a fairytale or a fling disguised as depth. It’s presence, mentorship, and partnership — the kind that makes room for both ambition and softness. I’ve been the guy people call when they’re stuck on career crossroads, mental burnout, or startup dilemmas, and I’ve found meaning in being the calm in other people’s storms.

I’m deeply feminist — not as a label, but as a lens. I want a partner who believes in shared growth, equal agency, and conversations that challenge both of us. Someone curious, grounded, emotionally literate, and confident in her contradictions — who can talk strategy one moment and stare at the stars the next.

I find joy in teaching, long drives at dusk, a clean room after chaos, and building things that last. I don’t mind being the stable one; I just hope you value it too.

What we can do: walk through a flea market, brainstorm your next idea over coffee, or simply talk about what ""balance"" means to you. I won’t rush connection — but I’ll respect your time and energy like they’re gold.

I’m a guy in my 20s (feel free to ask for exact age) living in North Rhine-Westphalia, and I’m looking to make some new friends in Münster or Düsseldorf. I’m into Japanese street fashion like Jirai Kei (including the male version, Jirai Danshi – think edgy, cute, and explosive vibes with accessories, oversized clothes, and maybe some makeup). Would love to connect with people who are into cosplay, fashion experiments, or just chilling in styled outfits.

We could do meetups like:

•  Cosplay photoshoots or trying out outfits together (nothing too intense, just fun!)

•  Casual walks around town, maybe in Little Tokyo in Düsseldorf or parks in Münster.

•  Grabbing coffee, chatting about anime, games, or language learning (I’m studying German and play piano too).

Open to guys, girls, or anyone – platonic friendships only. I can chat in English, German (intermediate), or Russian. If you’re Japanese or into J-culture, even better!

DM me if interested, or comment below. Let’s make some plans! 😊

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

No box, no manual, just decades of coffee history 😅

After some digging (and a lot of grime), I realized it’s a Vandel – Made in Italy moka pot. Apparently not as famous as Bialetti, but legit old-school Italian aluminum.

It’s:

Octagonal, stovetop

Likely a 3-cup

Original parts still inside (gasket is… not great)

Filter is partially clogged

Some classic aluminum oxidation going on

Honestly, it looks like it brewed coffee for an entire generation and then got forgotten.

I’m planning to:

Replace the gasket (probably silicone)

Swap the filter plate

Do a proper deep clean and seasoning

Brew a few sacrificial rounds before real coffee

Before I go full restoration mode —

Anyone here familiar with Vandel moka pots?

Worth restoring vs buying a modern Bialetti?

Any tips for getting the best brew out of old aluminum pots?

Also curious: does anyone else have moka pots passed down from parents/grandparents? I feel like these things are basically family heirlooms in Italy.

At one point it became so automatic that it was just my muscle memory at one point, like my thumb remember to unlock the phone. I was literally spending 6-7 hrs a day on my phone scrolling without any reason. Scroll, open ig/yt/reddit close then open again, close then the loop goes on.

Does anyone else also just feel exhausted all the time no matter what they do? 

Like i sit with my coffee and plan my day like I'm some kind of CEO or what planning my day on the notes app. It does looks productive, but somehow I still do absolutely nothing. Hours just vanish into scrolling random a$$ sh\*t on ig reels or yt shots and then i feel worse like I'm stuck in an infinite loop fr.

My energy is unpredictable. Like on some days i get these random bursts and my brain wants to do everything at once. Other times i just scroll for 6 hours straight. either way, my to-do list laughs at me.

even the “just do one small thing” advice feels heavy when your energy’s shot. and when i do get a rare window of energy? i waste it switching between apps like a maniac until it’s gone. rinse. repeat.

but here’s what kinda helped without deleting any apps:

i moved all the scroll traps aka social apps (insta, reddit, youtube etc.) off my home screen and buried them deep in a random folder. Replaced that space with notes, calendar, or just boring apps. dude, also use that black and white/grayscale mode i assure you that you don't wan use your phone no longer. And do some sort of physical activity be it walking or just anything that requires your body to make a movement.

i also stopped scheduling by time and started planning to do it in the exact moment I feel like doing it.

i’m still figuring stuff out.I don’t feel totally fixed, but i feel less like i’m drowning. Sowhat actually worked for y’all?

Like genuinely. any real methods, habits that helped you function better with chaotic energy and low motivation?

pls no productivity-guru bs. just the stuff that helped you feel like a human again, do drop it below. i’d be super grateful

1qi1zvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1qi1zvy/i_cant_have_a_close_relationship_with_mil/,I can’t have a close relationship with MIL,"My MIL is a very sweet woman, she’s happy, organised, dealing with health problems and essentially carrying the house, cooks meals everyday etc. She had always wanted a close relationship with her future DIL. She wanted me to be like her daughters, to feel as close as another daughter, for me to be part of the family.

That being said, she can also be very controlling. She doesn’t expect me to change in one day, baby steps and progress. Some examples are:

1. Saying she won’t invite her family out of embarrassment if I wear the wedding dress I wanted to

2. Initially had the dream of moving with her son + DIL, retire together. Has given up on it since.

3. Wanted me to change my name (religious significance) both DH and I cut it out as soon as. Suggested naming our baby in future because it’s tradition.

Wanted me to wear traditional clothes around the house because I’m a new bride.

Wanted me to join her to coffee dates, shopping, visiting family, long chats, emphasising it’s all without DH. Saying our relationship does not depend on him.

Once shouted at me for wearing something transparent. Husband was there and told her to cut it out immediately. 

Eat dinners together everyday (6 person family), breakfast on weekends, weekly family events out.

Wants us to go to family events as a family together, arriving at the same time on the same day etc. You don’t get invited as a couple, you get invited as a family. 

Wanted me to greet them everytime I arrived/ left the house (we live with them), DH even suggested I go to her room to greet her/ have chats with her, get comfortable. (I did say no to these as it’s way too suffocating for me).

For context. I come from a very conservative, abusive family, both in religion and relationship. I was raised with very strict rules and never built a close relationship with my mother.

I had since left and ‘freed’ myself from these expectations and now struggling to build a relationship, while being accepted for being different.

However I’ve found myself in a similar position with another controlling mother. This whole experience made me retreat and extremely uncomfortable with being myself. Coupled with my inability to express within my own family, and now essentially having to meet more expectations (otherwise I’m viewed as disrespectful), I’m extremely uncomfortable with even showing up as anything. Be it my own clothes, traditional clothes, going to family events, saying no to going. I feel stuck in discomfort. I say no to most things because there were so many, and yes occasionally. 

Now all of these points above have mostly since been dropped by MIL. She has given up trying to make us be with her + family all the time, giving space to do things as a couple. But she maintains her traditions about going to family events with a collectivist mentality, and wearing traditional clothes to her standard because it’s her family. 

That I married into HIS family and this is how things are done. 

DH says because it’s her own side of the family, she gets to have those expectations of me. The same way id take my shoes off entering someone’s house because it’s what they deem respectful. I see the logic but clothing is such a huge part of my identity, something that was always controlled in my past. I cannot compromise on this, besides show up as modest which is bare minimum for them.

Besides this she simply wants me to feel part of the family, she wants me to put efforts be more involved. She now understands I don’t have much time to give to others anyways due to my full time job + some weekends. I don’t visit my parents or siblings as often as I see them (everyday as I live with them + family events). 

She feels the disconnect of me not genuinely participating emotionally, being physically present enough. She wants me to care about her family more. I feel miserable living with them, eating with them. (+ battling with mild depression and in therapy)

I find it very hard to have more than a formal relationship with her due to her controlling nature in general, or previous times where I’ve went out with her + she brought up expectations of how to be a DIL, more involved, get more comfortable. Yes she can have a lovely side to her, but I find it hard to overlook what she’s done previously. 

That being said I can still engage in conversation when it comes to it over dinners, around the house etc. But I won’t carve time out of my day to make time for her and the family. I don’t suggest or plan anything with the family either. 

I feel like she’s not letting me be a part of the family in the way I’d feel comfortable. + I’m not letting myself be part of the family in a way which feels comfortable.

She came in head on, while maintaining everything comes out of love and with time. I have since retreated and desperately trying to move out with DH.

I’m not sure what the way forward is. I’m not sure how effort looks to her anymore. My standard is her below minimum..",3,1768918010.0,Mildlynomil,0,1.0,False

We all know the phase, nothing is really wrong, but everything is mildly annoying for some reason.

After 2 months of awkwardly tiptoeing around each other, we had a conversation and decided that enough is enough. We made this super-extra-mega elaborate plan...... Just kidding, we decided that every day before work, we would get up an extra half an hour early and go to the local cafe to have coffee together. Sounds simple enough. The only challenging part about it was finding a cafe that uses both ROA Barista oat milk and Rude Health almond milk, because those are me and my partner's preferred plant milk brands. 

Suddenly, we weren't snapping at each other or fighting. Just sitting down for coffee every morning, enjoying each other's company and, to make things interesting, making fun of each other's coffee orders (I still do not understand how she finds almond milk tasty).",3,1768918005.0,barista,1,1.0,False

I'm 32F, live alone, decent job, nothing dramatic on paper. Somewhere along the way I became the default calm one in my friend group and family. The one who answers the late-night texts. The one who shows up when someone is crying in their car. The one who can listen to the same story again and still say the right thing. People tell me ""I don't know how you stay so steady"" and I do that little laugh like it's a compliment.

But I'm not steady. I'm just quiet. I swallow it, and then I go home and stare at my ceiling like an idiot.

My mom calls when she's anxious, which is.. often. My cousin vents about school and panic attacks. Two friends are going through breakups and I keep getting the ""can I call you for five mins?"" message that turns into an hour. Even at work I'm the person who de-escalates everyone because I don't get visibly mad. I'm the ""reasonable"" one. The ""level headed"" one. And yeah, I get it, it means people trust me. I should be grateful. But I'm so tired I can feel it in my teeth sometimes, this tight buzzing like I've had too much coffee but I haven't.

And the part that stings is how one-sided it feels. If I try to talk about my own stuff, it just kind of.. dies. Not in a cruel way, more like people don't know what to do when it's me. I'll say something small like ""I've been having a rough week"" and they reply with a meme or a quick ""aw babe"" and then back to their crisis. Or they do the instant fix thing, like ""you should start going to the gym"" (no thanks) or ""just take a weekend trip"" (with what energy). So I stopped bringing it up because it feels embarrassing to even ask for space.

I notice I do this even with strangers. Like I can be at a coffee place and the barista is clearly having a day, and I become the warm patient girl who says it's fine, take your time. Then I walk out and I'm like why am I taking care of everyone. Why can't I just exist without performing ""together"".

Last week a friend told me ""you're the only stable person I know, I'm lucky you're in my life."" And I almost cried, not because it's sweet, but because I realized I'm trapped in that role. If I ever fall apart, I feel like I'm letting everyone down. And then the selfish part of me gets angry, like why is my job to be a human life jacket for everyone else.

I'm not asking for solutions, I don't want advice. I just needed to say it somewhere: I feel used, even by people I love, and I hate myself for resenting them. I want someone to ask me how I'm doing and actually stay for the answer, not just wait their turn to talk. I want to not be the responsible one for like, a month. I want to be allowed to be messy without feeling guilty.

And then I feel pathetic writing that, which is probably the whole problem.

studied everything from attachment theory to neurodivergence research to random 3am psychology podcasts, and turns out there's actual science behind why some of us feel perpetually out of place. and more importantly, how to fix it without completely changing who you are.

**the ""different"" feeling usually comes from mismatched social calibration**

most people who feel chronically different aren't actually that weird. they just learned social patterns from environments that don't match where they are now. maybe you grew up in a chaotic household so you're hyper-vigilant to mood shifts. maybe you moved countries as a kid. maybe you just have a brain that processes things slightly differently.

dr gabor maté talks about this in [scattered minds](https://www.amazon.com/Scattered-Minds-Origins-Attention-Disorder/dp/1785042211) (dude's a trauma expert who's worked with everyone from addicts to adhd patients). he breaks down how early disconnection creates these invisible walls we carry into every interaction. not your fault. just your nervous system trying to protect you from past stuff that isn't even happening anymore.

the book absolutely wrecked me in the best way. it's less about ""here's how to make friends"" and more about understanding why connection feels so damn hard in the first place. best book on feeling like an outsider i've ever touched.

**stop performing, start filtering**

here's what actually worked. instead of trying to fit in everywhere, i started being more myself and letting that naturally filter for compatible people. sounds stupidly simple but most ""different"" people do the opposite. we chameleon so hard we attract people who like our mask, not us.

polly young-eisendrath (she's a jungian psychologist, wrote a bunch on authenticity) says the goal isn't to connect with everyone. it's to connect deeply with people who actually get you. quality over quantity isn't just instagram caption BS when it comes to relationships.

**vulnerability as a sorting mechanism**

[brené brown's podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/4P86ZzHf7EOlRG7do9LkKZ) unlocking us has an episode on belonging that completely shifted how i approach connection. she interviewed harriet lerner about selective vulnerability, basically sharing progressively deeper things and seeing who sticks around.

you don't trauma dump on strangers. but you also don't hide every slightly unconventional part of yourself. mention that weird documentary you're obsessed with. share the unpopular opinion. talk about the thing you're genuinely excited about even if it's niche.

people who vibe with real you will lean in. people who don't will fade out. that's the point.

**find your specific weird**

this sounds counterintuitive but connection got easier when i stopped trying to relate to ""normal people activities"" and just found communities around my specific interests. there's literally a group for everything now.

used an app called [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/apps/) to find actual local groups. didn't force myself into generic ""young professionals networking"" stuff. found a philosophy book club and a hiking group that wasn't obsessed with instagram photos. suddenly i was around people who also preferred deep conversations about random topics over small talk about the weather.

reddit's probably the easiest for this honestly. find your niche subreddit, lurk, comment, eventually some of those digital connections can become real ones.

**the attachment style thing**

had to mention this because it explained SO much. took the attachment style quiz on the personal development school app (they have like thousands of videos on relationship patterns). turns out anxious and avoidant attachment styles both create that ""i don't belong"" feeling but for opposite reasons.

anxious types feel different because they're constantly scanning for rejection. avoidant types feel different because they've learned to disconnect preemptively. knowing which pattern you run helps you catch it mid-interaction instead of just feeling vaguely wrong all the time.

thais gibson who runs that platform is insanely knowledgeable about how childhood stuff translates to adult connection problems. her content's more practical than theoretical.

[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI-powered personalized learning app built by Columbia grads and AI experts from Google. You type in what you want to work on, like improving social skills or understanding attachment patterns better, and it pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create custom audio content just for you. 

What's useful here is you can adjust the depth. Start with a 10-minute overview of something like polyvagal theory or attachment styles, and if it clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and context. The voice options are pretty addictive too, everything from calm and soothing to more energetic styles depending on your mood. There's also this virtual coach called Freedia that you can actually talk to about your specific struggles, and it builds an adaptive learning plan based on that. Helped clarify a lot of the psychology concepts I was trying to piece together from different sources.

**mirror neurons and the feedback loop**

here's the neuroscience bit. mirror neurons make us unconsciously mimic people we're with. if you're tense because you feel different, others pick up on that tension and mirror it back. then you feel more different because everyone seems uncomfortable. vicious cycle.

breaking it requires consciously relaxing your body during interactions. sounds too simple but the polyvagal theory stuff (stephen porges research) shows our nervous systems literally communicate safety or threat to each other without words.

i started doing box breathing before social situations. four counts in, hold four, out four, hold four. gets you out of that low key fight or flight state that makes you seem ""off"" to others.

**stop explaining yourself**

this one's subtle but important. people who feel different often over-explain their choices, their opinions, their existence. it actually makes you seem less confident and more different.

just state things plainly. ""i don't drink"" instead of ""oh i don't drink because xyz medical reason plus i just never liked the taste and also hangovers are terrible for me specifically because."" people mostly don't care about the why as much as you think.

**the friendship initiation thing**

research from university of kansas found it takes roughly 50 hours to move from acquaintance to casual friend, 90 hours to become real friends, and 200+ for close friendship. most people who feel chronically different give up way before hitting those thresholds.

they have one slightly awkward interaction and assume the person doesn't like them. or they wait for the other person to initiate everything. connection requires repeated exposure and someone has to drive that.

i started using the ""two follow-ups"" rule. if i met someone cool, i'd suggest grabbing coffee. if that went well, i'd invite them to something else within two weeks. most people want more friends but nobody wants to seem desperate by initiating, so someone has to.

**your ""different"" might be your depth**

lot of people who feel different are just operating at a different depth than surface level socializing. they want to talk about ideas and feelings and weird hypotheticals, not just weekend plans and weather.

that's not better or worse, just different compatibility. the fix isn't becoming more shallow. it's finding people who also prefer depth and being patient enough to find them.

took me way longer than i'd like to admit to realize feeling different wasn't a defect. it was just a mismatch between who i am and who i was trying to connect with. once i actually started selecting for genuine compatibility instead of trying to force connection everywhere, everything got easier.

She has been going through a rough phase for the past 3-4 years, and the last 10 days had been extremely stressful and exhausting. She's very tired and needs a good break from everything.

Today, on my way to drop her off, we stopped at Kanchi Cafe for a quick coffee break and discussed a lot of things.

Most of our careers are ALMOST self-made, and we are very independent, with VERY LITTLE help from our parents. We don’t stay in touch with our paternal relatives (a large group) due to family issues, and maintain a very small circle of friends. We’ve been through a lot of family trauma and drama since our childhood.

Even though we’re earning and standing on our own today, we don’t always feel happy and still get very emotional at times, wondering why our lives turned out this way.

To be honest, there’s so much behind us that we’ve almost forgotten what family happiness/love even feels like.

But it doesn’t always fit every situation, and repeating it all the time can get boring and sound very repetitive. So here I’ve written a variety of different alternatives that will help you diversify your speech and sound more natural.

Stronger than “Me gusta” (Passion)

When you don't just ""like"" it, but you really love it.

* Me encanta: Me encanta tu vestido. → I love your dress.
* Me fascina: Me fascina la historia de este lugar. → I am fascinated by the history of this place.
* Me apasiona: Me apasiona cocinar. → I am passionate about cooking.
* Me vuelve loco/a: Me vuelve loca esta canción. → This song drives me crazy (in a good way) / I’m wild about it.

Curiosity

Use these when something captures your attention or you find it interesting.

* Me interesa: No me interesa el fútbol. → I’m not interested in soccer.
* Me llama la atención: Me llama la atención ese libro. → That book catches my attention.
* Me intriga: Me intriga saber qué pasó. → I am intrigued to know what happened.
* Me atrae: Me atrae la idea de viajar solo. → The idea of traveling alone appeals to me.

Enjoyment (Activities)

Instead of saying you “like” an activity, you can say you “enjoy” it.

* Disfruto (de): Disfruto de un buen café por la mañana. → I enjoy a good coffee in the morning.
* Pasarlo bien: Siempre lo paso bien contigo. → I always have a good time with you.
* Entretenerse: Me entretiene ver documentales. → Watching documentaries entertains me.

Colloquial / Slang

Want to sound like a local? Try these region-specific options.

* Me mola (Spain): Me mola tu estilo. → I dig your style / Your style is cool.
* Me flipa (Spain): Me flipa esta serie. → I’m obsessed with this show.
* Me copa (Argentina): Me copa esa idea. → I dig that idea / I’m down for that.
* Me trama (Colombia): Me trama esa película. → I’m really into that movie.

**Tip**: Specific Verbs for Specific Contexts

For People (Platonic): Me gusta implies romantic attraction!

* Me gusta Juan. → I am attracted to Juan. ❤️
* Me cae bien Juan. → I like Juan (he is nice/friendly).

For Plans/Agreement:

* Me parece bien. → That seems good to me.
* Me apetece. → I feel like / I am in the mood for…

For Food:

* La sopa está rica. → The soup is tasty.
* ¡Qué delicioso! → How delicious!.

1qi1v1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1qi1v1m/our_first_voyage_radiance_of_the_seas_review/,"Our First Voyage, Radiance of The Seas Review","We (27M) and (25F) just finished a 4 night voyage to Grand Bahama and Nassau on Radiance of the Seas. We’d give our 1st cruise a 6.5/10 overall with some highs and lows. 

Top Pros:

\-Snorkeling excursion (Nassau) 10/10  

\-Izumi Restaurant

\-Schooner Bar

Top Cons:

\- Windjammer/main dinning hall food 

\- Grand Bahama

\- Limited age appropriate (mid 20s) activities 

Bonus con: sea-sickness

\- on the 1st and last night when crossing into the Bahamas from Fort Lauderdale and on returning there was pretty significant rocking and rolling of the ship. It wasn’t \*horrible\* but even with dramamine was uncomfortable for several hours. 

If you have any ability to feel sea sick or motion sick know that there will likely be periods of time where you \*will\* feel uncomfortable. What helped us the most when feeling that way was to walk around outside in the fresh air. We found it was best in the middle of the boat, so if possible, you may want to get a room closer to the middle. 

Here is a further breakdown of our experience:

Dining

\- We were not fans of the Main Dining Room. We found that the food was just plated food from the windjammer, with a faux-fancy feel

\- The windjammer made to order stir fry was the best thing we had from there

\- Izumi was great and the pre-fix absolutely worth the money. Especially when bought on black Friday for $25 a person! 

\- getting specialty coffee in the solarium was perfect 

\- Windjammer breakfast and lunch was underwhelming. Almost nothing was very flavorful or interesting. Fine for little kids, but they seemed to have excelled at visual appeal and not actual taste. Except the Indian food, and made to order stir fry it was all bland and tasteless. 

\- Cold water was somewhat hard to come by. Ice water was available in the windjammer & solarium. They strangely dissuaded you from filling your water bottle pretty much everywhere. 

Customer Service

\-Excellent, the staff were all professional and very kind. Many remembered you by name and would have small nice conversations with you throughout the cruise. 

Port stops

\- Not much going on in Freeport, unfortunately. We had hoped to go to one of the nature reserve areas, but were dissuaded by a member of the crew telling us that it wasn’t worth it. Hopped off the boat to walk around the small port area and spent the rest of the day on the boat. 

\- Nassau was great! We walked to the Queen’s staircase and grabbed a great local lunch before our excursion. We had a great time snorkeling! The catamaran boat ride and hour long snorkeling session was the absolute highlight of our trip. 

Onboard Activities

\- Favorites: Rock climbing, Solarium (adult indoor pool), Arcade area, Seven Hearts (game room), chess in the Colony Club

\- We found that most activities were geared toward kids/families (as expected) and an older crowd than us. The themed nights were 70s and 80s nights, and the trivia/dance parties were themed the same way. Not an issue, but wish there was a bit more activity to appeal to the age group between those crowds. 

\- We were surprised that on the at-sea day, there were fewer activities than there were on the other days. The majority of activities on our final day were sales at the shops. 

TL/DR: overall a good experience we may not repeat for at least several decades. Meh food, fun snorkeling, great service.  ",1,1768917677.0,royalcaribbean,0,1.0,False

Live Denny Triangle and Work in Bellevue?,"Hi All - I've been reading moving posts in this sub for the last two months and would appreciate any feedback on my situation:

* Moving to Seattle next month from Boise, ID, and I wanted to spend the first year living downtown to get to know the city
* Mid-40s single guy, no pets
* Want to find 1 bedroom at least 700 sqft, up to $3.2k including parking
* I have a car I'm bringing with me
* Work in downtown Bellevue, but I am 50% in office and 50% at home, and the in office hours I can flex to start earlier, say 6:30am/7am, and leave at 3:30pm

Am I making a mistake living that far from work? I know there are plenty of rentals that meet my criteria within walking distance of my office in Bellevue, but I'm excited to move the Seattle, not Bellevue, which has a much different feel in my limited experience. I do prefer walkability where I live along with mass transit access, and the Denny Triangle area seems like a good jumping off point, plus it has an easy walk to Westlake station, and with the Link 2 line extending into Seattle hopefully in May, gives me a work transit option versus driving. 

I am aged out of the bar scene and enjoy running, hiking, and playing tennis, so keeping my car for evening or weekend use to those activities but otherwise love the idea of being car-free ""lite"" the rest of the time so I can walk to restaurants, coffee shops, and the waterfront/events.

1qi1suc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BerriBot/comments/1qi1suc/how_berri_mastermind_eliminates_subjective_bias/,How Berri Mastermind Eliminates Subjective Bias in Interviews,"**Imagine two candidates.**

https://preview.redd.it/rizone9zfieg1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ad7066b28f520df08145a5b78c00a6494ae098

The first candidate is interviewed on a Tuesday morning by a panel who just had a great cup of coffee and is feeling fresh and energized.

The second is interviewed on a Friday afternoon by that same panel, who is now tired and thinking about the weekend. Without meaning to, the panel might be warmer to the first candidate and more reserved with the second.

This is the reality of human bias. It isn't intentional, but it is there, hidden in our tone, our energy levels, and even the way we phrase a question.

At BerriBot, we believe that a person’s career shouldn't depend on the time of day they were interviewed or the mood of the person across the table. We are moving toward a model where fairness is built into the process by default.  


**A Consistent Space for Everyone**

Through Berri Mastermind, we have created an environment where every candidate meets the same version of the interviewer. Whether it’s 9 AM or midnight, the AI remains patient, objective, and empathetic.  


**Standardized Questioning:** 

Every candidate for a specific role is asked the same core questions, phrased in the exact same way. This removes the leading questions that humans often accidentally use when they like someone’s initial vibe.  


**A Neutral Tone:** 

Berribot Mastermind doesn't get tired or impatient. It maintains a steady, encouraging tone that allows the candidate’s actual skills, rather than their ability to read the room to shine through.   


**Objective Evaluation:** 

Instead of relying on a gut feeling, the AI evaluates responses based on standardized technical and behavioral benchmarks. This ensures that the quiet candidate with great ideas is valued just as much as the charismatic one.  


**Scaling Fairness**

Bias is often a by-product of scale. When a team has to interview thousands of people, exhaustion makes it harder to stay objective.   


To solve this, we automated the initial rounds. As a result, we don't just save time for panels to have meaningful conversations; we protect the integrity of the choice.  


Our goal isn't to replace the human element of hiring, but to refine it. We want to clear away the noise of unconscious bias so that when a recruiter finally meets a candidate, they are meeting someone who earned their spot through true potential alone.  


Hiring is about finding the right person for the team. We’re just here to make sure everyone gets a fair chance to show they are that person.

Hi there! I’m a 27-year-old cute and slim transwoman, living in the world of fashion and photography. I love good light, good coffee, and conversations that go deeper than small talk. Curious, stylish, and a little playful—I enjoy exploring new places and new ideas.

You can check my pics on my profile

I’m 5’6”, normal bmi, and drawn to men who are confident, fit, and masculine, yet kind and witty enough to keep up with my sass. Bonus if you’ve got that “I’ve-got-this” energy and a warm smile.
Please be conversationalist, non smoker and financially capable. 

If you reach out, share your ASL, a quick intro, and something unique about you. Let’s see where creative meets masculine—maybe over coffee, maybe more. 🌙✨

1qi1jvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dashcamindia/comments/1qi1jvz/are_you_seeking_whats_aim_of_life/,are you seeking what's aim of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I wanted to share my journey into the wild world of entrepreneurship, because honestly, it’s been a trip and a half. It all started back in college. While everyone else was hitting the books or partying, I was in my dorm room, surrounded by beads, wire, and a mountain of half-finished jewelry. I decided to start a small online store, mostly because I loved making stuff and needed some extra cash that didn't involve waiting tables.

Those early days were a blur of late-night crafting sessions, fueled by instant coffee and sheer stubbornness. I'd be meticulously bending wire one minute, then diving into YouTube tutorials on SEO and website design the next. My fingers often ached, and my eyes would burn from staring at a screen, but the thrill of that first 'ding' of a sale? Pure magic! It was like a tiny validation that maybe, just maybe, I wasn't completely insane.

But man, there were so many moments I just wanted to throw in the towel. Shipping nightmares, demanding customers, and the constant fear of not making enough to cover my meager expenses gnawed at me. I'd stare at my inventory, feeling overwhelmed, wondering if this was just a childish fantasy. It felt like I was constantly juggling flaming torches while riding a unicycle, blindfolded.

After graduation, instead of jumping into a corporate gig like all my friends, I took a terrifying leap. I poured every penny of my savings into the business, rented a tiny studio, and expanded beyond just jewelry. It's been an absolute rollercoaster since then – monumental highs when a new collection sells out, and soul-crushing lows when things don't go as planned. Every day is a new challenge, a new lesson learned, and sometimes, a new reason to question my sanity.

Yet, seeing my creations bring a little spark of joy to someone, getting those heartwarming messages from happy customers – it's an indescribable feeling. The freedom, the challenge, the constant grind of building something from nothing… it’s hard, messy, beautiful work. It's not for the faint of heart, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.

So, what's *your* entrepreneurial journey been like? Any wild stories or tough lessons you've learned along the way? Drop 'em in the comments!",1,1768916815.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

So, after another night where I lost track of myself again and hurt loved ones for things I said and done under the influence of wine and vodka, I decided to stay sober for ar least 3 months.

I was drinking on average a bottle of white wine / day and unchecked amounts during weekends.

I had many wake up calls but this last one hit harder because of personal reasons.

So I did not drink from late July 2025 until late October 2025. 

I also decided to install Reframe, I am followed by a psychiatrist and I started doing intermittent fasting (only eat after 1pm except for water, coffee and supplements, but please check with your own doctor). Some walks and returning to golf might have helped too.

I lost 16kg / 35 pounds: https://files.fm/u/85fjyz8wzb

I restarted drinking since early November but felt things derailing again specially in late December/early January so I decided to commit again to a no-drinking period from 12 Jan to 12 June. Been doing ok although it gets a bit difficult on weekends, as I love to have dinner out and enjoy a good meal in a restaurant with my wife, friends and a good bottle of white wine and let the night flow.

When I feel these cravings I decided to take each time I breathe in and breathe out as an opportunity to analyse the cravings from an outside perspective - where do they come from, why am I feeling them, and so on. It makes them feel less daunting.

So I've been having symptoms of being a bitch for the longest time, complaining, being psychotic and overanalyzing everything etc. Friday night I took 20gs of good ol white powder. I felt alright at the time, specifically creatine prevented a post-food slump in mood I usually experience. Then next day I felt kinda depressed, shot 250 ius of HCG because I initially felt better on HCG and experimenting, felt kinda shit for the weekend and I experienced it as outright depressive thinking. Shit like leaving my job, my life was ruined by supplements and my father has been against me sabotaging my life. However on Monday I still felt all of this then drinking coffee made it calm down. This occurrence instilled a realization in me. Food and even coffee was affecting me disproportionately, creatine prevented that relationship. Life isn't supposed to change after coffee. There's something there.

Today I decided to take creatine again. Yesterday I felt nearly sick, weak and decreased leg strength. That could be an HCG slump (many days after a low dose) but creatine salvaged most of these symptoms today on it's own. It's as if my problems and anxiety were a dream. It makes me less compulsive and willing to face my own nonsense. That's about it.

Oh but it does sound suspiciously like an increase in DHT is causing these changes. This unshakable calmness could only be this god-blessed hormone. Oops, showed some DHT bias there, don't mind me.

So a couple years ago I met this girl at work, thought she was super cute, started talking to her about work stuff, proceeded to talk about outside of work stuff, she drove me home a couple times, we smoked a few joints together after work, and then after 2 or 3 months of talking I got her phone number by recommending her a TV show to watch.

fast forward a month after that, she comes and sleeps over, we cooked some food together and watched one of.her favorite movies together while eating and then went to bed cause she had to work the next day. she started sleeping over 3 or 4 times a week and eventually just fully moved in, we considered us as dating by this point of course and we were doing things together like hiking, going to some restaurants and what not as you would expect couples to do. we dated for nearly 2 years, loved together the entire time and she had told me a few different times how she could see me being ""the one"" and how she really looked forward to spending our lives together. she would pretty consistently talk about our future together and things we should work on around the house in the spring/summer/fall and seemingly had genuine love and care me for, and me for her as well.

winter 2024 came around, she hurt her arm at work and took time off, ended up quitting her job and staying inside all day everyday, falling asleep anywhere between 2am and maybe 6am and  ot waking up until anywhere from 12pm to as late as maybe 3pm-ish.

I had a retail job (with her) but I ended up getting let go pretty randomly, and had gotten another job within a week or so, so I was only unemployed for maybe 10 days maximum, never missed rent or anything 

then i was working construction and was honestly exhausted, falling asleep around 2am and waking up at 5am to leave the house between 5:30am and 6am. (I did not have a license or car at this point in time) and I would work and not get home anywhere from 4pm to sometimes as late as 7pm depending on the day/job.

she would tell me sometimes how she would get resentful that I didn't want to wash the dishes, clean the shower/bathroom or help with laundry. I do believe I should have helped more but I would fall asleep on the couch before even getting to eat dinner sometimes and I was just extremely tired until it got closer to a normal bedtime and then I struggle to fall asleep or just wake up a lot in general.

I heavily regret not helping her more even though she was home literally all day everyday for 4 months and not working. (I know how it looks)

I ended up getting so depressed from my job and probably just general stress that I didn't really do anything on valentines day at all, not even flowers, I just wanted to lay in bed, and she cried about that and I felt horrible. we went out for dinner a couple days later but I still just even now and very upset at myself for letting that happen. 

I started to not want to go out as much and sit on my computer and play games more despite still working while she stayed home. we would share cooking duty but it was generally on me when it came to preparation, which I enjoy, and I can also cook much better than her/was teaching her general cooking things and how to use a knife properly. 

March came around now and I had worked 14 hours 1 day and didn't fall asleep until 5am the next morning and I was very upset in bed/borderline crying to her about just how frustrated I was with working 12-14 hours and getting literally 1 hour of sleep and she suggested that I call in sick for the day. I got fired for that and was now unemployed \*again\* within 6 months.

after that we went and pet sat at her dad's house for like 12 days or so over March break while her dad and step mom went on vacation. she was a little bit distant, but still cuddled in bed mostly and would talk to me of course, it just felt like she was a little bit off/depressed as well but I trusted her to talk to me if she needed so I didn't bring it up with her. I spent the majority of my time at her dad's house job searching on my phone and just applying to pretty much anywhere I could get to easily without a car.

April rolls around and I get a job interview, nail the interview and get hired but i am told I am told I missed the orientation time by 1 day so I would have to wait 2 weeks.

2 weeks passes, it's near the end of April and I start at this new job, she seems happy with the pay I will receive and is talking about how she wants us to make a small garden in the backyard to grow vegetables in the summer now that I will get a discount on supplies from my job I just got.

after my first week, on the first weekend she goes to her friends and dyes her hair black, paints her nails a bright color and just acts a little bit different, Sunday rolls around and we go through a drive thru together to get breakfast and a coffee, she acts weird and then out of nowhere drops she was going to move out on Tuesday while I was at work and not tell me, then immediately starts packing all her stuff to leave, I'm not a dick so I help her pack despite being extremely upset at the suddenness of everything and then her mom shows up, helps her pack and they leave, me and her have a short goodbye talk hug/kiss and she leaves.

I get so depressed I lose \*that job too\*, I sit at home genuinely crying over this whole situation that came out of no where, etc.....

I tried to feel better over.the summer and couldn't, texted her in July and she mostly just brushed me off saying she didn't want to reconnect at all and was just generally uninterested in continuing to talk.

so if you managed to read this far, that's crazy

SO NOW, since July, I have gotten a job again, I have been saving money (something she complained about) I have gotten my license, and I have my own car now. I had a broken tooth that was kinda nasty and I got that removed as well (something she also complained about) and I have even gotten a cleaning at the dentist. I've been eating extremely healthy and cooking/meal prepping my entire week, I loft weights once or twice a week if I have a day off, because I'm working 5-6 days a week overnights and I've gotten back into martial arts, training BJJ 3 times a week.

and despite all that, I'm extremely anxious about losing her forever, I think about her literally daily, I struggle to sleep because of my intrusive thoughts about texting her again, making spotify playlist about still loving her and a gym playlist for how much I hurt still for her. i try and just do some things that make me happy and at every corner I am met with thoughts of;

""but what if she's already gotten another boyfriend?"" or if she's just with someone else in general. what if this, what if that.... what if I never see her again...

I've never in my life been this mentally fucked up over a girl and I just don't know what to do. I've completely turned my life around from what it was and she is still just stuck in my head constantly, daily, nightly... everything I do I get reminded of her in some way. I really do love her, I know that for sure. I just wish she would reach out so we could fix things. 

sorry for how long this is but both sides needed explaining so I did my best to include everything important as well as her complaints that male me look bad since I did make mistakes of course, but I thought she would be willing to work through things together instead of basically ghosting me IRL and moving out of my life without any kind of notice :/",1,1768916314.0,emotionalintelligence,0,1.0,False

Natural fibers are full of tiny pores and rough surfaces. Cotton and linen come from plants, so they’re basically bundles of microscopic tubes. Wool and silk are protein based, more like hair. When something spills, the stain doesn’t just sit on top. It gets pulled deep inside by moisture and heat.

Oily stains bond fast because natural fibers love oil. Protein stains like sweat, blood, or food can chemically attach to wool and silk. Tannins from coffee, tea, or wine latch onto plant fibers and darken as they oxidize. Once heat is added, those bonds tighten even more.

Detergent sometimes can’t break those bonds because it’s designed to lift dirt, not undo chemistry. That’s why old stains feel “set” no matter how much you wash them.

Synthetic fabrics are smoother and less absorbent, so stains stay closer to the surface. Natural fibers breathe better and feel nicer, but that same structure is why stains can become part of the fabric itself.",1,1768916216.0,BedroomBuild,0,1.0,False

1qi165o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marketing_China/comments/1qi165o/my_personal_guide_to_successfully_franchising_in/,My personal  guide to successfully franchising in China in 2026," From watching KFC and Starbucks explode to seeing homegrown monsters like Luckin Coffee eat everyone's lunch, I've seen what works, what flops, and what gets you sued or ghosted. It's January 2026, the market's still on fire (top chains hit \~CNY 500B+ sales last year, franchised stores up 33% YoY), but foreign brands? You gotta play dirty smart or get buried.

Franchising in China ain't like Europe or the US — it's a high-stakes poker game with IP thieves, cutthroat locals, insane scale, and regs that bite if you ignore them. But if you nail it, you print money: massive middle class, urbanization frenzy, and Chinese consumers worshipping ""authentic foreign"" vibes (as long as it's localized AF).

Here's the no-BS guide to **successfully franchising in China in 2026** — pulled from real wins (Starbucks pushing 9K+ stores, Subway's explosive rebound, McD's steady grind) and my own scars.

# 1. Master the ""2+1"" Rule & Get Your Legal House in Order (Non-Negotiable)

You can't just slap ""franchise"" on your brand and start signing deals.

* Operate **at least 2 company-owned stores** for **1+ year** anywhere in the world (doesn't have to be China — huge loophole for foreigners).
* Register as a franchisor with **MOFCOM** (Ministry of Commerce) — file your disclosure docs, ops manual, marketing plan, and prove maturity.
* Set up a local entity: Usually a **WFOE** (Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise) for full control, or JV if you're in restricted sectors. FTZs speed this up to 4-6 weeks.
* Trademark EVERYTHING early — China is first-to-file, and squatters are real. File in Chinese characters too. Pro tip: Hire a Shanghai/Beijing law firm specializing in franchising (IPO Pang Xingpu types) — cheap mistakes cost millions.

# 2. Pick the Right Franchisees — They're Your Make-or-Break (Hardest Part)

Chinese franchisees aren't passive investors — they're aggressive operators who'll push boundaries.

* They crave **famous Western brands** with prestige (Starbucks, McD's, KFC win here — perceived quality premium).
* Look for partners with deep pockets, real ops experience (food/service especially), and guanxi in Tier 1-3 cities.
* Avoid ""conceptual"" or unknown brands — Chinese want proven winners, not experiments.
* Vet ruthlessly: Check finances, talk to other franchisees, run background (they might flip your recipes day 1). Success stories: Dairy Queen grinded years finding solid partners; Subway switched to direct ops + strong local master franchisee and exploded stores post-2023.

# 3. Localize Hard or Die (Culture Eats Strategy)

""Foreign"" sells, but pure import flops.

* Adapt menu/pricing: KFC's congee + spicy twists; Starbucks' tea lattes; Subway's fresh rebound with local tastes.
* Go digital-first: WeChat Mini Programs, Douyin live streams, membership clubs (Yum China's 560M members drive 64% sales — insane repeat biz).
* Omnichannel beast: Physical stores + online ordering + community groups + flash sales.
* Lower-tier cities goldmine: Mixue (46K+ stores) proves cheap + scalable crushes in provinces.

# 4. Master Digital & ""Shoppertainment"" (2026 Must-Have)

Physical alone? You're toast.

* Ride **Douyin + Xiaohongshu** for virality — live commerce converts like crazy.
* Build private traffic: WeCom groups, mini-programs for loyalty, personalized coupons.
* Membership obsession: Starbucks/Luckin style — data = retargeting gold. Foreign winners: Nike/IKEA blend heritage with local twists; beauty/education brands kill with KOLs + communities.

# 5. Watch the Challenges — They Will F*ck You

* IP theft: Recipes, systems stolen — tight contracts + monitoring essential.
* Franchisee disputes: Hard to terminate bad ones — choose wisely.
* Reg changes: Rules evolve (2007 big update, still tightening consumer protection).
* Competition: Homegrown beasts (Luckin 22K+ stores, Zhengxin Chicken) undercut on price/speed.
* Economic wobbles: Consumption dips? Premium foreign holds better than mid-tier.

# Quick 2026 Franchise Success Blueprint

1. **Prep Phase**: Trademark, 2+1 proof, WFOE setup, MOFCOM filing.
2. **Partner Hunt**: Target experienced locals in growth cities (Tier 1 for prestige, 2-3 for volume).
3. **Launch Smart**: Start with 2-5 pilot stores (company-owned), prove model.
4. **Scale Digital**: Mini Program + Douyin live + WeChat ecosystem from day 1.
5. **Support Heavy**: Training, supply chain control, ongoing audits — don't let quality slip.
6. **Measure Ruthlessly**: Same-store sales, repeat rate, LTV > CAC, store profitability in year 1.

Bottom line, expat warriors: China franchising in 2026 rewards the adaptable, digitally savage, and paranoid-about-IP types. Go in thinking ""joint venture mindset"" even if WFOE — locals are your rocket fuel or your grave.

Crushing it right now? KFC/Yum (17K stores, membership monster), McDonald's (net 400+ opens H1 2025), Starbucks (heading to 9K), Subway's wild comeback. Homegrown eating the mid-market.

1qi13w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliceBodycam/comments/1qi13w1/are_you_searching_what_is_aim_of_life/,are you searching what is aim of life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qi12ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineHESIExam/comments/1qi12ib/passed_my_hesi_a2_w_a_96/,Passed my Hesi a2 w/ a 96!!,"96! 🥳 wanted to share some tips esp bc this group has been so helpful. I studied for about \~2 weeks primarily using nursehub subscription and quizlet. I will say tho that i alr semi studied for this exam over the summer but I didn’t end up taking it then.

Before Providing the detail overview, I would like to tell you that if you're struggling to pass HESI exam, you can get help from [Hiraedu](https://hiraedu.com) OR connect with an expert directly via WhatsApp: +12136359834

**A&p (100%)**\- I did the nursehub lessons and the 10 practice quizzes at the end. They were pretty similar to the exam and helpful for sure, but the quizlets were super helpful bc they had word for word questions from the exam. I will say I took a&p 1&2 a couple months ago so this information was mostly a refresh for me.

[https://quizlet.com/1065213298/hesi-a2-anatomy-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY](https://quizlet.com/1065213298/hesi-a2-anatomy-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY)

[https://quizlet.com/1062896229/hesi-a2-anatomy-physiology-v1v2-source-hectorboi-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY ](https://quizlet.com/1062896229/hesi-a2-anatomy-physiology-v1v2-source-hectorboi-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY)these were the best quizlets I found. Every single question on the first link was on my exam. And the 2nd link had a lot of them too. Thanks to these I recognized single question. Other helpful quizlets: [https://quizlet.com/902181887/hesi-a2-anatomy-physiology-2024-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY](https://quizlet.com/902181887/hesi-a2-anatomy-physiology-2024-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY)

There were no pictures and nothing about the specific parts of the bones like Nursehub did in the lessons (ex. Humerus, femur, ulna, etc)

**Biology (96%)**\- I just look bio this past semester so it was pretty fresh on my mind. I did the 10 practice tests in nursehub and also used quizlet. Again, nursehub was helpful for understanding concepts but I found a quizlet with word for word questions which was great.

[https://quizlet.com/1063737839/hesi-biology-2-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY](https://quizlet.com/1063737839/hesi-biology-2-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY)

There was a question about the healing vitamin, and pretty sure the answer was vitamin e NOT A (I got that one wrong). Know that strep throat is caused by bacteria, know hypertonic/hypotonic and water moving out/in the cell, there were 2 questions abt the microscope (one was stage and other was stage clips), nothing on photosynthesis,

**Chemistry (100%)**\- I also just took chem this past semester so it wasn’t too bad for me. Used nursehub 10 practice quizzes and quizlets, but I think the quizlets better prepared me personally.

There was 2 molar mass questions with elements Fe, Cu, O, S, N, (I think one was Cu(NO3)2? And Fe2(SO4)3 was 399.1 g/mol) so memorize those atomic masses from the periodic table. There was a question about Calcium chloride and sodium carbonate and what precipitate it makes (know how to turn the written formula into molecules and predict the products (CaCl2 + Na2CO3 -> CaCO3 + NaCl) answer was CaCO3. Know m1v1=m2v2 for one question that was like “1L of 3.60M h2so4 stack, find volume for 12M stack” (answer was 0.300L). Know acids change litmus paper blue to red, bases red to blue. And equal amounts of OH- and H+ need to be added to neutralize the base. Didn’t have any half life questions or anything about nuclear radioactivity.

[https://quizlet.com/user/kaiyamor/folders/hesi-chemistry?i=1d6xe0&x=1xqY ](https://quizlet.com/user/kaiyamor/folders/hesi-chemistry?i=1d6xe0&x=1xqY)this quizlet was really good and it over prepared me

**Math (96%)**\- a lot of fractions, proportions, and conversions (gallon man saved me), percentages, oz in a pint, converting from fractions to percentages to decimals, etc. nursehub 5 practice exams were really helpful

⁠A farmer has 240 acres at $188.99 per acre. If he cultivates 60 bushels per acre, with $5.67 per bushel, how much revenue will he generate? Answer was $36,290.40 I think.

I didn’t get any Roman numerals but I had like 3 military time questions

[https://quizlet.com/410713476/hesi-a2-math-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY ](https://quizlet.com/410713476/hesi-a2-math-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY)I didn’t use this to study but after taking the exam, this has a couple of the questions I saw so I would recommend understanding how to solve these problems.

**Grammar (98%)**\- only did the nursehub lessons and the practice tests at the end. I would say it was pretty helpful. Just make sure you read the questions carefully. Know lie/lay, who/whom, it’s/its, bad/badly, good/well, continuously/continually etc. There was a question about mail formatting so know that (Mr. John Ryan, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, DC 20003). Didn’t get anything on predicate nominative/adjective or direct/indirect objects

[https://quizlet.com/1065560209/hesi-grammar-pt-2-hesi-grammar-lie-vs-lay-hesi-a2-grammar-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY ](https://quizlet.com/1065560209/hesi-grammar-pt-2-hesi-grammar-lie-vs-lay-hesi-a2-grammar-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY). I also didn’t use this but after taking the exam this seems helpful and has some questions straight from the test

**Vocab (96%)**\- I only used nursehubs practice tests and I definitely should have branched out. Had to make a few of educated guesses bc I didn’t know any of the words in the answer choices (guessing game strong tho 😛😛) words like efface, avid, credulous, cast, plaudit, lampoon (I literally thought this was a made up word bro). Use multiple resources for this section!!

[https://quizlet.com/1065562184/hesi-vocab-2-hesi-a2-vocab-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY ](https://quizlet.com/1065562184/hesi-vocab-2-hesi-a2-vocab-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY)Like I said, I only used nursehub for this section but this quizlet looks really helpful.

**Reading (88%)**\- my lowest score 🥲 I used nursehub practice quizzes and quizlet. Passages I had: the water cycle, Golden Gate Bridge, voices, coffee, circus, exams, food, game of bridge, getting a good nights sleep, one dollar bill, phobias, factories, Amazon rainforest, healthcare. For this section ESPECIALLY be mindful abt quizlets/studuco bc I found many of them to have incorrect answers. I was just second guessing a lot of my answers and I think reading the passages beforehand on quizlet messed my head up. I would say nursehub is a good tool, but make sure you evaluate your weaknesses (ex. Finding the main idea, making conclusions) and utilize nursehub/other study resources to work on that. Also don’t assume: use the information they give you to get to your answer.

[https://quizlet.com/1059929699/reading-hesi-a2-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY ](https://quizlet.com/1059929699/reading-hesi-a2-flash-cards/?i=1d6xe0&x=1jqY)used this quizlet but like I said, be mindful of the answers

As for actually taking the exam, you get 4 hours total and you can choose the order you take the sections. You can take breaks but your time keeps running. And you can’t go back once you’ve answered a question. I took my harder sections first (personally- was reading, grammar, vocab), then the easier stuff (math, a&p, chem, bio) bc I didn’t want my brain to be fried then still have to use a bunch of brain power yk? It took me 3 and 1/2 hours but I also am a slower test taker. It does tell you your score as you finish each section which was alittle nerve racking but 🤷‍♀️

**My takeaways**\- quizlets were really helpful for knowing exactly what type of questions I was going to see but PLEASE BE MINDFUL a lot of them have mistakes including (some) of the ones I put links for. For something more objective like the science subjects it was pretty easy to notice those mistakes/search them up, but I found it harder to know if the subjective reading quizlets contained any mistakes but just be aware. Don’t trust every quizlet you see with all your heart. NURSEHUB was great, even tho the quizlets helped with knowing the questions, I still think I would have done great without them bc nursehub’s practice exams AND the rationales explaining each question (⭐️⭐️⭐️) were super helpful for understanding concepts.

I probably skipped a lot of stupid mistakes I would’ve made if I started younger (yes, I know failure = learning, but *financials are also a thing*).

Over the past year, I’ve been paying more attention to my dressing sense. While attending a wedding in December, I decided it was finally time to find a **signature scent** \- conveniently overlooking the fact that I was doing this **at the last moment**. I ended up buying the Ajmal discovery set and that started a cascade of purchases that is now 15 decants, 4 custom clones and 6 bottles big (with the help of a friend).

Anyway, here are my very amateur impressions after about a month in the hobby:

**Ajmal Kuro**

This is a strong scent for my liking, not bad in any way but it just wasn't my taste.

**Ajmal Shiro**

This is my favorite among the Ajmal perfumes that I have, it has a great top note and the dry down is simply beautiful.

**Ajmal Blu**

Feels like a toned-down version of Shiro. Much milder and more subtle but it works well for situations where I have to sit in an enclosed space. All Ajmal perfumes have good performance and projections.

**Lattafa Asad Elixir**

Probably my **favorite overall**. Smells like vanilla coffee, projects for hours, and the base notes are just *chef’s kiss*.

**Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa**

Honestly feels like Asad Elixir **without the top notes**. Good scent, but feels a bit redundant in my collection because of Asad Elixir.

**Rasasi Hawas Ice**

Among the entire collection I have right now, I like Hawas Ice the least because it feels very similar to the commercial deos that we get in the market. It is not BAD by any means, but I like the others better for their scent profile. Insane projection and performance though.

**YSL Libre**

(based on the internet it is a women's scent, but I got a decant from a friend while he was trying to declutter)  
I really liked this one, the top notes were a little too spicy for me, but after about an hour it had a sort of woody scent that was phenomenal. Possibly my favorite or second favorite dry down smell.

Well. I have some news for them.

They did, in fact, correctly name my town and state, so there’s no confusion about the location—but—and this is a very large but—there are not three banks in this village.

There are zero. Nada. Zip. Nil.

What we do have is a small post office, a fire department consisting of one large garage bay, a handful of modest businesses, a few shops, and some very good places to eat. We have people who know your dog’s name, wave even when they’ve just seen you ten minutes earlier, and will happily debate the weather as if it were a matter of national importance.

If you really want a loan, your best bet is to drive to a larger town, where you can surely find a branch of your own banking institution. They also have a coffee bar—often with snacks—and sometimes a basket of lollipops at the teller’s window. What you won’t find is their advertisements popping up online while you’re reading random articles about something entirely unrelated.

But three banks? Not unless they’re operating out of a shanty… or some other unlikely location.

1qi0w58,https://i.redd.it/t337tdqz8ieg1.jpeg,If Crash Landing on You were your project: what would you add to deepen the story?,"TL;DR: Rookie rewatcher and a Huge fan. Curious what small additions others would make to deepen what’s already there.

Because I'm late to the party (first watch Dec 28 '25, on my 3d rewatch now) I’m joining these discussions long after they first happened. So please, bear with me.

Just out of curiosity: if you looked at the series from a creator’s perspective, what would you add to deepen what’s already there?

My own thoughts:

• More physical closeness and subtle intimacy, without becoming too Western.

For example, a kiss on the bridge in South Korea during their date, or during the drunk conversation where Jeong-hyeok talks about his future. They’re sitting apart, both emotional. Him simply putting an arm around her would have completed the moment.

• A deeper answer in the car scene about “type.”

When Jeong-hyeok asks Se-ri what she truly likes, it comes after he has spoken to her colleagues and realizes that the image others have of her doesn’t match the woman he knows. By that point, we’ve already seen her growth. Her answer, “You’re my type,” feels out of sync with that growth. I would have added one line that better reflects what the story already shows.

• Acknowledgment for Jeong-hyeok in the hospital (South Korea).

During Se-ri’s hospital stay, Jeong-hyeok is always there. People see him. Family members and colleagues walk past him. Her mother even has coffee with him, but that conversation stays superficial. Her father never asks who he is or why he’s there. After Se-ri is admitted again and her life is at risk, no one seems to ask the obvious question. I missed a moment where someone simply addresses him directly.

• Closure involving Jeong-hyeok’s comrades.

They were essential to the story, yet we never really see what happens after. A moment showing he’s still in contact with them would have added closure.

• A slightly less ambiguous final episode.

The Switzerland ending suggests “two weeks a year,” but the house feels lived in and permanent. One small confirmation of continuity would have grounded the ending more.

Lately I’ve been brewing with the **V2**, and I’ve noticed how different the profile feels compared to a V60 or Origami.

Because of the flat bottom and hole design, I feel the V2 highlights fruity coffees more and gives a slightly heavier body, while V60 and Origami tend to deliver more clarity and lighter mouthfeel. Of course, origin, grind size, water, roast level, and personal preference all play a role, but this difference has been pretty consistent for me.

So I wanted to ask:

👉 What types of coffees do you usually recommend the V2 for?  
👉 Do you prefer it for fruity profiles, sweeter cups, more structured brews, or specific origins/processes?

For me, no sugar includes fruit, starches, and less than 25g TOTAL carbs per day, though I usually stick to 0-10 with my usual day to day eating which is high fat, moderate protein carnivore / ketovore. 

  
I do have another goal which is 10 days or under of eating sugar or having a high carb day throughout the entire year of 2026. 



The longest I went without sugar before was 57 day. Before starting this challenge I’d usually have it once a week - on Sundays - eithun a one hour eating window so I wasn’t spiking my blood sugar continuously. (Usually a pint of ice cream) 

  
I know this is a sugarfree sub but it its alright, I’ll touch on the no dairy aspect. Before this challenge I had heavy cream in my coffee and cheese a few times a week. That’s it. No milk, yogurt, kefir etc as those all made my crave sugar anyways. I was originally trying no dairy for the month of December as the flu was going around, but then my husband started fighting off a sickness and decided he’d do no dairy for January. I decided I might as well extend it and go for 60 day. I have now been having massive improvement with body recomposition so I upped it to 100 days.  I have lost a couple lbs but more importantly, I am losing inches. My eyes are bigger and brighter and I have a glow to me I didn’t have before.

I’m a 28 year old male 210 lbs; I was 225lbs when this all started last June. I was getting in my car one morning and bumped my head on the back corner; felt a bit strange after but dint think much of it. I had a moment later that day where my body froze up in public, and I felt uneasy about to drop; I moved quickly and snapped out of it. From that day on, I’ve been feeling constantly light headed and uneasy with balance issues; I haven’t fainted or fallen over ever however. I get these frozen feelings sometimes and more uneasy when I’m in public, and when I consume STARBUCKS coffee; strange right? I have this not in my neck as well, I think it’s called occipital neuralgia if I’m not mistaken, and it’s a knot right at the base of my skull on the right side. 

I’ve done a head CT without and with contrast, chest Xray, MRI of head, vestibular testing, sleep study, and extensive blood work; also a neck ultrasound. I’m awaiting a neurologist appointment, but the waiting time is long here in Toronto. I’m also seeing an endocrinologist around that time as well.

The ENT told me I had possible BPPV in both canals in the right side; I explained to her that the room isn’t spinning it’s just a balance and light headed issue. She said how she’s just and ENT a that beyond her scope of practice; dismissed me when I asked about a neck MRI. They can order them faster for you apparently. Now I’m stuck waiting for the neurology appointment. 

From the other tests, I’ve discovered I had I had severe asleep apnea, and Low-Normal AM cortisol (239nmol/L). My HbA1C was also 6.0. The sleep apnea had apparently caused mild atrophy in my brain for my age. 

My questions are:

1) has anyone dealt with this issue and what do it turn out to be?

2) does this sound like PPPD or anything similar? 

3) if you were me, how would you handle it and what would you do, or suggest?

1qi0of9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qi0of9/am_i_overreacting_to_my_girlfriends_instagram/,Am I Overreacting to my girlfriend's instagram habits?,"My girlfriend (31f) has an instagram account with circa 20,000 followers. She posts primarily gym related content, you can probably picture what I mean, plenty of people do it now. 

She's had it for ages. Since we've started dating (circa 6 months) she's actually posted way less. Curiously, she does post whenever we have a mild disagreement, or on days where she's feeling run down/bad/hormonal. 

This triggers something in me related to deception. Hearing her say (via text or in person) that she feels awful, feels ugly, feels fat, whatever - and then seeing her very audience-friendly body-forward posts just creates a weird visceral reaction within me. I tell myself that it's not deceit, it's just curation, but something inside me is screaming about being lied to in these moments, or at least finding it unsettling that she's seemingly seeking external interaction at a time where she's feeling her lowest (I guess writing it out, the external boost makes sense, but perhaps I'm irked that I'm not providing this for her? I'm not too sure).

When we're together she never ever posts anything. But when we're apart, she'll post the most mundane of updates (out for coffee with a friend for instance) if she's feeling a little down. Sometimes, these updates reach her audience before they reach me, and I learn about what she's up to with the 20,000 others. Sometimes the moments from when we have been together are posted with me cropped out (fair enough, I'm not expecting a hard launch or whatever), but typically at a time where we've hit a speed bump usually with a caption like ""I've been keeping to myself but here's a January update"" or something. 

I haven't raised it with her, because I fear that she'll shut it down in favour of me, and the last thing I want is for her to mute a part of herself that she gets enjoyment from just because the guy she is dating is uncomfortable. I'm trying to work out though if this is a fundamental misalignment (I'm quite a private person, even more so when I'm dating, and I typically rightly or wrongly go out of my way to not engage in pursuits that might signal availability/attention when I'm dating), or just something I need to work on/get over? 

It really isn't a nice feeling but she's otherwise brilliant so I wouldn't want to walk away from it unless it really was something fundamental. ",0,1768914573.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.5,False
1qi0o0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qi0o0p/sciencebacked_habits_that_actually_rebuild_your/,Science-Backed Habits That ACTUALLY Rebuild Your Life (no BS from Reddit echo chambers),"Look, I've spent way too much time studying human behavior, reading self improvement books, listening to psychology podcasts, and honestly? Most advice out there is recycled garbage. Everyone's screaming ""wake up at 5am"" and ""cold showers"" like that's gonna fix your entire existence.

Here's what actually works. This isn't theory, this is synthesized from actual research, behavioral science, and sources that aren't just regurgitating the same tired BS. I've pulled this from books like Atomic Habits, podcast deep dives with neuroscientists, and studies on habit formation that actually hold up under scrutiny.

The real issue isn't that you're lazy or broken. Your brain is literally wired to resist change because it's metabolically expensive. Society sells you quick fixes, but lasting transformation requires understanding how your neural pathways actually work. The good news? You can rewire them, and here's how.

**Stop trying to change everything at once**

Your prefrontal cortex has limited bandwidth. When you try to overhaul your entire life simultaneously, you drain your willpower reserves and crash hard. James Clear's research in Atomic Habits shows habit stacking works because you're piggybacking new behaviors onto existing neural pathways. Start absurdly small. Want to read more? Put a book on your pillow. Want to exercise? Just put on workout clothes. The activation energy for starting is your real enemy, not the task itself.

**Track your time like you're conducting an experiment on yourself**

Most people have zero clue where their time actually goes. For one week, use an app like Toggl or RescueTime to track everything. No judgment, just data collection. You'll probably discover you're spending 4 hours daily on mindless scrolling while claiming you ""don't have time"" for your goals. The awareness alone will make you uncomfortable enough to change. Dr. Cal Newport talks about this in Deep Work, he found that people drastically overestimate their productive hours and underestimate their distraction time.

**Build a ""second brain"" for your thoughts**

Your working memory can only hold about 7 items at once. Trying to keep everything in your head creates massive cognitive load and anxiety. Use Notion, Obsidian, or even just a basic notes app to externalize your thinking. Tiago Forte's book Building a Second Brain is genuinely one of the best productivity resources I've encountered. It's not about being organized for the sake of it, it's about freeing up mental RAM so you can actually think clearly. Create a system where ideas, tasks, and knowledge are stored outside your brain so you're not constantly trying to remember everything.

**Practice ""implementation intentions"" instead of vague goals**

Saying ""I want to be healthier"" does literally nothing. Your brain needs specific cues. Research from psychologist Peter Gollwitzer shows that people who use ""if then"" planning are 2 to 3 times more likely to follow through. Instead of ""I'll exercise more,"" say ""If it's Monday/Wednesday/Friday at 7am, then I will do a 20 minute workout in my living room."" The specificity creates a mental trigger that bypasses decision fatigue. You're not relying on motivation, you're creating automatic behavioral responses.

**Do a weekly ""life audit"" every Sunday**

Dedicate 30 minutes each week to review what worked, what didn't, and what needs adjusting. Use the Finch app for this, it's surprisingly good for habit tracking and mental health check ins.

BeFreed is another option worth checking out. It's an AI learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on your goals. Founded by Columbia grads and former Google engineers, it pulls from high quality sources to create structured learning that actually fits your life. You control the depth, from quick 10 minute summaries to 40 minute deep dives with examples. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with about your struggles, and it'll recommend content that matches where you're at. Helpful for turning that Sunday reflection into actual targeted growth instead of just spinning your wheels.

Ask yourself during these audits: What drained my energy? What gave me energy? What am I avoiding? This meta awareness prevents you from sleepwalking through months of your life. The Huberman Lab podcast has an entire episode on this, Andrew Huberman emphasizes that self directed neuroplasticity requires conscious review and adjustment of behaviors.

**Eliminate before you optimize**

Everyone wants to add new habits but nobody wants to quit their destructive ones. Tim Ferriss talks about this constantly, subtraction is often more powerful than addition. What's the ONE thing you're doing that's actively making your life worse? Doomscrolling? Staying in a toxic relationship? Working a job that's crushing your soul? Cut that out first. You can't build a healthy life on a foundation of things that are actively destroying you. Be ruthless about elimination.

**Create ""friction"" for bad habits and remove it for good ones**

Behavioral design is everything. Want to stop checking your phone constantly? Put it in another room. Want to read more? Keep books everywhere, on your nightstand, in your bathroom, in your bag. BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits research shows that behavior happens when motivation, ability, and a prompt converge. Make destructive behaviors harder to access and constructive ones easier. It sounds stupidly simple but it works because you're designing your environment to support the person you want to become.

**Practice ""strategic incompetence"" with things that don't matter**

Stop trying to be excellent at everything. You have finite energy. Decide what actually matters for your life rebuilding goals and let everything else be mediocre. Can't cook gourmet meals? Fine, eat simple food. Don't care about having an immaculate house? Let it be messy. Greg McKeown's book Essentialism hammered this home for me, the disciplined pursuit of less but better. Society pressures you to be good at everything, but that's a recipe for burnout and achieving nothing meaningful.

**Build in ""temptation bundling""**

Pair activities you need to do with things you actually enjoy. Economist Katy Milkman researched this and found people who only let themselves watch Netflix while exercising were 51% more likely to maintain their workout habit. Only listen to your favorite podcast during meal prep. Only get your fancy coffee while doing your morning planning. You're hacking your reward system to associate necessary tasks with pleasure.

**Schedule ""worry time"" and protect ""deep work time""**

Anxiety thrives when it has unlimited access to your consciousness. Set aside 15 minutes daily to write down everything you're worried about, then contain it to that window. Sounds weird but it actually works, your brain learns that worrying is for specific times, not all the time. Then, create non negotiable blocks for focused work. Use apps like Freedom or Forest to block distractions. The dichotomy between these two practices creates mental clarity. You're not suppressing anxiety, you're giving it a container so it doesn't contaminate everything else.

The pattern here? Small, specific, evidence backed changes that compound over time. Your life won't transform in 30 days or even 90. But in 6 months? A year? You'll barely recognize yourself. The key is consistency, not intensity. Most people fail because they try to sprint a marathon. Don't do that.

Start with ONE habit from this list. Master it. Then add another. That's it. No heroic transformations, no dramatic overhauls, just intelligent, sustainable behavior change that actually sticks.",3,1768914541.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

Tgen after an hour she sees something at her phone & says ""I think we should go, I have to catch the bus for home"". I believe thta was bullshit, something happened & she got shook up & wanted to leave. So, we got up, & she just said bye, no hugs no nothing, & straight up ran to the bus stop. Is ent her a message later that night that ""I had fun"" & she answered ""it was good for me too"". After a few days, I sent her a message lik hi whats going on & she told me that she has lots of studying which was utter crap. So I wondered If I did something wrong & I dont think I did. Anyway, I moved on for that time.

Today, 3 months later she popped on my mind & I have the stupidest idea to send her a text like hi, how you doing, to see whats gonna happen. I know I wont get answers for last time. Hell, I dont think she'll respond at all, she'll peobably be with someone else right now. My sister tells me not to send her anything, but I'm rather stupid & I dont want to listen to her advice.

When she arrived, we told her we were looking forward to her staying, and asked that she keep noise to a minimum and clean up after herself.  Normal sort of stuff.  She has been sleeping on a foldout couch in the lounge as my husband and I each use a spare bedroom as home offices.

Last night, just before 9, the intercom at our gate buzzed.  I commented to my husband that it was a bit late for visitors; turned out, my sister in law invited a friend of hers (along with this friend's three kids) to our house without asking (and late at night too).

This didn't sit right with me.  We're normally in bed by 9/9:30.  Knowing strangers were in our house made me feel really uncomfortable.  I was too stunned to say anything.

This morning I awoke to a messy kitchen, no milk, no coffee capsules, and pizza boxes left on the coffee table.  I work from home and had a meeting first thing but wasn't feeling my best without my first coffee of the day.  A few minutes into my meeting, I could hear raised voices.

Advice from a very mid student with very mid scores.,"I promised myself I'd write this post if I passed because it was posts like this that got me through. Sat on December 23rd, got the P on Jan 14th.

For context, I am a US IMG in Ireland. My med school only gave us about 6 weeks of true dedicated time and my NBMEs were in the 40s at the start so I begrudgingly deferred (but no regrets about it, I was not ready under any circumstances). Anyway, here is what I did:

Before deferring:

* Lots of bootcamp: decent resource but extremely detailed and time consuming. Do not recommend for dedicated, but good for the lead-up to it if you're an IMG.
* UWorld: did about 40% of it, and my average was 39%.
* Form 26 — 42% 
* Form 27 — 49%

After this, I realised I had a big knowledge gap and too little time. I took a few months to go back to the drawing board and study more. I also began MS3 and rotations actually helped consolidate some knowldge from preclinical (you don't forget diseases as easily once you've seen them in person). Picked back up a couple months later, and had 5 more weeks of dedicated.

* UWorld: I had now completed 75% of the bank and my average was around 50%.
* Form 28 — 62% (20 days out), booked exam.
* Form 29 — 62% (17 days out)
* Form 31 — 64% (10 days out)
* Form 32 — 66% (8 days out, 93% chance of passing). Felt really good at this point, but stared feeling really tired.
* Form 33 — 60% (this was 5 days out, sent me into a massive spiral. I realised I was so burnt out). Calmed down, went through it in detail and realized I made 30+ silly mistakes so I don’t think it accurately reflected what I could do). 
* New Free 120: 64% (3 days out and again, felt super burnt out, made stupid mistakes, furthered the spiral). 

The 3 days before my exam, I went over my free 120 and my NBME incorrects (which I had compiled into an Anki deck), but most importantly, **I RESTED**. I knew I could do it, I had the knowledge and the stamina but I was extremely burnt out. So I rested, went to the gym, ate healthy, met up with a friend for coffee, despite the insane anxiety. I did not feel ready the day before at all, but I tried really hard to trust the HUNDREDS of hours I put in. I tried to hype myself up right before and throughout my exam, and I just tried my best.

Following the exam, I felt numb. I was convinced I failed. I could hardly remember the exam content, but I remembered about 10 questions I got wrong and genuinely believed I had failed. Months and months of stress accumulated into the worst migraine of my life, and 14 hours of sleep. I didn't want to talk about my exam at all.

I was so shocked when I passed that I started crying.

The entire process sucks the life out of you, it's a stupid hurdle we have to get over. *I also cannot stress this enough:* **Step 1 is not about knowing everything, it's about understanding how they ask questions.** More than half my correct answers on NBMEs (and on the exam) were **educated guesses**, because I could easily recognise the curve balls/wrong answers. Anyway, I just hope this posts reassures other people like me. I'm a very average student, my med school GPA is literally smack-bang the class average. Here's how I studied:

* **Anki**: not a fan. Way too time consuming. That being said, I did end up making a deck of my personal weaknesses and NBME incorrects. It had about 1800 cards in it, so once I went through the whole thing I was only doing 45 minutes or so of Anki a day which was fine for me. Only really did this the month leading up to my exam.
* **UWorld**: 10/10, a must. I read a study that showed that there was a massive discrepancy in pass rates between people who did <50% of the Q bank versus 75% or more of it, so I did 75%. I saw a massive difference in my NBME scores (jumped from 49% to 62%). This also trains your brain to ""think in USMLE"". The exam truly is pattern recognition.
* **Pathoma/Sketchy Micro:** used both early one. Loved these resources but did not complete either.
* **Bootcamp/AMBOSS:** both are *okay* for developing your knowledge base but they are not necessary.
* **First aid:** not great to start off with, but super helpful once you're in dedicated.
* **Mehlman**: did the arrows doc and that was it. I do really like his stuff, and do recommend it if you're a few months out. But I had my moral qualms with him which held me back from using his stuff.

I also wanted to include of **things I DID NOT STUDY**. This is because what overwhelmed me most was the sheer amount of content I thought I had to cover, when in reality, you don't.

* **Pharm**: there are about 15 high yield drugs and their MOAs that always come up (think metro, cipro, immunosuppressants, TB drugs, HIV drugs, etc...). It's such a complex topic, but such a waste of time to study in detail. Learn the high yield stuff only.
* **Repro**: yeah I just didnt have time for this lol. Only knew stuff from NBMEs (placenta accreta, varicocele due to left gonadal vein obstruction, etc...)
* **Biostats**: watched a couple randy Neil videos and that's all I needed. Had one single stat question come up, and it's not worth spending weeks learning math. Just memorise standard deviation %, PPV, NPV, Sensitivity, specificity, RR, OR, etc...).
* **Biochem**: hate it. Never bothered learning the pathways other than easy ones (like alcohol metabolism). Learned the pathology only (I cell disease, Hunter, Hurler, Glycogen storage disease, PKU, MSUD, MCAD def, etc...). Don't bother learning the pathways, but just recognise them. *The one topic I do recommend going over is vitamins (deficiencies, toxicities, and what they do)*. This does come up a good bit.

I had friends that skipped entire systems (like cardio, or renal) because they knew from UW that they only ask very specific questions on most systems. It's a personal decision, but you truly do NOT need to cover everything to pass this exam. You mostly just need to trust yourself.

Anyway, if you guys have any questions, please ask away.

Hi everyone,

I have a Fiorenzato All Ground Sense for about 2 months now, and honestly, I’m not really happy with it. Hoping to get some opinions and tips here.
	1.	Dosing / Scale Unit
I calibrated the scale unit using the same weight as my Acaia Lunar. In theory, my grind dose is about 18 g when I set the grinder to 18.1 g. However, the actual dose still fluctuates between 17.8 g and 18.2 g, which feels a bit imprecise.
	2.	Espresso dialing
Dialing in espresso is quite tricky. I’m currently trying to dial in a mid-roast coffee.

	•	Current setting: 33 seconds
	•	One click coarser → extraction ends in about 23 seconds

This means the grinder’s adjustments are very coarse, making it hard to fine-tune the espresso exactly.

My questions for you:
	•	Has anyone else experienced similar issues with the All Ground Sense?
	•	Any tips for stabilizing dosing?
	•	How do you approach dialing in mid-roast coffees?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

1qi0c95,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1qi0c95/hcmc_six_day_travel_plan/,HCMC Six Day Travel Plan,"I recently visited HCMC for six days with a group of friends (25 to 30 years old). I thought I would share my experience as to what we got up to over the six days as it may be of use to someone else when they are planning their trip.

**Pre Travel Considerations:**

It's recommended that you have some vaccines / booster shots before travelling. Here in the UK, our healthcare system provides the following for free:

· Hepatitis A

· Diphtheria, Tetanus and Polio (3 in 1)

· Typhoid

It’s recommended that you take probiotics around a week before you travel and whilst you're out in Vietnam. I used Optibac travel probiotics which apparently reduce your risk of getting traveller’s diarrhoea by about 15%.

I'm from the UK so it's not a requirement for us to complete any visas however definitely check if you're from another country.

If you are travelling to Vietnam during hot season (February, March April), it's recommended to take some electrolytes to help with dehydration and to replenish some of the salts your body loses through sweating.

Avoid tap water at all costs as well as unfiltered ice made from tap water. I'm over cautious so avoided raw food like sushi and raw salad (especially unwashed or washed with tap water). 

If you plan on using your mobile phone out in Vietnam, I would recommend getting an E-sim. I used Holafly as it was only £20 for the week for unlimited data.

Bring mosquito spray with a high percentage of DEET (especially if you plan on venturing outside of the city).

**Day One:**

We landed early in the morning and caught up on a few hours sleep at the hotel to help us adjust to the time zone difference. We stayed at the La Siesta Hotel in D1 which was obsoletely amazing. We had a leisurely day checking out our local surroundings, spending time around the pool, having an early dinner and a couple of drinks at our rooftop bar. Went to bed early which was a good call as we woke up fully refreshed and completely adjusted to the time zone difference.

**Day Two:**

Explore the city. Visit the Ben Thanh & Saigon Square Markets. Ben Thanh is a little bit manic with lots going on all around you. Saigon Square is much calmer and is air conditioned. Saigon also has lots of shops, shopping centres and stalls all around D1. Visit the Cafe Apartments for a coffee. It was a little bit over priced compared to other coffee shops around D1 but the vibe nice in there. If you're looking for tailored clothes such as a suit, then there are many places to have one made up. We went to Nhut Tailors, good service but bare in mind that it takes a number of days to produce the suit therefore it's definitely worth getting one made up on your first day. Our day two was a Saturday so we visited the crazy Bui Vien Walking Street. Yes, it's very touristy, tacky and if you're going to be overcharged for a beer, it's going to happen here. Despite all of that, it is worth walking down the street just to see how crazy it is!

**Day Three:**

We booked a river cruise down the Saigon River through 'Saigon Boat Company'. Relatively cheap (£12), bar and toilet onboard. Tour was an hour and was great. They pointed out all the main landmarks down the length of the river. We then visited the Skyview Observatory at Landmark 81 which is the 17th tallest building in the world. Good view of the city, VR experience + photo included. Lots of spare time during the day to explore.

**Day Four:**

We had a full on tourist day on our fourth day. We spent the day visiting the main tourist attractions within the city. In the morning, we visited the Independent Palace (VND80,000 / £2) which was the South Vietnamese governmental building during the war. It’s still decked out in 1970s furniture and has war rooms in the basement. Next door is the Notre Dame Cathedral (miniature copy of the one in Paris) and Post Office which are just two buildings you should go and see. In the afternoon we visited the War Remnants Museum (VND40,000  /£1) which is probably the best museum I’ve ever been too.

**Day Five:**

Probably the best day of the trip, we booked a private tour through 'Saigon Adventure' and visited the Chi Chu Tunnels. The benefit of a private tour is that you can choose when to depart so we missed a lot of the busy morning traffic and the waves of tours that show up early in the morning. We got to the tunnels as all the large tour groups were leaving. The drive was about an hour and a half north of Saigon. Such an amazing tour, we got to see traps used during the war, underground tunnels and learnt a lot about how the soldiers in the countryside.

**Day Six:**

We left day six as a free day without any structure as everyone wanted to do different things. We did a mix of things like spend the last of our VND in the markets and shops buying presents and gifts for people at home, enjoyed a massage at the spa, played golf, sat around the swimming pool and generally relaxed in the sun. Our flight was early the next morning so had an early night.

We had such an incredible time in HCMC and were glad we didn't completely overpack our Itinerary as part of joys of travelling is stumbling upon places which you can't plan for. There were other sights we could have gone to visit however we were happy with the well rounded trip we experienced.",2,1768913673.0,VietNam,0,1.0,False

Ever feel like retirement is some mythical creature—like a unicorn or a well-behaved toddler? You *know* it exists, but actually *seeing* it feels impossible. Here’s the kicker: **You might already have more than you think.**

Most of us underestimate how far our savings can go. A few tweaks, a little strategy, and suddenly, that nest egg isn’t just a pile of numbers—it’s a *ticket* to freedom. Let’s break it down.

### **3 Ways Your Savings Are Secretly Supercharged**
1. **Compound Interest: The Silent Hustler**
   - Think of it like a snowball rolling downhill—except instead of snow, it’s *money*, and instead of a hill, it’s *time*.
   - Example: $10,000 at 7% interest for 30 years? That’s **$76,123**—without lifting a finger. *Magic.*

2. **Tax Advantages: The Government’s “Oops, Here’s Free Money”**
   - 401(k)s, IRAs, HSAs—these aren’t just alphabet soup. They’re **tax shelters** that let your money grow *faster* because Uncle Sam isn’t nibbling at it.
   - Pro tip: Max out employer matches. It’s literally *free cash*.

3. **Lifestyle Leverage: Spend Smarter, Retire Sooner**
   - Cutting a $5 daily coffee habit = **$1,825/year**. Invest that? **$180K+** in 30 years.
   - Retirement isn’t about deprivation—it’s about *redirecting* spending to what *actually* matters.

### **The Mindset Shift**
Here’s the truth: **Retirement isn’t about having *enough*—it’s about knowing what *enough* looks like.**
- Do you need a mansion? Or just a cozy spot with good Wi-Fi?
- Do you need a Lamborghini? Or just *not* stressing over car payments?

*You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.* **[Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb)** *(Affiliate link—because even retirement planners need coffee money.)*

### **The Bottom Line**
Your future self is out there, sipping a drink on a beach (or a mountain, or a hammock in the backyard). The question is: **What’s one small move you can make today to get them closer?**

Maybe it’s upping your 401(k) by 1%. Maybe it’s brewing coffee at home. Maybe it’s just *believing* that unicorn is real.

There are parts of the official version of the season that I really like, so I’m keeping those as part of my story. Any feedback or thoughts are welcome. If you want me to keep going, please let me know!

**Part 2:**

The sun shines light into the Wheeler household. A young Holly looks out of the window at the blue sky. Every morning is a victory.

“Holly!” Karen calls from the dining room. “Could you rouse the troops?” Holly darts through the house, screaming at the top of her voice; “BREAKFAST!” to all corners.

Mike, Will and Lucas all rise from their beds, floor cots and camp beds in Mikes room. Erika stirs in Holly’s room. Nancy and Jonathan grumble awake in Nancy’s pink paradise. In the basement Mr and Mrs Sinclair finish getting dressed and make their way up the stairs.

The boys dress as they discuss the events of the night before; the dead Demagorgon, how close to Mike it got. What’s wrong with Dustin…

It’s chaos in the dining room as the three families move around each other; grabbing food, exchanging news, discussing disappearances, eruptions etc.

“We’re getting less and less space in Hawkins every day…” Ted moans dryly. He’s not talking about the town.

“Ted…” Karen warns; giving him that look.

“I’m just saying…” Ted adds, lifting the now empty coffee pot

“Don’t worry,” Mr Sinclair assures them. “You’ll have four less mouths to feed soon,”

“Thank you for letting us stay these past few months, I know it hasn’t been easy,” Mrs Sinclair says; a friendly hand on Karen’s.

“It’s nothing,” Karen smiles. “It’s what we do for our community.”

“Mhm… nothing at all” says Ted. Karen glares at him.

The kids get up and race out of the door. “Lucas, Erika don’t forget - Squawk. 4pm” Mr Sinclair calls after them.

The kids retrieve their bikes and get going. Jonathan and Nancy take off in the car.

“You still haven’t told them, have you?” Mike asks.

“Not yet,” Lucas says. “I don’t want them to know until it’s too late.”

“You know your dumbass plan isn’t going to work right?” Erika cuts in. “Mom and Dad are going to kick your-“

“Erika shut up! We’re going to miss it!” Holly yells over her. “Will, Squawk!”

Will reaches forward and turns on the radio strapped to his handlebars. Immediately a voice fills the air;

“Good morning Hawkins! It’s another glorious day in our litttle quarantined corner of Indiana! My name is Rockin’ Robin and I’m here with your morning Squawk but first… a quick weather forecast. Today should be clear blue skies with the occasional patch of storm clouds, red storms and potentially deadly falling ash. Take an umbrella folks!”

The teens laugh as Robyn relays warnings about not playing near metal covers, the time for ration collections, curfew times and zone updates.

“Coming up soon is a song for all of the special people in our lives. Especially mine - sweetie, you know who you are. But first, here’s a new song that I think everyone here can relate to and enjoy…” a song starts. A song not heard before. The teens laugh again as the chorus comes in; “am I living in a box?”

At school, Dustin slouches through the near empty halls; dim eyes surveying everything with dull disgust. His old Hellfire Tee ripped, stained and stretched. The few students he passes look on. Fearful, suspicious.

SLAM! Before Dustin can think, he’s thrust against the lockers. One of the basketball players has him pinned; hands gripping his Hellfire top so tight, his knuckles are white.

“Hi Andy,” Dustin responds; not a trace of fear in his eyes as he surveys his aggressor calmly.

“How many times do I have to tell you not to wear that Goddamn murderer satanist shit?” Andy snarls, virtually nose-to-nose with Dustin.

“You don’t tell me what I can and can’t wear dipshit. Especially when you’re still clinging to your little costume,” he smirks. “You don’t even have a basketball team this year”

“Hellfire is over Henderson,” Andy growls, “When are you going to get it through your thick head?”

Without a word, Dustin throws his head forwards; smashing it into Andy’s before the latter could react. He stumbles back, releasing his grasp of Dustin’s clothes.

“You mean that thick head?” Dustin taunts, stepping forwards as Andy gets back on his feet. Andy pulls his arm back, hand curling into a first.

Just as the arm starts to move forwards, a black hand grabs it just below the elbow. The hand spins Andy around to face the newcomer; It’s Lucas. Standing proud; wide shoulders and surprisingly tight muscles.

“Hi Andy,” Lucas says confidently, “Do you remember when Erika kicked your little nuts so hard last year you could barely walk for a week?”

“Yeah,” Andy snarled; a tiny trace of embarrassment in his voice.

“You so much as look at Dustin again and I’ll kick them so hard they pop like water balloons,” he promised.

“Kick away Lucas,” Mike chimed in, approaching from the right. Will a step behind. Both glaring at Andy. “Why wait? You’ll be doing the world a favour by stopping him spreading his seed all over the place,” he added; looking Andy up and down with disgust.

“Nah,” said Lucas after considering, “I’ll give him one more chance. Get out of here.”

Dustin surges forwards down the corridor as Andy stalks off in the opposite direction. The other three pick up the pace as they struggle to catch up.

“I don’t need you guys to save my ass,” Dustin complains as the Party finally unite. “I can handle Andy on my own,”

“We know that,” Said Will,

“But that doesn’t mean you should be deliberately pissing him off!” Mike warned

If I miscategorized something there, feel free to point it out. Also I welcome any serious questions. ^-^

Hi, I’m 21-year-old male INTJ 2w1 with Asperger’s, c-PTSD and depersonalization. I’m trying to find some kind of alternative way out, because I’ve reached the conclusion that I can’t fix myself on my own anymore without landing into another damn loop.
I'm sorry if this post feels demanding or all over the place.
It sucks that once I started to understand who I am and my perspective worked, it became more of a burden than a blessing. I keep seeing loop after loop, knowing exactly what is happening, and still falling into the same patterns. In the end I just try to choose the “least bad” route instead of walking straight into the worst one. When I was younger, I was consistently typed as an INTP 9w1. That became a sort of mask and a way of functioning. [There was an event, where I could freet/change myself from that life.] After discovering that I’m actually an INTJ 2w1, I began to dig deeper into typology, trying to fix my problems bymyself. I was honestly flabbergasted and didn’t want to accept being an INTJ 2w1, because it is controversial and tends to immensely clashing each. I Still partl loathes it. I tend to go deeper and deeper into my thoughts, analyzing patterns to solve everything by myself and the thought ""to have to do it alone"", but I’m starting to realize that if I keep doing that, I’ll just dismantle myself further. At the same time, I know I somehow have to help myself, but not only by rationalizing everything.Now I’m aware of what I’m dealing with. I tell myself to “just live on,” put on a smile, and drink nihilism like my daily coffee. I see myself as a realist and a pragmatist. Also hate the fact about ""what have been seen can't be unseen"". My Self-acceptance that can wait forever. Most of my connections are broken because I was too avoidant, and any potential new connections get cut off because I see them as a possible threat or approaches are hard bc I'm too direct. This tendency to overshare is annoying. The pain doesn’t resolve; it just grows. I keep telling myself to shut up while at the same time craving connection, given by my situation and facts. Because of my attachment issues, I end up smashing what I actually want to build. 
I built a internal system that once helped me survive. Now it mostly just cages me in.
I’ve been in therapy and I’m planning to continue, but so far it feels pretty inefficient, slow and quite ineffective.
I recently became here more active bc my entire friend group got irreversible nuked. (An Dispute, I watched by the side about how it unfolded into haywire, into what had been predicted. ._.)

I’m not sure what to do next, so I’m posting here to see if anyone can relate or maybe offer a different perspective.

**Bottling Date:** Estimated to be 2024/2025 time range  
**Proof**: 119.5  
**Crafted by:** Master Distiller Elizabeth McCall

**Current Rated Score:** 8.5

*I have always enjoyed the Woodford Reserve label and overall, Brown-Forman products (Old Forester Single Barrels for sure).  I have been eye-balling (mean-mugging???) these high proof Woodford bottles for some time, but I could never bring myself to spend $140.00 for a 700ml bottle with a NAS.  Fortunately, in December 2025 I found this bottle at my Wayne, NJ Costco store at $74.99.  Immediate purchase.*

*Background of how my tastings go:  I always blind my bottles blind and in a flight of 4 similar labels.  I don't acknowledge a bottle's score until I have run a bottle in at least 3 blinds and I then throw out the lower and highest scores; averaging the remaining tastings.  I will score nose, finish and palate on a score of 1-10 in each category and I weight the categories at 30% nose, 50% palate, 20% finish.*

**Number of blind Flights:** 3  
**Flights won:** 2  
**Scores:** 8.5, 8.5, 8.0

**These are the bottles it beat:**  
x3 Stagg - Batch 25d (x3)  
x2 Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Toasted Barrel - Single Barrel Shoprite Liquors Shoprite Liquors Lackawanna, NJ  
x1 Elijah Craig - B25 (x1)  
x1 Old Forester SBBP \[L-1\] - Single Barrel Shoprite Liquors Lackawanna, NJ  (x1)  
x1 Old Forester SBBP \[I-8\] - Single Barrel Bourbon Street Liquors Phillipsburg, NJ (x1)

**This is the bottle it lost to:**  
x1 Old Forester SBBP \[H-7\] - Single Barrel Best Cellars Ledgewood, NJ (x1)

**Summary of Notes:**

**Nose:**  
Rich and evident butterscotch and caramel candy and melted caramel candy.  Strawberry and marshmallow are abundantly presence as some secondary notes.  Minor notes of maple syrup, coffee grinds and baking spice.

**Palate:**  
The caramel comes through in spades on the palate.  I got notes of caramel candy on two of the tastings and in one case a a charred fresh caramel.  Well aged leather and two separate tastings of a waning fresh cherry, almost an Elijah Craig sharp cherry.

**Finish:**  
The usual, some cinnamon hots candy (My favorite), baking spice that waning cherry note on the palate came through like a cherry lifesaver candy.  Some light notes of strawberry and chocolate (for me, milk chocolate is sweet, chocolate is more dry and bitter for my notes).

**Conclusion:**  
**Current score of 8.5.**  It is a ""Buy again"", which I did but now Costco was charging $125.00.  Personally, my top shelf whiskey collection (un-cracked) only includes bottles that meet the following requirements:

1. It has a score on my scoreboard (Meaning, at least 3 blind tastings)
2. It has to score well (obviously)
3. I have some extensive, documented notes from the tastings that I can share when I want to crack that bottle with friends

Things were on a downswing towards the end and we never found time to have the difficult conversations about what we needed to do to reconnect and stay committed after being together so long. Unfortunately, 5 months ago I found out she was cheating on me for pretty much the entire time that I thought things were getting tough between us. 

Anyways, I’ve done my grieving and my healing and I’m ready to put myself back out there. I recently went on a coffee date with a girl that turned into us talking for hours longer than expected, and we have had some good rapport over the phone every day since. I’m taking her to a nice restaurant on Friday as a more formal and official date. I could really see us together in the future if things stay on the right track. 

My ex was a really big part of my life and lived with me for a while. With the new girl I have mentioned an old roommate who moved out a few months ago and have been a little vague in any stories that include my ex. Like I said, I’m over her and ready for the next chapter in my life. I have a lot of great memories with my ex including most of high school and all of college, but I don’t want to come off sounding like I still wish she was a part of my life.

Following on from my last post on here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/s/M7TZLlMNCz](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/s/M7TZLlMNCz)) (for those interested in context), my NM and I went NC for 2.5 years. Actually, in large part this wasn’t necessarily my choosing, but it did give me the push I needed and I realised how much happier I am without her in my life.

The Christmas after my last post, I tried to reconcile; my (now ex-partner) and I went to drop off a gift for her on Christmas Day and she slammed the door in my face saying she doesn’t want to see me. Not too long after this, my ex-partner and I broke up (unrelated) and I went travelling. 

Somewhere in amongst all of that I met my now husband. He is the most wonderful man, endlessly patient, gentle, caring, giving. I truly do not know how I got so lucky to find him right when I needed him the most. 

My husband and I have been in transatlantic LDR since, and eloped in North Carolina in May— no family or friends, literally just us. We needed to get married in order to begin the process of closing the gap.

Nonetheless, we have been set from the get go on arranging a vow renewal/reception as it will be the only opportunity to get all of our loved ones from the UK and the US to meet and mingle. We are planning on hiring out an estate next year with lodging on-site in the states for an entire weekend so everybody has a good chance of interacting and getting to know one another.

Now, my mum and I have been VLC over the last 6 months or so. I reached out and told her that we were getting married in May, she congratulated me. We’ve had some very superficial message conversations since then, but always when I have initiated them. I tried to ask about our family dogs and she told me they died, and she didn’t want to talk about it (those dogs were my life at one point). What I’m trying to say is that although there hasn’t been any overt abuse since I’ve slowly re-initiated some contact, she still hasn’t got the emotional maturity to discuss things like an adult or to acknowledge my emotions. To be completely honest, the driver behind me still reaching out is mainly other family members who constantly drone on about how I should be reaching out, reconciling yada yada despite me trying every which way to asset that it’s none of their business/it’s my relationship to manage/they don’t understand the level of hurt this relationship imposes on me etc. 

My partner was recently visiting over the holidays and his birthday in December, and I told my mum a few weeks beforehand and invited her to coffee with us so that they could meet. She told me she would be too busy, and never made the effort to even try despite having multiple weeks of notice in advance. 

I didn’t even realise that the above upset me but I found myself in my triggered state for a couple of weeks seemingly out of nowhere— it wasn’t until I told my best friend about the above and she expressed that she feels the cycle is re-starting again with my mum throwing me breadcrumbs in being engaging over text, only to let me down again and how this has probably opened some old wounds. 

I am just so torn on whether to continue to try. In my mind there is a chance that we could reconcile but simultaneously I feel as though that is just an illusion, I shouldn’t trust that she is capable of change at this ripe old age (60). 

I know that if I don’t invite her to our wedding, and move to the US this year, that will be the final nail in the coffin and we will never speak again— she will not forgive me. I am also so damn tired of setting boundaries with people who drone on at me to reconcile and know I will inadvertently attract backlash if I do not invite her. 

There is also a high chance that even if I invite her, she will not come. The wedding is in a different country, she could not even make the effort to meet us for a coffee in her home town… 

Looking back at the last 3 years without her in my life, they have been the most transformative, healing, abundant years and I truly never imagined life could be this wonderful. I have so much love, so many opportunities, and everything is just “falling into place”. I don’t think this is necessarily a coincidence.

Any thoughts are welcome. I am torn.

I’m pretty aggressively frugal. Not in a “never spend money” way, but in a “I need a reason” way. I track spending, delay purchases, DIY whenever it makes sense. Most of the time it works.

But back pain relief products mess with my usual logic.
With most things, going cheap just means lower quality or inconvenience. Bad coffee tastes bad. Cheap shoes wear out. You shrug and move on. With back pain, the cost feels delayed and harder to measure.

I tried ignoring it at first. Told myself posture fixes and stretching were free, so I should start there. That helped a bit. Then I added small things. Then I stopped again because it felt silly to keep buying “solutions.”

What complicates it is uncertainty. You can’t test a lot of these things properly without time. A mattress, for example, isn’t something you evaluate in a weekend. Same with support items or adjustments. You don’t know if it helped or if your body just had a good week.
That uncertainty makes frugality harder. Spending money without clear ROI goes against the whole mindset. But so does waking up stiff every day and pretending that has no cost.

I’ve noticed people in this sub are split. Some say never spend, adapt your body. Others say health is the one thing you don’t optimize for price.
I don’t have a clean answer. I just know back pain turned into the one area where my spreadsheets stopped giving me confidence.

Curious how other frugal folks navigate this without feeling like they’re either wasting money or sacrificing their body.

I know, there is a middle way, not overdoing everything, etc, but if your personality is rather doing something with 100% effort or not doing, it is hella annoying (for me at least) not to go crazy.

Waking up? Same time every day if possible, because sleeping too long would mess with my sleep schedule. Use a spatula to clean tongue in the morning, it is good to get rid of bacteria. No coffee on an empty stomach, so first let's eat something. It has to contain enough of the macro nutrients, so thoughtfully selected, no only a random croissant or so. During eating, ideally no phone or tv, mind needs a booting time, also it is not healthy to shock my mind with socials, so trying to stay away from that as well. Making the bed afterwards, because if I let it flop, the day might flop as well. Using sun protection on face, even in winter, even in cloudy days, because of the UVA or UVB, or any kind of the UV goes through even the clouds and ages your skin, and skincancer and whatnot. Flossing. Should I in the morning as well? Nah, ima do it only in the evening, but I HAVE to do it every day in the evening.

And I've just woken up.

Am I compulsive? To an extent. If the said things are not happening, I don't feel like the world is gonna end, I KNOW that it is fine, but I am annoyed if for example I can't go to sleep at the same time every day, because then my sleep cycle is fucked for the coming day, which results in tiredness, grogginess, etc.

I saw the 1zpresso line (Q air, Q, J, X-Ultra, ZP6...) but not sure if Q air or Q would be nice upgrades or if I need to go to the X-Ultra or ZP6 models to get a subtantial improve.

1qi00f5,https://i.redd.it/u9r7j0j61ieg1.png,Beta testers needed to explore The Towering Dungeon!,"Hi everyone,

We posted a few months ago some screenshots of The Towering Dungeon and your comments helped us a lot to improve it. They were also super encouraging so we thank you for that!  
We just released the first version of our demo. It is a beta version so nothing is really final, but the feeling is there.

We'd love to hear from you. The feedback of Tower Defense lovers (or at least TD enthusiasts) is invaluable. Our questions are:  
\- Do you love our game as much as we do?  
\- What would you like to see added in the future? (there's an indicative roadmap in the game, you can comment on it)  
\- Are some heroes/items/monsters too strong or too weak?  
\- And if you find some glitches or bugs, don't hesitate to tell us.

For those who missed the first discussion, here's a small description of The Towering Dungeon:

>Dive into a one-of-a-kind Tower Defense experience that blends exploration, strategy, and RPG.  
Explore the titanic floors of the Towering Dungeon, uncover magical treasures, and unearth secrets long forgotten.  
Recruit and unlock powerful heroes, train and equip them, and forge the ultimate team, whether it’s built for glory… or chaos.  
Face relentless waves of monsters: from colossal ogres and spider swarms to disciplined orc legions and hordes of goblins.  
Climb to the very top and unveil the greatest secret in the universe.

And this is our very small team:

SuperBidi, developer, I-Ko, artist, and Lyda, musician. A team of 3, long days, short nights, dedication and a lot of coffee, all you need to make a good game!

1qhzz8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaJobs/comments/1qhzz8j/my_bosses_make_7_figures_and_their_lifes_dream_is/,My bosses make 7 figures and their life's dream is to open a fruit stall. This Corporate dream feels like a very lame joke.,"I'm 38 years old, from a very ordinary middle-class background, and the playbook I was raised on was simple: work your ass off → find a 'good' job → make tons of money → happiness will find you. The default settings for a 'good life', you know?

Anyway, I finally reached a good position and started attending the meetings where the important decisions are made. I was sitting next to my bosses and their circle during lunch (all in their late forties, all making insane money  we're talking 7 figures). I thought they'd be talking about their portfolios or their new vacation home.

Not at all. The conversation turned into a heart-to-heart.

These people were talking with utmost seriousness about how much they want to leave all of this and open a fruit stall, or a small coffee cart, or sell tacos from a food truck. They genuinely romanticized this simple life, a life of weighing apples for people.

Imagine this. You're at the top of the corporate pyramid, looking at the guy at the coffee cart and thinking, Wow, I'd trade places with him in a second.

This was my light bulb moment. I spent 25 years working myself to the bone to achieve the same lifestyle these people are dying to escape. If the people who have supposedly 'won' are all looking for the emergency exit, what am I even grinding for?

I'm starting to feel the same way. It reminds me of the Alan Watts quote: The desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing. Because if my version of success means I can't sleep because of a PowerPoint presentation and I end up dreaming of making sandwiches, then I've been sold a faulty dream.

Is this just an early mid life crisis, or is the whole corporate race just a ladder to a fancier cage?

TL;DR: I heard my millionaire bosses confessing they're miserable and wish they were selling coffee. Now I'm re evaluating my entire life, starting from elementary school.",92,1768912624.0,CanadaJobs,56,0.88,False

1qhzz0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismIreland/comments/1qhzz0p/cdnt_issues/,CDNT issues.,"Anyone found CDNT to be bloody useless? Completed the AON 2.5 years ago, they referred our two kids to the CDNT. Had an assessment 2 years ago, CDNT basically outsourced it to some private place in south dublin. Few months later a written report, the radio silence.

3 months ago they start sending us invites to parent workshops, most of which are not of value or in anyway related to our kids needs. For example they invite us to workshops on adult anxiety and adult learning, etc. 2 out of about 10 were appropriate as my kids are under 5. So about as useful as a fart in a spacesuit. 

Anyway I phone them last week only to be told one has been referred back to primary care via the AON and they other will continue with the CDNT with the BS coffee mornings and workshops. No 1to1 therapy sessions as that's not the service they offer. Both kids were recommended for SLT and OT

So 2.5 years after a diagnosis and sweet fuck all services. Why good is bloody parent driven stuff if the parent isn't capable/qualified to determine  if an approach is suitable or working? Christ I had 1to1 SLT with a private therapist that insisted over the course of 6 months on trying to get them to use corecards instead of adapting to something else. Suffice to say, we switched therapist.

There's a particular magic in the moment just before brewing. It's the release of volatile aromatics as your grinder transforms whole beans into fragrant grounds. But to truly capture that ephemeral beauty, the \*freshness\* of those beans is paramount. Generic supermarket coffee, often roasted weeks or months prior, has already lost its most vibrant potential by the time it reaches your grinder. At Intelligentsia, we believe the journey from farm to cup should be a testament to quality at every step.

Our commitment starts with **Direct Trade**. We don't just buy coffee; we cultivate deep, lasting relationships with farmers, often paying significantly above market rates for truly exceptional harvests. This allows us unparalleled insight into the beans' origin and quality. Then comes our unique **Roast-to-Order** process. Your coffee isn't waiting on a shelf; it's roasted precisely when you order it and shipped immediately. This ensures that the rich, nuanced flavors are at their absolute peak when they arrive at your door, ready for your grinder.

Why does this matter for your morning ritual?

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Our roast dates are your guarantee of vibrant aroma and flavor, unlike mass-produced alternatives.
*   **Exceptional Quality:** Direct Trade partnerships ensure we source some of the world's most remarkable coffees.
*   **Flavor Clarity:** Experience the true character of the bean, from bright floral notes to syrupy chocolatey finishes, unclouded by age.

For an unparalleled espresso experience, explore our legendary **Black Cat Espresso**. Or, discover the evolving palate of our roasters with an **Intelligentsia Subscription**, featuring always free shipping and a curated selection of our finest coffees.

I (27F) have a decent laptop I use for freelance stuff and honestly just life admin. My cousin ""Mia"" (19F) is in college and called me freaking out because her cheap school laptop died the week before finals. She asked if she could borrow mine for 4 days just to type papers and upload them. I hesitated, but she promised she would only use it for school, no food or drinks near it, and she would keep it in her dorm. I even made her a separate user profile so she wouldnt mess with my files. She picked it up, thanked me a million times, and that was that.



When she dropped it back off, she was weirdly rushed. Like, handed it to me and said ""it works, I logged out"" and bolted. I opened it later and immediately noticed the keyboard felt sticky, and some keys were kinda crunchy. It also smelled like sweet coffee or maybe an energy drink. The screen would flicker every so often, and the trackpad would randomly stop clicking. I texted her and she swore nothing happened and that maybe it was ""already like that"". I know my own laptop, it was fine the day she took it. I took it to a repair shop and they said liquid had gotten under the keyboard and started corroding stuff. They cleaned what they could but told me it might keep acting up and the keyboard would probaly need replacing. The quote was $260. I sent Mia a pic of the receipt and asked her to cover it, even if she had to pay in installments. She said she ""doesnt have that kind of money"" and that I was being dramatic because she needs money for school. Her mom then messaged me saying family helps family and I shouldnt ""punish"" Mia over an accident, and that I chose to lend it so I accepted the risk. Now half my relatives are acting like I’m a villain for asking a college kid to pay, and Mia is telling people I’m trying to ruin her finals week (which is already over??). I feel like if you borrow someone’s stuff and damage it, you make it right, even if it's awkward.



TL;DR: Lent my cousin my laptop for finals, it came back with liquid damage and repair costs. I asked her to pay and my family says I'm a jerk for it.

If you’re planning a trip and want to save money without ruining the experience, here’s what genuinely worked for me.

🍜 1. Eat Like a Local (Not a Tourist)
Food can be cheap if you avoid tourist restaurants.
1 Convenience stores are lifesavers: kimbap, .   . ramen, dosirak (lunch boxes), fried chicken, coffee
2 Street food markets are affordable and filling
3 Local Korean restaurants usually have cheaper lunch menus
4 Eat where office workers eat  that’s the real hack
👉 Average meal cost for me: 5,000–8,000 KRW

🚆 2. Use Public Transport Only
Korea’s public transport is one of the best and cheapest in the world.
1  Buy a T-money card as soon as you arrive
2 Subways and buses cover almost every tourist spot
3 Walking between nearby attractions saves money and shows you real Korea
4 Avoid taxis unless you’re splitting costs with friends
👉 Subway/bus rides usually cost 1,300–1,800 KRW

🏨 3. Skip Hotels, Choose Guesthouses or Hostels
Hotels add up fast. Instead:
1 Stay in hostels or guesthouses (many are super clean and social)
2 Hanok guesthouses can be cheaper and more memorable
3 Some hostels include free breakfast
4 Booking early = better deals
👉 Dorm beds: 20,000–30,000 KRW per night

🎟️ 4. Enjoy Free Attractions
One of the best things about Korea is how many places are free.
1 Palaces often have free days or free entry if you wear hanbok
2  Parks, riversides, temples, and neighborhoods cost nothing
3 Museums and cultural centers often have free exhibitions
👉 Some of my best days cost zero for attractions

🛍️ 5. Shop & Snack Smart
1 Convenience stores are cheaper for small meals 
. than supermarkets
2 Night markets have cheaper souvenirs than malls
3 Avoid buying everything from tourist shops
4 Daiso is amazing for cheap essentials and souvenirs

💡 6. Daily Money-Saving Habits
Small habits make a big difference:
1.  Carry a reusable water bottle
2.Use KakaoMap or Naver Map instead of taxis
3. Avoid unnecessary tours explore solo
 Travel slower  fewer cities = less transport cost

💸 What I Spent Per Day (Approx.)
Accommodation: 25,000 KRW
Food: 15,000–20,000 KRW
Transport: 5,000–8,000 KRW
 Attractions: Mostly free
👉 Total: Around 45,000–55,000 KRW per day
🌏 Final Thoughts

South Korea doesn’t have to be expensive. If you eat local, use public transport, and avoid tourist traps, you can experience the country fully without overspending. Some of my favorite memories came from simple walks, late-night convenience store meals, and free viewpoints.

1qhzpq9,https://i.redd.it/kcg7lpm0zheg1.jpeg,Which banknote do Albanians use the most? - SCAN analysis: What the banknotes show about the Albanian economy - Albania,"Every day, Albanians pay in cash for coffee, food or small services. But which banknote passes from hand to hand most often? And which holds the largest share of cash in the economy?

Data from the Bank of Albania show that the answer is not as straightforward as it seems and varies depending on how the use of cash is measured.

If we talk about the number of banknotes in circulation, i.e. the denominations that are most often used in daily payments, it turns out that the most present are the 1,000 and 2,000 ALL banknotes. They are the denominations that circulate most often in ordinary citizens' transactions, in small purchases and routine payments.

But the panorama changes when the analysis is done in monetary value. According to the structure of cash in circulation, the banknote that carries the largest weight is the 5,000 ALL banknote. Not because it is used more often than other denominations, but because it represents a higher value per unit and concentrates a significant portion of physical money in the economy.

The Bank of Albania's reports show that the structure of banknotes has changed gradually, but without being reversed, despite strong shocks such as the pandemic, the increase in inflation or the introduction into circulation of the 10,000 ALL banknote. Even after these developments, the 5,000 Lek denomination continues to remain the main axis of cash in value.

At the same time, the total number of banknotes in circulation in Albania has remained relatively stable. In the last five years, it is estimated at around 150 to 160 million pieces, indicating that changes are not happening in quantity, but in the way cash is used.

One of the main reasons is related to the gradual shift of small payments towards electronic means. Small denominations, such as 200, 500 and 1,000 ALL, are used less today than before, while bank cards and transfers are replacing cash in frequent payments. This explains why the number of banknotes in circulation remains stable, while their role in the economy is being reshaped.

Another trend evidenced by the reports is that banknotes are ""living"" longer. They are replaced and disposed of less often in relation to the total stock, an indication that cash is circulating more slowly and is being kept longer outside the banking system.

Data show that cash in Albania is not disappearing, but is changing its function: from a daily means of payment, to an instrument of safeguarding and financial security.
