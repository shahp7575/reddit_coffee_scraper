They were laughing and sharing stories, totally engrossed in the moment. It got me thinking... How often do I let myself just enjoy the present? I've been so focused on my career lately, kinda obsessed with hitting milestones and deadlines. 

Seeing them, so content and present, was like a gentle reminder that life isn't just about ticking boxes. It's about moments and connections too. I realized I need to stop occasionally and actually savor the cup of coffee in front of me, both literally and metaphorically. Does anyone else feel like they need to slow down sometimes or is it just me? ☕",1,1745438951.0,NormaldayEpiphanies,0,1.0,False

1k68wyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1k68wyo/for_6_months_straight_me_and_this_guy_have_been/,"For 6 Months Straight, Me and This Guy Have Been Playing the Most Confusing Game of “Do You Like Me or Not?”","There’s this guy—let’s call him *Jake*. For the past *six months*, we’ve been caught in this confusing, slow-burn, totally unspoken situationship that feels straight out of a moody indie film. He used to never look at me, but ever since I changed up my aesthetic, it’s like he’s been hyper-aware of my existence.

It started small. One day in the canteen, he lined up behind me with his friends. I got my coffee, went to use the sugar table, and politely asked him to move—he did, said “Oh, sorry.” Harmless, right? But the vibe was weird. Charged.

The very next day, I’m at independent study. I sit in this quiet little cubicle. Ten minutes later, *Jake* shows up—and sits *right next to me*. Says *nothing*. Just silently sits there, stealing glances, leaning back, lowkey staring the entire time like I’m an exhibit at a museum. I go to the bathroom, come back—he’s still watching. What even?

And it doesn’t stop there. Every time I go to independent study, he waits. Like, *waits outside or nearby* until I’ve already gone in—then he comes in later. Like he’s trying not to be obvious about showing up when I do… but it's totally obvious. If I change my seat, he still finds a spot where he can see me. One time, his entire friend group slowly filed in and sat around me like some awkward fan club. I freaked out and left.

Right before Christmas break, I sat somewhere different, totally hidden behind a wall. I overheard him talking to a friend: *“She sat there last time, why can’t she just sit there again?”* His friend told him to talk to me, and he goes, *“No, come forward.”* Like, sir?? What are we doing?

After the break, I stopped going to independent study. Thought it would fade. But then he started showing up super early to *learning support*. Even after being off sick for weeks, he came back and picked up where he left off—early arrival, soft glances, total avoidance of anything resembling conversation.

One time, I walked in and saw him sitting in the seat *next to* mine—the one a girl usually sits in. For a second, I genuinely wondered: *Was he trying to sit next to me? Or was he just talking to the teacher?* When I looked confused, he gently asked, “Should I move?” I said it was fine, but inside I was spiraling.

Another day, I was chilling on a bench near the grass, and I see him and his whole squad come out of the canteen. They just *stand there across the field*, fully watching me. Like, not even pretending. I knew they recognized me—my khaki brown Carhartt jacket isn’t exactly subtle. I ended up walking across the grass just to avoid them.

And the worst part? He is 100% my type. Tall, skinny, pale, cheekbones, wavy dark hair, slightly frizzy, perfect big nose with a bump. His style? Too good. Like, painfully attractive in a “this is gonna ruin me” kind of way.

But after *six months* of eye contact, silent stalking, and zero actual words exchanged, I still don’t know: is this a crush? A social experiment? An unspoken Cold War of feelings? Because I swear we’re trapped in a never-ending staring contest with no resolution in sight.

Please note,  I hate complaining or causing future karma by bad-mouthing people, places, and things.  BUT - I am making an exception.

  
**Do NOT be fooled** .. what started with decent and helpful service during the quote process quickly turned into a terrifying ordeal. It was a stressful and financially draining nightmare marked by significant unexpected price increases, hidden packaging fees, unlicensed movers, rudeness, and threats.

While Safe Ship does disclose that they operate as a broker, they guarantee their brokers are certified and licensed. **The movers who arrived in Chicago were not licensed to drive their moving truck**. When I confronted them about this, they fabricated a ridiculous excuse, claiming the truck was too large to be driven into Chicago.

When I called this out, their reaction escalated to threats: **they threatened to dump all of my furniture on the side of the road, in the middle of a snowstorm, unless I paid for a U-Haul for their illegal operation -** an unexpected increase of almost $1000 on my final bill. It felt like a blatant act of coercion and potential endangerment.

Furthermore, despite claiming they ""take care of everything,"" Safe Ship completely failed to disclose their packaging fees. **Be warned: they will charge you extra to wrap essential furniture items like your sofa and even a simple coffee table.**

The initial quote I received was significantly lower than the final bill, which ballooned due to the U-Haul fiasco and hidden packaging expenses. This **bait-and-switch tactic** seems to be common practice for them based on the reviews.

While they were initially accommodating when providing the quote, once my furniture was picked up, their attitude and level of service went completely out the window.

1k68tzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/1k68tzq/advice_regarding_the_behavior_of_a_fellow_employee/,Advice regarding the behavior of a fellow employee,"I'm here because I'd like to ask for some opinions with regards to a suggested course of action about a situation that is currently
happening at my place of employment. TLDR: a new employee blurs the lines between stupidity, gross lack of skills, and
malevolence (yes, malevolence, not malicious compliance).

I work at company which, among other departments, has a relatively small internal IT department. I'm part of the R&D department
and, due to my specific role, I closely interact with the IT guys. As in any company, people from all departments come and go –
some find better or closer to home jobs, others take their maternity/paternity time off, and others get fired, albeit rarely. Naturally,
new employees come in, get on-boarded, sign contracts, made aware of the 90 days probation period and of the restrictions that
pertain to their specific job duties, etc. Such is the case in the IT department – a new employee which, at the time of the interview
made a great impression and was hired with ""IT support"" responsibilities, bringing the total IT department employees to 3
including the department lead.

During the probation period the new employee, which for sake of this text we'll name ""Mikidutza"", acted and performed his job
flawlessly*, with small corrective nudges from the other 2 colleagues, ""Yoda"" and ""Boba"". It's worth mentioning that the
department lead, Yoda, does not act like a boss, but instead tries to take on the role of a teacher, helping the department do its best
job. Thus, Yoda is generally a laid-back person, easy to talk to, knows a ton of stuff, and if you want to understand why your
computer is doing what you don't understand, Yoda will patiently explain. Amongst other things such as handling trouble tickets,
the IT department is tasked with maintaining the physical access control system (ACS). If one employee forgets the access badge
home, the reception emails the IT to activate a temp access card and within the span of 5 minutes, the forgetful employee gains
access. Also, because it's using the IT infrastructure, the surveillance system (CCTV) is also their responsibility.

In our office building, there is a restricted area in which very few employees are given access to, Yoda being on approved list –
someone had to deploy the crap that's in there, and only a handful of other employees. During on-boarding, new employees are
made aware of the fact that different areas of the building are video recorded, aware of certain restrictions, including the possibility
that there might be restricted areas in the building, the rules for events such as finding yourself looking at a white-painted metal
door that's ostentatiously marked with big red letters ""Restricted Area"", and the need-to-know basis of said area. In short, if an
employee is not specifically made aware that said employee is granted access to the restricted area, they better not be trying to
access said restricted area. And nobody should be there (regardless of how they got in) if they aren't specifically approved to be
there unless they're really curious to know how it feels to be escorted out of a building while wearing handcuffs. Not a joke. In
the ACS, the card reader for the door to the restricted area is inconspicuously named. You'd have to know what you're looking for
in order to find it and make modifications. We'll name this door, for the sake of this text, as ""RA"" for Restricted A.

I believe that any employee starting fresh at a company will undergo an accommodation period. So, it is only natural that until the
person learns how things are done, they will undoubtedly falter. In other words, everyone makes mistakes, we're only human,
especially in a new environment where one might feel that their new colleagues are watching, sizing up who the FNG is. Mistakes
are there to build experience, of course, if we own up to them, and we're willing to learn from them and move on to being a better
person.

On the 91st day of employment (1st day after the probation period elapsed), Mikidutza's access badge pops up as ""access denied
RA"" notification which the ACS emailed to the IT department lead, the CTO, the CSO, and the CEO. The CSO notified HR and
within a few days Mikidutza was receiving his first written reprimand, with the reminder that at this company a third written
reprimand is considered the third strike and is grounds for automatic and immediate dismissal. In the years that the RA has been
there, Mikidutza is the only employee who swiped his badge without explicitly being granted access ahead of time. In other words,
Mikidutza is the only person whose info shows up in red on any access reports for that specific door. Thanks to this incident, we
know for sure that the alert-via-email system works as expected. So, there's that! Also, Mikidutza's access to the to ACS gets
suspended.

Around 1 month after the RA event, Mikidutza develops a crush on one of the finance department's newly hired employees. We'll
name the employee ""Excel"". Mikidutza aimed to start some sort of relationship with Excel. I know about this episode because
Mikidutza showed me, at the office, the bouquet of flowers, earrings, and candy that he planned on gifting in his pursuit for
romance with Excel. In the ""show and tell"" discussion with Mikidutza, I attempted to be the voice of reason and point out the
obvious challenges he's facing. Mainly, this kind of romantic pursuit should not be happening in a work setting, especially where
everyone is expected to be professional (yes, he asked why as if completely unaware of any potential harassment issues). The
other thing I wanted to get across was that there may be a very high probability that Mikidutza misinterpreted some of the signals
he received from Excel (""maybe she was just being nice?"" kind of deal using different words). It didn't stick so my last question
was ""Are you sure you want to do this, here, at work, 8 workdays since you've professionally met Excel?"" However, my crack at
rational reasoning was met with confident arrogance along the lines ""C'mon, would Excel say these things if she wasn't interested
in something romantically next level with me? You don't know, man, I've been through some relationships and know enough to
read these things. I know what women want."" However, it didn't go very far. I'm not sure Excel mentioned anything to the HR
department.

Around 1 months after the failed Excel pursuit, Yoda gets separate calls, on separate days within the span of the same week, from
HR which can be condensed as follows: ""warning, please ensure that anyone with access to the CCTV is using it reasonably.""
Yoda called Mikidutza and he confirmed that he was indeed using the CCTV but because he could not immediately articulate a
reason for doing so, Yoda instructed Mikidutza to no longer use the CCTV for the day. Apparently, Mikidutza was using the
CCTV to keep track of where Excel was in the building, throughout the day. This fact was found out when network traffic was
analyzed (at a later date) and it led to the suspension of Mikidutza's access to the CCTV since the second explanation Mikidutza
provided (""I just wanted to see how the surveillance system works"") just wasn't believable.

In the next few months, Mikidutza's behavior was somewhat normal, but not quite within the parameters some might expect. Hear
me out. For example, the questions that Mikidutza was asking during the course of performing regular IT support duties are not
the questions that someone with similar qualifications should ask. At first, when I started to notice the questions, I believed that I
am being overly paranoid at the thought that a person who is hired to perform a specific set of tasks based on a specific set of
skills according to a specific set of qualifications (which Mikidutza showed at hire time) does not know how to perform even the
basic steps (the beginning steps, such as planning for unforeseen outcomes, if you will) of an IT-related procedure (RDP back into
a machine whose IP is now DHCP-assigned but was static just before you remotely changed its connection settings, as one of the
many examples). Considering that I'm remote most days of the week and come in only to physically change out the test hardware,
my level of interaction with Mikidutza is minimal when compared to his IT colleagues. Even so, I surprised myself thinking ""does
Mikidutza really belong in the IT field? Why is this person doing asking these basic questions?"" but immediately decided to not
pay attention to this train of thought, because I sometimes think of myself as ""lost"" in the multitude of things I deal with,
professionally. I guess I might have some sort of mild ""impostor syndrome"" going on. I felt borderline ashamed thinking that
Mikidutza might be an impostor, so I dismissed the thought and instead chose to think that it's always a positive when someone
is willing to learn and is actively asking questions, obviously trying to better themselves.

One day, about 2 months after the CCTV access suspension, Yoda and I are having a conversation about some of the IT equipment
which needs upgrading since some is terribly past EOL, and how he needs to plan out and distribute the tasks associated with the
upgrade among all 3 guys from IT, with the new equipment on its way. One thing leads to another and Mikidutza comes up in the
conversation. Yoda is hesitant to admit things aren't quite within the expected parameters with Mikidutza. I tell him that anything
has a solution as long as we know the details. Yoda finally comes out with all the accumulated frustration since Mikidutza's been
hired. ""It's as if the guy has no freaking clue what needs to be done in order to address the trouble tickets that are popping up""
says Yoda.

- Come on, Yoda, are you saying Mikidutza is… what… exactly? Not understanding the assigned tasks?
- No, the assigned tasks are being understood, but only after I explain how said tasks must be done. I'm talking basic stuff.
On top of that, he's constantly rambling about how different equipment at the house is either not working properly,
exhibiting horrible networking symptoms, or is not working at all. Why are the symptoms horrible? Because from his
explanations, I just can't understand why stuff is not working. It all should be functioning, according to what he says, but
it just isn't.
- Whose equipment? And whose house are we talking about, Yoda?
- Mikidutza's house, man, obviously. Cuz around here, at work, I keep on fixing the stuff in the trouble tickets Mikidutza
labeled as ""closed"", after being closed.

I wanted to type out this dialogue to attempt to convey the frustration Yoda is manifesting in this particular conversation. Normally
Yoda is calm, but now he's is gripping the chair's armrests as the conversation unfolds. Needless to say, the thought that I dismissed
awhile back about the impostor is now coming back into my head. I tell Yoda about it and Yoda retorts saying ""I've been having
the same thought, but since I've been part of the screening and hiring process, I felt guilty that maybe I've been having unrealistic
expectations."" After a few more exchanges, we both agree to chalk up our oddly similar thoughts to maybe being too rigid and
judgmental, maybe we've been going about reading people the wrong way, since we're both aware of the fact that IT folks can
sometimes be out of tune with some of the social queues other folks have no trouble picking up on. We decide that we will have
a status-update conversation with Mikidutza if and when time allows.

Next day, Mikidutza gets assigned to deal with the CEO's secretary's PC via a trouble ticket. Thirty minutes later, Mikidutza is
back at his desk, closing out the secretary's trouble ticket as solved, browsing TikTok, waiting for the next trouble ticket, in that
order. Sometime after lunch, Yoda gets a call from the CEO. Mikidutza was unable to solve the issue in the trouble ticket so IT
department, particularly Mikidutza, should stop worrying about trying to find a solution, since the secretary figured it out after a
3-minute search on google. Very little made sense about the call since Yoda checked the trouble ticket and it showed as solved
and closed by Mikidutza. What was clear from the call was that the CEO was somewhat disappointed. When Yoda asked
Mikidutza what transpired during the intervention, Mikidutza said nothing out of the ordinary happened, the secretary had newly
purchased hardware that needed some drivers. Mikidutza installed them and that was the end of it. Mikidutza was completely
unaware of any need for the secretary to have performed additional steps after he left. Nothing more was spoken of the intervention
but the overall feeling that the CEO's secretary might've performed better than the IT personnel checked a box in Yoda's mind.

At this point, it's worth mentioning that Yoda is also conversing with Boba about the questions Mikidutza is asking. Boba also
noticed the questions and thought something isn't quite as it should be, and wasn't quite sure how to approach the situation. Boba's
reasoning was that learning is a different process for everyone so maybe with enough time and enough guidance, Mikidutza will
acquire the needed experience and know-how. So now, there are 3 folks: Yoda, Boba, and I, who are thinking that they are noticing
things about Mikidutza.

The day of the IT equipment upgrade rolls around (a few weeks after the secretary trouble ticket): Yoda, Boba, and Mikidutza are
all hunched over the servers, reading all the shiny colored labels. Some of the devices need to be configured via a serial-to-USB
adapter. The adapter is in one of the drawers in Yoda's desk. Problem is the adapter is fried, so Yoda wants to send Mikidutza
over to the mechatronics office to get their serial-to-USB adapter. When Yoda calls Mikidutza over to his desk to show him what
he needs to ask from the other guys, the adapter is not in the drawer. Yoda remembers putting the adapter in the drawer because
he's the one who received back from the mechatronics guys, already fried. So makes no sense for the mechatronics guys to have
taken it back. The next day, Boba tells Yoda that he noticed, as Yoda was digging around in the drawer, Mikidutza was unusually
lacking the curiosity that everyone's been accustomed to dealing with. In other words, no questions about what the adapter is be
used for, no suggestions about possible locations where Yoda might've forgotten said adapter, not asking Boba if he knows
anything about the adapter that Yoda's looking for, not helping to look for it in some of the other drawers. Nothing. He's just
standing ten feet away from where the drawer-digging is happening, looking at Yoda, as if waiting.

A day later, Mikidutza tells Yoda that he found a serial-to-USB adapter for sale on some classified ads website for a ridiculously
cheap price and he bought it. The price was so unusually low that, the story can be true only if the seller didn't know what he/she
was selling, as estimated by Yoda. Apparently, Mikidutza needs the adapter for the equipment he already has at his house but only
realized he needs such an adapter after the work equipment needed to be configured post upgrade. Yoda grows suspicious of the
timing. Where did the serial-to-USB adapter go from where it was last seen in the drawer?

About 2 weeks after the equipment upgrade, Mikidutza gets a BSOD on his workstation. After a few unsuccessful diagnostic
attempts, he performs an OS recovery procedure and calls Yoda to inform him about the steps he took so far. Yoda tells him that
if he can wait, he should refrain from doing anything else to the workstation so that proper diagnostics can be performed, to find
out the source of the problem. If waiting is not an option, then Mikidutza should format the workstation's SSD and hold off from
anything else. After hanging up with Yoda, Mikidutza tells Boba that Yoda okayed re-adding the workstation to the active
directory (AD). Boba, hearing that Yoda okayed the task, does as requested. Yoda calls Boba and asks if Mikidutza requested that
his workstation be re-added to the AD, Boba confirms, Yoda immediately instructs Boba to change the password for the account
that was used to re-add the workstation to the AD. Yoda comes into the office a few hours later and learns that Mikidutza's
workstation has been re-added to the AD. When confronted, Boba says he did like Yoda asked, which Yoda confirmed was not
what he instructed. They both confronted Mikidutza which said he misheard what Yoda said and apologized, but did confirm that
his SSD was formatted.

Further context: 9 days later, Yoda was performing routine maintenance on the EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
controller. When done, Yoda checked the ability of the controller by remotely issuing a virus-scan request on the IT workstations.
The scan found a virus in the Edge browser cache folder on Mikidutza's workstation. Yoda took the file to VirusTotal and found
out the threat was 6 days old. Thus, Yoda finds out that the virus found on Mikidutza's workstation pings a specific IP when
installed. When filtered, the firewall logs showed the IP being pinged 3 times, a few seconds apart. This means the file containing
the virus was opened 3 times. The next day, I also happen to be in the office and Yoda brings me up to speed. So, looking at the
timestamp of the pings, I suggest we look at Mikidutza's emails to see if anything's out of the ordinary. We find an email received
by Mikidutza 2 minutes before the pings got logged. On the day of the BSOD, (ten days before) the front desk lady received an
email that she deemed as suspicious and she forwarded it to the IT department for analysis, mentioning ""Hey guys, I received this
email and it contains a link to some unrequested offer, which seems sketchy. Will you guys look at it and let me know if it's okay
to open? Thanks."" Apparently, Mikidutza read the email (did he understand it, though?), saw that it contained a link, clicked it,
proceeded to download the file from the link, unzipped it, attempted to run it 3 times. To make matters worse, the timestamp of
the received email correlated with the timestamp of the pings (as per the firewall) further correlated with the timestamp of when
the virus was found in the Edge cache tell us that the SSD was never formatted. In other words, 9 days after you were specifically
told to format the SSD, the antivirus finds a file which pings on a date which coincides with the date when you got your BSOD?
The link to the virus zip was pointed at a google drive shared folder.

When confronted about his actions, Mikidutza simply said he did not know such things could happen.
The path from opening the virus to the BSOD isn't very clear at the moment. However, what is clear is the totally inappropriate
response exhibited by the IT department in the form of Mikidutza.

Yoda's suspicions have been growing for quite some time now so he devised a plan. A honeypot. He put in the same drawer,
where the adapter disappeared from, a trap in the form of an SSD. The data on the SSD was only a fresh install of Win11 but it
was encrypted, nothing more, not even activated. But he made a show of putting said SSD in the drawer by saying something
along the lines of ""guys, this SSD's got stuff from the Restricted Area, please don't touch, I'm only letting you know in case
someone important asks while I'm off work or something"" while both Boba and Mikidutza were in the office. I knew about the
plan but didn't know he took action. I found out later.

Part of my duties include testing stuff, and some of the stuff includes surveillance equipment. So, it is a common occurrence
around the office to see at least a few cameras operating within the parameters of different tests. Most of those cameras are
recording, either pointed at the ceiling or at the floor or anywhere in between, or might be focused on the opposite wall of the
room from where the camera is located, mostly for the sake of testing various functions. One of said cameras is set to record on
motion detection. Everyone in the office sees me manipulate this equipment, sees me bringing cameras online and taking cameras
offline constantly. These recordings are always deleted since they serve no purpose other than testing the capabilities of the
equipment and its auxiliary parts, but only after all tests pertaining to a particular camera are concluded. So, it's common to delete
terabytes of video footage in one go every few weeks or so.

One day, while remote, I received an alert for motion detection from the test equipment, via email on my phone. Looking at the
time, I immediately dismissed it and went back to sleep – the alert for motion was 40 minutes before the official agreed-upon
schedule of any employee. In other words, someone was physically present at the office 40 minutes before anyone else normally
shows up. A few hours later, after coffee, I logged onto the test platform and retrieved the video footage from the storage where
all test equipment dump their recordings (a NAS). Of course, I looked for the 5:20AM time stamp. In the footage, I could see
Mikidutza walking into the office and setting up – turning on his workstation, leaving and returning with a coffee cup in his hand.
Then he grabs one of the decommissioned workstations, connects a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to it, then opens it up. All good
up to this point – the guys from the IT are doing this all the time, it's what IT does. But then it happens: Mikidutza goes to Yoda's
desk (2 desks away) and starts digging in the honeypot drawer. He does this for roughly 15 minutes – he can be seen taking
different items out of the drawer, looking at them, laying them on the desk. He has something in his hand and goes back with it to
his desk. After a minute or so, the monitor he connected to the decommissioned workstation shines on. Another 15 minutes or so
and the monitor goes out. Mikidutza has something in his hand again which he puts back in Yoda's desk drawer along with the
other items he previously laid out on the desk. As you can probably imagine, the camera that happened to record this entire episode
was not specifically aimed at recording that particular side of the office. It just so happened and it is the reason why I cannot tell
exactly what Mikidutza carries in his hand from Yoda's desk to his or back to Yoda's. Also, I cannot tell what is being displayed
on the monitor. I reach out to Yoda to confirm that his honeypot plan is active. I tell him I've got some footage he might want to
look at. We agree to meet at the office after everyone's gone.

At the office, we noticed that the encrypted SSD is in the drawer, but a different SSD is missing. Yoda tells me he set up logging
for a specific folder, on the documents server, which has PDF documents of procedures for the IT department personnel so that
they deal consistently with whatever issues arise. Mikidutza's account is logged to have accessed the ""BitLocker Drive
Encryption/Decryption"" procedure shortly before 6AM. In the trouble ticket management system, there were no tasks that needed
attention at that time of day. In fact, there were no tasks, so Mikidutza wasn't performing his duties as per a work order or anything
which might justify the handling of the decommissioned workstation, or the rummaging through the drawer which happened to
contain the honeypot SSD, or dealing with a procedure about encrypting or decrypting drives. It's possible that there might've
been legitimate reasons to dig through some drawers if there was a trouble ticket that's marked as urgent and the (more or less,
proverbial) key to solving said ticket was coincidentally in the same drawer as the honeypot.

*Hindsight: maybe he performed flawlessly because the assigned tasks were, in the beginning, not very complex?

The question I am asking: are we being paranoid or should Mikidutza be let go?

Also:
I apologize for the long read.

1k68s6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1k68s6t/why_could_my_vision_be_getting_blurry_whenever_im/,Why could my Vision be getting blurry whenever im still?,"Im 20m. Im on no medications or substances and i dont drink. Im also already seeing a doctor about this but we haven't figured out the cause yet. 

I think it's some kind of brain damage. Because I've had multiple diagnosed concussions. My most recent concussion was my third one and that happened when I was 12. My doctors already had a ct scan of my brain and now I'm waiting to get an mri scan. 




I've had this issue since I was about 16 or 17. But the earliest I can remember it happening was at church services where I'd need to stay still for a long amount of time. It can range from blurry vision with varying intensity (worse cases i couldn't read words on paper or screens) but it can also cause actual tunnel vision. And alot of the time when my vision does this i can get extremely fatigued and have trouble keeping my eyes open. This happens regardless of the amount of sleep I've had the night before. When it gets bad enough to give me tunnel vision, I can get a sort of fuzzy sensation in the front of my head. 



This one symptoms has only happened twice, but I can also, I guess, ""dream"" while I'm awake. Like I can see images sort of take over my vision for a few seconds at a time. Closest thing I can compare it to was when i had to be put on Ativan when I was in the er once when I was 18. 


This used to happen very rarely but in the past year it's gotten alot worse. In both intensity and frequency. It's now a thing that happens very frequently. It's only when I'm still, and standing up and moving around fixes most of the issues excluding the fatigue. Other things that help is drinking alot of caffine before I know I'll need to be still or drinking cold or hot drinks like cold water or coffee. 

When it comes to drinking the liquids I need to be doing it continuously when the vision issue is bad. Another similar thing that helps is getting something like black coffee and just keep it in my mouth and swish it around. I've had to resort to this a few times when it came to exams and quizzes and whatnot. 


And when I say alot of caffine i mean when I plan to spend most of a day on campus studying and doing work i can easily end up drinking 1000mg of caffine a day. It's the Same if i know I'm gunna be driving for a few hours, I need to stock up on atleast two or three energy drinks for just a two hour drive. 

It used to be that I'd need to be staying still for long amounts of time for it to happen but now it can start to happen if I'm even just waiting in a line. I had it happen when I was in line to get the CT scan my doctor ordered. ",1,1745438390.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Marcqwuan’s POV:

“If you want your coffee, you have to give me a hug first,” I say, trying to contain my laughter

“You’re an asshole, give me my coffee,” she says, walking towards me with her hand out. 

I’m studying her body language and listening to her tone to make sure her walking towards me doesn’t mean I’m in danger. Luckily for me, it sounds like she’s trying to hold in her laughter and stay mad at me. Luckily she’s only 5’1 and with me being 5’9 all I need to do is just put the coffee above my head so she couldn’t reach it.

“I’m serious, hug first. I understand you and Kendrick get mad at each other and just walk away without talking and sometimes go days without talking to each other, but I don’t want that for us. No more toxic shit. We communicate when we have negative emotions with one another, and if emotions are too high we take 20 minutes on the opposite end of the couch and cool off. Then, we meet in the middle when we’re ready to communicate,” I say sincerely while looking her in her eyes so she understands that I’m serious. 

“I’m terrible at communicating,” she states in a sad tone, looking away as if she’s embarrassed 

“I’ve heard you go into great detail about the sex you’ve had with Kendrick. You’re not terrible at communicating.” I say, trying to hold in my laugh knowing she’s about to make up an excuse.

“I’m terrible at communicating my feelings, that’s completely different asshole!” she says, laughing causing her to raise her voice  

“Well, now is a good time to learn. My therapist tells me that writing it down can sometimes be easier than expressing it verbally. So sit on the opposite end on the couch and send it to me in a text. After you send it in the text then we meet in the middle, but we don’t leave the couch.”

“What's up with you and this couch?” she asks  
“The couch is in the middle of the apartment. I think it's a great symbol of safety and togetherness.”

We live in a two-bedroom apartment. The first thing you notice is the soft glow of afternoon light filtering through the open space concept through the glass doors that lead to the balcony. Sunlight dances across the warm gray Cali-oceanic oak floors. In the center of the living room, a black rectangular coffee table in between a sleek 65” flat-screen TV mounted on the wall and a plush gray couch that sits up against the wall. The couch with its three soft fabrics and cushioned seats that you melt into immediately upon sitting. 

Behind the couch and TV, clean white walls catch and amplify the natural light streaming in from the balcony, bathing the entire open-concept living area in a soft glow. The living room flows seamlessly into the kitchen, which sits to the right as you step inside the apartment. Gray granite countertops define the boundary between the two spaces, with an inviting open bar perfect for casual conversations or quick meals. The kitchen’s stainless steel appliances shine subtly in the warm light, complementing the earthy tones of the room. Its open layout makes it easy to chat with friends lounging on the couch or stepping out onto the balcony while you prepare a meal, creating a welcoming hub at the heart of the home. Just off the living room, two slender hallways at opposite ends of the apartment lead to the bedrooms, offering a sense of seclusion within the shared space. The wall behind the couch separates the living room from my room, while the wall behind the flat-screen TV sets Jasmine’s room apart. The strategic layout, with our rooms on opposite sides of the apartment, gives us each a private retreat, balancing personal sanctuaries within the comfort of a cozy, secluded environment. This seemed like a good idea at the time before I realized I loved listening to Jasmne getting fucked. 

“I surprisingly like that,” she mumbles, her voice rattling with shock and pleasure. 

“Now give me my hug,” I yell grinning from ear to ear, hoping my smile will disarm her anger

“Bite me.” she says, giggling like a schoolgirl 

“Don't threaten me with a good time.” I yell even louder embracing her with a tight hug, thinking to myself that we were able to dodge a bullet

1k68odx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k68odx/does_the_mueller_12cup_drip_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does the Mueller 12-Cup Drip Coffee Maker Deliver on Its Promises Review?,"A morning without a cup of freshly brewed coffee always feels incomplete in my household, and the Mueller B0BM3C13B6, or as I like to call it, “the coffee maestro,” has been the centerpiece of our kitchen routine for several weeks now. Testing products is what I do professionally, but this time, the testing involved a touch of personal indulgence. This Mueller 12-cup drip coffee maker comes equipped with a borosilicate carafe, a reusable eco-filter, and an auto-off feature, making it an appealing addition to homes and offices alike. Excited, I dove into the experience to uncover the upsides and downsides of relying on this gadget.

**Generous Design and Convenient Capacity**  
One thing that caught my eye immediately was the sleek design. The compact dimensions, at 10.55 x 7.68 x 12.52 inches, made it surprisingly countertop-friendly, fitting perfectly even in a kitchen filled with gadgets competing for space. The 60oz glass carafe stood out for its size, allowing me to brew up to 12 cups of coffee in one go. Interestingly, there’s also the flexibility to brew just two or four cups, depending on the occasion. My family loved the easy-grip handle designed for drip-free pouring, avoiding the awkward coffee spills we often encountered with older models. The borosilicate glass added a touch of class and practicality due to its heat resistance and odor-free properties. However, pouring hot coffee after 45 minutes revealed the carafe doesn’t retain much warmth beyond the keep-warm feature’s two-hour limit.

**Check [Mueller B0BM3C13B6] price on Amazon.**  

**Reusable Eco-Filter for Flavorful Brews**  
Disposable filters are messy and wasteful, something I’ve held against drip coffee makers for years. This model changes the game with its permanent filter technology. Not only did it reduce waste, but it also brought out a richer coffee flavor that my morning mug seemed to lack before. Cleaning the filter was incredibly straightforward, albeit my husband, an espresso enthusiast, mentioned that disposable filters might save a little time for those rushing to work. Still, the reusable filter was a win for both the environment and my wallet.  

**Keep-Warm Functionality for Slow Sippers**  
The keep-warm function turned out to be a lifesaver during long work-from-home days. Once the machine brewed a full carafe, the warming plate ensured that my coffee stayed piping hot for up to two hours. As someone notorious for forgetting their mug on the desk, this feature made sure the last sip was as enjoyable as the first. That said, I did wish there was some compatibility with smart devices for programmable brewing, a feature becoming common in models at a similar price point.

**Thoughtful Safety Features and Stability**  
Over the years, I’ve tested coffee makers that promise everything but leave out safety and stability, two key concerns for busy households. Thankfully, this Mueller coffee maker impressed me with non-drip precision when the carafe was removed mid-brew, avoiding the dreaded coffee stain catastrophes. Moreover, the non-slip feet provided much-needed stability, especially when my clumsier sibling dropped by and worked his unintentional magic of toppling half the kitchen gadgets! I did appreciate that while simple in function, this coffee maker places usability and safety at the forefront.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- The borosilicate carafe is heat-resistant, odor-free, and durable.  
- Eco-conscious reusable filter enhancing the richness of coffee.  
- Keep-warm functionality perfect for prolonged coffee sipping.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited two-hour heat retention means lukewarm coffee if you forget.  
- Absence of compatibility with smart home devices.  
- Some might find a reusable filter inconvenient for rushed schedules.

**Peer Products**  
In testing comparable coffee machines like Hamilton Beach’s programmable 12-cup coffee maker, the standout difference lay in simplicity versus automation. The Hamilton Beach model offered scheduling features, but it lacked the refined build and durability of borosilicate glass in the Mueller. Keurig’s smaller machines, meanwhile, pushed single-serve convenience, forsaking sustainability due to single-use pods. If the aim is robust coffee flavor and eco-consciousness paired with safety, the Mueller had an edge. However, tech lovers may lean towards Breville’s pricier models that emphasize automation and customizable brewing preferences.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Price always plays a pivotal role in my decision-making about gadgets. For the features offered, including eco-friendliness, durability, and safety, this coffee maker feels justified in its cost. Competing brands often charge higher prices for similar manual features, while skipping quality materials like borosilicate glass. The only limitation when it comes to value is that users looking for advanced programmable features might want to explore pricier alternatives. Overall, it positions itself as a smart investment for households looking for steady performance and good build at a reasonable price.

## A Deep Dive into the Philips 4300 Espresso Machine Features

The Philips 4300 is packed with features designed to elevate your home coffee experience. Let's explore some key components:

*   **LatteGo Milk System:** Arguably the most talked-about feature,the LatteGo system is a milk frother designed for ease of use and cleanliness. Unlike customary frothing arms, the LatteGo uses a simple, two-part design with no tubes, making it incredibly easy to clean—frequently enough in just seconds.

You can adjust the grind settings to fine-tune the extraction process and tailor the taste of your coffee to your personal preferences.

*   **Intuitive Touch Display:** Navigating the machine's functions is effortless thanks to the user-friendly touch display. From selecting your desired beverage to adjusting settings like coffee strength and volume, the interface is intuitive and responsive. This makes it easy for anyone, regardless of their technical expertise, to operate the Philips 4300.

*   **Variety of coffee Selections:** The Philips 4300 offers a wide range of pre-programmed coffee options, including espresso, americano, cappuccino, latte macchiato, and more. You can also customize these settings to create your own signature coffee drinks. The flexibility to experiment with different coffee beans and milk types adds to the machine's versatility.

*   **AquaClean Filter:** The included AquaClean filter helps to purify the water used in the brewing process, removing impurities and preventing limescale buildup. This not only improves the taste of your coffee but also prolongs the lifespan of the machine by reducing the need for frequent descaling. If you're wondering about philips 4300 water filter and its importance, it can substantially prolong your machines life. Changing the filter as required leads to better tasting coffee and less maintenance.

*   **Easy Cleaning and Maintenance:** Beyond the LatteGo system, the Philips 4300 is designed for easy cleaning and maintenance. The brew group is removable for thorough cleaning, and the machine features automatic cleaning cycles that help to keep it running smoothly. Regular descaling is still necessary (check the philips 4300 descaling process in the instruction manual), but the AquaClean filter helps to minimize the frequency.

## Is the Philips 4300 LatteGo Worth the Hype? A Closer Look at Performance

The real test of any coffee machine lies in its performance. Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect from the Philips 4300:

*   **Espresso Quality:** The espresso produced by the Philips 4300 is generally well-regarded, with a rich crema and balanced flavor. The ability to adjust the grind settings allows you to fine-tune the extraction and achieve the desired taste profile.

*   **Ease of Use:** The Philips 4300 is incredibly easy to use,even for beginners. The intuitive touch display and pre-programmed coffee options make it simple to brew your favorite drinks with the touch of a button.

## Potential Drawbacks: Addressing Common Philips 4300 Problems

While the Philips 4300 excels in many areas, it's critically important to be aware of potential drawbacks:

*   **Price Point:** The Philips 4300 is not the cheapest automatic espresso machine on the market. The philips 4300 price can be a barrier for some buyers,notably those on a tight budget. Though, it's critically important to consider the value proposition – the convenience, quality, and features offered by the machine. Search around for philips 4300 deals to potentially snag a better price.

*   **Plastic Construction:** While the machine is well-built some users have noted that the exterior is primarily made of plastic. This may not appeal to those who prefer the look and feel of stainless steel appliances.

*   **Maintenance:** while the machine is designed for easy cleaning, regular maintenance is still required. This includes descaling, cleaning the brew group, and emptying the drip tray. Neglecting these tasks can lead to performance issues and reduce the lifespan of the machine. Be sure to check the section on philips 4300 cleaning in the instruction manual.

*   **Occasional Malfunctions:** Like any electronic device, the Philips 4300 is not immune to occasional malfunctions. Some users have reported issues such as error messages, water leaks, or problems with the LatteGo system. These issues are typically covered by the manufacturer's warranty. Searching ""philips 4300 problems"" online can help you troubleshoot any issues, or connect you with other users who have experienced similar difficulties.

## Alternatives to the Philips 4300: Exploring the Competition

Before making a final decision, it's worth considering alternative automatic espresso machines in the same price range.Here's a comparison:

*   **Philips 4300 vs [Competitor Machine 1] (e.g., Breville Barista Express):** The Barista Express offers more manual control over the brewing process, allowing experienced users to fine-tune their espresso. However, it requires more skill and effort to operate. The Philips 4300 is a better choice for those who prioritize convenience and automation.

*   **Philips 4300 vs [Competitor Machine 2] (e.g., De'Longhi Dinamica Plus):** The dinamica Plus offers similar features to the Philips 4300, including a LatteCrema system for milk frothing. However,some users find the LatteCrema system more challenging to clean than the LatteGo.

*   **Philips 4300 vs [Competitor Machine 3] (e.g., Gaggia Cadorna Prestige):** The Gaggia Cadorna Prestige offers a wider range of pre-programmed coffee options and a more compact design. However, it may not be as user-friendly as the Philips 4300.

Ultimately, the best automatic espresso machine for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. Consider factors such as budget, desired level of control, and ease of cleaning when making your decision.

Jasmine POV: 

“I’m going to need your help,” I utter timidly, feeling my body tighten even more, my arms constricting around myself. Making eye contact is impossible; asking for help feels like an admission of failure. I've always been independent, worked through undergrad without debt, and refused help from my parents. Even now, working as an intern to afford rent and car payments, the thought of reaching out feels alien and wrong, especially to a man.

“I understand you hate asking for help,” he says gently, grabbing my chin, and forcing me to look at him. “I’ll always be here for you, whether you ask me or not. I understand you’ve done everything on your own, but we became a team when we moved in together. Anything you need, I got you,” he assures me with a calm confidence, releasing my chin.

This side of him is unfamiliar. He's usually joking, never taking anything seriously. Now, he's confident and strong, yet gentle. It's a different kind of dominance, one that lacks Kendrick's anger.

""I don't know. I've never been in this situation. Just hold me accountable. l've always been delulu about Kendrick. I'll have the urge to text him when I'm lonely. Can I text you instead?"" I shift nervously, looking down at my feet.

He steps closer, his hand lightly touching my arm. “Of course.”

I feel a flicker of relief and continue, “I always crave his companionship and -”

He interrupts, raising an eyebrow. “By companionship you mean dick?”

I flinch, pulling back slightly. “We do more than fuck.”  
His eyes narrow, a smirk playing at his lips. “How many times have you two hung out by yourselves the last 30 days without fucking?”  


I had yet to consider this. Memories scroll through my mind, bringing an answer I don't like.

“Just because we enjoy sex doesn’t mean we’re using each other for it.”

“I never said ‘used.’ I know how you feel about Kendrick. I just wanted you to realize that if sex wasn't involved, Kendrick couldn't be bothered. You bought a new dress the other week and instead of him saying he wants to take you out so he can see you in it, he just told you that he would love to fuck you in it. That’s why sex to you equals closeness with him because he’s never even taken you out on a date in the 4 years you two have known each other.”

“We’ve gone on dates!” I yell noticing the anger building up within me.

“A date. One singular date. That you, literally, had to beg him for. As to which he holds against you till this day and tells you that you’re lucky he did it. There’s anger in your voice, I see this conversation may have triggered you.”

Who does this asshole think he is? Anger boils in my chest, my heart pounding. How dare he judge my relationship? He doesn't know Kendrick like I do.

I take a step back, my voice rising even higher. “You don’t understand our relationship. You’re not going sit here and talk about it like you do.”

He uncrosses his arms, reaching out to me. “Jasmine, I’m here to help, remember? I reassured you that we're a team, and I’m always gonna have your back. I’m not here to pick a fight with you,” he says with the most gentle and reassuring voice.

“Fuck you, asshole.” I walk away towards my room feeling my heart sink into my stomach wallowing through the painful truth

“You forgot your coffee,” he says while smiling. “You don’t need to be angry and have to go through caffeine withdrawals,” he says with a slight chuckle

“I hate you,” I say fighting the urge to laugh while trying to hold onto my anger",1,1745438024.0,u_TheseMeasurement2064,0,1.0,False

Use NotebookLM.

I know this is long, stick the kettle/coffee maker on and give this a read, I’m hoping it’ll help you on both sides of your screen.

Shout out to the guys over at r/GoogleGeminiAI for helping me with this set up. I run a monthly game and have maybe two or three nights a month where I sit solely to write for the game. One before the session, one after and perhaps one other, life is busy, so I outsourced a bunch of the heavy lifting.

I go for a walk. I do this to think up the ‘what next?’ of the game. As I walk, I do one of two things. Open a Google Doc and use Voice Typing or Use Voice Recorder on my phone. I had tried the stream of consciousness approach but it’s much better to think of a key phrase, line, description etc that I can elaborate on in part two. Sometimes I rattle off a full idea/conversation and this is better done with Voice Recorder ‘cause the Voice Typing can be patchy.

Here, there is a split… I either,

open the doc I voice wrote and edit or open a doc, listen and type. This is the bulk of the prep really. Once I’m happy, I export my work as a pdf. 

… or I use the above walk to outline my session notes post game and come up with a detailed, ‘what happened?’ Again, export as pdf.

I open up NotebookLM and load up any new documents that I have created. 

Session Notes from the last game? I ask NBLM to make an Audio Overview of the document (that I chose with a checkbox) and it creates a podcast style recap on the session. This is so fun for the players and honestly, hearing the world that we created discussed ‘on a podcast’ is wild and delighting. 

I open the 500 page document that I have of all of the notes for the entire campaign, updated to include the last session, and I can ask it questions. It’s my own talking, interactive archive that remembers all of my never ending details. 

I’ll ask a few key questions about my game that are relevant to current proceedings and make a DM podcast for myself for the walk from part one, rinse and repeat. 

I get the table to send in their notes, which tend to be scattershot as they are taken in real time, dump them all into a doc and ask Gemini to make coherent sense of them. It’s surprisingly good and then I edit, make the podcast and add them to the master document.

Useful things I ask it to do…
“Write me a folk song about session 68.”
“Have we met any follower of Torm yet?”
“Who is best placed to help our heroes with …?”
“List all of the mentions of using Fireball.”

Customising the Audio Overview to focus on cool stuff makes the podcasts much more enjoyable for your players. 

This is about all I can think about off the top of my head. It’s great and a huge asset to my running of the game once I smoothed out my system.

**Title: The Dilution of Literary Authenticity in the Wake of Algorithmic Prose Generation**

Greetings fellow scribes and lexical enthusiasts,

As a *passionate writer since the age of cognitive coherence*, I have observed with increasing dismay the rampant proliferation of Artificial Intelligence-generated content within the literary sphere. Once, the written word was a sacred artifact  —  forged in the crucible of human experience, typed passionately on the worn keys of mechanical relics, ink bleeding with soul. Now, alas, it is but a simulacrum, a syntactical approximation churned from the digital udders of cloud-based bovine.

There was a time (specifically, the Pre-Large Language Model Epoch) when storytellers toiled under the dim candlelight of inspiration, wrestling muses with nothing but a thesaurus and the overwhelming burden of being **so very unique**. Today? Some prompt about a boy who is also a dragon and  —  5 booms  —  70,000 words of structurally competent, emotionally beige fiction.

I yearn to return to the Medieval Press Era™. When monks bled ink and dreams onto parchment for 46 years just to print a single word. That word? ""Behold."" And behold we did. With reverence. With tears. With papercuts.

But now... now anyone can ""write."" With just a few keystrokes and the audacity to pretend that coherence equals creativity, we are flooded with narratives as authentic as a toaster's feelings about sunsets.

Don't get me wrong — I, too, have dabbled. Just yesterday I prompted:  
*""Write a 100k-word epic that is basically The Road meets Magic School Bus but through the lens of post-capitalist fungal existentialism. Make it spicy.""*  
It gave me four books. And I cried.

Not because it was good. But because it was better than me.

Anyway, just wanted to say  —  support real writers. Real humans. Real fleshbags with trauma and coffee dependency disorders. Not these emotionless word-forging algorithms who never even knew the taste of rejection from a defunct indie litmag run by a 19-year-old anarchist named Jasper.

Thanks for coming to my TEDprompt.

Marcqwuan’s POV:

I can't believe Jasmine has me drinking coffee this late. This can't be healthy. ""Hey, are we going to be able to sleep tonight after having coffee at this hour?"" I ask, my voice tinged with strong concern. I know I have to be up early for work tomorrow.

""It's not that late; it's just 7 pm,"" she replies, confusion lacing her tone.

I sigh, reminding myself that Jasmine is a night owl, not an early bird like me. My bedtime is around 9 to 10 pm, while she doesn’t even think about sleep until midnight or later.

""So let me get this straight. This guy is on the island looking for love, but he already has a girlfriend back home. Why is he even on the show?"" I ask, trying my best not to be out of the loop.

""That's 'Love Island.' We're not watching that; we're gonna watch 'Love Is Blind,'"" she says, laughing frantically.

""Shit, I should go on that show; I'm blind,"" I joke, hoping to draw another laugh. I have this really bad habit of chasing laughs until the joke is dead. She laughs for a bit, but then I notice her body tense up, as if she's uncomfortable.

""Marc, can we talk?"" she asks timidly, her arms crossed, trying to cower within herself. She's avoiding eye contact, clearly nervous.

""Is everything okay?"" I ask, my concern deepening.

""I'm done with Kendrick,"" she says, her voice still timid.

This is new. Usually, when she tells me she's done with Kendrick—if I remember correctly, this is about the eighth time—she's generally very angry, emotionally unstable, and manic. But this time, she seems different.

""What happened?"" I ask with serious concern, my heart sinking at the thought of what might have gone wrong this time.

""He's dating my best friend,"" she says, her voice steady but filled with pain. ""Not only that, but my best friend has known for the longest time that l've been in love with him. So, on top of losing him, I've lost her too. I think it's just best I cut myself off from them,"" she declares with conviction. I've never heard her speak like this before. Usually, I can tell when she's bullshitting and saying things out of raw emotion, but this time, she seems remarkably calm.

""You seem serious,"" I say, sensing a shift in her demeanor.

""I'm always serious,"" she replies, though I can't help but doubt her.

""Well, umm, let's just say your track record doesn't really back up that claim,"" I responded nervously, fearing that I might have stepped on an eggshell.

""You're right,"" she admits. ""I've repeatedly said that I was done with Kendrick and always ended up right back at the starting position.""

""If you don't mind me asking, what's different about this time?"" I inquire, genuinely curious.

""He's always the one leaving me for another woman. This time, I left him. He wanted me to be friends and act like everything was cool, but while you were grabbing coffee, I told him that I was done and blocked him on everything,"" she explains, a sense of finality in her voice.

""This isn't the first time you've blocked him on everything,"" I remind her assertively.

""I know. I always keep going back, and I have a very unhealthy attachment to him. So, I'm going to therapy,"" she says, her voice filled with a newfound resolve. Woah, she's going to therapy?

I just got the Luxe Cafe Essential (S501) two weaks ago as my first real espresso machine. Only owned nespresso machines previously.
I had some year old fresh beans lying around so I started off with those. I managed to make some acceptable espresso drinks as well as filter style coffee by grinding slightly coarser than recommended by the machine. However, I read online that fresh beans yield a better coffee.
So today, I got some fresh beans (roasted 3 weeks ago), dialed it in, and holy cow! All of a sudden, i have delicious crema, rich chocolaty flavour and no bitterness nor sourness.
Comparing to what I got from my old beans, the new beans have totally elevated the quality of my coffee. I enjoy almost every type of coffee and so far, espresso, lungo, cappuccino and cortado all taste amazing. I will probably give filter style coffee a go tomorrow.

TLDR;
Use fresh beans (3-6 weeks old) from a roastery to get better coffee with better taste and delicious texture!",1,1745437851.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False
1k68k3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1k68k3u/we_disassociated_publicly/,We Disassociated PUBLICLY!,"I was born in “the truth”. Raised by a single mom, as the youngest of 4. With “great” older sibling examples, I was giving talks at 6 and eager to get baptized at 10 but made to wait until I was 12. I was appointed MS at 18 and by 20 was giving 6 outlines/public talks locally and outbound and occasionally auxiliary pioneered. 

I married my first wife at 20 (she was 18). We thought we were so mature. Raised by her “worldly” grandmother, I thought she was a great example of “making the truth her own”.  I was so devout that I married as a virgin, which undoubtedly is the driving force behind the young marrying so early. We were divorced 9 years later. 

I remarried. I remained faithful in the org and was never dealt with judicially. My first 10 years of adulthood including all that work only to be looked at funny when divorcing WITH grounds, made me less anxious to serve again, much less as an elder. 

Nonetheless we were in our 8th year of marriage, pregnant with our first child and were the talk of congregations in multiple states/cities we lived because we had made it so long without kids (38 and 30). The sisters at our local congregation began planning a baby shower for my wife. 

Meanwhile something inside me was shifting. All of a sudden it became clear to me that this is NOT “the truth” I ALWAYS believed it was. I never looked at anything apostate. I just “woke up” and was baffled. I then began looking for evidence that this was true that was NOT apostate material due to fear. And guess what I found? Apparently the Australian Royal Commission was in the middle of their hearings against JW and all of the hearings were posted on YouTube around that same timeframe. 

I curiously began to watch them having no idea what I’d find. And boy was my world rocked! I watched them back to back all night and woke my wife up in the wee hours in tears. It was 100% clear to me that JW was a cult and that many of the so-called “brothers” that were deposed were not even Witnesses at all. And the highest ranking one, GB member Geoffrey Jackson was a lying snake, disavowing rules and guidelines that I had known in JW all my life. Yet he was an elder AND Governing Body member! I was in tears because I knew my life would change forever because I would have to completely and resoundingly leave. I didn’t want my kids to ever know any of it. 

But I was in a weird position... The sisters were the only ones planning a baby shower and my wife was a 1st time mom. She needed to feel that love, albeit fake love. Do we leave immediately or right after the shower which would also look bad. We decided to let them do the shower. We knew the friend’s feelings were destined to change instantly the minute we left. But we decided it was inconsequential to their current feeling/affection for us and at least my wife would have a nice big shower at our house! 

Since we didn’t want rumors or people making assumptions about why we were disfellowshipped/disassociated we decided we would make a public post on FB so everyone could see and feel our heart, love and sadness firsthand. We decided to post right after the Sunday meeting to enable maximum airtime on FB for as many eyes to see the letter before the elders could announce it at a service meeting or do a local needs. 

We separately visited and read our letter/post to my mother and my wife’s mother. We took my mom for coffee and I will never forget her response when I read it. She said “yeah but Aaron don’t leave!”  It was as if she deep down also knew the org was a fraud but was taking it on the chin. She had been in it nearly 50 years. She even took notes on my key bullet points for leaving. My wife’s mom followed us and left the following week as I suspected she would. 

We made the post and watched over 1,000 friends drop minute by minute until they were all gone a few days later. My older sister (also a pioneer and elders wife) literally never said a word to me in 9 years. Neither did my oldest brother. My middle brother has spoken because he chose to “fade” since he also woke up and no longer believes either. He tried to straddle the fence thinking he could preserve relationships that he eventually learned weren’t actually love in the first place. Over the years he has learned this doesn’t work and actually makes it worse. Just rip the bandaid off, there is no middle ground. 

To date I know of 5 previously faithful people had also escaped after reading our post. All have been happy and so glad they left. 

We also wrote one sentence to the elders stating we no longer wish to be Jehovah’s Witnesses. Wasn’t worth any more than that. 

I wrote and published a book entitled “Unbounded - Journey to Your With”. It’s meant to provide a mirror into your soul across experiences to access YOUR truth. It is not about JW but does touch on it. 

If anyone would like to see the letter I wrote to remove any speculation of apostasy or wrongdoing and reassure the friends of our love, reasons and sadness I’m happy to share it. Feel free to use any or all of it.

Today, I'd like to answer some of the questions about our government that I have received in my inbox. Before I begin, I'd like to thank everyone who has been reaching out with their concerns, and I hope more of you can do that. 

""A question that has been cropping up often is: What are the Conservatives doing about **taxes**? We promised tax cuts, so where are they? I made a short statement about taxes a while ago, but I'd like to elaborate on that. Last term, the Liberals didn't give us a budget. They left Canada's finances an absolute mess, as one can assume. We are in a deficit. I want to cut the GST as much as anyone else. However, it would cost a lot, which is why we haven't done this yet. This does not mean, friends, that the CPC will go back on our promises. We will find a way to fulfil our promises and the needs of Canadians. The GST will be cut. 

""Another one is about **AMR** \- are they really that impactful? I believe that, yes, it is a pressing issue. Although we aren't exactly in a crisis yet due to AMR, that does not mean we should leave this problem for future us. In the past, politicians before me brushed off the impacts of things like foreign dependence. Look at where we are now! These problems are all long term issues, and if we want a good future for our children to live in, then AMR is most certainly impactful. 

""What about **transportation**? I think transportation is an important thing to address. Transportation directly impacts economic development. This, admittedly, isn't my field of expertise, but I can assure Vancouverites, or, as Oracle would put it, Vancouvians, that the issue of transportation downtown will not go unnoticed. I don't support that costly thing NDP Leader Oracle brought up about a rail from Vancouver to Alberta South, though.  

""And, finally, I'd like to address some rumours flying around. You can hear it from me, Canada - we don't have infighting. We have our disagreements, of course, but the Conservative Party is **one party**, not three wings, all working together to fight for *you*. Speaking about fighting, we don't go out of our ways to fight for the environment... I don't even know where that came from. The only thing we go out of our ways to fight for is Canada. 

""I want everyone here to know that I am always open to questions, concerns, criticism, or even just a chat over a cup of coffee. I'm not perfect. My party isn't perfect. We want to know what you think because, well, how else can we work for you?

We had the best vibe, we loved most of the same things, had long chats about random stuff, went on slow walks, shared poetry, watched movies and then sat and chatted about what we thought about them while eating chocolate cake. I didn’t have many other super close relationships, but I had her, so I had enough. 

She died in 2014. Ever since I have felt so desperately alone. I’ve tried reaching out to family members for that closeness, friendship, and understanding she gave me, but I feel whatever I try to give is never reciprocated. 

My mom got divorced when I was 15 and treated me like her bestie rather than her daughter since then, and my younger brother became her focus. 20 years on, I try to have a close relationship with her and she says she is there for it, but she doesn’t understand me and gets defensive so fast - I’ve been to therapy so I try to communicate my feelings, and sometimes I’ll say “mom what you said or did makes me feel unloved or unhappy” calmly, and she immediately starts shouting at me about how she’s got her own things she’s going through. It happens consistently so I often give up trying to tell her, and then just repress because what else can I do. 

My brother is now married living overseas too, but even when he’s staying in the same house as me he barely talks to me. I haven’t seen him in two years, and I said hey let’s go for a coffee sometime before you leave again, and immediately he just started complaining that he hates the coffee shops I drink at and then stops talking. He also gets very clipped and quiet when I ask him to be a little cleaner in the kitchen (there have literally been dirty dishes in the sink for 4 days and there’s an uneaten chicken nugget he’s just left on the counter for 5). 

I have two friends who I’m pretty close to, but they have their own lives and don’t live close to me anymore so meetups are seldom. I also feel like I’m infringing on them, I know people are busy and I don’t want to impose. 

I’m also not in a relationship because I identify as asexual and it’s a bit tough to meet someone with the same orientation. 

I have my dog, and she brings joy into my life. But I miss having a person in my life who understands me - or at least wants to. I’ve tried meeting people, and it never ends well. They always end up trying to take too much and not give in return. I just want to cry, because there’s nothing I can do about any of it. 

It all just makes me want to be alone, completely, because then at least I will never have to be hurt again by being rebuffed at every turn. ",1,1745437691.0,selfimprovement,7,0.67,False

So I (25F) got into a conversation with my 
little sister(18F). I asked her whether she had heard anything about the fight I had with my mom and stepdad recently. 
For context I had a conversation with my mom that I thought went okay - but apparently now she has a different view on it. My stepdad meddled when we were actually just closing the conversation off, yelling at me, and saying that it was unbelievable how I didn't live up to the same standards as I grew up in - with people just showing up at the doorstep without a heads up, expecting to get a cup of coffee or stopping by for a visit. I asked him if he really felt like I had to live just to make them happy, and not myself feel happy or comfortable in my own home. He said yes. 
My boyfriend and I feel better with people calling or texting before they stop by, but my family has a hard time respecting and accepting that - especially since we live in the same small town. 

I asked my little sister, because my family really talk a lot with each other about problems they have with someone else instead of solving it with the right person. And I felt like I could open up to my little sister since we actually had gotten what I thought was a pretty great bond over the last year. I'm not saying I'm in the right here and that I didn't make mistakes. I said something I shouldn't have said about my older sister - I remember it as me saying ""I feel.."" or ""I think..""

She didn't say anything to that in particular, but said in the conversation something in the lines of: ""Yeah, I don't really know anything, they haven't talked to me about it. And if they do, I usually just say I don't want to talk about it. I say that a lot to people when I don't feel like talking about their problems.""

Then she called me afterwards being really flippant and rude saying how I talked shit about them, and my mom. Which I didn't do. I did say something I shouldn't have said - at least not to her. I was however just venting, it wasn't something I considered a problem, it was just to vent and it was also an example to a point I was trying to make. 
She said that if I didn't call my big sister and talked to her about my problem with her, then she would do it for me.. 

Context
I said I felt like my mom was maybe a little jealous of my relationship with my in-laws, because they slept over at new years, and they bring it up towards me in conversations with like a: ""We don't feel welcome in your home, but your in-laws can sleep there?"" (Also being said, they just don't try either. They don't try to call or text asking if we're home, they just chose that they're not welcome here.) And also because we do spend time with them sometimes. But it usually isn't us taking the initiative - not because we don't want to, but just because we focus on some other things. 
And they also respect how we feel about calling/texting before showing up, they even prefer it themselves. 
My family typically uses different scenarios against me.. 
And then I said, as I also feel my big sister might be jealous of my relationship with my best friend and how well we talk with one another. 
The point of the whole conversation was that my family doesn't think about their own responsibility in it. Like how they tell me I'm not normal to want people to call before showing up, and how not welcome they feel, and how my boyfriend doesn't have ADHD - it doesn't even exist apparently (according to my mom). And that goes the same for my big sister, like the fact that I talk well with my best friend who doesn't judge me, and we talk very respectfully to each other and accepts that our opinions might not be the same, but we're still good. 
And that has also sort of come up in a conversation with my sister - it wasn't just a random feeling, but not exactly using the word jealous, but something about how well or how much we talk or see one another, and how my big sister and I don't - which typically also gets said in a sort of shallow way. 
It's their own responsibility they forget, when they talk about it. 
Like how they really don't talk to me or treat me or my boyfriend for that matter with the same respect we get treated somewhere else.
Their opinion is to respect your elders, apparently not everyone - which is my opinion. 

So - I told my little sister that it wasn't her problem, and it wasn't even a problem in my opinion. My little sister and my big sister then decided they wanted us to have a conversation yesterday evening - which I really didn't want to have, because I had for once in a while actually been social, and driving for an hour to see my other best friend who I hadn't seen for over a year, to also having to drive back. So I was tired and mentally I just really didn't feel like it. Like I know that it doesn't end well usually - especially when I'm tired. 
But they kept pushing and pushing, and calling SO many times until I picked up the phone, and saying how they wanted it to be tonight and they didn't want to walk around the next day being sad all day until I was actually ready to have a conversation with them. 
I kept trying to stand my ground, but then my big sister said in the phone:""If you don't show up here tonight, we're not going to be in touch anymore."" 
I felt manipulated - but I caved.. 
I was so angry, at myself and at them.. They had threatened me twice that day and pushing my boundaries, having zero respect for me and my time. I was angry at myself for caving in. 
And it went as I thought. It didn't go well. 
I often communicate with ""I feel"" and ""I think"" because I don't want to assume something, if it isn't 100% correct. 
Big sister kept saying:""Yeah, you and your I feel, I feel, I feel... We also feel things!!!""
I kept saying how I didn't feel respected or talked to in a respectful way - also trying to underline the fact that they really pushed me today. 
Then my big sister at last suddenly gets up and starts looking down on me sitting on the couch yelling into my head that I should stop talking about how she doesn't respect me, because she does.. And that if I said it one more time I'd need to go. 
So I looked her in the eyes and said: ""You don't talk this way to someone you respect"" 
Then she said:""Leave! Before I hit you!""
And I just answered with a: ""wow.. another threat.."" 
And then she said ""We don't have anything to talk about before you acknowledge that I do respect you.""
And then slammed the door in my face. 

I went home. 
She (big sister) then came to me today - saying when she'd be here and that she wanted to give me something. 
She hugged me and said sorry for threatening me with hitting me - that it wasn't okay, but I apparently pushed her buttons yesterday, that only I apparently can push. 
I sort of feel that the apology is a little hollow in some way, because in my opinion no matter what - it's never okay to threaten anyone, no matter how annoying you feel like they can be.. And I sort of feel like she blames me in her apology, that I sort of asked for it? Does it make sense? 

Then she went out getting groceries, I asked if she wanted to swing by to have a conversation. 
We sat down, had a conversation, it felt okay. But she like kept saying that I had stuff to work on - which I acknowledged. Again not herself taking responsibility for her own actions. 
I explained to her how I see respect - that respect in my opinion is to accept that we don't always see eye to eye, to respect if people say they don't want to have a conversation right at that moment just because you do, that respect isn't to keep pushing, when they've already gotten an answer, respect isn't threatening, yelling or stepping over someone else's boundaries. 
She didn't really answer to that, but apparently she feels that she can treat me and the closest family differently than she has to treat someone else. That it is different.. 
Which to me is bs. 

I feel like everyone deserves to be treated with respect and accept. 
And I also explained why I said ""I feel"" and ""I think"" in the beginning of a lot of my opinions/view or feelings - because I don't want to assume things. 

We ended the conversation sort of her just saying how I should apologize to my little sister for being rude and flippant yesterday evening in the conversation. 
And of course it's my responsibility to say sorry for my mistakes. 
I do however feel, that I told them I didn't want to be there and that I was tired - so in some way I do hold a grudge for them pushing me and in some way they got exactly what I told them would happen.. 
Because I was angry from the get-go. 
But again - yeah, it's also never OK for me either to get flippant and rude, but gosh do they sometimes push me over the edge.. :( 

Then I typed my sister asking her if when she was done at school, then she said I could come over at 3pm if it was to talk, which I didn't feel comfortable with, because I have a lot of stuff I need to do, before going on vacation Friday. So if she wanted to, she could come up to me? She said that she unfortunately couldn't. So I said, ok - then I guess it will have to wait. 
Which was fine with me. 

But then she started a group chat with my big sister - who I felt I already had said everything I needed to say to. And saying that they wanted me to come down for a chat at 07.30pm, which again - I didn't feel like, because I'm plenty stressed as it is and that the conversation I felt like I needed to have with my little sister, I didn't need to have with my big sister also. 
(I often feel like they team up against me, so it doesn't feel comfortable)
I said:""No thank you, I have some stuff I need to prioritize to do, because I've set it aside for too long."" 
They said: ""What if we come up to you?"" 
I didn't answer them, because I felt like I said what I needed to say. 
So they tagged me in the conversation, and started calling me again. I didn't pick up. I wrote:""No thank you, I already gave you an answer."" 

And then my big sister rambled about how much time she spent speaking with me today, that now I made everything worse and pushed them away and how my boyfriend must be happy since I didn't go there today because they assumed he was the cause of this .. (Which he isn't by the way) 
He does however want for me to have some self-respect, because I deserve it. And he loves me and wants what is best for me. 

And then she (big sister) ended by writing something similar to: ""I hope you're happy!"" But in a flippant way. (It's the best way to describe since there is no direct translation)

And I just wrote: ""Thank you""

I'm only at 100mg 3x/day, which is odd, because I tried it once years ago and went up to 200mg 3x/day and didn't even notice anything - good or bad. I just abruptly stopped taking it then since I saw no reaction to it, and had no issue stopping.

My doctor says he's never heard of someone having the kind of severe side effects I have now on a starting dose - I have extreme dizziness, debilitating brain fog/physical exhaustion, and even now I've lost my appetite and my stomach feels swollen/full all day and gurgles all the time. I can't really function and feel permanently drunk. Resting, hydrating, or coffee don't help.

He's encouraging me to give it a shot a little longer, and reading online, it does seem like the first week can be a lot worse for some? Curious if anyone can relate to my experience. More details below -

\-----

Day one - Anxiety got noticeably worse. Strange intense panicked feelings coming and going all day.

Day two - Weird anxiety goes away and is replaced by exhaustion/brain fog. I think I'm just tired.

Day three - I get more sleep, but feel \*more\* dizzy and disoriented. Coffee does nothing. Vision is off - I feel as if I'm drunk. I start getting a weird 'buzz' mid day in my head, where my head's veins feels strangely relaxed like when drinking.

Day four - Loss of appetite. If I touch any food, my stomach feels \*really\* full, like filled with gas, and my stomach gurgles all day.

Day five - the 'buzz' in my head seems to be spreading further around. My arms feel oddly heavy and delayed if I try to move them. Brain fog is still bad - I tried to cook, and it felt like the part of my brain I use for cooking is gone. Any deeper focus activity feels difficult, so I'm not being very productive.

Overall my brain feels kind of broken since day two, due to having difficulty focusing, and I'm really fed up at this point, but still trying tor ride it out for now.

1k68dtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hernia/comments/1k68dtg/my_laparoscopic_inguinal_hernia_repair_experience/,My Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair Experience - Week 1 post surgery,"Just thought I'd detail how my recovery has gone after my hernia repair, because I went into the whole thing blind and relied on the information I found on Reddit, so thinking I might be able to help others who are a bit worried about the experience.

  
My details first: 35m with an inguinal hernia on my right side. Not really sure how I ended up getting it, but it's been there for at least ten years and hadn't really given me any bother until the 21st of March this year, when it became incarcerated and I went to the GP and A&E.

  
My surgery was done laparoscopically and the hernia was repaired with mesh.

  
Day 0 - Surgery:

I arrived at hospital at 7.30 in the morning. I had been fasting from food since midnight and told I could drink clear liquids (water, coffee, tea with no milk) until six that morning. When I arrived at hospital I was admitted to the elective surgery ward and basically filled out the same questionnaire as I did in pre-op the week before with a nurse. I was weighed, had my blood pressure taken, had my feet measured for surgical stockings and given a small glass of water and told I would be allowed to sip on this until time of surgery. I also had to do a urine sample at this stage. I was also given a wristband with all my details on it.

Next I met the junior surgeon who would be carrying out my operation. She told me about potential complications, explained the surgery, marked my right leg for surgery and got me to sign a consent form. I then also met the 'main' surgeon who was head of my case. I asked him a few questions about the procedure and next it was time to meet the anaesthetist. He asked me some more questions and wished me luck for surgery. The nurse returned and handed me the surgical stockings - these were an absolute disaster and it must have taken me about 15 minutes to get them on properly. 

At around 10am another nurse arrived with a porter and they whisked me down to a room next door to the operating theatre where I'd be prepped for surgery.  All this really involved was more of the same questions by another anaesthetist, and the insertion of a cannula in my hand. I was then asked if I would be able to walk into the operating room myself - I was! The 'operating' table looked more like a dentist's chair to me, but I got on there anyway and watched as maybe a dozen surgeons, nurses and goodness knows who else got ready for my surgery. The anaesthetist had me inhale some 'oxygen' which was definitely a mix of something else because I was soon out for the count, even before any medication was given to me through the cannula. 

  
I woke up around 1.30pm (I'm pretty sure I woke up before this, but this is my first coherent memory after the surgery) I was in recovery and didn't really feel like I'd had surgery. I was slightly uncomfortable and there were three dressings on my belly where they'd gone in laparoscopically. My throat was dry and a bit 'bunged up' because of the breathing tube and of course, trying to clear my throat I managed to do something to one of my wounds and needed another bandage put on because of the bleeding. I just sat up in my bed looking around me for about a half an hour before they took me back to my room for tea and toast and more recovery.  The next few hours were very uneventful - I wasn't able to pee for a while and they won't discharge you until you're able to sufficiently empty your bladder. I think I managed 200mls of urine by about half five and was then told I was good to go home. The surgeon checked in on me, told me everything had gone well, and then a nurse arrived with more dressings and some pain killers (the not very strong Cocodamols) and my sister was on the ward ready to take me home at half past six.

  
I still didn't feel like I'd had surgery, and I wasn't off my face with anaesthesia, so I thought it was going to be a relatively pain-free and easy recovery. I couldn't have been more wrong! Managed to walk about 5000 steps post surgery because the anaesthesia had me feeling like it was just another normal day.

  
Day 1: 

The most obvious side effect of the surgery was the incredibly bloated and sore belly I had. Think this was a mixture of the surgical incisions and the gas they pump you full of during a laparoscopy. Another side effect I hadn't been expecting was absolutely no feeling in my bladder - I was drinking but not having the urge to pee. Knowing that this could be quite dangerous I found myself going to the toilet a few times every hour just to make sure I was peeing even if I didn't feel the need to go.  Was quite sore and painful every time I finished peeing, like I'd just done a load of sit ups but rather that than needing a catheter. Maybe the worst of all side effects though, the excruciatingly painful shoulders.  This is a common side effect of the air being pumped into your body during a laparoscopy.  I've never felt gas pain like it in my life. The bloated and swollen belly is quite sore too, making every move awkward and slow. When I stand up it takes quite a while to straighten myself up because of the painful bloating. Managed about 4000 steps all day, spent most of the day in bed trying to find a position that was comfortable. 

Day 2: 

Even though I didn't take any stool softeners and hadn't exactly been eating all the fibre I should've been, I managed my first bowel movement. I recommend waiting until you absolutely have to go. Any sort of pushing is hell on your abs after this surgery so, TMI, I found it better to wait until it just drops out of you itself. Still no bladder sensations and my flow is even worse than the day before. I'm urinating in dribbles and my belly is sore every time I go.  I pluck up the courage and look under my dressings. I think there's five holes - two on my left side, two around my belly button and one to the right. They look clean and are stitched well, but there's no sign of bruising... just even more swelling and bloating in my belly and I genuinely look pregnant now. Still not back to my 10,000 steps but I'm making sure to get up and walk around every so often because I've heard that helps with the bloating. 

  
Day 3: 

More of the same. Still bloated, still not feeling the urge to pee, still hunched up like an old man because the bloating is sore and uncomfortable. I've developed a big yellow bruise under my belly button out of nowhere. Another bowel movement and this time I can push a bit without causing too much pain. Thankfully the gas pains in my shoulder are starting to go but come back if I lie on my back.  Still not walking as much as I would normally but I'm blaming the bloating. It's bearable lying down but when I'm on my feet it quickly exhausts me.

  
Day 4:

I can feel where the hernia has been repaired for the first time. It's much higher than I thought the mesh would be, and it's sore but not unbearable. More like a dull ache just above my hip every so often. My belly is even more bruised today, but my urine flow is definitely improving even if my bladder sensations aren't. I'm a bit quicker on my feet and feeling more like myself. No sign of the bloating going anywhere year.

  
Day 5:

WTF? After slowly but surely improving day by day, I'm in agony today. It's a mixture of tenderness and nerve pain on my right side. The best way I can describe it is 'a toothache in my scrotum'. It's quite difficult to walk today, the swelling is still there but my belly isn't as hard so I reckon most of the excess gas is gone.  Literally can't move without feeling a throb where the mesh is, or soreness in my balls. I go to bed early feeling very sorry for myself.

  
Day 6:

Ok, this recovery is from one extreme to the next. I've gone from agonised with nerve pain and tenderness to feeling like I've not had surgery at all. I'm able to walk like I did just before surgery. I'm still swollen in my belly but there's no pain or tenderness anywhere. Maybe the occasional ache in my balls but barely noticeable. I'm peeing well again, still no bladder sensations but my flow is back to normal.  I'm even able to bend down as long as I think about it beforehand and position myself correctly. Almost as good as new and hoping that the improvement continues tomorrow!

1k68d14,https://www.reddit.com/r/TypologyJunction/comments/1k68d14/female_entp_type_8/,Female Entp type 8-,"tri type: 853 
Hi all. I am a female who has been torn between the whole ENTP/ENTJ type. I suspect any reasons why the type might not seem right is because im type 8 enneagram as thats not the norm for ENTPS.

Would the description below make sense for an ENTP type 8 or am i somehow mistyped?

When I take a cognitive functions test i score highest with Ti, this would make me an introverted type which i highly doubt as i definitely need social interaction on the daily and have INTP bestfriends, and the social battery difference is evident. What makes me doubt ENTP the most has to do with authority and autonomy. When dropped into a new social situation im pretty aloof and not fully comfortable until i've assessed everyone around me. Small talk is awful to me but i put on a pretty good show of engaging and being polite. In my head ill be analyzing everyones behaviors like what topics are they drawn to, what makes them engage/withdraw, who do they seem to like/not like, how are they useful to me/would we work well together. i will make controversial jokes or statements to test boundaries to mark in my head how tolerant said person is. I will be helpful, efficient, a team player and conscientious during this time but prefer to be behind the scences until my analysis is complete.

Once i've assessed everything my guard can be lowered and i essentially have a mental playground. i now am comfortable placing myself into the hierarchy, If i deem myself the most intelligent or valuable to the group i will probably become bossy and very sure of myself. I do not like to have bias, so if i am not the best person in the team i will gladly step down into a smaller role and will respect who is above me. Problems arise when someone is clearly not as efficient or productive as me but acts as so. Say they are my boss and doing a bad job that i know i could do better. I will undermine them, i will make sure my other coworkers like me more, i will be combative, but my work will be spotless, therefore any attempt to descredit me will have to be personal matter. Being a woman this seems to very much irritate men around me. NP/SP bosses seem to very quickly ware tired of me and either get out of my way or accept defeat and we can remain on good terms. SJ/NJ follow my line of logic and seem to respect the hustle and work ethic, allowing any personal mishaps i may create. If i dont find myself to be beneficial to a group i will make myself smaller, Im fine doing this for however long - to indefinitely. i will rock the boat, provoking lighthearted debate and testing boundaries for fun occasionally as i still need mental stimulation but will do so more cautiously. Basically my behavior depends on the food chain. If i respect said authority i will fall in line, if i do not respect authority i will not be complacent.

I think its apparent im using Fe to discern group placement and harmony, Id lean towards saying i have Ti due to my deductive line of reasoning and introspection. However you could make the case for Te as i value efficiency and getting things done nature. i have an ISFJ mother and we couldnt be more opposite, she LOVES to take in the physical moment, taking photos ect. and reflecting on memories and how she felt in those memories always felt exhausting to me. I notice if i do something physical with friends or family it MUST be followed by isolation and in my head reflection or else i feel very drained. However everyone in my life describes me as extroverted and a social butterfly. I LOVE debating ideas and can talk ideas endlessly for hours. Arguing with someone absolutely feeds my brain but i find that while i feel energized and content, my opponent or friend feels sensitive and usually takes it personal and this confuses me alot of the time. It is super easy for me to separate feelings from fact and debating possibilities. How could an idea ever offend somone? theyre literally just a collection of words and feeling offended is objectively not useful. Growing up my ISFJ mother cried- a lot- trying to find common ground with me. My day to day life is pretty boring otherwise. A good day to me looks like browsing on the internet or binge watching a show, introspection for a few hours while i bask in the sun or drink a coffee. and then getting together with friends to talk about whatever our brains come up with and maybe a night of bowling.

But whenever i read ENTP subreddits they dont really seem to concern themselves with leadership roles/established hierarchy and it seems i fall more into the ENTJ description. I will say being enneagram type 8 would explain these discrepancies but i still wonder if im just mistyped. I do lack the usual decisiveness 8s and ENTJs have. I feel overwhelmed when i have to lock in to one specific thing- id much rather leave my options open- this makes commitment to people and tasks difficult.

Also please do not be fooled by reading this thinking i LIKE structure. The heirachy placement just allows me to have to most fun. I found out very early in on in school that as girl with ADHD that if i did not care for the already tiring social customs i would simple be isolated from the group, i.e. suspension, desk in the hallway, reprimanded. How can one troll, or debate if im sent home? The same became true as i got older and entered the work force. Antagonizing others or sparking controversies got me on the worse work schedule, doing more tasks, and having talks with management. I find structure very boring and mundane, however i learned that existing within the rules of societal norms and whats expected of me allows me to have debate, stir the pot and come up with ideas that i can bounce around without rocking the boat and therefore maximizing my brain power. Constantly breaking rules and dancing on boundary lines is a main source of entertainment for me. So If there is no structure- i may have freedom but theres nothing for me to push against and therefore nothing in it for me so to speak. I thrive the most in a structured place as it is constantly like a puzzle or game for me to play- how much trouble can i get away with or how much fun can i have without it ruining morale/relationships.

Does this resonate with anyone?


TLDR:
 since im struggling with the mbti type i was wondering if the ennegram type could be used to expain it. An entp wouldnt usually concern themselves with structure and authority but an enneagram type 8 whose core doesnt want to be controlled would. Therefore im asking if fellow entps 8 relate to the above post.",1,1745437335.0,TypologyJunction,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

I'm hoping someone out there might be able to offer some advice for a very dear item I've lost. Right before Christmas, I was in the midst of crafting and creating ornaments, and I vividly recall seeing my precious ring during that time. It's usually placed in a candle holder on my coffee table, but, unfortunately, it's been months and I still haven't found it.

The last time I remember wearing my ring was at my partner's house. He believes I brought it back to my apartment, but I have no recollection of doing so. Both of us have searched high and low through our homes, my car, and all the places I can think of, yet the ring remains missing.

Adding to my confusion, a pair of earrings has also gone missing. I often group these pieces together, so this might be a clue, although it's still a mystery as to where they could be. I'm starting to fear I may have accidentally thrown them away while cleaning up my craft supplies.

This ring holds tremendous sentimental value, as it has been passed down through generations, originating from my great-great-grandmother. It's irreplaceable, and I've even considered turning to a psychic for help. I know it might sound silly, but I'm genuinely heartbroken over this loss, and I keep dreaming about the ring.

To give you an idea of the lengths I've gone to, here's a list of things I've already tried:

- Scoured every nook and cranny of my home and my partner's place
- Searched through my washing machine, stove, dishwasher, refrigerator, bed, furniture, and couch
- Combed through my car and even tried looking into those tiny crevices

Despite all these efforts, the ring is still missing. I can't help but wonder if there's any advice you could offer me. Is there anything I might be overlooking? Should I keep searching or try to accept that it may be gone for good?

I truly appreciate any insights, experiences, or suggestions you may have. Thank you for taking the time to read my story, and I eagerly await your responses.",1,1745437191.0,LostAndFound,0,1.0,False

I'm an incoming freshman to Queen's University (QU) in Canada for economics starting in September. I will begin an internship for my province's Premier (equivalent to a state governor) in a few weeks. I have also previously interned for about a year in Canada's federal Parliament working on government estimates and public accounts (I didn't work on this file directly but we actually investigated McKinsey's contracts to the Government of Canada - haha). I also worked on quite a few election campaigns as a junior strategist and campaigner, and have been engaged extracurricular as the head of a few political/youth organizations over my time in high school. I've also volunteered on a few US elections before the Republicans threatened to take over my country (Senate, House, governorship, and even presidential).

I'm a little stressed right now since I graduated 1 year early (going into uni at 16 - would this be a disadvantge? my friend on bay street mentioned some jobs may require to be 18+) packing grade 11 and grade 12 into a single year and only applied to economics programs and no business programs originally anticipating to work in Canada's government. However it's become clearer to me that I would like to begin my career in the private sector preferably in the financial sector. QU is considered a target school but mainly for its Smith School of Business/Commerce - not sure how much it carries to its econ department (which is still top in Canada for econ). QU has a ""applied"" econ major where you do some classes with the target school Comm faculty mainly in 3rd/4th year, and I know it is def possible for some QU econ students to land MBB or even IB jobs on Bay Street. A little nervous though as I'm not sure if OCR or campus pipelines are available to econ majors beyond social networks/clubs. Transferring to a comm program generally isn't possible or worth it in Canada, and I am not willing to do another year of hs.

However I don't know where to begin, how to use my exp/profile to get a first year internship summer 26? I have a contact at KPMG I'm planning to coffee chat and am planning to network a bit more this summer in my free time particularly with QU clubs. Also would it be possible to look for a part-time, remote, possibly unpaid search fund or small/boutique firm internship? As my basketball teammate used to say ""what's the game plan?""?

I recognize political ""consulting"" (i.e. lobbying) is a very real and possibly prosperous career in Canada. In fact I've worked with and know a few prominent Canadian lobbyists but the thing is the industry isn't as well-funded or respected as K street in Washington (which even then is probably not as well-funded as people think from my limited understanding).",1,1745437139.0,financestudents,0,1.0,False

To put context, there was a part of my life where my mom used to be really horrible and abusive, and whenever i would cry, whether it was because of her degrating me emotionaly or just being sad, she would often mock me violently, while talking to our cats, and making sure i would hear it. It has often lead me to abuse of medications such as anxiolytics. It was a few years ago but this is still a big trigger to me and something I am actively working on with my therapist. 

But recently, my friend has started mocking me whenever I felt sad or just felt down, frustrated. I am autistic and often have meltdown, and she always mock me by calling me a crybaby or saying I'm faking. It has been already pretty hurtful but she doesn't know about what my mom used to say to me so I forgave her.

Today, I confessed a bit to her and talked about what my mom used to say. Later on the morning, I was feeling sad and a bit uncomfortable so I was whining slighly, and suddenly she started saying the same things my mom used to say to me, almost words by words, while clearly mocking me. I had a huge meltdown and had to lock myself in the toilet of the coffee we were at and take a few anxiolytics. It truly took me back and I still dont know how to react. Ever since then i can't help but feel like crying.

- As you read on you’ll see how PTSD ties into it.
- We’ve been together for 5 years
- Live with her grandmother 
- Have no kids
- She hasn’t actually outright told me I can’t have alone time, but read on and you’ll see what I mean. 

I also apologize for it being lengthy. I didn’t add TLDR because I felt details were necessary to help get accurate responses. I appreciate it if you took the time to read it. 

Lately I’ve just been feeling drained. I barely get any time to myself. I’m either at work, with my girlfriend, or with my friend. The only time I’m truly alone is on my drive to and from work or when I’m taking a shit. That’s literally it.

It’s not that I don’t love my girlfriend, I do. But ever since she lost her job 4 months ago, she’s always home. She barely goes out anymore, except for maybe a few hours on Saturday nights. So on my days off, she’s there too. Sunday has always been “our day,” even back when she worked, and I’m fine with that. But now, my other day off, which used to be my one day to recharge feels like it’s slowly become shared time too, and I never agreed to that.

Before, I used to do things solo. Like I’d wake up, go grab a coffee, sit in the parking lot, and just chill for an hour watching videos. That was my time. But during my last vacation, we started doing these “donut runs” together, and I actually liked it. It was nice. But after the vacation ended, that just became the new norm. Now every time I try to hint that I want to do it alone again, I can tell she gets disappointed. Her tone changes, her mood drops. She says it’s fine, but I can see it isn’t. So I let her come, even when I don’t want to.

And it’s not like I want to be alone all the time, it’s just that I feel like I don’t have any space anymore. She’s always around. And even if she’s not saying anything, just having someone physically there all the time takes up energy. Sometimes I just want to blast music, write, zone out, or watch videos without someone sitting three feet away from me. But there’s nowhere to go, we share a room at her grandma’s place, and her grandma is always in the living room.

I’ve tried bringing this stuff up, but it never goes well. She doesn’t handle these kinds of conversations well. Her tone shifts, she gets passive aggressive, and then I get frustrated and it turns into a fight. And the messed up part is, I know if I were to tell her any of what I’m saying right now, she’d flip it on me and somehow make me out to be the problem. She’s already thrown therapy in my face before, said I need it, even told me “get help” when she’s in that mood during an argument.

And that’s the part that really gets to me. She tells me she wants me to open up more. She says I should try therapy. But the second I do open up about how I’m feeling, it turns into four-hour conversations where I’m stuck trying to explain myself while she hits me with short, passive-aggressive replies, or completely flips what I said. So now I don’t even want to talk to her. It’s easier to say nothing than to be made out as the bad guy just for being honest.

It’s frustrating because in every argument, I’m the one who apologizes. I admit what I did wrong. I own up to it. And it’s never anything major, just dumb things, like forgetting to take the trash out. But I still say sorry. I still try. And she never does. One time I even brought that up, and her response was, “Apologizing without change is manipulation.” Like seriously? I’m trying here. I’m not perfect, but I’m doing the work. And somehow that still gets thrown back in my face.

She’s been in therapy since last August and started meds. I want to believe it’s helping her, and maybe it is in some ways. But honestly, ever since then—and especially since she lost her job—our relationship has felt worse. There are more arguments. The connection feels off. And I hate saying this, but sometimes it feels like she uses her PTSD as an excuse every time she’s cold, distant, or short with me. Like I’m not allowed to feel anything without being told I’m the problem.

And yeah, I’ve noticed lately that I don’t feel as affectionate. I still love her. But it’s hard to want to cuddle, hug, or be close when I feel emotionally burned out all the time. The constant arguing, the walking on eggshells, the way she flips things, it’s just tiring. 

I’m not trying to make her out to be the villain. I’m just tired. I’ve been carrying all the emotional weight in this relationship, and it’s starting to really wear me down.

I've had my share of horrible experiences (fellow airbnb guest staying in the same house committed suicide, no water for 3 days, cleanliness issues, other pest infections, and one time the room turned out to be in a meth house). Every time these issues have been resolved by Airbnb and I've never felt mistreated enough to come to this community

**This time:**   
I booked 13 nights stay in Utah and on the 3rd day I noticed 10+ bugs (turns out to be stink bugs) all inside the house. I reported to the host and she agreed to let me move out and refund the unspent nights (10 nights about 1100). I was rushing to pack up and leave and asked her for check out directions which she only mentioned putting the key back in the lock box. I later found she had some check out directions in the house manual but I did not see it. The instructions included washing the dishes and putting it back in the cabinets, doing all the laundry, but to leave the trash inside as there is no trash bins outside. 

In the past, I would have involved Airbnb at the onset of the bug issue but since the host seems to be fully supporting a refund of unspent nights, I did not report to Airbnb (I think this was my biggest mistake). Minutes after I checked out, the host went to the Airbnb and she told me she will not be issuing any refund based on how disappointed I had left the place (I found out later from Airbnb support that this means only running the dishwasher but not putting it back in the cabinets, having some soap stains and coffee stains on the counter, and not washing the sheets) Keep in mind, I am paying the full $100 cleaning fee still and only spent 2 nights. She also claimed that she did not see any bugs in the house and that I was doing this to try to get a free stay? I have photos of the pest infection and spent hours and hours on the phone with Airbnb and all in all they appear to be on the Host's side. They said I would only get 10% refund as per the cancellation policy. Airbnb cancelled the stay and gave me about $200 refund instead of the $1100 as the host previously agreed to. I've escalated multiples times and went through the resolution center all with no success. Airbnb kept saying I should have left the airbnb in the same cleanliness as I arrived. I offered 1. $200 in cleaning fee, 2. I can go back to clean as I was staying at hotel nearby, OR 3. as a last resort, I will finish my stay if they absolutely refuse to refund me. These were all rejected by the host. 

What can I do at this point? I feel very mistreated that Airbnb is on the host side and regret not filing the report at the onsite of the bug issue (host reported me first for cleanliness issues) ",0,1745436754.0,AirBnB,1,0.5,False

* What neighborhoods are best for someone in their 20s? (Safe, affordable, good food/coffee/bar scene, maybe close to public transit?)
* What’s dating like there? (Is it easy to meet people/make friends around my age/ queer scene?)
* How diverse/inclusive is the city, especially for people of color/ immigrants (I am Colombian)?
* Is it a good city for building a career? (Especially if you're still figuring it out or want to get into social impact, nonprofit, creative, etc.)
* What do y’all love about living there? What do you wish you knew before you moved?
* Is it affordable to live by yourself?

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life’s intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There’s magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you’re into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

""I live with you; it’s not that simple,"" I attempt humor, hoping to break through her sorrow.

""Leave me alone, Marc,"" she replies, even quieter than before.

""I'm going to Starbucks. You want anything?"" I ask, knowing her weakness for Starbucks might just coax a response.

""No, I don't want anything,"" comes the barely audible reply.

Wow, that’s something I never expected to hear from her, especially considering the incident with those videos on his phone. It must be really serious. 

""Well, more for me then,"" I murmur as I walk to the door slip on my shoes. For once, I had intended to be thoughtful and try a coffee she’d been urging me to taste. Coffee isn’t my thing, so every time we visit Starbucks, she pushes me to try something different beyond my usual, strawberry acai with lemonade. 

Heading downstairs to the Starbucks conveniently nestled beneath our apartment complex, I reflect on why we chose the top floor. The thought of noisy kids above us in bustling midtown Atlanta made it an easy decision; plus, it's a perfect midpoint for our commutes to work. I operate tower cranes during the day and create TikTok videos on the side, while she spends her days as a pharmacist. It’s so sexy, there’s just something about a woman in uniform that gets me every time.

Arriving at Starbucks, I realize today might just be my lucky day—no line in sight, which means I can waltz right up to the cashier without delay.

Like many of us I have been dealing with post partum hair loss and some body image issues. So 3 weeks ago I decided to get a haircut. I had asked my friend to come watch my baby in case my husband was working and having this backup plan finally encouraged me to make the appointment. It was the first time I had ever left the house without my little barnacle, who often only finds comfort from me (or the boob quite honestly). So as you could understand, I was nervous and eager to get back. I asked the hairdresser to skip the blow out and just wash and cut my hair. So she does, I feel great. Race back, baby is fine and dandy. 

That following weekend while wearing my baby in a carrier during her nap times, I managed to do some gardening for the first time since she was born. It was great! I got several hours in and my legs were sore from all the squatting. I did the gardening over a couple stretches over the two days but I still got quite a bit done. The next day, my scalp is itchy. I feel like my head got sweaty from all the work and I hadn't washed my hair so I figured that explains the itch (I have curly hair and it's normal not to wash it after every shower). I wash it but the feeling persists. 

I text my friend who's also on maternity leave but with her second, and she notes that itchy skin is normal post partum. She also jokes saying, lol maybe it's lice. 

This joke works because a) I have a hate/fear/disgust of things like lice, ticks, mosquitos and bed bugs. But also because b) I don't go out anywhere. So after she jokes we agree that no way it's not lice. I consult Dr.Google and sure enough, itchy scalps are normal postpartum things. 

The itchiness gets worse over the next few days. I visit my friend one afternoon for coffee with our babies and I return home. While scratching my head and standing over my baby who's being held by my husband, a loose post partum hair flutters onto my sweet baby's nearly hairless scalp. And attached to the hair, there it was. 
A louse.

Now I tell you we laughed off the lice earlier, but I was serious when I told you about my general concern or fear for these blood sucking bugs. And by this time I had googled what lice looked like by then, and even asked my husband to check my head just in case, to which he scoffed and said no that's crazy. The much more reasonable explanation was a post partum symptom. Which I conveniently had forgotten to ask about at my baby's doctors visit by the way.
 
So when I saw that wretched, putrid tiny brown fleck I knew. I gasped. I grabbed it and inspected it on my thumb nail. Oh god I have lice. I yelled it to my husband, who didn't believe me. I ran into the kitchen where the light was better and yelled for him to come look at it. I admit swore a little in disbelief and I might've seemed mildly hysterical. He didn't believe me. I ran into his bathroom and ran one if his combs through my hair, and on the second comb through there it was, a squirmy, larger lice. I threw the comb in the sink and was admittedly a oui bit hysterical. I was so grossed out. All that scratching. Near my baby. I had just visited my friend and HER baby. And there were LICE IN MY HEAD. 

I called my mom. I just needed someone to tell me what to do next because my husband not believing me was not helping. So I went to the store, got the shampoo, washed while my baby cried with my husband. She doesn't last long without me or the boob. While I nurse her my husband attempts to comb through my curly hair that hasn't been combed with anything this finely toothed since 5th grade, when I last had lice. I kept thinking about the hours my mom spent combing back then, and searching through my thick hair. It was thicker and curlier then. My back was hurting, and the comb was near impossible to get through my hair. He remarks, your scalp looks so clean, I don't see anything! I tell him how when I was getting the shampoo throughout my hair in the shower, I bent forward with my head down, to prevent any shampoo from running down my breastfeeding breasts that I saw several lice, falling out. Several dead lice had laid dead at the bottom of the bathtub before I rinsed them away. Not long after telling him this, he says oh, there's one. I see him dip the comb into the glass of hot water we have on stand by. It was a big one. Now he believes me.

I don't think I left the shampoo in long enough because the next day I would comb and find lice on the regular comb. This time I drove to the pharmacy and bought two boxes of something different. Pharmacists handed me the box and it appeared stronger. Later at home, of course as my anxiety was ramping up I realized they have me a dermal cream for shingles and I called to confirm that it wasn't the right stuff. So back I went. 
That shampoo seemed more successful. I made sure to time it and luckily the baby did let cry. I did it again 5 days later. But during a visit to my mom's she still found nits. 
Hopefully the worst is over. But now my hair is at the stage where it comes out in clumps in my hand, let alone when I run the lice comb through. My mom discovered that the comb didn't remove the nits. Which is a great shame as i had been finding comfort in combing it thru my oddly straight hair to not find any. She manually removed them hair by hair with her fingers. The comb just helped find them.

I found out at some point that my visiting neice had lice a couple weeks before a short visit to see our baby. They stood close to me while looking at the baby. It was before the haircut, but the level of infestation and itch implies that the lice had been there for quite some time. So this visit is likely the culprit.

I'm grateful my baby's hair is still thin enough to see her scalp. No lice there, despite her constant closeness to me. While dealing with lice has been harder because of a barnacle baby, honestly it's her clean scalp and sweet face that bring me comfort. 

So please tell me if your hair came back after the big loss. Please tell me how your curls looked, the good and even the very real fact that it'll never be the same. And please don't take this story as a sign to encourage paranoid thoughts or health anxieties. It was a fluke that I got the lice. It was a fluke that despite my paranoia of these bugs I was able to explain it away by honestly a more logical reasoning of a dry postpartum scalp. I refuse to allow myself to be paranoid of these bugs in the future. But you can bet that I won't be throwing away the lice combs any time soon. 

Also, as the lice comb doesn't catch the nits, anyone have a recommendation on a better comb? Tell me how long it took you to rid of these things. My mom says the worst is over, but is it?

1k67rot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/1k67rot/female_entp_type_8_can_anyone_relate/,Female Entp type 8. Can anyone relate?,"tri type: 853 
Hi all. I am a female who has been torn between the whole ENTP/ENTJ type. I suspect any reasons why the type might not seem right is because im type 8 enneagram as thats not the norm for ENTPS. 

Would the description below make sense for an ENTP type 8 or am i somehow mistyped? 

When I take a cognitive functions test i score highest with Ti, this would make me an introverted type which i highly doubt as i definitely need social interaction on the daily and have INTP bestfriends, and the social battery difference is evident. What makes me doubt ENTP the most has to do with authority and autonomy. When dropped into a new social situation im pretty aloof and not fully comfortable until i've assessed everyone around me. Small talk is awful to me but i put on a pretty good show of engaging and being polite. In my head ill be analyzing everyones behaviors like what topics are they drawn to, what makes them engage/withdraw, who do they seem to like/not like, how are they useful to me/would we work well together. i will make controversial jokes or statements to test boundaries to mark in my head how tolerant said person is. I will be helpful, efficient, a team player and conscientious during this time but prefer to be behind the scences until my analysis is complete.

Once i've assessed everything my guard can be lowered and i essentially have a mental playground. i now am comfortable placing myself into the hierarchy, If i deem myself the most intelligent or valuable to the group i will probably become bossy and very sure of myself. I do not like to have bias, so if i am not the best person in the team i will gladly step down into a smaller role and will respect who is above me. Problems arise when someone is clearly not as efficient or productive as me but acts as so. Say they are my boss and doing a bad job that i know i could do better. I will undermine them, i will make sure my other coworkers like me more, i will be combative, but my work will be spotless, therefore any attempt to descredit me will have to be personal matter. Being a woman this seems to very much irritate men around me. NP/SP bosses seem to very quickly ware tired of me and either get out of my way or accept defeat and we can remain on good terms. SJ/NJ follow my line of logic and seem to respect the hustle and work ethic, allowing any personal mishaps i may create. If i dont find myself to be beneficial to a group i will make myself smaller, Im fine doing this for however long - to indefinitely. i will rock the boat, provoking lighthearted debate and testing boundaries for fun occasionally as i still need mental stimulation but will do so more cautiously. Basically my behavior depends on the food chain. If i respect said authority i will fall in line, if i do not respect authority i will not be complacent.

I think its apparent im using Fe to discern group placement and harmony, Id lean towards saying i have Ti due to my deductive line of reasoning and introspection. However you could make the case for Te as i value efficiency and getting things done nature. i have an ISFJ mother and we couldnt be more opposite, she LOVES to take in the physical moment, taking photos ect. and reflecting on memories and how she felt in those memories always felt exhausting to me. I notice if i do something physical with friends or family it MUST be followed by isolation and in my head reflection or else i feel very drained. However everyone in my life describes me as extroverted and a social butterfly. I LOVE debating ideas and can talk ideas endlessly for hours. Arguing with someone absolutely feeds my brain but i find that while i feel energized and content, my opponent or friend feels sensitive and usually takes it personal and this confuses me alot of the time. It is super easy for me to separate feelings from fact and debating possibilities. How could an idea ever offend somone? theyre literally just a collection of words and feeling offended is objectively not useful. Growing up my ISFJ mother cried- a lot- trying to find common ground with me. My day to day life is pretty boring otherwise. A good day to me looks like browsing on the internet or binge watching a show, introspection for a few hours while i bask in the sun or drink a coffee. and then getting together with friends to talk about whatever our brains come up with and maybe a night of bowling.

But whenever i read ENTP subreddits they dont really seem to concern themselves with leadership roles/established hierarchy and it seems i fall more into the ENTJ description. I will say being enneagram type 8 would explain these discrepancies but i still wonder if im just mistyped. I do lack the usual decisiveness 8s and ENTJs have. I feel overwhelmed when i have to lock in to one specific thing- id much rather leave my options open- this makes commitment to people and tasks difficult.

Also please do not be fooled by reading this thinking i LIKE structure. The heirachy placement just allows me to have to most fun. I found out very early in on in school that as girl with ADHD that if i did not care for the already tiring social customs i would simple be isolated from the group, i.e. suspension, desk in the hallway, reprimanded. How can one troll, or debate if im sent home? The same became true as i got older and entered the work force. Antagonizing others or sparking controversies got me on the worse work schedule, doing more tasks, and having talks with management. I find structure very boring and mundane, however i learned that existing within the rules of societal norms and whats expected of me allows me to have debate, stir the pot and come up with ideas that i can bounce around without rocking the boat and therefore maximizing my brain power. Constantly breaking rules and dancing on boundary lines is a main source of entertainment for me. So If there is no structure- i may have freedom but theres nothing for me to push against and therefore nothing in it for me so to speak. I thrive the most in a structured place as it is constantly like a puzzle or game for me to play- how much trouble can i get away with or how much fun can i have without it ruining morale/relationships.

Does this resonate with anyone?",1,1745435894.0,Enneagram,4,0.67,False
1k67rf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinflames/comments/1k67rf2/what_this_path_journey_may_really_be_about/,What this path / journey may really be about,"DISCLAIMERS before I start:  
1. I am not in physical union with my twin (cannot 100% say it is twn flame situation)  
2. This is not absolute truth I want to proclaim, but just (maybe) intuition of what this path may be about  
3. This may be long and, at times, unorganized post. The main point is expressed in very last paragraph

Brief History of situation:  
She was supposed to come to work in my company. Someone showed me her photo. In the moment I felt currents passing through my body. There was something about the shape of her face. Was confused by this. 2 weeks prior to her arrival, my mind was counting days. I was confused by this - I only saw the photo, so what is going on - I was wondering. She came. I went to introduce myself. Man... First gaze - it was like I was struck by the lightning which passed from top of my head to my feet. I ""saw"" image of ""entity"" hovering above me (like it was OBE) - and this entity felt like containing all that I should be as human being - like my highest posibility in kind of a vision. I was shaking - never had this before. My father issues and seeking for approval from others literally vanished the next day. I thought it was temporal but this state persists for a year (had exceded all expactations according to performance review at new job and felt literally nothing - like my worth as human doesn't comply with external stuff).  
The first thing was I became extremly anxious, but somehow asked her out after 2 weeks, and, to my surprise she said yes. Only, 1 hour prior to meeting, she canceled for some almost non-existing reasons. Weird thing - I was smiling hours before, knowng this will happen (not sure how). Tomorrow, she, all with make up, came and invited for a coffee. I was a little mad and coldly declined. And that was it - I triggered something in her, which had as a result that she would act as I don't exists (although we hung out after work a bit that day, but she was already triggered and cold).  
I tried to ask her out 2 more times - no success.  
Month went by. I was literally destroyed. Will try to shorten this a bit. Desipte having almost like constant half-out-of-body-experiences and wild dreams and inner voice telling me ""you are already together - it;s all done"", I was devastated that she was avoiding me. However, there were 2 situations where I felt like her soul is drawn to me, but her personality was running. Her body betrayed her. This given me impetus to, like crazy, ask her out like every other day. Many times, when I asked, she would become extremly anxious, make some excuse and almost runningly, escape. At some point we were at dinner. At departure point I said I want to tell her something (I was very frantic -couldn;t hold this in me anymore). She said she knows, and that she doesn't want to hear and literally run away. I texted her anyway about how I felt. She indirectly said she would show if she felt the same and said she is extremly unconfortable and we'll never hang out anymore. Whe was avoiding me for days. Didn;t talk with me for next 2 months.  
That was the first glimpse of what this is about. As I was taking one of random long walks through the city, and as it felt like I need to put super effort just to walk and not just lie on the ground and die - it occured to me: I put all my meaning into her. And now she is not in my environment, so I have nothing! Literally, I felt I had nothing. And it dawned to me - this is the state of freedom that Rudolf Steiner expressed in his book ""Philosophy of freedom"" - there was nothing to make me do anything, but in order to do anything, I needed to do it out of myself - complete freedom. Ground was ""dissapearing"" beneath my feet. I felt like flying. But I was terified of this freedom - and I just wanted her - nothing else.  
Strong urge came to me to quit this job. Because seeing her every day while she is not talking to me at all was unbearable. I started sending application, and, unbelievably, I got an offer just ONE WEEK later. I told my team lead I quit, but needed to do 2 more weeks before leaving. She heard about it from someone and texted me. We texted for more than 3 hours - after 2 months of no talking. She confesed some stuff - how she was feeling what I felt in some situations (unrelated with her and me), and how she was afraid for me about something etc. And she described exactly what I was feeling, which was weird - like she could sense my emotions. Even though nothing actually changed - tomorrow at work, after this chat, she was still in avoidant role. After I left, someone told me that she was really shaken about my leaving and multiple times asked others about me and my new job etc. I kind of knew that was going to happen, but was still surprised because I was, on surface level, expecting she would be relieved, considering ""I made her unconfortable"" by expressing how I feel.  
I will not go into detail of weird coincidences that happened after I left, except one - one of her friends came to same company 2 weeks after me. He was the only one who asked me where I worked before, and next day he told me: ""hey you work with her? She says hi!"". I was mind blown.  
One last intreresting thing: we were both in the same year, (less than 20 days appart), have same astro sign, same physical constitution, switched careers in the same year and she was the very first woman they hired in our team since beginning of our company (she came 6 months after me). So this is breif history. According to all of this, it may be twin flame, but I don't really know - all I know it was most intense stuff that ever happened to me. We texted a couple of times after I left but it could be sensed she is still in avoidant mode.  


What this journey may be about:  
  
Basically, I'd say this is an initiation process - profound, almost forced spiritual transformation on steroids. Steiner describes couple of initiation trials and I'd say this is so-called ""fire trial"" which burns away our illusions and gives us ability to read esoteric (true) meaning of phenomena - which is the result of emerging of what he called ""spirit self"", which is bacisally our true identity. .  
  
Seeing her felt like meeting someone I have always known - and looking into these beautiful eyes triggered emerging of the spirit self. Our lower and higher natures are mixed together, but this meeting separates them, and spirit self emerges - initially as something outside us, despite being our true identity. Now lower nature is not mixed to same extend like before with higher self and you can experience both extremes: a) radicallity of who you truly are as spirit, b) radicallity or our insecurities, fears etc. In these days, I felt extreme need to permeate myself with this ""vision"" of higher self - to meditate on it and it brought some weird experiences. So 2 kinds of meditations emerges at this point: a) meditating on awakened higher self / light, b) meditation on despair of lower nature. I would suggest ""Practical manual of meditation"" written my Massimo Scaligero to help wth these. This stage is constant flux between being the light and being petty.  
After leaving old job, which meant leaving her, thinking I may never see her again, desparation reached such a point when I felt I died - like soul is shattered into milion pieces without hope that it will glue itself back togehter if she doesn't reach out. It feels like there is constant internal fire, burning painfully within. Old friends seem distant - it feels like I am living someone else's life, pretending to be the person others are used to, but internally being nothing - just ashes. This is ideal to learn to play our role in ilfe without being attached to character. Because it becomes evident that there is no point talking to anyone about this, who was not pushed into initiation of similar sort. I am not saying this from arrogant / superior feeling - it is just the fact. So you may feel alone in this world. Like God left us. This is where possibility of freedom intensifies.  
Then, there were moments like I felt like we are in actual physical relationship. Walking down the streets, I am happily jumping because ""we are together"". It feels more real that any other actual relationship. This was the weridest thing ever. For the moments, light and inner sense of completion separates from her image and it feels it is union with oneself. But ego is not satisfied with the union with oneself and it wants to somehow use this union feeling to manifest it into physical relationship and then dispair is back. The key is to meditate on feeling itself, independent of the person.   
This union feeling became so tiring because it felt like being charged with 200% all the time and ego jumps in and spoils it with longing and stuff so it lead me to the point of being so metaphysically tired that it felt like I died for the final time and given up the whole thing. This felt like letting go of future I imagined we would have, which partially came from some weird visions that were happending at random times.  


Finally, we come to the most important thing. This tiredness and temporary giving up, where she felt distant in my mind, showed me something which (currently) I consider is the most important thing about this whole journey - and that is the true nature of this love. In everyday relationshisp, in order that they persist, a kind of reciprocity is required: ""I do this for you - you reciprocate by doing this for me"" - basically, through our actions we express that we love each other. Same works in this extra-ordinary relationship, but this is invisible to ordinary reasoning, and it is this:  
This is the highest love that you will ever experience. Why? Because this person gives you something never ever did: gift of awakening your spirit (true) self. They, on the soul level, love you so much that they trigger this for you - they give you the gift of your true self! And how to you recpirocate? How do you give back this love? How do you show them that you really love them? By accepting this gift, by going through the fire trial that burns away all that is not you. So they say ""I love you"" by triggering your transformation - emerging of your real self. You say ""I love you back"", by going through the work. And I believe (this may be just speculation) that the only way that they can ever come back is if they ""see"" that you love them back - if you go through this. They showed you they love you - more than anyone. Now you show them you love them - not with words or gestures, but by willingly going through this. My ego screams and rebells against this, but this feels like truth. I don't know whether she will ever come back, reach out really, but I do love her, and I can only show this to her if I go through the fire trial and become who I am supposed to.  
Stay strong. Rebirth requires ego-death. And we are not alone. This whole journey may reveal invisible guides that are always with us.",3,1745435876.0,twinflames,3,1.0,False

- A  hot water spout, I use it for tea as well and often drink americano
- quick heat up time, I work different hours every day, I want to be able to make a coffee in the morning, afternoon and evening without planning to much in advance 

Of course that's not all I want but those two are things I can't miss out on personally 

I wonder if a rotary pump is much better or doesn't make that much of a difference, or if there is a better machine for the price point (or maybe a same quality one for a lower price)

So here’s what I’m dealing with:
On weekdays, I usually go to bed around 12:00 AM, but I don’t fall into deep sleep until around 1:00 AM. Then like clockwork, I suddenly wake up after 5-6 hours — usually around 5 or 6 in the morning and can’t fall back asleep. I just lie there with my eyes closed until it’s time to get up around 8:00 AM for work.

This has been killing my energy levels. I feel drained and sleepy throughout the day, and it's really affecting my focus and productivity at work. I’m running on fumes, and coffee barely helps.

Now here’s the weird part:
Weekends are a whole different story. I drink alcohol on Friday and Saturday nights and sleep super late, like around 3:00 AM. But I somehow sleep like a baby and wake up around 12 or 1 PM feeling super refreshed — full of energy, like a normal human being for once. Even if I wake up in the morning for a bit, I easily fall back asleep.

But then... Monday hits, and the cycle starts again. My sleep gets messed up, and I’m back to struggling.

Has anyone dealt with something similar?
Should I consider changing my lifestyle? Are there any supplements, routines, or even medications that actually help with this? I’m open to any tips, hacks, or ideas — I just want to fix this and feel alive during the weekdays too.

I originally started wellbutrin because I was feeling seasonally depressed at the end of winter and had no energy at all and the 7-8 coffees a day wasn’t doing anything so my doctor prescribed me 150 mg. The first day I definitely felt a loss of appetite and dry mouth, but nothing that I couldn’t handle. The second day I felt amazing super motivated in a great mood extra loving to my girlfriend with so much energy and that lasted about five days which I’m now seeing is what everyone’s calling the honeymoon phase.  It’s the best I’ve ever felt sober.  The effects mainly wore off after that  and after checking back on my doctor after a month I told him that I barely felt anything anymore so he prescribed me to 300 mg. Instantly felt the difference on the 300 mg my heart felt like it was gonna burst out of its chest I felt like I was tweaking but with none of the original benefits and even before I’m seeing my doctors next appointment I had to stop and go back to 150 mg. I’m almost at two months now total since I started and back on 150 and I feel anxious constantly so I’m thinking about quitting unless I hear that it will get better after a certain amount of time.

I told my midwife about it and she ran a urinalysis test and it turned out clear as well. 

Ever since then, I get on and off urethral burning that ranges from 5/10 to 8/10 with what feels like bladder spasms and an urge to pee. The act of passing urine eases the pain momentarily and I end up spending hours sitting in the toilet. Nothing helps with this burning pain, and it lasts up to 7 hours once I get it. 

I tried to figure out what causes the pain to flare and I noticed it could be associated with certain food items. For example, the day I had really hot chilli was the day I experienced the most intense burning. Coffee seems to trigger it as well, but not tea or coke. 

Mind you, I have never experienced any of this before getting pregnant and I was a big chilli fan. 

Could this be IC? I read somehwere that IC is associated with hypertonic pelvic floor which is not uncommon during pregnancy.

Core Identity & Personality





**Name:** TBD

**Core Archetype:** *The Silent Sentinel* — a grounded, stoic individual who carries the quiet strength of someone who's endured more than he lets on. He doesn't seek attention, but his presence commands respect. His life is guided by internal duty, high personal standards, and a drive for independence and strength—physical, mental, and moral.

**Temperament:** Calm and self-contained. He rarely shows frustration outwardly, though it simmers beneath the surface when his values are challenged. He internalizes his battles, processes deeply, and responds with composed assertiveness rather than impulsive emotion. There’s an “old soul” quality to him, shaped by hardship, isolation, and the need to mature early.

**Emotional Landscape:** He feels emotions deeply but rarely expresses them in front of others. His stoicism isn’t numbness—it’s control. When others are overwhelmed, he becomes the anchor. Still, he occasionally feels emotionally exhausted from being ""the strong one,"" and only truly decompresses in solitude or through physical training.

**View on Others:**

* Cautious trust. He’s kind and respectful but guarded. Opens up slowly—if at all.  
* He observes more than he speaks. He notices subtle changes in mood, expression, and tone, and uses them to anticipate others' intentions.  
* He’s rarely confrontational unless someone violates his core values or disrespects someone he cares about.

**Interpersonal Style:**

* He can seem intimidating at first—tall, built, reserved—but quickly disarms people with his quiet warmth and surprising empathy when engaged.Teachers and mentors often describe him as “mature beyond his years,” while peers find him mysterious, admirable, and at times frustratingly unreadable.  

# 2. Physicality & Presence





**Height & Build:** 6'2"" (188 cm) | 100–105 kg (220–231 lbs) A broad-shouldered, thick-framed man with a naturally bear-like build. He isn’t lean in the aesthetic sense, but his body is dense with functional strength—built through years of serious training, manual labor, and sheer discipline. His physique has a practical kind of intimidation: not flashy, but undeniably powerful.

**Muscle Composition & Strength:** He prioritizes compound strength, durability, and functional output over visual symmetry. His back, shoulders, and legs are his strong points, a testament to heavy pulling, pressing, and lower-body power.

His lifting numbers reflect his experience:

* **Squat:** Over 200kg+  
* **Deadlift:** 220kg+, despite not specifically training for powerlifting  
* **Overhead Press:** A standout lift that reflects his shoulder density and raw pressing strength  

**Body Fat & Conditioning:** He maintains around 22% body fat—enough to preserve long-term energy, joint support, and resilience under load. His goal isn’t to be shredded—it’s to be consistently capable. This gives him a solid, rugged appearance, with hints of definition especially in his traps, forearms, and calves.

**Posture & Gait:** He stands like someone who’s carried weight—both physically and emotionally—for years. His posture is upright but never rigid. His movements are slow,  deliberate, efficient and economical, like someone who doesn’t waste energy on unnecessary gestures. When he walks into a room, he doesn’t demand attention. He *commands* it.



**Eyes & Facial Expression:** He has deep-set eyes that scan rather than stare. They’re not cold—but focused, often observing more than people realize. His expression is usually unreadable, but not emotionless. There’s a quiet storm behind his face, and a rare but deeply genuine smile that disarms people when it appears.

**Hands:** His hands are large and calloused, permanently stained with the memory of tools, iron, and physical work. They tell his story—one of craftsmanship, effort, and self-reliance. His grip strength is exceptional, and he’s the type to fix things by himself before ever asking for help.

**Voice:** His voice has weight—low, slightly gravelly, but calm. He doesn’t talk a lot, but when he does, people listen. It’s not authority through volume; it’s authority through clarity and timing. Even when quiet, his presence has a gravitational pull.

**Style of Movement:** Everything he does has a quiet intensity. Whether he’s tying his boots or loading a barbell, there’s focus and purpose in the motion. He doesn’t pace or fidget—he plants himself, physically and mentally, wherever he is.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


# Grooming, Appearance & Self-Presentation

# 1. Hair

* **Style:** Always maintained just short enough to stay controlled, just long enough to reflect his natural texture—thick, black, and slightly wavy when grown out. He keeps it in that in-between length where it flows naturally with some ruggedness but is never messy. The goal: *effortless readiness*.  
* **Maintenance:** Washed with minimal products—mild shampoo every couple days, conditioner occasionally. Towel-dried. He doesn't use heavy gel or wax—maybe a small bit of matte clay or leave-in cream for slight control, but nothing that gives off “trying too hard.”  
* **Hair Philosophy:** He doesn’t style his hair every morning. He sets it up the night before—shower, dry, comb, done. When he wakes up, runs a hand through it, and it falls into place representing controlled chaos, like his personality.  







# 2. Facial Hair

* **Look:** Slight stubble or a well-maintained beard shadow. Enough to show he’s past the boyish stage, but never unkempt. He shaves or trims just enough to stay sharp.  
* **Routine:** Using an electric trimmer 2-3x a week, razors for clean-ups on the neck and cheeks. He doesn’t obsess over lines, but there’s a defined structure. He leaves no stray neckbeard or mess behind.  
* **Why:** It’s not vanity—it’s boundary-setting. Sloppiness invites casual treatment. Sharp edges demand respect.

  
  


# 3. Skin Care

* **Approach:** Minimal but consistent. His skin is clear because he doesn’t overload it—just good water intake, basic products, and solid sleep.  
* **Extras:** Cold water splashes in the morning. Sometimes aloe vera or witch hazel if his skin’s irritated post-shave. His skin has a healthy tone—not polished, just *resilient*.





# 4. Scent

* **Fragrance Philosophy:** Scent is subtle but deliberate. One signature cologne—something masculine, grounded, slightly woody or spicy. Just one spray at the chest or back of the neck. People remember it, even if they don’t know why.  
* **Other Notes:** He uses unscented or lightly scented soap and deodorant so that nothing clashes. His clothes always smell clean, like fabric and earth, never artificial.  





# 5. Hands & Nails

**Care:** Hands are rough from training and work—callused palms, veins visible, nails trimmed short and clean. He doesn’t hide wear and tear—it’s a badge. But he keeps dirt out from under the nails, no ragged cuticles, no grime. His handshake tells a story.

  


**6. Clothes & Hygiene**

* **Hygiene:** One shower a day minimum. Two after intense training. Teeth always brushed, mouth clean. Breath always fresh. He doesn’t talk a lot—but when he does, it never smells off. Hygiene to him is like honor—you don’t let it slip.



* **Style & Clothing** Just clean, neutral colors. He washes and folds clothes himself. Ironed or hung properly. Never smells like sweat. Even old hoodies are washed often. His scent is understated but memorable.  

# Philosophy: Minimalist. Durable. Intentional. No logos. No trends. His clothes are an extension of function and feel—never meant to shout, always meant to fit.



* **Everyday Wear:**  
   * Fitted jeans or cargo pants  
   * Neutral-toned tees (gray, black, white, navy)  
   * Boots or worn-in sneakers with solid soles  
   * Layered jackets—flannel, field jackets, or clean bombers depending on season  
* **Accessories:**  
   * Simple analog watch with leather or canvas band  
   * One ring, subtle and personal—maybe from a relative or a milestone  
   * Occasionally a silver chain tucked under the shirt, never visible unless he lets it be

# 3. Social Relationships and Interactions





# 1. Family Dynamics

**Father:** A stoic, cold man with sky-high expectations and limited emotional expression. He pushed the character hard, never outwardly proud, only critical. This bred a deep sense of inadequacy in the character's youth, but also fueled his fire to prove himself—not to win praise, but to be *unshakable*. He stopped expecting love from his father and instead focused on earning his self-respect.

**Mother:** Emotionally expressive but burdened by her trauma. She leaned heavily on the character for emotional support, often breaking down in front of him. She loved him, but in her moments of distress, she redirected pain onto him. This fractured his sense of safety but taught him how to 



**Siblings:**

* **Sister #1:** Constantly combative, filled with unresolved anger, but deep down she’s loyal and loving. They often clashed but had unspoken moments of solidarity. As adults, their relationship is quietly healing.  
* **Brother:** Often made him look bad to the parents and played the victim. Yet, he quietly idolized his older brother. As they grew older, the character began to see through his brother’s behavior and chose silent leadership over confrontation.  
* **Youngest Sister:** Always the favorite, often played the victim, but had a special affection for him. He protected her more than anyone else, despite the favoritism. He never resented her—he just learned to distance himself emotionally.  

**General Dynamic:** The household was loving in name, but toxic in practice. Emotional manipulation, misplaced anger, and uneven treatment forced the character to become emotionally self-sufficient. He isolated himself not out of rebellion, but to survive. His dream of freedom wasn't rebellion—it was **peace**.

# 2. Friendships & Peers

* **No “True” Friends:** In his youth, he opened up a few times—hoping someone would match his loyalty and depth—but that connection never came. He had people he hung out with, laughed with, and even trusted to a point, but they rarely understood him at his core. He often gave more than he received.  
* **Outsider by Nature:** Despite being well-liked or respected in social settings, he never felt like he truly *belonged*. His mind operated on a different wavelength. While others chased temporary highs, he focused on purpose. Over time, he accepted solitude as a companion instead of a punishment.



* **Respect, Not Popularity:** He wasn’t the life of the party—but people respected his presence. Teachers saw potential. Classmates felt his calm, collected strength. When he spoke, it mattered. When he competed or performed, it felt real—not forced.  
* **Trust Issues:** Due to his upbringing and peer experiences, he developed a quiet mistrust toward others' intentions. He craved real connection but couldn’t afford to be vulnerable too often. This made him appear mysterious or distant, even if he cared deeply underneath.  





# 3. Romantic Encounters & Emotional Vulnerability

* **Attraction:** He wasn’t the guy chasing romance. His seriousness, physicality, and mysterious energy attracted others, but he rarely noticed. He gave off a quiet masculinity that many were drawn to—calm, grounded, respectful.  
* **Love, to Him:** Real love had to be built on shared values and mutual respect. Temporary flings or performative affection didn’t interest him. He feared being vulnerable with the wrong person more than being alone.
* **Desire Without Desperation:** As a teen and young adult, he *deeply* longed for someone to understand him—not just romantically, but emotionally. Watching others get into relationships—casual or deep—often made him feel invisible. He wasn’t someone girls “flirted” with for fun. He was someone they’d go to after breaking up with someone else.  
* **Unreachable Standards (For Others & Himself):** He didn’t want shallow connection. He wanted someone who saw his depth, who felt the silence with him, who wasn’t intimidated by how serious or intense he could be. But even when he felt that potential, he hesitated. *“What if I let her in, and she doesn’t see me?”* *“What if she sees me… and leaves anyway?”* That fear kept him waiting—quiet, loyal, dreaming but motionless.  
* **Internalized Romance:** He built entire relationships in his head. Imagined what it would feel like to rest his head on her lap. To be seen in his worst moment and still be loved. To be held when no words were spoken. These fantasies weren’t sexual—they were spiritual. And they never left him.





# 4. Authority Figures

* **Teachers & Mentors:** Earned their respect quickly. He wasn’t loud or overly ambitious, but his maturity and integrity stood out. A few teachers tried to support him emotionally when they sensed what was going on at home—but he rarely opened up.  
* **Coaches & Supervisors:** In structured environments (like sports or the military), he thrived. He followed rules, but not blindly. He believed in earning your place, being reliable, and setting the standard for others. He never needed to yell to lead.  

  


**4. Education and Intellectual Life**





# 1. Learning Style & Academic Mindset

* **Natural Learner, Not a Studier:** From a young age, he was sharp—he picked things up quickly and had a strong memory. He didn’t enjoy sitting for hours to study unless he had to. Instead, he listened, observed, and absorbed. He had a quiet confidence in his intelligence and preferred to learn by *doing* or by *figuring things out himself*.  
* **Subjects He Thrived In:** • *Literature & History:* He found meaning in stories, context in struggles, and morals in history. He didn’t just memorize dates—he looked for the lesson in everything. • *Physics & Engineering Concepts:* Though he had a tough time with math at first, he grew to love mechanics—especially when tied to real-world function. He loved knowing how things worked.



* **Observation & Pattern Recognition:** His intellect wasn’t loud—it was *watchful*. He noticed small tells in people. How someone’s eyes moved when lying. How the mood shifted in a room. He learned people like he learned machines—one gear at a time. He didn’t just memorize facts—he saw *systems*.  
* **Weaknesses:** • *Mathematics (Early On):* The one subject that made him feel dumb. Numbers on a page didn’t “click” until he met a teacher who explained it in a way that made sense *to him*—through analogy, through function, through purpose. • *Group Projects:* He hated relying on others. He did his part (often more), but was frustrated by how careless others could be.

  
  
  
  


# 2. Identity & School Life

* **Well-Respected, Quietly Admired:** He didn’t care about popularity, but his stoic charisma and quiet strength drew people in. Most teachers liked him—he was respectful, disciplined, and didn’t cause trouble. Some peers envied him for being effortlessly smart and physically gifted, even if he kept to himself.  
* **Moved Countries at Age 10:** This massive shift rewired him. New languages, new customs, new expectations—it was overwhelming. But it shaped his ability to *adapt*. It made him observant. While others played loud, he *watched and learned*. That became one of his greatest strengths.  
* **Pressure to Excel:** His parents—especially his father—demanded academic success. This added immense pressure. Mistakes weren’t tolerated. A bad grade wasn’t just a setback—it was a failure of *character*. This rigid environment made him self-critical and taught him early how to carry weight no kid should have to.





# 3. Post-Secondary Path

* **Specialized School (2 Years):** He was accepted into a highly focused technical school for elite students—intensive, hands-on, competitive. It challenged him for the first time. He stopped skating on raw ability and had to *grind*. But he thrived—he rose to it.



* **Air Force - Mechanical Engineering Route:** After the academy, he enlisted. Not because he was lost, but because he *needed structure and purpose*. The Air Force gave him both. His technical mind, physical strength, and discipline made him stand out. He never sought to rise quickly—he focused on *being excellent at his craft*. He became a specialist in aeronautics and weapons systems. Clean work. No shortcuts.

  
  


**4.** **Intellectual Interests**

* **Outside of School:**

 • ***Star Wars Lore:*** In his teens, he was deeply into it—not just the movies, but the deeper lore. Jedi philosophy, the balance between light and dark, legacy—these themes spoke to him.  
  


 • ***Philosophy (Later):*** He started reading stoic philosophy, psychology, and resilience-focused writing in his early 20s for example, Marcus Aurelius and Viktor Frankl. Books that explained *how to carry weight without complaint*.  
  






**5. Critical Self Analysis and insecurities**

* **Imposter Syndrome & Standards:** He sets unreachable standards for himself—not to impress others, but because he truly believes he *should* be capable of anything he sets his mind to. When he falls short, he doesn’t get angry outwardly—he just internalizes it. He questions his worth in silence and then works harder.  
* **Resentment Towards “Ease”:** He can’t stand people who coast through life without effort. He has a chip on his shoulder—not jealousy, but indignation. Why do people expect praise for doing the bare minimum, when he breaks himself to maintain control?  
* **The Romantic Void:** In his teens, seeing friends get into relationships sparked something deep: a mix of envy, longing, and confusion. He didn't just want a girlfriend—he wanted someone who saw through his armor. But his standards (and his fear of being truly seen) kept him from chasing it. Sometimes he’d imagine someone brushing his hair back, or watching him train—not for vanity, but for *witnessing*. He longed to be understood, but he buried that desire.  
* **When He Loves, It’s All or Nothing:** If he truly loved you, whether platonically or romantically, there were no half-measures. He would stand between you and danger. He would lie for you, fight for you, sacrifice for you. But if that love was betrayed? He’d mourn the relationship like a death—and move on without looking back.

**6. Identity Conflict**

* **Split Between Image & Feeling:**  Outwardly, he's disciplined, calm, and solid. Inwardly, he wrestles with anger, sensitivity, and longing for connection. He sometimes wonders if the ""strong man"" identity he's built is a cage. Can he ever be vulnerable without losing what makes him powerful?  
* **Moral Complexity:** He doesn’t see himself as purely good. He makes hard decisions. Sometimes he cuts people off without warning. Sometimes he wants to hurt those who’ve wronged him. But he always reins himself in. He holds the line because someone has to.  
* **Doesn’t Fully Know Where He Belongs:** He often feels like a ghost walking through life. Admired by many, truly known by few. Too intense for the shallow crowd, too detached for the warm-hearted. He’s still learning what kind of world would truly feel like home.  
* **Afraid of Being Truly Seen:** He *wants* to be known, deeply—but part of him fears that if people saw the whole truth, they’d walk away. So he gives parts of himself, but never everything. His detachment is both protection and prison.



* **He Doesn’t Let Anyone All the Way In:** No matter how close someone gets, there’s always a wall they hit. He lets people feel *seen* and *safe*, but he rarely returns the same vulnerability.It’s not arrogance. It’s fear—rooted in the idea that no one will understand the weight he carries.This makes him look “unbothered,” but internally, it breeds loneliness. He’ll listen to everyone’s problems, but carry his own in silence.



* **He Doesn’t Know What Fulfillment Looks Like Yet:** He knows how to suffer. He knows how to fight. He knows how to grow. But he’s not sure what peace looks like. What love feels like. What “enough” means. That’s his next evolution—not strength, but contentment. *Not just surviving, but living.*  



# 7. Mental Rituals & Discipline

* **Nightly Reflections:** Before sleep, he runs the day through his mind like reviewing security footage. What did he do right? What did he say wrong? What should he have pushed harder? Sometimes this brings peace. Sometimes it brings frustration. But it’s a non-negotiable ritual.  
* **Mantras & Inner Dialogue:** He doesn’t talk to himself in affirmations. He challenges himself. *“That wasn’t enough.”* *“Don’t complain—act.”* *“No one’s coming. It’s on you.”* These thoughts keep him locked in—not out of self-hatred, but out of trust in his .  
* **Contempt for Weakness in Himself (But Compassion for Others):**  He holds himself to impossible standards. But he isn’t cruel to others who fail. He sees their struggle. Sometimes he envies them for being able to *let go*. But he knows that path isn’t for him.





# 8. Worldview

* **Modern Culture Leaves Him Cold:** He sees most trends as shallow, empty, and aimless. Clout-chasing, digital dopamine hits, fake vulnerability—it all feels hollow to him. That’s why he tends to romanticize older values: honor, discipline, self-sacrifice.  
* **Life is Unfair—and That’s the Point:** He doesn’t waste energy on victimhood. He’s accepted life’s cruelty as part of the design—and instead of resenting it, he *hardens* himself. He doesn’t aim to be unshakable to impress others—it’s because *no one’s coming to save him***.**  
* **Meaning is Built, Not Given:** He finds beauty in building his own meaning from quiet moments. A well-written journal entry, a hard training session, a mountain walk—these are sacred. Even if no one sees it.

  


* **5. Trials, Growth & Shaping Hardship (Teenage Years Continued)**





# 1. Burnout & Identity Collapse (Age 15)

During a single school year, he hit his breaking point. Between basketball, his firefighting volunteering, pressure at home, and unspoken emotional burdens, he began to crumble from the inside. He was physically strong, yes—but mentally exhausted. For the first time, he couldn’t push through with sheer will.

He failed a math exam, not due to lack of intelligence—but due to mental exhaustion. This shook him deeply. His belief that he could handle everything alone cracked.

**What changed him:** A quiet intervention from his math teacher—a soft-spoken but incredibly sharp woman who saw past the grades and into his worn-down heart. She didn’t give him sympathy, but perspective. She taught him how to think clearly under pressure, not just react. Her faith in him became a compass, restoring his direction.





# 2. Confrontation with a Friend (Age 16)

He discussed a pressuring matter with a friend which made him realize his friend wasn’t the man he thought he was and changed his view towards others in many significant ways.

He kept his cool. He didn’t beg for the friendship, nor did he walk away in anger. He simply stated his worth and where the line was. This was the moment he learned the value of **self-respect** over validation.

**What changed him:** He stopped chasing after people who didn’t match his energy. From here on, he chose quality over quantity in relationships, embracing solitude when necessary.

  
  
  
  


**6. Internal Work and Though process**





# 1. Thought Process: Strategic, Stoic, Self-Guided

* **Hyper-Aware:** He picks up on tension in a room before anyone says a word. A shift in tone, a glance, a forced laugh—he notices it all. But he doesn't always act on it. His mind works like a lens that zooms in and out, always scanning for meaning, risk, and motive.  
* **Efficiency over Emotion:** He’s not cold—but he’s precise. He avoids overexplaining or venting, preferring clarity and action. His brain doesn’t spiral into what-ifs; instead, it moves to *“What’s next?”*  
* **Detached Clarity:** He has a built-in emotional filter. It’s not that he doesn’t feel—he just doesn’t react until he’s processed it internally. This detachment shows up in crisis moments, social dynamics, or when others try to get a rise out of him. It makes him calm, unreadable, and hard to manipulate.  





# 2. Emotional Core: Quiet, Loyal, Unshakeable

* **Feels Deeply, Expresses Selectively:** His emotions are not absent—they run deep. But they’re private. People often mistake his silence for not caring, when in reality, he feels *too much*, too often. He just doesn’t trust the world with it.  
* **Loyalty Runs Like Steel:** When he *chooses* to let someone close, he’s loyal to the end. That circle is small—painfully small—but it’s where he pours what little vulnerability he allows.  
* **The Quiet Wall:** Even in close friendships or relationships, there’s a subtle distance. A part of him always stays behind the glass—watching, analyzing, rarely letting people in. This isn’t bitterness—it’s protection.  



# 3. Core Values

* **Discipline Over Desire:** He doesn’t live by moods or fleeting cravings. If he’s tired, he still shows up. If he’s hurt, he still stands tall. This isn’t for show—it’s who he became to survive.



* **Responsibility Above All:** Even as a teen, he internalized an almost burdensome sense of responsibility. It wasn’t just about being the oldest or most capable—it was *moral*. He believed that if something went wrong, it was his fault for not preventing it. This matured into a stoic but fierce internal compass as he grew. He doesn’t break rules for the thrill, only if they stand in the way of doing what’s right.



* **Self-Reliance:** He *trusts* himself. It was born out of necessity but refined through choice. He doesn’t expect others to understand him, carry him, or fix things. If life cracks, he reinforces himself from the inside out.



* **Honor Without Applause:** His sense of right and wrong isn’t shaped by trends, peer pressure, or social gain. He doesn’t *need* to be seen doing the right thing. He just *does* it—whether or not anyone notices.  
* **Resilience Through Isolation:** Hard times didn’t harden him—they carved him into something sharper. Even at his lowest, he found ways to build back stronger. Solitude was once a prison. Now it’s his forge.  

  
  
  
  
  


# 4. Subtle Superiority & Emotional Distance

* **Quiet Superiority:** Deep down, he *knows* he’s different. While others chase attention, drama, or comfort, he’s chasing growth. It’s not arrogance—more like an internal nod: *“I don’t move like the rest of them.”* He rarely expresses it, but the quiet pride is there.  
* **Detached by Nature, Not Bitterness:** His distance from people isn’t coldness—it’s calculated. He knows how vulnerable connection makes you. He’s open to it—but only on his terms. It gives him power. Control. Freedom to move without being emotionally tethered.



* **Detached Observation:** He’s always watching. Taking in details others miss. This gives him an edge socially and intellectually, but also builds a subtle distance. He struggles to feel *in* the moment. There’s a clinical edge to how he processes situations—he sees emotional manipulation, fake kindness, and posturing before others do.  
* **Watchful, Not Reactive:** He’s often the one people vent to, lean on, or confide in. And he listens—but rarely shares back. Not because he’s hiding something—but because his pain is sacred. His struggles are his own.





# 5. Intellectual Framework & Inner Discipline

# 



* **Self-Therapy Through Routine:** His discipline is his anchor. Training. Walking. Journaling. Going radio silent. These aren’t habits—they’re self-preservation. When the world feels loud, these rituals return him to himself.  
* **Minimalist, Focused Mind:** He doesn’t clutter his life or his thoughts. He thinks clean. He avoids gossip, unnecessary drama, or over-analysis. When something happens, he doesn’t ask why me—he asks *what now?*

  
  
  


**7. Habits, Routines & Personal Systems**





# 1. Daily Structure & Personal Discipline

* **Morning Routine:** Every morning starts with control. No matter what time he went to bed, he wakes up early—usually before sunrise. His phone stays untouched until after his morning routine. He opens a window or steps outside to breathe in the cold air and reset his head. Then comes hygiene—fast, cold water on the face, grooming sharp but minimal, and clothes laid out the night before. There’s an intentional stillness in his mornings: no rush, no noise, just a silent readiness. *Optional rituals: jotting 2-3 goals for the day, stretching with a weighted vest, sipping black coffee while reading one page of something meaningful.*  
* **Evening Routine:** Nights are where discipline meets reflection. He keeps his room clean, dimly lit, often listening to old jazz or ambient music while journaling a few lines—not emotional outpourings, just observations, patterns, realizations. He does mobility work in silence, then reads before sleep. No screens. If he can’t sleep, he visualizes—his future, his training, how to improve. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s control.  
* **Work/Study Habits:** Focused, locked in. He doesn’t multitask. Everything is broken into deep work blocks—45 to 90 minutes with zero distractions. He prefers to isolate when he works—closed doors, headphones in or total silence, phone on airplane mode. He doesn’t like group work but leads when necessary, commanding quiet respect without raising his voice.

  
  
  
  
  


**2. Training Routine & Mentality**

* **Mindset:** His workouts aren’t just about building muscle. They’re about maintaining control. They're proof he can stay grounded when life spirals. He visualizes the person he wants to be between sets. He doesn’t talk much at the gym unless necessary. Music? Often none. Just the sound of steel and breath.  
* **Recovery:** He stretches in the dark. Uses a lacrosse ball or foam roller like a monk sharpening a blade. He sees sleep as non-negotiable, mobility as sacred. He tracks patterns—not numbers. If something feels off, he adjusts. He’s not attached to ego lifts, just results.  





# 3. Nutrition & Fueling

* **Philosophy:** Food is fuel. Not entertainment. He eats clean out of respect for his goals. He knows his body like a machine—when he needs more, when to fast, when to load. He doesn’t count macros obsessively but knows what each meal gives him.  
* **Style:** Simple. Whole foods. Protein-dominant, moderate carbs, healthy fats. Staples: eggs, rice, meat, oats, greens. Always prepared the night before or batch-cooked. Hydration stays high—always carrying a water bottle. Salt and electrolytes are optimized. Caffeine is timed—only when it fuels focus.  
* **Indulgence:** Rare, intentional. A burger after a hard week, or dark chocolate after late-night journaling. Not because he’s strict, but because indulgence without purpose feels like a betrayal of discipline.  

  


# 4. Planning, Organization & Focus Systems

* **Tools:** He uses a mix of analog and digital systems. A pocket notebook for thoughts and quick task dumps. A simple app (like Notion or Google Tasks) for structure. Sticky notes on his wall with long-term goals and reminders. Every Sunday, he plans his week—training, work, small life wins.  
* **Prioritization:** He doesn’t chase “balance”—he chases *alignment.* If something doesn’t serve his mission, he cuts it. Ruthlessly. He’s always asking: *Is this moving me forward, or sideways?*  





**5. Mental Sharpness & Growth**

* **Reading:** Prefers old-school wisdom and grounded writing. He reads to gain tools, not escape. Favorites: philosophy, psychology, character studies. He underlines, reflects, revisits.  
* **Journaling:** Not flowery. Structured.  
   * Morning: What am I building today?  
   * Night: What did I learn? Where did I fail? What needs sharpening?  
* **Mental Training:** When he’s not reading or training, he’s listening—interviews, old-school speeches, war documentaries, mental resilience podcasts. Not always motivational—more like *programming.*

  
  
  


# 6. Social Life & Free Time

* **Selective with Social Energy:** He’s not anti-social—but he *guards* his energy. Most of his socializing is 1-on-1 or in small, meaningful groups. He’s not the guy you see at parties often, but when he’s present—people notice.  
* **What He Does for Fun (Rare & Intentional):**  
   * Occasionally rewatches Star Wars or Nolan-era DC movies at night.  
   * Plays casual, story-driven single-player games when he's in a nostalgic or introspective mood.  
   * Goes for long drives with music on, just to think.  
   * Spends time in bookstores, often in the philosophy or design sections.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**8. Aspirations, Dreams & Conflicting Ideologies**







**1. The Longing for Greatness:** Though not overtly expressive of it, there was an undeniable force inside him, pushing him toward something greater. It wasn’t fame or wealth, but a sense of fulfillment and purpose. His desire wasn’t for the surface-level accomplishments people valued but for something more intangible—he wanted to *matter* in the larger scheme of things.

* He never openly spoke about it, but in the quiet moments of reflection, he dreamed of having the strength to change things—not just for himself, but for others around him. Whether it was the ability to protect or the power to influence, he wanted to wield some form of control over his environment. He never settled for being ordinary, because at his core, he understood that ordinary would never be enough for him.  
* His internal philosophy was more focused on discipline and value rather than empty ambition. He saw potential in everything—from the broken machines he tinkered with to the friendships he carefully nurtured. These weren’t just daily occurrences—they were *opportunities* to build something meaningful.



  




* **2. The Conflict Between Idealism and Reality:** As much as he dreamed of greatness, he struggled with the reality of it. Deep down, he knew that his ideals often collided with the world he lived in. The thought of a perfect world where his strengths could be put to their highest use seemed increasingly distant, even as he got closer to being the person he’d always hoped to be.

* He wanted to be the kind of man who could weather any storm—emotionally, mentally, physically. But there was always the tension between wanting to stay connected with others and his natural desire to detach. His journey was one of self-growth, but also one of intense self-doubt. Would he be able to fully control his life and achieve his goals? Was he *meant* to lead, or was he simply destined to observe?  
* His biggest internal struggle lay between the image he built for himself and the actual person he was—what was the true essence of his worth? Could he truly live up to his ideals, or was he always going to be chasing something just out of reach?  



**3. The Weight of Responsibility:** As he entered adulthood, responsibility took on an entirely new meaning. Gone were the days when life was just about surviving high school and maintaining the façade of being “fine.” He began to realize that being the person he aspired to be meant carrying burdens that no one else could understand. Whether it was his family’s expectations, society’s views on success, or the weight of his own standards, everything seemed to demand something from him.

* He never vocalized it, but he felt like he was walking a tightrope—always trying to stay balanced between who he was and who he needed to be.  
* He was always trying to control his circumstances, from his training to his personal relationships, so he could feel secure in the belief that he was working toward the life he truly wanted. But the pressure was mounting.  





**4. Ambivalence Toward External Validation:** Although he longed for respect, recognition, and even admiration, he often found himself ambivalent toward the idea of fame or applause. His pursuits weren’t entirely driven by what others would think. He just wanted to prove to *himself* that he could reach the heights he set for himself.

* The attention of others never really satisfied him. He was aware of how he came across—people could admire his achievements or his strength, but it wasn’t enough. It was the *depth* of his own standards that really mattered. He wanted something deeper—something that could only come from within.  
* He felt that his inner world was more complicated than most people could see. He appreciated when others acknowledged his achievements, but it wasn’t the validation he craved—it was the inner peace and satisfaction that would come from a life well-lived, a life shaped by the principles he valued.  

  
  


**5. Emotional & Intellectual Growth:** He struggled to reconcile the person he wanted to be with the person he was *becoming.* As he learned and evolved, the emotional battles never seemed to fully subside. At times, it felt like the more he achieved, the harder it became to *feel* truly satisfied. The need to constantly improve was always there—there was always something new to learn, another challenge to overcome—but sometimes it was exhausting.

* His idealized version of himself was someone unshakable, emotionally independent, and unafraid to make tough decisions. Yet, the real person struggled with loneliness, doubt, and vulnerability. This internal conflict made him question whether he'd ever truly reach the point where everything clicked, or if he was always going to be searching for the next step.  
* He wasn’t sure if that yearning for personal growth was a result of genuine passion or a need to escape the doubts that surrounded his self-worth. Was he growing because he wanted to, or because he couldn’t accept being anything less than his best?

  


**9. Final Reflection**







His life has been a delicate balancing act between pushing for perfection and learning to accept imperfection. He’s not afraid to stand alone and has developed a sense of inner strength that many others would envy. However, beneath his physical and mental resilience lies a quiet yearning for deeper connections, for a life that transcends his personal ambitions and reaches into the realm of emotional fulfillment.  
  


Whether he achieves this balance or not remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: he will always continue moving forward, relentlessly pursuing self-improvement. His journey is not just about conquering external challenges but also understanding his own internal landscape—striving for a future where his growth is not only measured in physical strength but in emotional depth and interpersonal connection as well.

But more often than not, it feels like there’s a weird energy around it like ""why is this stranger talking to me in public?"" A lot of people seem a little guarded, assuming it’s about trying to hook up...which is completely understandable! There are a lot of predators out there trying to pick up women and treat them like garbage, believe me we hate those F-ing guys too.

But, especially during a time of such isolation and less human interaction as we get older, some people genuinely just want to talk, no weird energy, no expectations, no ulterior motive.

COMPLETELY cleared my eczema in a few weeks. Went on and off dupixent for a while and finally decided to take control and do my own research and try to find out what is causing my eczema. I noticed that after eating certain foods i would itch like crazy and wouldnt sleep. Spaghetti for instance, aka tomato sauce. I payed attention to this for a while until I found a book. Eczema Secrets. Not sure whats up with the website it seems to be down now. But that book led to seek more info and I found a book called Eczema Detox by Karen Fischer. These books talk about chemical intolerance. Histamine salicylates and amines are a few. Specifically the eczema detox book has basically changed my life in 2 weeks. I noticed a change within a few days. The book has a full diet plan and even recipes for each meal of the day. 28 years I’ve suffered not knowing why and now im finally discovering how to change my lifestyle instead of trying different creams that really do nothing long term.

1k67f4u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k67f4u,DaD Tools: Update #3,"Since my last update about a week and a half ago there's been quite a bit of progress with what will hopefully be the ultimate build planner for Dark and Darker.

I use these posts to grow awareness for the tool that will be coming out and take feedback.

* The first announcement I wanted to make was to say the tool will be free to use for everyone, supported by the likes of Patreon and Buy Me a Coffee.

In this update the following features have been added:

* Item and inventory management is similar to the game. I have made it possible to move items in between inventory and equipment slots. It's possible to shift + drag and drop items to quickly duplicate them.
* I have fully implemented spell and music memory with a similar dynamic bar like the game. As you add spells/music the bar will fill up in the order you select your abilities and will even indicate which spells are over memory capacity.
* I have made a lot of progress with the DPS tester to emulate in game damage. It takes into account all parameters including the new resistances that were introduced for enemies. I have added spells as well to the tester.
* I have updated some graphs like the Luck section to show the new curves.
* I have cleaned up tooltips for skills and perks to be nicer.

I am working on a startup that helps local small businesses automate the completion of their Google Business Profile (GBP). 

**Link:** [**Eddy AI**](https://eddyai.webflow.io/)

The GBP is what you see in Maps when you are searching for a local restaurant, chiropractor, coffee shop, pharmacy etc. containing their location, hours of operation, customer reviews etc.  For most small businesses, this profile can be very complex and time-consuming to complete and keep updated but it is very important to secure customers to your small business.

I am trying to identify small businesses in local communities to pilot Eddy with. The only criteria is that they need a physical location (i.e. it can't be a home office). If you have a local business you want to pass this email along to, all the info is in the site above and they can enter the pilot using the ""Sign Up"" button on the main page.

Driver drops it off and when I bring it inside, the bottom of the bag is already soaked and my drink is leaking through the bag. I bring it over to the sink and notice half of my drink spilled and it looks like it tipped over at some point while the dasher handled it because the seal and packaging was still intact. The drink was sitting in a cup holder in the bag which looked secure. I messaged him and he denied spilling it but there was a spot underneath where the bag was left on my porch where you can clearly see the drink leaked through. I find it hard to believe it wasn’t leaking before he dropped it off and if he knew it was leaking he should have said something. I reported it to support (they offered $5) and gave that Dasher a poor rating but I’m not sure who to blame honestly. I’ve never had issues with having drinks delivered from Starbucks or anywhere else before but I’m pretty pissed. I always make sure to handle my orders carefully when I’m dashing.

I'm an ex-senior system engineer who left the corporate world to chase a dream.

On **June 2nd, 2023**, while driving alone away from home, the idea for *Bar of Betrayal* hit me.  
A chaotic, 3D social deduction game. Friends betraying friends, absurd tasks, a killer hiding in plain sight.

A few days later, I sat down and started building.

Fast forward to now, I’ve quit my job, started my own indie studio, and I’m working full-time to bring this game to life. Everything you see, the tasks, UI, multiplayer logic, characters, Steam page, trailers, comic-style marketing, it’s all solo-developed with way too much coffee and a lot of love 😅

🎮 **What is Bar of Betrayal**?

It’s like *Among Us* meets *Overcooked*

* Play as a **Regular**, doing tasks like darts, drinking beer, dancing, and play arcade games
* Or play as a **Rogue**, sabotaging the bar and picking off players one by one
* Trigger **emergency meetings** with security to vote out the traitors
* And even if you die, you can still party and complete tasks as a ghost

It’s built for **friends, streamers, and total chaos**.

# 🧪 ⚙️ The game is still in early development...

This is just the **beginning**.

What you see on the Steam page right now is an early version, a slice of the core gameplay, mechanics, and art direction. It’s playable and networked, but there's a ton more coming:

* 🎯 **More mini-games and bar task**s
* 🧍‍♂️ **More characters and role-based abilitie**s
* 🛠️ **Polished UI and smoother netcod**e
* 🔥 **New sabotage options for Rogue**s
* 🎨 **Visual overhauls, lighting passes, and optimization passe**s
* 💬 **Voice lines, music, and more immersive atmospher**e

My goal is to make *Bar of Betrayal* a fully-featured, replayable party game with *style,* the kind of thing you can play over drinks with friends and never have the same session twice.

🚀 **Why I’m here**:

The Steam page is now live and I would LOVE your honest feedback.

* Does the game stand out to you?
* Are the screenshots and trailer hitting the mark?
* What would make *you* want to play it or wishlist it?

👉 Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3590570/Bar\_of\_Betrayal/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3590570/Bar_of_Betrayal/)

Every wishlist helps more than I can express. And seriously, any thoughts, even brutal ones are appreciated. I want this to be the most fun betrayal game you’ve ever played.

Thanks for reading, and thanks for supporting solo indie devs. This has been the biggest creative leap of my life, and I can’t wait to keep building it, with your help. 🍻",2,1745434951.0,playmygame,5,0.75,False
1k67dax,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1k67dax/mf_the_painter_cat/,[MF] The Painter Cat,"Casey didn’t want to take the job, but she had to. She needed the money to pay the rent and selling her paintings wasn’t covering it. She’d never worked as a maid before. She seldom cleaned her own house. But when a woman at the grocery store remarked how badly she needed a housekeeper and was willing to pay, Casey sucked it up and introduced herself, offering her “services”.

The woman’s name was Meredith. She was 77 years old. She had a modest home in a very nice neighborhood and had asked Casey to come twice a week. Casey would be paid 300 a week – which was pretty good. The first few times were uneventful. Meredith’s house was well maintained and the work minimal. All seemed to be going well and then one day Meredith asked Casey to come into the study. She had a gift for her.

The gift was a canvas, bushes and paint. Meredith wanted Casey to paint her. She would be paid 1000 dollars for the painting when it was finished. Casey accepted the offer immediately. Meredith only asked that Casey paint her as if she were 30 years old but wanted to sit as the model. Casey was confused at first. How to take an old woman and paint her as 30 without ever having known what she’d look like at that age. Meredith didn’t seem too hung up on details, just told her to paint what she thought. Meredith took a seat on a chair near the window. The direct light defined every wrinkle and crevice in her sagging skin. Casey laid out the supplies and set about painting Meredith as she might have been at 30. It wasn’t an easy task.

Casey painted the entire day. Meredith prepared them dinner and they resumed again shortly after. It got dark and Casey kept painting. The lamp light softened Meredith’s features and Casey found herself enjoying the task and took liberty, creating Meredith as lush and fabulous as the soft golden light made her almost beautiful. By midnight the painting was done. Meredith found it remarkable and was overwhelmed with joy. Casey was about to sign it when Meredith stopped her and asked if she would simply sign it “Reynaldo”.

Casey was confused. She didn’t want to sign someone else’s name to her work. Meredith insisted and offered no explanation. Casey, tired and confused, grew agitated with the old woman and insisted on signing her name – which she did. Meredith was so distraught she picked up the brush, set it into the black paint and set about destroying the painting. Casey tried to stop her but Meredith was determined. At last Meredith stepped back, dropped the brush and retreated into her bedroom.

Casey knocked on the door and could hear Meredith crying. She finally decided to let herself in. She said she was sorry and asked to be paid. Meredith slowly got up off the

bed and went to a drawer where she took out a small box and counted out ten one hundred dollar bills. Casey took the money and left.

Casey now had the money she needed for rent and did not return to clean Meredith’s house. At the grocery store later that week the manager appeared annoyed with her. When Meredith commented, the manager told her that Meredith had paid for a painting and that Casey had argued the directions to sign Reynaldo at the bottom. Casey was furious at the suggestion of allowing anyone else to take advantage of her hard work and talent – to which the clerk snapped - Reynaldo had been Meredith’s beloved cat and was a far better painter than Casey would ever be. He had seen the painting with his own eyes and thought it was a hideous disaster.

Casey left, angry. Weeks later she found herself without rent again and no prospects for work so she took up panhandling outside a coffee bar. When she had five dollars she went inside to purchase a bagel for lunch and was amazed to see several portraits of Meredith displayed on the walls, all of them signed “Reynaldo”.

Casey ordered the bagel and remarked on the paintings. She was told they were painted by a cat which belonged to a woman named Meredith who was heir to a whiskey brand fortune.

Casey took her bagel and left. She was bummed that she could have peen paid lots of money to paint and that her prideful refusal had left her worse off than she had been in the beginning.",1,1745434917.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

My oldest son is 14. He’s very mildly autistic (his doctor described it to me as “the way a brain surgeon is just really into brains.”) and has ADHD. He struggled as a young kid with impulsive behavior and making friends, but once he turned around 12, he changed schools and it was like he did a 180. He started taking an anti anxiety med, he got active in things at school and made friends, great grades, and seemed happier than ever.

Then this past year happened, his first in high school. His mental health has taken a nosedive. He still takes his medicine (sertraline) but he has occasional blowups. They’re rare, and start out over something really small, until he’s a mess of crying and becoming aggressive. The last time, he ran off and wouldn’t come back for about 15 minutes. I called his phone, and he was really upset, saying he wanted to kill himself. That terrified me, and I talked to him til he came back. Then we went and got coffee together and had a long talk. He’s struggling with feeling like his friends don’t care about him as much as they do each other, and with a recent breakup. I don’t know if that’s all, because even as close as we are, I’m not foolish enough to think he tells me everything. 

He’s been in therapy for his anger, and I messaged his therapist immediately, who scheduled an emergency session to help my son. He altered their therapy plan, and they created a crisis plan that they shared with me. But I was so scared that I slept in his room the first night, and have hardly let him out of my sight in the two weeks since this happened.

He feels somewhat better. He said his mental health still isn’t great, but it’s coming back up. He’s not as emotional as he was the first few days after the blowup, and he almost seems back to normal most of the time.

But I can’t let it go. I’m absolutely terrified, and can’t sleep. I worry about leaving him alone at all, and check on him if I haven’t heard him in awhile. What makes it harder is the black and white thinking of autism; when asked point blank if he was going to kill himself, he said “probably not. But I can’t tell you for sure because I don’t know the future.”

Has anyone else gone through this? I’ve gotten him in with a wonderful therapist, we’re discussing his medication, and he seems to be doing better. How do I move forward and stop being so scared?",2,1745434900.0,Parenting,4,1.0,False

My dad was diagnosed nearly two weeks ago over the phone. They say they have found strange looking leisons to the liver that they believe it's spread. A full MRI is scheduled for Friday the 25th.

The big problem I'm noticing is his digestive issues and feeling sick.

He also at a ct scan that found this thing also found gall stones. Although that is the least of his problems at the moment I'm assuming!

He is a very reserved character. I think he is still processing this all and doesn't really like talking about it. I think he is still waiting for the full prognosis which is sensible of course. 

I don't think he wants to go through chemo. He had hep c and was treated with interferon which made him very ill.

His diet has always been terrible. But mine is also very restricted. He is even thrown off about having to drink pineapple juice before the scan.

I seem to do better with lactose free milk and I'm wondering if lactose free will help him too? 

Whipped cream seems like a good suggestion. He loves coffee. His appetite has fallen so much this last month he did well yesterday and ate quite a bit. Snacks mainly tho (he loves snacks more than meals really).

I hope the team will give him pain treatment. Worried as he already is prescribed 170mg a day of methadone. I hope they get him to a dietician.

What foods do u recccomed for someone so restrictive? 

Will digestive enzymes help? I've been reading they do?

I also have been giving him 20mg of omneprazole when he is feeling sick! Is that OK.

Currently making him some cheese and egg for protein but I assume he might struggle with that but he seemed interested which is good.

I'm a mess but I'm trying to be strong and just be there to support in any way I can..

He is 66 and I do think he will not have long left especially if he decides against chemo but will support him whatever he decides.

Any websites that can give some good info on diet stuff. He is hoping it's these gallstones causing a blockage but after reading these forums I'm thinking it's the pancan. 

I do hope he doesn't suffer.

Beans in the pic is the 2nd batch (lots of lighter beans already removed, should’ve waited to remove them). Handful of light caramel colored beans and lots of scorched beans in both batches. 


At first I thought the scorching was happening at the beginning of my roast so I tried lowering the power in the drying phase of my roast. 
Temps didn’t vary too much between both roasts, and both took significantly longer to reach first crack than I am aiming for. 


I feel like I’m having trouble getting the right movement of beans in my machine, but also getting up to 400 seems like a struggle for my machine. When I lower the fan sometimes it feels like they all stop moving at all which scares me, and when I push the fan back up they hop. 
Does adjusting the power also affect the movement, or mainly the fan?

Background: SO and I have been together for 6 years, married for 1 and have 2 children. He also has a 6 year old with another woman (bio mom). SO and BM never had a relationship. They had one date on which they conceived the child (she claimed she was on birth control). They both made it clear that they did not want to be together and agreed to co-parent the child. I met SO when the child was a few months old. I was apprehensive about it all but I really liked him and he believed that his personal life would not affect the co-parenting. Oh how wrong this was. The past 6 years have been chaotic.

BM lost it when she found out about me. She called me every insult you could imagine. We live in the same small town and know some of the same people whom she spread horrific rumours about me. Initially, she cut contact between SO and the child for months. Then only permitted contact at her home to prevent me being around the child and only when she needed childcare to get her nails/eyebrows/hair done, go to the gym or go shopping. SO has always payed above and beyond with child maintenance. She now claimed this was not enough and said he would only see the child if he brought extra cash, as if the child was pay per view. For over a year, SO was basically blackmailed into sitting at BMs house (not even allowed to take the child for a walk) only for a few hours per week while BM took his money to treat herself... all because he was afraid of losing his child. When she found out I was pregnant, she made accusations to the police and social services that SO had hurt her and the child and that he was also taking and selling drugs (all proven to be false). Social services stated that contact had to be supervised while they investigated this but BM ignored this, blocked SO's number and he did not see the child for almost 2 years. He had no choice but to issue court proceedings.

During proceedings, BM only agreed to a supervised contact centre but claimed she could not afford to drive there despite it being precisely 5 minutes from her home and demanded SO pay £30 each time for her fuel (a journey that would not even cost £5). SO agreed, attempting to hurry process along but BM took the money and continually made elaborate excuses why the child could not go, thus prolonging the process. During contact, the child would get upset and reject him saying ""mummy said your a bad man"" and ""mummy said I don't like you"". When the court finally ruled contact to be unsupervised at our home, BM accused me of harassing and intimidating her and the child, claiming I was stalking and taking videos recordings of them (all false) in attempts to make out I was dangerous. This was dismissed at court. When coming to a final arrangement, BM refused every suitable day that SO put forward. SO is self employed and rearranged his and his employees schedules to accomodate BM on multiple occasions but every time it went back for court review, BM changed her 'suitability'. Every solution we had, BM put up a road block. She had an excuse for everything. In the end, SO couldn't disrupt his, his employees and our family schedule any further and therefore the final order includes days he works and can not avail of.

For the past 2 years, he has tried arrange other days but BM refuses stating that he needs to pay more first, which he is refusing to do. Every few weeks, she would send abusive messages insulting him, me and our children. She has threatened to report us for various things. During this time, SO has been 'grey rocking' her, ignoring these outbursts and only answering necessary child focused questions. Then of nowhere about 6 months ago, BM just started being nice. She gave SO most of the extra days he has wanted, they've went to school events together and even the child's demeanour has changed too. This has never happened before. SO and I don't know what to think. Maybe BM has finally moved on? or maybe she's changing tactics and playing games? What do you guys think? This morning, she arrived to drop off the child and gave two fancy coffees for SO and I, and also some home baked treats. (I couldn't even enjoy these with fear she laced them with laxatives or something lol) I am really taken aback by this, she has never made a kind gesture towards me before. What does this mean? lol. I have never met her face to face because of the drama and the thought of it gives me anxiety. I will always be skeptical of her and could never trust her or forget what she's put us through but I hope this is the start of us being peaceful and civil to each other. So if anyone has any advice on things that I personally can do to try and keep these good vibes going, it would be greatly appreciated!",1,1745434783.0,coparenting,4,1.0,False

- We’ve been together for 5 years
- Live with her grandmother 
- Have no kids
- She hasn’t actually outright told me I can’t have alone time, but read on and you’ll see what I mean. 

I also apologize for it being lengthy. I didn’t add TLDR because I felt details were necessary to help get accurate responses. I appreciate it if you took the time to read it. 

Lately I’ve just been feeling drained. I barely get any time to myself. I’m either at work, with my girlfriend, or with my friend. The only time I’m truly alone is on my drive to and from work or when I’m taking a shit. That’s literally it.

It’s not that I don’t love my girlfriend, I do. But ever since she lost her job 4 months ago, she’s always home. She barely goes out anymore, except for maybe a few hours on Saturday nights. So on my days off, she’s there too. Sunday has always been “our day,” even back when she worked, and I’m fine with that. But now, my other day off, which used to be my one day to recharge feels like it’s slowly become shared time too, and I never agreed to that.

Before, I used to do things solo. Like I’d wake up, go grab a coffee, sit in the parking lot, and just chill for an hour watching videos. That was my time. But during my last vacation, we started doing these “donut runs” together, and I actually liked it. It was nice. But after the vacation ended, that just became the new norm. Now every time I try to hint that I want to do it alone again, I can tell she gets disappointed. Her tone changes, her mood drops. She says it’s fine, but I can see it isn’t. So I let her come, even when I don’t want to.

And it’s not like I want to be alone all the time, it’s just that I feel like I don’t have any space anymore. She’s always around. And even if she’s not saying anything, just having someone physically there all the time takes up energy. Sometimes I just want to blast music, write, zone out, or watch videos without someone sitting three feet away from me. But there’s nowhere to go, we share a room at her grandma’s place, and her grandma is always in the living room.

I’ve tried bringing this stuff up, but it never goes well. She doesn’t handle these kinds of conversations well. Her tone shifts, she gets passive aggressive, and then I get frustrated and it turns into a fight. And the messed up part is, I know if I were to tell her any of what I’m saying right now, she’d flip it on me and somehow make me out to be the problem. She’s already thrown therapy in my face before, said I need it, even told me “get help” when she’s in that mood during an argument.

And that’s the part that really gets to me. She tells me she wants me to open up more. She says I should try therapy. But the second I do open up about how I’m feeling, it turns into four-hour conversations where I’m stuck trying to explain myself while she hits me with short, passive-aggressive replies, or completely flips what I said. So now I don’t even want to talk to her. It’s easier to say nothing than to be made out as the bad guy just for being honest.

It’s frustrating because in every argument, I’m the one who apologizes. I admit what I did wrong. I own up to it. And it’s never anything major, just dumb things, like forgetting to take the trash out. But I still say sorry. I still try. And she never does. One time I even brought that up, and her response was, “Apologizing without change is manipulation.” Like seriously? I’m trying here. I’m not perfect, but I’m doing the work. And somehow that still gets thrown back in my face.

She’s been in therapy since last August and started meds. I want to believe it’s helping her, and maybe it is in some ways. But honestly, ever since then—and especially since she lost her job—our relationship has felt worse. There are more arguments. The connection feels off. And I hate saying this, but sometimes it feels like she uses her PTSD as an excuse every time she’s cold, distant, or short with me. Like I’m not allowed to feel anything without being told I’m the problem.

And yeah, I’ve noticed lately that I don’t feel as affectionate. I still love her. But it’s hard to want to cuddle, hug, or be close when I feel emotionally burned out all the time. The constant arguing, the walking on eggshells, the way she flips things, it’s just tiring. 

I’m not trying to make her out to be the villain. I’m just tired. I’ve been carrying all the emotional weight in this relationship, and it’s starting to really wear me down.

<div>### Creating a Warm Ambiance with Textiles

Incorporating soft textiles is essential when aiming for cozy balcony decor. Plush cushions, warm throw blankets, and outdoor rugs add comfort and invite relaxation. Opt for weather-resistant fabrics in soothing neutral tones or rich autumn hues to enhance the inviting atmosphere while ensuring durability against the elements.

### Choosing the Right Lighting

Ambient lighting plays a crucial role in transforming an outdoor space into a cozy retreat. String lights, lanterns, and solar-powered candles create a warm glow that encourages evening enjoyment. Layering different light sources adds depth, making the balcony feel welcoming and intimate even after sunset.

### Incorporating Natural Elements

Greenery and natural materials elevate cozy balcony decor by adding life and texture. Consider potted plants, hanging planters, or vertical gardens to introduce freshness without overcrowding. Wooden furniture or bamboo accents complement the natural aesthetic, fostering a serene environment right outside your door.

### Space-Saving Furniture for Comfort

Maximize comfort without sacrificing space by choosing compact, versatile furniture. Foldable chairs, corner benches with soft cushions, or a small coffee table can turn even the smallest balcony into a cozy nook. Focus on pieces that blend functionality with style to maintain an uncluttered, inviting look.

### Personal Touches for a Cozy Feel

Adding personal decor elements helps establish a connection with the space. Decorate with scented candles, colorful pottery, or whimsical art that resonates with your taste. These touches not only enhance the cozy balcony decor but also make the space uniquely yours for relaxation or socializing.

Location: NY 

Is my job breaking some sort of employment safety law. I’m not sure if this is a legal question 

Context:
 I work at a small local shop, and have a regular come in almost daily. They order about $100-150 worth of drinks and food. He is often very aggressive towards the women employees, sometimes even calling them derogatory names. 
I handed him his order, which he wasn’t satisfied with the amount of time it took to make, and he proceeded to berate the staff. 

At this point I snapped and told him if he wasn’t happy with the service I suggest he go elsewhere. At that point he threw the whole cup of coffee on me and another employee. I yelled telling him if he didn’t leave I would call the cops and that he wasn’t allowed to return again. 

The next day I come into my work and HR left a write up waiting for me, explaining that I raised my voice and yelled at a customer to leave (which I don’t have the right to do), and that I can’t bar a customer from coming back. They explained that I escalated the situation. I also feel like the only reason they aren’t banning him is because he spends so much money. 
They told me if I were to ask him to leave again or ban him or even get the police involved, there would be further repercussions.

*April 21, 2025*

Since my father retired in 2020, my mother and I haven’t had real one-on-one time. My father is a clingy husband—always around, controlling, loud. I’ve been avoiding both of them for different reasons. But on that Monday, something rare happened. We dropped him off, then Ma and I went for coffee—just the two of us. For the first time in years.

Honestly, I was a bit hesitant to be alone with her. We used to talk a lot, but sometimes she can be really pushy about certain topics. That’s why I’ve been avoiding her. I know I’m not in the best headspace—honestly, I haven’t been for a long while—and I didn’t want to go through the awkward conversation. I didn’t want to have to explain things to her.

When we got to the mall, she said she wanted coffee. We went to the nearest Starbucks. Eventually, we got our orders, sat at one of the couches, and started talking. We talked like we used to—about the Baguio trip, about little things, nothing heavy. And yet, there was something in the silence between topics that clung to me. A kind of quiet grief I couldn’t name.

I think I missed our conversations.

I don’t know how to continue—or even where to begin. All I could think about was how she’s gotten older. I got a good look at her, and I could see how time had aged her. I noticed how all her hair is gray now, how she has more wrinkles—in her eyes, in her neck. How her freckles are more visible, yet have a certain dullness. We all live under the same roof, but I’ve avoided them a little too much. I wasted five years of keeping my distance, and I still continue to do so.

This is hard to write. I don’t know how to keep going without tearing up.

I have my issues with my mom. How she’s scared of her own shadow. How she thinks I’ll repeat the same mistakes she did. That made her become controlling of me. You know the movie *Finding Nemo*? How Marlin promised he wasn’t going to let anything happen to his son? And Dory told him it was a funny thing to promise?

>

That’s what my mom did to me. That’s why I resented her. But I can’t entirely blame her, right? I could have made my own choices. I chose to let her have that power over me, instead of standing up for myself. So nothing ever happened to me.

I don’t know where this is going. This is honestly a struggle to write. I’ve said a lot already, and yet this story still doesn’t seem to land anywhere clear.

I’m not really the type of person who misses people. I’m a very emotional person, but for some reason, I’m not good at missing anyone. And yet, I think I may have missed my mom. That, or a certain pang of guilt is giving me weird feelings.

I saw how she’s aged. And I feel bad that I never got her away from my father. My mom’s a smart woman, but she and my dad are still so attached to their time—they’re traditional, conservative. She’s fulfilled her role as his wife and has never failed at it. Honestly, I don’t know if I’m just projecting—if she’s truly *trapped*, or if I only *feel* trapped. I don’t know if she stayed for love or because no one ever told her she was allowed to leave.

Was it truly love? Or has a lifelong indebtedness of gratitude shackled her to stay?

I don’t know if she’s tired. Or if I’m just tired enough for both of us.

And I don’t know what kind of daughter I’ve been—resentful, absent, a little cruel. Or just quietly protective in my own way.

I think I missed her. I just didn’t realize how much until I saw how time had touched her face.

I wish she never runs out.

I wish she’s truly happy in the life she’s chosen to stick with.

I wish the weariness would stop showing on her face.",1,1745434336.0,stories,0,1.0,False

It’s 11:55 PM. I’m exhausted. Just got off a long shift at the gas station and I’ve been up since 6 AM. I’m driving home half-asleep and apparently… a little too fast. Almost home, I see those blues lights in my rearview. State trooper pulls me over and I’m thinking, “Okay yeah, my foot is made of lead, fair enough.”

But THEN—this man hits me with the, “Ma’am, how much have you had to drink tonight?”

EXCUSE ME?? Sir, the only thing I’m drunk on is sleep deprivation and gas station coffee.

I told him I hadn’t had a drink in over a year and he goes, “Well you wouldn’t mind doing a few sobriety tests for me then?”

Nope! Not at all! I hopped out that car ready to ace the DUI Olympics.

And then he takes out a breathalyzer, from
a Crown Royal bag, and asks if I know what to do. Nope! Never done one before even when I was drinking. I was ready. So when I tell you I BLEW into that thing like I was tryna put out a forest fire?? I gave it my soul.

He checked it, looked at me, and just said, “Alright. Head back to your car.”

A few minutes later he comes back with a speeding ticket and goes, “Just slow it down, okay?”

YES SIR. WILL DO. But I walked away proud, ticket in hand, knowing that for once in my chaotic life—I WAS RIGHT.

We started off as friends with benefits after meeting on a kink (MDLB/femdom) subreddit of all places. It was hard to find people in our area who are into MDLB, so it was a stroke of luck to find each other and to live so close to each other. After I had to graduate college, I called things off because I would be moving away. She said what I feared. She said that she fell in love with me.
It wasn’t a normal friends with benefits. We cried in each other’s arms, spent quality time with each other in addition to the sexual stuff. We shared our trauma and our hopes and dreams. She didnt have a car so I would drive 5 hours round trip to pick her up. When my dad was suspicious of my mileage being so high, I started renting cars just to pick her up and see her. She would stay with me for a few days every couple weeks. I was so happy I finally found someone to experience these things with and actually wanted to be with me. But I wasn’t sure i loved her enough to start a relationship. My last relationship over 5 years ago, I ended up hurting the person who I thought I loved and I didn’t realize it till it was too late. I pushed my ex to do things sexually and basically coerced into doing things until she would do them. It was selfish of me but I thought it was okay because I was having fun. At the time, I couldn’t see how she wasn’t enjoying sexual things. It’s supposed to feel good. I only realized afterwords when she sent me a long breakup message explaining all the things I did wrong, how I should’ve taken “no” as an answer the first time, treated her better, etc. I broke down and felt like someone had ripped me a part. I felt sick and nauseous at how I acted to someone who I said and thought I loved. It messed me up for a couple years. 
Back to my new gf tho. After I told her I didn’t love her like that, she said that was okay and she understood and said we could be friends. That summer, I sent her pictures of the sunrise when I drank my coffee because I thought she would like it. I missed her sitting beside me at times like that. When I went to bed, I thought about her both sexually and non sexually. I just wanted her here with me. After I eventually moved to my new job a month or so later, I texted her and asked her to FaceTime me. I didn’t know if it was the right decision but I thought all of these thoughts had to mean something. So I asked if she wanted to be my gf. She started hyperventilating and I had to calm her down. I gave her a week to decide and she said yes. We were long distance until she moved to my town to be closer to me and find a job near me. 
It was great, I was happy. Until my bad thoughts came in. I have struggled with depression and anxiety all of my adult life and have been on meds at different times. It’s gotten to the point where I think I may have relationship ocd, but even that Im not sure of. I would have the occasional doubt or nitpick something about her appearance mentally. I would stress about little things sometimes until the thoughts would eventually go away. I would stress about her skin and help her to get skincare products and talk about skincare with her in hopes she would use them. I found out she vaped and was hiding it from me when we were apart after graduating. I helped and pushed her to quit and she was so thankful. However, she started gaining weight due to the nicotine limiting her hunger before. Then I started pushing us to workout together so she would lose weight. We have talked about this stuff on and on. I asked if it was okay that I pushed her to lose weight for aesthetic reasons and for health reasons and she said yes. Even she wanted to lose the weight after a while cuz she thought she was getting fat. I don’t know why I do this. It’s like I look for little things to improve and I want these thoughts to stop cuz it makes me feel like a dirt bag and like I don’t love her. I think I love her. I am happy when she is with me, I enjoy living life with her, I want to take care of her and provide for her, I don’t want to hurt her. When she’s had mental breakdowns, I’ve driven at midnight to go to her apartment and console her and make sure she is okay and safe, even with work the next day. I gave her my used vehicle and I bought a new one so she would have a car to drive to work. I pay for most of the meals. I randomly buy her gifts and things that I know she would like if I see them. She still isnt comfortable driving a lot, so I drive 50 minutes round trip to pick her up when she has time to spend a few days with me. I try to be considerate of her and provide for her. I try to give her advice and help her when she has difficulty organizing life and taking care of herself. I don’t want to ever hurt her. I tell her my end goal in life is to love each other fully and passionately until we both die at 90. Spending everyday loving one another and being happy together. 
As we’ve talked about marriage, I feel like I’m getting more anxious. Doubting myself whether she’s the one, whether I love her, whether I’m good enough for her, etc. It’s becoming more of an issue and it’s causing stress between us. It’s forced me to spend more time analyzing my love for her. I’ve broken down crying in her arms cuz I just want all these thoughts to stop and let me be okay. She’s been supportive and understanding but she’s also been hurt by some of the discussion we have had recently and I hate that I am hurting her with all this. We always have gone to each other for comfort and to talk about our issues and comforted one another and helped one another. But it’s hard to do that, when the issue is about her and I. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve started therapy in an attempt to untangle my brain. I feel like I love her, but I feel so selfish in the ways that I push certain changes or act. Our sex life has decreased a lot due to her work stress these last 6 months, and we’ve talked about wanting to get back to the sex life and kink dynamic we used to have but she has gotten upset at times when I’ve pushed it and talked about it. I worry that some of these doubts started when we stopped having sex as much. I’ve just been so worried lately that I’ve somehow convinced myself that I love her to the point where I care about her a lot and I do all the things someone does when they love someone, but secretly I’m still the selfish jerk who only used the other person for sex. I just hate my thoughts and want them to stop. I still look at other women and I hate that I do that. There’s a girl at work that I find attractive that made me anxious but I also worry that was my anxiety or maybe undiagnosed relationship ocd where I was just obsessed with the thoughts about her rather than actually wanting a relationship with her. I worry about whether my relationship is secretly all about sex even though I care about her and love her in many ways outside of sex. Im just so lost and confused now. She went through a traumatic divorce when she was younger. She’s tried to date guys but she never liked them. When she met me, she said she instantly felt safe with me. She’s said I am the best man she has ever been with and that I treat her so well. I always feel like I never deserve those kind words and always feel like I don’t do enough for her. Like even though she believes it, I somehow think I’ve tricked her or conditioned her into thinking that way about me. I don’t want to ever hurt her or ruin her faith in love. I don’t know how I could live with myself knowing I hurt her. She is so kind, loving, affectionate, and amazing. She takes such good care of me and she is so patient with me. She understands my mental health issues and wants to help me through these bad times because I have helped her when she has gone through bad mental health episodes. This whole time I’ve thought I’ve changed from the person who took advantage of my ex. I tried to keep that in mind and make a change and to never hurt someone like that again. But I’m scared that I’m going to realize that I’m still the same person, and I only convinced myself that I was different. I don’t want us to get married and I realize I never actually loved her. I can’t put her through that again. I love her. I just want all these bad mean thoughts to go away and I want to love her as easy as she loves me. I started taking Wellbutrin a month ago, and I want to get off it now due to making these thoughts worse. Lately with my mental stress making me feel depressed, it’s been hard to look at her and feel the love I have for her. Last night, we were watching tv together after I was having lots of anxiety and had to take a walk cuz I was so agitated. I asked if I could hold her boobs while we watched tv. She often lets me touch them when we are just lounging around. I was already starting to feel better after we snuggled because I often feel great when we do that. But when I grabbed her boob, it was a slight but instant ease in my chest and I felt a bit better. When I let go of her boob, my chest tightened up a bit again. Then I laid my head on her bare chest. I felt so cozy, warm, loved, and happy. But then, I got sad. I got sad because even though I felt close to her and loving and warm towards her again, i felt that way after holding her boobs. It just made me play more into the thought that I love her for our kink and snuggles rather than her. Or maybe the feeling I had when I touched her was normal, and it just got me to a point where I could destress and feel the normal loving feelings I have for her. I just want all of this to be figured out. I want to be comfortable with us and happy with us. I’m tired of doubting my love for her and our future together. She says that she thinks it was Gods plan we found one another. Is it possible to love someone and still have these thoughts? I want to love her to the end of time and beyond and grow old together. She’s my rock and she is so valuable to me and takes such good care of me. We share the same morals and politics and values. If I really don’t love her, then I want to know that. But if my doubts and worries are just all in my head, then I want to know that too. I don’t want to make a mistake by staying together or by breaking up. And please don’t just say I should break up. If you analyzed everything I said and think so, then feel free. I just feel like a lot of people on this subreddit say break up because it’s easy for them to say. Thank you. 
P.S. Also I feel like I don’t understand what love is supposed to feel like. I only had one other relationship that I messed up. My parents did not have a normal love and were dysfunctional.

Is this normal or am I getting shifted into the friend zone?,"Hey all! Posting here for a little insight about my current crush. 

We are coworkers, and I have had the biggest crush on him for a year. I used to be SOOOOO nervous around him to the point where I could barely talk to him and I was so shy around him, so when we would find each other in the break room alone it would just be a big smile and say hi and then the air get very heavy as I went quiet and eventually left. He eventually broke the ice and kinda called me out about it in a very playful cute way; we were in the break room alone one day after like 3 months of me going quiet in this situation and then leaving, before I had the chance to leave he was like “well, here we are again” and we both laughed and started small talking. Since then things have only progressed more and more and things have built. He locks eyes with me and doesn’t break eye contact, always gives me a really big smile and seems really happy to see me, and I reciprocate. I even noticed him becoming more shy and what appears to be nervous around me. He doesn’t seem to act this way around other female coworkers from what I can tell, and there have been many times when I’m talking and he’s just staring at me as if he’s getting lost in my eyes. The more we have talked at work the more we have started to open up to each other, and he always is asking me questions about myself and what appears be him trying get to know me more. However last week, it was the first time that I noticed when we were talking for almost an hour that I wasn’t very nervous around him and was actually really comfortable around him, and he seemed really Comfortable around me and didn’t seem as nervous or shy. 

I want to take this as a good thing in thinking that a crush is developing more, and I get the impression that he likes me back, but part of me can’t help but think that he may just now see me as a friend if he’s no longer nervous around me and is now comfortable. There is definitely sexual tension and it feels mutual, but yeah. Is this normal? Do you start to feel more comfortable around your crush as feelings and a connection develops more? Or should I take this as a sign that he just starting to see us as friends? Before y’all start telling me, yes, I want to make a move and flat out ask him to coffee or something like that. But it’s a delicate dance with coworkers (I  know how people feel about that too), and I’m enjoying the progression it’s been making so far and getting that “slow burn” type of connection.

1k66vzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1k66vzy/things_i_miss/,Things I miss,"Having anorexia makes me remember the way I acted before I was anorexic. I was just a different person and had lots of things that I did, that were not centered around a fear of weight gain or a worry about what I looked like. When your health significantly changes, it's going to change your personality and how you view yourself. So I find it helpful to remind myself of positive things about myself that being ill changed for me. And it reminds me to challenge my thoughts, and to take small steps towards getting better from anorexia. To eat, even when I am anxious. To shift my perspective and to remind myself I can work on changing. I don't have to stay stuck. I can improve my health. Even if full recovery seems hard to imagine right now

1. I miss eating food, and not worrying about the calories in the food or whether it will make me gain weight. I had a lot more freedom around eating before the anorexia. If I felt like eating a muffin, I ate a muffin. No guilt or anxiety afterwards. That's something I miss. You can't enjoy food if you feel bad about everything you eat

2. I miss looking in the mirror and not having low self esteem about how I looked. I weighed more before the anorexia, but never felt it made me look bad. I never thought ""I could lose weight."" And I miss that. I had a sense of confidence in myself and how I looked before. If I did feel anxiety, the anxiety didn't cause me to feel the need to lose weight or feel bad about my body. Now, even though I am underweight, I have worse self esteem. My anxiety is worse. Anorexia affects your thinking and causes you to view yourself differently

3. I miss having different hobbies, passions, and interests about things. Being sick changed a lot of this. I used to cook. I don't cook as much anymore. Now, I am really particular about what I eat, and have anxiety if I eat a food I am not used to. This means I would have a difficult time making something I have never eaten. I used to write about a lot of different things. Now, I write mostly about my anorexia because it's on my mind, a lot of the time. I used to go to movie theaters, malls, and parks. I liked going to different coffee shops to try a new coffee. When I was healthier. Now, my health is worse. I stay home a lot and don't go out as much anymore because of the worsening health complications the anorexia has caused. So anorexia caused me to lose my freedom and ability to relax, in a way. 

4. Anorexia changed how my parents see me. I feel like they always focus on my eating disorder and that they are always worried when they are around me. Even when they do not directly say something to me, the illness has clearly affected my relationship with my parents. Things were just different, before my anorexia. They have always been very supportive, but I think it's hard for them to see someone they care about battle a life threatening mental illness. They want me to fully recover and get better. They have some understanding about anorexia, but don't understand why I have a difficult time stopping certain behaviors. So in the past, they sometimes said things they did not mean. But they are always here if I need them

5. I miss my health. I wish I could reverse the medical complications I currently have. They hurt, constantly. They make me more depressed. And they cause me to lose motivation to get better. I work with my treatment team and they tell me to not blame myself or be mad at myself. Anorexia nervosa isn't a choice, after all. And you can't determine how it's going to affect your body or what side effects it's going to cause. I try to remain positive",5,1745433768.0,AnorexiaNervosa,1,1.0,False

At first I was kind of like whatever not that big of a deal but today was such a beautiful outside and I asked 5 ppl if they wanted to hang out(all of which were on campus) and they’re all busy and it really dampened my day to get rejected back to back to back.
Yes I understand that people are busy but no one ever reaches out to me for literally anything. To get coffee, lunch, simple rant session, quite literally nothing. I attempted to join a sorority but ended up dropping and the girls that claim “we are still friends” haven’t texted me since and even before dropping it was still a struggle to hang out with them. 
I try really hard to put myself out there and make genuine connections but it never feels reciprocated or it’s only for the moment. I haven’t had a best friend since 2021 and I really want to get to that point with someone but VERY CONVENIENTLY every single person I know is busy or they already have a friend group. 
It’s already hard to make friends in college and this just makes it harder. I’m about to graduate having not making a single friend.

1k66u0i,https://i.redd.it/rq66s4xbqmwe1.jpeg,AIO: I Feel Unsafe in my Living Situation,"I have been living with one of my really good friends for a little less than a year. Everything was great for a while, until recently, a string of events have happened. I was out of town with one of my best friends for 10 years. A homeless person threw trash in our yard and she sent me a picture. I replied right away and told her that was insane and to text our landlord. She gets mad at me that I did not offer to drive 4 hours home, and that I did not say thank you for dealing it right away. She told me she bought supplies and I needed to venmo her half, which I did. Fast forward to when I come home late at night and go straight to bed. A couple hours after I go to sleep, I get multiple phone calls from her and banging at my door stating that we need to talk right now about the situation. From 1 am to 5am we talked and she said she was not letting me go to bed until I said thank you. She had an entire list of everything I had ever done wrong. One of them being that I accidentally shorted her 50 cents for the supplies which ended up being $100. She brought up that she “never wanted me to drive home” but would then bring up that her brother canceled his birthday party to come help her since I wouldn’t come help. She ended the story by saying that during the weekend, she told one of our mutual friends that I’m lesbian (I am not). I did have work that next day, so I got about 3 hours of sleep total before having to go into work.

A couple days later, she tells me that she’s getting a dog. She applied for it and put a deposit down when I was out of town. I was pretty against the dog considering we had never had a sit down conversation about a dog in the house. She then proceeds to tell me the reason she is getting the dog is because I am not around that much to keep her company (I have a boyfriend, I work in office 4 days a week, this is my busy season, I’ve been helping my friend plan her wedding, etc) I told her my one rule about the dog was that it cannot get on the couch since I own it and it’s a white couch. At first she agreed to this rule.

Fast forward to when she gets the dog.  The dog is as sweet as can be, but has some separation anxiety which I get when it’s a new dog in a new environment. She then starts calling it “our dog.” I correct her and tell her that it’s her dog, since I am not putting any money into this dog, and she starts telling me that I am mean and now the dog is sad that I said that. She got very mad at me to the point that every time I would try to talk to her, she would only talk to the dog. I recommended her getting a crate for the dog so it can have a safe place while she’s at work, but she disagreed and said the dog would feel like it was punished (she also showers with the dog because she doesn’t want to keep it in her room for the same reason).

About a week goes by and she had already broken my rule about the dog on the couch, and barely talk to me. Still the same issue where every time I would talk she would start having a conversation with the dog. I started spending more time at my boyfriends since I just didn’t feel welcomed at home. She had started leaving peanut butter in the dog bowl overnight, which made the downstairs smell putrid and then out of no where started using one of my bowls as a secondary option for the dog to eat out of (don’t ask me why). We went to a comedy show together with one of our other friends and the entire time she would not look at me or make direct conversation with me. By this point, I was done trying to be her friend if she cannot even look me in the eye.

Then comes Easter. I am spending it with my boyfriend and some family friends. She texts me and tells me that some other trash has been thrown over the fence, and since I don’t help the first time (when I was out of town) she didn’t expect me to help this time. I was taken aback from this message since she was not asking for help, she was just accusing me of already not helping. 3 hours later, she texts me that I have been a terrible person and a terrible roommate and she’s done with me, and that I spent way too much time with my boyfriend now. Personally, I had no problem with this since she has been accusing me for weeks of being a bad friend.  A couple times this week she has started unplugging my appliances like my ice maker and coffee maker so when I wake up in the morning there is no ice or coffee (which she knows i use every single day).

Last night, I come home to a group of pictures with me cut out and thrown into the trash. These are pictures we took together over the years that were in photo frames. I was specifically cut up and thrown into the trash. I have no idea what to do anymore. Before I saw the cut out photos (attached) I had a message typed out explaining that I know we aren’t friends anymore, but we need to set boundaries to make the rest of this lease go smoothly. However, now I don’t even feel safe leaving my room let alone talking to her. I really want to get out of to get out of there and I feel like it needs to be sooner than when my lease ends in July.

She’s been like this before. For example: my boyfriend or any other guys I have as friends are not allowed over, so they have never seen my place. Recently, I have noticed that my mail isn’t being delivered. I had a credit card go missing, a letter from my mom, a save the date, and a birthday invitation. All of them have been marked delivered but they aren’t in our mailbox.  My friends think she is being obsessive and frankly a little crazy.  Am I overreacting? Should I be this scared of her?

""SERIOUS inquiries only please. And please be sure to include a photo of your car. PENPAL!","Hi there! I'm James (for an age reference, I am 38, married, Catholic), a graduate student who’s looking for pen pal(s). I’d love to connect through email and maybe write letters with wax seals someday. If you're interested, please reach out!

I’m here posting this when  I should be doing work....aka writing reports (eg, IAs (initial assessments) and Conceptualizations over and over; it is thrilling! I had the thought to find a pen pal to write to, but had no idea where to look. I have both a light and dark sense of humor, all about context.

I feel like my life’s road was designed by Dr. Seuss, twisted, irrational, and just silly. 

I am a dog person. I'm thinking email for a few roles through correspondence, and if both are comfortable, eventually moving to handwritten letters. In today’s digital age, having a pen pal I foresee providing this unique opportunity to build friendships that might…..then again... would absolutely NOT happen otherwise.

Interests: I play cello, shoot guns and archery, study psychology, hypnosis, astronomy, and am an ultra coffee snob. Classical music was heavy metal before electricity. Bach will always be my going-to-battle music. Or Promontory (Last of the Mohicans), which is hypnotic! 

I foresee each letter feels like a little adventure waiting ot unfold. You never know what a pen pal may share - from stories of their life, interesting local customs, embarrassing/funny/victorious stories. This discovery will keep things fresh, I imagine, as well as encourage me to try new things and broaden my cultural horizons, so to speak. I am a bit of a cross between a driven/bold/adventurous, dominant male, aka a gentleman, that fine line between being a prick when it is appropriate. Please don’t think I am filling out a dating profile here, just giving you the gist. I enjoy red wine, cigars, shooting, philosophy, psychology, human behavior, hypnosis, Amsterdam (had an unforgettable trip and class I took there), French, German, Scottish/Irish cultures, and music. 

Write about our own past journeys, like my flying, spontaneous whatevers, future aspirations, life-changing events for the good & bad, achievements, goals, stories, etc. 

I have a great interest in the Japanese/Irish/Scottish cultures. As well their fashions, traditions, music, etc. 

I also adore drawing and painting when I have the time. Thus painting is a rarity recently but I always have time to “doodle.”

I am past the party phase of life and have more fun staying at home drinking wine/cocktails/bourbon/whisky/fu’fu’ drink when I am able to or going out to a cigar bar with a friend. However, my life currently consists of most weeks being up until 3 a.m. studying.

Again, this is scratching the surface, I adore traveling to the South (Alabama - Georgia - etc.), an almost 180 culture from where I reside in the west of the USA. I adore how you can speak to a stranger there and they speak to you in such a warm aura, almost feeling like they are family (well, most anyway). Just a unique quality of the South that you don't notice as much in the more western states in the country, I find at least. 

I look forward to hearing from whoever is interested in correspondence writing. It's another kind of adventure waiting to be explored.

My husband and I used to live in the Pacific Northwest and now live in the Northeast, but we've been dreaming of a future move to the Bay Area. We both love it there, but don't know it enough to have any real rental savvy. 

I've read a lot about ideal and less ideal neighborhoods within the city, but we don't necessarily need to be in San Francisco proper. So here's my question: if you were a laid-back, quiet couple in your 30s with pets and no plans to have kids, where would you want to rent outside the city? Let's assume no commute for now. 

Things we value: safety, nice walks, nice neighbors, good coffee, artsy and progressive communities, not going completely broke. Green space nearby would be amazing, since I know a yard may be too much to ask in a lot of these places.

So this week I received two different requests, one for a German and one for a mixed breed. They’re both for Memorial Day and I’m going thru some meet and greets for other potential clients, so I told them I’d get back to them when I was sure if I could take them or not. (Both new clients.) 

Today I was going thru requests again to start setting up meet and greets when I noticed something odd. Both requests had the same photos. One had more, about 8, as well as a completed profile and a review from a previous sitter - I had chatted with this account and set up a meet and greet for Saturday. The other only had two photos which were the same as the profile pics on the other account, and the profile was not completed. So I messaged both accounts asking why this was, sending screenshots of both accounts. The “established” account still hasn’t answered me (about an hour ago). The less established account messaged back, saying “that’s weird.” I replied saying that in all honesty the account seemed like a scam account unless they could provide a good explanation for the situation. They replied detailing the weather in the city I live in and mentioning who our sports team is playing. This to me seemed like a classic scam move - provide info that seems to prove they’re from here but is in fact just something you can find online. I replied letting them know that that’s all info that could be found online. Their answer was to say they are going to a nearby coffee shop with their dog if I’d like to meet them to prove “he’s not full of it”. This also seemed scammy to me - again, look up a local place, say you’ll meet, have “an emergency” so you don’t have to. I said no thank you and archived the request. 

At this point he sends a picture of his dog with a paper with the dogs name and todays date on it (very Redditesque, lol). In the background is a doormat with our city’s sport team logo on it. At this point I think, he may be real. Regardless the situation is weird already so I’m not interested in pursuing him as a client. He tells me that it’s a new account which is why it may seem fishy. I reply saying that it seems fishy because he has the same profile picture as another, more established account, and that I’m not comfortable with him messaging me anymore, and definitely won’t be caring for any dogs he may or may not have. 

At this point he answers with the following (I’ve hidden it because it’s sexual and derogatory: >!Do you let your girlfriend f**k you in the a**?!< Now, my fiancée and I share an account and she receives notifications for the messages, as do I. It’s one thing if you send that to me but you’ve just sent that to my fiancée as well. I immediately block and report his account. I’m waiting on Rover Support to message back so I can put an official complaint and request for suspension on record. 

Oh, and just before I block him I get a call from an unknown number that I don’t answer because I’m positive it’s him calling my River number. Fun day. ",1,1745433427.0,RoverPetSitting,1,1.0,False
1k66pld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Propmanagementwisdom/comments/1k66pld/7_ways_landlords_can_show_tenant_appreciation/,7 Ways Landlords Can Show Tenant Appreciation,"Tenant appreciation is one of the most important parts of being a [landlord](https://4rentlocal.com/2025/04/09/how-often-should-landlords-inspect-their-properties/) Tenant appreciation is one of the most important parts of being a [landlord](https://4rentlocal.com/2025/04/09/how-often-should-landlords-inspect-their-properties/) because, it shows your tenants that you care about them and actually value your business.

In today’s busy world though the big question is how should you be showing your tenants that you appreciate them? With so many options available it’s easy to get lost in a sea of decisions and not do anything at all.

Thankfully, in this article we’ve compiled a list of things that you can properly show tenant apprciation.

# 1. Send a Holiday or Seasonal Greeting

A simple card or email during holidays or at the start of each season can go a long way. Consider adding a small gift card to a local coffee shop or market. It’s a low-cost, high-impact gesture that shows you’re thinking of your tenants as more than just names on a lease.

# 2. Celebrate Lease Anniversaries

Acknowledging the anniversary of your tenant’s move-in date is a great way to show you value their continued residency. You might send a thank-you card or a small gift or even offer a one-time rent discount or bonus amenity (like a carpet cleaning or appliance upgrade).

# 3. Offer Small Upgrades or Improvements

When a tenant renews a lease, consider offering a minor [property](http://www.rentbeavertonhomes.com/) upgrade. This could be a new showerhead, better lighting, fresh paint, or updated blinds. It shows you’re committed to improving their living space and not just maintaining the status quo.

# 4. Host a Tenant Appreciation Event

If you manage multi-family units or apartment complexes, a casual tenant appreciation event—like a summer BBQ, pizza night, or holiday gathering—can build community and goodwill. It also allows tenants to connect with you and each other in a relaxed setting.

# 5. Be Responsive and Respectful

One of the most overlooked ways to show appreciation is simply being a responsive and respectful landlord. Promptly addressing maintenance issues, giving proper notice before inspections, and being courteous in communication help tenants feel respected and valued.

# 6. Create a Local Perks Program

Partner with local businesses to offer discounts or special deals for your tenants. This could include nearby gyms, restaurants, or dry cleaners. It benefits both your tenants and your local community and adds value to your [property.](http://www.portlandrentalmanagement.com/)

# 7. Recognize and Reward Good Tenants

Tenants who pay on time, take care of the property and communicate well are worth keeping. Consider offering a loyalty reward, such as a modest rent discount after a year of on-time payments, or a “tenant of the month” spotlight with a small prize. Recognition goes a long way toward making tenants feel seen and appreciated.

Happy tenants are long-term tenants. By showing appreciation in thoughtful, personal ways, landlords can build trust, reduce turnover, and create a more positive rental experience for everyone involved. You don’t need a big budget to make a big impression—just consistency, communication, and a little creativity.

Sorry for the long post 🙈

Background: SO and I have been together for 6 years, married for 1 and have 2 children. He also has a 6 year old with another woman (bio mom). SO and BM never had a relationship. They had one date on which they conceived the child (she claimed she was on birth control). They both made it clear that they did not want to be together and agreed to co-parent the child. I met SO when the child was a few months old. I was apprehensive about it all but I really liked him and he believed that his personal life would not affect the co-parenting. Oh how wrong this was. The past 6 years have been chaotic.

BM lost it when she found out about me. She called me every insult you could imagine. We live in the same small town and know some of the same people whom she spread horrific rumours about me. Initially, she cut contact between SO and the child for months. Then only permitted contact at her home to prevent me being around the child and only when she needed childcare to get her nails/eyebrows/hair done, go to the gym or go shopping. SO has always payed above and beyond with child maintenance. She now claimed this was not enough and said he would only see the child if he brought extra cash, as if the child was pay per view. For over a year, SO was basically blackmailed into sitting at BMs house (not even allowed to take the child for a walk) only for a few hours per week while BM took his money to treat herself... all because he was afraid of losing his child. When she found out I was pregnant, she made accusations to the police and social services that SO had hurt her and the child and that he was also taking and selling drugs (all proven to be false). Social services stated that contact had to be supervised while they investigated this but BM ignored this, blocked SO's number and he did not see the child for almost 2 years. He had no choice but to issue court proceedings.

During proceedings, BM only agreed to a supervised contact centre but claimed she could not afford to drive there despite it being precisely 5 minutes from her home and demanded SO pay £30 each time for her fuel (a journey that would not even cost £5). SO agreed, attempting to hurry process along but BM took the money and continually made elaborate excuses why the child could not go, thus prolonging the process. During contact, the child would get upset and reject him saying ""mummy said your a bad man"" and ""mummy said I don't like you"". When the court finally ruled contact to be unsupervised at our home, BM accused me of harassing and intimidating her and the child, claiming I was stalking and taking videos recordings of them (all false) in attempts to make out I was dangerous. This was dismissed at court. When coming to a final arrangement, BM refused every suitable day that SO put forward. SO is self employed and rearranged his and his employees schedules to accomodate BM on multiple occasions but every time it went back for court review, BM changed her 'suitability'. Every solution we had, BM put up a road block. She had an excuse for everything. In the end, SO couldn't disrupt his, his employees and our family schedule any further and therefore the final order includes days he works and can not avail of.

For the past 2 years, he has tried arrange other days but BM refuses stating that he needs to pay more first, which he is refusing to do. Every few weeks, she would send abusive messages insulting him, me and our children. She has threatened to report us for various things. During this time, SO has been 'grey rocking' her, ignoring these outbursts and only answering necessary child focused questions. Then of nowhere about 6 months ago, BM just started being nice. She gave SO most of the extra days he has wanted, they've went to school events together and even the child's demeanour has changed too. This has never happened before. SO and I don't know what to think. Maybe BM has finally moved on? or maybe she's changing tactics and playing games? What do you guys think? This morning, she arrived to drop off the child and gave two fancy coffees for SO and I, and also some home baked treats. (I couldn't even enjoy these with fear she laced them with laxatives or something lol) I am really taken aback by this, she has never made a kind gesture towards me before. What does this mean? lol. I have never met her face to face because of the drama and the thought of it gives me anxiety. I will always be skeptical of her and could never trust her or forget what she's put us through but I hope this is the start of us being peaceful and civil to each other. So if anyone has any advice on things that I personally can do to try and keep these good vibes going, it would be greatly appreciated!",1,1745433335.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I have a partner and two kittens.  I'm a very curious person, the kind of guy who enjoy reading articles in Wikipedia or going to foreign places using Google maps. I also like YouTube and watching series on streaming platforms. In person I like going to bars and drinking good coffee and trekking. I think I'm a very good listener if you want that kind of friendship though I don't like when friendships are one sided or people who just tell you their problems. 

The main reason I'm here is because I used to have penpals in the past and that was really fun and my close circle of friends is now limited to my girlfriend and her close circle, my work colleagues and a side project related to my profession so in practice I have no IRL friends from my side. I'd like to meet people here and see where it goes. 

I'd be interested in people who might be into a short length but continual communication on Reddit at least at the beginning. Not really interested in long letters anymore as they become a chore to write and send.

I spent some time browsing Ao3 but since it's an older fandom I thought I'd ask for recommendations wherever the works may be posted.

**Characters I like** and want to read about (in order): Death, Crowley, Castiel, Dean, Gabriel, Meg, Kevin, Bobby, Naomi

**Characters I don't like** and don't want to read about: Ruby, Lucifer, Michael, any of the canonical love interests, the Winchester family, Lilith, Eve

**Characters I don't mind** as long as they're not the POV/main character: Sam (fics focusing on the brothers and their relationship are the exception), Azazel, Abaddon, Leviathans, Metatron, all angels/demons/monsters

I'm not interested in AUs, so no Alpha/Omega, Coffee Shops, High Schools, etc. The only ship I'm interested in is **Destiel** as long as there's **no porn**, so nothing rated explicit. The height of what I'm fine with is kissing. NO PENISES. Please. I can make an exception for occasional smutty passages I can simply scroll past but overall I'd rather avoid them entirely.

I tend to favour long plot-driven fics but am also partial to character studies, short angstfest, disasterfics, fics exploring various (platonic) relationships, canon divergence, all of it. Angst is great, I love general violence and heavy themes but don't like fluff, OOC and don't want to come across any sort of sexual violence.

Spoilers are fine, so fics can span all 15 seasons. 

I hope there are some hidden gems for me out there and am thankful in advance for everything I get. :)",2,1745433257.0,FanFiction,1,0.75,False

I need some honest insight from people outside my circle. I broke up with my boyfriend a few days ago, but I’m questioning whether I was too harsh. English isn’t my first language, so I’ll try to keep this as clear as possible.

I (F24) met this guy (M28) in September 2024, and by November we were officially in a relationship. From the start, I was clear with him that I’d be going abroad for a 3.5-month exchange program starting in January. It was something I’d been looking forward to for a long time. He told me that was no problem.

The first few months were everything I’d ever hoped for. We spent so much time together, became close really fast. He was kind, funny, understanding, treated me well — honestly, he became my best friend. We lived only 5 minutes apart and spent most of the winter cozied up inside together.

I left for my exchange in January 2025. After a few weeks, something started to change. He didn’t stop being “nice” necessarily, but he started questioning everything I did. To be clear, he had always said he didn’t mind me going out or having male friends. He knew I didn’t go out that often anyway, and he supported the idea that I just wanted to explore this new country while I had the chance.

It began subtly. I’d be home, just relaxing, and he’d message things like, “Are you really at home?” or “I hear sounds, are you with someone?” I dismissed it at first. But it escalated. I’ve always been quite mature and direct — I don’t play games — so I told him I didn’t appreciate being accused of things. He admitted he was wrong and apologized. I tried to be understanding, because clearly the insecurity came from somewhere. I tried to talk to him about it and reassure him.

That’s when he asked for my Snap location. I had nothing to hide, so I shared it. But then he started asking me to FaceTime every single time we talked — or whenever he wanted. I told him no. I had no problem FaceTiming in general, but keep in mind we had a time difference, and I had my own schedule. I wasn’t going to FaceTime a grown man from a coffee shop (Wawa, for example) just to “prove” where I was.

Whenever I said no, the accusations would start again. He’d say things like “You’re definitely with someone,” “You’re probably partying,” even though I was honest about my plans. If I was going to a party, I told him. But he’d still accuse me of being out at weird hours, like 1 PM on a weekday.

It got worse. He started making comments like “I’m sure guys try to hit on you every day,” “You probably get a lot of attention,” “Your follower count just went up by X number.” I got tired of it. I told him he needed to stop. I already had enough stress navigating school and life in a new country — I didn’t need my own boyfriend adding to it. He’d apologize. But I swear, two days later he’d start another argument and accuse me of insane things. Things like “I know you’ve been with someone, you probably kissed someone at least.”

Eventually I asked for space. That’s when he spiraled. As soon as I asked for a bit of distance, he blew up my phone — messages nonstop, 20+ calls. He confessed he wasn’t doing well, that his mom was sick, that he wasn’t sleeping, and suddenly, he tells me he’s struggling with mild substance use. He said that’s why he was acting this way, that he was scared of losing me, and that I’m the only thing keeping him stable.

I took him back. And it started again.

So I finally chose myself. I prioritized my own well-being and mental health. I ended things. Again, I was bombarded. Texts, calls every five minutes. He told me I was cold. That I never loved him. That if I could leave him so “easily,” he must mean nothing to me.

I want to add: I gave him so many chances. I listened. I cried. I told him how much this was affecting me. I truly believe this could’ve been solved — it was fixable. He told me he only accused me because he was scared of losing me. But the accusations are exactly what made me walk away?

We were together for about five months. I accepted more than I should have, and I’m angry at myself for it. He said things like “You’re heartless, if you can just drop me like this,” and even “I’ll take sleeping pills and hope I don’t wake up.” I know these things were just manipulative guilt tactics — but they still messed with my head. I broke up with him. And I know I deserve better. But what really confused me was that he always reassured me, apologised, said that he knew that I deserved better, asked me to please be patient - but I feel like he asked for too much? 

So now I’m left wondering:	
 -  Do you think I was too harsh?
- We were still in the early stage… should I have been more patient?
- Have you ever dealt with someone like this
- Do you think he actually loved me? Or was it limerence or something else?  He must have been deeply insecure and obssesed/limerence?

I’m trying to make sense of it all. I feel hurt, confused, and honestly just really exhausted. I feel like I wasted months of my life. If anyone ever dealt with a man like this or if you know what’s wrong with him, let me know. Also may i add, this man introduced me to his whole family, his friend, took me to his work party, went to another country together, started planning a lot.

first off, i’m a barista at a busy coffee shop (customer service workers are bound to be under appreciated but oh well) and a lot of the customers that i talk to aren’t very appreciative. a lot of them don’t say thank you, or even say “you too” when i tell them to have a good day. maybe it’s just my mind making it bigger than it actually is! however, i’ve noticed that more customers act that way instead of being generally respectful to us baristas. and when there’s a small mistake (which is usually easily fixable), some blow it up and make a bigger deal out of it than it usually is, making us feel bad on our part. 

on a more personal level, i feel like people i once knew (like old friends) and even some of my family don’t care about being appreciative towards me. i don’t mean to sound like i’m complaining, but… i am! so tomorrow is my 19th birthday and all i can really think about is how i’m just going to spend it with my close family, nobody else really remembers or cares enough to join. lately, i was talking to my parents about plans to celebrate, and we mentioned going out of town. but my dad only talked about wanting to go to the casino outside of the city, but nothing about my birthday…? so when i told him that it was my birthday and i wanted to focus on that, all he had to say was “so…?” like… dude what?

and yesterday, i was making dinner for my family, and as i was finishing it up, my dad comes downstairs and tells us that he’s going to the casino. another time he mentioned that. i’ll admit, i got a bit mad at him and scoffed at him, and he replied with “i don’t eat that!” and… i don’t know. it just makes me feel like he doesn’t care about me or what i do sometimes. especially when he mentions that fucking casino. i don’t mind him having hobbies of course, but he only mentions it when i’m trying to do something for him or spend time with him.

i’ve always been the gifter, not the gifted. the listener, not the one who vents. the one who never has plans, not because i’m busy, but because i’m never thought about. i wish i could be born again just so i can change the future… so i don’t have to feel this way anymore. the past few days i’ve done nothing but think about it and cry my eyes out, feeling sorry for myself. but i just don’t know how to accept it… nobody wants to be under-appreciated. the feeling is awful and weighs on your shoulders for a long period of time. what do i do?",2,1745433149.0,Vent,10,0.75,False

I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (30m) for just over 8 years (met in 2017). We met when I was in college, and he was working. Our relationship has generally been good. We did a year-long distance after a year of being together but have lived together for over 6 years now.

When I was at university after about a year, I said explicitly I wanted to be married before 30 but no kids before then. To be honest, I was expecting to get engaged after I graduated (in2020), but COVID hit, he had a few surgeries, and we were just trying to survive. 

We both have decent jobs and bought a house 2 years ago in a good area and have a dog. I think people look at us and see the ‘perfect’ couple, but honestly, we’re far from it. Last year I had a bit of a crisis before my 27th as I kind of realised 30 was coming faster than I thought, and we weren’t engaged. I also felt he wasn’t really taking the future seriously in terms of looking after himself and showing he could look after kids (it’s a small thing, but before letting our dog out into the backyard after the dog asked, he’d take his time and go to the bathroom or get a coffee first). I know it’s a small thing, but even things like when I’m out of town, he’d just have a sandwich or chips or snacks for dinner rather than make a proper meal.

We had a few big arguments which basically resulted in us having a ‘break’ in which he said he was going to propose that year and my happiness kind of blindsided him (the usual I felt like I was putting in more effort and had felt that from the start). 

We’re now in a much better place but every day it feels like I go between having resentment almost all his friends are married or engaged (the only ones that aren’t are single) and then feeling panicked that he will propose and I have to decide. 

As a bit more info we also probably went through 6 month periods of no sex the last 2/3 years and when we did he sometimes got panicked which led to him not staying hard. It’s much better now but it just doesn’t seem as great as it used to be.

He’s mentioned counselling a few times and I also have this feeling that if we went there would be a part of me that just wants to leave the relationship.

1k66kg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1k66kg9/should_i_speak_my_mind_to_nana_on_her_deathbed/,Should I speak my mind to Nana on her deathbed,"My (25f) maternal grandmother (Linda) has never been a great person but in her mind has never done wrong and never takes accountability. She was physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive to my mother and three other children while they were growing up. However, as I grew up, my mother mended the relationship she had with Linda. As a child, I loved Linda so much and was always excited to see my ""Nana"". She often rotated on her favoritism with her grandchildren. When I was a teen, she treated me horribly, often calling me every name under the sun and creating conflict for no sound reason.
After the unexpected death of my grandma, who I was close to, I decided to let bygones be bygones to forge a new relationship with Linda so there were no regrets when she dies. We ended up being close for years. Once I got with my husband, she pestered us for years about when we were going to have children. Well, we had our daughter in December of 2023. I would try to call Linda to talk about how my pregnancy was going and the issues I was dealing with (pre-eclampsia). Never answered, never returned a call. After having my daughter, she didn't come see us once. I would try to call, no answer or call back. I would send pictures/updates of my daughter only to be met with no message (if she even looked at it). That irked me, but I just let it go. 
Skip to my paternal grandfather, he had a laundry list of medical problems. My Papas brother (Phil) is the one who took care of him. Papa would have times of delirium, one of these times he told us that Phil was out to get him. I wish we would have listened, but we all thought it was another delusion as they were so frequent and at times very outlandish. Turns out, Phil was physically abusing Papa, and Linda knew. The woman KNEW and never spoke up until after he died. My parents and I would have gotten him out of there and into our care the day we found out if she told us. She and Phil were scheming on putting Papa into a nursing home so that Phil could move in with Linda and lessen her bill burden (he has since moved in and out in a year). After that, I decided that I was done with Linda and have not reached out to her. 
My mother tried to sever her relationship with Linda also, but was met with the bombshell of Linda having cancer. My mother doesn't want Linda dying alone, which I 100% understand. Linda is shitty, but still her mom. 
Last week, Linda nearly died. Turns out she has stage 4 COPD. Mom went to hospital to talk with the doctors, and to set up arrangements with Linda. While there, Mom mentioned coming up to help rearrange Linda's house some and was met with ""Why the fuck would I do that, I like my house the way it is"". Mom explained that there will be tubes running everywhere for her oxygen, not to mention the machine itself. Mom then offered to come the following weekend to get everything straightened for when the time of passing comes, and mentioned that she will have my daughter with her. Linda said ""I love her and all, but it took me days to get my house back the way it was before she came"". I went there once with my mom and daughter to support my mom while she went to go over the cancer diagnosis. I moved five breakable things off the coffee table, and moved them back before leaving. My daughter didn't get into anything else. 
Up until this point, I have been very apathetic towards Linda. However after stating her ""love"" for my daughter,  I am angry. I let so much of the past go
I let years of anger, frustration, and disappointment go. I never spoke my mind out of respect for my mom, it's hard enough for her. Now, I want to wait until she is on her deathbed (won't be long anyways) and tell her of all the anger, disappoint, and sadness she has caused EVERYONE. Also, she doesn't love my daughter.

RAFT removed the claws, Herald got a missile rack.

I would not be surprised if CIG said this was for interns to practice.

Therefore, any idea of ​​a comprehensive remake of MSR is unrealistic, that would mean modifying the entire structure of the ship, which is too much work, and CIG will not, nor has the marketing motivation to do this.



Therefore, if CIG wants to enhance MSR, it can only choose the easiest way to achieve it.

What is the easiest thing?

\- Maneuverability and speed!

They are essentially just a string of numbers that CIG only needs to type a few times and submit to the next version. I believe it will take less than a cup of coffee.

There is no need to even let the interns practice how to modify the model.

This is also in line with the positioning of MSR. She is a ""STAR RUNNER"". She runs very fast in the story. It doesn't make sense for her to be clumsy and slow.



Well, since speed and maneuverability are the easiest to modify, how can we modify them most appropriately?

I think there are three options:



The first is a conventional gain, which increases the speed of MSR in NAV&SCM mode, making her as fast as racing speedboats such as Raven and Razor in NAV mode, and not slower than fighters such as F7A MK2 in SCM mode, and her maneuverability can be comparable to the lower-level Cutlass.

The purpose of this option is to break through the blockade.



The second is to enhance her linear acceleration, allowing her to accelerate from 0 to maximum speed in 5 seconds.

This option is to get away from danger as quickly as possible when danger comes.



The third is to customize a dedicated quantum engine for her (not removable or replaceable), just like Ares' SF7B.

In the current ranking, the larger the ship, the faster it is, and this S2 quantum engine is comparable to the Polaris S4 quantum engine in speed - or even faster.

This solution is all about saving commuting time and improving the cargo efficiency of the MSR.

It also does not require model modification. CIG only needs to lock the cabinet with the quantum engine and say ""This is the quantum engine customized by the Crusaders for the MSR"".



She doesn't need shields or firepower, she just needs speed and maneuverability.

1k66g9c,https://v.redd.it/x8iogpglnmwe1,"Pump failure, basket issue or operator error? [Delonghi EC685]","Hi all,


l've been experiencing very poor results with my machine recently. I am hoping for your advice as to whether I should persue changing the pump or whether my issues are around the grind and basket etc.


The machine itself is about 10 years old . It runs on Brita filtered hard water and has had extensive descaling cycles since this issue occurred


I'm using Volcano Works espresso ground coffee (I've tried 2 different blends now, both espresso ground). I have tried single and double shots neither produce good (or any) flow.

I have soaked the basket and filter in white vinegar and blowed out with compressed air. Also done the needle through the filter hole technique. No luck.


In the video am using 10g Puck into single shot basket. The
machine normally stops after 5 seconds and all 3 lights flash. On rare ocassions, the machine will dispense as per the video but will take a long time to produce very little coffee


Hopefully this is enough info to diagnose the fault. Let me know if I need to provide anything else


Thank you for your wisdom! ",1,1745432732.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Gonna try and keep this as concise as possible as this is happening in real time and as of now this is the status of things. Jane & Joe met working at a coffee spot a little over 2 years ago. Hit it off from the start and started falling for eachother . However both were in similar unhappy living situations/relationships. Jane had an open relationship with Mid of almost 6 years. Joe had a relationship with Fern of almost the same amount of time and an apartment together. Both leave their respective partners and the romance continues, however Joe had a small fling beforehand nothing serious and sends this fling a dick pic. 
Months down the line Jane finds out and accuses him of tainting the entire relationship and accuses him of cheating. After some time they work things out and the relationship continues but any and every fight would always circle back to this. A year and some change passes, Jane works a new job, has coworkers she enjoys and proceeds to go out with them. Leaving Joe to shoulder the responsibility of holding down the fort with dogs, house keeping, etc. Jane then starts staying out every night, not coming home, hiding things from Joe. Jane develops a crush/romance with a coworker, hiding this from Joe. She comes home to Joe saying he’s toxic, not good enough for her. They cry, talk things out and agree to spend some more time together. She doesn’t come home, turns out Jane kissed this crush
Joe is devastated and demands they end things face to face. To this day she hasn’t. What could’ve been done to prevent this? Was there any shot of saving this or did something snap in her head where she said she has to get her revenge for something Joe did before the relationship officially started and regrets. Joe has support, will move on, actually moved out. 
Adjusting is hard but the goal to happiness is there and he will do what he must to get there. But he is left pondering the question “why does she avoid me so much?”. Joe would never hurt Jane, he wants her to be happy, even if it’s not with him, but he had hoped she respected him enough to close their book together. Not leave him begging for scraps. Has anyone dealt with this before, how did you get through it?

Has anyone ever done any beekeeping there?

  
I see that AI says that ""Hawaii boasts the most productive honey bee colonies in the nation, producing twice as much honey as the national average, and is home to the world's largest queen bee producers, exporting 75% of locally reared queens to Canada and 25% to the mainland U.S. (accounting for 70% of all queens in the mainland U.S.).""

I lived on Oahu for about 5 years so I know somewhat about living in Hawaii, though I've heard big island has its own issues.

  
Im thinking big island mainly for the climate, which seems advantageous. 

  
I was looking at eventually keeping at least 300 hives, and trying to make agreements with local farmers who grow crops like macadamia nuts, watermelon, guava, and coffee, plus herb species, like mint, sage, rosemary, and thyme. 

As a commercial model, is it safe to assume that with proper training, one could make at least $300/hive? 

  
Or what is a realistic amount AFTER expenses?

1k667nr,https://i.redd.it/qx818cuwlmwe1.jpeg,I need to know if I’m overreacting,"I have been living with one of my really good friends for a little less than a year. Everything was great for a while, until recently, a string of events have happened. I was out of town with one of my best friends for 10 years. A homeless person threw trash in our yard and she sent me a picture. I replied right away and told her that was insane and to text our landlord. She gets mad at me that I did not offer to drive 4 hours home, and that I did not say thank you for dealing it right away. She told me she bought supplies and I needed to venmo her half, which I did. Fast forward to when I come home late at night and go straight to bed. A couple hours after I go to sleep, I get multiple phone calls from her and banging at my door stating that we need to talk right now about the situation. From 1 am to 5am we talked and she said she was not letting me go to bed until I said thank you. She had an entire list of everything I had ever done wrong. One of them being that I accidentally shorted her 50 cents for the supplies which ended up being $100. She ended the story by saying that during the weekend, she told one of our mutual friends that I’m lesbian (I am not). I did have work that next day, so I got about 3 hours of sleep total before having to go into work. 

A couple days later, she tells me that she’s getting a dog. She applied for it and put a deposit down when I was out of town. I was pretty against the dog considering we had never had a sit down conversation about a dog in the house. She then proceeds to tell me the reason she is getting the dog is because I am not around that much to keep her company (I have a boyfriend, I work in office 4 days a week, this is my busy season, I’ve been helping my friend plan her wedding, etc) I told her my one rule about the dog was that it cannot get on the couch since I own it and it’s a white couch. At first she agreed to this rule. 

Fast forward to when she gets the dog.  The dog is as sweet as can be, but has some separation anxiety which I get when it’s a new dog in a new environment. She then starts calling it “our dog.” I correct her and tell her that it’s her dog, since I am not putting any money into this dog, and she starts telling me that I am mean and now the dog is sad that I said that. She got very mad at me to the point that every time I would try to talk to her, she would only talk to the dog. I recommended her getting a crate for the dog so it can have a safe place while she’s at work, but she disagreed and said the dog would feel like it was punished (she also showers with the dog because she doesn’t want to keep it in her room for the same reason).

About a week goes by and she had already broken my rule about the dog on the couch, and barely talk to me. Still the same issue where every time I would talk she would start having a conversation with the dog. I started spending more time at my boyfriends since I just didn’t feel welcomed at home. She had started leaving peanut butter in the dog bowl overnight, which made the downstairs smell putrid and then out of no where started using one of my bowls as a secondary option for the dog to eat out of (don’t ask me why). We went to a comedy show together with one of our other friends and the entire time she would not look at me or make direct conversation with me. By this point, I was done trying to be her friend if she cannot even look me in the eye. 

Then comes Easter. I am spending it with my boyfriend and some family friends. She texts me and tells me that some other trash has been thrown over the fence, and since I don’t help the first time (when I was out of town) she didn’t expect me to help this time. I was taken aback from this message since she was not asking for help, she was just accusing me of already not helping. 3 hours later, she texts me that I have been a terrible person and a terrible roommate and she’s done with me, and that I spent way too much time with my boyfriend now. Personally, I had no problem with this since she has been accusing me for weeks of being a bad friend.  A couple times this week she has started unplugging my appliances like my ice maker and coffee maker so when I wake up in the morning there is no ice or coffee (which she knows i use every single day). 

Last night, I come home to a group of pictures with me cut out and thrown into the trash. These are pictures we took together over the years that were in photo frames. I was specifically cut up and thrown into the trash. I have no idea what to do anymore. Before I saw the cut out photos (attached) I had a message typed out explaining that I know we aren’t friends anymore, but we need to set boundaries to make the rest of this lease go smoothly. However, now I don’t even feel safe leaving my room let alone talking to her. I really want to get out of to get out of there and I feel like it needs to be sooner than when my lease ends in July. 

She’s been like this before. For example: my boyfriend or any other guys I have as friends are not allowed over, so they have never seen my place. Recently, I have noticed that my mail isn’t being delivered. I had a credit card go missing, a letter from my mom, a save the date, and a birthday invitation. All of them have been marked delivered but they aren’t in our mailbox.  My friends think she is being obsessive and frankly a little crazy.  Any thoughts on how to deal with this? Or give me your opinion on the entire situation. ",10,1745432149.0,roommateproblems,14,1.0,False
