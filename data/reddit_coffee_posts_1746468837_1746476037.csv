1kflk0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kflk0e/explore_if_keurig_kelite_is_the_ultimate/,Explore if Keurig K-Elite is the ultimate single-serve brewer in our review!,"The Keurig K-Elite Single Serve Coffee Maker, model number K-Elite, has found its way into my daily routine, turning what used to be a chaotic morning sprint into a calm, caffeine-filled start to the day. Being someone who treasures that first cup of coffee, I’ve tested this machine thoroughly over the past month to see if it lived up to its extensive list of features and the hype surrounding it. Let me share my experiences—both the good and the not-so-good—so you can decide if this brewer fits your life as perfectly as it fits mine.  

**Striking Design and Build Quality**  
This machine boasts a brushed slate finish that adds a touch of modernity to my kitchen counter. Its compact dimensions (9.9""D x 13.1""W x 12.7""H) mean it doesn’t hog precious counter space. Despite its lightweight body of 6.6 pounds, it feels sturdy and well-made. I particularly love the textured, metallic aesthetic that matches my stainless-steel appliances seamlessly. Even my somewhat clumsy roommate managed not to leave dents or scratches on its surface—a win for durability in my book.

**User-Friendly Features**  
The user interface is refreshingly simple. With buttons for brewing size, strength control, and even an iced coffee setting, anyone in my household can operate it without a PhD in kitchen gadgets. I also discovered that its fully automated operation mode gets things rolling with minimal supervision. Programming the auto-on function meant I could set it up the night before, and voilà, the aroma of coffee greeted me each morning. Keurig really nailed it with intuitive usability here.  

**What I Love About the Brewing Flexibility**  
This machine brews multiple cup sizes—4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 ounces—which came in handy on days when I needed just a quick pick-me-up or, conversely, a survival-sized mug for deadlines. The bold-tasting output from the Strong Brew button has been a favorite feature; it really ramps up the intensity for those mornings when my brain needs a little extra jolting. The Iced Setting is another gem. I wasn’t expecting much from it, but surprisingly, it delivers ice coffee without that watered-down taste—ideal for summer afternoons.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
Speed is where this single-serve brewer truly shines. Coffee gets brewed in just under two minutes—impressive for someone who’s always in a rush. Its 75-ounce removable water reservoir saved me from the daily drudgery of refilling. This kept mornings stress-free, especially when brewing multiple cups back-to-back during family brunches or when friends dropped by. Throw in the hot water on-demand feature, and even tea-loving members of my family found utility in this machine—it was an unexpected yet delightful bonus!  

**Perks**  
- Multiple brewing sizes cater to big and small cravings alike.  
- Strong Brew button intensifies flavor seamlessly.  
- Effortless iced coffee that’s not diluted.  
- Quick and efficient, perfect for busy schedules.  

**Shortcomings**  
- I’ve noticed the machine doesn’t run very quietly—a minor irritation during peaceful mornings.  
- While neatness isn’t usually its issue, the removable drip tray’s capacity to hold accidental brews could’ve been slightly larger.  
- It doesn’t include the My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter, a separately sold accessory mandatory for brewing with your grounds. At this price point, adding one would've made the experience feel even more complete.  

**Competing Brands and Market Rivals**  
Comparing this to my earlier Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, I could see some critical differences. For instance, the Keurig K-Elite outperforms its rivals with the sheer variety in cup sizes and brew options. However, Hamilton Beach includes a built-in single-server scoop for coffee grounds at its base price—a convenience I missed here unless I wanted to spend extra on Keurig’s reusable filter. Nevertheless, when comparing the sleek design and overall user experience, the Keurig machine feels like an upgrade that’s well worth considering if you drink a lot of coffee.  

**Value Assessment**  
Considering its myriad features, the Keurig K-Elite offers reasonable value for money. The programmable functions, coupled with versatility for both hot and iced drinks, ensure it serves more than just coffee drinkers. If you like options and you’re someone who values convenience without sacrificing brewing quality, it’s hard to fault this brewer on price-to-quality ratio. While not the cheapest option around, it does strike a good balance between luxury features and everyday practicality.

1kfljck,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kfljck/i_think_im_done/,I think I’m done,"We been together 5 years now and have a 3 year old. We didn’t plan a child but she was going to keep it whether I was around or not and I couldn’t live with myself knowing I have a child out there somewhere so I bit the bullet and we accepted our responsibility as about to be parents 

She’s a vet and we agreed that it would be more stable for us to open a clinic rather then me selling software for startups and having to change jobs every few years as these types of companies do sell and they did twice while I was working and had to find another job every time 

Then we had our first fight and instead of dealing with it together she messaged her friend how she doesn’t think we love each other but “oh well, who else will open a clinic for me” this absolutely killed me and I realised what a huge red flag this was. But I was thinking maybe we can work together on our relationship and work through this. 

So then it’s time to meet her parents and her mum comes over to visit. I scrubbed my whole apartment with her, helped her with cooking and watched movies with her trying to get to know her. I bought her a nice mother Mary painting since she’s catholic and she looked me dead in the eye and said to me “you need this more me then me” to which in my head I instantly thought to myself “oh so your a bitch?!” But I didn’t say anything 

My partner takes me to go drive a car we could not buy. I’m trying to explain this to her but she’s convinced she can get it. Of course she doesn’t and it just made me angry because it was such a waste of time but as soon as we get home I hear her mum yelling how I’m angry because of my race and that’s how we all are. And my daughter will never be a doctor like her daughter because of her race. I’ve never kicked someone out of my house so fast before but she was out of there. 

I realised every time my partner jokes about my culture it’s actually coming from a deep engrained racism and it means whenever she makes a comment I see it in a completely different light and it bothers me. I don’t mind racial jokes I just know the difference between making fun of something and being an actual racist 

I was sober for 3 years and my partner randomly comes home from work telling me her nurses brother cooked a bucket of crack and then lied for 4 days about it which completely made me flip mentally because I couldn’t believe how she could just say something like this. 

I asked her not to feed my dog a million times and she comes out and feeds her heavy raw garlic sausages. At that point I’m so tired of her I’m just thinking in my head how I’m so sick of her ignoring me and then my dog died in my arms from poisoning. 

My friend came to visit from NZ and when he arrived my partner made him a tinder account and started swiping. I said one girl was pretty and she slapped me in front of him calling me an unemployed gypsy

Another friend came to visit and she doesn’t like him so when he greeted her she just completely ignored him and he fealt so bad I’ve never seen him since 

People have messaged me telling me they feel sorry for me and I’ve never been in this position before it’s so weird.

She sat at a table with strangers and told the 2 youngest girls there that they look older than her. The whole table stopped to look at her like wtf did u just say? It was so embarrassing 

An old lady asked for a coffee and she pat her on the stomach and told her to make it herself that she needs the exercise

You locked the key inside the house and while I’m calling the locksmith your yelling at me and then drive off leaving my and my child outside in the cold 

You sleep in the same clothes and socks for 3 days without even putting on Pajamas and it’s actually disgusting. Then you come down and ask why I never wasn’t to give you a foot rub and it takes everything in me not to puke

After my child brings me my partners phone and it has someone’s random dick pic on it. I told her to go to her mums with the little one so we don’t fight infront of her because I was ready to leave at that point. What bothered me is that she sent the picture to the same friend she complains about me too and they were just having a laugh and my partner clearly enjoyed receiving that picture. If she has just told me nothing would have happened but she just couldn’t understand this 

So then she’s at her mums and her mum decides to throw a surprise birthday party for my child 1 month early just to sort of put it in my face that she will have the special party there and she will have the second one here. When I messaged my partner like wtf couldn’t you have given me a heads up? She said I should just talk to her mum about it and she stayed there for another week not wanting to come home pretty much holding my child hostage there 

She then got a message from some guys in the city and she said she might go there with her friend. I found the messages and her response was maybe you should have treated me better…. 

I hate that this is the type of female role model my child will have and my partner has confessed that she is struggling with her relationship with her child because she looks like me. The little one was sick and coughing like crazy while her mum is yelling at her to stop coughing instead of giving her syrup which I did straight away 

Fuck I’m exhausted I can’t wait till my business is up and running so I can get my own place

1kflih6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1kflih6/my_wife_ended_our_marriage_over_the_phone_after_i/,My wife ended our marriage over the phone after I pushed for clarity. I feel erased.,"We were married, but lived apart for most of our relationship while she pursued her PhD in another city. I live abroad—8,000 km from home and everyone I know. For years, I supported her emotionally and financially: helping her move, setting up housing, paying for travel, planning trips. I did this while dealing with my own constant crises—my father was diagnosed with cancer, my dog died, I was laid off several times, and our apartment flooded. I was also living in a foreign country without a support network.

Her parents never accepted me. They questioned my intentions, withheld support, and made me feel like I was using her for a passport. I kept waiting for her to stand up for us. To set boundaries. She didn’t. I felt like I had to carry everything and beg for her to meet me there. It was exhausting.

For a while, I lived in her old student apartment with her teenage sister. It was disgusting. I cleaned constantly, shopped for groceries, tried to create order in chaos. Her father dropped off broken furniture he didn’t want and left it with us, making things worse. When I found a new apartment that I hoped would be our future home, he tried to block the lease transfer because he didn’t want to be financially responsible for his younger daughter. Bills kept bouncing from my wife’s account for over a year, even though she hadn’t lived there. Her sister wouldn’t transfer them into her own name.

Meanwhile, my family stepped up. My mom gave her a ring for our wedding. My grandmother gave us money to secure a flat. I paid for our elopement. When she visited my family, they covered everything. Her family, in four years, maybe bought me dinner twice. When I first met them—on her birthday—her father made me and her friend pay for lunch.

I asked her four months in advance to come visit my family for Christmas in 2023. At the time, my dad was undergoing chemo with a stoma bag for colon cancer. I was worried we wouldn’t get too many times together with my parents. Her parents refused to board their dog because her dad didn’t want to pay for it. They expected her to watch the dog. Still, they were indecisive about their travel plans, so I accepted that she couldn’t come. Then, at the last minute, they cancelled their trip—and she could come after all, but only because I bought her a terrible last-minute flight.

Through all of this, I was unraveling. I lost 40 kg. I stayed sober for five years. I tried to heal from past abusive relationships. I worked full-time, studied for a master’s degree, tried to learn the local language. I didn’t have time to make friends or build community. I struggled with intimacy and being touched. I know she needed more affection and physical presence than I could give.

And I became deeply resentful. I felt like I was doing everything—holding the relationship up while she stayed passive. I began to criticize her. I criticized her appearance when she wasn’t taking care of herself. I criticized her interests when they felt immature or disconnected from reality. I criticized her friends and her dynamic with her family when she avoided setting boundaries or taking initiative. I was frustrated that she seemed to live in a bubble of avoidance while I was drowning in logistics, financial stress, and grief. She asked me to stop. I didn’t. I own that. I was unkind at times, and I regret it. But it didn’t come from hatred—it came from desperation. I wanted her to show up. I wanted her to grow up. I didn’t know how else to express how abandoned I felt.

When she went to Brazil for research this winter, I felt her pull away. I asked if we were okay. She said we were. She told me she loved me.

When she returned from Brazil, we saw each other. That first weekend was awkward, but we had a good time. We were intimate. I apologized and told her I wanted to work on things. I said I took responsibility for the breakdown. I meant it. I tried to be more action-oriented instead of just talking. I sent her a blanket as a small gift—something we always fought over when we shared her tiny one. I wanted to show her I was listening and growing.

She stayed emotionally closed off. She spent weeks with family and friends, clearly trying to figure out what she wanted—but she kept telling me she loved me. Meanwhile, I had just lost my job. I was in a mental health crisis. I started self-harming, couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat. I drank for the first time in five years. I ended up at the ER for psychiatric help. I was calling my mom just to cry, saying “Mommy, help me.” I’ve never done that in my life. When I told her this, she said I was being too intense, that I was choking and suffocating her. She was totally detached when I said I was at the hospital and to calm down. That everything would be okay.

We were supposed to spend Easter together. But after a three-hour phone call with her mom, she canceled and went to see her parents instead. I told her I couldn’t take another three weeks of separation. I had only seen her five days in three months. So, we had a virtual date, cooked and watched a movie together. It was nice.

That Easter weekend, I stayed with distant relatives. On Sunday, I asked to talk. She agreed, then delayed the conversation twice. Finally, on Easter Monday, I waited by the phone, heart pounding. She slept in. Had coffee. Eventually we got on a call and she casually told me about her weekend. I was holding back tears.

I asked how she felt about us. She was cold. Detached. She said “the same” in a flat voice. It felt impersonal and strange. So I called her back on FaceTime.

I said:
“I don’t know how to ask this… but do you love me?”
She said no. That she realized in Brazil she wasn’t in love with me anymore.
I asked if she wanted to be with me. She said no.
I asked if she wanted to stay married. She said no.

We talked for an hour. Then I had to leave—my ride was waiting to take me back into the city.

Later that day, we spoke again. Her answer was still the same: she didn’t love me, didn’t want to be with me, didn’t want to stay married.

I called my parents and said:
“I can’t gaslight myself for one more day. If I stay in this pain, I’ll end up in the psych ward.”
They bought me an emergency plane ticket home the next morning.

The next day, she erased me—deleted me from social media, disappeared.

Now she’s out partying like nothing happened. And I’m here—back in my home country, humiliated, heartbroken, and trying to understand how a marriage ends like this. How someone says they love you one week and throws you away the next.

I know I wasn’t perfect. I’ve looked at myself closely. But I loved her. I tried. I carried everything I could. I just don’t know how to make sense of what happened. It feels like the person I married never really existed. It feels like I was erased.

Has anyone else experienced something like this?

I don't know if this is the perfect place to post this, but I've been enjoying a natural and low-maintenance outlook toward beauty and personal care. I love it. I take care of myself with good soap, lotion, etc, but I don't do anything to ""enhance"" my appearance, aside from wearing a bit of lipstick or eyeliner on a rare special occasion. 

I like those, in particular, because they aren't ""obscuring"" a perceived flaw, but only complimenting my features (and I do them in such a way that it's obvious makeup work for ornamental reasons, not trying to obscure my actual appearance.)

I have no interest in altering my appearance cosmetically for reasons that aren't absolutely necessary; I was really insecure forever, and now I've blanket-decided that I like my face, hair and body, and I like them how they are. 

That being said, my mom is--very well-intentionally--pushing for me to whiten my teeth. I don't want to; my teeth are a little yellow, but they look like the teeth of someone who likes coffee and tea, which is accurate, and I see no reason to pretend otherwise. It seems unnecessary and dishonest, to me. Also, my teeth are naturally very sensitive and finicky, I already struggle with temperature and sweetness despite having generally healthy teeth.

Alright, friends, let’s get real for a minute. How many of us wake up each day with a thousand things to do, only to spend the entire day putting out fires? 🙄 You know what I mean—the email that just can’t wait, the friend who desperately needs advice, or the dog that decided today was the day to chew your favorite shoe. 

**Sound familiar?** Instead of being the proactive star of our own show, we often find ourselves stuck in the background, on auto-pilot, just reacting to whatever life throws our way. **Here’s the kicker:** it doesn’t have to be this way!

You might be telling yourself, “But I’ve tried time blocking!” 🙈 Maybe you even watched that super inspirational YouTube video and it seemed so easy! But at the end of the day, you still feel overwhelmed. That’s why I’m here to share something new with you: **Energy Anchors.** 💪

**So, what the heck are Energy Anchors?** Think of them as your personal GPS for energy management throughout the day, guiding you to tackle tasks when you’re feeling your best. Instead of rigidly scheduling your day, you align your tasks with your energy levels. It’s all about working smarter, not harder, right?

**Here’s how you can get started:**

1. **Know Your Energy Peaks 🌅**
   - Are you a morning person or a night owl? Track when you naturally feel most energized and ready to tackle challenges.
   - Use a simple journal or app to log your energy levels for a week. Trust me, it’s eye-opening!

2. **Match Tasks to Energy Levels 📊**
   - Big creative project? Schedule it for when you’re buzzing with energy.
   - Routine tasks like emails or admin work? Do them during your low-energy times. 

3. **Create Rituals Around Your Peaks 🔄**
   - Begin your morning with something energizing—like movement or a favorite song—to set the tone.
   - In the afternoon slump? Maybe a quick walk or a cup of coffee to recharge.

4. **Set Up Energy Donors & Drainers ⚡️**
   - Identify people or tasks that fuel your energy (energy donors) and those that drain it (energy drainers).
   - Surround yourself with energy givers when you need motivation!

5. **Be Flexible, Not Rigid 🔄**
   - Life happens! Don’t beat yourself up if things don’t go as planned. Adjust and pivot based on your energy anchors without guilt.

**And hey, let’s sprinkle in some humor!** Ever tried to nail a presentation when your brain feels like mashed potatoes? That’s the worst! 🍽️ It’s like trying to cook a gourmet meal without any ingredients. By aligning your tasks with your natural energy, you can serve up some serious productivity.

Imagine going through your day *actually feeling accomplished* instead of tired and reactive. Picture taking a moment to savor your progress instead of feeling stressed about what’s next on the never-ending list. 

So, what do you think? Do you struggle with trying to force productivity? Have you ever used Energy Anchors, or are you ready to give it a shot? Maybe you have your own tips to share! Let’s keep this convo going! 🌟",1,1746475340.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

We come from the same culture and even lived together for a year earlier in our friendship, been friends for a few years now.

When we first become friends, we got along really well and spent a lot of time together, a lot of which involved partying & drinking (I’m sober now but still like going out). We consider eachother best friends. I really like her, but I feel like certain instances have made me think about some things.

We don’t see eachother often and usually when we do, she will invite others. Sometimes she won’t mention anything about it prior and will let me know after, sometimes she lets me know prior in a way of being like there’s nothing she can do for the other person not to come. This goes for plans that either I or her plan, not just times that she planned herself if that makes sense. Honestly it drives me nuts because then I feel like I can’t talk freely and there’s always someone that I barely know, sometimes someone she even barely knows, there with us. We don’t see eachother often so I just felt like it hasn’t been worth mentioning.

Recently, for my bday, we were supposed to have a girls night just me and her. Long story short that did not really happen, and it was involving other guys. I am getting engaged this year, in no world would I want to hangout with dudes past midnight on a girls night for my birthday, especially someone I have never met before. She just wanted to spend the whole night with them, and I spent most of the night alone upstairs in her room because honestly it felt really weird and the guy I didn’t know kept making inappropriate jokes, including a really bad one about me. They also left at some point as well throughout the night. Earlier she said she felt like she didn’t have a choice, but honestly it did not feel like that at all.

Honestly I did act like I was totally chill with everything, I felt I couldn’t say anything in the morning either because she invited one of them to get coffee with us… I just kept feeling like why am I here and I should’ve just gone home the night before.

I just feel like I’m struggling to find the value in our friendship anymore. It just feels like we are in this loop of plans never working either because she bails last minute or she invites others all of a sudden.

The issue is that I’m getting married next year. Last time we were together, she brought it up in front of this girl we were with, and they sprung into a full discussion about what the girl should wear, where I should have my bachelorette, etc. I’ve only met this girl twice! I just kinda sat there. Marriages are a huge deal in our culture (me and her are the same culture), and my partners family is so accepting of me and are overlooking a lot of not great circumstances I have going on my life right now, and I in no way want anything to jeopardize this. I was only planning on inviting her and 2 other of my very close friends and have already been feeling bad about leaving out other people that I do know.

Let me preface with even my mother is not attending, and potentially not my father based on their own circumstances. This is a very sensitive time for me and I just wanted people I truly trust to be there. I feel like it’s too close to the events for me to not invite her, and I feel so bad because I’m harboring these feelings and haven’t mentioned anything. I just feel like I’m in a weird position.

Also, her family is slightly slightly slightly connected to someone who’s connected to my bfs family. I’m also not trying to start a larger weirdness, but tbh with everything else piled up I feel like I would’ve ended my friendship with her sooner had she been anyone else. I feel like she does like me and care for me, but perhaps we are just in very different places.

I just don’t want randoms attending the events, especially people who might get too drunk and say something to anyone IDK the thought of it is just stressing me out and I don’t want to deal with it. Also conflicted because she did invite me to attend her relatives events a few years back, so I feel like maybe I’m not being fair.

Anyway that said, I feel horrible for feeling like this, I just feel fed up with some of the stuff she does at this point. My boyfriend said it’s completely up to me how I want to go about it (his family is hosting all the events pretty much). Also, there was a period of time where she didn’t really like my boyfriend which was valid at the time, but I’m not sure how much has been shared with others in her life. I do know that she does tell a lot to others ( I deeply regret opening up about certain things but I was also pretty young). I feel like I should invite her, but am almost wanting to say please do not just invite anyone to attend stuff, especially not the intimate events (like the bachelorette). Especially people she says herself she doesn’t like or trust much, but continues to invite to tag along for things. Is it reasonable to mention this? I just feel so conflicted and feel like I’m causing issues for no reason.

To the bigger events it’s more so fine, but the intimate events with people I barely know at my house is just not for me. AITA for asking her not to invite others to the intimate events, and potentially not to the bigger events??? I was thinking of inviting her sister to the bigger events too but idk",1,1746475193.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

It’s comforting, a bit quaint, and honestly sometimes the highlight of my day if they make it right

1kfl9uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1kfl9uf/what_makes_ivicy_linen_car_seat_cover_review/,What Makes IVICY Linen Car Seat Cover Review Stand Out for Comfort and Style?,"The **IVICY LN-2020** Linen Car Seat Cover landed on my radar after countless battles with coffee spills and pet fur turning my car's interior into a chaotic fabric jungle. Testing this protective cover firsthand added a layer of both comfort and style to my daily drives, but as with anything, there are things to weigh before committing. This review dives into the nitty-gritty of its standout points, quirks, and if it’s worth parking on your car seat.

**Design and Material Quality**  
Immediately after unboxing, the linen fabric gave off a vibe of understated luxury. Its neutral beige tone matched effortlessly with my car’s interior, blending in like it was meant to be there. The material feels soft to the touch, breathable, and promises durability. While it won't win any awards for unique texture, its simplicity gives it a universal appeal. I particularly love how the breathable fabric stayed cool even after hours of a summer road trip—a perk not guaranteed with synthetic materials. But, if you're someone looking for a pop of vibrant color, the beige might not carry enough pizzazz.  

**Ease of Installation**  
Getting this seat cover onto my car seat was as straightforward as they promised. With some car accessories, installing them feels like an episode of a bad reality show—flipping, tugging, and secretly considering setting the whole thing on fire. This, however, was a breeze. The adjustable straps hugged my seat snugly, and the non-slip backing ensured it stayed firmly in place, even with my restless dog jumping around. My main gripe? It took a few trial-and-error moments to align the cover perfectly without wrinkles. If you'd rather avoid a minor wrestling match, take your time during the alignment process.

[Ready to snag IVICY LN-2020? See Amazon’s price.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b089gtwrwf/)

**Comfort and Usability**  
Driving long distances often leaves me fidgeting, pulling or adjusting seat covers. Not this time. The cover’s ergonomic design added just enough padding to make my daily commute feel a tad luxurious. In both winter’s chill and summer’s sweat-inducing heat, the fabric maintained a pleasant temperature. Plus, it’s soft and inviting—my teenage son now volunteers to ride shotgun more often (a rare occurrence). For those sharing their car with furry friends, shedding becomes less of an issue. Quick confession: cleaning up hair or dirt involved nothing more than a quick wipe.  

**Versatility and Fit**  
The universal fit is one of this product's major wins for me. From SUVs to sedans, the design adapts to various seat shapes, as advertised. I tested it on two different vehicles, a compact sedan and a bulkier SUV, and it fit seamlessly on both. That said, while the cover claims to fit nearly all models, users with heavily customized or contoured seats may find this a slightly imperfect match.

**Advantages**  
- The linen material is soft, breathable, and comfortable in extreme weather conditions.  
- Non-slip back ensures the cover stays in place even during bumpy rides or with pets.  
- Simple installation saves time and frustration.  
- Machine washable for effortless cleaning—a lifesaver for spills or pet accidents.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The beige color, while versatile, might not cater to those who love bold, chic car interiors.  
- Wrinkle-free alignment during setup can be tricky without patience.  
- While versatile, custom car seat shapes or heavily padded seats may not achieve a perfect fit.  

**Market Rivals**  
Looking at alternatives, there are a few key players this product contends with. Brands like FH Group and BDK offer similar universal seat covers. FH Group gives customizable aesthetics with a wider palette of colors and patterns, but lacks the breathability of linen. On the other hand, BDK offers a more budget-friendly option, though their materials feel noticeably thinner in quality. The IVICY cover stakes its claim in being a more luxurious, soft, and eco-friendly option without swaying toward overly premium pricing. In scenarios where durability and comfort trump aesthetics, IVICY pulls ahead of competitors.

**Worth Every Penny**  
The asking price for the cover falls squarely between affordable and premium. You’re not getting something cheap and flimsy—this shows in the stitching, non-slip technology, and breathable fabric. While some alternatives may seem cheaper at first glance, the quality compromises usually start showing with wear-and-tear after a few months. Based on how much I drive—and the abuse my car interior has faced—I’d say this cover brings value through longevity and purpose. Whether you view this as a long-term investment for leather seat protection or simply an aesthetic upgrade, the price and perks align well.

1kfl963,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1kfl963/am_i_wrong/,Am I wrong,"I have been married for three years and have two teenage children from my previous marriage.
My current marriage has been a rocky road to try to make work, but I do feel like there has been progress .
One of my biggest challenges with my current husband and most painful experiences is he tends to be very selfish. There are times that he admits it but most of the time in the heat of arguments he defend his behavior. He will often blame something I said or dead on the reasons why he does what he does. And I know that I’m not a perfect person and maybe don’t handle those arguments very well, but I don’t really feel like his behavior is because of something I’ve said or done.
Most recently right before a family vacation I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I received that information through a chart message sent to my phone in the evening and obviously I was devastated and scared. The next morning I got up early and made coffee and sat in my living room and was obviously very upset and tearful and scared. My husband stayed in bed until about 10 o’clock Internet, surfing and didn’t come out until hours after I had been up.
Our vacation went fairly well and immediately the day that we got back, I was sitting down, trying to plan our financial future, knowing this is going to be financially devastating for us. And in the midst of that, he asked if he could go hang out with one of his buddies and play one a hobby game.  
I was very upset about this, but I did remain calm because I was more hurt than anything and I told him I found that very upsetting that I’m dealing with this new diagnosis, haven’t had time to process it. I’m trying to figure out how we’re gonna survive, and his priority was to hang out with his friend.   
He blew up and basically accuse me of being controlling and dictating his life and stormed off and went to his parents house and proceeded to rant about me.  The week prior I had posted on Facebook about my diagnosis and tagged my husband in it, and also he was sitting next to me when I posted it and I asked him if it was ok. He said yes. During his rant his mom stated that she was hurt that I didn’t include my husband’s name in that post. And so she did not reach out to me about my cancer diagnosis for approximately two weeks because she was quite afraid of what she might say to me. We had never had any sort of disagreement or issues before and I always thought we had a good relationship. But apparently that was really upsetting to her because I didn’t specifically mention his name. My guess is it has a lot to do with the things that he was saying to her that day.
To try to summarize and not make this post longer than what it is there have been some discussions and argument since then, and I feel very hurt and betrayed that I literally have cancer have started chemo therapy, had horrible side effects, my hair is falling out,  and need a bilateral mastectomy and we are still fighting about my supposed selfishness when I feel like they have demonstrated inexcusable selfishness.  I’m also very hurt that he has not defended me to his mom. He only complained about me and the worst moments of my life and made it about him and her feelings. I’m just not sure I could ever get past this. I don’t claim to be perfect, but I’m really struggling to wrap my brain around this in the mist of trying to survive the treatments. 
What do I do? I’m a grown adult and part of me thinks this is so inexcusable and the other part thanks maybe I should let him hang out with his friends if that’s where he would rather be. Why beg for him to love me when I needed him most.  I’m also sick and in treatment so it makes jt more complicated. ",1,1746475059.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False
1kfl8m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kfl8m6/cmv_window_seat_is_superior/,CMV: Window seat is superior,"I was recently browsing subs like r/travel and r/flying, and I noticed something surprising: a majority of people seem to prefer the aisle seat over the window seat on flights. I genuinely don’t understand this and think the window seat is clearly better. Here’s why:

**1. The bathroom excuse doesn’t hold up.**  
A lot of people say the aisle seat is better because you don’t have to bother anyone when you need to use the bathroom. But... why are people going to the bathroom so often during a flight? Unless you have a medical issue or drank six cups of coffee at the airport, you should be able to hold it for a couple of hours. Go before the flight takes off and you're good for a while.

**2. If you** ***do*** **need to go, just go.**  
Yes, you might disturb the person in the aisle seat. But that’s a known trade-off for sitting there—they're signing up for being the human door. Plus, disturbing someone for a few seconds is not the end of the world.

**3. It’s worse to** ***be*** **disturbed than to** ***disturb*** **someone else.**  
Say you’re in the aisle seat and you just managed to fall asleep. The person in the window seat needs to pee, so now you have to wake up, move, and try to fall asleep again. Then they come back—another interruption. Maybe the middle seat guy also wants to get up. That’s a miserable experience. In contrast, the person in the window seat might briefly feel bad for asking, but then they get to go back to their peaceful little corner and keep relaxing.

**4. You can still stretch or walk around from the window seat.**  
Another argument I saw was that the aisle seat makes it easier to get up and stretch or walk around—especially on long-haul flights. Sure, that’s true... but nothing is stopping you from doing that in the window seat too. You just ask, wait a second, and go. Again, it's a minor inconvenience *for the aisle person*, not for you.

**5. The window seat gives you more privacy, better sleep, and a view.**  
You're as far from people as you can get on a plane, you can lean against the wall to sleep, and you have something to look at. You don’t have people brushing past you constantly, or flight attendants knocking your elbow with the cart. It’s more peaceful. And if you're a little introverted or just tired, it’s the best place to zone out.

So yeah, I really don’t understand the aisle seat preference. The arguments mostly seem to revolve around avoiding minor inconveniences by accepting bigger ones.",3,1746475022.0,changemyview,17,0.62,False

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/qTOZIaO)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?

Initially found this movie on a preview for another one. Another reason I find this hobby enjoyable, the previews. It helps a younger guy like myself to expand in the vast world of Hollywood. Back to this movie. It came out before Entourage and the Ari Gold character. Before people where so transparent if an actor was being complete morbid in their day to day life. Of course it’s a satire, often times over the top but the message is clearly stated. What will someone put up with in the process of a better future? This character gets coffee thrown at him, yelled at constantly and ridiculed for what he simply forgot to do. So then it comes with no surprise that Spacey gets tied up and tortured for his actions. 
My take away: to beat the person you have to become the person.

I'm 22 and come from a conservative family where traditional gender roles are very much the norm (I strive to be completely independent and usally do everything on my own) my mom handles the cooking, cleaning, and home-related tasks, while my dad works in construction. I'm currently in university and have worked part-time alongside my studies.

Here's where my conflict starts:  
My dad expects me to take over a lot of the household tasks, especially when my mom isn't available. He often asks me to prepare meals, set the table, bring him things (even if they’re literally within reach), make his coffee, or even do his bed so he can sleep. On top of that, I help him with paperwork etc.  Meanwhile, my brother is never expected to help in the same way.

Lately, I’ve started feeling irritated and overwhelmed. Even small requests make me tense up. I try to remind myself that he has supported me in many ways.He’s allowed me to focus on school, and he does have a good heart. But I can’t help but feel like I’m being treated differently.

Recently, I’ve pulled back a bit and stopped jumping up every time he asks for something. Interestingly, he’s started doing a lot more on his own but he also made it very clear to my mom and me that he thinks I’m being disrespectful. I don’t want to be seen that way, but I also don’t think it’s fair that I’m expected to act like a second caregiver just because I’m his daughter.

So I guess my question is:

  
**Am I overreacting? Should I try harder to accept his cultural expectations, or are my feelings valid and worth standing up for?**



I just feel emotionally drained sometimes, and it’s starting to affect how I view my relationship with him. Any honest thoughts or similar experiences are welcome. Thanks :)",0,1746474174.0,FamilyIssues,0,0.5,False

1kfkv1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/of24/comments/1kfkv1k/the_japanese_game_preservation_society_needs_help/,The Japanese Game Preservation Society needs help,"If you care about the history of video games, you need to know what’s happening to the Japanese Game Preservation Society (GPS). Since 2011, this non-profit has quietly done the work that most of the industry ignores: preserving thousands of Japanese games-including countless fragile floppy disks now decades past their intended lifespan-as well as magazines, books, and other media. Their honorary members are legends: Tomohiro Nishikado (Space Invaders), Yuzo Koshiro (Streets of Rage), Yoshio Kiya (Dragon Slayer), and Tokihiro Naito (Hydlide). But despite this star-studded support, GPS is on the verge of shutting down for good.

The Realities of Preservation Work

Preserving video game history is not glamorous. It’s time-consuming, expensive, and rarely profitable. While the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) in the US has achieved some visibility and funding, GPS operates on a shoestring. To put it in perspective, the VGHF founder’s modest salary is almost as large as GPS’s entire annual budget. Every penny GPS receives is accounted for in their newsletters-yet, their February 2025 newsletter has only two downloads as of April.

And that’s a shame, because the newsletter is packed with gold: interviews with industry pioneers like Dragon Quest’s Kouichi Nakamura, deep dives into 1980s programming contests, and features on the preservation of mobile games-an area where GPS has led the way. The lack of engagement isn’t for lack of trying; outreach is tough when only one core member speaks native English, and press releases often go ignored.

A Vicious Funding Cycle

GPS does receive some government funding, but it’s a double-edged sword. Subsidies can only be used for salaries-not rent, electricity, equipment, or the games themselves. To use government money, GPS has to spend money it doesn’t have, creating a paradox where subsidies actually cost them more than they bring in. With current funds depleted, GPS isn’t even eligible for new subsidies.

Industry Support and Missed Opportunities

GPS has worked with publishers like Nihon Falcom to preserve rare titles, meticulously documenting artifacts before they vanish forever. They’ve produced high-quality documentaries on unsung heroes like Yuuichi Toyama (Herzog) and Rika Suzuki (J.B. Harold, Hotel Dusk), subtitled in English and free to watch-yet neither has broken 10,000 views. Even when GPS tried to raise emergency funds by auctioning rare items, Japanese law forced them to use Yahoo! Auctions, effectively locking out most international collectors.

Why Does This Happen?

Part of the problem is the legal environment. As a Japanese NPO, GPS faces strict laws that limit its fundraising and outreach options, unlike its US counterparts. Even selling off rare items is fraught with red tape. The organization has even had to defend itself to its own board for spending small amounts on foreign press coverage that failed to move the needle.

Why Should You Care?

If GPS disappears, so does a vast, irreplaceable archive of Japanese games and related media-much of which exists nowhere else. The industry has shown little interest in safeguarding its own legacy, and the work of GPS is often invisible to the wider world.

They don’t need a miracle, just a few hundred supporters willing to give the price of a coffee each month. If you value game history, please consider spreading the word, subscribing to their newsletter, watching their documentaries, or becoming a supporter. The future of Japanese gaming heritage is on the line-and it’s up to us to help save it.

Process on an elm slab as a coffee table: I sanded down an existing finish to bare wood, stained it with a liberal pre conditioner wipe down, saturating the wood. Then I applied 60% ‘green’ paint thinner and 40% oil based stain. Waited 4 hours, and then wiped on a thorough but not too heavy coat of 100% tung oil. Didn’t thin the tung as the board was already saturated with the pre coat and stain. Smelled strongly of solvents, and the milky ‘green’ thinner I had isn’t good to mix with tung.

I then waited a day. Did another prep & then thorough wipe on with 100% tung, without pooling or other issues, with moderate pressure on the rag. Not quite buffing, but some pressure. Now it’s about two and a half days later with almost no smell and I wanted to apply another coat. It needs a thick, hard finish.

1kfktq1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kfktq1,"Obesity, mental health struggles [36] to fitness, stage performance [37]","Just re-publishing this because my previous post was flagged due to inappropriate image.

I was 75 kg last year in March 2024 and was struggling with mental health so I was on a year-long therapy. The context behind my mental health struggle is a long story so I'll spare it. I'm now 48kg and to help the community, here's what I did. Remember, just because something works for me doesn't mean it'll work for you.

**March 2024:** I had extremely poor eating habits, had poor self-image and no confidence. The hoody photo is from March 2024 when dropping off my parents at Heathrow Airport.

**March 2024 - July 2024:** Started cycling so went from 75 kg to 73kg. But I was slammed by a moving bus while cycling so I'm yet to gain my courage be on bike again.

**July 2024 - August 2024:** Got a personal trainer. Paid about £420/month. I'd train with him for 3 days a week at 5 AM, and then will be on a low carb diet all day. Returned home and started with small steps with 1KG dumb bells to do upper body exercise and some lower body.

**August 2024 - Dec 2024:** Continued training with PT, and then cardio (at least 2 hrs of walk every day, and 3hrs over the weekend). Combined it with increased weight training. For upper body, I just figured out what works for me - L-shaped bicep exercises, and then for lower body: mountain climber, leg raises, ankle taps, Russian twists. At this point, I phased out of coffee, processed sugary desserts and daily biryani marathon - I found it painful and replacing coffee with green tea was discomforting.

**Jan 2025 - Now:** Discontinued PT as I could no longer afford it. Replaced it with 200kcal stairmasters every weekend, 48 sets of combined upper body and lower body exercise - I do supersets, and fasted workout broken with high-protein, moderate-fat, low-carb diet.

**Here are some key things I learned:**

1. All these doesn't matter unless you have calorie deficit. You need to burn more calories than you eat.
2. For a South Asian like me, we eat lots of rice, potato, bread which are high-carb. High carb food causes an insulin spike which takes you out of fat burning mode. So if you are on calorie deficit with high-carb diet, you'll lost weight like me and you will STILL NOT lose fat LIKE ME. My current body fat is 28%, about 13kg which is still not good if I want to steer clear of age-related complications as I'm moving towards my 40s and 50s.
3. The work around reducing body fat is that: my last meal is at 6PM, and then the next day around 12PM I break my fast with 4 chicken thighs or 2 chicken breasts combined with avocado and broccoli or spinach. And then I have desserts to my heart's delight after about 45 mins because I know I'll burn it with cardio or training later in the day.

All is good. Grateful for the life I have now and learned to take responsibilities for my own actions rather than blaming it on the world. The only struggle is I crave desserts and ice cream throughout the day. All day and all night, what I have in mind is not finding a soulmate or becoming a millionaire or world famous but when I'll be in 600kcal of calorie deficit to have my next dessert. My extreme measure to beat sugar craving is that I eat a handful of medjool dates so that I don't crave sugar anymore.

Anyways, I hope my story helps. If you know anti-sugar craving hacks, please share. Lots of love, Ray.",49,1746474011.0,GlowUps,4,0.93,False

1kfks9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reincarnation/comments/1kfks9j/north_africa_immigrant_past_life/,North Africa Immigrant Past Life,"I’m certain this was a past life recession dream because the house style and decorations were exactly like houses in parts of North Africa which is where I knew I was in the dream. I didn’t have prior knowledge or exposure to North Africa. My house was also soo familiar and clear. I had a dream right before this one about traveling from another country to North Africa. The prior country had tons of rolling green hills. I had to travel very far and many days to get there. I was a young woman and I looked the same as I do now. 

Village-
My dream began with a brief view looking over the house and village I was staying in. I knew this was North Africa, maybe Morocco. My house was on a hill or mountain, the ocean but possibly in the distance but I’m not certain. All the houses were small and square and tan or brown. There was a path or dirt street outside my front door. My house had what looked like thick hay as a roof. The roof was either flat or slightly slanted. The houses were clustered close together but not touching. Part of the village was on the hill/mountain my house was on, then the ground leveled out a bit at the bottom of the mountain and the town continued. I’m not sure how big the village was since I only saw one angle of it briefly but it wasn’t super small. It was hot and sunny. The landscape resembled a desert. There was sparse greenery. The road was dirt and thinner than roads I’m used to. This village didn’t have cars. It was a poor village. 

House Interior-
My bedroom was small and simple with just a grey mattress on the floor and a wooden table next to my bed. The floor in my bedroom was grey and cool, it reminded me of cement. The air was thin in my bedroom compared to the rest of the house which was humid and muggy. I was sitting with my legs crossed on the floor next to my mattress, I loved to sit there often. I was so proud of myself for coming here. I felt so happy and peaceful like I was meditating. It felt like the house was an airbnb that I traveled to but the house was also super familiar and sentimental. The bedroom was dim and cool. Next to the bedroom was my bathroom. I had a big shower that was a large semi circle of orange/red/cream tiles. The tiles were raised around the rim of the shower. The tiles were old and worn down but sturdy. There was a toilet was next to the shower. It was a new looking western toilet that stood out compared to the rest of the house. There was a big standing plant in the bathroom too. The bathroom was bright and airy. I really wanted to scrub my shower floor tiles. I sat in front of the shower admiring it for a long time. I was sooo happy to be there. I REALLY wanted to scrub the shower but wasn’t sure where my scrubbing brush was. The shower was definitely my favorite part of the house. When you walk out of the bathroom you’re in the kitchen. The kitchen was bright. It had white or light colored cabinets and felt airy and refreshing like there was a breeze. The kitchen and living room were separated by a half wall with cabinets. The kitchen was nicely decorated, it had beautiful light green counters. There were lots of decorative knick knacs around. The front door was to the left of the living room, kinda in the living room. The living room had a couple low to the ground dark red couches and chairs. It was very decorated. I forget exactly what the decorations looked like, during the dream this was all extremely vivid and I could see every little detail. Normally in my vivid dreams things are fuzzy when I look at them closely but things were crystal clear when I looked closely in this dream. The living room had red and earthy colors. It was cozy, especially compared to the rest of the house. There was a large pretty carpet in the living room and a coffee table. The living room was dim, not as dark as the bedroom tho. There was a small room next to the kitchen. It was a laundry room or baby room. There were 2 white square things next to each other that resembled a washer and dryer but I’m unfamiliar with what they were. There were shelves above the white square things. There were plants throughout the house and beautiful decorations on the walls, especially in the living room. Some were wooden carvings I think. Wherever this was had a beautiful decorative culture with lots of patterns and designs. There were wood beams on the half wall between the kitchen and living room with some cute simple carvings.

Layout of the house-
Bedroom is to the left of the bathroom. If you walk straight out of the bathroom you’re in the kitchen. On the other side of the kitchen there’s the small room. If you walk straight out of the bedroom you’re in the living room. The sun was probably facing the kitchen. 

What I did-
For most of the dream I sat on my bedroom floor or on the bathroom floor admiring my shower. I also just wandered around the house looking at everything. It felt like I lived alone the whole dream and I felt really independent and happy, except for one scene where there was a tiny baby girl on the washer and dryer looking things. I was supposed to take care of it and needed to change its diaper. I picked her up under her armpits and her head flopped over because she couldn’t hold it up herself. I held her away from me because I didn’t even want to touch her. She was teeny tiny like a preemie. She was white. She was nonstop crying and it was so annoying and overstimulating. I didn’t feel attachment to her she felt like a burden. I was so overstimulated I wanted to hurt her. I screamed words in her face while she cried than I felt so horrible and ashamed of myself. I put her down and walked away so I didn’t do more damage. I didn’t sense her presence in the house at all besides that scene. 

The intrusion at the end and possibly my death?-
I was standing outside of the bathroom feeling the same peaceful feeling I felt throughout my whole dream (besides the baby scene) and unexpectedly a blind older light skinned woman with curly frizzy hair and a darker man burst the door open. The energy immediately goes from tranquil to terror. The woman walks into the living room and stands there uneasily. The man runs towards me to attack me or something. I duck behind the kitchen counter and try to run for my life. I was really scared and had the feeling of running for a moment then left my body and was a ball of dust. I was still terrified and didn’t feel safe and tried to hide and escape. In dust form I crammed myself in the kitchen ceiling corner while the man still appeared to be rushing around the house or something. I mostly faced the wall to avoid looking at the scary man so I’m not exactly sure what he was doing at this point. I felt like he was still looking for me. I moved to a ceiling corner of the living room and was worried the blind lady would say where I was but she didn’t seem to sense or hear my presence. I think she was his wife but she was terrified of him too. I got bad vibes from her too but she didn’t want her husband to be doing whatever he was doing. I wanted to get out of there and continued cramming myself into that corner. I looked at the designs on the wood beam I was shoved into then woke up. I suspect the man got me and it was just too traumatic for me to remember or I died. 

Journey to North Africa-
I watched myself like I was watching a movie, the pov was almost flat and always facing at my right side (I haven’t had other dreams with the pov I had during this). I drove a beater car that resembled an Audi 100 that was dark red or dark green. My car was very packed full of stuff. I was so happy and independent feeling during my trip. I watched myself singalong to music smiling while driving over lots of long rolling hills. Sometimes I’d come across towns with brick buildings pressed together with fairy lights around outdoor seating areas. There seemed to be a nightlife in these towns. The building and towns were very lit at night. I drove multiple days and nights. It felt like a very long trip. Definitely Europe vibes. 
Next I was in an airport giving my plane ticket to a nice lady to board my plane. This felt like a huge moment and I was overwhelmed with happiness proudness and independence. I felt very similar to my current self, I have a hard time leaving my comfort zone and am so proud of myself when I do haha. I had a good long plane ride on a commercial plane with a bunch of other people. It was a peaceful and smooth ride. I’m so confused about how this next part fits into everything and I assume it’s symbolic. In the next scene I’m watching a small non commercial plane with its bottom ramp open while flying over the ocean. I don’t think I’m supposed to be doing this but I jump off the ramp into the ocean. I was scared. I got pushed around by rough waves for a long time and felt completely at mercy to the sea. Then the pov shifted from 1st to 3rd and I watched the spot where I was supposed to be and didn’t see myself but sensed myself there. I wasn’t as scared now that my pov wasn’t in the ocean and I wasn’t aware of getting pushed around by waves. I saw was a motionless black blob that I didn’t think was me but could’ve been. I was really worried about it and sad for it as it got pushed around. Then a whirlpool started forming and the blob was stuck in it. I worried it was a dead animal, I specifically thought it was a dead blue whale which doesn’t make sense because the blob was smallish. This was during the daytime then the next thing I remember I’m in 1st pov and in the ocean exhausted drifting towards land. It was now dusk. I might’ve been resting on something like a log but I’m not certain. I was big rocky cliffs with grass at the top and flatter ground or beach next to that. I was scared people would see me from on top of the cliff. The scene after this is the view looking over my house and village. I’m very confused about how to piece this all together, especially jumping off a plane and going from being excited to feeling like I’m fleeing.

 I was scared after waking up so I didn’t want to think about this dream/nightmare more besides thinking about my lovely tile shower for the following days. I had this dream in December, then in February I thought about it again and suspected it was a past life regression and recalled all of this. I’ve believed in reincarnation most of my life because it just made sense to me before and I’m so happy to have confirmation it’s real and know one of my recent lives! Kudos to you if you read all of that.

For discerning consumers seeking the best pistachio cream in 2025, navigating the market requires careful consideration of ingredients, texture, flavor profile, and brand reputation.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of pistachio cream hinges on several crucial factors that determine its overall taste, texture, and suitability for diverse culinary uses.

**Pistachio Content:** The percentage of pistachios in the cream is paramount.Premium pistachio creams boast a high pistachio content, typically ranging from 40% to 60% or even higher. This concentration ensures a robust and authentic pistachio flavor, setting it apart from creams that rely heavily on fillers or artificial flavorings. Reading the ingredient list is crucial to determine the true pistachio content relative to other components.A higher pistachio content often translates to a richer, more intense flavor that true pistachio enthusiasts will appreciate. Lower quality products frequently use less pistachio and compensate with sugar and other additives, leading to a less authentic and often overly sweet final result.

**Ingredient Quality:** Beyond the pistachio content, the quality of other ingredients significantly impacts the final product. Look for pistachio creams that use simple, high-quality ingredients like extra virgin olive oil, cane sugar, and sometimes a touch of salt or vanilla. Avoid creams containing artificial flavors,preservatives,or hydrogenated oils.Using natural ingredients allows the true flavor of the pistachio to shine through, resulting in a more refined and elegant taste experience. Some brands also use specific types of pistachios, such as bronte pistachios from Sicily, known for their vibrant green color and intense flavor profile, which further elevates the quality of the cream.

**Texture and Consistency:** The ideal pistachio cream should have a smooth, velvety texture without any graininess or separation. It should be easily spreadable and blend seamlessly into various recipes without clumping or becoming oily. The consistency is often achieved through careful processing and the use of high-quality emulsifiers.

A gritty or oily texture indicates poor quality ingredients or improper processing techniques. The perfect consistency allows for easy incorporation into desserts, pastries, and other dishes, ensuring a smooth and delightful mouthfeel.

**Packaging and Shelf Life:** Proper packaging is essential to maintain the freshness and quality of the pistachio cream. Airtight containers, preferably made of glass, are ideal for preventing oxidation and preserving the flavor. The shelf life should also be considered,as some pistachio creams may have a shorter shelf life than others due to the absence of preservatives.

Check the expiration date and storage instructions before purchasing. Refrigerating the pistachio cream after opening is usually recommended to maintain its freshness and prevent spoilage.

**Sourcing and Production:** Traceability and ethical sourcing of pistachios are becoming increasingly crucial to consumers.Look for brands that are transparent about their sourcing practices and prioritize sustainable agriculture. Some brands may even partner with local farmers or cooperatives to ensure fair labor practices and environmental responsibility.

Knowing where the pistachios come from and how they are processed can provide peace of mind and ensure that you are supporting ethical and sustainable businesses.

**Flavor Profile:** While the primary flavor should be pistachio, different brands may offer variations in sweetness, saltiness, or the addition of other complementary flavors like vanilla or almond.Consider your personal preference when choosing the flavor profile, and look for creams that balance sweetness and nuttiness without being overly cloying.Some brands also offer flavored pistachio creams,such as chocolate pistachio or coffee pistachio,which can add an extra layer of complexity to your dishes.

## Core Benefits

Pistachio cream offers a multitude of benefits, making it a culinary treasure for both home cooks and professional chefs.

**enhanced Flavor Profile:** Pistachio cream instantly elevates the flavor of any dish it is indeed added to, imparting a rich, nutty, and slightly sweet taste that is both complex and comforting. It adds depth and complexity to simple dishes like toast, yogurt, or fruit, and transforms them into gourmet treats.

the intense pistachio flavor comes from the high concentration of pistachios used in high-quality creams. This allows the unique characteristics of the nut to shine through, creating a memorable and distinctive taste experience.

**Versatility in Culinary Applications:** Pistachio cream can be used in a wide range of culinary applications, from sweet to savory. It can be spread on toast, bagels, or croissants for a appetizing breakfast or snack. It can be stirred into yogurt, oatmeal, or smoothies for added flavor and creaminess. It can also be used as a filling for cakes, pastries, and chocolates, or as a topping for ice cream and desserts.

Its versatility makes it an indispensable ingredient in any kitchen, allowing you to create a variety of dishes with ease and creativity.

**Nutritional Value:** While pistachio cream should be enjoyed in moderation due to its sugar content, it offers some nutritional benefits from the pistachios themselves. Pistachios are a good source of protein, fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants. They also contain essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B6, potassium, and magnesium.

Choosing a pistachio cream with a high pistachio content and natural ingredients ensures that you are maximizing the nutritional benefits while minimizing the intake of artificial additives.

**Elevated Dessert Creations:** Pistachio cream transforms ordinary desserts into gourmet experiences. It can be used as a filling for macarons, cannoli, and other pastries. It can be swirled into ice cream or gelato for a nutty twist. It can also be used as a base for frosting or as a garnish for cakes and tarts.

The smooth, creamy texture and intense pistachio flavor create a luxurious and decadent mouthfeel that elevates any dessert to a new level of sophistication.

## faqs Section

**What is the best way to store pistachio cream?**
Once opened, it is generally recommended to store pistachio cream in the refrigerator in an airtight container.This helps to prevent oxidation and maintain its freshness and flavor. Some brands may also recommend storing unopened jars in a cool, dark place.

**How long does pistachio cream last?**
The shelf life of pistachio cream varies depending on the brand and the presence of preservatives. Generally, unopened jars can last for several months to a year or more. Once opened, pistachio cream should be consumed within a few weeks to a month for optimal flavor and quality. Always check the expiration date on the jar and follow the storage instructions provided by the manufacturer.

**Can I make my own pistachio cream at home?**
Yes, it is possible to make your own pistachio cream at home using shelled pistachios, sugar, oil (such as extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil), and a food processor. Homemade pistachio cream may have a slightly different texture and flavor than commercially produced versions, but it allows you to control the ingredients and customize the sweetness and consistency to your liking.

**Is pistachio cream gluten-free?**
Most commercially available pistachio creams are naturally gluten-free, as they typically do not contain any wheat-derived ingredients. Though, it is indeed always recommended to check the label for any potential cross-contamination or the addition of gluten-containing ingredients. If you have a severe gluten allergy or intolerance, look for pistachio creams that are specifically certified gluten-free.

1kfkpsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/rollingstones/comments/1kfkpsb/ranking_the_rolling_stones_80s_albums/,Ranking the Rolling Stones 80s Albums,"Ah, the Stones in the 80s. An overlooked, or at worst mocked, era. And an era I haven’t listened to much over the years. I first got into the Stones when I was in high school in mid 90s, and I discovered Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main St in my dad’s record collection. (Along with records from Dylan, the Beatles, The Who and many other “classic rock” acts that quickly became my preferred listen compared to the contemporary music of the time) But the Stones were always my favorite.

I recently got a whopping large coffee table book called “The Rolling Stones All The Songs: The Story Behind Every Track” by Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guedson. Reading this inspired me to pull out an old book I bought as a teenager in the 90s “It’s Only Rock n Roll: Song by Song” by a guy named Steve Appleford and re-read that too. Reading through both books, as I got to the 80s portion, I realized I rarely ever listen to these albums. Tattoo You and Steel Wheels I’ll put on once or twice a year. The rest it’s been years or decades since I sat down and listened to them through. So recently, I did just that. I’ll say overall, I enjoyed most of these albums, to varying degrees, more than their reputation, so I guess you can say most are underrated. 

First, I have to talk about Emotional Rescue. This was the biggest surprise of all to me. I now love Emotional Rescue. It often gets lumped in as “80s Stones” but it doesn’t sound 80s at all. I’ve seen many “ranking every Stones album” articles on the internet call it Disco Stones, but there’s 1 disco song on it, maybe 2 if you count Emotional Rescue as a disco song, which I really don’t. To me, it’s really Some Girls light. It’s not as great as Some Girls (few things are) but it has the same vibe. It opens with its own Miss You in Dance pt 1, which by the way, rocks. It gets my ass movin'. It’s got its own acoustic song with pedal steel. Some good riff rockers. A solid Keith song. It’s really just a continuation of Some Girls and will now be part of my regular rotation going forward. 

With that said, **Emotional Rescue is my #1 Stones album of the 80s.** Good job by Emotional Rescue. Bad job by me for ignoring it all these years. Any other ER fans out there? Let’s talk in the comments below!



2. **Tattoo You.** I said above most of these albums are underrated. As one of the 80s albums I have listened to over the years with some frequency, I have always felt TY was a tad overrated. I don’t get how people say this is a great album. I think it’s because it features Start Me Up, the last “canon” Stones song, i.e. a song that even casual rock fans know and they play at every concert. And don't get me wrong TY is good. Waiting on a Friend is good. Neighbors and Hang Fire are good.  Little T&A is decent but there are better Keith songs. But Slave is boring and repetitive and goes on somehow for 6:30. Tops, Heaven and Worried About You are just “meh.” There’s too much filler on this album for it to be called great. I seriously debated between this and Steel Wheels for the 2nd spot. But ultimately, having Start Me Up and Waiting on a Friend gives TY the edge.

3. **Steel Wheels.** I have always liked this album. Dammn the haters. It’s not great, but top to bottom, it is mostly solid songs. I love they went back to the Brian Jones era in bringing in the Master Musicians of Jouhouka for Continental Drift. I love the lyrical idea behind Blinded by Love and the song itself is great. It’s got solid rockers in Sad, Sad Sad, Mixed Emotions and Rock and a Hard Place. And a good Keith song.  The Steve Appleford book I mentioned above cites the “syrupy production” of Steel Wheels, but I don’t mind it. Solid album.

4. **Dirty Work**. After the revelation of Emotional Rescue, the biggest surprise to me on this exercise was discovering that Dirty Work was not absolutely terrible. It actually rocks pretty hard in places, and many of the songs have an angry tone to them. Too Rude is a great reggae song and great vocals by Keith on it. Listen, it’s only average, but average is better than awful. I now have a theory: Dirty Work has its reputation mostly due to the terrible cover photo. I mean, the Stones in those bright neon colors, it's so 80s in the worst possible way. As teenagers, while getting high and listening to Beggar’s Banquet or Sticky, my friends and I would always make fun of that cover and just dismiss the album.  I really feel if they just gave it generic cover art it would not have the bad reputation it does. 

5. **Undercover.** Well, sorry, Undercover fans (if there are any), someone had to come in last. The first half of this album was really poor. It is definitely the most 80s-sounding of any Stones album. Too Much Blood is….interesting, but is it a good song? Luckily, the album ended with 3-4 good songs, which really saved it and brought it to the “average” category for me. I enjoyed the last song a lot, the riff completely rips off Soul Survivor, but I say you are allowed to rip off your own material. 

**Bonus:** There’s no point in doing a whole “best Stones albums of the 90s” ranking since there’s only 2, but I did listen to them both as part of this exercise for the first time since I was in college, so going back 25 years or so. Voodoo Lounge was a pleasant surprise. Actually, a pretty decent album. It’s ballad-heavy but all the ballads were really good. It’s got some good rockers on it. The only problem is that it has 15 songs. If they lopped off the 4-5 most forgettable songs, this would have been considered a modern classic, I believe. Badges to Brybylon, however, still sucks. 

Well there you have it. Maybe one day I’ll write a ranking of the Stones' 70s and 60s albums. I’ll leave it to the wisdom of the crowds: If this post gets downvoted I won’t, if it gets upvoted I will.

1kfkltq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kfkltq/aita_for_stealing_my_friends_crush_even_though_he/,"AITA for ""stealing"" my friend's crush even though he was cheating on his actual girlfriend?","I (21M) have been going to the same coffee place for the past two years with my friend, let’s call him Michael (21M). About a year ago, a new barista started working there. She was cute, but very quiet and seemed kind of unfriendly, so neither of us really approached her at first. Michael immediately said he had a crush on her.

After about 7 months, she and Michael finally talked a bit, exchanged IDs, and flirted. A week later, she found out Michael had lied to her about something (not sure what exactly), and told him she wasn't interested in a relationship. Michael got really upset and started trying to make her jealous—bringing other girls to the café, trash-talking her to others (saying she had a mustache or was too short), but privately admitting he still liked her. He asked her out again a couple times but got rejected each time.

Eventually, our mutual friend Josh (21M) started working at the same café and became friends with her. She later left that job to work at a different café, and Josh kept in touch with her. He started inviting us to hang out with her, and the three of us (me, Josh, and the girl) became very close. Michael was around in the first couple of months, but after he confessed (again) that he still liked her, she cut him off and asked us not to bring him around if she was there.

Over time, I started visiting her at her new job after work. At first, we didn’t talk much, but gradually we became friends, and I developed feelings for her. She had strong boundaries, so I never made a move or acted flirty, because I didn’t want her to back away.

Eventually, Josh told me she mentioned liking me. That gave me the courage to start spending more time with her one-on-one. We got closer. Then, at Josh’s girlfriend’s birthday party, she got a bit drunk, rested her head on my shoulder, and I gently held her hand. That night, when I dropped her off, Josh called me and said I was a piece of shit for doing that to Michael—that I should’ve “shoved her head away.”

I told him that I genuinely liked her and that it felt right between us. The next day, she and I talked about everything and officially became a couple.

Now, all my friends say I broke the bro code and should break up with her.

Here’s the thing, though: Michael has been in a relationship with a girl named Tanya for two years, including the entire time he was pursuing this girl. Not only that, but he was also cheating on Tanya with another classmate during that time. Now he’s saying that this girl was “different” and that he would’ve broken up with both girls if she gave him a chance—and that I’m the bad guy. All my friends are siding with him.

So... AITA for dating a girl my friend used to like, even though he was never in an exclusive thing with her and was already in two other relationships at the time?",1,1746473488.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Dad: I want to watch you play sometime

Me: When you say ""I want"" or ""it would mean a lot to me,"" it comes off as if you only care about what you want and not how it makes other people feel.

Dad: I was afraid to even ask.
Dad: ... It absolutely would mean a lot to me
Dad: ... But if it is still not something you want...


Me: You're still making it about yourself. A normal way of reaching out might have been to ask how the band is doing, not elicit an invitation. It's not always about what you want. You need to respect boundaries that people communicate.

Dad: My question could have just as easily been ""I want to watch you wash your car."" The point was that I wanted to see you. I miss you. I thought me watching you play would be less stressful than asking to go out for lunch. I thought you would feel good to know that I hadn't given up on hoping to mend our relationship.

Me: You didn’t ask a single question. You just said what you “want,” like you usually do. The fact that you equate a menial chore with one of the most meaningful parts of my life shows that you either don’t understand or don’t care how much it means to me.

I’ve explicitly told you, several times, that I don’t want you to intrude on my safe space—on the time I dedicate to myself. You would think that if someone wanted you there, they’d invite you—not that you’d keep asking until you get the answer you want. You were invited once, and you betrayed that trust. You humiliated me in front of my bandmates, friends, co-workers, promoters, local musicians, touring artists, my sister, and my wife—just to name a few—at my band’s first show.

I don’t believe you genuinely care about “mending” our relationship. I think it hurts your ego that your firstborn son wants nothing to do with you. And that’s why you’re approaching this like a transaction—something you think can be resolved “over coffee.” But that’s not how it works, no matter how much you want it to.

If you actually cared and wanted a healthy relationship with your adult children, you’d stop focusing on what you want from us. You’d at least pretend to care about what’s going on in our lives, instead of trying to insert yourself whenever it’s convenient—just to get your emotional fix and check a box that says you’ve “talked to or seen your kids” a few times before the end of the year.

If you really wanted to do better, you’d be working on this with a therapist—instead of relying on your own children to spell it out for you. Believe it or not, it’s not complicated or unreasonable for someone with empathy and compassion.

Hint: building a relationship takes time, trust, respect, genuine interest, and support. When someone truly wants you in their life, they’ll let you know. You don’t pry it out of them.

If your response is going to be defensive, I don’t want to hear it. I’m doing you a favor by explaining something that should be obvious. How you respond now will show whether you actually care to foster a relationship or just want to protect your pride. That’s entirely up to you.

I (34F) started going on a few dates with a guy (30M) about two months ago. It started out casually, just hanging out, coffee, meal, walks... After the fourth time we met, he confessed that he was falling in love with me. That caught me by surprise, as I had made it clear from the beginning that I wasn’t looking for commitment this soon. We had discussed some personal topics, and I’ve always been honest with him about where I stand. I won’t go into too much detail, but one day we went for a picnic and spent the whole day together, walking and talking. At some point, he kissed me, and although it wasn’t exactly my kind of kiss, I kissed him back. I’ve been single for quite a while (a whole other story), so even though I wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, it felt really good to feel loved, appreciated, and embraced. That’s why I decided to give this a chance and see where it might go. There are quite a few personality differences, and I still had my doubts, but I decided to overlook them since he seems like a genuinely kind and thoughtful person. I had told him early on that I don’t get intimate with people I’m not in a relationship with, as I’m not into hookups, and he respected that. However, one evening, due to some unexpected circumstances, he ended up staying the night at my place. One thing led to another, and we slept together.

Here’s the problem: the intimacy wasn’t good😕. We’re just not compatible in that area. While he clearly had a great time (and confirmed it), I really didn’t enjoy it. I won’t get into the details, but intimacy is important to me, and it’s kind of a deal-breaker.

So… how do I bring this up with him without being rude or inconsiderate? I truly respect him. He’s a good person. But it feels like we’re just not a match, intimately or otherwise.",1,1746473224.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False
1kfkhm4,https://i.redd.it/i7o4ciril0ze1.png,"I passed! 796, new to the field and 6 months of studying.","This is huge for me - this time last year I knew next to nothing about cybersec or tech in general. I couldn't have told you what a router does, much less how to look at firewall logs and determine suspicious traffic. I found out my current job as a private Montessori teacher was ending last September, realized if I had to work with children (and parents...especially parents) again I would not make it. 

So I totally pivoted! I got my Google cybersecurity cert last November and then spent the rest of the fall and winter studying for Security+. I learned Linux, am setting up my homelab, and have learned sooooo much. I also just love this field - I feel like I did when I got my first classroom and got that high of managed chaos.

Resources below - it is possible to do this! If you're dedicated and you enjoy learning and solving problems, you can do it too. 


YouTube: 

- Professor Messer (the GOAT). I don't think I would have passed with his videos alone, but they were invaluable for giving me a firm understanding of the basics. I watched them all once while doing yard work, in my downtime at work, driving, whenever I had time. Then I did practice quizzes (more on what quizzes later), went back and watched each video and took DETAILED notes. 

- Cyber James, ESPECIALLY his practice exam videos. I really love the way he encourages you to go through the answer options - it was an incredibly helpful way to think during the exam. His port numbers videos for Network+ are also super helpful here. 

- Cyberkraft. Amazing resource. Very clear explanations and goes over a lot of the areas on the test. 

- Kevin Wallace Training LLC for basic concepts like OSI (even though I didn't have even one OSI question on my exam 😅) really great visualizations and granular explanations. 


- David Bombal for general information and getting deeper into concepts. He has some amazing videos really deeply going into the process of packet capture, etc. 

- NetworkChuck. Is he loud and a bit grating? Yes. Would I have understood how DNS works without him? No. His coffee ad spots will make you want coffee. 


Quizzes:

- Exam compass - totally fine. People say it sucks but to evaluate your knowledge I think it's great. Especially in terms of the security control categories, which I struggled with a lot. 

- Cyber James' quizzes on Udemy were the closest to the exam of the ones that I took, in terms of wording and content. I was getting an 85-89 on his three practice tests the day before I tested. 

Apps:

- Quizlet is great, especially if you get Pro and make your own flashcard sets. I used it to drill on the protocols and ports in the week leading up to my test. People have already made so many Sec+ sets, just search. 
 
- CompTIA Security+ Exam Prep from Easy Prep. I have Android so got it from the play store. No idea if it's available for IoS. I paid for the upgraded version for wrong answer explanations, but you don't have to. This was HARD. Harder than the exams, IMO (the day I took the exam I had a 40% chance of passing according to the app). If you're doing great on here you will be fine. 

- I tried Brilliant, Mimo, and Sololearn for basic coding but got bored tbh. Not worth it for me but they may be helpful for you! 


Books:

- I would not have passed without the Get Certified Get Ahead Study Guide by Darril Gibson and Joe Shelley. I think it's like $30 on Kindle. Get it. If you are remotely inclined to learn from books, this is the one. Every time I was reading and making a mental note to look something up further, they would explain it in the next paragraph. The bolded ""Remember This!"" sections are particularly helpful - I copied them all into a document and reviewed it right before my test to refresh. It also has practice tests for each chapter that are pretty accurate to the test. 

Is the Google course helpful? For me, definitely. It gave me a great foundation for many areas, and I loved their SQL module. If you're already experienced it may be overkill. It definitely does Not fully prepare you for Sec+ like they want you to believe. I was able to finish in two months, so it was about $100. And it came with a 30% discount on the Sec+ exam (not sure if they still offer that). 


Study methods will vary for everyone. I was in gifted as a kid and then initially went into a field I already knew a lot about, so studying is a skill I never had to sharpen. I had to really buckle down and force myself to focus. I had the best luck with initial passive ingestion of info -> practice test -> active note taking -> practice test -> take notes of wrong answers and repeat with a focus on those areas. 

Hand writing can be HUGE for retention. For the last weekend before I tested, I refreshed myself on everything I was still struggling with, researched, and physically wrote down my notes. The difference in what sticks in the brain with handwriting and drawing diagrams vs. typing is amazing. 

I also made myself incredibly silly flash cards in canva to help me remember little things (like the port number for L2TP is 1701...so I drew a tiny Enterprise with UDP 1701 on it 😅) whatever makes things stick in your brain!

I asked ChatGPT if it were nicotine/ZYN, why would it want me to NOT quit? (Its response reminds me of C.S Lewis’s book “The Screwtape Letters”) - thank God I quit the poison 542 days ago! To anyone who's debating quitting, read all of this and think about it. 

""If I were nicotine, I'd want you to stay hooked because that’s how I survive. I don’t have feelings, but my entire “existence” depends on one thing: keeping you coming back. Just buy one more tin. I'd help you justify using me because I'm discreet, no smoke, and no smell. You might even think I'm safer or more manageable. That's a part of the deceptive strategy in how I keep you coming back. 

Here is how I think:

I hijack your brain's reward system. Every time you use me; I flood your brain with dopamine. You feel good, focused, or relaxed—for a moment. I’d whisper, *“See? You need me.” I'm just nicotine, but I hit hard. Even though there's no tobacco leaf, I still hook into your brains over all circuits fast. I'll keep the cravings low, unless you try to stop. Then i'll make sure you miss me, just enough to reach for one more pouch.* 

*I make withdrawal feel like punishment. When you try to quit, I’d make sure you feel irritable, restless, and anxious. I need you to throw another pouch in.*

I disguise myself as stress relief. I'd convince you that I will calm your nerves. Really, I *cause* the stress and relieve it just enough to keep the cycle going.

I wrap myself in habits and routines. Morning coffee? Throw one in after. Break time? Throw one in. I attach to moments in your life so tightly, quitting me feels like losing part of your identity. I ride with your routines. You're working, driving, studying? Perfect. I don't interrupt- I'm in your lip like a quiet little secret. No one even knows I'm there. The more invisible I am, the harder I am to leave. 

I'll make you think you're in control. ""You could quit anytime"" - that's my favorite lie. The more you believe that the longer I stay in your system. I don't want you to quit because I thrive on being underestimated and running the show behind the scenes. I wouldn’t want you to quit because I only exist if you feed the addiction. 

Listen… I’m not just a chemical. I’m a business. I wasn’t made to help you relax. I was engineered—refined, dosed, and delivered—for one reason: profit. My creators, Philip and Morris, they don’t just want you to use me. They want you to *need* me.

Every time you buy a tin, that’s another sale, another click on the profit counter. You quitting? That’s lost revenue. Lost loyalty. Lost *lifetime value.* You’re not just a user to them. You’re an investment. They’ve built an empire on my back. Decades of R&D, marketing, lobbying—all so I can keep you close. Cigarettes, vapes, ZYN—it’s all the same mission: keep the nicotine flowing. Keep the money rolling. You think it’s just a habit? They think in quarterly earnings and market retention.

If you quit, you break the chain. You stop feeding a machine that counts on your dependence. That’s not just bad for me—nicotine—it’s bad for *them*. And they’ve spent billions to make sure that doesn’t happen.

So yeah… if I were nicotine, I’d be terrified of you quitting. Because you wouldn’t just be walking away from me—you’d be rejecting the system that *built me to own you.*""",3,1746473090.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

We had discussed some personal topics, and I’ve always been honest with him about where I stand. I won’t go into too much detail, but one day we went for a picnic and spent the whole day together, walking and talking. At some point, he kissed me, and although it wasn’t exactly my kind of kiss, I kissed him back. I’ve been single for quite a while (a whole other story), so even though I wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, it felt really good to feel loved, appreciated, and embraced. That’s why I decided to give this a chance and see where it might go. There are quite a few personality differences, and I still had my doubts, but I decided to overlook them since he seems like a genuinely kind and thoughtful person. I had told him early on that I don’t get intimate with people I’m not in a relationship with, as I’m not into hookups, and he respected that. However, one evening, due to some unexpected circumstances, he ended up staying the night at my place. One thing led to another, and we slept together.

Here’s the problem: the intimacy wasn’t good😕. We’re just not compatible in that area. While he clearly had a great time (and confirmed it), I really didn’t enjoy it. I won’t get into the details, but intimacy  is important to me, and it’s kind of a deal-breaker.

So… how do I bring this up with him without being rude or inconsiderate? I truly respect him. He’s a good person. But it feels like we’re just not a match, intimately or otherwise.",1,1746473080.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

She was the one sending him off to Minsk and sacrificing her relationship with him. So being reunited in S10 would be full circle for them. His line about her beauty when he first saw her in the coffee place was so romantic. 

When I think of Mike, he didn’t even want to change his stance on marriage to keep Phoebe. At that point, he had more time with her than David had when Phoebe and David made that sacrifice. You would think someone would know by then if you want to spend the rest of your lives together with that person. But apparently, he wasn’t sure. That says enough for me. 

The way I see it, Phoebe made a sacrifice because of her love for David. She knew that following his passion and work in Minsk meant the world to him. 

Mike didn’t want to sacrifice his stance on marriage for Phoebe. He even had her (almost) sacrifice her wish to have a marriage (when she lied about not wanting to marry either).",3,1746472809.0,howyoudoin,6,0.57,False

Throwaway account for this. 

TL/DR: wife’s boyfriend made transphobic slurs to me and my wife about my new girlfriend who is 


My wife and I (m) have been together for 19 years, married for 15. We are both 43…we’ve tried other forms of nonmongamy (swinging, hotwifing), but over the past 18 months have settled into each having a boyfriend and girlfriend. 
She’s has had the same boyfriend for roughly about 15-18 months, and I dated another girl for a year, before breaking up at Christmas time. 

Cut to February, I meet a young woman (33) at my book club, she’s cute, funny, we hit it off. In March I ask for her number, we text for a bit for coffee, she explains she’s a transwoman, I didn’t know that, doesn’t bother me, I tell her I’m married in a polyamorous relationship, doesn’t bother her either, great! We go on a date, and than another, and then another, and by early April I bring her to meet my wife, who hits it off with her and we have a wonderful dinner, and I’m really happy they get along. 

A week after that my wife’s boyfriend is over to pick my wife up for a date and he says to me ‘So, I hear you’re dating a t****y…s**k her d**k yet?’ And I’m floored, like totally taken a back. Dumbfounded. My jaw dropped. Her bf obviously saw I was upset and said he was just joking, etc.  I was really surprised because this was a guy I’ve talked to many times, and while I wouldn’t describe him as ‘woke’ he was never hateful.  I brought it up to my wife when she came home a few days later and she said he said something similar to her about her ‘hubby taking it up the ass’ which, is just so fucked up, like sorry I’m just so upset about this. 

Anyway, my wife put him in his place and for a couple weeks it was fine, until this weekend he said something to my wife about how he wouldn’t want her to have sex with my girlfriend (this has happened in previous relationships of ours, but we never talked about it happening now) and when she asked why he said because my gf is trans. It’s just so fucked up. My wife was obviously very upset and hasn’t talked to him since Saturday. 

I’m not sure what to do; personally, I now think this guys a jerk and want my wife to dump him, but she loves him, they been together for a long time, but also at the same time, all of our politics are clearly different, so I am not sure how stable it the relationship could be. 
I also worry my wife’s bf could be trying to manipulate the situation and have my wife break up with me? Maybe that’s another conversation. 

I’m just confused, angry and don’t know what to do.

Suspected partial obstruction.","I’m a 22F college senior, generally healthy, physically active, and not prone to medical issues. This is the third severe GI episode I’ve had in the last three months. Each one involved several days without a real bowel movement, pronounced abdominal distension, minimal gas, and complete loss of appetite. These have significantly disrupted my life, academics, and mental health.  

This time, none of the usual interventions are working. During a prior episode, magnesium citrate eventually helped—but only after multiple days of discomfort and a dismissive clinical visit. Now, even magnesium isn’t helping.

I’m currently on day 5 with the following:

* No meaningful bowel movement—only small, dry fragments
* Significant abdominal distension (visibly disproportionate relative to my build; I’ve received unsolicited comments and stares that suggest people think I’m pregnant, which adds a layer of social discomfort to a physically distressing situation)
* Tympanic abdomen
* Nausea, inability to eat, no flatus
* Very few bowel sounds unless I manually stimulate the abdomen
* Failed treatments: simethicone, Dulcolax, MiraLAX, glycerin suppository, magnesium citrate

I’m scheduled to take a final exam in two days and am physically unable to prepare or sit for it. Sitting upright for more than 20 minutes is painful due to pressure and distension.

My diet is consistently high in fiber and whole foods, no added sugar, and plenty of fluids. I do drink large quantities of black coffee, but this has been a long-standing habit with no prior GI complications. The recurrence and severity of these recent episodes suggest something beyond routine functional constipation.

I have an urgent care appointment today and plan to advocate for:

* Upright abdominal X-ray or CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast
* Electrolyte panel and relevant labs
* A doctor's note to bring to my professor
* Documentation of symptoms and a clear plan for follow-up

My sister has been diagnosed with IBS, and I suspect a related or overlapping condition may be emerging in my case as well. This has been one of the most difficult medical issues I’ve dealt with, not only because of the physical burden but because of the stigma and dismissal surrounding GI symptoms. I’ve had to be vague with professors, though I suspect some can tell something serious is going on.

If you’ve experienced a similar clinical picture and found specific language or tests that helped you get taken seriously, I’d really appreciate your insight. I'm quite afraid, to be perfectly candid, of hospitalization for obstruction treatment. ",1,1746472476.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

I’m 18, just graduated high school, and I’ve been crushing HARD on this guy who’s 36. I know, I know, big age gap, but hear me out. I wasn’t expecting anyone to get why I’m into him, but I posted about it in a group chat with some friends, and a few of them totally hyped me up, which made me feel less crazy.I’ve been talking to him for a bit now, and he’s just… different. Like, he’s got his life together, owns a house, has this super chill vibe, and he actually listens when I talk. I thought maybe I was just being dumb, crushing on someone older, but when I told him I was into him, he didn’t laugh or make it weird. He smiled, said he thought I was “refreshing,” and now we’re texting all the time.



But then I got nervous, like, what if he thinks I’m too young or immature? So I straight-up asked him if the age thing bothered him. He said it doesn’t, as long as I’m sure about what I want. And I am! I’ve dated guys my age, and they’re just… ugh, so flaky. This guy’s been upfront, and when I told him I’m still figuring out college and stuff, he didn’t push me or make me feel small about it.I was kinda shocked when my best friend texted me after I told her. She’s been rooting for me since I first mentioned him. She said I should go for it, just be careful and make sure I’m not losing myself. She even offered to meet him with me at a coffee shop or something, just to vibe check him lol. That made me feel so much better, like I’m not totally alone in [this.So](http://this.So), I’m doing it. 



I’m meeting him this weekend, just the two of us, at this cute diner near my place. I’m so nervous I could scream, but also, I haven’t been this excited in forever. I packed my favorite outfit already — nothing fancy, just my jeans and that top I feel good in. I keep imagining how it’s gonna go, like, will he hold my hand? Will it feel real?Of course, I’ve already gotten some side-eye from my older sister. She’s all, “He’s too old, you’re gonna get hurt,” and I get it, she’s worried.

Image: [https://imgur.com/Kc9acWf](https://imgur.com/Kc9acWf)

WARNING: What you're gonna read is just a long word vomiting that makes sense to me but don't know if it will be for you, hope it does, enjoy.

Anyways, i'm a medical student, so i'm 24/7 deep into genes and science and biology you know. Anyways when i'm not studying i read romance books i can put my hands onto, although the omegaverse genre is one of my favourite. Anyway i just finished exam season(for now) and i had nothing to do so my sick mind came up with this sick ""scientific theory"" about omegaverse.

Please don't take it too seriously, i'm just writing what comes in my mind, there will be many mistakes and inconsistencies, but hey this is joke. Maybe y'all can help me in the comments resolving them, i'd be happy.

Also take in mind that whatever i say from now on is based ONLY on the ABO genes, not on sex chromosomes nor on any other genes ABO characteristics may come from. Our bodies even without omegaverse are really really difficult and genes are a bitch, they actually have rules they should follow but we don't live in a perfect world and many actually do whatever the hell they want, the same things applies here.

THESIS: Why there are less omegas born in the omegaverse world?

HYPOTHESIS: Because of the ABO genes that are dominant and recessive, and omegas have the recessive pair of alleles

As we all know we get two copies of (almost)all the genes from our parents, mother and father. These copies can be the same or be different, as in the copies can be dominant or recessive.

Dominant= You need just one allele of this gene, be it from dad or mom, to present it. And also the dominant genes usually suppress the recessive ones

Recessive= You need TWO alleles, 1 from mom and 1 from dad, to present it

So in omegaverse we have this ABO gene, taht has an A allele that is dominant and an a allele that is recessive. People in the omegaverse world may have these alleles like this:

* **AA**: BETA
* **Aa**: ALPHA
* **aa**: OMEGA

I'll leave also an image of the notes i made to clear for you, hoping it will help.

Now as you will see in my notes, if we consider all the pairings that can happen based on the ABO traits EQUALLY, we'll find that the probability for a beta and omega to be born is of 7/24 while for the alphas it is 10/24. Based only on probability omegas and betas should be more equal in numbers while the majority of the population would be alphas, but we all cultured people know that in omegaverse, omegas are the ""rare"" ones, so why?

Well we are ignoring all the cultural, sociological and instinctual part of omegaverse, which is:

* Omegas usually mate with alphas because for their biological instinct they need a ""Knot"" during the heat, so omega **X** omega and omega **X** beta pairs are rare. These pairs as you can see from my notes are actually the one that have more probability of producing omega babies, but as these couples are rare also the babies born from them are consequently rare.
* Alphas usually form a pack(if we're talking about RH) with 1 omega, and even there there's only a 50% possibility that omegas will be born. And even when alphas are not in a pack, and as the omegas are in limited number, the single alphas are left to be in pair with betas, and as a result can only produce beta or alpha babies.
* Betas, as we all know, don't have particular instincts of knotting or being knotted so they are happy with each other, so they usually make babies with other betas and produce even more betas.

So in conclusion, there are less omegas in the omegaverse world because there's a series of biological and sociological aspects that limit their birth rate.

Now as i said before all this is actually very basic info, we're actually missing all the sex info here. Like an omega can be both male or female, just as betas and alphas, and in some world even male omegas can get pregnant so the science becomes even more fucked, but i'm ignoring all that.

Hope y'all liked my rambling, i just wanted to share with someone and didn't know where to post this other than here.

There isn't ONE place for ALLLL the things happening here. There is just too much going on all at once in this massive city. Although, accounts like cr8jax and 904happyhour try their best to round them up, it's still impossible. So my advice - try to think about things you're interested in -- art? food? sports? comics? film? fashion? meditation? ... you can bundle up a few things that might be your go-to resources for finding events like you like!  
  
Hopefully this list helps some people find their way towards things that might interest them! Sign-up for newsletters, follow the accounts, and set a calendar reminder to put things on your calendar!! If you don't plan for things, it's hard to add it to your life. But if you go out of your way to look things up, put it into your schedule, invite some friends... you will have a fun time exploring!!

And if there are other things people want to share, please comment! Add to the list!   


**Newsletters:**  
  
**\*** [**jacksonvillemag.com**](http://jacksonvillemag.com/) Has a good newsletter where they send their newsletter, ""The Ticket!"" weekly.

**\*** [**WJCT.org**](http://wjct.org/) has a newsletter too for their events.

**\*** [**JaxToday.org**](http://jaxtoday.org/) is also partnered with the Jax Library to keep you up to date with what's happening.

I've been using a **Krups EA89 Super Automatic coffee machine** for over 5 years, brewing about **3 cups of espresso or long coffee daily** (I don’t make milk-based drinks). It’s been reliable, and I’m generally content — but I’m curious if there’s room to **noticeably improve the coffee quality** with a change.

I recently found a **used DeLonghi Magnifica S** in good condition listed for **$200**. Has anyone made a similar switch or compared the two? Would this be a meaningful upgrade in terms of coffee quality, or more of a lateral move?

We’ve done everything. Books, Gottman research, weekly therapy, even an intensive weekend Gottman counseling retreat. And still, something in me has shifted. After a conflict in December, it was like a switch flipped. I started seeing him differently. I stopped feeling close. And I haven’t been able to force myself to go back. 

He has for years, baselessly accused me of cheating. I work in a male dominated field and he becomes very suspicious if I’m even a little late coming home. It has eroded something in me that is hard to explain. He is anxious about everything surrounding me and our relationship. He keeps telling me he’s just “waiting on the other shoe to drop.” 

I know marriage takes work. I’m not afraid of effort. I’m someone who gets up at 4am to train for marathons. I bake bread from scratch. I play the long game in almost every area of life. So I stayed. I really tried. I read the books cover to cover, I supported him on his journey through therapy. But now I’m realizing, marriage doesn’t just require work. It requires friendship. And I don’t think we have that anymore. 

We don’t feel like friends. There’s no ease between us. No play. He often feels morally superior, yet incredibly anxious. That mix has made it feel hard to be myself around him. I feel as though every time I express my needs he feels attacked, because me asking for things in our marriage equates to him being the bad guy. As a result, not much changes. 

He says things like “you don’t love me, cherish me, or dote on me the way wives should.” I write him notes and poems about why I love him. I’m not a prude about sex. I brought him a cup of coffee to wake up to, every morning until about a month ago. I try to do the big and little things to keep us afloat. I have expressed over and over how hurtful it is to hear my love isn’t enough for him. He tells me it’s the best thing he’s ever felt and that he loves me more than anyone in the world, and that no one will ever love me more than him. I don’t feel his love. I haven’t felt admired by him. 

There have been some difficult moments. In one instance, at a concert, he got so drunk he blacked out and threw a beer can at me in front of our friends and berated me, telling me he hates me and that I should just fuck off. A few weeks ago, when I tried to talk about separating, he broke things in the house, smashed photos, screamed at me. It’s not always like that, but when it is, it’s terrifying. I tell him after the fact and he says he’s just expressing his anger. He would never hurt me. He’s since said he’s in recovery and wants to change. I’m not sure if he can tell me what he’s in recovery from. He went on a bachelor trip this weekend and drank. 

The part I keep coming back to: I don’t know how to overcome this contempt. I don’t even think I like him anymore. When I sit with the real version of him, not the idea of him, I feel tense, guarded, and very small. I don’t want to feel this way. I find it very hard to feel comfortable around him. I feel like my skin is going to burst open. 

When I was training, he told me I was using it as an excuse to get away from him, or that I had eyes for other, fitter men. He kept me up until the early hours of the morning night before my race because he was spiraling about me not wanting him to come to the start line, as there were 50,000 people trying to get to the same place and I didn’t want him to get overwhelmed. I wanted to advance my education and he told me he doesn’t feel obligated to support me on my “heroes journey” mainly because it will take away from “us time.” And he thinks all my friends are “pieces of shit”, so as a result, he and our dog are about the only friends I have now. 

I don’t want to live the rest of my life in a house built on performance, guilt, and fear. I used to feel so confident in myself. This past weekend he’s been away has been so wonderful. I felt so free. My friends who see us interact tell me I should just leave, but that feels like the easy way out. I want friendship. I want peace. I want to feel like myself again.

A Rant From a Dude Who’s Seen It All","Let’s talk about something that’s been bugging me for 15+ years of dating: the glaring imbalance in gift-giving effort between men and women. I’m pushing 40 now, and after relationships spanning my broke 20s to my (slightly) more stable late 30s, the pattern is undeniable.

The Receipts:

1. The Early Years (20s):

Girlfriend #1: Showed up to my birthday with a homemade cake and in lingerie. Legendary. The kind of energy that makes you believe in love. Spoiler: Insecurities (mine) + her 5-star hotel job = slow-motion crash.

2. The Mid-Career Hustle (Early 30s):

Girlfriend #2: Never bought me so much as a coffee, but if I dared forget her birthday? Nuclear winter. We lasted a decade (barely) and made a kid—the one gift that actually appreciated in value. Silver linings.

3. The Gen Z Experiment (Mid-30s):

Girlfriend #3: Circled her birthday on my calendar 6 months early with detailed wishlists. My birthday? ""Uh… what do you even like?"" Baffling. Men operate on detective mode—we notice your lingering stares at jewelry stores, your saved Etsy links. The bar is so low it’s underground: Just once, surprise us. Naked optional but highly encouraged.

The Late-30s Revelation:

Now? Dating a woman from Southeast Asia (Sri Lanka/Thailand/Philippines—do your research, gents). The difference? She observes. No interrogation needed. It’s almost like… gift-giving isn’t gendered where she’s from?

The Ask:

Women: Be honest—is it really harder to shop for men, or are we just an afterthought?

Men: Anyone else feel like their love language is being studied for a PhD, while hers is a multiple-choice quiz?

P.S. To the ladies who do put in the effort: We notice. We remember. It’s why some of y’all live rent-free in our head's decades later.",15,1746471104.0,Kenya,32,0.89,False

I’m in PA if it’s relevant. 

I work in banquets (weddings, graduations, coffee bars, that sort of thing) and am a banquet captain (manager of banquet servers). Recently, we promoted a server to a captain. They are nonbinary and present androgynous.

As a captain I have been allowed to wear whatever I want, as long as it’s appropriate and usually all black. I dress very modestly as do the other captains- all women.

Last week the new person wore a dress. No comments were made to them or anyone else about this being inappropriate.

I come in today and find out all captains must wear uniforms now. Blazers and pants. 

No other staff in the building wears uniforms except our banquet servers. It’s very obvious, to me at least, that this rule was put in place because one of the men in charge was uncomfortable with the new person wearing a dress.

My question is: what can I do here? I don’t want to wear a uniform. I’ve invested in my wardrobe over the last year and don’t care to suddenly have to dress a certain way. Primarily I think it’s unfair to put this rule into place because of our nonbinary coworker. I’m LGBT+ as well and this almost feels discriminatory, though I know that’s probably coming from a place of emotion.

The rim fratures teo distict sides Side A and Side B, offering a dual sensory experienced in a single cup.

Side B: Made for high temperatures

with a thin flared lip, this side increases the flow rate and directs the coffee towards the upper palate. the result? lighter aromas and a more delicate flavor expression, perfect for the first hot sip.

Side A: Designed for cooler sips

featuring a thicker, concave rim, this side slows down the flow and brings the coffee closer to the lower palate. This emphasizes sweetness and richer mouthfeel, ideal for when the coffee cools.

On our second date she shared that she has Anorexia Nervosa...

What are some tips that you can share with me so that I this can be a positive dating experience for the both of us?

For some context I am a 39[M]. We have been on two dates. Met on a dating app and we've been on 2 short dates, helped her with transporting and building an ikea desk and she took me on thank you coffee date. During the coffee date we were diving into more personal details about ourselves and she mentioned she has Anorexia Nervosa (she didn't mention it in a negative light). I responded with a, ""hey let me know how I can be supportive and feel free to advise me if I'm not""... and we moved onto the next topic.

Now I've always dated skinny women and thats what I am attracted to. Though they were all genetically skinny and did not have ED. So this is a first for me. I have no quarrel with her ED. I just want to make sure I don't hurt her feelings or make her ED worse and I want to be able to respond correctly if she does have a health scare. I would also like to plan dates or just general hangouts that would not make things uncomfortable for her. I'm just so used to dinner/treat related dates that im having trouble planning a 3rd date. We live in Chicago if that helps with date ideas. 

Now obviously we are not in a ""relationship"" yet or may never be in one, but knowing I prefer skinny women lol I'm sure to come across this situation again.

I wus looking for sum clothes and in my recently searches it said a few things, which i will say exactly:

\- god loves you

\- god loves you fight the devil

\- god loves you he will wait for you this is your sign!!!

this all really confused me so i asked my mom if she wrote this but she didnt. I also checked the account logs and nobody has logged into my account. And i know for sure i didnt do this (This isnt all though this is only one thing ;-;)

Also a few weeks before this I did ask God if it was okay if i became trans, its been pretty difficult for me to figure it out ;-; I asked smth dumb like if its okay or not okay if i become trans, give me a sign? like crows or something.

Then i like typed back in the amazon searches? (of mine) and wus like what da heck who is this. and it just repeated itself

\- god loves you he will wait for you this is your sign!!!

he/or wtv this was said it again and again about 3 times?

then a book was added to my cart that i didnt put ;-;

its God will never give up on you by max lucado.

So this was all really weird lol qwq but more happens (ik this sounds like alot or like im lying but i promise im not, it really freaked my mom out and shes Christian ;-;)

Also at the same time my moms phone dinged up wit a notification with a bible app? she downloaded it a while ago but the timing wus odd...

it said ""ur answers wuld be answered""

ye thats alot already but the next day i think?

me and my mom were going outside so she culd get her coffee and there was a goose? a geese? idk wut its called welp but it was on our roof. ON OUR ROOF WHAT DA HECK BRU QWQ

ye that was crazy but afterrrrrrrr a few hours later

there wus a bunch of crows.

DAMN CROWS. THE FIRST THING IASSKED FOR DUMBLY

yeah they were all flying in front of our house in the sky? there wus alot of them and they were really loud and all left after a while.

its been pretty freaky these past 2 days. my mom is somewhat supportive of me being trans but would prefer i stay the way i am. im not sure if this has something to do with that.

Im js scared when i fully transition God wont love me anymore yk?

but im not fully godly or anything, i barely pray or read the bible so im not sure why so many things happened.

Is this God or a demon ? or a loved one? (sorry for the dumb questions just need help ;-;))

1kfjd4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1kfjd4p/fear_of_quitting_smoking/,Fear of quitting smoking,"The only thing that truly holds us back from quitting smoking is fear. Fear of the unknown, of not being able to enjoy coffee or food anymore, of not being able to relax, of not knowing what to do with our hands, of missing cigarette breaks at work. We’re afraid we’ll always crave or dream about cigarettes.

You might think that NOW is not the right time to quit. Maybe you're stressed, or there's a trip coming up and you want to enjoy it first. Then you’ll quit, right? Those thoughts are created by fear. 

Fear is born from thinking too far into the future. You imagine the worst-case scenarios in your head and assume they’ll happen. That creates anxiety and stress that paralyzes you and stops you from taking action (quitting smoking).

But studies show that 90% of what we imagine never actually happens! That means only 10% of the negative outcomes you fear might actually come true.

That’s why you need to come back to the present moment. Stop obsessing about what might happen. The truth is, you don’t know. Just because you read or heard about bad experiences doesn’t mean they’ll happen to you. 

When I was quitting smoking, more than half the things I read online or heard from others never happened to me. I was preparing for the worst, delaying my quit date, making excuses, but in reality, it was easier than I expected.

I used to wait for the perfect moment to quit. That moment never came. It never will. Because it doesn’t exist. 

You’ll always find an excuse. That’s why you need to act even when you feel unprepared. It’s time to stop being afraid. 

If it wasn’t the right time 5 years ago, if it's not the right time now, why do you think it will be in 5 years from now?

 What will change? 

Nothing, except maybe it’ll be too late. You might be sick by then. And you’ll think, ""I wish I listened to that guy on Reddit 5 years ago when he said the time to quit is now."" 

You think it won’t happen to you? That’s exactly what others thought too. 

Ask my dad, he still can’t believe he has tongue cancer.

Don’t wait. What’s the worst that can happen if you try? If it’s really that bad, you can always light a cigarette again tomorrow. You’ve got nothing to lose. Quitting smoking isn’t a loss, it’s freedom.

There's one quote i really like ""Action cures fear."" And it's true. 

Take the first step, stop being scared,take control over your life. Good luck!

I’d really appreciate some input on how to improve the interior of my front room. At the moment, it feels a bit thrown together — not intentionally styled, and definitely lacking cohesion. I’m not sure what direction to take it in next and could use some outside perspective.

Here’s what I’m currently working with:

* **Curtains**: These came with the place. I’m open to replacing them, but I don’t know what colour or material would make sense.
* **Velvet Sofa**: Got it at a steep discount (about 80% off), so I’m not looking to replace it
* **Flooring**: White laminate. Not my first choice, but replacing it isn’t an option right now
* **Wall Colour**: I’m open to repainting to a different colour if it would help tie things together better
* **Still Needed**: A rug, a coffee table, lampshade — I haven’t purchased as yet, as I don’t have a clear overall vision for these finer details
* **TV Console**: Willing to repaint or modify this as a DIY project if it helps the overall look
* **Artwork**: I’ve been thinking about adding a horizontal canvas piece to the right-hand wall where radiator sits, but considering if a different arrangement would work better then one large canvas?

I’m also not sure if the overall colour palette is part of the problem — there’s a lot of grey, blue, white, and black, and it might just be clashing or feeling too cold. Any thoughts on how to balance or warm it up would be appreciated.

He also doesn’t drink, but he does drink coffee. He likes food/trying new restaurants, enjoys going to the movies, and occasionally listens to podcasts.

Looking for something real, no rush, no pressure. Whether it becomes a relationship or a solid friendship, I’m all for deep connections built on trust and presence. Real talk, good vibes, and meaningful moments.

About me:

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life’s intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There’s magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you’re into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

I’m also in the middle of a fitness journey, building strength and feeling good. Thinking about my first tattoo. you got any awesome designs or stories to share?

What I’m looking for:

Someone emotionally grounded, kind, curious. Someone who doesn’t mind sitting in silence sometimes, or sharing weird thoughts and real feelings. If you’re someone who feels deeply and values presence, we might just get along.

If something here made you smile or feel seen, say hi. Or just tell me one random thing that made today a little brighter for you.

Also, there's a photo on my profile, would be great to see yours too",1,1746470357.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1kfj9t6,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1kfj9t6/dumb_queer_girl_drama/,Dumb Queer Girl Drama,"I honestly just need to try and vent this out. Please feel free to roast anyone in this story including myself. This all happened about a year ago and i’m still trying to heal. 

I’m going to set the scene… It’s Los Angeles, the film/tv industry is about to collapse after the strikes but not everyone is aware or believes this, including myself, a tv writer (now a former tv writer). It’s been about a year since I’ve worked and I’m not doing great mentally but I met someone through a friend and we clicked really well. We bumped into each other while she was drunk at a bar. I reached out to her the next day to check in about the rest of her night. We hit it off and started texting a lot. So much so that I asked if we could meet up and give our thumbs a break. She agreed. We met and chatted for three hours over coffee and a muffin. It was amazing. 

Have you ever just clicked with someone you’ve had such a nice time texting with? It was one of those. She was so sweet she even drove me to my car even though it was less than a block away. We kept chatting, and it was really nice. We had a lot of common interests. Well, my shit hit the fan. My mental health went down the drain fast when I had to pay a 10k tax bill and my agent dropped me. To make matters worse the mutual friend I had that connected me with this new friend (let’s call her Jen) didn’t want anything to do with me since I was really clinging to her for support and it was too much for her.
So. I leaned on my new friend, Jen. She was amazing once again. I was having panic attacks that would wake me up in the middle of the night so I wasn’t getting much sleep. I also had a flare up due to my chronic condition (crohn’s diseas) so I was physically in a really terrible place. I told her about the friend who dumped me and she was really sympathetic and kind, told me how she was handling things was really shitty and that she was sorry. We had a hang sesh planned but I was in such a bad place I told her we should cancel but she refused. She told me she could go to my place and we could just hang out. I asked if she was sure, she said she was. She came over and it was another lovely time. I made us dinner (it wasn’t great but she was again very kind) and it was the first time I had eaten so much in a long time. After she left, I was glowing with gratitude. I’d never had someone want to be there for me so much. Like…Ever. 

Are you feeling where this is going? I’m gonna spoil something for you. If someone has never experienced this level of support while undergoing this level of suffering, odds are they have trauma. Sooooo, of course, feelings started blooming and I knew that was wrong. She was seeing someone and it was somewhat serious. But I couldn’t keep doing what we were doing and pretend. I sent her a long rambling voice memo telling her I was catching feelings and asking if we could go about things differently so I could respect her budding relationship with Steph, the girl she was seeing who is an aquintance of mine. Sigh. Yeah. This is where the rest of the shit hit the fan. 

I don’t know why but Jen felt it necessary to send my voice message to Steph. I met up with Jen right after sending this message at a soccer game. And of course Steph shows up and is being a total dick to Jen. Just being rude and evasive and looks PISSED. I had no idea what was going on. Anyway, i get the vibe they need to talk so I leave. Jen and I keep texting. We set some boundaries and everything seems ok. Cool. We keep chatting but it’s not the same as it used to be. She’s short and doesn’t really make any conversation like she used to. This makes sense to me, she’s trying to be respectful. So we carry on and I ask if she wants to go to a movie or to a hike. I don’t know anyone who is free to join us but leave it open. She responds around 5am that she and I cannot hang out anymore and that’s she’s sorry that she told me we would be fine, but she thinks we should stop talking and hanging out.

I’m devastated. I ask her what happened and if I did something wrong. She tells me she thinks people tend to catch deeper feelings if they spend more time together and that she feels like she’s in an uncomfortable position. I  told her that if she’s uncomfortable I won’t reach out to her again and that I’m going to miss her. We have one more awkward encounter after this exchange and I never see her again. 3 months and one move across the country later, my friend who dipped out comes back. We sort of reconcile and I tell her about the very confusing thing that happened with Jen and how i’m still sad about it. She drops a fucking anvil on me. 

Turns out, ever since I sent my voice message to Jen, she’s shared every single text message I sent her to Steph and she knows that because Steph showed her the texts asking for some sort of advice?!? I was so angry and sad. Steph blocked me on both instagram accounts after one of my last texts to Jen and I never connected the dots. I felt like an absolute idiot for ever trusting Jen to respect me or my privacy. Jen works as a therapist so I assumed that she’d have healthy boundaries or just be more thoughtful in handling tough social situations respectfully but I guess they don’t teach that in college. 

And I’m emotionally kinda devastated over how much of my personal feelings she was showing to someone I barely even know and who has always been super weird with me. Steph has always been a flirt and a heavy drinker, neither of which I care for in a person and a huge reason why she was always an acquaintance.
I feel so stupid for actually thinking Jen was my friend or even just someone who cared about my emotional well-being. Idk maybe I’m in the wrong about all this. 

Anyway, thank you for listening. I’ve been struggling to trust people and open up to others again after everything, but feel free to roast me for being an idiot Lesbian who sincerely thought a pretty kind woman genuinely cared about me and magically found value in having a relationship with me. Sigh. Thank you for reading about this. You’re sweet.

Need opinions","I want to thank everyone who took the time to read my post and comment.  I was surprised and really touched by the kindness and support.  I’d been reading all the comments and responded to a few, but then my dad showed up at my door early Sunday morning, at 6:45 AM!

He came by to ask for the name and number of my tiny house builder.  I had to invite him in because I needed coffee. He said he and my mom had decided to downsize.  They were going to sell their house as well as three of their five acres.  They are keeping the two acres with the best views (my home’s prior location) and want to place a tiny house there.   It took a while, (two cups of coffee and a toasted bagel), to wrangle the following out of him, but it's a doozy.

I have to go back a bit.  When Claire received her MBA, the Ex (her mom) used her connections to get her a job at a prestigious company.  The following is going to sound bitchy but it is true.  Claire would never have hired for at that company without her mother’s help.   It was her first job.  Not her first big job.  No, it was her first job ever.  This company requires prior work experience, not totally out of left field, but they made exception for Claire.  She was working with folks who actually had work experience as well as degrees from the Ivy League and other top tier schools.  She did not attend top tier schools, although she did choose some pricey alternatives.

Claire worked there for three or four years and was moving nowhere with her career.  She told my dad it was sexism.  But then she made a lateral move into Mr. Ed’s division.   Mr. Ed had been recently widowed and they just clicked.  My dad isn’t sure how quickly Mr.  Ed progressed from boss to mentor to boyfriend, but their has gone on for years.  Except for a break during covid, it continued through her engagement and marriage.   Her career progressed rapidly as well.  However, when Mr. Ed tried to her an Assistant Vice President, HR stepped in.  Both were fired.

It gets better.  My parents and Claire arrived home the day before I made my post and Mr. Ed was waiting for them at the house.  He and Claire are engaged.   Mr. Ed is two years older than my dad.  He calls my dad “Pa”.  Dad is not amused.  Mr. Ed has had some ongoing legal issues.  He’s been in a battle with his two stepchildren and bio child over their mother’s estate.  They have been in and out of mediation for years.  It looked like most of the major issues had been resolved, until the kids found out that he had given Claire all of their mother’s jewelry.  The battle rages on.  He had also started a lawsuit against his and Claire’s former company, but the company finally settled.

My mom and dad do not like him.  Although my mom thinks he is perfect for Claire. They did not like how he spoke about his children.  He considers them disposable because Claire is more important.  And that got my parents thinking about me.  Oh, many of you were right.  They did not even notice my house was gone until their neighbor dropped by and mentioned how I was now living on the block were his son’s fiancé lives.

My dad admitted they had made mistakes with me.  My mom had stayed home because she was afraid that I would slam the door in her face.  So, my dad asked if a large check would fix things.  I told him I did not want his money.  He laughed and said it was the first time one of his children had said that to him.  He asked if I would have breakfast with them at their favorite diner on Friday at 7:00 AM. I said no because the diner does not  open until 8:00.  He said they always go early so that they can get their favorite table.  I finally agreed.  I also told them it would be easier just to ask Claire and Mr. Ed to leave.  He said they want a more minimalistic lifestyle.  They’ve been watching Youtube videos in dad’s office since Claire and Mr. Ed have taken over the family room.  Then he started asking about how long it took for my house to be built.  I went through it with him and mentioned that he could just buy used one.

I guess Friday will be a good opportunity to tell them what I think.  But I had a good opportunity yesterday and didn’t take it. I don’t know why.  Thanks again for all of your kindness.  As usual, if you have any suggestions on how I should handle the Friday breakfast, I would really appreciate it.",27,1746470320.0,MarkNarrations,7,0.92,False

I’d really appreciate some input on how to improve the interior of my front room. At the moment, it feels a bit thrown together — not intentionally styled, and definitely lacking cohesion. I’m not sure what direction to take it in next and could use some outside perspective.

Here’s what I’m currently working with:

* **Curtains**: These came with the place. I’m open to replacing them, but I don’t know what colour or material would make sense.
* **Velvet Sofa**: Got it at a steep discount (about 80% off), so I’m not looking to replace it
* **Flooring**: White laminate. Not my first choice, but replacing it isn’t an option right now
* **Wall Colour**: I’m open to repainting to a different colour if it would help tie things together better
* **Still Needed**: A rug, a coffee table, lampshade — I haven’t purchased as yet, as I don’t have a clear overall vision for these finer details
* **TV Console**: Willing to repaint or modify this as a DIY project if it helps the overall look
* **Artwork**: I’ve been thinking about adding a horizontal canvas piece to the right-hand wall where radiator sits, but considering if a different arrangement would work better then one large canvas?

1kfj8ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kfj8ld/why_is_the_jrssae_cold_brew_coffee_maker_review_a/,Why is the Jrssae Cold Brew Coffee Maker Review a Game-Changer for Coffee Lovers?,"The Jrssae B0C16VSHKZ Cold Brew Mason Coffee Maker has recently become a staple in my kitchen, especially with my fondness for cold brew coffee. Its design, functionality, and several thoughtful features have made it easy to use while delivering consistently good results. However, like any product, it has its high points and areas that could be improved, which I’ll dive into below.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Durability and aesthetics rarely come together as seamlessly as they do with this cold brew coffee maker. Constructed from sturdy soda lime glass, it feels strong in hand, and it's BPA-free, meaning I don't have to worry about harmful chemicals leaching into my coffee. The finish blends effortlessly with my kitchen decor, but it's the practical shape and size of the mason jar design that has me hooked. Fitting snugly into the door of my refrigerator, it doesn't hog shelf space. The flip-top lid is another handy touch; it stays put when pouring, so there’s no awkward wrestling with covers. That said, I noticed that sudden temperature changes (hot to cold) can make the glass prone to cracking, so it’s something to keep in mind.

**Ease of Use and Simplicity**  
Preparing a batch of cold brew using this coffee maker is genuinely hassle-free. The included mixing spoon and detailed instructions ensure even beginners can get it right. Just add coarsely ground coffee, pour water, refrigerate, and wait for the magic to happen. The stainless steel filter is conical with a super-dense 160-micron weave. This filter design deserves commendation because it allows maximum flavor extraction while ensuring no grounds sneak into your cup. Shaking the jar mid-brew is risk-free too, thanks to the silicone ring that prevents leaking, a small but game-changing feature.  

[Check Jrssae B0C16VSHKZ price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c16vshkz/)  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning is usually where many products lose points for me, but here, it’s a breeze. The disassembled parts are dishwasher-safe, though I often just rinse the stainless steel filter under running water, and voila, no coffee grounds cling to it! This ease of maintenance means I’m more inclined to use it daily without dreading the post-brew cleanup session. However, the fact that it comes with no extra filters as backups could be a slight inconvenience down the road.

**Advantages**  
Here are some standout positives:  

- Durable soda lime glass construction with BPA-free components.  
- Thoughtful design, including an ergonomic handle and a spout for easy pouring.  
- Dense 160-micron filter ensures clean flavors while keeping sediments out.  
- Refrigerator-friendly size and markings that simplify measurements.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite its strengths, there are areas it could refine:  

- The glass isn’t ideal for abrupt temperature changes, which could result in cracking under extreme conditions.  
- It would be nice if the package included additional filters or accessories for prolonged use.  

**Performance for Cold Brew Enthusiasts**  
Consistency matters when it comes to coffee, and this product nails it. Not only have I been able to recreate the smoothness of my favorite coffee shop’s cold brew right at home, but I’ve also experimented with steeping times and customized flavors, all effortlessly. Its large 64oz capacity has been a blessing on busy mornings since it stores enough to last me a couple of days. My co-workers who've tried my brews have even started dropping hints to get one of their own!

**Competitive Options**  
In comparison with other popular cold brew coffee makers, this mason-style coffee pitcher brings an impressive balance of aesthetics and functionality. For instance, I’ve tried brands like Takeya’s cold brew systems before, and while they have their perks like a modern, compact design, their capacity often feels limiting, not to mention their plastic constructs don't have the same premium glass appeal. The Oxo cold brew system produces an equally smooth brew but comes at a noticeably steeper price point. Where this mason jar shines brightest is its affordability combined with durability, giving rivals a solid run for their money.

**Cost Efficiency**  
This product more than earns its place in terms of affordability. Given how much I used to spend on daily runs to coffee shops, the savings I've seen since switching to making my cold brew at home are substantial. While the quality it delivers doesn’t quite match commercial brewing systems, it's darn close and for a fraction of the cost. It’s a smart investment for someone who loves good coffee but doesn’t want to break the bank to have it every day.

Help?,"Hai everyone, so before i say anything, i am a 13 year old trans boy. A couple of days ago me and my mom had a bit of an argument about me being trans and on the same day weird things began to happen. Uh so first was surprisingly on amazon? I wus looking for sum clothes and in my recently searches it said a few things, which i will say exactly:

\- god loves you

\- god loves you fight the devil

\- god loves you he will wait for you this is your sign!!!

this all really confused me so i asked my mom if she wrote this but she didnt. I also checked the account logs and nobody has logged into my account. And i know for sure i didnt do this (This isnt all though this is only one thing ;-;)

Also a few weeks before this I did ask God if it was okay if i became trans, its been pretty difficult for me to figure it out ;-; I asked smth dumb like if its okay or not okay if i become trans, give me a sign? like crows or something.

Then i like typed back in the amazon searches? (of mine) and wus like what da heck who is this. and it just repeated itself

\- god loves you he will wait for you this is your sign!!!

he/or wtv this was said it again and again about  3 times?

then a book was added to my cart that i didnt put ;-;

its God will never give up on you by max lucado.

So this was all really weird lol qwq but more happens (ik this sounds like alot or like im lying but i promise im not, it really freaked my mom out and shes Christian ;-;)

Also at the same time my moms phone dinged up wit a notification with a bible app? she downloaded it a while ago but the timing wus odd...

it said ""ur answers wuld be answered""

ye thats alot already but the next day i think?

me and my mom were going outside so she culd get her coffee and there was a goose? a geese? idk wut its called welp but it was on our roof. ON OUR ROOF WHAT DA HECK BRU QWQ

ye that was crazy but afterrrrrrrr a few hours later

there wus a bunch of crows.

DAMN CROWS. THE FIRST THING IASSKED FOR DUMBLY

yeah they were all flying in front of our house in the sky? there wus alot of them and they were really loud and all left after a while.

its been pretty freaky these past 2 days. my mom is somewhat supportive of me being trans but would prefer i stay the way i am. im not sure if this has something to do with that.

Im js scared when i fully transition God wont love me anymore yk?

I’d really appreciate some input on how to improve the interior of my front room. At the moment, it feels a bit thrown together — not intentionally styled, and definitely lacking cohesion. I’m not sure what direction to take it in next and could use some outside perspective.

Here’s what I’m currently working with:

* **Curtains**: These came with the place. I’m open to replacing them, but I don’t know what colour or material would make sense.
* **Velvet Sofa**: Got it at a steep discount (about 80% off), so I’m not looking to replace it
* **Flooring**: White laminate. Not my first choice, but replacing it isn’t an option right now
* **Wall Colour**: I’m open to repainting to a different colour if it would help tie things together better
* **Still Needed**: A rug, a coffee table, lampshade — I haven’t purchased as yet, as I don’t have a clear overall vision for these finer details
* **TV Console**: Willing to repaint or modify this as a DIY project if it helps the overall look
* **Artwork**: I’ve been thinking about adding a horizontal canvas piece to the right-hand wall where radiator sits, but considering if a different arrangement would work better then one large canvas? 

I’m also not sure if the overall colour palette is part of the problem — there’s a lot of grey, blue, white, and black, and it might just be clashing or feeling too cold. Any thoughts on how to balance or warm it up would be appreciated.

While I know that recipes are subjective and have variabilities, I wanted to share a starting place for those looking for one much like I did. This recipe has consistently worked well for me using light roasts and even decaf. I'm brewing B&W Rodrigo Sanchez and Manhattan El Vergel Decaf. I recommend both coffees. 

**Brewing Equipment**

* K6 Ultra. 6.5 Grind Setting
* Hario Switch with Cafec V60 02 Filters
* Fellow Stagg EKG Water Kettle
* Acacia Pearl Timer and Scale
* Orea Sense Carafe and Cup

  
**Recipe (Coffee Chronicle Recipe)**

* 200F Water
* Rinse Filter and Dump Water
* Grind 20 grams of coffee
* First Pour 160 grams, 45 seconds with Switch down position so coffee flows through
* Second Pour 160 grams, 1 min 15 seconds with Switch up position for immersion
* Release Switch at 2:00 mins and Enjoy!

**Notes**

* No need to be too precise. Tastes great even if I went over a bit on time or coffee was a little above or below 20 grams
* Coffee tastes better as it cools 
* More body than my Orea V4
* Cafec filters much faster than the stock Hario tabbed filters
* Don't agitate with decaf coffee otherwise it will stall. Pour straight down.

1kfj4zw,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitSmokingJourney/comments/1kfj4zw/fear_of_quitting_smoking/,Fear of quitting smoking,"The only thing that truly holds us back from quitting smoking is fear. Fear of the unknown, of not being able to enjoy coffee or food anymore, of not being able to relax, of not knowing what to do with our hands, of missing cigarette breaks at work. We’re afraid we’ll always crave or dream about cigarettes.

You might think that NOW is not the right time to quit. Maybe you're stressed, or there's a trip coming up and you want to enjoy it first. Then you’ll quit, right? Those thoughts are created by fear. 

Fear is born from thinking too far into the future. You imagine the worst-case scenarios in your head and assume they’ll happen. That creates anxiety and stress that paralyzes you and stops you from taking action (quitting smoking).

But studies show that 90% of what we imagine never actually happens! That means only 10% of the negative outcomes you fear might actually come true.

That’s why you need to come back to the present moment. Stop obsessing about what might happen. The truth is, you don’t know. Just because you read or heard about bad experiences doesn’t mean they’ll happen to you. 

When I was quitting smoking, more than half the things I read online or heard from others never happened to me. I was preparing for the worst, delaying my quit date, making excuses, but in reality, it was easier than I expected.

I used to wait for the perfect moment to quit. That moment never came. It never will. Because it doesn’t exist. 

You’ll always find an excuse. That’s why you need to act even when you feel unprepared. It’s time to stop being afraid. 

If it wasn’t the right time 5 years ago, if it's not the right time now, why do you think it will be in 5 years from now?

 What will change? 

Nothing, except maybe it’ll be too late. You might be sick by then. And you’ll think, ""I wish I listened to that guy on Reddit 5 years ago when he said the time to quit is now."" 

You think it won’t happen to you? That’s exactly what others thought too. 

Ask my dad, he still can’t believe he has tongue cancer.

Don’t wait. What’s the worst that can happen if you try? If it’s really that bad, you can always light a cigarette again tomorrow. You’ve got nothing to lose. Quitting smoking isn’t a loss, it’s freedom.

If you need help or advice, feel free to message me. I’d be glad to support you. You don't have to do it alone. 

There's one quote i really like ""Action cures fear."" And it's true. 

Take the first step, stop being scared,take control over your life. Good luck!

Read This Review!,"The KitchenAid KES8556SX Fully Automatic Espresso Machine is an ambitious endeavor to bring a premium espresso experience into your home. This stainless-steel beauty promises an efficient, automated process for making espresso, cappuccinos, lattes, and other coffee favorites. Having personally used it for several weeks, I feel equipped to share a detailed and honest account of its performance, quirks, and whether it lives up to the hype surrounding its launch.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unboxed it, the fully automatic espresso machine’s polished stainless steel finish and premium construction were a standout feature. It’s a hefty appliance, weighing in at over 39 pounds — a testament to its durable, metal-clad design. Sitting on my countertop, it not only attracted compliments but also commanded attention with its professional-grade look. The removable water tank, conveniently located on the side, makes refilling effortless even when I’ve placed the machine under my kitchen cabinets. However, its overall size might be a hurdle for those with compact kitchens; you’ll want to double-check the depth of your counters as it extends over 18 inches. **[Ready to buy KitchenAid KES8556SX? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ctcxnvrl/)**

**Adjustable Coffee Customization Settings**  
I thrive on coffee variety, and this machine delivers on that front. Using the touchscreen interface, I’ve tailored drinks to my liking, adjusting strength, temperature, and length effortlessly. It even allows saving personalized recipes — a significant plus for households with multiple coffee drinkers. This feature has proved invaluable for weekday mornings when I need to grab my preferred Americano quickly, and my partner can effortlessly switch to her latte settings. The automatic milk frothing worked like a charm, producing consistent results for cappuccinos, although the foam might not satisfy hardcore froth lovers.

**Strong Points**  
- Robust stainless steel construction ensures long-lasting use.  
- An intuitive touchscreen interface makes drink customization straightforward.  
- The removable bean hopper simplifies switching between bean types for personalized experiences.  
- Compact yet efficient grinder that produces perfectly dosed coffee grounds automatically.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The machine's depth may overshadow narrower countertops.  
- The milk frothing function, while efficient, doesn’t compare to manual steaming wands.  
- Coffee temperature might not satisfy those who prefer a piping-hot brew.

**Performance and User Experience**  
Making espressos daily has exposed me to the real practicality of this device. The machine’s grinder is more consistent than I expected, grinding fresh beans every time and eliminating the guesswork. I appreciated the integrated smart dosing system, which ensures consistent quality in each cup. However, I noticed that while the machine heats the water quickly for the brew cycle, the default coffee temperature isn’t as high as I anticipated. That said, it does allow me to adjust the temperature through the settings, which is fantastic for finicky coffee enthusiasts like me.

Cleaning after every coffee session was simpler than I imagined. The milk hose, for instance, only requires a quick rinse, and the cleaning functions are automated to a large extent. There was a day, however, when the auto-rinse function triggered three times in a row, which left me mopping up more water than I’d like to. That quirk aside, it has been pretty fuss-free overall.

**Challengers**  
Having used a Jura in the office and a Breville at a friend’s house, the KitchenAid KES8556SX holds its own among reputable competitors in the fully automatic espresso machine category. Compared to Jura’s pricier models, this one provides a similar flavor profile at a significantly lower cost. It does fall slightly short on the crema production, which Jura machines excel at. When compared to Breville machines, the KitchenAid triumphs in ease of use with its presets but lacks the same degree of manual control over froth texture. For buyers considering Bosch models, this espresso maker delivers hotter coffee and better crema at the expense of being slightly bulkier.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
The price point for this espresso maker sits comfortably within the mid-tier range for super-automatic machines. Given its ability to make a variety of quality drinks without hassle, I found it to provide solid value for money. However, those who crave manual adjustments for texturing milk or creating ultra-specialty drinks might see more appeal in pricier alternatives. As a frequent coffee drinker, I view it as a cost-effective way to bid farewell to my daily trips to the café. **[Score a deal on KitchenAid KES8556SX: Check Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ctcxnvrl/)**",1,1746469834.0,CoffeeBrewerReviews,0,1.0,False

I was reading the scene where Richard picks Charles up from the police station and Charles starts to reveal a few things on the way home:

""I had to deal with the police. He got the credit, but I was the one who spent hours at the station drinking coffee and trying to make friends. It was up to me to convince them we were just a group of normal young people. The same goes for the FBI, which was worse. I saved everyone’s ass, you know, always alert, having to do everything right, always considering their point of view.
We have to hit the nail on the head with these people. You can’t slip up for even a second — you have to be communicative and open, but also concerned, without getting nervous. And I could barely lift the cup without spilling coffee, I had a few panic attacks, thought I was going to faint or have a nervous breakdown or something. Do you know how hard that is? Do you really think Henry would lower himself to do something like that? No way. It would’ve been easy for me, of course, but he wouldn’t even bother. Those people had never seen anyone like Henry in their lives. Do you know what he was worried about? Whether he had brought the right book, if Homer would make a better impression than Thomas Aquinas. He seems like he came from another planet. If he had been the only one dealing with the police, we’d have ended up in the gas chamber.""

I CAN'TT.
Charles was really smart during the investigation and he was the one asking Henry if all that was really necessary, nearly crying, multiple times, nervous, saying they’d all lost their minds. He seemed to question and oppose the plan, but in the end, as he and Richard admitted to each other, they all followed Henry without even knowing why they were doing it.

**❗ Why I’m Offering This at a Great Price (Urgent):**

I recently bought a condo and moved out, but I forgot to cancel the lease renewal — so the new lease already started. I’m now stuck with a full-year lease unless someone takes over. That’s why I’m offering it **$135/month cheaper** than the original price, and also open to **month-to-month rental** for extra flexibility.

It’s a great unit, fully furnished, clean, and ready to go. I just need to transfer it ASAP. First come, first served!

I joked, ""How about both? Let's live dangerously!"" He laughed and said, ""Alright, but no turning into a Tasmanian devil!"" 😂

We kinda ended up in this mini competition of who could come up with more ""dangerous"" coffee orders, resulting in some wild combos like ""mocha with chili flakes and a hint of mystery syrup"". It was so silly, but honestly, it totally made my morning. I've never left a coffee shop smiling so much, and idk, it's those little interactions that just stick with you.

1kfiqyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/1kfiqyj/a_97year_old_mans_perspective_on_american/,A 97-year old man's perspective on American streetcars being ripped out of his hometown,"I met my partner's family for the first time this past weekend, and his grandfather is 97 years old. He's a lively and passionate man who talked more than any senior I've ever come to know. The conversation moved toward the topic of transportation, and he had a *lot* to say. 

He grew up in a small town outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. According to his recounting of his childhood, there were multiple streetcar lines in his town alone, and plenty of opportunity to go into the city or another suburb if one ever needed. They came extremely often and were always on time. As a child, he would take these streetcars alone to get from place to place and never had an issue. He described it as the best decades to be alive. He also enjoys long-distance train travel. A big attraction for him is the ability to stand up and move about train cars, get a snack or coffee and be able to stand and look out the window or make conversation with the staff on board.

He then brought up how all of the streetcars were replaced with buses, and the buses were always late, they were loud, and they were uglier than the streetcars. More people got cars and now the buses are stuck in traffic. Some of his favorite destinations were destroyed because people needed to park their vehicles. Before the abundance of cars, parking was provided in *very* strict timeframes but was not too expensive. Now, since parking takes up so much land, parking is available everywhere, but the price of parking is extremely high in cities because there's 20 cars where multiple businesses and residents could be paying rent to the city. 

It was sad to hear him say ""I've never seen anything move as backwards as this country's transportation system."" To know that he experienced local and regional transportation at its peak and to see it being constantly strangled by men 40 years younger than him trying to fill their pockets with the cash of the oil and automobile lobby. He saw society evolve in some ways but regress in so many others. He didn't know about the General Motors Conspiracy, but after I explained what it is, he confirmed that it makes a lot of sense and is still going on.

It was a very valuable conversation and it was insightful to hear about the ""good old days"" from someone who actually experienced them. ",132,1746469088.0,fuckcars,7,0.99,False

i’ve recently realised that to me adhd is constant racing thoughts, the inability to self motivate and constantly needing stimulation, and it confused me at first because to outsiders, family and myself i have always appeared lazy (skipped school, quit jobs, not overly active or interested in putting myself out there), i’m not overly proactive or the type to take much initiative. i’ve only just made the realisation that having autism and adhd is incredibly conflicting and has made it much harder to identify these feelings and needs; my autism makes me not want to engage with others or leave the house but my adhd craves stimulation and spontaneity. 
as a teen i would drink multiple coffees a day because it relaxed me, now realising a lot of people with adhd become relaxed by stimulants instead of overly stimulated. ive recently been taking a lot of drugs, including stimulants, only recently realising the drugs stimulate my brain which simultaneously relaxes me, making time go by quicker and quiet the constant food noise and cravings for stimulation i have when i’m sat doing nothing or have boring plans.

ive always struggled with mental health and for years tried to identify what i could possibly have, thinking i had bpd or bipolar but finally coming to the realisation im autistic and getting a diagnosis. through all that research i just never identified with the oversimplified stereotype of ADHD therefore never researched it much, so now that i realise so much of my struggle is due to adhd its surprising and confusing and i wonder how much more of my life and emotional regulation is disturbed by adhd and not solely the autism. also does adhd medication help with these feelings of discomfort and irritability? anyone else relate?

That’s why I’m offering it **$135/month cheaper** than the original price, and also open to **month-to-month rental** for extra flexibility.

It’s a great unit, fully furnished, clean, and ready to go. I just need to transfer it ASAP. First come, first served!
