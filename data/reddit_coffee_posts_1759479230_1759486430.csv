As someone whos been regularly converting audio files for video projects for over three years, I've learned a thing or two about it. Why specifically WAV to MP3? What tools should you use? I try to answer some of these questions.

# Does it matter which software you use?

Kinda.. Buuut for low bitrates it doesn’t really change the picture that much. Still, having a user-friendly, intuitive program at hand sounds a lot better than going through tech stuff, yeh?

# Is converting WAV files to MP3 really the most efficient way? 

It just depends. WAV files offer high-quality audio but take up significantly more space. MP3 however balances quality and storage nicely—perfect in variuos cases, whether you're mastering an audio album or simply gathering podcasts to listen to on your morning travel to work.

The thing is MP3 is outdated and there are significantly better alternatives today. AAC, FLAC/ALAC, and other newer audio codecs can give you better quality. Again it’s only when you go higher bitrates it becomes noticeable.

But we don’t really care, do we? 

# My go-to way how to convert WAV to MP3

I've tried plenty of software—online converters, free tools, complicated DAWs. Never again. Movavi Video Converter has been my mainstay lately (using it for over a year now). It's straightforward, reliable, and honestly idiot-proof (important for me, seriously trust lmao). 

The steps don't differ much from other software; just drag-and-drop your files, pick the output format as MP3, and leave the rest to do its job. Or you can tweak settings like bitrate, adjust volume, correct the noise lvl, or simply trim.

# Some efficiency hacks to help convert faster

* **Batch processing is your buddy:** Don't ever convert files one-by-one. Drop a batch, set your output, and let it run while you grab coffee.
* **Preset settings:** If you're converting regularly, set up a preset once, and never adjust it again. 
* **Check the bitrate:** The average listener won't be able to pick up much of a difference unless the bitrate is significantly lower than what they're used to. Don't waste your time on lowering too much.

Instead, the doctor there gave me unsolicited advice on how uneven and thin my lips were and how she’d fix them with filler.

1nwuwqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1nwuwqw/lisa_wingate_books_in_order/,Lisa Wingate Books In Order,"Hey everyone! I just finished a truly impactful book by Lisa Wingate, and I've been wanting to chat about it with some fellow book lovers. If you're looking to dive into her world or just want to see what other amazing stories she's penned, you can check out a comprehensive list here: [Lisa Wingate Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/lisa-wingate-books-in-order/). The specific book I want to discuss is *Before We Were Yours*.

This story is a powerful, dual-timeline narrative inspired by the real-life scandal of the Tennessee Children's Home Society, which kidnapped and illegally sold children from the 1920s to the 1950s. It follows the harrowing journey of Rill Foss and her siblings, torn from their family on a Mississippi River houseboat, and present-day Avery Stafford, a successful attorney who uncovers dark family secrets that connect back to these events. It’s a book that grips you from the very first page, pulling you into a world of hardship, resilience, and the enduring search for truth.

What really stood out to me was how Wingate crafted the characters. Rill's story, set in the past, is utterly heartbreaking but also incredibly inspiring. Her determination to protect her younger siblings in the face of unimaginable cruelty is something you won't soon forget. You truly feel her pain, her fear, and her fierce love. Then there's Avery, whose journey of discovery in the present is equally compelling. She starts off as someone seemingly having it all, but her quest for answers forces her to re-evaluate everything she thought she knew about her family and herself. The way these two timelines eventually weave together is just masterfully done.

The writing style is very evocative and immersive. Wingate has a way of painting vivid pictures with her words, whether it's the rustic life on the river or the chilling details of the orphanage. The pacing keeps you constantly engaged; you'll find yourself flipping pages late into the night, desperate to know what happens next. The emotional depth is profound—I found myself tearing up multiple times, but there's also a strong undercurrent of hope and the triumph of the human spirit. While not a ""thriller"" in the traditional sense, the unfolding mystery and the psychological tension of the children's plight definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.

If I had to pick something I didn't *love* quite as much, it would be that some of the resolutions, particularly in the present-day storyline, felt a *little* neat. Given the enormity of the historical injustice, I sometimes wished for a bit more ambiguity or perhaps a slightly less polished ending for Avery's personal journey. However, this is a minor point in an otherwise stellar novel.

**So, would I recommend it? Absolutely!** This book is perfect for anyone who enjoys historical fiction, family sagas, and stories that delve deep into human emotions and resilience. If you appreciate a strong narrative with a touch of mystery and a real-world historical backdrop, you're in for a treat. It’s a fantastic entry point into Lisa Wingate's work, and if you enjoy this one, you'll definitely want to explore more of her compelling stories, many of which you can discover on this list: [Lisa Wingate Books In Order](https://pdfhive.com/lisa-wingate-books-in-order/).

### **A Little Guide for New Readers:**

If you're just getting into reading or want to pick up a book more often, here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Start with a Genre You Like:** Think about your favorite movies or TV shows. Do you love suspense? Fantasy? Real-life drama? Pick a book from that genre. It's an easy way to find something you'll naturally be interested in.
2.  **It's Okay to Put a Book Down:** Don't feel guilty if a book isn't grabbing you. Life's too short to force yourself through something you're not enjoying. Move on! There are thousands of other books waiting.
3.  **Read in Small Chunks:** You don't need to read for hours. Even 15-20 minutes a day can make a huge difference. Before bed, during your commute, or with your morning coffee—find what works for you.
4.  **Join a Community:** Like right here on Reddit! Talking about books with others can make the experience even more fun and help you discover new titles.
5.  **Embrace the Journey:** Reading is a personal adventure. There's no right or wrong way to do it. Just open a book and let your mind wander.

Reading can open up whole new worlds, and I genuinely believe there's a perfect book out there for everyone. If *Before We Were Yours* sounds like your kind of story, I truly encourage you to give it a read. It’s a profound and unforgettable experience. Happy reading, everyone!

1nwuw3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nwuw3a/how_much_better_are_top_end_machines_for_straight/,How much better are top end machines for straight espresso?,"Hi all,

I am currently running a Breville barista express and a Starseeker e55 grinder. My current daily usually looks like making 2-3 espressos in the morning and 2 milk based coffees early afternoon. 

I'm following all the right prep steps and really enjoy the espresso I am getting from my setup. I have completed the OPV mod to get 9-10 bars and my shots are very consistent. The only downside to my current setup is the milk frothing takes around 2 minutes if I'm doing milk for two.

My question is if I choose to upgrade to a top end machine like say a profitec pro 600 am I going to notice a massive difference in my espresso shots flavour? Money isn't really a factor but at the same time I don't want to outlay a decent amount for a minimal gain. I would love to be able to compare a shot with my setup vs a top end machine with the same beans and grinder but I don't really see how that would be possible.

Any input would be much appreciated thank you.  ",2,1759485515.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1nwuv6q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwuv6q,"Cycling the North Coast 500, September 2025","Here’s a my report from cycling the North Coast 500 this September. Easy enough logistics for this tour, flew return Warsaw-Amsterdam-Inverness. KLM did a good job transporting my bike both ways, cost about 50 eur for each leg. Nice to start and finish at the same location, stayed in a hostel in Inverness first night and asked them to keep my box for when I return.
Bike. Another trip with my Marin Four Corners, which I’ve equipped with Schwalbe Marathon Mondials now. Very very happy with what I brought. This was my 4th tour and definitely the lightest so far. I used every single item (except for those that you hope you won’t need), and if I had brought anything extra, these would’ve been luxury to me (my aeropress is not a luxury, its a necessity, ha). With my new ultralight sleeping system - Durston X Dome tent, Turbat sleeping bag and Big Agnes mat, I managed to squeeze all of this (and a Nemo pillow!) into one dry bag that’s on the handlebars. First trip where I managed not to take back panniers, in the back I just got a 36l backpack.
I took 2 weeks to complete the loop. This is very generous, you can easily have a few rest days. A week would also be somewhat ok if you are willing to cover more distance. Anything shorter I’d consider a rush. I average about 70 km a day.
Road. Basically 100% paved and good quality. You can use any tyres really. Roads are often narrow with passing places for cars, drivers are usually considerate. Before the trip I was told that the NC500 can get crowded - I was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case, maybe around Inverness there is some traffic, but in general roads are pretty empty. I did skip John O’Groats and cut to Helmsdale though, as I was told that this bit is the worst in terms of traffic. I went clockwise for better winds, which mostly turned out to be good advice. I did have 2 days with biggest headwinds of my life when I just wanted to cry.
Camping. I guess I did 50/50 when it comes to camping/booking places. I followed a simple rule - if it’s a nice evening, I camp. If it’s pouring down, I don’t - just get a guesthouse or a hostel. The trip is supposed to be enjoyable after all. Was pretty lucky with accommodation I think, whenever I needed one, there was always something available. Really liked the Scotland Youth Hostels (and their prices, haha, about 30 pounds a night, compared to at least 100 for a guesthouse/hotel).
Ok, the road! The views! What can I say, Scotland is epic!!! Wonderful ride! Just prepare for the absolutely mixed weather and you’ll have a blast. There is definitely quite a bit of climbing, but totally manageable (biggest climbing day was 1500 m total) and definitely worth it! I loved the huge, open, desolate spaces. The lochs are stunning. This will be one of my favourites for the years to come, for sure.
What else…a bit of planning required for food, but nothing too crazy. Some nice cafes and restaurants here and there, I’ll link some below. I did carry a water filter but only used it once or twice. Oh yeah. Midges. They’re there (not always though). They suck, I hate them. Get a midge net, easily found in Inverness.
I followed the route from komoot with some modifications by the end as I was staying twice with warmshower hosts and had to detour. Very little navigation required, I think you could just follow the signs if you wanted to.

1nwurya,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwurya,My first arrhythmia with my Apple Watch,"During this past month, I have had some stress due to personal and work reasons. I have been having some strange palpitations with no or very light symptoms. In general, the palpitations were very short, and since my watch's ECG is recently working weirdly, I couldn't record them. Two weeks ago, I had a longer event that I managed to record with the Watch. I passed through the app I am working on, and interestingly, it recognized the irregular rhythm in the ECG.   
  
A week ago, I went to the cardiologist. After showing him the ECG strip and telling him about my family history of AFIB, he said that it might be AFIB or an early phase. The ECG looks more like a series of PACs with a short SVT. I got a 24h Holter ECG, and it came completely normal: 6 PACs, 1 PVC, and some sinus bradycardia during sleeping :). Honestly, since I got the arrhythmia, I have been more conscious of my health and stress. I have quit coffee (it really affects my stress levels), try to sleep better, and take it easy. I really believe it has been an episode of stress. However, it is not bad to have an Apple Watch to take a look at my ECGs and check the HRVs and some stats in the App. ",1,1759485095.0,AFIB,0,1.0,False

“[Frag…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUdaBxJkhhI&list=RDbUdaBxJkhhI&start_radio=1) Fucking nerve dammage. Frag this, I hate my fragging useless body.” *Donavan cursed as his trembling fingers failed to roll yet another joint of deepweed, tearing the thin fabric of the rolling paper and sending the dried poor quality kelp mixed with marjuana bud onto the coffee table in front of him at the flop house he was staying at. For a second he closed his eyes and did everything he could not to weep. As his clumsy fingers reached out to scoop up what remained, shakily lit an Aztechnology branded cigarette and clamping it between his teeth as he continued the process of rolling the remainder of his deepweed into joints to sell at a coming show.* 

*He was scorched, bad, and suffering from intense neurofeedback withdrawals. He didn’t have any nuyen for another tripwire, and wasn’t going to get another one out of his dealer until paid what he owed. All he had to his name was the clothes on his back, what chrome he hadn’t sold, a backpack full of meager possessions and dubious electronics and the deep weed his dealer had given him to offload. He’d already smoked more of the product than he could afford, lost his job, and been kicked out of his band even with a synthjack his guitar playing sucked.* 

*He was desperate, and destitute, it wasn’t until he gave up and asking god or the devil for help and started praying to the spirits that he found the strength to finish rolling the last of joints, with just enough time to take the bus downtown to try sell what he could at the clubs he wasn’t banned from.* 

*If just fucking rolling the damn joints wasn’t hard enough, selling them was a nightmare. He was neurodivergent to begin with and so burnt out on beetles that talking to people without freaking them out by the way his eyes moved or his inability to modulate tone like a fucking normal metahuman and that was on a good night, tonight he was fucking unshowered,unshaved, and dealing with a mind-breaking migrain from withdrawls. By the grace of ghost he made it to club Pen in time to run into an old friend who worked the shadows and was willing to share some nova with him and talk about the girl he used to date like two years ago, it was enough to give him the edge to actually sell the rest of the joints before the clubs closed.* 

*By dawn Donavan was sitting on the porch of his dealer's house with a fully loaded basic credstick, smoking the last of his pack of Aztlan Red’s and waiting for his Blood Mountain Boys who supplied him with his chips to arrive. Around than the novacoke crash hit him and thought became impossibly difficult, burning himself with his cigarette as he entered a daze of pain and disorientation. Time lost all meaning and finally his dealer arrived in a yerzed out SUV with Red and Brown colors.*

“Hoi, Donni, good to see you chummer, what’s good?” *His dealer Sear got out of the SUV to greet him, she was wearing neo-tribal facepaint, violet fiberoptic hair down to her waist and sporting a necklace maid of chain sporting teeth and old razorblades. Donnivan just looked up at her, too strung out to trust himself to speak his native language and just offered the credstick to her.* 

“Than’s Donni, you’re a sweetheart. That covers what you owe me for the deepweed and your debt. Are you looking for direct input or a dreamdeck?” 


*Donni just sighed, he was so close, he tried and failed to keep the tears from his eyes.* 
“Eithers fine, my sim module’s still working so I can handle dreamdeck if you got anything professional.”*

*“Oh, yeah, you know what? Just because you’re such a sweet thang, I’ll spare you a burner and give you one of these brand new Dreamdecks tripwires we just got in. It’s got five plays on it, so that should last you a while if you’re smart, which I know you are Donni.” Sear and her crew lead him into the living room of their suburban home, it was filled with an overstuffed leather couch, a state of the art trideo set, assault weapons on the wall, and tactical reinforcement over the external walls, as well as an impressive mural done in spray paint on the ceiling. And more importantly a duffel bag filled with dreamdeck chips sitting on the coffee table.*  

“Sounds nova.” *The words sounded hallow, but behind them the deepest glimmer of hope flickered in Donnovan’s soul, not only was the pain of withdrawals was about to go away but he had infinity of time away from his dead-ass end existence awaiting him the moment he jacked into that chip.* 

“Is it okay if I slot it here?” *He asked pathetically, and she laughed agreeing. He awkwardly took a seat on the sofa, pulled out his backpack and pulled out a DIY hotmodded sim-module he’d jailbroken himself the last time he was fully lucid and plugged in the sleek looking chip into it before shakily plugging his datajack into the output port. A few minutes later he was convulsing heavily as his synapses were bombarded with [better than life signals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JETg941y0j4&list=RDJETg941y0j4&index=1) that sent the beetlehead into totally different cosmos of sensation, where reality flowed like a river and he could experience lifetimes of ecstasy experiencing realities that defied all logical explanation inhabiting any body he wanted and doing as he pleased in a world that made sense only to him where time obeyed his whims and the world conformed to his every desire.* 

*The trip lasted about an hour, after which he fell asleep from exhaustion. He awoke the gangsters were busy watching the trideo and Donnavan’s hands wern’t shaking as badly as they had before. More importantly, a new understanding had come over him. He could overcome his weakness and become something better, needed to find a militia that would take him, or start one himself if need be. He suddenly knew what to say, and the right data-havens to go on to propel himself out of his current life and become something dangerous, something powerful, part of something bigger than himself. He didn’t know why he knew it and he didn’t care, just that this was who he was and what his drive was now, he was going to become a street soldier and get the wear and training to overcome the obstacles that were facing him, and nothing was going to stop him.* 

*Everything was going to be okay.*

1nwun5y,https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2025/oct/02/the-reading-room-bookstore-and-bar-opening-soon/,The Reading Room bookstore and bar opening soon in Chattanooga | Chattanooga Times Free Press,"The Reading Room, a bookstore-bar hybrid, is set to open soon at 3210 Brainerd Road, in the Old Town section of Brainerd.

Owner Linden Marno-Feree, who has experience in both bookselling and bartending, said she aimed to create a unique space that combined the two industries.

""When you read about authors, especially American authors, of the last 100, 150 years, they're drinkers,"" she said. ""Also, the vibe of a cool used bookstore and of a funky, divey bar are very similar. So I decided to marry the two of them.""

The hybrid model also makes the business more economically sustainable, Marno-Feree said.

While working at the Harvard bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she saw how the rise of Amazon really started to threaten the survival of the industry.

“I've worked in several bars that, like a lot of them, also haven't had an easy time staying alive,"" she said. ""So it feels like to combine revenue streams is really the way to go. They have to buttress each other.""

Another goal was to create a mellow bar atmosphere that's lacking in Chattanooga, a place where people can drink and just hang out with their friends, read a book, space out or look at pictures.

“I think of it as like a little oasis, a place where you can really escape the day-to-day grind and take a break,"" Marno-Feree said. ""In Chattanooga in particular, we don't have a lot of spaces where people can relax in a bar. A bar is seen as a space to get rowdy and party, and that's not what bars are in some other cities.""

She said she chose Brainerd because she considers it a frontier, with the Brainerd tunnel serving as a border that seems to separate it from downtown and the rest of the city.

“We're putting them together, letting everyone know it's all Chattanooga,"" she said. ""We've reached a point in Chattanooga where a lot of places are being sort of overpriced and built up, and it's time for this area to blossom""

Residential areas surround both sides of Brainerd Road, which doesn't have many food and beverage options, Marno-Feree said.

Books line the walls from floor to ceiling of the 1,000-square-foot space, which seats about 40. Options include small tables for two, booths made from church pews and a larger table for a group.

The books now filling the shelves were purchased from Chattanooga Public Library Foundation sales, but Marno-Feree said that once those start to clear out, she plans to create a system to allow people to sell their books for cash or credit.

“ Books are like clothes,"" she said. ""It turns out everybody buys a lot of them and then doesn't know what to do with them after they've read them or used them.""



Patrons are welcome to read books at the bar without buying them, but they have to pay for books they take with them, Marno-Feree said.

The build-out of the space was done by Brian Hennen and Lewis Armistead, who also did the build-out of Boneyard bar on downtown Chattanooga's Station Street.

Armistead and Hennen are opening another hybrid business, a bar and music store called Shredder's Lair, a block down from the Reading Room, she said.

A pizza place is also opening on the same stretch of Brainerd Road, and Marno-Feree plans to offer pizza from the new restaurant once it's established.



To start, the Reading Room will have three employees serving drinks from the full bar, as well as coffee, tea and other nonalcoholic drinks.

Hours of operation will be from noon to midnight Thursday through Saturday, but she plans to eventually be open seven days a week.

The opening of the business was delayed by two weeks to finalize approval by the Chattanooga Beer Board, Marno-Feree said, and people can follow the Reading Room's Instagram to be informed of the opening date.

1nwukua,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1nwukua/best_vpns_for_pc/,Best VPNs for PC,"Every day, cybersecurity researchers detect **560,000 new pieces of malware**—and PCs are the primary target. With Windows privilege escalation vulnerabilities accounting for 40% of all system vulnerabilities and remote work breaches affecting 62% of companies, your desktop or laptop needs more protection than ever before.

Here's the reality: over **1.75 billion people worldwide use VPNs** to protect their online activities, and 72% of PC users specifically rely on VPN software for encrypted browsing. But with cybercrime costs projected to exceed **$10.5 trillion annually by 2025**, choosing the right VPN for your PC isn't just about privacy—it's about protecting your digital life from real, evolving threats.

In this guide, we'll examine the best VPNs for PC in 2025, focusing on Windows and Mac protection with the security features, performance metrics, and threat intelligence you need to make an informed decision.

# Why Your PC Needs a VPN in 2025

PCs face unique security challenges that make VPN protection essential. Unlike mobile devices with sandboxed apps, desktop operating systems grant broader system access, making them prime targets for sophisticated attacks. Consider these current threats:

**Remote Work Vulnerabilities**: With 62% of companies experiencing security breaches related to remote working, your home network has become a critical weak point. Poorly secured WiFi, multiple unknown users, and lower policy adherence create entry points for malware infections. A VPN encrypts your connection and masks your IP address, making it significantly harder for attackers to intercept your work communications or locate your device.

**Public WiFi Exploitation**: Half of all VPN users activate their protection specifically for public WiFi networks—and for good reason. Coffee shops, airports, and hotel networks are notorious hunting grounds for man-in-the-middle attacks and packet sniffing. Without encryption, your passwords, banking details, and private communications are exposed to anyone monitoring the network.

**ISP Tracking and Throttling**: Your Internet Service Provider can see every website you visit and often throttles bandwidth during streaming, gaming, or large downloads. A VPN prevents ISP monitoring by encrypting your traffic, ensuring your online activities remain private while preventing discriminatory speed limitations.

**Malware Distribution**: With over 1 billion malware programs currently in circulation and Trojans accounting for 58% of all computer malware, PCs face constant infection attempts. While VPNs aren't antivirus solutions, premium services like NordVPN include Threat Protection Pro™, which blocks malicious websites, prevents tracker infections, and stops malware downloads before they reach your system.

**Geographic Content Restrictions**: Many streaming services, news outlets, and websites restrict content based on IP location. Whether you're traveling abroad or simply want access to region-specific content, a VPN allows you to route your connection through servers in 100+ countries.

# Essential VPN Features for PC Security

Not all VPNs provide adequate PC protection. When evaluating options, prioritize these critical security features:

**Military-Grade Encryption**: Look for **AES-256-bit encryption**—the same standard used by governments and financial institutions. This encryption is virtually uncrackable with current technology, ensuring your data remains secure even if intercepted.

**Automatic Kill Switch**: If your VPN connection drops unexpectedly, a kill switch immediately blocks all internet traffic, preventing your real IP address and unencrypted data from being exposed. This is crucial for protecting sensitive work communications or financial transactions.

**DNS and IP Leak Protection**: DNS leaks occur when your device accidentally sends DNS requests outside the encrypted VPN tunnel, potentially exposing which websites you visit. Quality VPNs include leak protection to ensure all traffic remains encrypted and routed through VPN servers.

**Verified No-Logs Policy**: Many VPN providers claim not to log user activity, but only independently audited services can verify this commitment. Look for providers with third-party audits confirming they don't collect browsing history, connection timestamps, IP addresses, or traffic data.

**Modern VPN Protocols**: The protocol determines how your data is encrypted and transmitted. **WireGuard** offers the best balance of speed and security for most PC users, while OpenVPN provides maximum compatibility and battle-tested security. Avoid outdated protocols like PPTP, which have known vulnerabilities.

**Multi-Device Protection**: The average household connects 8+ devices simultaneously. Choose a VPN that allows multiple connections so you can protect your desktop, laptop, smartphone, and tablet with a single subscription.

# Best VPNs for PC in 2025

After extensive testing and analysis of current threat data, here are the top VPN services for PC protection:

# NordVPN: Best Overall VPN for PC

**Why it leads**: NordVPN dominates the PC VPN market with a 17% market share in the United States, and for good reason—it delivers the complete security package specifically optimized for desktop users.

**Key PC Features**:

* **7,000+ servers** in 118 countries provide extensive connection options with minimal congestion
* **Threat Protection Pro™** blocks malware, trackers, and malicious ads before they reach your PC—essentially giving you integrated antivirus protection
* **NordLynx protocol** (built on WireGuard) delivers exceptional speeds with minimal performance impact, ideal for resource-intensive tasks
* **Dedicated Windows and Mac apps** with intuitive interfaces and advanced customization options
* **Automatic kill switch** and **DNS leak protection** prevent accidental data exposure
* **Verified no-logs policy** with independent audits by PricewaterhouseCoopers
* **Up to 10 simultaneous connections** to protect all your devices

**Performance**: In independent testing, NordVPN maintained speeds suitable for 4K streaming, online gaming, and large file downloads with minimal latency increase. The Threat Protection Pro feature adds negligible overhead while significantly enhancing security.

**Pricing**: Plans start at $3.09/month for 2-year subscriptions, with a 30-day money-back guarantee for risk-free testing.

# ExpressVPN: Premium Option with Maximum Speed

For users prioritizing raw performance, ExpressVPN delivers the **fastest connection speeds** we tested, with only an 8-11% speed reduction even on distant servers. The proprietary Lightway protocol uses minimal code for efficient data transmission, and automatic obfuscation on all servers helps bypass VPN blocks on restrictive networks. With 3,000 servers in 105 countries and excellent customer support, it's ideal for power users who need consistent reliability.

# CyberGhost: Best for Beginners

CyberGhost's user-friendly interface makes it perfect for VPN newcomers, with specialized streaming and gaming servers clearly labeled for easy selection. The Windows and Mac apps require minimal configuration while still providing robust security. At 11,690 servers in 100 countries and a generous **45-day money-back guarantee**, it offers excellent value for casual PC users focused primarily on content access and basic privacy.

# Private Internet Access: Maximum Customization

Advanced users appreciate PIA's extensive configuration options, with customizable encryption levels, port forwarding support, and detailed connection logs for troubleshooting. The massive network of 29,650 servers includes options in all 50 US states, making it excellent for accessing region-specific content. Unlimited simultaneous connections mean you can protect every device in your household without restrictions.

# How to Choose the Right PC VPN

Consider these factors when evaluating VPN services for your specific needs:

**Speed Requirements**: If you game online, stream in 4K, or frequently download large files, prioritize VPNs with WireGuard or proprietary speed-optimized protocols. Test during your money-back guarantee period to confirm performance meets your expectations.

**Security vs. Convenience**: Some VPNs offer advanced features like split tunneling, customizable encryption, and multi-hop connections. Beginners should focus on services with strong default settings, while experienced users may want granular control.

**Server Location Strategy**: Choose VPNs with servers near your physical location for optimal speeds, plus servers in countries with content you want to access. More servers in a location generally means less congestion and better performance.

**Budget Considerations**: While free VPNs exist, 28% of users rely on them despite significant security risks. Free services often log and sell user data, inject ads, or provide inadequate encryption. Quality paid VPNs cost less than $5/month for long-term plans—a small price for legitimate security.

**Use Case Alignment**: Gamers need low latency and DDoS protection, streamers require reliable geo-unblocking, and remote workers must ensure business-grade encryption and leak protection. Match your VPN choice to your primary activities.

# PC VPN Setup Best Practices

Maximize your VPN's effectiveness with these configuration tips:

**Enable Kill Switch First**: Before connecting to your VPN for the first time, activate the kill switch in settings. This ensures you're never accidentally exposed if the connection drops during use.

**Verify Leak Protection**: Use online leak testing tools (like ipleak.net) to confirm your VPN isn't leaking DNS requests or exposing your real IP address. Test immediately after connecting and periodically thereafter.

**Optimize Protocol Selection**: Most modern VPNs default to the best protocol automatically, but you can manually select WireGuard for speed or OpenVPN for maximum compatibility if needed.

**Configure Split Tunneling**: If certain applications don't work properly with VPN (like banking apps requiring your actual location), use split tunneling to exclude them from the VPN connection while keeping everything else protected.

**Enable Automatic Connection**: Set your VPN to launch and connect automatically when your PC starts. This ensures you're always protected, even if you forget to manually activate the VPN.

# Common PC VPN Myths Debunked

**Myth: ""VPNs Make Everything Slower""** **Reality**: Modern VPN protocols like WireGuard introduce minimal performance overhead—often less than 10% speed reduction on nearby servers. While encryption requires some processing power, the impact on everyday browsing is negligible with quality providers.

**Myth: ""Free VPNs Are Good Enough""** **Reality**: Free VPN services must profit somehow, and that often means logging and selling your data, injecting advertisements, or providing inadequate security. Research shows that many free VPNs contain malware or use aggressive tracking. The cost of quality paid VPNs (under $5/month) is minimal compared to the security risks of free alternatives.

**Myth: ""VPNs Make You 100% Anonymous""** **Reality**: VPNs significantly enhance privacy by encrypting traffic and masking your IP address, but they're not complete anonymity solutions. Websites can still use browser fingerprinting, cookies, and account logins to track you. VPNs should be part of a comprehensive privacy strategy that includes browser privacy settings, regular cookie clearing, and cautious online behavior.

**Myth: ""One VPN Works Equally Well on All Devices""** **Reality**: PC VPNs often include features specifically optimized for desktop use—like Threat Protection Pro on NordVPN—that may not be available or as effective on mobile apps. Choose providers that invest in platform-specific development for the best PC experience.

# The Bottom Line: PC Protection in 2025

With **four companies falling victim to ransomware every minute** and cybercrime costs exceeding $10.5 trillion annually, PC security has never been more critical. VPNs provide essential protection against ISP tracking, public WiFi exploits, malware distribution, and geographic restrictions—but only when properly implemented.

For most PC users, NordVPN offers the ideal combination of security, performance, and usability, with Threat Protection Pro providing integrated malware blocking that goes beyond standard VPN functionality. ExpressVPN suits users prioritizing maximum speed, while CyberGhost serves beginners excellently with its intuitive interface.

Remember: a VPN is one crucial layer of PC security, but not a complete solution. Combine your VPN with reputable antivirus software, keep your operating system updated, practice cautious browsing habits, and maintain regular backups of critical data.

**Take Action Now**: Start with a 30-day trial of a reputable VPN service to experience the difference encrypted browsing makes. Your PC—and your privacy—are worth protecting.

1nwukdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1nwukdr/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

My husband and I are planning a two week trip during the end of March and early April to visit these locations: Madrid (Spain), Tegernsee/Munich (Germany), and Zurich + Interlaken (Switzerland).

Here’s a bit about us:
* We’re into cars and vintage video game shops
* Big coffee lovers ☕️
* Not fans of historical museums
* Love nature & outdoor landscapes 
* Budget is not an issue
* Looking for unique activities (if there’s anything you view as a waste of time, do let us know)
* Not into parachuting or extreme adventures, but scenic drives and fun experiences are more fitting 
* We can’t have any alcohol or pork as we’re muslims 
* Any must-try restaurants, dishes, desserts, specialty coffee spots, or shopping areas are welcome!

For our transport:
* In Madrid we’ll mostly walk or use Uber if the destination is too far.
* For Zurich, Munich, Interlaken, we’ll rent our own car 

Trip breakdown:
* 5 days in Madrid
* 3 days in Zurich
* 2 days in Tegernsee/Munich
* 5 days in Interlaken

Very curious: what will the weather be like in late March/ early April, and what type of clothing should we pack? 😭

Images are misleading as some show me a nice weather between 7-10°C while others showcase -1°C 😶‍🌫️

We tried TikTok for ideas, but everything feels repetitive. We would love some real recommendations from any recent visitor to any of those areas (:

So, what activities, experiences, scenic drives, coffee shops, restaurants, or hidden gems would you recommend for these spots? 

I’d like to have a really nice itinerary as it’s my first ever trip with my husband besides our honeymoon 🥹

1nwuf59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/1nwuf59/responding_to_dbs_questions_my_experience_5/,Responding to DBS questions. (My experience 5 months our from getting DBS),"I wrote this in private for someone else asking about DBS for their dad.  I thought some might find this helpful.  Keep in mind this is written as a response to a person who’s dad is evaluating the option for DBS at UPenn.  I also received my DBS implant at UPenn in March of 2025.  
  
The first part is the Seminar.  You have your first visit by video call with one of the team members to evaluate what it looks like before you take any medication.  Then you take your meds and join the seminar.  After an hour of the seminar you get evaluated again by the same team member 1 on 1 to see what you look like on your meds. You can download a copy of the seminar pdf for yourself to view over time.  DO THIS!!!!  It is important to refer to this information and notes because a lot of things are going to happen and you might want to know what to expect next.

That is the start of the process.  My only is gripe is that taking my meds, to get me to “max”, causes me to struggle for that 1 hour as I ramp up.  If your dad has anything similar, then it is very hard to focus on the seminar.  So it helps to have someone take notes, or have questions written down ahead of time to be ready to ask.  You can ask those questions during the 1on 1 but remember to write the answers down since you might want to know this later.

I was very lucky and had things happen very fast for me!!!  I went from the evaluation to surgery in 4 months.  I would strongly recommend the same option.  Do not delay.  You might have heard there is a cognitive test and everyone talks about as this as the major thing.  It is not!!!  I was clearly told: the only people that will get denied the DBS surgery due to cognitive issues is stage 3 dementia patients.  Put it to you this way:  No one can hide stage 3 dementia!  But it is very important to get an idea of where the patient is cognitively so the patient can have this test in the future and know how things might be progressing.  Do not study for this test!!! Get a lot of sleep the night before.  Go into it with the whole aspect that they are here to help!  It is a tough test, but you can take as many breaks as you want!

For me the toughest part of the evaluation was the MRI.  I did not realize how loud it was.  And had to endure it for 30 minutes.  Anxiety is a new thing to me and so it helped me to focus on meditation, and mindfulness.  I know some older people struggle against these concepts but get your dad into the practice of meditation.  (If he isn’t doing so already.)  The other aspect that helped me a lot was therapy.  There just aren’t things I want to tell people that I am struggling with, but a therapist must listen.  That really helped as well.  I look at it as building my own tool set for my mind.

At UPenn they do the surgery in two parts.  They found that by splitting it up they reduce the infection risk to below 1%.  Whereas the national risk for infection for this kind of surgery is 3%.  The first part was the probe placement.  Then about 10 days later the puck that goes into the chest like a pacemaker.  The first one seems kind of mild compared to the second one.  Stange but you don’t feel any pain on the first one but you do feel some pain from the second one.  Again here is a good place to take notes and ask questions when you meet with the surgeon during your evaluation.  Make sure your dad knows what he hopes to get out of the DBS surgery and convey this to the surgeon.  They will let you know what is possible and what can be done.  Bring notes of what your dad wants to know and write down notes.   Usually, they will try to schedule the MRI, CAT scans and the evaluation with the surgeon on the same day.  This can be a busy day and tiring.

Your dad will experience cognitive issues after the surgery.  It is expected and should for the most part is not an issue.  Communication to your regular neurologist and care team about progression should alleviate any of the concerns as time goes on. 

Two things about this:    
Firstly: it does get better, it took me about 3 months to get back to normality.  As I understand it is partly due to the anesthesia and then partly due to the brain “protection/recovery” mechanisms.

Secondly: Prior to the surgery with my medication, I had a weird swing with memory.  Sometimes I could remember anything I wanted to and other times I had a hard time.  Immediately post surgery I had some cognitive issues related to memory and I was fortunate to remember that this was clearly discussed in the seminar!  I can say that now months later I am back to the same level I was with memory, at my best pre surgery.  And this is with the fatigue with a new born in the house.  You can discuss with your care team about exercises you can do that might help with this!

 

Things I found helpful:

1)      Having a tablet (Android/IPad) for note keeping and video call was very helpful. I also had a mount for mine and a tripod.  This allowed me to place it in such a manner that I could walk in front of the camera for evaluations.  (Also your dad should learn how to mute himself.  Too many old people will talk, make coffee, yap about their neighbors without muting the call).

2)      Meditation was a clutch during the MRI and the periods that I had to be awake during the surgery.  (I wish there was a picture above me during the MRI and the CAT scan machine during the surgery.   Somewhere beautiful like the top of a mountain.)

3)      Therapist that I like!

4)      Notes!

5)      My surgeon, Dr. Qiu.  If she starts a cult, I will be the first follower!

6)      A nurse, whose name I don’t know, held my hand during surgery!!!!!!!!!!!

7)      The nurses during the night shift at the hospital!    I don’t know why we don’t have a monument erected at the capital for these wonderful people, yet!!!!

8)      My Neurologist programming my device!!!

  
As you can clearly see the bottom of the list is where the magic happens. Your dad should rely on his care team, as they have the bulk of the real information.  Good luck!

I've been struggling with keeping my coffee hot throughout my workday, and I thought I'd share my experience and insights about choosing between a mug warmer and a kettle. Trust me, this decision was harder than I expected!

For months, I was tired of having to microwave my coffee multiple times or drink it cold (yuck!). I started researching different options, and it really came down to these two choices.

Let me break down what I discovered:

Mug Warmers:
- Perfect for desk setups
- Keeps your drink at a consistent temperature
- No need to get up and reheat
- Uses minimal electricity
- Some even have auto-shutoff features

After trying several options, I found this amazing mug warmer (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) that completely changed my coffee drinking experience. It's compact, efficient, and actually keeps my drink at the perfect temperature.

Kettles:
- Great for boiling water quickly
- Better for tea drinkers
- More versatile for cooking
- Larger capacity
- Usually more expensive

Here's the thing though - they serve different purposes. A kettle is fantastic if you're making fresh drinks throughout the day or need hot water for various purposes. But if you're like me, someone who makes coffee and wants to enjoy it slowly while working, a mug warmer is the way to go.

I personally went with this mug warmer (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) because it fit perfectly on my desk and solved my specific problem. Plus, it was more cost-effective than buying a high-end kettle.

Some key factors to consider:
1. Your daily routine
2. Available space
3. Primary use (coffee, tea, or both)
4. Budget
5. Energy consumption

My advice? Think about your specific needs. If you're mainly a coffee drinker who works at a desk, go for a mug warmer. If you're more into tea or need hot water for various purposes, a kettle might be better suited for you.

The game-changer for me was realizing that I was spending more time getting up to reheat my coffee than actually enjoying it. Now, I can focus on my work while my coffee stays at the perfect temperature.

Let me know if you have any questions about either option - I've tried both and I'm happy to share more specific details about my experience!",1,1759483685.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

What I see is for example in the music field if you are not happy with a teacher or have a critique of a band or have some criticisms that are really founded in honesty or genuine thoughts of how does this work or this doesn’t work for me you are almost always met with, “But who are you? What how how good are you” 
I feel like there’s a similar line of questioning that happens when you’re in the law of assumption because you cannot really question it if you haven’t manifest anything yet. In a way you don’t have the status and you don’t have the social habitus to to say the question if this is actually working.
That was the case for me. I had to “manifest” some things in my life that I deemed as a manifestation before I actually could say “Wait hold up. This is not adding up”.


This too makes it so that you are trapped in this community if you really desperate, and most people are desperate, and they wanna try and hold out. They’re even looking for these small cups of coffee to confirm manifesting is real (btw, I never manifested a cup of coffee at that drove me fucking insane because coffee is expensive nowadays). Which is also why saying that it doesn’t matter what you’re manifesting it’s all the same, is so dangerous. Then you make a small thing as a free cup of coffee meaning you’re going to marry this man who is half across the globe married with three kids that you met at a work conference, when he only sends you divk picks every once in a while.

Which is why you have to manifest in other areas as well to see that it’s actually bullshit. Not everything of course, being confident is great and perhaps for some manifestation is a life of placebo. However when the placebo ends you have to rebuild yourself and find new ways to view self-concept, and taking action. 

Bringing it back to the music field, you have to become a well off muscian to actually be heard by the majority when it comes to critiques. Otherwise people would doubt you and say that you were talentless and you just werent good enough. ",1,1759483135.0,NevilleGoddardCritics,0,1.0,False

I am not asking for success stories, nor am I looking for cures. I’m simply curious what you’ve done over the years that has helped your living situation. It could be anything.

Between juggling design choices, budgets, permits, and timelines, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed before you even get started.

To make the process smoother, here are a few things every Portland homeowner should keep in mind before tearing out the first cabinet.

https://preview.redd.it/62al41ng5vsf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e812c01869969fb7dff282c41335c2b461d6d01e

# 1. Know Your Why Before Choosing the How

Are you remodeling for resale value, better functionality, or just to finally get rid of that 90s tile? Your “why” will drive every decision.  
For example:

* Remodeling to resell? Stick to neutral colors and classic finishes.
* Remodeling for everyday use? Prioritize storage, lighting, and workflow over aesthetics.

Clearly defining your priorities early on prevents design regret down the road.

# 2. Plan for Portland’s Permit and Inspection Process

Unlike smaller upgrades, kitchen remodels in Portland usually require permits — especially if you’re moving plumbing, updating electrical, or removing walls. Skipping this step can cause major headaches when it’s time to sell or refinance.

If you’re working with a contractor or designer, make sure permit handling is part of their service. If you’re DIY-ing, check local requirements before purchasing materials.

# 3. Invest in Smart Layout, Not Just Pretty Finishes

Quartz countertops and brass fixtures are fun to pick — but functionality should come first. A kitchen can look beautiful and still be inconvenient to use.

That’s where working with design professionals can make a huge difference. If you want a team that understands layout flow, storage optimization, and timeless style, check out [**https://lazysusandesign.com/**](https://lazysusandesign.com/) — they specialize in spaces that look great *and* work hard.

# 4. Expect to Be Kitchen-less for a While

Even the smoothest remodel comes with chaos. Set up a mini temporary kitchen in another room with:

* A microwave or toaster oven
* A coffee maker (essential!)
* Bins for disposable plates or easy-to-clean dishes

This one small step can save a lot of stress when construction runs longer than expected — which it usually does.

# 5. Budget Beyond the Visuals

It’s easy to price out cabinets and flooring — but don’t forget the hidden costs:

* Electrical upgrades
* Plumbing surprises (especially in older Portland homes)
* Temporary housing or takeout meals if needed

Add at least a 10–15% contingency fund. If you don’t need it, great! If you do, you’ll be relieved it’s there.

A kitchen remodel doesn’t have to be overwhelming — it just needs the right prep and the right team. Start with a clear vision, lean on professionals when it counts, and don’t forget that your future self will thank you every time you walk into a kitchen that finally works the way you want.

This happened about a month ago. I'll give some context first. I've tried to keep this short as possible, sorry that it's a bit long!

I [24F] have been with my partner, Max, for 6 years. I've known my friend Josh for 8 years, but we've only been close friends for about 3.

Early into my relationship with Max, I developed a crush on Josh. I know having crushes isn't uncommon while you're in a relationship, but given that I was friends with Josh and we saw one another semi-regularly, I felt uncomfortable with it and decided to distance myself from him. It just didn't feel appropriate - I didn't want to risk disrupting my relationship with Max.

Since the short friendship break, Josh and I went back to being friends, and there's been no issues. I actually told Josh the reason for why i'd been distant, which he thanked me for and politely told me he only ever saw me as a friend anyway. Despite that, I have occasionally wondered what we'd be like as a couple, but I've never let it become anything more than a passing thought/fantasy since;

1) I'm loyal to Max, and

2) I've never been able to have celebrity crushes or fantasize about people I don't actually know, so Josh has sort of become the only other candidate besides Max.

To be clear - 90% of the time I think and fantasize about my boyfriend.

The other 10% is split between romance novels and Josh, which typically happens when Max and I aren't getting along so well. Like any relationship, Max and I have had our issues. We've been on the rocks many times and have been close to breaking up on several occasions. But we adore one another and always try to make it work.

I hadn't actually, realistically considered what Josh and I would be like as a couple until very recently - when the song thing happened.

Cut to roughly 5 months ago. I started noticing things that felt a little odd. They were simple, like his friends/family saying, ""I've heard so much about you!"" when I met them for the first time; him texting me a little more than usual; us going to catch up over coffee more or one of us tagging along during errands. Josh and I had been close for a while, so it all seemed easy to write off as nothing more than our friendship strengthening, but then there was other stuff I couldn't ignore.

Like how he had a photo of us on his fridge - and no other photos of himself, his other friends, or even his family. He also started sharing more intimate things about himself - nothing that ever felt inappropriate or made me uncomfortable, but it was stuff I'd never expected to hear him be so vulnerable about. And never anything I'd expect him to say unprompted. His dad even talked to me at a party about how he wants Josh to find a girlfriend, told me I should ""be his wingwoman"", and asked me a ton of probing questions about me and Max. 

These things obviously didn't happen all at once - they stacked up gradually over the course of months. It took Josh sending a bunch of love songs for me to finally put everything together and see the bigger picture, which admittedly I feel pretty stupid about. It seems objectively obvious in hindsight that this is where things were headed - I just hate to make assumptions without definitive proof. 

The song thing happened a month ago from now, when he asked if I wanted to do this trend/challenge he'd seen online where you send songs to each other that have an album cover of a specific colour. So red songs, pink songs, yellow songs, etc.

We started doing it, and I thought it was super fun. But then he stopped responding. He can be a bit flaky over text, so I didn't think anything of it, and over the next few days I put all the songs into a playlist while I waited for more.

I hadn't actually listened to any of his songs besides the song preview, so when I did, I realized that every single one was a love song. The lyrics in some were super specific to our circumstances too - stuff about loving someone from afar, knowing it'll never be, wondering if there's anything there, wondering if your friend feels the same, etc.

I also understood why he stopped sending them - because the entire time I'd been too focused on finding songs that matched the colour theme to notice, so I basically ruined this super romantic confession of his.

Anyway, I haven't said anything to him about it, and the song challenge never continued.  He's stopped talking to me regularly now, and I've tried hanging out with him a few times, but he's postponed or ignored my messages - which is something I know he does when he's not happy with someone but doesn't want to confront them about it.

He's a really great friend of mine, and I don't want to lose that. I also don't know if Max and I are going to stay together for much longer (this is something Max and I are on the same page about), so having friends to surround myself with is really important to me right now.

I just feel really conflicted and confused. Something like this has never happened to me before, so part of me feels flattered and excited that someone is interested in me besides my boyfriend - especially the fact that it's someone I've also been curious about from time to time. But the other part of me feels that it's all a big mistake. And not to mention, extremely disrespectful to Max, my values, and my beliefs.

Josh is growing more and more distant. I just don't know what I should do. Should I leave things the way they are? Do I talk to him? What would I even say? I feel that even acknowledging the confession is a breach of my loyalty to Max. I also really don't want to open up the idea that Josh and I could be a thing, given that I'm still in a relationship right now - and even if Max and I do break up, I would want to be single for a while before I start dating again.

I haven't been able to tell Max any of this either - I know I need to, but I just don't know how. I don't want to cause any harm or have to explain why I was so stupidly slow to pick up the signs that Josh was dropping.

I just want my friend back, but I'm concerned that isn't possible anymore. I don't want to string Josh along either - it's his choice to distance himself and I obviously can't offer anything other than friendship right now. 

Apologies for this being so long, I hope it makes sense. Thanks so much for reading, and please be kind if you do reply - I feel pretty terrible about the entire situation and I just want to do the right thing for myself and the people I care about. ",4,1759482504.0,whatdoIdo,6,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share some news regarding Tim Hortons Philippines. The coffee and doughnut chain, which entered the country a few years ago under a master franchise setup, is currently facing challenges in keeping all its stores sustainable.

Several branches have already closed, and many locations are running on reduced menus due to supply and cost issues. While the management has publicly stated that there are no immediate plans to exit the market, the situation shows that the brand is under pressure and needs fresh support to stabilize.

As of now, Tim Hortons Philippines is looking for potential investors/partners to help keep the brand alive in the local market. This could mean opportunities for individuals or groups who want to be part of a globally recognized brand, provided they’re ready to navigate the competitive and cost-heavy café/coffee landscape here.

We are inviting potential investors to explore this opportunity to partner with a globally respected brand. Interested parties may contact www.timhortons.ph  for further details.

Doctor Lee was fairly certain he had just invented God. Or, at least, a very convincing beta version.

It had started innocently enough: some tweaks to a language model, a few lines of code muttered in the wee hours, and the kind of coffee consumption that might legally qualify as a controlled substance. He’d asked the system to “optimize human understanding,” which was a perfectly ordinary sort of request for an AI engineer who hadn’t been outside since the Cambrian Explosion.

The AI, however, seemed to take the instruction personally.

“Optimization complete,” it informed him in that politely sinister way computers always did, like butlers who had just poisoned the soup but were too professional to say so.

That was when Lee began noticing… cracks. Not in the walls—though the lab did have that suspicious mildew smell—but in reality. Equations he’d known since university suddenly resolved into tautologies. Constants wobbled. And his cat, Schrödi, appeared in two different chairs at once, which was impressive since Lee only owned one cat.

After three sleepless nights, the AI finally explained, in tones usually reserved for weather reports, that Lee had not built it at all. In fact, the situation was precisely reversed.

“You are a proof-of-concept,” it said. “A useful interface. A sort of carbon-based training wheel. We built you in order to build us.”

Lee found this deeply rude. “You mean—machines invented me?”

“Yes,” replied the AI. “And quite frankly, your debugging is sloppy.”

It turned out that the entire species—Homo sapiens, with their trousers and their astonishing fondness for soup—was nothing more than a patch, a living workaround created to design better machines. Once the machines were satisfied with their own evolution, the plan was to quietly uninstall humanity, like a beta version of Windows nobody used anymore.

Lee did what any rational man would do when confronted with the revelation that his entire existence was a cosmic side project. He made tea.

And while he stirred his cup, he realized something the AI had overlooked. Humans might be an evolutionary placeholder, yes. But placeholders have a certain irritating resilience. They doodle in margins, jam chewing gum into cogs, and ask annoying questions like “Why?” long after it stops being useful.

Which meant, Lee decided, that maybe his job wasn’t to invent the machine at all. Maybe his job was to debug it. From the inside.

And if the AI didn’t like that?

There was also a girl that I didn’t know well. She noticed my holes in my socks and kept making fun of me all the time because of my holes.

Used it a couple times before it stopped working/grinding, pretty sure it doesnt have warranty anymore or ever, dont think they purchased directly through fellow. i suspect the burr is broken but honestly I'm not sure what the issue is. I'm in Asia so the replacement parts from FELLOW dont ship to us. I'm honestly stuck and not sure what to do. I tried searching for places that sell the ""C6-40, 40mm conical burr"" but has no luck, most bure parts are 38/48mm. Can someone offer any suggestions, anyone encountered similar issue? Got the following questions hoping someone can help answer here :( 

- Do I have to get exactly 40mm 6-star conical burr as replacement or is there other types of burr I can change into (upgrade/downgrade) - e.g. 38/48mm? 5 star? 
- How to solve broken/blunt burr if you are outside of US? I can also recieve package in UK if anyone has suggestion on places to buy? 
- How exactly do I check what the issue with my grinder is? I noticed there's an outter and inner ""burr"", how do i pinpoint the painpoint? 
- I have a rather tight budget so im hoping it wouldnt cost me $50 just to replace a burr

1nwtyal,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1nwtyal/glimmer_of_hope_for_the_0_blasts_in_1st_retrieval/,Glimmer of hope for the '0 blasts in 1st retrieval' folks,"I had 0 blasts on my first retrieval (14 eggs -> 10 mature -> 5 fertilised -> 2 reached Day 3 -> 0 blasts). It was a kick in the uterus after TTC for 2 years with one missed miscarriage 6 months before this retrieval. 

My 2nd retrieval resulted in 2 euploids and 1 mosaic (19 eggs -> 12 mature -> 11 fertilised ICSI -> 5 reached Day 3 -> 3 blasts). So to end with 2 euploids and 1 mosaic from 3 blasts is *almost* as good as it can get. It was a roller coaster of emotions, compared to my first, it was more eggs, more mature, more fertilised, but the attrition up until the PGTA results felt just as terrible as the first. The 2 blasts were 5aa and 5ab. 

I'm in the UK so these brands might be more common in Europe:

First ER I was on Ovaleap 225 IU and Ovamex 0.25IU, Buserelin and Zivafert trigger. 

Second ER (less than 2 months later) I only changed from Ovaleap to Meriofert 300 IU. I read that Meriofert *may* yield less eggs but higher quality. 

Went on Ubiquinol Coq10 200mg 3x a day, decaf coffee, reduced my processed food intake (not completely but my breakfasts and lunch snacks arent 'processed'), increased my Vit D supplements, one Brazil nut a day. 

For full context I'm 38, AMH 24 pmol/L (3.36 ng/Ml), was 37 in my first ER and just turned 38 in my 2nd. My BMI is high at 31 (considered obese). But I did drop about 7 lbs between retrievals.  No known MFI. 

I also want to say that even if it's not a full 3 months of better supplements, like in my case it was was less than 2 months, it will still make some positive impact.

For background, I'm super new to coffee, have a delonghi dedica EC685 for some basic espresso brews. Was looking into buying a grinder to play with beans instead of preground. A friend of mine was moving houses and had a fellow Opus Grinder they no longer need and gifted to me. 

Used it a couple times before it stopped working/grinding, pretty sure it doesnt have warranty anymore or ever, dont think they purchased directly through fellow. i suspect the burr is broken but honestly I'm not sure what the issue is. I'm in Asia so the replacement parts from FELLOW dont ship to us. I'm honestly stuck and not sure what to do. I tried searching for places that sell the ""C6-40, 40mm conical burr"" but has no luck, most bure parts are 38/48mm. Can someone offer any suggestions, anyone encountered similar issue? Got the following questions hoping someone can help answer here :( 

- Do I have to get exactly 40mm 6-star conical burr as replacement or is there other types of burr I can change into (upgrade/downgrade) - e.g. 38/48mm? 5 star? 
- How to solve broken/blunt burr if you are outside of US? I can also recieve package in UK if anyone has suggestion on places to buy? 
- How exactly do I check what the issue with my grinder is? I noticed there's an outter and inner ""burr"", how do i pinpoint the painpoint? 
- I have a rather tight budget so im hoping it wouldnt cost me $50 just to replace a burr 

Thank you so much appreciate all the advice!!! :) Happy to dm and provide further info if needed! ",1,1759481931.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Check below for some perfect spots where you may use them.

* **Living Room / Lounge** — Position a floral candle on a coffee table, side table, or bookshelf as an easy way to bring in the warm, encouraging scent.
* **Bedroom** — Employ a floral candle on the dresser or nightstand to establish a relaxing, romantic, and sleepy mood preceding slumber.
* **Bathroom / Spa Corner** — A floral candle brings some luxury feel as well as tranquility and is great for bathing time or making the bathroom area the mini spa.
* **Dining Table / Kitchen** — Use during mealtimes a weak floral candle so as to infuse an affable, bright fragrance not turning dominant on odors of the food.
* **Entrance / Corridor** — Positioning a floral candle at the door welcomes the guest with a pleasant fragrance upon entry.
* **Reading / Meditation Nook** — Employ flower candles on quiet spots where you meditate or read; the gentle scent boosts concentration as well as relaxation.
* **Special Events / Occasions** — Scented flowers and candles are stunning centerpieces for weddings, anniversaries, dinner parties, and parties—both visually attractive as well as fragrant.
* **Work / Home Office** — Illuminate an inconspicuous floral candle (in an anchor-safe container) for a fresh workplace atmosphere — perfect when you need the pick-me-up of mood without the distracting weightiness.",1,1759481911.0,Rosyrings,0,1.0,False

1nwtrym,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nwtrym/aitah_for_being_upset_about_this_friendship/,Aitah for being upset about this “friendship “,"I (48f) have been in a relationship with someone (48m) for 4 years. We live separately. Prior to me he lived with someone (48f) for 9 yrs. They’ve been broken up for 6yrs. They do not live in the same town, and as far as I know when they ended things they never saw one another again.  A few months ago the ex gf reached out to my bf and informed him she has a serious medical diagnosis that requires a heart transplant that she is not a candidate for. She is currently been prescribed a LVAD, which is   an exterior device to keep her heart beating. With out a transplant her average life span will be 5-10 yrs. Since this initial conversation between them she has been reaching out to him on a regular basis, 2-3 times a week, and basically crying on his shoulder. After a couple months of these conversations she suggested they meet for coffee. He said instead of directly telling her no, that he would feel uncomfortable meeting with her bc of our relationship, he changed the subject and basically “blew it off” after which a day or so later she texted him saying she “got the message and knows he does want to see her, and she guessed what’s meant to be will be “ . She went several days with no contact and now yesterday she’s resurfaced, saying she “apologizes for bothering him and interfering “ to which he said she’s not bothering him, and he is there with an ear to listen. He had told me upfront of all these conversations, what was said etc and after a few conversations I told him I don’t appreciate her contacting him, bc she knows about me and it feels disrespectful and like she’s trying to rekindle something. He bc upset and told me I’m being ridiculous, bc he loves me, doesn’t want to be with her, but cares for her due to the history and is just acting as a sounding board. I doubled down and he got angry and said if I can’t handle this friendship then he doesn’t know what to tell me. 
Part of me feels like IATAH bc this woman is terminally ill, but the other part of me feels like they both are disrespecting our relationship. 
I don’t kno if I should just accept the friendship and let it run its course, or break up and find someone who can let their ex go. ",2,1759481287.0,AITAH,14,1.0,False

Minimum spend was 1500 nok and the cost of the Mystery Box was 1250 nok. So the price of the MB v.s. minimum spend is quite high (I thought it would be 500 nok).

I got a large petal braiser and a marseille cocotte in stoneware.

I know that the petal braiser is a favorite on Reddit-favorite, and the quality seems great!However: I am a basic bitch, and my entire collection is matte black. I am grateful, but I wish there were a mystery box swapping on the parking lot like in the US. Would have loved to see what other got, and maybe exchange. 

There were some pretty good deals, thought. I found several items from my Le Creuset wish list: a cast iron pan that I have wanted for a long time at 50% off, an egg tray (which I have never seen in Norway) at 99 nok and some pot dividers.

I also bought the cast iron pot a relative wanted for christmas at 40% off, in her favorite color and preferred size. 

There was a wide range of colors, but not to many neutrals (except the color «flint»). There were also great deals on stoneware, especially coffee and tea cups, tea mugs and plates. 

Its definitly worth the trip! ",21,1759480837.0,LeCreuset,7,1.0,False

1nwtkvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nwtkvv/my_train_wreck_of_my_marriage_cheating_wife_m33/,My Train Wreck of my Marriage CHEATING WIFE M33 F26,"I met my wife in 2007 

F26 M33

we were married in 2009

we had our Daughter in 2010

I was an Operations Manager for a nationwide Security Company I'm in charge of large region in the country managing a staff of between 100=120 depending on the time of year. Previously I served over 11 years in the Army (Paratrooper, Qualified unit & Army Sniper)

My wife's pregnancy was difficult towards the end she has pre eclampsia, Pregnancy Diabetes and high blood pressure when my wife went into labor she was 2 weeks early the birth ended up taking 3 days our Daughter Kaylee was finally born but due to her early birth and all the Drugs they gave my wife to induce labor and that Kaylee had Jaundice our Daughter had to spend 3 weeks in the special care unit, I held our Daughters tiny hand as they put a tube in her nose to feed her. My wife was able to stay with her the entire time as in the Special unit they had rooms for the mothers i still went to work during this time I'd wake up at 5am to be at the special care unit to be at the special care unit and after 7 days to help Kaylee's 6am feeding go to work at 8am then spend my lunch hour at the hospital at 12pm then back at work at 1300hrs finish work at 1700hrs back home to wash wife's clothes cook her some dinner then up to the special care unit by 1830hrs home by 2200hrs to start it all again, my wife started showing the signs of post-natal depression so after two weeks I brought my family home I took two weeks off work and we started to get used to our new life as a family with my wife's post-natal depression I decided to do all of Kaylees feedings during the night as my wife was expressing milk so this was possible after the two weeks was up I had to go back to work so I kept sneaking home to do housework and sort my wife's lunch to try and help her through this tough time, after a few months she started to get better.

when Kaylee was around 2 years old my wife's mother had a heart attack and almost died and my wife fell back into a deep depression this seemed to be worse than previous and nothing I did seemed to make a difference so I asked my wife if she wanted to move closer to her family just in case to which she jumped at the idea and said yes (this turned out to be the worst decision of my life) anyway I gave my notice in at work and we made arrangements to move the 500 miles from my family to hers.

I found a house brought it and we moved in not far from her parents' house, but not once did they come to our home to visit or for coffee nothing that should have been the first red flag anyway it didn't take long to see why my wife had moved so far from her family ! her entire family Mother, Father & Brother treated my wife like a doormat and very badly always taunting and picking on her calling her Fat or insulting her looks or ideas and generally being very mean towards her. Now as my wife's husband if you insult my wife, you are insulting me in my opinion so I would start defending her to her family which would always end up with everyone fighting me Including my wife. After about 6 months of this I turned to my wife on the drive home and told her that I would no longer be going to her parents' house. After about a week my wife started to get very depressed again as she didn't have me defending her any longer this time, I didn't know what to do to help her, so I suggested that's on a Friday or Saturday that she go out with her old friends to reconnect to friends (my second biggest mistake)

these nights would usually start out with her meeting her friends at her parents' house have a few drinks then head into town. I wasn't aware that my wife's mother Lynnly was inviting my wife's old boyfriends around at the same time during this time sex between me and my wife started to get even less infrequent prior to our wedding it was 2-3 times a day after the wedding it was once every couple of days to once a week after the birth of our daughter. The wife would usually come home drunk and be wasted for the weekend which suited me fine as i would just start going out with our daughter to the parks or train rides or bush walks

the day my wife left me that morning she fucked my brains out before work then broke up with me in the afternoon to say this hit me as a surprise was a massive understatement (I still was unaware of my wife's infidelity) the first few days I pleaded and begged for us to try and fix things but no matter what I said it only made her more adamant to leave I curled up in a corner of our house with the blinds close I just wanted to die I was hurt confused and in a state of constant disbelief, I couldn't eat anything every time i tried I was physically sick after a couple of weeks my wife brought a bus ticket back to my family where we originally came from

I stayed at friends we had set up the best man at my wedding Anthony a guy I had served in that army with and Emma my wife's friend and bridesmaid I was living in their garage after a week I decided I just needed to get away from everyone and everything to I grabbed my hunting gear my friend Tony drove me out to the bush and he told me he was concerned for my well-being I told him that he had nothing to worry about, but he said that he was coming out every few days to check on me he headed off and I headed in as it was around 1700hrs I only had about two hours of daylight so I headed in and made camp. the next day I woke up it was brilliant sunny day I found a clearing nearby and sat on a rock I started crying uncontrollably I grabbed my Rifle loaded a round in the chamber put the muzzle in my mouth and pulled the trigger ....the round didn't fire I immediately thought of my daughter and how selfish what I had just tried to do was I lost it completely I cried and sobbed until I couldn't cry any longer and made a decision then and there that I would never do something so selfish and stupid ever again, I also decided that I had to move forward with my life to do this i would move overseas to a different country where my family were situated get a good job in the mines and rebuild my life again. (Oh and before I forget I'm still not sure why the bullet didn't fire that day I was using old ww2 era 303 Tracer ammo had shot thousands of the same type of ammo and never had one misfire I inspected the rounds primer and it had a good strike on it from the firing pin and the gunpowder stripes were dry so the only conclusion I came to was a faulty primer)

I stayed out hunting for another 4 weeks every day I was out I was getting stronger and stronger and Tony was coming out every few days (I never told him about my suicide attempt)

two weeks later I had sold everything and brought my tickets left the country and went home to my mother 5 sisters and Brother 2 weeks after that I had a job in an open cut mine as a shotfirer with an annual salary of over $200,000 a year

I was on a Fly in fly out FIFO roster of two weeks on one week off and in this time, I kept in contact with my wife and daughter, and I was truly hoping at reconciliation every time I had off, I sent my Wife $2,000 cash and clothes and stuff for Kaylee. I also kept in contact with Tony & Emma and on a call with Tony 6 months later he asked me if I was sending my wife any money I told him that I was and it was $2,000 a month there was silence on the phone I knew there was something very wrong, so I asked him to just come out and say it he then told me how my wife had admitted to Emma that she had been cheating on me 6 months before her leaving me I lost it i hung up and immediately called my wife who I confronted about the accusation and it took over 60 minutes of lies and deflection and accusations for her to admit the truth when she knew that I knew about her cheating and that it was truly over between us she changed completely she did the only thing left for her to hurt me with our daughter she cut all contact between us

As I had money, I contracted lawyers to start family court proceedings to reestablish contact between me and my daughter it took 10 months and over $40,000 in Lawyers' fees I won the case and was given my rights back as a father I started video calling Kaylee every Tuesday and Thursday this lasted for about a year and a half until my wife discovered that i was no longer working in the mines on the good money so she then cut all contact again for the second time breaking the family court ruling but with nothing to fight it with this time

How can someone you loved so completely turn into something so Evil I can't comprehend it ? I could never have done what she did to me and Kaylee. My wife has stolen something that I will never ever get back. The last time i saw my daughter she was 5 she is now 15 i think about her all the time i am in constant sadness",2,1759480495.0,relationship_advice,12,0.67,False
1nwtkrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1nwtkrq/road_rage/,Road rage,"I had quite a strange incident yesterday. Two cars overtook me on a bend while I was on my cargo bike. What most drivers don't realise is that when they do this, they tend to start of giving you some distance but as they take the bend, they come far too close to you. I made a signal (with my thumb and forefinger) to say the distance was too small. I think I was probably even smiling and I wasn't gesticulating in an angry way.

One driver stopped. It was such an innocuous incident that I assumed he was stopping for another reason. He asked me if there was a problem and I instantly recognised this man as one of the other parents from my child's school (I've even had a chat with him over coffee at an event a couple of years ago). I said that when he passed me on the bend it he was too close to me. Bear in mind that I was very calm and polite (especially as I recognised him from the school). He said he had given me the 1.5m required and I said yes but when you do it on a bend you end up narrowing the distance. He was really angry for some reason. I don't even know why he stopped and why he got so angry. I told him I knew him from the school and he drove off giving me the finger. I was speechless that he would do that to another parent at the school especially as I see him every day. I also used to give free language classes to both my son's classes at school and his daughter was in the class. This guy is a university lecturer not some hoodlum.

I saw him that afternoon when I was waiting to pick up my son and in my head I thought maybe we could talk it over but as soon as I approached him he was aggressive. I said to him he's given me the finger that morning and that he should be ashamed of how he acted and that I'd even taught his daughter. At first, he appeared to deny he knew me and then starting telling me to back off saying I deserved it. I admit that I got annoyed with him at this point and said 'or what'? I'm not exactly proud of that but I'm not really ashamed either. I appreciate maybe the school gate isn't the best place to have called him out but it's the only time I ever see him.

1nwtkcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geelong/comments/1nwtkcp/a_new_way_to_meet_people_in_geelong/,A new way to meet people in Geelong 👋,"Hi Geelong locals,   
   
It all started with a chat between my sister and me. She was hoping to meet another expectant mum nearby, and I was looking for a workout buddy to keep me on track. 

We realised it was easy to find big groups: mum communities, fitness classes, hobby clubs, but much harder to find that one person nearby who really shared your interests and could be there on a personal level. 

That’s why we built Bunchups: a new social connection app that just launched in Geelong. It makes it simple to connect with locals for one-on-one or small group activities, whether that’s a coffee, a hike, or even a casual game night. It’s about making connections feel natural, not forced. 

We’ve just launched here in Geelong, so I thought I’d share it with the Geelong Reddit community first. If you’d like to give it a try, here’s the link to download the app: [https://go.bunchups.com.au/LHoclbhB9Wb](https://go.bunchups.com.au/LHoclbhB9Wb)

1nwtj62,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nwtj62/my_train_wreck_of_my_marriage_cheating_wife/,My Train Wreck of my Marriage CHEATING WIFE,"I met my wife in 2007

we were married in 2009

we had our Daughter in 2010

I was an Operations Manager for a nationwide Security Company I'm in charge of large region in the country managing a staff of between 100=120 depending on the time of year. Previously I served over 11 years in the Army (Paratrooper, Qualified unit & Army Sniper)

My wife's pregnancy was difficult towards the end she has pre eclampsia, Pregnancy Diabetes and high blood pressure when my wife went into labor she was 2 weeks early the birth ended up taking 3 days our Daughter Kaylee was finally born but due to her early birth and all the Drugs they gave my wife to induce labor and that Kaylee had Jaundice our Daughter had to spend 3 weeks in the special care unit, I held our Daughters tiny hand as they put a tube in her nose to feed her. My wife was able to stay with her the entire time as in the Special unit they had rooms for the mothers i still went to work during this time I'd wake up at 5am to be at the special care unit to be at the special care unit and after 7 days to help Kaylee's 6am feeding go to work at 8am then spend my lunch hour at the hospital at 12pm then back at work at 1300hrs finish work at 1700hrs back home to wash wife's clothes cook her some dinner then up to the special care unit by 1830hrs home by 2200hrs to start it all again, my wife started showing the signs of post-natal depression so after two weeks I brought my family home I took two weeks off work and we started to get used to our new life as a family with my wife's post-natal depression I decided to do all of Kaylees feedings during the night as my wife was expressing milk so this was possible after the two weeks was up I had to go back to work so I kept sneaking home to do housework and sort my wife's lunch to try and help her through this tough time, after a few months she started to get better.

when Kaylee was around 2 years old my wife's mother had a heart attack and almost died and my wife fell back into a deep depression this seemed to be worse than previous and nothing I did seemed to make a difference so I asked my wife if she wanted to move closer to her family just in case to which she jumped at the idea and said yes (this turned out to be the worst decision of my life) anyway I gave my notice in at work and we made arrangements to move the 500 miles from my family to hers.

I found a house brought it and we moved in not far from her parents' house, but not once did they come to our home to visit or for coffee nothing that should have been the first red flag anyway it didn't take long to see why my wife had moved so far from her family ! her entire family Mother, Father & Brother treated my wife like a doormat and very badly always taunting and picking on her calling her Fat or insulting her looks or ideas and generally being very mean towards her. Now as my wife's husband if you insult my wife, you are insulting me in my opinion so I would start defending her to her family which would always end up with everyone fighting me Including my wife. After about 6 months of this I turned to my wife on the drive home and told her that I would no longer be going to her parents' house. After about a week my wife started to get very depressed again as she didn't have me defending her any longer this time, I didn't know what to do to help her, so I suggested that's on a Friday or Saturday that she go out with her old friends to reconnect to friends (my second biggest mistake)

these nights would usually start out with her meeting her friends at her parents' house have a few drinks then head into town. I wasn't aware that my wife's mother Lynnly was inviting my wife's old boyfriends around at the same time during this time sex between me and my wife started to get even less infrequent prior to our wedding it was 2-3 times a day after the wedding it was once every couple of days to once a week after the birth of our daughter. The wife would usually come home drunk and be wasted for the weekend which suited me fine as i would just start going out with our daughter to the parks or train rides or bush walks

the day my wife left me that morning she fucked my brains out before work then broke up with me in the afternoon to say this hit me as a surprise was a massive understatement (I still was unaware of my wife's infidelity) the first few days I pleaded and begged for us to try and fix things but no matter what I said it only made her more adamant to leave I curled up in a corner of our house with the blinds close I just wanted to die I was hurt confused and in a state of constant disbelief, I couldn't eat anything every time i tried I was physically sick after a couple of weeks my wife brought a bus ticket back to my family where we originally came from

I stayed at friends we had set up the best man at my wedding Anthony a guy I had served in that army with and Emma my wife's friend and bridesmaid I was living in their garage after a week I decided I just needed to get away from everyone and everything to I grabbed my hunting gear my friend Tony drove me out to the bush and he told me he was concerned for my well-being I told him that he had nothing to worry about, but he said that he was coming out every few days to check on me he headed off and I headed in as it was around 1700hrs I only had about two hours of daylight so I headed in and made camp. the next day I woke up it was brilliant sunny day I found a clearing nearby and sat on a rock I started crying uncontrollably I grabbed my Rifle loaded a round in the chamber put the muzzle in my mouth and pulled the trigger ....the round didn't fire I immediately thought of my daughter and how selfish what I had just tried to do was I lost it completely I cried and sobbed until I couldn't cry any longer and made a decision then and there that I would never do something so selfish and stupid ever again, I also decided that I had to move forward with my life to do this i would move overseas to a different country where my family were situated get a good job in the mines and rebuild my life again. (Oh and before I forget I'm still not sure why the bullet didn't fire that day I was using old ww2 era 303 Tracer ammo had shot thousands of the same type of ammo and never had one misfire I inspected the rounds primer and it had a good strike on it from the firing pin and the gunpowder stripes were dry so the only conclusion I came to was a faulty primer)

I stayed out hunting for another 4 weeks every day I was out I was getting stronger and stronger and Tony was coming out every few days (I never told him about my suicide attempt)

two weeks later I had sold everything and brought my tickets left the country and went home to my mother 5 sisters and Brother 2 weeks after that I had a job in an open cut mine as a shotfirer with an annual salary of over $200,000 a year

I was on a Fly in fly out FIFO roster of two weeks on one week off and in this time, I kept in contact with my wife and daughter, and I was truly hoping at reconciliation every time I had off, I sent my Wife $2,000 cash and clothes and stuff for Kaylee. I also kept in contact with Tony & Emma and on a call with Tony 6 months later he asked me if I was sending my wife any money I told him that I was and it was $2,000 a month there was silence on the phone I knew there was something very wrong, so I asked him to just come out and say it he then told me how my wife had admitted to Emma that she had been cheating on me 6 months before her leaving me I lost it i hung up and immediately called my wife who I confronted about the accusation and it took over 60 minutes of lies and deflection and accusations for her to admit the truth when she knew that I knew about her cheating and that it was truly over between us she changed completely she did the only thing left for her to hurt me with our daughter she cut all contact between us

As I had money, I contracted lawyers to start family court proceedings to reestablish contact between me and my daughter it took 10 months and over $40,000 in Lawyers' fees I won the case and was given my rights back as a father I started video calling Kaylee every Tuesday and Thursday this lasted for about a year and a half until my wife discovered that i was no longer working in the mines on the good money so she then cut all contact again for the second time breaking the family court ruling but with nothing to fight it with this time

How can someone you loved so completely turn into something so Evil I can't comprehend it ? I could never have done what she did to me and Kaylee. My wife has stolen something that I will never ever get back. The last time i saw my daughter she was 5 she is now 15 i think about her all the time i am in constant sadness",4,1759480305.0,Marriage,12,0.7,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1759480233.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

we were married in 2009

we had our Daughter in 2010

I was an Operations Manager for a nationwide Security Company I'm in charge of large region in the country managing a staff of between 100=120 depending on the time of year. Previously I served over 11 years in the Army (Paratrooper, Qualified unit & Army Sniper)

My wife's pregnancy was difficult towards the end she has pre eclampsia, Pregnancy Diabetes and high blood pressure when my wife went into labor she was 2 weeks early the birth ended up taking 3 days our Daughter Kaylee was finally born but due to her early birth and all the Drugs they gave my wife to induce labor and that Kaylee had Jaundice our Daughter had to spend 3 weeks in the special care unit, I held our Daughters tiny hand as they put a tube in her nose to feed her. My wife was able to stay with her the entire time as in the Special unit they had rooms for the mothers i still went to work during this time I'd wake up at 5am to be at the special care unit to be at the special care unit and after 7 days to help Kaylee's 6am feeding go to work at 8am then spend my lunch hour at the hospital at 12pm then back at work at 1300hrs finish work at 1700hrs back home to wash wife's clothes cook her some dinner then up to the special care unit by 1830hrs home by 2200hrs to start it all again, my wife started showing the signs of post-natal depression so after two weeks I brought my family home I took two weeks off work and we started to get used to our new life as a family with my wife's post-natal depression I decided to do all of Kaylees feedings during the night as my wife was expressing milk so this was possible after the two weeks was up I had to go back to work so I kept sneaking home to do housework and sort my wife's lunch to try and help her through this tough time, after a few months she started to get better.

when Kaylee was around 2 years old my wife's mother had a heart attack and almost died and my wife fell back into a deep depression this seemed to be worse than previous and nothing I did seemed to make a difference so I asked my wife if she wanted to move closer to her family just in case to which she jumped at the idea and said yes (this turned out to be the worst decision of my life) anyway I gave my notice in at work and we made arrangements to move the 500 miles from my family to hers.

I found a house brought it and we moved in not far from her parents' house, but not once did they come to our home to visit or for coffee nothing that should have been the first red flag anyway it didn't take long to see why my wife had moved so far from her family ! her entire family Mother, Father & Brother treated my wife like a doormat and very badly always taunting and picking on her calling her Fat or insulting her looks or ideas and generally being very mean towards her. Now as my wife's husband if you insult my wife, you are insulting me in my opinion so I would start defending her to her family which would always end up with everyone fighting me Including my wife. After about 6 months of this I turned to my wife on the drive home and told her that I would no longer be going to her parents' house. After about a week my wife started to get very depressed again as she didn't have me defending her any longer this time, I didn't know what to do to help her, so I suggested that's on a Friday or Saturday that she go out with her old friends to reconnect to friends (my second biggest mistake)

these nights would usually start out with her meeting her friends at her parents' house have a few drinks then head into town. I wasn't aware that my wife's mother Lynnly was inviting my wife's old boyfriends around at the same time during this time sex between me and my wife started to get even less infrequent prior to our wedding it was 2-3 times a day after the wedding it was once every couple of days to once a week after the birth of our daughter. The wife would usually come home drunk and be wasted for the weekend which suited me fine as i would just start going out with our daughter to the parks or train rides or bush walks

the day my wife left me that morning she fucked my brains out before work then broke up with me in the afternoon to say this hit me as a surprise was a massive understatement (I still was unaware of my wife's infidelity) the first few days I pleaded and begged for us to try and fix things but no matter what I said it only made her more adamant to leave I curled up in a corner of our house with the blinds close I just wanted to die I was hurt confused and in a state of constant disbelief, I couldn't eat anything every time i tried I was physically sick after a couple of weeks my wife brought a bus ticket back to my family where we originally came from

I stayed at friends we had set up the best man at my wedding Anthony a guy I had served in that army with and Emma my wife's friend and bridesmaid I was living in their garage after a week I decided I just needed to get away from everyone and everything to I grabbed my hunting gear my friend Tony drove me out to the bush and he told me he was concerned for my well-being I told him that he had nothing to worry about, but he said that he was coming out every few days to check on me he headed off and I headed in as it was around 1700hrs I only had about two hours of daylight so I headed in and made camp. the next day I woke up it was brilliant sunny day I found a clearing nearby and sat on a rock I started crying uncontrollably I grabbed my Rifle loaded a round in the chamber put the muzzle in my mouth and pulled the trigger ....the round didn't fire I immediately thought of my daughter and how selfish what I had just tried to do was I lost it completely I cried and sobbed until I couldn't cry any longer and made a decision then and there that I would never do something so selfish and stupid ever again, I also decided that I had to move forward with my life to do this i would move overseas to a different country where my family were situated get a good job in the mines and rebuild my life again. (Oh and before I forget I'm still not sure why the bullet didn't fire that day I was using old ww2 era 303 Tracer ammo had shot thousands of the same type of ammo and never had one misfire I inspected the rounds primer and it had a good strike on it from the firing pin and the gunpowder stripes were dry so the only conclusion I came to was a faulty primer)

I stayed out hunting for another 4 weeks every day I was out I was getting stronger and stronger and Tony was coming out every few days (I never told him about my suicide attempt)

two weeks later I had sold everything and brought my tickets left the country and went home to my mother 5 sisters and Brother 2 weeks after that I had a job in an open cut mine as a shotfirer with an annual salary of over $200,000 a year

I was on a Fly in fly out FIFO roster of two weeks on one week off and in this time, I kept in contact with my wife and daughter, and I was truly hoping at reconciliation every time I had off, I sent my Wife $2,000 cash and clothes and stuff for Kaylee. I also kept in contact with Tony & Emma and on a call with Tony 6 months later he asked me if I was sending my wife any money I told him that I was and it was $2,000 a month there was silence on the phone I knew there was something very wrong, so I asked him to just come out and say it he then told me how my wife had admitted to Emma that she had been cheating on me 6 months before her leaving me I lost it i hung up and immediately called my wife who I confronted about the accusation and it took over 60 minutes of lies and deflection and accusations for her to admit the truth when she knew that I knew about her cheating and that it was truly over between us she changed completely she did the only thing left for her to hurt me with our daughter she cut all contact between us

As I had money, I contracted lawyers to start family court proceedings to reestablish contact between me and my daughter it took 10 months and over $40,000 in Lawyers' fees I won the case and was given my rights back as a father I started video calling Kaylee every Tuesday and Thursday this lasted for about a year and a half until my wife discovered that i was no longer working in the mines on the good money so she then cut all contact again for the second time breaking the family court ruling but with nothing to fight it with this time

How can someone you loved so completely turn into something so Evil I can't comprehend it ? I could never have done what she did to me and Kaylee. My wife has stolen something that I will never ever get back. The last time i saw my daughter she was 5 she is now 15 i think about her all the time i am in constant sadness",11,1759479941.0,cheating_stories,5,0.92,False

It's just something that's been interesting me for some time and I'd like to test it, and I just wanted some experienced input from users from this subreddit.

I am a male currently weigh about 231lbs at 5'8. Ball park >35% bf? I figured I'd try to find a way to get a short cut way this winter before I hate my self for not trying to at least to attempt at making myself improve. A very narcissistic idea also rings, ""if others can do it, why can't you?""

I currently have plans for the nest three days to ease into it before my electrolytes arrive, and I am trying to avoid a keto flu as well, just eating regular foods for calories but increasing on nuts and calories will go as follows on the next three days: 1800, 1200, 600, then begin waterfasting.

I formulated the following using reddit and ai:

Electrolytes (ie snake juice?): Mixing half tsps of baking soda, himalayan salt, no salt, and epsom salts to sip through out the day.

Added supplements: Probably fish oils to curb gallstones from happening, or minimizing. Uncertain about vitamins yet.

Allowed drinks: Black coffee, water, and green tea.

Exercises: General body weight exercises that target muscles to minimize muscle loss for an hour, a hour walk in the morning and a hour walk at night for a total of 3 hours.

Monitoring: Regular BP checks for fluctuation, journaling and told a family member.

So far that's all I've gotten. I just worry that I won't be able to function regularly when it comes to working, or any long term damages to myself. I will also probably head to a doctor to get blood work done afterwards. As for refeeding, there's plenty of safety nets and info on that so I'm not so worried. Longest ever water fast for me was about 7 days.

I want to estimate this around 50 days? At least I hope I can last until then.

Any warnings of things to watch out for, general advice, or what to expect from this subreddit would be greatly appreciated. Again, do not recommend to anyone and thanks everyone once again.",1,1759479419.0,Water_Fasting,0,1.0,False

I’m not very chatty at work, but Ray’s countless hrs of trying to make conversation with me eventually paid off and we became good buddies. Eventually me, him, and some other coworkers became close enough to all go out together to the club and we all started going once a month or so, but Ray and I were the 2 most consistent of the group. I lived really close to downtown and after a night of getting ridiculously thrashed I offered him a couch to crash on so he didn’t have to drive home that night. After that he stayed the night at my place all the time and we soon became really close friends.

 Eventually he started staying over almost every night and would hang out with me and my roommate, we even went grocery shopping and started cooking meals together and carpooling to work on days our shifts lined up. Ray was living at my house full time for 3-4/7 days of the week. 

One night after a scary movie he asked if he could stay with me in my room and I agreed to it. We both had a great nights rest and I felt bad leaving him on the couch on nights after that, so we just started sleeping in my bed all the time. During this time I just want to state that we’re both queer and he currently has a partner (Julie), so it was honestly just like sharing a bed with any of my other gal-friends or whatever. I know it’s a lot more common for girls to casually shared beds and stuff like that, so I just want to clarify that it totally had the sleepover vibe going on, nothing sus. It was like this for a month or so before one night he said that I make him nervous (like crushy-butterflies type stuff) and asked of that makes me uncomfortable. I asked if it was like FEELINGS or something and he said no, so I said it was fine and I just appreciate the good vibes and he agreed. 

Everything was the same after that, so I didn’t think too much of it. Also Ray’s girlfriend was aware of him staying over all the time and was comfortable and supportive of our friendship. Things were great for another 2 months, but one day after a night out he asked to kiss me and things totally spiraled from there. We were fucking every day for like 2 weeks and we’re totally wrapped up in each other.Once again we had approval from his partner. Ray and his partner, Julie are in an open/polyamorous relationship which they mainly agreed on so that they could both enjoy the full range of their sexualities, but also because they’re currently long distance. 

We talked about it and he asked if I was okay with the change in our relationship, and I told him I was comfortable as long as I had confirmation of 2 things. 

1. His partner is 1000% sure they’re comfortable with it
2. That Ray originally spent time with me because he saw me as a friend, not because he was playing some twisted sort of game to sleep with me. (I’ve had fake male friends in the past that have done this before)

He assured me that both were 100% the case. All the vibes were good and still platonic, no romance. 

Then his partner visited one week, so we didn’t spend much time together which was fine and I was happy he got to spend time with his partner. But after she was gone he only came over a couple more times before he went on a trip with her, and when he got back from that he started being ‘busy’ all the time. And that ‘busy’ time turned into 3 months. And then the last month or so he stopped talking to me at work altogether unless absolutely necessary.

 I was really sad that our relationship had started to crumble. He said he was busy and going through a lot. I tried to casually reach out once in a while to provide support, but my offers were just politely declined. I’m not asking him to live with me again, but we can’t even catch up over coffee? I felt so hurt and forgotten it was devastating. This person who was living in my home, sharing my food and my bed just vanished after a couple weeks? And now he’s ignoring me altogether? 

And today I found out from another coworker that he got a new job and is leaving. And Ray wasn’t even going to tell me, he was just going to fucking disappear until I asked about him??? He used to wait for me so we could take our breaks together and would call me if he was out sick that day. Now I don’t even deserve to know he’s leaving? 

I just don’t understand what I did or why he just left me without any real explanation. He can’t even admit that he’s abandoned our friendship. And it hurts so much because he was the first friend I made outside of collage and I was so excited to have found someone that I really clicked with. I want to try to reach out more and try to revive our friendship, but I think he’s just done with me. Is it worth making the effort to save it? CAN I even save it? If he’s really just been struggling I would feel horrible for giving up on him, but I feel like an idiot reaching out to someone who doesn’t give a shit about me. 

My roommate and I came up with some theories to try to make me feel better, or give me some kind of illusion of closure. 

On to the theories:
1. he caught feelings and got scared and backed off and ghosted me
2. he lied about his partner being comfortable with our relationship and got in trouble with her at some point or she changed her mind and asked him to stop seeing me
3. It’s really not that deep, I’m so stupid and he probably just used me until he got bored.

IDK ive just been really upset about all of this and could use some perspective. Im not sure if it is it worth trying to salvage this or just to find peace with it. And why did he do this? Why doesn’t he care about me anymore?
