1msrt5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1msrt5n/delve_into_whether_dztz_trash_bags_really_handle/,Delve Into Whether DZTZ Trash Bags Really Handle Daily Waste Well,"Testing out the DZTZ DZTZ-LJD trash bags in my daily routine turned out to be far more interesting than I initially imagined. Who knew a simple item like a trash bag could provoke so many thoughts? I took these golden little warriors for a spin in every corner of my life—from the kitchen to the garden, and even to my bathroom. Here’s what I found after putting them to the test.

**Unexpected Durability**  
One of the aspects that caught my attention was their surprising sturdiness. Despite being described as thin, these bags held their ground remarkably well. Made with HDPE materials, they promised durability, and I was genuinely impressed that they didn’t tear or leak even when dealing with contents like wet coffee grounds or vegetable peels. The reinforced thickening upgraded design is no joke, and it became clear these bags could take a beating from daily use without causing disasters.

[Check DZTZ DZTZ-LJD price on Amazon.](https://info.sanue.com/p/b07g16gpkg/)  

**Versatility Across Spaces**  
You might think trash bags are… well, just trash bags. But trust me, these are more than that. I used them in my office bin for shredded papers, in my car for leftover fast-food packaging (don’t judge me), and even in my kid’s room where they served as a temporary storage solution for toys during a clean-up frenzy. Their size, 17.7 inches by 19.7 inches, is perfect for small to mid-sized bins—ideal for spaces like the bedroom or kitchen. Their multipurpose utility made them a low-key hero in maintaining order around the house.

**A Hint of Style with the Golden Color**  
The golden hue of the DZTZ trash bags added an unexpected aesthetic element. I wouldn’t say they turned taking out the trash into a glamorous event, but they looked so much better than boring black or transparent bags. It didn’t feel as depressing to throw these into the bin, and honestly, who doesn’t love a little sparkle in mundane chores?

**Strengths**  
• Impressive durability against leaks and tears  
• Multipurpose functionality supports various uses  
• Stylish design with unique gold color  
• Eco-friendly materials that break stereotypes about traditional plastic bags  

**Deficiencies**  
• Not ideal for heavy or sharp items like glass shards  
• Limited size range, as they’re only suitable for smaller or medium bins  
• Price feels slightly higher compared to generic alternatives  

**Ease of Use in Organizing Seasonal Items**  
Organizing became undeniably easier with these bags. Seasonal clothes, holiday decorations, and even blankets found a temporary home inside the sturdy plastic. Because they’re clear, I didn’t have to dig through piles of mystery bags, and that small touch saved me during my chaotic morning routine when I habitually lose track of things.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing these bags with market competitors revealed some clear differences. Generic store-brand trash bags might win in cost-effectiveness, but they often lack the durability and tear resistance seen here. Brands like Glad or Hefty generally dominate the trash bag space, but they rarely offer similar compact sizes combined with high-density polyethylene material. However, DZTZ bags don’t dethrone premium heavy-duty products that specialize in larger trash cans or heavy trash scenarios.

**Smart Spending**  
Decision-making on whether these bags justify their price boils down to priorities. If you’re looking for compact, durable, and medium-sized trash solutions with a touch of class (thanks, gold finish), these are worth the investment. On the other hand, if you’re hunting for something for heavier, larger trash loads, you might need to reconsider. Overall, they deliver excellent quality for specialized uses.

1msrozr,https://i.redd.it/0chjb0f76ljf1.jpeg,"Intro, background and my journey","Hello fellow dieters!!
So a little background, I have always been chubby since coming out of my teens (I am now 45) and have been gradually gaining weight until rectly I was my heaviest at 125kg (275lbs) just before I went on holiday in mid June. 
I do have a few issues such as mild hypertension, cholesterol, severe OSA controlled with a CPAP, Fatty Liver, pre diabetic which has led to Acanthosis Nigricans, knee joints inflammation, back issues. Enough was enough so I went to ADF or should I say the 36/12 version of ADF.
I am if south Asian descent so a precursor for nearly all of the above plus due to genetics, it looks like I will loose belly fat last 🤷🏽‍♂️ oh well.... I could easily skip meals before and snacking was not really there but bad habits were. I was barely drinking a glass a water a day, sometimes 2 or 3. My liquid intake consisted of cola with more or less every meal, sweetened chai (tea) just don't ask how many sugars were in there (3 to 4 spoons 🫣) and vegetables were scarce, fruits... None. My work leaves me behind a desk most days, still felt shattered at the end of my workday which meant taking a nap. A 30 min nap that turned to 3 to 4 hours. And, dear redditors, as you probably guessed it, this lead to late night/early morning sleeps usually about 1 to 3am wake up for about 8 am, rinse and repeat. It's a downward spiral that I needed snapping out of. I loved eating out! Give me a grilled kebab at any time and I wouldn't refuse. So snapping in motion I am now in my 2nd week of back to back ADF. I decided to modify it a bit to better suit my lifestyle so here is my schedule:
Monday 10pm to Wednesday 10am - Fast 1
Wednesday 10pm to Friday 10am - Fast 2
Friday 10pm to Sunday 10am - Fast 3
The rest of Sunday and to Monday 10pm normal eating - so this gives me a 36 hours reset window.

Why did I leave a reset window?
The answer to that is 2 folds:
- It allows me to have a consistent schedule every week
- I have heard that the body gets used to eating windows after a while so in effect feeding for 36 hours will be seen as a rest and keep the body guessing.
My fasts are clean, only water, sparkling water unflavoured , black tea, black coffee or green tea all with no milk or sugar

Breaking my fast, eating window and tracking
I use fasting circles to track my food and fasts. I also use chatGPT to guesstimate the nutrients in home made south Asian dishes and it turns out to be pretty accurate. I want to keep my muscle tone (😂) as much as I can so protein tracking is a must and so are other macronutrients. I am aiming for the following:
150g carbs
140g protein
70g fat
30g fiber
All within 2000kcal 
It's a tough ask but doable 
I am breaking my fast with 200g greek yoghurt (0% or 5% fat) with a tablespoon of chia seeds and a banana
Fizzy drinks/soda completely cut out
I am a little careful with what I eat but I do indulge occasionally (my local fish and chips have won several award and very deserved to) but I  try to control portions.
I used to look down on protein shake as I tried it ages ago and it had a terrible after taste. I must say the new ones are considerably better!!

For this curious, here are my stats 
General
Height 5ft11 
Weight before going on holiday 125kg 276lbs
Body fat 40%
After returning from holiday 120kg 265lbs
Body fat 38.5%

Target
Height -hopefully still the same lol
Weight 80kg 176lbs

Current status
Just completed my second week of 36/12 Fasts. I find the hardest point is 16 to 24 hours into my fasts when I get hunger pangs. I found that having a protein shake a half hour before my fast starts truly satisfying and helps me get over the hump. 
I was using a 4 sensor body analysing scale from Mi which are not as accurate as the 8 sensor one (the one with the handle) so I invested in that. I have attached my current composition for anyone that wants to see it. It looks like it will be about 8 to 9 months  to 12 months before getting to my target. I am expecting some plateaus in the meanwhile. My water intake has gone up to roughly 2 litres a day and trying to work up to 3 hours but it makes you pee like a trooper! Hopefully that will settle. 
Anyway, wish me luck and if you want to jump on the bandwagone, there's is truly nothing better. I am today at 115kg and for 2 weeks, I think thats not bad!
It would be nice to hear from you, let me know what you think and any questions please ask away! 
Good luck to all, keep your chin high and here is to a better you!

I am sharing this here, because a lot of you try to date when travelling in Europe and think it is too difficult. 

- Their English is as bad as yours if not worse in most cases. So don’t be intimidated, they are as good with their language as you are with yours. Be confident. 

- Use Bumble and Tinder, different countries have different preferences so using both improves your chances. 

- Dress to blend in and not to stand out. The average European doesn’t want everyone looking at them. They are not really flashy people, so pick the local style and stick to it. 

- First date for dinner is generally better than coffee. Europeans are like Indians in the sense that coffee is part of their day to day life, so if you are asking someone on a date while in Europe, better to go with a light dinner. 

- Do not use fruity perfumes or Attar type fragrances. Europeans are much more likely to not like you if you smelled like a North-African or Middle-Eastern. 

- Please be upfront about your intentions. People are pretty open, so no point in lying on your profile that you are there for work or college when in-fact you are just travelling. I have heard this from multiple women. 

- Swipe ahead of time in the location you are heading to. People take a couple of days at least to feel you out, so if you are staying in a city for less than week, swipe in that city a week before. 

- Avoid Africans, especially North-Africans in France, Germany, Sweden and Netherlands. A lot of them target Indians looking to date and steal phones and valuables from them. North-Africans are known to sexually assault female travellers when they are alone, so avoid areas like that especially at night. Blacks are fine, the Egyptians, Algerians, Moroccans are the ones you need to watch out for. 

- Indian skin colour is considered exotic, so if you have dusky skin wear clothing that makes your tone stand out like sky blue, white, cream, etc. 

Lastly, good sex is cheap in Europe. The culture is pretty progressive, so please keep it in your pants and don’t take rejection like you do in India. There is plenty of fish for everyone. 
This is especially for men, particularly men from places like Delhi, Punjab and Haryana - they are the worst offenders from what I have heard from women. 

I am happy to answer any questions you might have.

I’m almost certain it’s a sketch show and not a comedy series. There’s a woman in not-Starbucks who’s just asking for a coffee and is constantly being questioned by the barista (who I think is also a woman) and she doesn’t understand these new overly elaborate coffee shops. I think it’s Sarah Alaxander and Michelle Gomez it if it’s not it’s their style and genre. 

the dialogue was basically ‘one coffee’ ‘cappuccino, latte, mocha’ ‘eh… coffee’ mpetit, grande, medium’ ‘eh.. coffee’ and the barista is horrifically condescending.

The humour came from the fact that these new coffee shops were complicating coffee and we didn’t get it. They were much on the wrong side of history there.

1msri03,https://www.reddit.com/r/cymbalta/comments/1msri03/i_messed_up/,I messed up!,"I've been on Duloxetine since late 2019. At some point during covid, I got down from 70mg to 30mg, and I honestly don't recall struggling to do that. Some context, I've tried a few different meds. My first was citalopram and got up to 80mg (always had issues getting this prescirption filled, pharmacist red flags), I actually managed to wean off this without help (I know, bad). After trying a few different things, I was on Fluoxetine for a bit, then was switched to Duloxetine. My GP at the time assured me that it was easy to come off of, and would be able to help with my generalised chronic pain (PCOS, hypermobility, maybe EDS/fibro), anxiety, depression. Luckily I haven't had a psychosomatic seizure since being on it, which was a big issue for me at the time, as well as 'sleep panic attacks' . Tbh it's the only one of the meds that has helped long term, but I feel like I'm struggling cognitively, want to have children eventually etc. 

Anyway, going down to 20mg failed once before in 2022, I had no issues until I travelled for some family things which was a stressor for me. I saw a return of 'sleep panic attacks'. I went back up to 30mg when I got back from my travels and thst was fine/smooth as far as I can remember.

Most recently, I actually forgot a dose 5 nights ago, felt fine the next day, then decided to just take 20mg for two days kind of on a whim, I thought it would be fine. Queue me having a horrific panic attack after drinking my normal morning coffee the morning after my 2nd 20mg dose + having gut issues and body pain. I then went back on the 30mg, and have taken 2 so far. It was a silly move as I only have 1 month left of a heavy clinical training programme so it's a high stress period anyway, but I digress. I read about microtapering which I'd like to try in a month when my training is done. 

The issue is, after 2 days back on 30mg, I mentally am at my worst out of all the days. Worse than the no dose day, the 20mg days, the first day back on 30mg. I'm just so damn anxious. I woke up anxious, took a nap, woke up anxious. I just don't feel normal. I'm terrified I've like permanently broken my brain or something. I've read varying reports of when you 'get back to normal' after a failed taper and going back to a comfortable doses - anything from 5 days to 2 weeks is what I've seen. I know pharmacologically / neurochemically this will pass, but I'm terrified it won't. I guess I'm seeking advice from others who have had to back track from a 20mg to 30mg taper. I really thought I just feel better from the first 30mg. ",1,1755438770.0,cymbalta,0,1.0,False

1msrgiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1msrgiq/find_out_if_superbio_compost_bags_truly_handle/,Find Out if Superbio Compost Bags Truly Handle Daily Food Waste,"**A Real-World Evaluation of SUPERBIO 1.6H1 Compostable Food Scrap Bags**

The SUPERBIO 1.6H1 compostable food scrap bags have found a regular place in my kitchen, primarily because I wanted to move away from traditional plastic and embrace environmentally friendly options. These compostable bags seemed perfect for handling food waste, especially since they are certified by BPI and OK compost INDUSTRIAL. My daily use has shed light on many features I love, but a few quirks might make you think twice.

**Design That Makes Life Easier**

One immediate highlight is the thoughtful design featuring tie handles and a star-sealed reinforced bottom. This combination adds both convenience and functionality. The tie handles make securing the bag a breeze, especially when it's full. During use, the reinforced bottom lived up to its claims by preventing leakage—even with heavier loads of damp kitchen scraps. But let’s be real: its compact 1.6-gallon size works wonders in smaller households or for countertop compost bins like mine. For families generating larger amounts of waste, though, these might fill up quicker than you'd like.

**Key Benefits**

- Durably designed with reinforced bottoms to prevent leaks.
- Convenient tie handles for easy trash disposal.
- Certified compostable and eco-friendly.
- Compact size ideal for countertop compost bins.

[Check SUPERBIO 1.6H1 price on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b0b1l4bsjt/)

**Durability That Surprised Me**

These bags were much sturdier than I expected for something compostable. Let’s face it, many eco-bags tend to have a flimsy feel, but not these. I even tested them out with slightly damp materials like leftover pasta, peels, and coffee grounds—things I assumed might stress the material. To my surprise, the bags held up without tearing under this moisture combined with weight. However, their durability does have limits. If you're dealing with stuff like acidic leftovers (think marinated lemon slices), these might start to weaken within three days unless emptied promptly. 

**Storage Considerations**

One thing to keep in mind, though, is storage. These bags demand a cool, dry spot, and if left unused for over a year, they can start breaking down. This is great news when you think about their contribution to reducing waste but worth noting if you order in bulk. Storing them near heat sources like the stove? Forget it—that’s a fast track to soft, unusable bags. From my personal experience, keeping them in an under-sink cabinet with a dehumidifier works best.

**Shortcomings**

- Not suitable for long-term storage (around 1-year shelf life).
- Breaks down after three days with organic waste, especially with acidic or alkaline materials.
- Requires cool, dry storage.

**Environmental Impact and Certifications**

The certifications these bags boast are pretty impressive—meeting ASTM D6400 and EN 13432 standards while carrying endorsements from BPI and TÜV. Knowing they comply with industrial composting standards gave me peace of mind about reducing my carbon footprint. That said, not all areas have the facilities to support commercial composting, so I’d recommend checking local availability before committing to these.

**Product Rivals**

While SUPERBIO gets plenty of things right, I’ve also tried similar compostable bags like those from BioBag and UNNI. BioBag offers durable alternatives with comparable certifications and slightly more robust handling of kitchen waste over multiple days. However, they seemed less environmentally friendly in initial packaging. UNNI bags were another close competitor but felt thinner and more prone to leaks when pushed to heavier limits. SUPERBIO bags strike the balance nicely but slightly falter in size—BioBag’s 3-gallon ones better cater to larger households.

**Cost Efficiency**

In terms of price to quality, these compostable bags deliver good value, albeit for a specific user base. If you’re serious about transitioning to an eco-friendly lifestyle and don’t need excessive bag capacity, this is a solid buy. Compared to other premium compostable bags, the SUPERBIO option is equally functional without the unnecessary bells and whistles that drive up costs. What truly makes it worth the investment for me is the assurance of certifications and reliable performance with everyday kitchen waste.

1msreb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tunisia/comments/1msreb6/emotional_estrangement_between_me_and_my_brother/,Emotional estrangement between me and my brother,"

I have only one brother. He’s 27 and I’m 24(a girl).When we were kids, we were really close. We used to play together and do everything together. He was like my best friend.

But as we got older, things changed, which is normal. After puberty, boys often prefer spending time with their male friends, and that’s fine. The problem was his attitude toward me. He started controlling what I wore and who I hung out with, supposedly to protect me, and at the same time, he became more distant.

At home, he’s still affectionate. He hugs me, kisses me, and shows love. But whenever we talk or discuss something, he gets easily irritated when I share my opinions, sometimes asking questions like, “How do you know that?” Over time, I learned to think twice before telling him anything.

Even when I suggest doing something together, like going out for coffee or dinner as siblings or as a family, he refuses and gets annoyed. I’ve never understood why, but I usually don’t get upset. I just let it go.

But recently this started to bother me because he would do the same things he refused to do with me with our female cousins.
He would go to a swim with them ( even tho they wear bikinis and i dress modestly comapred to them. I’ve always thought that he refuses to swim with me because of my swimwear i thought i may embarrass him in front of people since he’s overprotective).

Also he took one of them to another city because she wanted to discover the place, were so nice to her and patient.
And he had never took me to any place even tho i asked him to and expressed how much i wanted to see a certain place.

His behaviour made me really sad, because i’ve always wanted to have a strong bond with him, to be close to him since he’s all i’ve got in this life besides my mother.

I know he loves me and i do love him, but our relationship is based on fear from my part and emotional boundaries from his.

I was in town with my mom and my older sister Emma. Emma was trying to put money into an ATM, but it wasn’t working, so I got annoyed and stepped aside. Then I tried to help, and Emma said, “You’re so annoying, you ruin everything.” I felt taken aback and went into a store to cool off. A few minutes later, my mom called and asked, “Where are you?” She sounded angry. I said, “Wouldn’t you like to know?” and hung up. She called again and yelled, “Why did you hang up on me?!” I said where I was and hung up again. She called one more time, still angry, and I repeated that I was there and hung up.
Then Emma came and said mom got mad and just left her there, saying “I can’t deal with this.” Kind of weird for a mom to just leave her daughter, but okay. We went to a cafe where mom was and said we were going to another place. Mom said, “I’ll get coffee and come later.” Emma and I went. We called our dad (my parents are divorced) and told him what happened. We then saw mom literally two meters away from us, “looking at things,” but to me it felt like she was following us. We left and went somewhere else, but mom was nowhere. Later we went back to the cafe and mom showed up. I didn’t want to talk to her, so I went somewhere else. She pretended like nothing had happened. I got annoyed, so I went to another place. Mom called saying, “You can’t just leave, where are you, we’re waiting for you.” I said, “Stop pretending like nothing happened, and stop yelling. You’re being childish.” Then I hung up again. Emma called, and I told her where I was.
After finishing, I went home. At home, mom came into my room to try to talk. She was being annoying, so I said, “Dad said I don’t have to apologize, so I’m not going to.” (I misunderstood dad, who only meant I didn’t need to apologize right away. I admit that part was on me.) Anyway, mom tried talking to me, I laughed at what she said because it felt weird, then she cried and left. She’s never in her life apologized to me, even if it’s her fault she has something to turn it so it’s suddenly my fault. AITAH?

TL;DR: I got upset when my sister called me annoying at the ATM, so I walked away. My mom kept calling and yelling at me, and I hung up multiple times. She also left my sister alone and pretended like nothing happened. Later when we talked my mom cried and left. AITAH?

1msrcyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1msrcyu/should_you_buy_the_best_breakfast_station/,Should You Buy the Best Breakfast Station Nostalgia Retro 3-in-1,"The Nostalgia BST3RR has quickly become a central part of my daily routine. The appeal of the retro diner style, with its bold red color and chrome accents, caught my eye immediately, and it looks fantastic sitting on my kitchen counter. It’s not just about the aesthetics, though. This 3-in-1 breakfast station has convinced me it’s more than just a novelty appliance—it’s a fully functional space saver that tackles multiple morning tasks.

**Performance Made Convenient**

Trying out the Nostalgia BST3RR, I loved how this compact kitchen gadget packs a punch with three functionalities. The coffee maker brewing a fresh, hot pot of coffee right alongside the griddle and toaster oven was a game changer. I tested all the components during a morning rush, and they worked seamlessly. The coffee maker brewed up to 3 cups—perfect to sip on while bacon and eggs cooked on the non-stick griddle. While I waited, the oven toasted evenly, handling up to four slices at once.  

[Check Nostalgia BST3RR price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b07wfhz8rm/)

**Design and Space Efficiency**

The space-saving design is one of its biggest strengths. Living in a city apartment, counter space is a premium, and this unit fits perfectly without leaving me feeling cramped. It's easy to move around, too, weighing in at just under 12 pounds. Though compact, none of the features felt cramped or compromised, and I found each part accessible without needing to juggle things around.

**Ease of Use**

Being someone who doesn’t enjoy overly complicated appliances, this breakfast station's controls were straightforward. The knobs for adjusting the toaster oven settings and the one-touch coffee maker switch made operation intuitive. There’s no confusion about what does what, and even a guest could figure it out without much instruction. The included components, like the wire racks and oven tray, were easy to fit into their spaces, making it simple to alternate between tasks.

**Merits**

- The 1950s-inspired look adds a pop of retro flair to any kitchen.
- Compact, all-in-one design saves precious countertop space.
- Features simple, foolproof controls for time and temperature.
- Non-stick ceramic griddle ensures easy clean-up after cooking.
- The included reusable coffee filter is an eco-friendly bonus.

**Caveats**

- The griddle’s smaller size may be limiting for larger groups or families.
- Brewing only 3 cups of coffee might not suit heavy coffee drinkers.
- The toaster oven lacks the interior space for larger baking tasks.
  
**Competing Brands**

Compared to its industry competitors, this appliance fares well on versatility and style. While other multi-functional appliances exist, many fall short in compactness or design. For instance, larger toaster oven combos may outperform this one in capacity but can overwhelm a smaller kitchen. At the same time, single-function coffee makers or griddles lack the one-stop convenience. If you prioritize a retro touch and efficiency, this one stands out.

**Price Performance**

Talking about cost-effectiveness, I found this breakfast station delivers exceptional value for its price point. Considering it replaces three separate appliances, saving not only money but also counter space, it justifies the investment. It might not suit those looking for professional-grade cooking tools, but for everyday home use, it ticks all the right boxes.

TLDR: can teething cause the same symptoms as cmpi?

Around June 20th (daughters 4month) I had a lactation and pediatrician appointment, when we discussed going dairy free due to the issues we discussed. 

My daughter would arch her back when she was laid down at night, scream in the car (assumed to be due to trapped gas because she would arch when putting her in), go a few days in between dirty diapers, forcefully spit up or “vomit” at night on particularly bad days. She never spit up, so we came to the conclusion she had silent reflux as well. 

 To clarify: no blood/mucus/discolored stool and no rashes

I have been dairy free since then, getting particularly strict (no milk, butter, cheese, hidden milk derivatives) starting July 1, and extremely strict (no cross contamination or products that are “made on a line” with dairy) August 1. Through this time she had flare ups to which the lc suggested cutting out caffeine. So I cut that out about August 1st as well (not even decaf coffee).

Now I know she is young but she has already cut 4 teeth. And I noticed a correlation between flare ups and teething. But the only inconsistency was her projectile spit up, that was every time I tried to take probiotics. 


In your own opinion: would you feel compelled to believe I’m on the right track? Or do you think I could be a little less strict on dairy free (or try the dairy ladder to reintroduce it) ",1,1755438123.0,MSPI,0,1.0,False

I went to meet someone off hinge for a coffee/walk. We’ve been chatting for about 6 weeks, I didn’t mind the time and slowness of it at all, it was one convo over a day a week and then eventually picked up. He asked if I wanted to go on a walk on Tuesday evening, and after I said yes he disappeared for a few days and then confirmed plans on Friday. Ended up meeting Saturday morning. We started chatting and when I asked for his last name, he outright refused, in an annoyed tone told me it doesn’t matter. The reason I asked was because he asked me mine. I did eventually do a Google search after I got home and found his last name, nothing sketchy came up. While we were talking I would say something and he wouldn’t be solely focused on what I was saying, his eyes would shift elsewhere and he would cut me off with whatever caught his interest, and facts he knew about it, and then eventually return to what I was saying or I’d redirect. I mentioned I was a hockey fan, mentioned he used to be, and when I said I didn’t understand baseball and wasn’t really a fan he ensured I did understand it by explaining it instead of just realizing maybe it was just not my thing like I had expressed,and I just prefer to watch hockey instead. When we were chatting online he told me he was detoxing from drinking for a month, yesterday he said he had a drink Friday and broke the detox. He also mentioned he went to a swingers club three times. Twice with a friend and once by himself. The thing was he made it sound like it was a really long time ago, but he also knew the schedule of events and told me about them. I don’t know how to feel about that tbh. We ended up hanging out for a few hours and I was hungry, he asked what I was doing for lunch cuz he planned on going grocery shopping to make food at home. Ended up walking with him cuz it was on my way home. He invited me over twice saying he could make food but I said no, and then when I was about to head off in another direction he walked with me and then said at least come by to drink water since it’s hot and we’ve been out for hours. So I did end up going but was hesitant tbh. He kept his distance at his place and gave me a water bottle to head back home with. I did notice a pack of beers in his fridge but never brought it up. I think he just wanted to show off his space but I felt leaving a bit uneasy. I don’t have much experience with dating and kind of struggle to navigate people so I’m not sure, the whole last name thing also didn’t make sense to me. Do people not like sharing their last name? I keep mine off my dating profile because I don’t want anyone figuring out where I work, but I’d tell someone if I met them, not shut them down for asking. Do people also generally not buy food if it’s past lunch? I was starving to to point my stomach hurt, it was hot outside, but I didn’t want to put someone in a situation to buy food if they didn’t want to spend the money so I didn’t say anything.

1msr711,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1msr711/find_out_if_the_best_coffee_maker_from_kidisle_is/,Find Out if the Best Coffee Maker from KIDISLE is Worth It,"Testing out the KIDISLE KC311 coffee maker over the past few weeks has genuinely been an interesting journey, and I say that as someone who is fairly reliant on my daily caffeine ritual. Honestly, this device ticked several boxes for me right from unboxing. With its compact build and modern design, it intrigued me enough to dive right in. While my experience has largely been positive, there are a few areas where it might not meet everyone's expectations, so buckle up for a detailed ride through the highs and blips of this coffee maker!  

**Compact and Sleek Design**  
One of the first things I noticed was how compact this coffee maker is. Measuring just 11”D x 5.3”W x 11”H, it takes up minimal counter space, which is perfect for someone with a small kitchen like mine. Its modern black exterior blends seamlessly with other appliances, giving my countertop a more cohesive look. The travel-mug-friendly design is also a thoughtful addition. I slid my 6.7-inch travel mug underneath without a hitch, which made my on-the-go mornings so much smoother. This is especially handy for anyone who’s rushing out the door before 8 AM coffee fully kicks in.  

**Highlighted Features**  
- The standout feature for me is its 2-in-1 brewing flexibility. I brewed both K-cup pods and ground coffee, using the included reusable filter, and the results were consistently good.
- The ""Bold"" setting truly elevated my coffee experience. On days when I needed an extra kick, this setting delivered strong, aromatic coffee, which became my go-to.  
- The iced coffee function was such a refreshing addition, especially during those warmer afternoons when a piping hot cup just wouldn't cut it.  

[Check KIDISLE KC311 price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b0dqxrpbg9/)  

**Performance and Convenience**  
Brewing with this coffee maker is ridiculously straightforward. Its one-touch operation meant that even groggy mornings were no impediment to getting my caffeine fix. The quick-brew system lived up to its name. Within mere minutes, I had a steaming hot—or ice-cold—cup of coffee ready. And hey, who doesn’t appreciate speed when you're barely awake?  

What surprised me was the descale reminder, which promptly nudged me after about 150 uses. Following that, activating the built-in self-cleaning mode was a breeze; I just held down the “Iced Coffee” button for a few seconds, and voila! My machine was as fresh as new. This feature feels tailored for busy folks or lazy cleaners like me who’d rather sip on coffee than spend time scrubbing machines.  

**Benefits**  
- Space-saving design for smaller kitchens.  
- Travel-mug compatibility makes it ideal for on-the-go users.  
- Quick-brew performance minimizes waiting times.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While I’ve had a largely enjoyable experience, there are some limitations worth mentioning. For one, the coffee maker’s capacity is inherently geared for single-serve use, which might not satisfy a household of heavy coffee drinkers. The iced coffee feature, although fun, left the coffee slightly more diluted than I’d prefer—it felt like it could pack a bit more flavor punch for iced lovers.  

- Single-serve capacity isn’t practical for larger families or frequent guests.  
- The iced coffee could use a stronger flavor balance.  

**Competitive Options**  
In a market brimming with single-serve brewers, the KC311 doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Products like the Keurig K-Mini offer similar compact designs but come with a higher price tag. That said, the KIDISLE KC311 edges out some competitors with its bold-brew setting and reusable filter, while Keurig models often require separate purchases for such versatility. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew is another contender, equipped with dual brewing features, but I found it slightly bulkier and less travel-mug-friendly compared with this coffee maker. For the coffee-lover needing optimal counter space, this model feels like the more practical choice, even if others cater to higher capacities.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Without diving into exact numerical comparisons, I’d call the KIDISLE KC311 a genuinely budget-friendly option for what it offers. The addition of a reusable filter saves money over time, as you aren't constantly buying single-use pods. Coupled with its multi-functionality, which lets you alternate between hot, iced, bold, or regular brewed coffee, you’re looking at an investment that pays off in versatility. It's not perfect, but for the price point, it punches pretty well above its weight.

There is no way he was able to deep clean / bleach clean that car in 5 hours.

I’ve never thought of this before. I’ve always accepted he did it at 4am and returned at 9am. But never thought how he could use his car the whole next day so brazenly and boldly when the car would have been covered in blood or dna one would think?

# Best iPhone 6 Case with Card Holder 2025: Secure & Stylish

The iPhone 6, despite its age, remains a functional and reliable device for many users. Securing and protecting this valuable piece of technology is paramount, and what better way to do so than with a stylish and functional case that also streamlines your daily carry? The iPhone 6 case with card holder offers the perfect blend of protection, convenience, and style.For those seeking to simplify their lives by reducing the number of items they carry, this type of case is an invaluable accessory.

It eliminates the need for a bulky wallet, allowing users to carry essential cards like IDs and credit cards directly with their phone. This review focuses on the top iPhone 6 cases with card holders expected to dominate the market in 2025, prioritizing security, durability, and aesthetic appeal.

## Key Features Analysis

The iPhone 6 case with card holder has evolved considerably,offering more than just basic protection and card storage; the 2025 iterations boast a range of advanced features aimed at enhancing user experience.

**Secure Card Closure Mechanism**

The primary function of these cases is to securely hold cards. 2025 models utilize various secure closure mechanisms, including a sliding cover with a locking feature, a magnetic clasp, or a reinforced elastic band. Rigorous testing ensures that cards remain firmly in place even during drops or strenuous activity. These mechanisms are also designed for easy card access when needed, ensuring convenience doesn't compromise security.

**Dual-Layer Protection with Shock Absorption**

Advanced cases employ a dual-layer design, consisting of a hard polycarbonate outer shell and a soft TPU inner layer. the outer shell provides impact resistance, preventing damage from accidental drops and bumps. The inner TPU layer absorbs shocks and cushions the phone, minimizing the risk of internal damage. Corner reinforcements are also strategically placed to provide added protection in vulnerable areas.

**RFID Blocking Technology**

With the increasing threat of electronic theft, RFID blocking technology is a crucial feature. These cases incorporate an RFID-blocking layer within the card holder compartment, preventing unauthorized scanning of embedded RFID chips in credit cards and IDs. This safeguarding measure protects sensitive financial details from being compromised by nearby skimming devices. The material used effectively blocks signals, adhering to industry standards for RFID protection.**Precise Cutouts and Tactile Buttons**

Ensuring full access to all phone functions is vital. Cases are meticulously designed with precise cutouts for the camera, charging port, headphone jack, and speakers. Tactile button covers provide responsive and comfortable button presses, maintaining the original tactile feel of the iPhone 6 buttons. These features allow for seamless operation of the phone without needing to remove it from the case.

**Slim Profile Design**

Bulky cases are a thing of the past. The 2025 models prioritize a slim profile design.Despite offering robust protection and card storage, these cases maintain a sleek and lightweight feel. Ergonomic design principles are employed to ensure the case fits comfortably in the hand and slips easily into pockets without adding unnecessary bulk. This slim design is achieved using carefully selected materials and optimized structural design.

## Core Benefits

The core benefits of using an iPhone 6 case with a card holder extend beyond just protection; it streamlines daily life and enhances convenience in numerous ways.

**Reduced Physical Clutter**

The most notable benefit is the reduction of physical clutter. By integrating a card holder directly into the phone case, users can eliminate the need for a separate wallet or purse. This allows for a minimalist carry,consisting of only the essential cards and the phone. This is especially beneficial for those who prefer to travel light or engage in activities where carrying a bulky wallet is inconvenient.

**Enhanced Security Against Theft**

Keeping cards close to your person and in a secure compartment reduces the risk of theft or misplacement. Unlike a wallet, which can be easily lost or stolen, a phone is generally kept close at hand and is more easily noticed if missing. The secure closure mechanisms on the card holder further safeguard against cards accidentally falling out.

**Increased Convenience for Everyday Transactions**

having essential cards readily accessible makes everyday transactions quicker and easier. Whether paying for coffee,groceries,or public transportation,cards are conveniently located on the back of the phone.This eliminates the need to rummage through a wallet or purse, saving time and minimizing hassle.

**Protection from Damage and Wear**

The case itself provides a protective barrier against scratches, drops, and other forms of damage to the iPhone 6. The card holder compartment also shields cards from bending,scratching,and demagnetization. Keeping all valuables together and protected prolongs the life of both the phone and the cards.

## FAQs Section

**How many cards can the case typically hold?**
Most iPhone 6 cases with card holders are designed to accommodate 2-3 cards comfortably. Overloading the compartment can compromise the closure mechanism and potentially damage the cards. Some premium models may accommodate more cards but could sacrifice the slim profile.

**Will the card holder interfere with wireless charging?**
Given that the iPhone 6 dose not support wireless charging by default, this is not a direct concern. However, the added thickness of the case, especially when loaded with cards, may affect the use of older generation docks that provide physical charging and synchronization.

**Are the cases compatible with screen protectors?**
Generally, iPhone 6 cases with card holders are designed to be compatible with most screen protectors.However, it's always best to check the case specifications or read customer reviews to ensure compatibility, especially with thicker or edge-to-edge screen protectors, to avoid any lifting or interference.

**How durable is the card holder closure mechanism?**
The durability of the closure mechanism depends on the quality of materials and the design. High-quality cases use durable materials like reinforced polymers or metal clasps with robust spring mechanisms. Regular use and potential wear and tear are considered during testing phases. Look for cases with positive reviews regarding the longevity of the closure mechanism.

## Key Features Analysis

The world of coffee cup lids has evolved beyond basic functionality. Today's best lids boast innovative designs, sustainable materials, and enhanced features that cater to a variety of consumer preferences.

**Material Composition**

The composition of coffee cup lids varies widely, influencing their durability, heat resistance, and environmental impact. Common materials include polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), compostable bioplastics (PLA, PHA), and even fiber-based materials. Polypropylene offers excellent heat resistance and recyclability, while polystyrene tends to be more brittle and less eco-friendly. Bioplastics, derived from renewable resources like cornstarch, represent a sustainable alternative, even though their compostability frequently enough requires specific industrial facilities. Fiber-based lids, made from molded pulp or recycled paper, are gaining traction for their compostable and biodegradable qualities, but may lack the same level of heat resistance as plastic options. Understanding the material composition is crucial for selecting a lid that aligns with your environmental values and performance expectations.

**Leak-Proof Design**

A truly grate coffee cup lid must excel at preventing leaks and spills,especially for on-the-go consumers. Effective leak-proof designs typically incorporate tight-fitting seals, secure locking mechanisms, or carefully engineered spout geometries. Some lids feature internal gaskets or flanges that compress against the rim of the cup, creating a watertight barrier. Others utilize snap-on or twist-lock closures that provide added security. The spout design also plays a critical role in preventing drips and spills, with features like recessed channels or drip traps that redirect stray droplets back into the cup. Rigorous testing, including drop tests and simulated usage scenarios, is often employed to validate the leak-proof performance of different lid designs, ensuring consumers can confidently transport their coffee without fear of messy accidents.

**Ventilation System**

While preventing leaks is paramount, a good coffee cup lid also needs to allow for adequate ventilation to prevent pressure buildup and ensure smooth pouring. Without proper ventilation, hot coffee can create a vacuum inside the cup, making it difficult to drink and possibly causing the lid to pop off unexpectedly.Ventilation systems typically consist of small openings or channels strategically positioned on the lid to allow air to enter the cup as the liquid is consumed.Some lids incorporate adjustable vents that allow users to control the airflow, optimizing the drinking experience based on their preferences. The design and placement of the vents are crucial for achieving a balance between ventilation and leak prevention, ensuring a comfortable and spill-free drinking experience.

**insulation Properties**

Beyond leak prevention and ventilation, some premium coffee cup lids offer additional features like enhanced insulation to help maintain the temperature of the beverage for longer. These lids often incorporate double-walled construction or insulated materials that reduce heat transfer, keeping coffee hotter for a longer period. Insulated lids are particularly beneficial for consumers who prefer to sip their coffee slowly or who are frequently exposed to colder environments. The effectiveness of the insulation depends on the materials used and the design of the lid, with some models claiming to maintain beverage temperature for up to several hours. While insulated lids may add to the overall cost, they can be a worthwhile investment for those who value temperature retention and wish to avoid lukewarm coffee.

## Core Benefits

The best coffee cup lids offer a range of benefits that enhance the overall coffee-drinking experience, from preventing spills and maintaining temperature to promoting sustainability.

**Spill Prevention & Cleanliness:** A well-designed coffee cup lid is your frist line of defense against accidental spills, saving you from ruined clothes, stained surfaces, and embarrassing moments. Think of navigating a crowded subway or juggling a coffee with your laptop and phone; a reliable lid provides peace of mind, knowing that your precious brew is securely contained. This not only maintains your personal cleanliness but also prevents messes in public spaces, contributing to a more pleasant surroundings for everyone.

**Temperature Retention:** Nobody enjoys lukewarm coffee. Premium coffee cup lids extend the life of your hot beverage by trapping heat and minimizing heat loss.This is particularly beneficial for slow sippers, commuters, or anyone who wants to savor their coffee at its optimal temperature for an extended period. Temperature-retentive lids save you from the disappointment of a rapidly cooling coffee, ensuring a consistently enjoyable drinking experience from the first sip to the last.

**Environmental Responsibility:** With increasing awareness of environmental issues, sustainable coffee cup lids are gaining prominence. Opting for lids made from compostable, biodegradable, or recycled materials reduces reliance on customary plastics, minimizing environmental impact. These eco-friendly alternatives contribute to a circular economy, diverting waste from landfills and reducing our collective carbon footprint. Choosing sustainable lids demonstrates a commitment to environmental stewardship, aligning personal habits with broader sustainability goals.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about coffee cup lids to help you make an informed purchase:

**Are all coffee cup lids recyclable?**
Unfortunately, not all coffee cup lids are easily recyclable. Traditional plastic lids, frequently enough made from polystyrene, can be difficult to recycle due to their low density and potential contamination. Though, polypropylene (PP) lids are generally more readily recyclable in many municipalities. Compostable lids, made from materials like PLA, require industrial composting facilities to break down properly and should not be placed in regular recycling bins. Always check with your local recycling guidelines to determine which types of lids are accepted.

**How do I know if a coffee cup lid is leak-proof?**
The best way to assess the leak-proof performance of a coffee cup lid is to look for lids specifically marketed as leak-proof or spill-resistant. Read product descriptions and reviews carefully, and consider searching for videos that demonstrate the lid's ability to withstand tipping or shaking. Features to look for include tight-fitting seals, secure locking mechanisms, and well-designed spouts with drip traps. It's also helpful to check if the lid has undergone independent testing or certification for leak-proof performance.

**Are compostable coffee cup lids really eco-friendly?**
Compostable coffee cup lids offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional plastic lids,but their true eco-friendliness depends on proper disposal. These lids are designed to break down in industrial composting facilities,where controlled conditions of temperature,humidity,and microbial activity accelerate the decomposition process. However, if compostable lids end up in landfills, they may not decompose properly and can still contribute to environmental problems. To maximize the environmental benefits of compostable lids, ensure they are disposed of in designated composting bins or sent to facilities that can process them effectively.

Being someone who thrives on caffeine-fueled mornings and afternoon pick-me-ups, I knew I had to put these pods to the test. Offering 100% Colombian coffee with a medium roast profile, this product seemed to cater to those who crave a robust yet smooth coffee without venturing into overly bold territory.

**Flavor Experience**

The flavor profile is where this product shines. It delivers a full-body richness with a smooth and robust character. I particularly enjoyed the bright, lively notes that give the coffee a touch of freshness. It starts off rich and warmly aromatic, with a surprisingly mild acidity that provides a balanced finish. As someone who drinks coffee black, I found these medium roast pods offered just the right amount of depth without leaning too bitter or acidic.

[Check Victor Allen's Coffee 1 Single Serve Coffee Pods price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00slhkgvc/)  

**Ease of Use**

Brewing with their single-serve pods was a breeze. I tested these on my Keurig 2.0 brewer, and the compatibility was spot-on. All I had to do was load the pod, select the 8-ounce brew setting for the best taste (per their recommendation), and press brew. Within minutes, I had a fresh, hot cup ready to enjoy. I also appreciate the simple instructions on how to remove the pods post-brewing to minimize dripping—small details like that show thoughtfulness.

**Highlights**

- Convenient K-Cup pods for individual servings.
- Compatible with Keurig and most single-serve coffee brewers.
- Made from 100% Arabica coffee beans for a premium taste.
- Non-GMO, gluten-free, and certified Kosher, which adds to its appeal for those mindful of allergens or dietary restrictions.

**Packaging and Contents**

The box includes 80 single-serve pods, which is impressive for a product in this price range. While testing over several weeks, I found the pods consistently brewed the same quality of coffee with no duds or irregularities. The packaging itself is simple yet functional, ensuring the pods remain fresh while being practical to store. At 2.67 pounds, the box is manageable and fits nicely in my pantry.

**Favorable Aspects**

- The medium roast coffee is lively, aromatic, and perfect for everyday indulgence.
- Compatible with multiple brewing systems, providing versatility for consumers.
- The price-to-quality ratio stands out against competitors, offering great value.
- Beans sourced from South America maintain a high-end brew.

**Target Audience**

Anyone looking for a medium roast coffee with a focus on quality and convenience would find this product appealing. It’s ideal for busy professionals, students juggling hectic schedules, or even coffee purists who want something dependable without the complexities of manual brewing.

**Hurdles**

- The pods are not recyclable in all areas, making this less eco-friendly compared to some competitors.
- While the flavor is consistent, some coffee enthusiasts might find the medium roast lacking in boldness.
- Lacks flavor variety within the package, so if you're someone who enjoys rotating between flavors, that might be limiting.

**Direct Competitors**

In comparison to other players in the single-serve coffee game, like Green Mountain or Starbucks K-Cups, this product holds its ground well. Where others sometimes fall short on affordability, this coffee offers a significant bang for your buck without compromising on quality. Starbucks pods may provide more intense flavors, especially for darker roasts, while Green Mountain offers an extensive variety of flavors. However, Victor Allen's product edges ahead with consistent taste and a focus on simplicity.

**Financial Value**

Considering the bulk packaging, premium beans, and brewing ease, this product scores high on affordability. While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, its quality justifies the slightly higher investment. You’re essentially getting a café-quality cup at home without a hefty price tag attached.

1msqt9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnyThingUK/comments/1msqt9r/nuxe_crème_prodigieuse_eye_cream_review/,Nuxe Crème Prodigieuse Eye Cream Review,"I have a soft spot for **Nuxe**. They’re that French pharmacy brand I discovered when I was studying abroad in Paris (aka when I spent more time in Monoprix than in actual classes). And yes, their **Rêve de Miel Lip Balm** is still my forever holy grail. Five years and counting, and I still panic if I run out.

But this isn’t a love letter to lip balm, today’s review is all about their **Crème Prodigieuse Eye Cream**, which I’ve been testing out for a while now. Spoiler: it’s become the only eye cream I reach for, morning and night. Let’s get into it.

# The Basics

* **Product:** Nuxe Crème Prodigieuse Eye Cream
* **Size:** 15 ml (0.5 fl oz)

It’s marketed as a do-it-all: hydrates, brightens, calms puffiness, and gently tackles early signs of aging. Bonus points, it’s free from parabens, sulfates, alcohol, mineral oil, phthalates, GMOs… basically all the scary ingredient list villains.

# What’s Inside? (AKA Why It Works)

* **Hyaluronic Acid** → hydration hero, plumps things up
* **Caffeine** → de-puffs and wakes your eyes up (like coffee for your face)
* **Cocoa Extract** → antioxidant boost, plus it just *sounds* luxurious
* **Everlasting Blue (Immortelle)** → soothing, anti-aging vibes

Honestly, it feels like they built the formula specifically for those of us in our late 20s–30s who are like, “I don’t need Botox yet, but I also don’t want to look like I pulled three all-nighters in a row.”

# My Experience

So here’s the deal. My under-eyes are naturally… let’s say “moody.” Some days I wake up with shadows that look like I lost a fight with my pillow. Other days, it’s just puffiness that makes me look tired even after 8 hours of sleep.

Since I started using this cream:

* My eye area looks **hydrated and smoother** (no dry patches).
* **Dark circles look softer** not gone, let’s be real, but less zombie-ish.
* Puffiness calms down faster in the mornings (thank you caffeine).
* It layers really nicely under concealer without pilling or feeling greasy.

There was a legit moment where I caught myself in the mirror and thought, *“Wait, are my circles actually lighter? Or am I just squinting at good lighting?”*  Either way, it’s been a noticeable improvement.

# Pros & Cons

**What I Love:**

* Lightweight but still hydrating
* Works under makeup (big win for me)
* No weird smell, no stinging
* Actually makes a visible difference in puffiness/dark circles
* Clean-ish ingredient list

**What’s Meh:**

* If you have very deep hereditary dark circles, this won’t erase them (nothing will tbh)
* Price is a little higher than drugstore more “treat yourself” than “daily necessity”
* Results aren’t *instant,* it’s more of a gradual improvement

# Final Thoughts

If you’re in your late 20s or 30s and want an eye cream that does a bit of everything hydration, brightness, and a little anti-aging insurance, this is a really solid pick. It’s not magic in a tube, but it’s one of the few eye creams I’ve actually stuck with (and trust me, I’ve tried *so many*).",1,1755436968.0,AnyThingUK,0,1.0,False

Written by Brianna Wiest, bestselling author and queen of emotional clarity, this book doesn’t tiptoe around your excuses. It gets brutally honest about one thing: *you* are the mountain you must climb.

Nope, this isn’t a woo-woo self-help book with generic affirmations. Wiest breaks down the deep psychology of self-sabotage, and how it’s not a flaw but a protective mechanism gone rogue. This book isn’t just powerful - it’s transformative. Think therapy session meets spiritual smackdown. And yes, it made me cry mid-Subway ride.

## **Book Club Rating: 9.5/10**

## **Key Takeaways**

* **Self-sabotage isn’t laziness - it’s fear.** Every time you “accidentally” ghost an opportunity or quit right before something takes off, it’s your brain protecting you from unfamiliar success. Wild, right?
* **Emotions are data, not disruptions.** Anger, guilt, sadness - all of it is your subconscious trying to send a message. Learning to *listen* instead of numb out is how you heal.
* **Perfectionism is procrastination in a cuter outfit.** Waiting until you’re “ready” is how you delay your dreams. Progress starts when you’re okay with being messy.
* **Rock bottom is not failure.** It’s a signal that your old life no longer fits. The pain is just your transformation knocking.
* **Your future self is watching.** Ask: what would she do today? That’s your compass.

## **Quotes That Slapped**

* “Your new life is going to cost you your old one.”
* “Self-sabotage is just a misaligned survival instinct.”
* “You can’t hate yourself into someone you love.”
* “Resistance is a sign that healing is trying to happen.”

As someone who’s blown up good things just because they felt too good? This book was a mirror I didn’t ask for - but needed. It reminded me that healing is uncomfortable but staying stuck is worse.

If you’ve been stuck in your own loop, or constantly feel like “I know better, so why don’t I *do* better?” - read this. It’s for high-functioning people with low-key chaos inside.

After trying it out for a few weeks, brewing coffee for myself and offering cups to guests, I feel like I’ve gotten to know this little machine inside and out. There’s no denying its sleek gray design blends nicely with modern kitchen aesthetics, but beyond looks, the question I wanted to answer was: does it actually deliver the coffee experience it promises? Spoiler: It mostly does, but there were a couple of moments that made me pause.

**Design That Melds Practicality With Style**

What first caught my eye was how compact and tidy this coffee maker is. With dimensions of 7.05 inches deep, 17.91 inches wide, and 14.41 inches high, it doesn’t eat up my precious counter space. Despite its compactness, it still manages to house a 1.95 L dual-position reservoir. It’s easy to remove and refill, giving the machine a practical edge for daily use. I ended up setting the tank to the back position to squeeze it into a corner near the toaster. The matte plastic finish feels sturdy enough and yet lightweight, making it approachable for even non-techie users.

**The Key Benefits**

- MultiStream Technology ensures that every K-Cup pod I used was fully saturated for consistent flavor, and that’s genuinely noticeable with each cup.
- Customizable settings allow brewing from 6 to 12-ounce sizes, lending flexibility based on my caffeine needs or, when guests are over, their varied preferences.  
- The Strong button is an absolute lifesaver; I’m not a weak coffee drinker, and this added intensity was perfect.

**Performance: From Heated Water to Perfect Brew**

This coffee maker earns major points for quick brewing. Mornings in my household can get chaotic, so having a machine that delivers hot coffee in just a few minutes feels essential. Interestingly, it handles iced coffee well too. Brewing hot over ice doesn’t dilute the flavor as much as I feared it might. The MultiStream Technology genuinely plays a role in extracting fuller-bodied flavors, something I noticed even with more affordable K-Cups. 

That said, I also tested it with ground coffee using the My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter, which is sold separately. It worked fine, but I did need to fiddle a bit to get the grind level just right—too coarse, and the water ran through too quickly; too fine, and it clogged slightly.

**Disadvantages**

- The unit weight, at 5.9 pounds, makes it less portable than I initially anticipated for taking on trips.
- Doesn’t come with the reusable filter, forcing an additional purchase if you want that extra bit of flexibility.  
- The buttons, while straightforward, aren’t as intuitive as touchscreen models, adding a slight learning curve.

**Versatility for Every Coffee Lover**

No matter your coffee mood—strong brews, iced versions, or quick 6-ounce single shots—this gadget manages it all. Even the larger, travel-mug-friendly cup sizes are easy to brew, which came in handy during those early-morning rushes out of the house. The reservoir holds plenty of water, which means fewer refills, and it bothers me less than my previous single-serve brewer that always seemed thirsty.

Gifted this to a friend recently for their office and received rave reviews in return. They like that the machine is quiet compared to the previous model they had, and the removable reservoir spared them from awkward desk refills.

**Rival Brands**

Comparing the Keurig K-Supreme to other single-serve brewers like the Nespresso Vertuo Next shows some differences. While the Nespresso might edge out in terms of sheer premium feel and deeper crema layers, it lacks compatibility with every pod type—something the Keurig does better. On the other hand, budget-friendly machines like Hamilton Beach FlexBrew offer dual brewing but miss out on advanced tech like Keurig's MultiStream feature. For someone wanting flexibility without the bounds of proprietary pods, Keurig easily wins. 

**True Value**

At its mid-range price point, it competes well with similarly priced single-serve coffee makers. For the features it offers—like MultiStream Technology, strong brew customization, and refillable tank convenience—it feels like a balanced investment. While you could find cheaper machines, most don’t extract coffee grounds this efficiently, and the inclusion of multiple-brew sizes adds value someone low-cost options lack.

When I started keto, I weighed 316 pounds and I got really into it, I weigh all of my food to the gram kind of gamify it.  I went from 316 to 190, when I started, I couldn’t eat eggs without toast or some kind of bread, It was just one of those things and when I had coffee, I would drink it with a pint of cream and 16 tablespoons of sugar and that’s only slightly exaggerating, my coffee tasted like hot coffee ice cream.  

Eventually, I got to the point where now all I drink is black coffee and I know put cream in it. It’s good. It’s extra fat, but I’ve kind of learned to enjoy just black coffee took me about three months to really get into it. Of course, then I started adding butter to it and a little bit of coconut oil , but that’s basically like putting cream in it so it works for me.  

After I got down to 190 I thought I’ve got this. I don’t need to do keto anymore and I put about 45 pounds because I just can’t be fucking trusted with carbs lol.  I’ve been back on keto for about four weeks kicking butt have my favorite snack snacks, which are Lindt chocolate bars and for a treat I’ll have one square of a lit dark chocolate bar and that’s plenty and I’ll eat like one or 2 ounces of fruit today just for something sweet that’s you know a good cleanser for my pallet  

Someday, maybe I’ll post before and after pictures, but I don’t have that many pictures of me when I was the size of a blue whale for obvious reasons I did not enjoy pictures, the reason I got on keto was I saw a picture of a friend who passed away from her disease and an event, and I looked at the picture and a man. He was just huge and he was hugging someone you couldn’t see the person‘s face and I asked somebody who’s angel with and they’re like dude that’s you, I was literally just as big as he was and that’s the day that I went on keto. After laughing at my friends were doing it and being like don’t be stupid and blah blah blah I called up one of my friends we were talking and I started getting some keto pointers and I went cold turkey on carbs and even now you know between five and 10 carbs a day is really where I’m at.

Yesterday I posted about waking up at 5am to meditate and journal. Got 200 likes and three comments about “discipline.”

The truth is I woke up at 5am because my neighbor’s dog was barking and I couldn’t get back to sleep. I sat on my couch in yesterday’s clothes, scrolled Twitter for an hour watching people argue about things that don’t matter, and ate cereal while my reflection in my black laptop screen looked disappointed in me.

But “Productive Morning Routine” gets more engagement than “I Feel Lost Most Days.”

The performance trap

I think we broke something when we turned our lives into content.

My friend Sarah posted a photo of her “gratitude journal” last week. Beautiful handwriting, perfect lighting, inspirational quote about manifesting abundance. The post got 500 likes and comments calling her “inspiring.”

Three days later she called me crying because she got rejected from another job interview and doesn’t know how she’s going to pay rent next month. She’s been unemployed for eight months and her savings are gone.

Which version of Sarah is real? Both. But only one gets posted. Only one gets rewarded with hearts and fire emojis.

The posts that actually make me stop scrolling

“I just googled ‘how to know if you’re depressed’ at 2pm on a Tuesday while sitting in my office.”

“My 12-year-old asked me what I do at work and I realized I have no idea how to explain my job in a way that matters.”

“I’ve been successful by every metric my parents cared about and I still feel empty most of the time.”

“The skills I spent twenty years of my life developing no longer interest me and I need more meaning in life than work. Now what?”

These aren’t content strategies. They’re not optimized for engagement. They’re just people being people in public for a moment.

The moment I stopped trying to be an expert

Last month I spent three hours crafting a post about “authentic leadership in the digital age.” I researched statistics, generated the perfect AI image, wrote three drafts with different hooks. Bullet points, frameworks, a clear call-to-action asking people to share their leadership challenges.

It got 47 likes and two generic comments.

Then, at 11pm on a Wednesday, I posted without thinking: “Does anyone else feel like they’re just cosplaying as an adult and hoping nobody notices?”

2,847 responses in 24 hours. People sharing their own moments of feeling completely lost. CEOs admitting they Google basic business terms before board meetings. Parents confessing they have no idea what they’re doing and their kids seem more mature than them. A surgeon saying he still feels like he’s pretending to know what he’s doing in the OR sometimes.

The difference? I wasn’t trying to teach anyone anything. I wasn’t positioning myself as someone with answers. I was just trying to breathe through the feeling of being a fraud in my own life.

What actually happens when you tell the truth online

Some people get uncomfortable. They want you to go back to the highlight reel. They unfollow because your mess is making them think about their own mess and they came here for inspiration, not reality.

Some people get relieved. Finally, someone said what they were thinking but were too afraid to admit. They DM you saying “I thought I was the only one.”

Some people try to fix you. They send you articles about gratitude and links to productivity systems and book recommendations that changed their lives. They mean well but they’re missing the point.

Most people just keep scrolling. Because the truth is harder to consume than inspiration porn. It doesn’t make them feel better about themselves. It makes them feel… something. And feeling something is uncomfortable when you’re just trying to zone out.

But the people who stop? They really stop. They see you. Not your brand or your morning routine or your seven-figure business or your perfect family photos. They see the person behind the performance.

The economics of authenticity

Here’s what nobody talks about: being real online is bad for business, until it isn’t.

I lost followers when I started posting about struggling with anxiety. Brands stopped reaching out for partnerships. My engagement dropped because vulnerable posts don’t get shared as much as motivational quotes.

But the clients who did reach out were different. They hired me not because I seemed successful, but because I seemed human. They trusted me with their actual problems instead of their marketing problems.

Revenue went down for six months. Then it went way up, with better clients who paid better rates for work that actually mattered.

The difference? I stopped trying to appeal to everyone and started connecting with the right people. There are billions of people in the world. The goal is not to appeal to all of them.

I’m tired of the performance

I’m tired of pretending my life is a case study in optimization.

I’m tired of turning every struggle into a “lesson learned” with three key takeaways.

I’m tired of ending every vulnerable post with “What’s your experience with this?” as if pain needs to be productive.

I’m tired of the pressure to have figured something out before I’m allowed to talk about it.

Sometimes there is no lesson. Sometimes you’re just sad or confused or angry and that’s it. Sometimes the point isn’t growth or engagement or building your personal brand. Sometimes the point is just being honest about what it’s like to be alive right now, in this moment, with these feelings.

My actual morning routine (unoptimized version)

Wake up tired because I stayed up too late scrolling. Check my phone immediately even though I know it’s terrible for my mental health and I’ve read twelve articles about digital wellness.

Lie in bed for 15 minutes thinking about all the things I should be doing instead of lying in bed. Make a mental list of tasks that immediately overwhelms me.

Make coffee. Stare out the window at the same view I see every day and wonder if this is what I thought being a grown-up would feel like.

Sometimes I meditate for five minutes. Usually I don’t because I “don’t have time” even though I just spent 20 minutes looking at TikToks.

Sometimes I write in my journal. Usually I just worry about things I can’t control while drinking coffee that’s too strong.

Sometimes I feel grateful for my life. Usually I feel behind some imaginary timeline I created for myself years ago.

That’s it. That’s the routine. It’s not morning magic. It doesn’t unlock unlimited potential. It’s just what happens when a regular person tries to start their day without falling apart.

What makes people feel seen

The performance trap isn’t just exhausting — it’s lonely. All that polishing and positioning keeps people at arm’s length. But the truth? The moments that connect most aren’t the ones we perfect. They’re the ones we almost don’t post because they feel too raw.

If you want to make people feel seen instead of sold to, stop trying to make “content.” Say something true. Even if it’s small. Even if it’s inconvenient. Even if it makes you look like you don’t have it all figured out — because none of us do.

The world has enough thought leaders telling us how to optimize our lives. What we need are truth tellers willing to say, “I don’t know. I’m struggling. This isn’t working for me either.” We need permission to be messy, uncertain, and still figuring it out — because that’s all of us anyway.

That’s the heartbeat of QuestionClass: not collecting answers, but living in the questions. When I share a question, it’s not to prove I know the answer, but to invite someone else to wonder with me.

That’s the difference between performance and connection — curiosity doesn’t have a script.

Posted from my couch at 11:47pm because I couldn’t sleep and kept thinking about this. No content calendar. No strategy meeting. No SEO optimization. Just thoughts that wouldn’t leave me alone until I wrote them down.

Tomorrow I’ll probably post something about productivity tips because the mortgage is due and vulnerable posts don’t pay bills. But tonight, this felt more important than being smart.

## Key Features Analysis

The U Line ice maker boasts several advanced features that contribute to its superior performance and user satisfaction.

**Clear Ice Technology:** U Line's clear ice technology ensures the production of crystal-clear, virtually odorless, and tasteless ice cubes. This is achieved through a unique freezing process that removes impurities, resulting in ice that melts slower and enhances the flavor of beverages.

The clear ice technology uses a vertical evaporator that freezes water layer by layer, allowing impurities to settle out and be flushed away. This process results in ice that is significantly clearer and denser than standard ice, providing a premium ice experience. The system is designed to minimize air bubbles and mineral content, leading to exceptional ice quality.

**Digital Touchpad Control:** The digital touchpad control offers precise temperature management and allows users to easily adjust ice production settings. This intuitive interface provides real-time feedback on the unit's performance and allows for customized ice production based on specific needs.

The digital touchpad features a clear, easy-to-read display that shows the current temperature, ice production level, and any error messages. Users can adjust the ice thickness, set a timer for ice production, and even activate a cleaning cycle with just a few touches. The control panel is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring effortless operation.

**Built-In Pump:** Select U Line models feature a built-in drain pump, providing flexible installation options. This eliminates the need for a gravity drain, allowing the unit to be placed in locations where a traditional drain line is not readily available.

The built-in pump automatically removes melted ice water from the unit, ensuring continuous operation without manual draining. This feature is particularly useful in basements, home bars, or other areas where plumbing is limited. The pump is designed to be quiet and efficient, minimizing noise and energy consumption.

**Energy-Efficient Operation:** U Line ice makers are engineered for energy efficiency, minimizing power consumption without compromising ice production. These units are designed to meet or exceed industry standards for energy efficiency, helping to reduce operating costs and environmental impact.

U Line utilizes advanced insulation materials and efficient cooling systems to minimize energy waste. The units are designed to cycle on and off as needed, rather than running continuously, further reducing energy consumption. Many models are Energy Star certified, ensuring optimal energy performance.

Key features of the U Line ice maker include:
  * Clear ice technology
  * Digital touchpad control
  * Built-in pump (select models)
  * Energy-efficient operation

Let me paint a very caffeinated picture for you because, just like you, I depend on coffee as the lifeblood of my mornings. With its burr grinder and thermal carafe setup, this coffeemaker claims to merge convenience and flavor improvement in one piece of machinery. And yes, I’ve spent more mornings with this coffee maker than I can count at this point.  

**Design and Build**  
""Solid and practical"" are the first things that come to mind. This machine is a bit of a chunker—it measures 10.75 by 14.25 by 19.25 inches, taking up more counter space than some others I’ve seen. That said, the black and silver color scheme gives it a clean aesthetic that blends well with most modern kitchens. It features a comfort-grip handle on the thermal carafe, which seems small but is a game-changer, especially during groggy mornings when everything, including my coordination, is questionable. However, the weight of the unit at over 16 pounds means this is not exactly ""easy to carry around"" if you rearrange your kitchen often.  

**Features and Operation**  
Hands down, one of this coffee maker’s standout features is its built-in professional-style burr grinder. The machine takes both whole beans and pre-ground coffee, catering to everyone’s preferences (or caffeine emergencies). I’ve clicked through its flavor strength options—regular, bold, and extra bold—and tested them one by one. Extra bold? A certified slap to the face in the best way possible for those mornings when nothing else gets you moving. The grind control also lets you customize the cup output—4 to 10 cups—which means less waste for someone like me who doesn’t always power through a whole pot.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Professional-style burr grinder ensures consistent grind and better flavor extraction.  
- Half-pound bean hopper with a sealed lid keeps beans fresh longer.  
- Thermal carafe maintains coffee temperature without needing a warming plate.  
- Intuitive 24-hour programmability and Brew Pause feature let you grab a quick pour before it's done brewing.  

[Ready to buy Cuisinart DGB-850? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://sohdu.com/p/b07ymv2zbd/)  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
What truly got my attention was the flavor consistency, thanks to that burr grinder. Unlike blade grinders, this one creates uniform coffee grounds that ultimately make a big difference in taste. Brew strength is highly customizable, and even when testing cheaper beans, I could taste the maximized flavor. The thermal carafe? It delivers piping hot coffee for hours—I’ve come back hours later to surprisingly decent warmth. However, the machine isn’t whisper-quiet; the grinder is a bit loud, which might irritate light-sleepers in the house.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The grinder can be quite noisy during operation, particularly if you’re using it first thing in the morning.  
- At 16 pounds, its hefty build makes it less versatile if you often rearrange your kitchen setup.  
- The large LCD display isn't backlit, which might make it hard to read in dimly lit environments (hello, 5 am struggles).  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this machine to similar coffee makers, like the Breville Grind Control Coffee Maker, it’s clear that you trade a bit of compact design for user-friendly details. The Breville model is lighter and less noisy, but it lacks the thermal carafe's heat retention quality that Cuisinart offers. Other budget-friendly machines like the Hamilton Beach Grind-and-Brew boast affordability but fail to deliver the same quality grind or thermal efficiency. This Cuisinart option finds itself in the middle ground—refined performance without the sky-high price of premium machines like Technivorm.  

**Cost-Efficiency**  
Here’s the kicker: do you get what you pay for? With features like a burr grinder, thermal carafe, and programmable options, this coffee maker justifies its price range. Similar models with these same perks trend pricier. While it isn’t budget-tier, the ability to brew top-notch coffee with control over grind and strength makes it a weighty—but worthy—investment in the pursuit of caffeination.

1msqbq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1msqbq0/explore_why_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Explore Why the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Express is Worth It,"Testing out the Keurig K-Cup has been a bit of a delightful adventure for me, especially as someone who cannot function without coffee in the mornings. This single-serve coffee maker gets to the heart of convenience more than most devices I’ve tried in the kitchen.

**Compact Design for Small Spaces**  
Living in a small apartment means I’ve had to become very picky about appliances and their footprint. The Keurig K-Cup fits right in without taking up much counter space—it’s only 6.5 inches wide. I appreciated how its modern, black finish blended well with my minimalistic kitchen decor. The aesthetic isn’t over-the-top, and it doesn’t scream for attention in my kitchen, which is a plus. Despite its compact size, it accommodates travel mugs up to 7 inches tall, so I never feel like I have to sacrifice my bigger mugs for convenience.

**Simple Button Controls**  
You know those mornings when you’re just not awake enough to fiddle with complicated settings? That’s where this coffee maker shines. With only a couple of button presses, you’re on your way to a fresh cup of coffee. I couldn’t help but notice how foolproof the process is—even my guest, who routinely struggles with kitchen gadgets, operated this machine without a hitch.

[Check Keurig K-Cup price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b0bn9srqt9/)

**Multiple Brewing Sizes and Reservoir Convenience**  
What stood out to me was the option to choose between three cup sizes—6, 8, or 10 ounces. Depending on how desperate I was for caffeine, I could switch up the serving size. The 36-ounce removable water reservoir made life easier too, sparing me from constantly refilling it. I got about four cups out of this before needing to top it off, which worked well when friends dropped by for coffee. Plus, you can back-to-back brew without waiting for the machine to reheat—a big win for impatient drinkers like me.

**Speed and Freshness**  
It’s true when Keurig claims it brews fast and fresh coffee. I was surprised by how quickly it turned a pod into a steaming mug of happiness. Fresh, hot coffee in minutes—not even enough time to scroll through Instagram. That’s productivity right there.

**Boons**  
- Fits easily into small spaces.  
- Effortless to use, even for gadget rookies.  
- Supports various cup sizes and travel mugs.  
- Consistently fast brewing of fresh coffee.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- The 36-ounce reservoir might feel small for heavy coffee drinkers.  
- It's a bit noisy while brewing, though not enough to be a major issue.  
- While it’s compatible with reusable pods, purchasing them separately adds to the cost.  

**Maintenance Alerts and Auto Off Feature**  
Convenience doesn’t stop after brewing. The coffee maker lets you know when it’s time to descale after every 250 brews. If you’re like me and tend to forget cleaning schedules, this feature is extremely helpful. Another little gem is the Auto Off mode, which powers down the brewer after five minutes of inactivity. Not only does this save energy, but it also calms the worries of someone who’s perpetually rushing out the door.

**Product Comparisons**  
Compared to other single-serve coffee makers like the Nespresso Vertuo, the Keurig K-Cup strikes a great balance between affordability and functionality. The Vertuo is slightly faster and offers a wider range of pod flavors, but it’s bulkier and comes with a heftier price tag. If you’re someone who values a sleek and compact machine that simply gets the job done without too many extras, this Keurig model hits the sweet spot.

On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew offers dual brewing for single-serve pods and a full pot of coffee. It’s fantastic if you’re brewing for multiple people regularly. However, the FlexBrew isn’t as compact, and the brewing process takes slightly longer, making the Keurig a better choice for speed and small counter spaces.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Given its features and performance, I’d say the price point is justified. It won’t break the bank, but you’re still getting a premium-level experience suited for everyday use. For anyone prioritizing fast coffee with minimal mess, this coffee maker feels like a worthy investment. The fact that it’s compatible with hundreds of K-Cup flavors, teas, and hot cocoa options adds to the value. It’s easy on the wallet and checks all the boxes for functionality.

1msqbm9,https://i.redd.it/r8mini0jvkjf1.jpeg,A coffee that taste just like a muskmelon.,"A friend brought a bag of Colombian Caturra beans from OSAR Coffee Roasters (Madinah, KSA), and it’s called “Shamam”. The name means musk melon and honestly, that’s exactly what it tastes like.

The smell when we opened the bag was pure melon, and brewing it on a V60 gave this super sweet, fruity cup that was unlike anything I’ve had before. One of the most surprising coffees I’ve tried, taste just like muskmelon.

The label mentions that the beans are actually infused in muskmelon and watermelon juice.

Process: Natural Anaerobic

Infused with: Muskmelon & Watermelon

*Caturra is actually a natural mutation of the Bourbon variety of Arabica. It’s known for its compact plants, high yields, and usually a balanced, sweet cup with some citrusy acidity. (Google result)

Here’s how you can stay focused and committed to your goals until you reach them.

# 1. Set Realistic and Achievable Goals

One of the main reasons people quit is because they set goals that are either too vague or too ambitious. Instead of saying, *“*[I want to lose weight,](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/un4p2g/what_actually_helped_you_lose_weight/)*”* set measurable goals like *“I want to lose 10 pounds in 2 months.”* Smaller, achievable milestones give you a sense of accomplishment and keep your motivation high. As you achieve these smaller goals, you’ll feel encouraged to keep going.

# 2. Focus on Progress, Not Perfection

Perfection is the enemy of consistency. If you expect yourself to follow a strict diet or exercise plan 100% of the time, you’re more likely to quit after a small slip. Instead, celebrate progress—even small steps like walking more than usual, choosing a healthy meal, or drinking more water. Remember, consistency matters more than perfection when it comes to long-term weight management.

# 3. Find a Source of Accountability

Having someone to hold you accountable can make a world of difference. This could be a workout buddy, a supportive friend, or even an online community where people share their [fitness journeys](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/fla1ka/heres_a_timeline_of_my_fitness_journey/). When you know someone is checking in on your progress, you’ll be more likely to stick to your routine. You can also track your own progress with apps, journals, or weekly check-ins to stay focused.

# 4. Make Healthy Choices Convenient

Motivation becomes easier when healthy choices are also the most convenient ones. Keep nutritious snacks handy, prepare your meals in advance, and create a workout schedule that fits your lifestyle. If your gym is far away, consider home workouts or daily walks. When you reduce barriers to making healthy decisions, you rely less on willpower and more on routine.

# 5. Reward Yourself Along the Way

Rewards can be powerful motivators. Treat yourself when you reach milestones—buy new workout clothes, enjoy a spa day, or do something fun you’ve been putting off. The key is to make sure your rewards don’t undo your progress (for example, avoid using junk food as a “reward” for eating well). Instead, choose things that boost your confidence and reinforce your new lifestyle.

# 6. Visualize Your Success

Visualization is a technique used by [athletes](https://www.forbes.com/lists/athletes/), entrepreneurs, and successful individuals in all fields. Picture yourself reaching your weight loss goal. Imagine how you’ll feel, how you’ll look, and the confidence you’ll carry. This mental practice creates a positive emotional connection with your goal, helping you push through difficult moments when your motivation dips.

# 7. Use Tools and Products That Support Your Journey

Sometimes, staying motivated is easier when you use tools that simplify your efforts. For example, some people add the **java burn coffee supplement** to their morning routine because it blends with their daily habits and supports their health goals. Similarly, convenient options like **Java Burn Packets** can make it easier to stay consistent since they are pre-portioned and easy to use. While no single product is a magic solution, integrating helpful tools into your plan can keep you on track and motivated.

# 8. Focus on Non-Scale Victories

The scale isn’t the only measure of success. Pay attention to other positive changes—like increased energy, better sleep, improved strength, or looser clothes. These non-scale victories remind you that progress is happening even if the numbers move slowly. By celebrating these wins, you’ll stay encouraged to continue your journey.

# 9. Overcome Plateaus With Variety

Almost everyone hits a plateau during weight loss, where the progress slows down. Instead of feeling discouraged, use this as a chance to change things up. Try a new workout routine, adjust your meal plan, or explore new activities like hiking, dancing, or yoga. Adding variety not only helps break plateaus but also keeps your routine exciting, which makes it easier to stay motivated.

# 10. Keep Your “Why” in Mind

Every journey starts with a reason—whether it’s improving health, feeling more confident, or having more energy for daily life. Write down your “why” and revisit it often. When motivation dips, reminding yourself of the bigger purpose behind your journey can reignite your determination.

# Final Thoughts

Motivation isn’t a constant—it comes and goes. That’s why building habits, finding accountability, and celebrating progress are so important. Staying motivated on your weight loss journey requires patience, consistency, and a mindset that embraces progress over perfection. By setting realistic goals, rewarding yourself, and using helpful tools like [**java burn coffee supplement**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ogmruskdia/comments/1mo4vdt/java_burn_coffee_complete_review_ingredients/) or convenient [Java Burn Packets](https://community.thermaltake.com/index.php?/topic/646307-java-burn-reviews-buying-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-java-burn-coffee-for-safe-effective-fate-burn/), you can maintain the drive you need to reach your goals.

This dude is straight up a pest!  Tall, skinny, gay and homeless white dude.  I've seen him smoking crack on more than 1 occasion, he buys it right under the HJB bridge. The guy has scabs all over his body and is always pretty dirty.  He's been bothering me for a couple of months now.  The pictures are from a few weeks ago, when I originally wanted to post about him, but he disappeared for a bit, so I figured he was in jail or something, but he's back!

Frequently, he will approach me with a 'What's up buddy?' and I ignore him.  I usually wear my headphones to prevent small talk with people I don't really care to talk to.  He sits down next to me, didn't even ask if it's alright.  The guy starts talking to me about whatever and it always leads to him saying that he's sexually attracted to me.  As soon as he said that, I get up to leave.  He follows me and BEGs to suck my dick, he even offered to 'pay' me $500 for it (he's got no money!).  I tell him to leave me alone, I don't get down like that, but he persists in his pursuit.

As I'm walking away, he dips into the handicap portable toilet and tells me to come in with him.  That's going to be a fuck no from me!  I began to ignore him and walk quicker to get the hell out of there.  I get about 50' away from him and he yell to me 'I really need some coffee, can I have a sip of yours?'  What the fuck is that!?  At that point, I yell at him to leave me the fuck alone!  He put his head down in shame and appeared to give up on his pursuit.

Has anyone else had a similar occurrence happen with this guy?  I can't be the only one, right?  Im not even that good looking, I'd hate to see how he acts with a total STUD around.

Everything around me reminds me of you- whenever I open my eyes and you're not there, whenever I prepare my coffee just how you like it, whenever I hear my phone ring and receive notifications, I wish it was you. I remember you when I prepare for work because for two years, whenever I moisturize and do my skincare, we'd be facetiming. I remember you whenever I go for lunch because you always send me reminders during lunch time. 

It's been hard. So hard. You've been a part of my life for the past two years and when routine suddenly comes to a halt, it is like me going for scuba diving and then suddenly, my tank stopped working. It's hard to eat. I force myself to have a least a decent meal once a day cause I don't want to be sick. It's very difficult to sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night and end up crying cause I remember how happy we were. How carefree we were, until we have to give up on each other because of consequences and choices that was both imposed to us. 

How do I say goodbye and let go of the man who has been my anchor, my home, my happy place? It was different with you. I've been alone for 5 yrs and when you came, everything became beautiful. You took care of me, treasured me, loved me. IDK how to live my life without you. 

I wonder how are you doing. Do you eat on time? Do you drink enough water for the day? Do you miss me? Do you miss the way I send my good morning love messages everyday? Do you think of me in random timings of the day and wish it was me you've chosen? Do you feel pain in your heart when you realize you've lost me? 

You told me that you were the happiest while you were with me, that I am your happy place too.

1msq73j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ogmruskdia/comments/1msq73j/why_resistance_training_is_key_to_longterm_fat/,Why Resistance Training is Key to Long-Term Fat Loss,"When most people think about losing weight, they immediately picture endless hours of running on a treadmill or cycling through high-intensity cardio sessions. While cardio certainly has its place in a fitness routine, it’s not the only — or even the most effective — path to [sustainable fat loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/17820j4/advice_on_what_sustainable_weight_loss_habits_are/). One of the most overlooked yet powerful strategies for long-term fat reduction is **resistance training**.

Whether you are lifting weights, using resistance bands, or practicing bodyweight exercises, resistance training builds lean muscle, boosts metabolism, and creates a foundation for long-lasting results. Let’s break down why this form of exercise should be at the center of any fat loss strategy.

1. Resistance Training Boosts Metabolism

One of the biggest challenges with fat loss is keeping your metabolism active. Many people start with extreme calorie-cutting diets and endless cardio, only to experience a slowdown in their metabolic rate. This makes it harder to burn calories and leads to plateaus.

Resistance training solves this problem by building lean muscle tissue. Muscle is metabolically active, meaning it burns more calories at rest than fat. Even when you’re sitting on the couch or sleeping, your body will be burning more energy if you have more muscle mass. This long-term metabolic boost is one of the reasons resistance training is far more effective for fat loss than cardio alone.

# 2. Prevents Muscle Loss During Weight Reduction

When you’re in a calorie deficit, your body doesn’t just burn fat — it can also break down muscle tissue for energy. This is problematic because losing muscle slows your metabolism and makes it harder to keep the weight off.

Resistance training acts as a signal to the body: “Hold on to this muscle, we need it.” By regularly engaging in strength workouts, you can preserve muscle while shedding fat. This ensures that most of your weight loss comes from fat, not lean tissue, making your results more sustainable in the long run.

# 3. Long-Term Fat Loss vs. Short-Term Results

It’s important to distinguish between losing weight quickly and keeping it off for good. Cardio-heavy routines may cause fast drops in scale weight, but those results often come from water weight and muscle loss. That’s why many people who lose weight with cardio-only plans struggle to maintain their results.

Resistance training creates a different pathway. By building muscle and increasing strength, your body composition improves. You may weigh the same or only slightly less, but your body fat percentage drops and your shape changes in a healthy way. This is why two people can weigh the same but look completely different — muscle creates a leaner, firmer, and healthier body.

# 4. Enhances Everyday Functionality

Resistance training isn’t just about aesthetics; it also makes daily life easier. Stronger muscles improve posture, support joint health, and reduce the risk of injury. Activities like climbing stairs, carrying groceries, or even playing with your kids become much easier when your muscles are conditioned.

This improvement in functional fitness is another reason why people who adopt resistance training as part of their lifestyle are more likely to stick with it. Instead of exercising only for short-term weight loss, you’re training for a stronger and more capable life.

# 5. Combines Well With Nutrition & Smart Choices

Exercise alone can’t deliver long-term fat loss — nutrition plays an equally important role. Many people pair their resistance training programs with high-protein meals to support muscle recovery and fat burning. This combination ensures you’re fueling your body with the right nutrients while encouraging fat loss.

Some individuals also explore natural boosters to complement their healthy lifestyle. For example, many fitness enthusiasts use the [java burn coffee supplement](https://www.reddit.com/r/ogmruskdia/comments/1mo4vdt/java_burn_coffee_complete_review_ingredients/) as part of their morning routine to support energy and metabolism. While no product is a magic solution, pairing tools like [Java Burn Packets](https://community.thermaltake.com/index.php?/topic/646307-java-burn-reviews-buying-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-java-burn-coffee-for-safe-effective-fate-burn/) with resistance training and a balanced diet can help create a holistic fat loss approach.

# 6. Builds Mental Resilience and Consistency

Sustainable fat loss isn’t just physical — it’s mental. Resistance training encourages goal setting, tracking progress, and pushing through challenges. Every time you lift heavier weights or complete an extra set, you build confidence and discipline.

This mental toughness often carries into other areas of life, including nutrition and lifestyle habits. When you’re stronger in the gym, you’re more likely to make healthier food choices and stay consistent with your fat loss goals.

# 7. Resistance Training is Flexible and Adaptable

Another reason resistance training is so effective for fat loss is its adaptability. You don’t need an expensive gym membership or professional equipment. Bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, and planks can be done anywhere. Resistance bands are affordable and portable. For those who prefer gyms, free weights and machines provide endless variety.

Because you can tailor resistance training to your level, age, and goals, it’s an exercise form that grows with you. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced lifter, there’s always a way to challenge yourself and keep progressing.

# Final Thoughts

When it comes to long-term fat loss, resistance training stands out as one of the most powerful tools available. Unlike cardio, which [burns calories](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1cncfqa/which_exercise_burns_the_most_calories_conversely/) only during the workout, resistance training creates lasting metabolic benefits through muscle growth. It protects lean tissue, supports daily functionality, enhances mental resilience, and pairs seamlessly with good nutrition.

If your goal is to not just lose fat but also to keep it off while building a healthier and stronger body, resistance training should be the foundation of your fitness plan. Combine it with smart dietary choices, enough rest, and consistent effort, and you’ll discover that sustainable fat loss is not just possible — it’s achievable.",1,1755435353.0,ogmruskdia,0,1.0,False

Historical Mystery /Comedy 

Through the curved glass windows of the schooner’s small but elegant stern gallery, our wake stretches over a vast expanse sparkling blue sea. I should be making entries in the log, but the splendid sunset keeps drawing my attention from its pages. 

Then I see the French Frigate, the Pellier, swing into view as she yaws half a mile off our quarter. The sudden turn points her broadside at our stern, all twenty-four of her gun ports open wide. 

So, they would try their range again. 

My mind loses all meditative expression, and in disappointment I reach for my coffee as the Pellier’s side vanishes behind a cloud of orange-punched smoke. A moment later comes the thundering crash of her guns, white plumes dotting across our wake where her roundshot strikes the sea, just short of our fleeing schooner. 

One lucky shot bounces off the waves and comes aboard, smashing the cabin windows and shattering the coffee cup in my hand. 

“Miss Dangerfield,” I say, in a voice calculated to penetrate the entire vessel. 

“Sir?” Says my steward, her concerned face appearing at the cabin door. Her eyes immediately fall on the rustled tablecloth and askew silver dishes, and her expression turns somewhat accusatory. 

As if I’d personally invited an 18-pound ball aboard at one thousand feet per second. 

“Another cup if you please, ma’am, thank you,” I say, as politely as I can manage. 

She salutes sullenly…sarcastically? No, no, she wouldn’t dare, and vanishes into the galley. 

We’d have never allowed these insolent looks in the Navy, I reflect. For a moment I imagine her bare back strapped to the grating, taking half a dozen stripes for insubordination. 

But I’m no longer part of the Royal Fleet; I’m a smuggler, and the rules are different now. As captain and part-owner of the schooner, I maintain the same rigid authority, but the crew are volunteers and professional seamen, much less concerned with formalities than your by-the-book man-o-war crews. 

The coffee comes back hot and strong. I drink a few grateful gulps, then fill my cup—a metal cup, I notice—and head up on deck. I note with satisfaction that the Frigate had continued to wear and was now pointing away south. 

Mr Blythe turns away from the taffrail when I approach, and scurries over to me. He’s an odd, squirrelly fellow we picked up in Port Mahon, said he needed a quiet passage, no papers. Adding in the fact that he’s a Spaniard, speaks Latin, and wears all black; he might as well have the word “Assassin” tattooed on his forehead. 

He makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable.  

I open my telescope and pretend to focus on a flock of seagulls off our starboard beam, hoping he’ll turn away. 

“Expecting more trouble, Captain?” 

“Not presently,” I say, “still - I better go have a look from the masthead.” 

Slinging my telescope, I spring onto the rigging and scramble aloft like a seasoned foremast hand. 

The platform at the topmast is crowded: three sailors. The lookout and two off-duty hands, seated on folded piles of sailcloth. I hear the clatter of dice, and a moment later one scoops them into his mouth.  

All wear guilty expressions; they weren’t expecting anyone, much less the captain, and even smuggling ships have rules against gambling. 

But I’m no longer in the mood to flog anyone, and regardless all attention shifts at cries from the deck below: 

“What’s that lubber doing? He’ll kill himself!”

“He’ll break his neck, damn fool!” 

Glancing over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled the rigging. He’d tried to follow me up, the pragmatical bastard! He slips again and hangs inverted, swinging by his ankles with the roll of the mast. His face shows pure horror. 

Fortunately Miss Dangerfield chose that moment to ascend the opposite rigging with my refreshments, making the climb look easy despite being encumbered by a steaming kettle and silver cigar case. 

She hangs these on a rat line, and leaps for a backstay, swinging across the mast to the rigging with it’s precarious hold on the assassin. Seizing him by the ankle, she jerks him free and upright and carries him the rest of the way aloft, dumping him in a gasping heap on our platform. 

“Sir!” Says the lookout, pointing to the French ship which was now almost disappearing from view, “they’re flying an alphabetical message.” 

I focus the eyepiece of my telescope, and the Pelliere springs into view. With her studdingsails abroad and royals she makes a glorious sight on the water. I spell out the flags as they break out on her mizzen top: 

“H-A-V-E A N-I-C-E T-R-I-P” 

“That’s truly handsome of them, Captain,” says Miss Dangerfield. 

“Indeed it is!” I say, and then “Pass the word for our signalmen. You sir: spell out “Y-O-U A-S W-E-L-L.” 

I reach to pick up Mr. Blythe, supporting him beneath his shoulder. “Open your eyes, Mr. Blythe. The view is quite stunning from here.” 

Reluctantly he lets them focus. Then his face brightens into something almost like happiness, and he gives a reptilian smile. “I’m amazed!” He says. “Amazed!” 

“Take my glass,” I say, unsure of why I no longer despise the fellow, “just don’t drop it. There - to the starboard … no, to starboard …there you are sir … you can make out the western tip of Formentera.” 

“Incredible!” He says, whimsically sweeping the telescope in a slow circle of the horizon. 

The tea finally comes up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love. 

Blythe suddenly freezes, the glass pointing straight ahead inline with our bow. 

“And captain…what are those sleek, shiny vessels cruising with such graceful speed around the cliffs there?” 

It’s as I feared. We’d dodged the French blockade, sure, but we’re small fish for them. It’s different for these local harbor cops with their ocean flyers: this is all they do. 

“Baltimore Clippers,” I say, without needing to look. I flick my cigar and watch it soar away and fizzle into the ocean. “Revenue Cutters.”

I’m trying to lock in an iced recipe for the Hario Switch (larger size) that yields ~500 ml for a single serve.

For reference, my standard iced V60 is:
	•	30 g coffee
	•	200 g ice in the server
	•	300 g hot water through the bed
= ~500 ml finished drink

That works great on a regular V60, but I haven’t found a Switch-specific workflow I love yet. I’m looking for repeatable, step-by-step guidance for the Switch that hits the same output and cup profile.

What I’m after:
	•	Target yield: ~500 ml in the cup
	•	Style: bright, sweet, clean “flash brew” (not overnight cold brew)
	•	Switch usage: happy to do full immersion, hybrid (bloom then hold), or drip-assist—whatever delivers
	•	Details I’d love from you:
	•	Dose (is 30 g still optimal, or should I scale?)
	•	Grind (relative to hot V60—finer/coarser?)
	•	Water temp
	•	Ice split (ice-in-server vs ice-in-Switch, % of total water on ice)
	•	Timings (bloom duration, immersion hold, when to flip the switch, total drawdown)
	•	Agitation (stir/swirl? how much?)
	•	Expected brew time and taste notes
	•	Any filter pre-wet / paper tips specific to the Switch

Would really appreciate your dialled-in Switch recipes with the exact grams, temps, timings, and agitation that work for you.

I watch you from the corner, half drained coffee in hand, legs slung over the couch..

Every glance you throw feels like a dare.
You think you’re measuring me. 
Maybe you are.

Maybe I’m the one calculating.. 
Every pause. Every half smile. Every almost laugh.. 

And that look. God that look...

The air bends around us.
Quiet but heavy.
Carrying a tension that smells faintly like cigarette smoke and too sweet princess perfume...

You stop near the window...The light hits your hair just right..For a second I forget the world outside. Cars, neighbors, college kids rushing by like it doesn’t exist.

We circle, slow, deliberate, testing edges without touching.
Your hands hover near the counter, drumming a rhythm you think I don’t notice..

I do.
Every micro movement, every hesitation, is a conversation..

I don’t ask for surrender. I just notice when you lean in too far like you want to give it..

You know it. 

I know it.

There’s a gravity in that recognition.
You’ve been waiting for someone to see it without needing to own it.
Someone who understands that restraint is its own kind of dominance.. 

That noticing is a kind of worship.

When we finally cross the invisible line.. 
Your pulse brushing mine for the briefest second it lands like a whisper... ^(""I want you"")

The hunt is acknowledgment.
It’s mutual.
It’s knowing that the moment we finally let go, we’ve both been ready all along.

We linger in the aftermath.
You taste it on my lips..
Hide it in the way your focus drifts to the mundane,,,  street noise, half forgotten texts, YouTube.. 

I can still see the pull in your eyes, when I tell you to look at me.. That's it good girl..

The tension hasn’t left. It’s woven into the fabric of the room. 

Silent promises that we’ll circle again.
We’ll test edges. Measure patience. Trade glances like soft declarations. 
Almost confessions.

You were never prey, and I was never predator.
We are both something sharper, something older than desire.
And in that realization, we keep moving eyes locked, hearts cautious, always hungry, always waiting for the next slow burn.

I was sitting on my phone because i had no customers (yes ik i shouldnt be). I turned around and saw my coworker (30ish) had 10 sandwichs on the counter and i asked “do you need any help?” And they told me “No im doing it a certain way” So i just said ok and went back on the register. 3 separate people walk in so im taking their orders and they start asking me to grab me all these things (its right behind them if they turn around and look to the right n they know that). I told them im with a customer hold on, not in a disrespectful tone either just telling that i cant just leave the customer standing there. They started getting all disrespectful saying “do it thank you” over and over so i got a little annoyed n said hold on what the hell and they proceeded to just keep saying in a nasty tone “thank you” over and over. After all the customers were from from the register i grabbed the things they asked for and said “Idk why u feel like u can disrespect me just because youre 20 something years older than me but you cant”. ( They’re a mother of 2 kids also keep that in mind) And left it at that. Yesterday i came in and didnt have any interaction with them all day until i came back from my 30. I was on register again and they were on warming and i asked my shift if i can go to the bathroom (This coworker is a shift but not the one on duty either days.) And she said yes and i heard them say “Again?” under their breathe behind me. so i ran to the bathroom but there was people in both bathrooms so i went back and just waiting and my shift asked if i was that quick so i just told her there were people in there n i heard “good” so i was like ok wth.. So then after my 10 i had 20 minutes on my shift left and was told just clean in the back so i did. I was talking to 2 my coworkers that im “work friends” with and they came back asking for one of them. I didnt turn my whole body to look just a side eye (yes i get that could’ve been taken the wrong way but not THIS far) So my coworker goes with them and they say “do i need to get her a violin?” (I wasnt complaining or anything didnt even say anything when they walked into the back) So obviously i was annoyed and then they came back to go on their 10 so i said “Why do u feel the need to constantly disrespect me lately?” and they BUGGED OUT. started yelling at me saying they hate me never wanna work w me again (not 100% sure because i was on the other side of the back but i feel like i heard die somewhere in there idk) so i said “you hate me bro wtf??” And they were walking out the back and said im BALD HEADED.

Tooth sensitivity can be more than just a minor inconvenience – it can dramatically impact your daily life, making simple activities like eating, drinking, or even breathing uncomfortable. If you've ever winced while enjoying an ice cream cone or sipping a hot cup of coffee, you're not alone. Millions of people experience dental sensitivity, which can range from mild discomfort to intense pain. Understanding the underlying causes and finding effective solutions is crucial to maintaining your oral health and quality of life.

Understanding Tooth Sensitivity: What's Really Going On?

Tooth sensitivity occurs when the protective layers of your teeth become compromised, exposing the underlying nerve endings. The delicate inner structures of your teeth become more responsive to temperature, pressure, and certain foods, creating that sharp, uncomfortable sensation many people dread.

Common Causes of Tooth Sensitivity

1. Enamel Erosion
Tooth enamel is the hard, protective outer layer of your teeth. When it wears down, sensitivity increases dramatically. Several factors contribute to enamel erosion:
• Acidic foods and drinks
• Aggressive brushing
• Teeth grinding
• Medical conditions

2. Gum Recession
Receding gums expose the tooth's root, which is much more sensitive than the enamel-covered portion. This can happen due to:
• Periodontal disease
• Aggressive brushing
• Natural aging process
• Genetic predisposition

3. Dental Procedures
Recent dental work can temporarily increase tooth sensitivity. Procedures like:
• Teeth whitening
• Fillings
• Crowns
• Root canals

Medical Conditions Contributing to Tooth Sensitivity

Several medical conditions can exacerbate tooth sensitivity:
• Acid reflux
• Eating disorders
• Dry mouth syndrome
• Diabetes
• Hormonal changes

Effective Solutions for Tooth Sensitivity

1. Proper Oral Hygiene Techniques
• Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
• Brush gently in circular motions
• Use toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth
• Avoid brushing immediately after consuming acidic foods

2. Dietary Modifications
Reduce consumption of:
• Carbonated drinks
• Citrus fruits
• Sugary foods
• Extremely hot or cold beverages

3. Professional Dental Treatments
• Fluoride treatments
• Dental bonding
• Surgical gum grafts
• Root canal (in severe cases)

Prevention Strategies

**Preventing tooth sensitivity** is always better than treating it. Consider these proactive approaches:
• Regular dental check-ups
• Using fluoride mouthwash
• Wearing a nightguard if you grind teeth
• Maintaining a balanced diet

When to See a Dentist

While some tooth sensitivity is normal, persistent or severe pain requires professional attention. Schedule a dental appointment if you experience:
• Continuous discomfort
• Sensitivity lasting more than a few weeks
• Pain when biting or chewing
• Visible damage to teeth or gums

Advanced Treatment Options

For chronic tooth sensitivity, dentists might recommend:
• Desensitizing treatments
• Prescription-strength toothpaste
• Dental sealants
• Customized treatment plans

Conclusion

Tooth sensitivity is a complex issue with multiple potential causes and solutions. By understanding the underlying factors, practicing good oral hygiene, and seeking professional guidance when needed, you can effectively manage and reduce dental discomfort. Remember that every smile is unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. Patience, consistent care, and professional dental support are key to maintaining healthy, pain-free teeth that allow you to enjoy life's simple pleasures without hesitation.",1,1755433722.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

One evening around 9 pm I was walking home, sat at a bus stop to change shoes, and a younger guy suddenly came out of his apartment. I assume he had seen me before, since I used to walk that route daily up to the forest.He asked where I was going, told me he had seen me walking, and then suggested I “chill” at his place. I said no. The next day he saw me again on the bus and was persistent, even driving one station further when I didn’t get off. After that, I deliberately changed my route and stopped walking in that direction.

Now I walk the opposite way, about 20 minutes up to the river (roughly 5 km away from the forest). But then it happened again with a different, older man. This time around 5 pm. At first I thought it was the same guy (I’m a bit shortsighted), but it wasn’t. He waved at me from afar at the train station, I ignored it and kept going. Today, a week later, he did the same at the train station around 8 am, waving from a distance. About 15 minutes later, even though I had taken a different route home, he suddenly drove by and stopped in a side street (creepy) and asked if I wanted coffee. I said no and walked away. I don’t know how he knew which way I was walking. It also didn't seem like  he was genuinely waiting for the train.


It’s weird and unsettling that strangers are noticing my walking routine. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you stay safe ? I feel like I might need to change my route again.",31,1755433633.0,walking,22,1.0,False

She’d push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn’t come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was “too messy.”

Every time I opened up, she'd say: “If you don’t like it, I’ll just leave.”

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom’s birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would… and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no  and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn’t let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn’t going to a party  so I said I’d go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside… her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: “Should we download an app and find you a hot girl?”


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn’t even check on me. Just said: “I won’t text you unless you text me first.”

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should “just be friends.” But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn’t want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking  she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled… then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I “sent her to a mental clinic.” Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom’s birthday  I didn’t go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

To this day… I don’t know what I did so wrong. My feelings for her were real.

I can't get out of this spiral

TL;DR:
I dated a girl who constantly pushed me away while pulling me back in. She canceled plans, played jealousy games, blocked me, told me I didn’t love her, and made me feel guilty for everything. She refused to let me close to her family, hid her phone, and kept giving mixed signals hot and cold, sweet and cruel. Even after I ended it, she cried, said I ruined her, then reached out again as if nothing happened. To this day, I don’t know what I did wrong just that my feelings were real, and I’m still stuck in the spiral.",2,1755433477.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

	•	Not a Stanley. Nothing against them, I just don’t need the hype.
	•	No handles. My fisty cuffs do just fine wrapping around a tumbler, and I don’t want a handle snapping off if it gets tossed in a bucket with my other gear.
	•	No straw. Just give me a solid lid I can sip out of.
	•	Size: 16oz or bigger.
	•	Performance: It needs to keep coffee hot (or cold) through a 10–15 hour workday.
	•	Durability: I’m aiming for two+ years without having to replace it.

Basically I don’t want a giant monstrosity that takes up more room than my ego. I just need something tough, reliable, and built to last. Bonus points if it’s not the ugliest thing I’ve seen since Sméagol/Gollum.

Yesterday I went out for a meal - alone - at one of my favourite restaurants here, and I took my laptop along as I like to work out of a cafe or restaurant for a change of scene. I was looking forward to a day of good food and getting some work done in one of my favourite spots.

Ordered breakfast and had just started settling in after an hour or so. It was late morning and all the breakfast diners had emptied out by then, so I was pretty much alone, with two businessmen discussing deals at the far end of the restaurant. I was enjoying myself, when promptly an Indian guy comes and takes the table right next to mine, quite unnecessary I thought, when he could have sat anywhere else. So we are both seated on the same wall sofa, next to each other.

Quickly glances over at me several times, seems to take in my bag and shoes (both low-end to mid-range designer brands) and seems somewhat surprised, bcos my clothes were pretty regular and I don't really look like a ""rich"" person by Dubai standards.

Then he starts slurping his coffee loudly... like embarrassing level slurping, not something I would expect a patron at an above-average priced restaurant in Dubai do. Then he turns in my direction while still holding his cup - leaning over in my direction as much as he can - and mutters something quickly, no doubt something he meant me to hear, but I couldn't catch it.

Then puts on his headphones, makes a call and starts talking loudly, partly English and partly slipping into that squeaky, high-pitched Hindi that grates on the ears. At that point I had enough, and I moved to a table at the other end of the row - and a waiter and waitress both hurry over to help me out, as if they both were expecting this. Now, the restaurant is inside a mid-range hotel, and the man was obviously a guest there, and from his call, I could make out he was discussing business. Why do Indian men even of this class - who are obviously fairly well off, travel internationally etc - behave so oddly with women? Why do they always try to make you feel uncomfortable? Do they genuinely feel discomfort at seeing women just being themselves and living their lives? Or do they think any woman alone, by herself, in a public space is fair game?

This had often been my experience living in India - if i tried to go watch a movie alone or be at a cafe by myself, enjoying my day - some loser would sit right behind me or next to me and start staring, troubling or try to grope, but I did not expect Indian men in Dubai of above average socioeconomic means and education to display this behaviour. If they want to approach you, there is a decent way to do that - by saying hello and making conversation in a polite way.

This morning, about an hour ago, I awoke in tears after experiencing the most emotionally powerful, and realistic dream I can ever remember having. 

I am currently sitting at my kitchen island drinking coffee, and have been struggling to emotionally process the dream. I came across this sub, and figured it might be helpful to write out what I remember, and share it here…I guess with the thought that there may be some folks here who have experienced similar dreams. 

This past spring, my grandfather passed away after a few years with Alzheimer’s. Anyone who has had a loved one go through this, knows how horrible and painful it is to see. We knew his passing was coming, and after his quality of life began to sharply decline over the last couple years, it was almost a relief. 

I’ve always said, before he passed as well as after, that he was a man I aspired to be like. 
I suspect that my feelings towards him as a man I looked up to, are relevant when thinking about the dream.

He was a loving husband and father. He was an incredibly kind and loving grandfather, who made sure he always had an active and supportive role in the lives of his grandchildren.

He was an absolute goof, a prankster, something he learned from his father. 

(Quick example- when my great-grandfather was in a nursing home, he and my grandfather bought fake dog poop. They would keep it in my great grandpas dresser drawer at the home. 

Every once in a while, they would put it on the floor, and then start yelling for a nurse. The nurses would come rushing in to find this dog poop on the floor of the room, while my great grandpa and grandfather would be yelling about how some smelly dog just came into the room, pooped, and ran off. 

The nurses would frantically start to look around for a random dog, before finally my grandfather would pick it up and say, “oh, I guess it’s fake poop! Sorry!”) 

Anyway, he obviously made a big impact on my life. He always made sure to spend one-on-one time with each of his grandkids, forming a special and individual bond with every one of us. 

When I was growing into my teens, as an energetic boy with undiagnosed ADHD, I began to struggle more in school. This led to me starting to rebel, as well as finding myself getting in trouble more often. Drinking, smoking, partying, etc…

My parents were worried about me. They went to a therapist, as did I. But my grandfather always believed in me. I remember many long talks at his kitchen table, where I learned how similar we were. He struggled with academics and getting into trouble as well. 

He would always look directly into my eyes, with a firm but deeply sincere look, and say, “you’re going to be just fine”.  

Whenever we said goodbye, he would tell me he loved me..then would get a big smile, firmly grab my shoulder, and say, “just don’t be stupid!”. 

So that’s just a little about my grandfather, perhaps as context, or maybe it just makes me feel better to type all of that out..either way, onto the dream- 

It took place at my parents house, where I grew up, in our living room. There was family over, it might have been a holiday or birthday, I couldn’t tell for sure. 

Also there were some members of my wife’s family, specifically her Uncle Paul, who has only ever met my family on our wedding day. Sadly, my grandfathers condition was too severe at that point to be there. 

Also there, was one of my wife’s best friends, Cass, of whom we had just taken a day trip to visit yesterday. 

We were all (unfortunately) discussing politics…I am not sure what I said, but my wife’s friend  responded with some sort of compliment or affirmation towards me, because I then said, “thanks Cass for hyping me up! You and Emily (my wife’s other best friend- I adore both of them) are always good at hyping me up!”  - This might not be the exact words, but it was close to it. 

My wife’s uncle then said something about a certain politician being a jerk, and as I was agreeing and talking to him, a familiar voice said something like, “Yeah, he’s a jerk, they’re all jerks, we always have to pick from jerks”. 

I turned, and it was my grandfather, sitting in a chair right next to me. I remember being shocked in the dream..like I legitimately remember myself looking at him, mouth agape, in disbelief. He looked younger and healthy, probably like he did when I was maybe a teen. 

I put my hand on his shoulder, and remember being able to physically feel him there. Like I can’t even explain it, but It was so real. 

In absolute shock, I just said something like, “grandpa, where have you been??” or “grandpa, how did you get here?”.

He smiled and pointed at something in the room, maybe a shelf or table, and said, “I’ve been right here, right where your mom put me!”.

In the dream, I burst into sobbing, and woke not long after to find myself still sobbing. It took me a bit to even settle myself. It wasn’t a “bad dream”, or anything like that. It was pretty normal feeling. 

In fact, the moment I saw my grandfather sitting next to me, and felt his shoulder in my hand, I was overwhelmed with feelings that I can’t really describe..maybe Joy, gratitude, or simply just disbelief. But they weren’t feelings of sadness, despair, or grief.

My grandfather was cremated, and my mother has the ashes in an urn at home, so I guess maybe that was the meaning behind what he said…

For a little more context, the other people I spoke to in the dream (my wife’s uncle and friend), are people I find to be truly caring, kind, and comfortable to be around. 

I generally am not one to sit and analyze the meaning behind my dreams. I am not religious in the traditional, institutional sense. I consider myself agnostic. But I do believe in the possibility that people can have strong spiritual connections on deeper levels than they have with others. 

I guess writing this out and expressing my emotions is a way of analyzing as well as processing. I feel a lot better already by this point. 

I am not sure if anyone here has had any similar experiences. I don’t even know what I’m looking for by posting this. But if this resonates with you, or you’ve had something similar happen, feel free to share your thoughts. 

Thanks for being here if you’ve read this far, and I hope all of you have a good Sunday 💚

#Alien Nation, Book Two, Chapter Two: Meet the New Boss

*****

###Mental Map

Natalie’s initial impression from the air left her disappointed, but once we’d settled down into the complex, she’d been like a kid in a playground. Pushing around the perfectly balanced giant artillery guns had put a huge grin on her face. We’d gotten a few shots of me jumping atop the barrel and balancing atop it, practicing parkour scrabbling up the cement bunkers. The weirdest part was doing the video as if she wasn’t right around the corner. We’d only stopped when she’d seen the maintenance machinery tripped over the leg of a misplaced stool in her haste to explore and faceplanted.

A quick trip back to the family car while her cut was assessed gave me the breathing room I needed to check the town and time. I’d have to hurry.

“She’s alright?” I asked.

“She will be,” Morsh confirmed. “But I think we should call it quits.”

“Do you think we have enough footage?” I asked. Morsh’s inscrutable expression didn’t waver. “I should get her looked at.”

“Alright,” I agreed. “Natalie, are you alright to go with Morsh?”

“Y-yeah,” Natalie said, looking at where she’d skinned herself and then up at me.

“Alright,” I said, taking my bike out of the trunk. “You two should get going, then. I’ve got some time to flesh out the last of the script I have for this place. And hey, for once, it’ll be real. You won’t be next to me this time. I’ll do the rest of the recording, ship it off, and then we can meet tomorrow?”

She looked like she was going to object right up until I suggested tomorrow.

“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Morsh finally put her foot down, arms crossed in a way that suggested she was deeply unimpressed by my independent streak.

Boys on Shil’vati worlds didn’t just go off on their own, after all.

The typical Shil’vati Marine resembled little so much as a female orc someone had carefully and meticulously groomed until she was undeniably female, and then stuffed into a 1960’s idea of a futuristic military jumpsuit. The form-fitting uniforms left distractingly little to imagine of their tall, well-muscled, slender bodies. I’d also seen one easily lift a grown man with one arm and max out a weight machine, so I knew better than to think the appearance of those muscles merely cosmetic. And as was apparently usual for the broader galaxy, Shil’vati women were the predominant species both in number and martial preeminence. And even among them, Morsh was quite a specimen of lethality. There was doubtless a good reason the Noble Rakten family felt comfortable with a Militia of just one, when the Fleet’s restriction-of-force policy limited Noble Militia, but not *that* severely.

Earth was something of a complete outlier to them. They found us amusing, right up until things like *this* happened.

“Oh,” I said, tapping the embossed, and then stamped pass I’d stuck in a laminated lanyard that dangled around my neck. “I think I’ll be alright.”

“This isn’t Delaware, kid. Emperor doesn’t run the insurgency here.” As far as either of us was *supposed* to be aware, that was true. Sure, everyone suspected Emperor as the one responsible for the surrounding states’ rising insurgent activity, but so far no one could prove a direct link rather than insurgents being inspired by my victories.

“Don’t worry, no one even knows I’m here,” I laughed. “I’ll be careful, and on my bike.”

Natalie let out a hiss as she stretched her knee again and Morsh finally relented with a disapproving grumble. “You check in, okay?”

“Promise,” I almost instinctively did the insurgent salute before changing it to a couple fingers tapping my chest. “Cross my heart and hope to die.”

She stared at me for a few seconds. “Nataliska’s right. You humans have the strangest phrases.”

And then they were gone, the Rakten family flying sedan arcing through the sky.

*****

My meeting with George had been frustratingly illuminating. Taking my bike from the park had been over Morsh’s objections- but with a pass in hand, who was she to say otherwise? I rode from the western-northern tip of New Jersey via the Hudson Trail all the way to Freehold, my mind buzzing with questions.

The volume of knowledge he held was immense, but the gaps were troubling.

He understood the losses were high. I could show him the numbers I was getting, that losses were higher than recruits. That much was obvious. It was the ‘why,’ where he was lost- and he hadn’t even been able to formulate and organize his thoughts to ask the questions well enough.

*Why* were losses here higher? Were the enemy reinforcing faster via some methodology? If so, was that something the others would have to look out for? What was the Reinforcement Time (RT) After First Moment of Engagement (AFME)? Were they utilizing newer technology, like observational overhead drones? Were the jamming fields not working anymore? Were fire teams not adequately following our instructions on how to conduct an ambush?

Maybe he’d tried to run before he could walk, and had forgotten the way that we’d those things. It had all been by painful experimentation.

I parted with a reminder that New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, all were different to Delaware. We had to basically start over. George’s top lieutenant kept staring at me, but stayed silent in the background, observing, providing details only when prompted by George.

I’d had to leave him with these mysteries to solve. All I could do was advise ways to try and suss them out before I was due home, leaving me to wonder where and how things had gone wrong, and whether I’d have actually done any better in his place.

Supposedly Maryland had seen an adaptation where a physical data cable now ran from their bodysuit up to the helmet. It didn’t restore their comms or coordination from the Data Team satellites, but it did at least allow their targeting system to function. When that was coupled to the thermal sensors located in their helmets, it made engagements far more lethal, and ambushes far more difficult. Firing from the chest and hip was no longer anything like firing blindly since the reticle on their visors worked again. Was that what was happening? George didn’t know.

Were the cells being rooted out due to loyalist entrenchment? A bunch of new faces arriving in town with insufficient backstories? Was our method of inserting cells not working? Were the connections hastily made in jail cells too tenuous to be the basis of much? Had they been under observation in those cells, accidentally confirming to the shil’vati? Were the compromised individuals somehow catalogued and flagged for retrieval the moment they were spotted over the border?

All these questions were met with that same frustrating: *“I don’t know.”*

More irritating was that I could tell from under that mask just how frustrated *he* was. It wasn’t that George didn’t care to know or was fundamentally incurious. And even I was unsure as to how to tackle these problems. He’d made further advancements in the railgun designs, and even demonstrated a slingshot-like forearm brace for the ‘wristbreaker,’ railgun pistols. Excellent work, but what good were they if we weren’t gaining ground? We’d started in Delaware with less and made more progress.

Even the extra time of the train ride to Jamesburg, and from there to Monmouth Junction and the final connector home hadn’t exactly given me many answers. What few I had, I wrote down in a notebook. While I trusted Natalie’s omni-pad to deliver me the map instructions to deliver me a route to meet with George, it felt like a betrayal of her trust to start using the omni-pad she’d given me to lay more effective plans to kill her people. I was aware it was a paper-thin moralism with no practical difference, but there was just something about using it that way that felt *wrong.*

The last light had faded, leaving me staring at my own reflection, the occasional headlights or rare streetlight winking out at me. At last, we pulled into one of the new stations, a rather simple affair built fast and cheap. A crushed stone surface for people to stand on, a simple slanted roof under a couple steel beams, and a low platform. ADA considerations had gone out the window with prosthetics, though I could see the construction machinery nearby, a more permanent structure already underway.

I glanced back down at my notebook, trying to rally my concentration back to the task at hand.

I considered the other fronts, looking at the figures I’d scribbled down there.

New York City was proceeding well. Pennsylvania was struggling under Radio’s leadership, something about there being *too many people* to operate without loyalist eyes on them to spoil ambushes, as well as dedicated and surprisingly active loyalist cells. Maryland, despite receiving the lowest aid, was developing nicely under the CIA’s auspices and their chosen Lieutenant, whose name I wasn’t even able to recall immediately.

They had even given me good intel, but it grated at me that I’d had to rely on the CIA to get it. How many revolutionaries had been deposed by the CIA the moment the two didn’t see eye-to-eye? Did I really trust Gavin and Sullivan? Certainly, with the bulk of our funding as they relocated and opened new manufacturing plants in Delaware. I trusted them with training up new recruits.

They’d proven themselves…but only so far. This sense would not go away, even as dozens of railguns rolled off assembly lines. Even if I couldn’t have done what we’d accomplished without their notes in the first place, their help via Miskatonic and other research groups passing us notes, taking feedback, and coordinating black market buyers on the other end of many of Sam’s deals.

Even though they’d been there almost since the start, I still regarded them as something ‘tacked on’ to our rebellion, rather than a genuine part of the Inner Circle. Maybe I didn’t want to replace Larry and Verns, undeniably good men, with a pair of snakes.

Or maybe I was reluctant to let go of Larry’s advice: *Always trust your gut over what someone else tells you. Other people can have all kinds of interests, but your gut’s always going to be in your corner.*

#Meet the New Boss

The morning brought not only the long-expected arrival, but yet another vid-message.

Still going through her morning routine, the state of Delaware’s acting Governess-General put the video message on autoplay, noting that it was from the usual group of noblewomen still furious that Amilita hadn’t levelled the state the moment the last of the hostages had been set free.

She’d all but memorized the main talking points by now: *Do you know what kind of example this sets? What sort of General are you, one who raises her lips over her tusks when the enemy is a man? If you don’t act on this immediately then I’ll have you replaced. You’ll be rubberstamping marriage proposals with Bal’shir on Alpha Centauri before you know it,- oh wait, you’re not even a noblewoman. Your career, over! Your life, over! Do you get it yet? Order your Marines-*

Amilita had long since stopped bothering with a reply anymore, only listening to it in full out of her sense of duty.

The follow up messages had all landed faster than her responses could have reached possibly the nobles’ desk, each always bellowing outrage over whatever new detail of the peace that had come to light.

That no orders from either the Planetary Governess or the Fleet Admiral to rip up the truce for all the months they’d had to make up their minds said either this was all talk, or she had their tacit approval, or at least the situation was so odorous that they feared any direct involvement equated to career suicide.

It was a strange form of job security.

She spat out her morning oral cleansing routine into the faucet- a genuine, clay ‘porcelain’ fixture with shiny ornate brass handles, polished until they shone in a gold-like hue.

A General was still furnished with the same kit as any other Marine Officer, the presumption doubtless being that a noble officer would see to her own needs, with the kit there to round out anything that might be hard to come across on a tour of duty. Amilita was no noblewoman, though her entire office and quarters certainly didn’t reflect that.

Despite cashing no favors nor being a noblewoman, her office was now furnished far more finely than either Generals Zylkyn or Azraea’s had ever been.

Fine, handcrafted dense-wooden shil’vati Marine figurines depicted her standing in an imposing, but heroic manner. Careful brush strokes with crushed powders given water in her own likeness delivered unbidden. Pots of a strange texture and rustic colored clay were glazed and ‘fired’- some of the largest depicting stories via stylized pictographs. Stone busts of her own face carved from beautiful, rough rock were given with almost every visit and photo-op.

One would fairly judge her an egotist if she’d ever asked for any of these, and yet it was fear of being rude in refusing a gift, any gift, that made her keep them. Eventually, around the fifth portrait, she’d started boxing them up and shipping them offworld to try and sate the galaxy’s endless appetite for *anything* Earth, and putting the spare credits away for the bribes she’d certainly need someday just to get favors done.

There was one human handicraft that she kept on the corner of her desk, one she’d never get rid of. A little stuffed teddy bear, handed back to her by a human boy. It came with a letter written in childish, blocky lettering as he attempted to hand-write High Shil from a hospital bed: *I heard you had a week full of misfortune. This was supposed to make me feel better, but nothing worked as much as knowing you came for me when I was in trouble. If you need anything, let me know.*

*-Elias Sampson*

And hadn’t *that* kicked off a whole tempest of emotion. Her own junior officer had later kidnapped and savaged the boy, and here he was *thanking her* for coming running to save him from her own failure as a leader, even as she had within the day found herself wielding undreamed of amounts of power. Only Elias could have seen that and still offered her comfort.

She took her eyes off the bear and back to her omni-pad’s screen, checking for any other messages delivered, and wondered again about whether she should have someone from the Data Teams or Fleet screen her messages.

Her son’s message sat right beneath the announcement, but she didn’t have the time to see it. Not when she had last-second inspections to run through, if it was what she thought it was.

Her ad-hoc, temporary reign as Governess-General had been extended by the remarkable fact that at *least* the next three Governesses, all nobles of System Lady rank, had declined the appointment they’d earlier signed up for. It seemed that as much as they’d paid to be so high up in the queue, each would rather lose a little face and be out the unsecured deposit on the bribe than face the fates of the last three hapless Governesses.

*Dead & discredited, Dismissed in shame, and Dead & defeated…*

Amilita could only hope her smooth, so far incident-free tenure had hopefully convinced a brave noblewoman to find the courage to accept the posting she’d paid good bribe money to be considered for, rather than a desperate one. The scant information she’d gotten of the impending arrival didn’t indicate much, and now she knew she was out of time.

The ship that had delivered this message *also* carried an alert, marked high-priority to her and several others of significant rank and station- Planetary Governess, Regional Command, the Data Teams, and Fleet.

Based on the addresses, she’d known what it was without looking- the new Governess had finally arrived.

*****

The new Governess certainly knew how to make an entrance. Special dispensation for a militia force over two hundred strong, plus a whole host of equipment. Her own building, even, was already being unloaded by a bulk freight hauler. The Sol system by now had its own rudimentary facilities, but it seemed she wanted the point to really stick.

Militia were still inspecting the base, and the first returned to give a preliminary ‘all-clear,’ to the shuttle captain to finish the descent. They were all dressed in kit far too close to true frontline equipment for Amilita’s liking, rather than the somewhat dated stuff the exploratory fleet was given.

Notably, their equipment and cohesion of movement was at least as good as a Marine’s, and they looked well-disciplined. Doubtless the cream of the crop of the Lady’s home system. The armed shuttle’s slow descent was making a point, and Amilita knew she had no choice but to stand in formation, waiting.

Amilita’s dignity demanded she walk inside and tell the troops to break until it was finished, but she had no choice but to stand there like an idiot. She was being tested.

Finally, the armed, private shuttle settled down on its landing pads with a whirr-hiss of hydraulics. The whole bottom dropped out with a fresh phalanx of Militia, their armor especially sleek and deadly.

“Lady Cre’sin,” Amilita greeted with a slight dip in the knees, as was custom. The noblewoman did not return the gesture, instead surveying the Marines milling about the base beyond the honor guard, and striding forward.

The General turned on her heel and took the lead toward the hangar, ignoring the subtle way the bodyguards shifted their positions and sharpened up. *If they try anything, there’s a few thousand soldiers here who might have something to say about it.*

Soldiers parted for the two as they entered the human hangar, some snapping to attention, others with hands full carrying on their duties but clearly making a note, even as her militia formed a flank, staring down every Marine that dared cast a glance their way.

*****

The first several minutes had gone surprisingly well. The new Governess, Lady Cre’sin, struck Amilita as the bookish sort, if she peeled the layers away to her academy years she could see her as a young girl, eager to show she wasn’t to be taken lightly, yet obviously still nervous. Amilita had used that to the maximum advantage, suggesting the two go up together to get a ‘bird’s eye view.’ Before the Governess could balk or her Militia could step in to interfere, the General had whisked her colleague away in a smuggler’s impounded luxury hovercar.

“And this zone is still…?” Cre’sin asked, her eyes still on the transparent floor, as if expecting a smoke trail to emerge from the marshes, rushing up to meet their slowly circling craft.

Amilita at last realized what the early show of force was all about. Only extensive time around her friend, Lady Rakten, had given her the insight to sense that the noblewoman was petrified- so afraid she didn’t even dare show a hint of it. Nobles underwent training, practically bred from birth to not show their own true emotions.

How best to give reassurances without coming across as foolish or insincere?

Amilita mentally reviewed the file she’d read on her new colleague. It really said something about how far the assignment had fallen that Amilita had to have Senior Data Officer Borzun look up her name. Perhaps some of those who had put in their bribes had started specifying which zone, or what color of zone, because Amilita found it hard to believe such an otherwise unnoteworthy noblewoman was just fourth in line of all applicants.

*About five years my senior. Bought out the last two years of her service contract in the Navy to take over her house, but at least did attend basic. No commendations, no reprimands- no hallmarks of a purged record, either. Just unremarkable service in a time of peace.*

“According to some in the fleet, ma’am, yes, it’s still red.” That had been a not-so-subtle way for the fleet to tell her exactly what they thought of the settlement, without outright ordering her to do anything. She *needed* the Governess on-board before she chose to try something foolish. “But by the numbers we’re supposed to use for casualties, attacks, and so on? It’s the greenest zone on the planet.”

She’d checked the news reports her friend had gathered in the short notice they’d had, pulling whatever archives arrived in-system from ships that hailed from that sector of the Empire. The Data Diver had to expand her search for any mention of that System. By all accounts, it was an unremarkable system on a near-edge world that had a reasonable population, a decent amount of resources but nothing remarkable enough to warrant heavy, hyper-rapid investment on the scale Earth received.

Amilita tapped her tusk and wondered for the first time whether that ever engendered any kind of envy among the backwater Marines, before continuing on. *No indictments from the Interior, a clean record. Minor complaints from Cre’sin’s homeworld on levies issued for militia and other expenditures, but the family’s not known for being overly showy…either that or they just don’t have much and the selection fell all the way down to her.*

“I don’t want to be rude, but is this really the case? Or is it…?” She was polite, at least.

“My Data Teams are top notch, ma’am. I’ve stressed to them the value of honesty in reporting.” She managed a humorless smile. “It drives my Liaison Officer, Lieutenant Ryiannah, crazy.”

Paddling around the base’s inner perimeter was going well so far, so Amilita took the car up a bit higher and then started pointing out features, namely the most positive ones. The Governess pointed at the canal, but before she could say anything, her passenger leaned forward.

“There. That’s the new spaceport under construction, isn’t it?""

“Saint Georges will become a transportation hub. It connects with highways, a canal connecting two major bays, and a railroad. Perfect for moving freight, people, goods. You name it. Wilmington’s is undergoing a considerable amount of analysis, as there was a great degree of toxic waste dumped in its landfill at the proposed site. Once the landfill is done being excavated en masse and stabilized, construction will begin in earnest.”

“It’s as big as…” she stopped herself from whatever she was going to say, then her eyes strayed from Amilita’s finger, pointing past the ruins of Pea Patch Island, toward where the giant concrete piers were being reconnected by hovering ships dragging enormous neosteel cables into duracrete. Amilita answered before the new Governess could even ask. “The new bridge is still under construction- it should be done in about a week. I apologize that it wasn’t finished in time.” In truth, it might be good for her to attend its reopening.

“What happened to it?”

“The battle,” Amilita waved a hand, and it felt strange to treat it as if it was old news to be dismissed, but to calm her down she had to talk about the reconstruction, not the destruction. “We’re only a little bit behind schedule.”

“I’ve been asking for appraisals since my backlogged appointment was fulfilled. I was told the situation is quite different to what it was I was informed of at the time I applied. Now you tell me that the situation is different even to those appraisals.”

“Which do you trust most?”

“You’re in the car with me, so at least if you’re wrong, we both die.”

At least she’d stopped staring straight at the ground in expectance of catching a glimpse of their shared onrushing doom before they erupted in a giant fireball crashing down to this alien planet they found themselves posted on.

“Of course, ma’am,” Amilita changed tack. “This is often the case for Earth. Briefings don’t even begin to cover the complexity of matters. What is essential for you to understand at this stage is: The danger is over.”

The noblewoman’s expression didn’t even flicker in surprise, Amilita had to credit her that. “Is that so?” She asked, but Amilita had spent enough time around noblewomen to know when she’d thrown one off.

“There have been no attacks in over a month now. Zero casualties. Patrols are now operating in Flexi-Fiber suits, carrying their charge packs at their hips instead of loaded. We have stepped down our force and equipment requirements, and allowed ourselves to be de-prioritized for reinforcements. One of the only zones to do so, I suspect.”

“Ah. The peace agreement you brokered. I may have heard about it, once or twice.”

“And it’s working,” Amilita didn’t bite the bait. “The damage to the city has been cleaned up. You saw the off-base starports, which will function to keep growing opportunities for the humans here. There’s an arts *partnership* program, even.”

“Truly? That is encouraging,” Cre’sin was starting to actually have a little hope, letting it creep into her voice despite her training. “What is the name of this program?”

“We were going to call it *‘Artisanship, Not Partisanship,’* until it tested poorly.” Best to not mention that Emperor himself had shot it down. Rhymes featured so heavily in their poetry and other forms of art, and it had been meant favorably. They seemed very particular about their rhymes, for no good reason that Amilita could tell. Or was he just still committed to remaining an active partisan enemy? It maddened her to not know.

“The Interior is decidedly unhappy about the state of affairs. They want me to order you to kill the agreement, and to ambush him when you can.” She was freely offering information. This had to be going well.

Amilita smiled despite the knot in her stomach that had nothing to do with skipping breakfast or the altitude. “I see, and if you ask me to do that, then I’m going to advise against doing so.”

“You will?”

“If we try, your state will immediately become red again,” Amilita promised. “I’m afraid those are the terms of the peace we enjoy here. Simply put, I doubt that we could muster enough resources, even if we committed fully to anything except wholesale slaughter, and you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Marine willing to do that. When it all goes wrong, you and I will be blamed for it.”

“The Marines aren’t willing to fight?”

“Apparently it was difficult enough for Azraea to call down an orbital strike, she had to rely on her most trusted Captain, Sukodi, to ensure she’d follow the order. There’s no shortage of hurt and antipathy on both sides, but most would refuse such an order. They’ve both worked hard to keep incidents from happening. Frankly, also, I doubt the Interior cares half as much about what happens to either of us, or the peace here, or even the humans of Delaware. They have their objectives, but let’s not have them lead us into our own undoing.”

The new Governess spent a moment in silence. “It would be a shame to see this all on fire.”

“It would.”

“Say, you’re here alone, are you not? And you have a family? Why did you not use your post to send for them?”

“I was never certain how long my post would be,” Amilita admitted. “Better to not send for them until I feel secure in my post, or else they’d arrive just in time to see me be dismissed.”

“Oh come now, General Amilita, if the situation here is as secure as you say, then there should be no problem. Besides, things here may be more stable than they are out there.”

Amilita swallowed. “Of course, ma’am.” *What did she mean by that?*

“In fact, I’ll draft their papers right now for you, a pass. Call it a Governess’s friendly priority. I will need you to show me how it’s done. You say the deal is between the Emperor and the Governess, correct? Or would it be between the Emperor and the General? Or Emperor and you?”

She saw the play now. The new Governess was asking: *Who has the authority, here? Was it her state, after all? Or had the General conspired with Emperor to manage some sort of coup?* It was also a way to force her to put her family equally on the line- if this state was truly as safe as she said, then surely there’d be no objection. An absolute master stroke of diplomacy, all in one little move, and she could muster no objection to it. “The Governess, ma’am,” she supplied without protest.

“Wonderful. So if we have to renegotiate anything, it would be through me, as well?”

“I’d advise my own attendance,” Amilita cautioned.

“Your attendance as General, or your attendance as yourself?” Was she fishing for whether a salacious rumor held any merit?

In fact, Amilita simply had no illusions about her chances in anything less than a direct conflict engagement after the election results had come in. With railguns now a factor, even that was no longer the absolute certainty it once was, barring mass use of orbitals, which she didn’t have the authority to call in.

Amilita held her head high despite the affront to her honor. “Both. I have insights into the nature of humanity gained through my time serving here as an Officer. And when Emperor learned that Azraea was going to reject his offer of trading the marines, he chose to approach me to trade for Myrrah via Masarie, plus a few others before we were ordered to stop. He said at the time that my mercy during the war- the liberation, indicated I could be trusted. Humanity does not base negotiations entirely on one’s station or rank, it is built up with people over time.”

“Rather like the Coalition.”

“You’re not the first to make the comparison, but it’s circumstantial. The rank of a rotten organization, to their mind, is meaningless. A particularly rotten individual within a good organization, similarly, does not engender trust, either.”

The Governess considered this for a moment. “I suppose my comparison was somewhat unfair. I meant no disrespect.” Somehow, she’d picked up on Amilita’s discomfort. “They say Earth is a strange place. You have studied them. Would you say our Data Teams are incorrect?”

“I think their time being spent entirely in space is unhelpful. I’ve requested a rotating number of day passes for them.”

“And?”

“They were forbidden from a few towns and a couple forests. I put those areas under immediate intense scrutiny.”

“What did you find in those areas?”

She fought from pounding the instrument cluster display in frustration. “Nothing!”

“You sound adversarial toward him,” she remarked, surprised.

“You could say that.” If ever Amilita was alone in a room with him and were there no consequences she had no doubt she’d throttle him! For all he’d done, for all the chaos and suffering he’d caused.

“Meetings are one-on-one?” Amilita gave a nod. “A contradiction, then, if you advise your own attendance.”

The General only smiled. “There’s actually something I’d like to show you, ma’am. I feel this talk isn’t getting across the…idea. Would you please come with me?”

“Where?” Asked the Governess, stiffening in place.

“Lunch,” she said, moving down the tarmac and bringing the Governess in her wake. “My treat.”

“Wait, where?” She asked.

“Off base. Come on, let’s go.”

“My things are still being unloaded, shouldn’t we supervise? My shuttle has a cafe.” She glanced over her shoulder as Amilita took the luxury car over the garrison perimeter toward *Charcoal Pit.*

“Aren’t you curious, Governess? Your new state awaits you. There’s amazing cuisine and sights.” As the Governess searched for words, Amilita put the accelerator further as it shot across the sky. “I promise you, Earth is everything you hope for and more.” Amilita saw fear and greed war it out for a moment, before she accepted her colleague’s dare.

******

“And you’re sure this is safe?” Cre’sin asked for the dozenth time, eyes scanning for bodyguards and conflicted that there were none present, then touching her pass, ensuring it wasn’t blocked by anything and was prominent.

Amilita realized what she’d hoped might feel liberating for the noblewoman could instead feel like a child’s first time in the deep end.

“I’ve left the base a dozen times in an officer’s car, and made the rounds between D.C. and here pretty regularly. No target locks have been detected within Delaware in over two months.” She didn’t need to mention most of those target lock alerts used to start before she’d even cleared the base perimeter, occasional potshots pinging off the hull as people tried their luck. The noise had a distinctive note she could recall perfectly, despite the passage of time.

The Governess clearly filed away that information and tried to recalculate her idea of ‘acceptable risk threshold.’

“We receive a high number of visitor requests for the experience we’re about to get.” She gestured back at where they’d left the car, centered in the parking spot- something else humans were surprisingly particular about.

“Two months?”

“It used to be so many times a day that we stopped counting,” she added for clarity, in case she decided to examine why there’d been a supposed sudden dropoff during Azraea’s tenure, to double-check what Amilita was now telling her.

Ten minutes later, and the Governess was in a diner booth, and somehow made it look regal. To what should have been no surprise, she’d drilled herself on local culture and made eating with a fork and knife look easy as she picked up another french fry.

Amilita offered some of her plate’s bacon and eggs, and looked up as a bit of commotion from Militia coming in- who appeared to relax slightly as they caught sight of their Governess chewing a mouthful of food. With a single regal wave, they took their positions outside.

“Apologies,” she dabbed at the corner of her mouth with a napkin, where a bit of liquid golden egg yolk had not quite made it past the tusk, impeccable local manners already honed. “We were uncertain what to expect when we arrived, so they err on the side of caution. Given the last three Governesses, and the issues in their home systems, it’s hard to blame them. Besides, the situation, politically these days…” she waved a hand.

Amilita nodded as if she understood what the Cre’sin was alluding to.

Either way, she had a good feeling that Cre’sin would be the best Governess the state had ever had.

# Mail Order Groom Part 1

He was nervous.

In some respects he already knew what he was getting into. On Earth, Mail Order had *some* stigma for all involved. It would be a Sisyphean task to battle the presumptions he’d face with every introduction, waged against an entire galaxy with thousands of years of culture behind it. But he hoped, against his better judgment, that they might understand- *humanity was different*. The spaceport official's keen eye passing over every detail of the form on his omni-pad reminded him just how different this situation was- and that ‘different’ went both ways. None of that was anxiety-inducing, because it was a known factor. Something he’d prepared for.

What had him fighting the urge to pick at his fingernails in worry was the possible assumptions that his own presumptive partner might make. Whether he’d measure up to them, and what might happen if he didn’t. The bio had been brief, and with letters taking months, he’d rolled the dice. His chance to see another world, live with an alien, and get off this godforsaken rock.

The paperwork was surprisingly light reading on his end. Surely in time bureaucracy would step in and try to either fine-tune or outright end such arrangements. Such regulations existed as protection and hindrance, and right now he was about to go forward without either. *One small button press for a man, one giant leap of faith...*

Hello, glad to have this new chapter out. It has taken a lot of work to prep them to where I'm truly happy with them, but that is okay. I've improved as a writer, and if there's anything I learned from improving Alien Nation, it's that I think I'd rather save the time up front by just getting it right the first time!

I am also shaking off the rust and getting a bit faster as we go along. I don't want to make any promises, though, as I find those make me feel bad about the possibility of not meeting them, and then I sabotage myself by avoiding writing entirely. (Very unhelpful.)

Life's about to get incredibly busy, too. Delivery of the baby, baby shower, moving, and more, (in reverse order). I don't think anyone's going to call those excuses, but we'll see how things proceed. I wanted to get this 'out the door' and see how it goes with a minimum of full-proofreading.

# Summary

A lot of introspection in this chapter. The long and short of it is that Elias is confronted with the reality that George isn't doing a terribly good job as a Battlefield Commander. We also meet the new Governess- tell me what you think of her!

There's a few pieces and references here and there, which will become relevant. Especially the stuff that seems like throwaway lines!

I found this in an 1980ish diet book. It's the 'White wine diet', supposed to help with long term stalling...

You get every day (for 2 days):
3 soft-boiled eggs, 200gr of lean beef,  1 bottle  (750ml) of very dry white wine!!!

Of course,  it's mainly fluid loss, you'd need electrolytes and - you may get slightly pissed at dinner!

Here we go:
Breakfast: 1 egg, 125ml wine, black coffee.
Lunch: 2 eggs,  250ml wine,  black coffee  
Dinner: 200gr lean beef, grilled or broiled without fat. 375ml wine, black coffee. 

So, it's keto friendly! I tried it twice in my 20ies.  The first time I lost fluids, the 2nd time I went beer partying after 'dinner'!!! So, fair warming...",0,1755432979.0,keto,3,0.11,False

1mspcmz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mspcmz,Total 125.25 euro two weeks grocery hauls for 2! (Bonus meals pics and results),"Location: Belgium

Another biweekly groceries haul (and meal ideas) from yours truly. We restocked some pantry things and spent a bit on the higher end of the budget (100 - 125 euro). But we did save a decent amount of money from the discounted things. We had some people coming over for dinner, lunch and coffee so it was super nice that we managed to get some too good to go pastries and bread from the local bakery. From the same app we also got discounted fresh fish. They went straight to the freezer and i'm looking forward to grilled mackerels once the temperature cools down a bit. 

I've also started making my own yoghurt, after successfull attempt making cow milk yoghurt, next i want to try making my own soy yoghurt. It's really significantly cheaper since we usually get our yoghurt from the bulk shop. They have really nice yoghurt from the local farmer that we can get without packaging, but it's also more expensive than the ones in the supermarket. Buying milk instead to make yoghurt saves us at least €1.50 per 500ml. We also don't need a lot of energy to make yoghurt, we simply need to warm up the milk up to 85°c (takes me +/- 15min), let it cool until 45°c and add in the yoghurt starter which is the previously made yoghurt. Then we wrap the warm pan in hooimadam for about 8 hours or so until the yoghurt is set. Hooimadam works like a haybox, it's a cooking bag made from cotton and wool that insulates pans without electricity. We use it to make soup, stock, stew and now yoghurt. It's extremely handy to have to save on those electricity bills. 

Especially when i had to have the fans constantly on because the weather suddenly heated up and reached above 30. This also meant switching up meal plans to use as minimum heat generating cooking appliances as possible. You can see in the meal plan that we suddenly made a lot of salad and used mostly our air fryer because it produced less heat than oven. We don't have a bbq grill nor a garden for it, so we were extra reliant on our air fryer. But it was a nice challenge that i quite enjoyed 🙂

Meals: 

1. Lentils and mushrooms köttbullar with potato gratin and salad with lettuce, cucumber, radishes and lemon mustard vinaigrette. My partner lived in sweden for 6 years and when i went to visit him i sometimes got swedish meatballs and potato gratin from the supermarket buffet. So when i saw this recipe online, it kinda gave me the nostalgia. The gravy was really good tho the meatballs were a bit too heavy, i probably used too many lentils. But it was pretty easy to make and for sure budget friendlier than the meat version
2. Lemony salmon and onion flammkuchen with salad of lettuce, rocket, cucumber, radishes, grapes, gorgonzola and white wine vinaigrette. Flammkuchen is like pizza from the alsace region in france. It's usually made with creme fraiche, onion and bacon. Instead of bacon i used some salmon cooked with lemon because that's what we had. I liked it better because it gave a nice refreshing summer taste that fit very well with the sweet caramelised onion
3. Bao bun with marinated tofu and pickled radish, paprika, carrot and cucumber. I had some time in the weekend and i had always wanted to try this recipe since i came accross it on youtube. The bao bun was easy to make, it required flour, yeast, water, sugar and some sesame oil. I marinated the tofu with soy sauce, five spice, ginger, garlic and spring onion. And i quick pickled the veggies with vinegar and sugar. I got too ambitious with the serving of the veggies haha but the tofu was there for sure. 3 buns were more than enough to keep me full and happy
4. Lentils bobotie with yellow rice and salad with lettuce, green beans, tomatoes, cucumber, rocket and chili lime dressing. Another new recipe! We got some people over for dinner and a dish like bobotie is great because we can just make a big batch and pop it in the oven. The recipe called for brown lentils but we didn't have them so my partner used the yellow ones. We got a homemade apricot jam from my in laws and he used it in the bobotie. It was sweet, refreshing and extremely filling. For sure a great budget meal to make if you want to make big sized meal
5. Gado gado with spinach, cabbage, bean sprouts, cucumber and peanut sauce, rice, and air fried tempe. Gado gado is an indonesian salad made from blanched veggies served with peanut sauce. It's very popular in the netherlands. We made our own peanut sauce since i like mine to still have that crunch, hence the thicker and lumpier texture. You can also add eggs and potatoes to make it a filling meal on its own. For the tempe i made a batter of flour, water, salt and coriander powder before air frying them
6. Chickpeas and cannellini beans salad with lettuce, rocket, parsley, paprika, cucumber and lemon tahini dressing, and toast with gorgonzola and honey balsamico figs. We really didn't want to cook because of the heat, so we made this salad. We got some figs from my in laws and they were getting soft so we brushed them with some balsamico and olive oil and popped them in the air fryer for 5 minutes. We toasted the bread and melted the gorgonzola in the air fryer too. Then we drizzled in some honey and a bit of pine nuts
7. Pasta salad with field salad, fusilli, black beans, peas, corn, cucumber, paprika, tomato and yoghurt lime dressing. Another salad dinner because it was so dang hot outside and inside. It's a caribbean inspired salad and very simple to make, but quite filling and super refreshing. You can mix in any veggies or fruits you want, i think some nice tart apples would be great here too
8. Fish and chips with salad of lettuce, paprika, tomatoes, cucumber and mozzarella. It's friday and i really felt like having some fries. My partner offered to make fish and chips and i simply couldn't say no. He used some panko to make the fish extra crunchier and he chopped the fish into smaller bites which is my preference and with a a drizzle of lemon juice they were so light, fluffy and refreshing. Yum!
9. Mondanyaki with cabbage, carrot, shiitake mushrooms and egg noodles. We make okonomiyaki from time to time to use up scraps of veggies, and this time i tried mondanyaki which used noodles. It turned out a bit deconstructed because i'm terrible at flipping pancakes. I also didn't add in mayo because i don't really like it. But one thing for sure the noodles really helped to bulk the okonomiyaki up, making it not only super delicious but even more budget friendly.
10. Sweet and sour tamarind soup with courgette, tomato, cabbage, carrot, chickpeas and rice. FINALLY the temperature went down and in celebration i made this sweet and sour tamarind soup. It's perfect for summer because it has a very fresh taste that goes perfectly with the seasonal veggies. I put in whatever leftover veggies we had left and some chickpeas, mixed in some rice and voila, a very tasty and homey soup ready to be served!",5,1755432940.0,budgetfood,2,0.86,False
1mspcc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mspcc9/wibta_for_refusing_to_take_my_baby_to_my_in_visit/,WIBTA for refusing to take my baby to my in visit my laws’ dirty house,"I (35f) am expecting my first baby with my husband (36f) early next year. 

My in laws are super warm and loving people, and are very excited for the baby. Both are in their mid-70s, but MIL’s physical and mental health (Alzheimer’s) is not good so life isn’t easy for them. SIL (42f) lives with them - we get on well but she can get quite defensive and argumentative even over innocuous topics.

When husband and I first got together 9 years ago, I noticed their house was quite messy and dirty. I am a clean freak so I probably noticed it more, but husband also agrees that their house isn’t as clean as he’d like. It’s gotten worse in recent years, no doubt due to MILs health and the extra burden that brings on looking after a home. eg crockery, cutlery and kitchen utensils not properly washed, stove and fridge are grimy, visible layer of dust under furniture that a baby would get to (eg coffee table), floor not hoovered for weeks (I once saw food crumbs that were dropped on a previous visit still there when we next visited a few weeks later), years of cobwebs on the ceiling, and a new bathroom they got installed last year is already quite mucky.

A few years back we got worried at the decline and suggested they get a cleaner, but SIL took personal offence, her and my husband had an argument and the idea got shut down and we never raised it again. When we visit them now I just keep quiet, avoid using the toilet and ask my husband to clean the plate I’m given if it’s dirty.  

However now that we’re having a baby it’s on my mind again. My in laws will want us to bring the baby over lots (as MILs health makes the 1+hr car journey to our house tough to do regularly) but I am worried that the (in my view) unsanitary environment isn’t good for a baby. I am not typically an anxious person but we’ve had a long infertility and IVF journey so that’s made me quite nervous about the pregnancy and health of the baby. I’m particularly nervous about once the baby starts crawling and puts things in its mouth, as there’s genuinely a lot of dirt on the floor, and that could make it sick.

My preference would be for my in laws to understand that their house is dirtier than normal and get a cleaner - we would even pay as they aren’t wealthy - to set my mind at ease. I’ve tried to raise it gently with my husband recently but, whilst he understands my concerns about a crawling baby, he says I’m being OCD about cleanliness and he won’t deprive his parents of time with their grandchild. I don’t want to fight with him or my in laws, but WIBTA for not wanting to expose a baby/young child’s sensitive immune system to their dirty house?

EDITED to add: husband agrees their house isn’t clean to my standard (or his) but he says it isn’t unsafe or disgusting enough to justify upsetting his parents and an argument with his sister. Baby is his priority and he’d never put it at risk. We’re just at a difference of opinion on whether this is a risk. ",64,1755432915.0,AmItheAsshole,90,0.89,False

The breakup was tough but I decided to be amicable since she was going through tough times but limited the meetings and texts. My ex has friends and people who she can rely on while her family is in another country. While we were dating she met my family about 4 times, we stayed with them they were getting nicely along. 
3 months after our breakup she was dating somebody else which I did not care about, it was good for her to move on. While in her new relationships, I would randomly receive messages from her asking where I was and with who around 11pm if she happened to see a story of me and my friends out. I completely ceased contact unless I needed to pickup some of my things she had kept. 
I met her once 6 months after breakup and made it clear we are not friends, barely acquaintances and that I do not care about her dating life and intimacy issues. 
She came a few weeks later to pick up some things she needed and asked who my best friend was. I answered my roommate and she started bawling her eyes out - at this time she is still in a relationship with someone else. 
I politely told her we cannot be friends, I thought it was over. 
I learned recently she broke up and has been contacting my friends to meet up coffee. That I do not mind as long as she doesn’t do it often but what bothered me as after I asked to stop contacting me and trying to reach for call or anything she started texting my family. 
How do I tell her to stop? I just want to move on and never see or hear from her again. I don’t want her in my life at all and I don’t know how to make it more clear to her

Yesterday I went out for a meal - alone - at one of my favourite restaurants here, and I took my laptop along as I like to work out of a cafe or restaurant for a change of scene. I was looking forward to a day of good food and getting some work done in one of my favourite spots.

Ordered breakfast and had just started settling in after an hour or so. It was late morning and all the breakfast diners had emptied out by then, so I was pretty much alone, with two businessmen discussing deals at the far end of the restaurant. I was enjoying myself, when promptly an Indian guy comes and takes the table right next to mine, quite unnecessary I thought, when he could have sat anywhere else. So we are both seated on the same wall sofa, next to each other.

Quickly glances over at me several times, seems to take in my bag and shoes (both low-end to mid-range designer brands) and seems somewhat surprised, bcos my clothes were pretty regular and I don't really look like a ""rich"" person by Dubai standards.

Then he starts slurping his coffee loudly... like embarrassing level slurping, not something I would expect a patron at an above-average priced restaurant in Dubai do. Then he turns in my direction while still holding his cup - leaning over towards me as much as he can - and mutters something quickly, no doubt something he meant me to hear, but I couldn't catch it.

Then puts on his headphones, makes a call and starts talking loudly, partly English and partly slipping into that squeaky, high-pitched Hindi that grates on the ears. At that point I had enough, and I moved to a table at the other end of the row - and a waiter and waitress both hurry over to help me out, as if they both were expecting this. Now, the restaurant is inside a mid-range hotel, and the man was obviously a guest there, and from his call, I could make out he was discussing business. Why do Indian men even of this class - who are obviously fairly well off, travel internationally etc - behave so oddly with women? Why do they always try to make you feel uncomfortable? Do they genuinely feel discomfort at seeing women just being themselves and living their lives? Or do they think any woman alone, by herself, in a public space is fair game?

This had often been my experience living in India - if i tried to go watch a movie alone or be at a cafe by myself, enjoying my day - some loser would sit right behind me or next to me and start staring, troubling or try to grope, but I did not expect Indian men in Dubai of above average socioeconomic means and education to display this behaviour. If they want to approach you, there is a decent way to do that - by saying hello and making conversation in a polite way.

1mspagf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mspagf,"Frosted Glass v1.2 is here: cleaner cards, faster UI, and a new Lite edition ✨","Hey everyone!

When I posted v1, I never expected the response it got. Your feedback, stars, downloads, and coffees absolutely floored me. Huge thank you to everyone who tried the theme and cheered me on. I built **Frosted Glass** for my own dashboard, but your reactions turned my world around and pulled me back into learning to code again. My only “dev” past was making Minecraft mods when I was about 14. Now I’m aiming to make this the theme people talk about and actually use every day.

# What’s new in v1.2

* **Glassy cards that look cleaner and more consistent** in both Light and Dark
* **Smarter internals and small optimizations** for smoother dashboards
* **New Lite edition** that keeps the same glassy look without blur
   * Designed for wall-mounted tablets and older devices
   * Fixes the dropdown misplacement issue caused by blur
   * Feels almost identical at a glance since it is still semi-transparent and uses same glassy look

Happy theming!
