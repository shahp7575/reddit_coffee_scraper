1ku1np4,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1ku1np4/is_a_basement_woodshop_a_terrible_idea_asking/,Is a Basement Woodshop a Terrible Idea? Asking Before I Regret It.,"Hi all,  
I’m a hobbyist woodworker with a well-equipped garage shop (cabinet saw, planer, jointer, bandsaw, dust collection, etc.). We just bought a home in the Midwest with two large unfinished rooms off the basement. One is about 22x19 with 10.5’ ceilings and open joists—it feels like it’s *meant* to be a shop.

There are no windows, but I could possibly add a vent to the outside later, if needed. The HVAC and utilities are in the *other* mechanical room, so I’m not worried about pulling dust through the house.

I typically build small projects, cabinets, and household furniture (side tables, coffee tables, dining table have been recent projects). I use the shop most weekends and some evenings. The idea of working year-round in a climate-stable space is very appealing—the new garage has no heat or AC, which limits things seasonally. My current shop has no AC/heat, and it can be a real bummer in the midwest climate during the winter and summer.

Power accessibility is decent: the room has 2 circuits with a few 15amp outlets, and the panel is also in the basement. No 220V yet, but access is straightforward if I want to run it. Honestly, it’s easier than upgrading the power in the garage, which has only one circuit and 2 outlets along the wall, plus a longer run to the panel.

A few concerns I’d love feedback on:

* **Dust**: Planning to replace the door with a sealed one, add filtration, maybe build an airlock-style entry? I have a large oneida separator, and a Jet air filtration unit. Would I need more than this?
* **Sound**: The room opens into what will be our den. I don’t plan to use the shop when anyone’s relaxing down there—my wife and I usually work on our own projects before hanging out together. But still - thinking about adding an additional layer of insulation to the shared wall (it's currently open and would be very easy to add to). 
* **Ventilation**: May add a duct to the outside? Is this necessary? 
* **Material access**: Stairs down are wide, and I already break down sheet goods in the garage with a track saw before bringing them in, so that workflow won’t change.

The floor is a dead-flat concrete slab, no vibration issues, and I’ll likely add rubber pads under tools. No signs of moisture—definitely more stable and dry than the garage will be. 

As a backup, the house also has a 3-car garage. I could convert one stall if needed, but again, no HVAC and worse electrical access.

Has anyone here made a similar move indoors? Did it work out long term? What should I plan for or avoid?

Thanks in advance—appreciate the collective wisdom of this sub.",1,1748055580.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

1ku1iki,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aupairs/comments/1ku1iki/putting_things_away_reasonableness/,“Putting things away” Reasonableness?,"Our Au Pair has been with us for about six weeks now- we didn’t match through an interview process as we already knew her and her family from when we lived in her country. She has for the most part been a lovely addition to our family and seems to be settling in well and making friends. 

Her hours for the summer are:

Monday 9-5 (8 hours) 
Tuesday 9-5 (8 hours) 
Wednesday 9-2:30 (5.5 hours) 
Thursday 9-2:30 (5.5 hours)
Friday 9-2:30 (5.5 hours) 

So 32.5 hours, and we’re in the US. 

We don’t ask her to do weekends, but she is always welcome to join us for activities and we pay like she was one of our own kids when she does join us. It’s 70-30 whether she opts to come along, and no pressure either way. 

But I’m struggling with what may be a translation issue- which is assisting the children with “putting things away.”

Our au pair has jumped in very well to keeping the kids’ laundry going, which I really appreciate as I am back at full time work after ten years at home, and this is the ball I was most dropping. She does the wash/dry/fold for the kids, but I asked her to have them (all girls, ages 10/8/4) put the clothing into their drawers themselves. And it just isn’t happening. The laundry sits out for days no matter how many times I remind her or the kids, and I end up having to supervise putting away 2-3 loads first thing Friday when I get home. 

It’s a similar issue with meals- she’s been doing a lovely job helping the kids make breakfast and lunch. But the milk, leftover French toast, cold cuts, etc. aren’t making it back to the fridge and are sitting out all day. This is something it would be normal for her to have the big kids do also. And the dishes make it to the sink but aren’t washed -kids are also capable of this. 

And I don’t want the kids thinking she is their maid, but I do want her to supervise them cleaning up after themselves and helping the four year old as needed. 

Today too, she helped the girls brush their hair after swimming and made really cute braids. But the brushes, detangler, extra hair ties stayed scattered about the kitchen and coffee tables. 

“Please put things away” isn’t communicating what I need it too. But I’m not sure if I’m asking too much if the kids are fed, having fun, learning her language, and getting outside. ",2,1748055083.0,Aupairs,0,1.0,False
1ku1h08,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ku1h08,"Munchies Mafia in Daan, best pastrami on this side of planet","Munchies Mafia 4.8/5.0
Will be on ubereats soon
Posted to the Taipei Foodie Delivery group on Facebook 

While browsing the Taipei sub Reddit, I came across a review and announcement of a new sandwich place, that happens to be right around the corner from where I live. Then the owner replied on the Reddit post and shared their IG @muchiesmafiatw. So I went to take a look, pictures and menu looked amazing. Im always looking for a good Western style sandwich that's not covered in sweet mayo and strange meats with either overly soft or sweet bread. All my favorites keep closing up shop. My og favorite Bing had this amazing pastrami dip served on a real French roll, then later Liquid Bread made some good sandwiches and they too closed up. Taipei likes to serve paninis and loves using the sandwich press. I like the US deli type, good fresh bread with a dab of real mayo, sliced onions, crisp fresh tomatoes, and rocket instead of lettuce with a variety of different meats be it smoked turkey, honeyed ham, or rare roast beef. 

So apparently Munchies Mafia doesn't have a phone number, you're encouraged to use IG to contact the store. The owner said he signed up for UberEats already but not sure when they will be listed. The menu showed some real promise with some of my all time favorites like pastrami and roast beef, also a handful of Italian style, plus some cheesecakes and creative milk shakes and good coffee. 

IG lists the store as closes at 8pm, a little early for the East District but ok. They are located near the corner of Daan Rd and Civic Blvd, with a small first floor with counter, 2nd floor seating, and an nice outdoor patio with a couple tables. I tried to stop by this past weekend at around 6:30 and was told they are sold out and to come back another day. Other than Bogart's BBQ, Ive hardly ever heard of a spot anywhere that sells out. 

Couple days ago, before going home, I stopped by and picked up s couple sandwiches and a latte to go. Now I can understand why they were sold out, HOLY SHIT!! It's the best pastrami Ive had in a long time. Not overly salty, perfectly cooked, moist and not overly fatty either just the right amount of sauce and veggie mix beautifully presented on a focaccia, they were sold out of the sourdough. All these other spots in Taipei that boast the best smoked meat in town or Taipei's best sando, are all full of shit. Some are more edible than others, most are quite dry and no flavor except for being overly salty. 

The roast beef on focaccia was also quite good, beef was moist and pinkish rare, perfect for sandwiches. But that pastrami, my mouth still waters thinking about it. May have to go get one today and try one of their Italian options. Menu also lists some creative milkshakes which they also didn't have and a black mamba cold brew that sounds like a must try, that they also didn't have. Hope they get on Ubereats soon, so I can order everyday like I was doing at Bing. ",1,1748054934.0,Taipei,0,1.0,False
1ku1gah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bushcraft/comments/1ku1gah/heat_transfer_in_cookware/,Heat Transfer in Cookware,"When using alcohol stoves, twig stoves or stoves with similar flame, the type of metal cookware is made of makes a huge difference in heating off contents.

Metal has a K rating.  The higher the K the faster heat will transfer through metal. 

Stainless Steel 14K

Titanium.       20K

Aluminum.       220K

Copper.         400K

Metal thickness varies in cookware so K rating is not a direct comparison.

I did a test in my shop where I make coffee for lunch. The cups used are the nesting cups for Nalgene bottles and identical in size. I used a anodized aluminum cup, a stainless steel cup, lid and an alcohol stove.

The anodized aluminum cup gave me the best result reliably over several weeks of testing. This was indoors with no wind.

The Stainless cup averaged 10 minutes to boil 12 ounces of water will the aluminum cup was 6 minutes. Times did vary but the anodized aluminum was 40 percent faster to boil on average.

The diameter of cookware makes big difference, with wider the pot the better the performance.

Before I start, let me be clear that we are still on our journey to become minimalists :)

My husband and I have been slowly but steadily decluttering, trying to be more intentional about what we keep and what we bring into our home. We (especially me) used to live as extreme maximalists. But at some point, we realized that a lot of our stress and sense of unrest came from the cluttered mess we were living in. Now, we’re reducing our belongings by selling and donating (throwing things away is our last resort, since many of our items are high quality and we hope they find new homes where they’ll be better used and appreciated).

Until recently, we lived with another roommate in a two-story apartment. Most of the belongings were ours, but the couch and coffee table were hers. Since we were close friends, we shared her couch without thinking much of it.

Then, at the end of last year, I got pregnant. Totally unplanned, but certainly that was one of the happiest moment in my life. However, one major change it brought was that our roommate would need to move out before the baby arrives, which was just yesterday.

So naturally, we thought that we need a new couch!
We immediately ordered one that *perfectly* fits our living room. The fastest delivery date was the Tuesday after Memorial Day, and we scheduled it without a second thought as if there were no other option.

But after she moved out and the couch and coffee table (we also removed a rug thinking we'll get the new one) was gone something unexpected happened. Our living room was empty, but it suddenly felt open. Breezy, fresh, and peaceful in a way it hadn’t for the past two years.

With nothing to sit on, my husband brought down his Barcelona chair from the corner of his home office and it worked beautifully. We also have a massage chair that’s also great just to sit and relax in. It turned out that this setup was more than enough for the two of us to rest, read, and spend time together in the evenings.

I used to believe a couch was an absolute must that you can’t have a real “home” without one. I never even considered the idea of living without it. But that belief was… just that, a belief. A fixed idea I never questioned.

Today, we called the furniture store and canceled our order.
Not only did we save thousands of dollars, we also gained something even more valuable. The freedom of letting go of the ""must"" and choosing what actually works for us.

Baddy, Casey, and Rhea sat in the living room, the air thick with emotions as they discussed Rhea's recent experience. Rhea's gaze wandered to her right hand, still wrapped in a healing bandage, the burn reminding her of the unknown threat lingering in the shadows.

Baddy leaned forward, her voice filled with compassion. ""Rhea, when you mentioned that mysterious woman, it sounded like she wasn't just there by coincidence. You know how things have been around here lately. Did you feel any kind of... connection?""

Rhea sighed, her brow furrowing as she thought back to that night. ""It's hard to explain, Baddy. When I saw her, it felt like she was there for a reason. There was this... powerful energy. I didn't feel afraid, but I felt like I was being watched, evaluated, almost like she was trying to decide if I was worth her time."" Rhea's voice trembled slightly, her eyes showing uncertainty.

Casey spoke up, her tone curious. ""And then she disappeared? Just like that?""

""Yeah,"" Rhea nodded. ""One second she was there, the next, she was gone. It felt like a dream—like she wasn't entirely real. But I know what I saw. There was something about her presence, something captivating. I can't shake the image of her standing there, with the moonlight behind her. I... I know it sounds strange, but it was beautiful.""

Baddy reached out, her hand resting gently on Rhea's knee. ""It's not strange at all. There's beauty even in the mysterious. But listen, we need to be careful. You were marked, Rhea, and now you've seen someone who might be connected to all this. We're dealing with forces that we don't fully understand. I just... I don't want you getting hurt.""

Rhea met Baddy's eyes, her expression softening. ""I know you're worried, and I appreciate it. I do. But I can't just sit around waiting for something to happen. If she comes back, I need to know why. I need to understand.""

Baddy squeezed Rhea's knee, her voice firm. ""We’ll figure this out together, Rhea. I promise. You're not alone in this.""

Casey chimed in, her eyes filled with determination. ""That's right. Whatever comes next, we'll face it together. And if that mysterious cowgirl wants a confrontation, she’ll have to go through us first.""

Rhea smiled, a flicker of warmth returning to her eyes. ""Thanks, you two. It means a lot.""

The three women sat in silence for a moment, the bond between them growing stronger as they silently vowed to face whatever challenges lay ahead together.

# Havenbrook City - Meeting with Old Friends

Yuri's eyes lit up when she saw Melissa King and B.A. Boom walking toward her on the bustling streets of Havenbrook City. They hugged each other tightly, and laughter echoed through the air as they reunited.

Melissa, affectionately known as M.K., pulled back, looking Yuri up and down with a teasing smile. ""Look at you, still as fierce as ever. How's life treating you?""

Yuri chuckled, shaking her head. ""Oh, you know, can't complain too much. Just hunting down a woman named Carmella. You heard anything?""

B.A. Boom’s brow arched, her expression turning serious. ""Carmella, huh? Not the easiest person to track. What's she done this time?""

Yuri sighed. ""Sold a car that wasn't hers for $2.5 million. Got a friend of ours, Mercedes, in some deep trouble. We've been trying to find her, but she seems to always be a step ahead.""

Melissa frowned, concern crossing her face. ""That’s rough. Havenbrook City's been buzzing lately with all sorts of shady stuff. I mean, the $500 million bank heist? People are saying the whole place is cursed.""

Yuri nodded. ""Feels like it sometimes. But that’s why I’m here—trying to get ahead of all of this before it gets worse.""

B.A. Boom put a comforting hand on Yuri's shoulder. ""Well, you know we're here if you need us. We’ve got your back, whatever it takes. And, hey, we’ve got some old contacts here who might know a thing or two. We'll ask around.""

Yuri smiled, a wave of relief washing over her. ""I appreciate that. I could use all the help I can get.""

Melissa grinned, giving Yuri a playful punch on the arm. ""Always, Yuri. We’re family.""

They stood there, the comfort of old friendships providing a moment of solace amidst the chaos surrounding them.

# Havenbrook City - Jennifer's Search

Jennifer, alone in a different part of the city, kept her focus on finding Carmella. She approached people cautiously, trying to gauge their reactions to Carmella’s name.

She ran into a man standing outside a small bar, his face hidden under a worn cap. Jennifer approached him with a friendly smile. ""Hey, excuse me, have you heard anything about a woman named Carmella? She's kind of been causing trouble around here.""

The man looked up, his eyes narrowing. ""Carmella, huh? You must be with the others. There are people looking for her, you know.""

Jennifer's heart skipped a beat, excitement mixed with tension. ""Yeah, I'm one of those people. We need to find her—for a friend of ours who’s in trouble because of her. Anything you can tell me?""

The man hesitated, glancing around before leaning closer. ""Word is, she’s keeping her head low. Meeting with some big players, but no one knows why. People are scared to talk about it.""

Jennifer nodded, her voice lowering. ""Thanks. If you hear anything more, here's my number. I'd really appreciate it.""

He took the paper, nodding. ""I’ll see what I can do. Good luck.""

Jennifer walked away, her mind racing. The pieces of this puzzle were coming together slowly, but she knew they were getting closer. She pulled out her phone and sent a quick message to Lady Hunter and Yuri, keeping them updated on her findings.

# Lyra's Meeting at the Bakery

The bakery smelled sweet, the scent of freshly baked bread and pastries filling the air as Lyra gathered everyone around the table. Liv, Rihanna, Michelle, and Tatum sat in a small circle, each of them with a coffee cup in front of them.

Lyra looked at her notes, her expression serious. ""We’ve all been feeling it, right? The shift in energy. Havenbrook isn’t just having bad days—something darker is brewing.""

Michelle nodded, her eyes narrowing thoughtfully. ""I’ve felt it too. It’s like there’s something—someone—pulling strings behind the scenes. And these attacks and incidents? They’re connected.""

Tatum frowned, leaning forward. ""The mark on Rhea’s hand, Carmella selling stolen cars, and that mysterious bank heist—it’s all linked somehow. We need to connect the dots before it’s too late.""

Liv glanced around, her expression hesitant. ""Do we even know what we’re dealing with? I mean, are we talking about something... supernatural?""

Lyra nodded slowly. ""It’s starting to look that way. There are people in this town with abilities—powers. Some of us here know that firsthand. Whatever is happening, it’s drawing out those who have a connection to things beyond the ordinary.""

Rihanna looked at Lyra, her expression curious. ""And what’s our role in all this? Why are we being drawn into it?""

Lyra smiled faintly. ""Because we care about this place. We care about each other. That makes us targets, but it also makes us strong. We’re not alone in this fight.""

They all nodded, a silent determination forming between them. Whatever was coming, they were ready to face it together.

# Judy Álvarez's Place

Judy and Alinity lay on the couch, cuddled up close. The two had shared a lot over the past few days, growing closer and closer as they spent more time together. Judy could feel her heart pounding, uncertainty lingering in the pit of her stomach as she glanced at Alinity.

“Hey,” Judy said softly, her voice barely a whisper. “Do you... think this is something real? Between us?”

Alinity looked at her, her eyes softening. “I do, Judy. I know it’s scary, and I know we both have a lot of baggage. But being with you feels right. Like it’s something worth holding onto.”

Judy sighed, a small smile tugging at her lips. “I think so too. It’s just... I’m scared. I’ve been hurt before, and I don’t want to mess this up.”

Alinity reached out, taking Judy’s hand in hers. “You won’t. And even if we stumble, we’ll pick each other back up. That’s what this is about, right? Trusting each other, even when it’s hard.”

Judy’s heart swelled at Alinity’s words, her fears slowly melting away. She leaned in, pressing her lips to Alinity’s, their kiss filled with a promise—of hope, of love, and of the courage to take a chance on each other.

# Alexa's Place - Deeper Conversations

Hendra and Andreja sat across from Alexa, the air in the room heavy with emotions. The journey they had been on was far from easy, but Alexa was determined to guide them toward understanding and healing.

Alexa looked at Andreja, her eyes kind yet piercing. “Andreja, what you did to Alinity—it was a betrayal that cut deeply. You told me before that you regret it, but I need to know what’s behind that regret. Is it guilt? Shame? Or is it truly a realization that you made a mistake?”

Andreja’s eyes filled with tears, her voice trembling as she spoke. “It’s everything, Alexa. I... I was lost. I didn’t know how to deal with my own pain, so I lashed out. I hurt someone who didn’t deserve it, someone I cared about. I was angry at the world, and I took it out on her. And now... now I see the damage I caused, and it tears me apart inside. I wish I could take it back.”

Hendra nodded, her eyes also glistening. “And for me, I stood by and watched it happen. I let my anger at the world blind me to the good things I had. I should have stood up for Alinity, for Andreja, for myself. But I was scared—scared of losing what little control I thought I had.”

Alexa reached out, taking both of their hands in hers. “Healing is a long, painful process. But the fact that you’re here, talking about it, willing to face it, means that you’re already on the right path. You both made mistakes, but you’re more than those mistakes. The key now is to keep moving forward—to learn, to grow, and to be better.”

Andreja wiped her eyes, her voice cracking. “Thank you, Alexa. I... I want to be better. For myself, and for the people I’ve hurt.”

Hendra squeezed Alexa’s hand, her expression softening. “Me too. We’re ready to face this, no matter how hard it gets.”

Alexa smiled, her heart filled with hope for both of them. “Then let’s take it one step at a time. Together.”

*The air across Havenbrook and Havenbrook City was charged with emotions, as everyone faced their fears, their pasts, and their uncertain futures. Amidst the tension, bonds were strengthened, friendships rekindled, and love found a way to blossom—giving them all the hope they needed to face whatever lay ahead.*",1,1748054689.0,u_SilverEnd1208,0,1.0,False

About me: I’m 30M, have friends, a job, an amazing wife, and (at least I think) I’m pretty easy going, considerate, friendly guy who likes a laugh and can hold a conversation. I keep things light, laugh at peoples jokes, have hobbies, don’t tell people what to do or have unreasonable expectations, and I’m privileged to say I don’t have any mental illness outside of the odd normal bluesy phase (normal stuff) - a normal, humble life. I especially DO NOT force friendships if it’s not a vibe.

When I call, text, or bump into someone I know, friend or acquaintance. They will say “Let’s catch up for a beer/walk/coffee”.
Then I’ll say great are you keen to catch up for a beer on [insert date]. Then I get nothing. Nothing. 

OR

We have some great times and talk about how good it would be to catch up. Then I text them saying “Hey lets do a catch up when you’re back from holiday. When do you get back again?”. 
Then they say “Yeah sounds awesome, can’t wait”. And nothing else. 
I’m then like “awesome, which day suits when you’re back?” But at work they continue being a buddy and STILL suggest a fantasy catch up.

OR 

We catch up [non-romantic scenario], they suggest it), we have a great time. they insist on paying, etc. They say we’ll do it again and I can pay next time. I hit them up for another catch up a month later and they just ghost me.

And I feel so silly, like I stuck my neck out and they just ‘saw’ the message and left me hanging. I wouldn’t be as upset if THEY hadn’t been the one  to suggest it. I AM willing to consider the possibility that it’s me, cause I am the common denominator.

After a few days, Baddy and Casey decided to check on Rhea, who had been keeping mostly to herself since the incident. Baddy knocked on the door, and Rhea opened it, her face lighting up a bit when she saw them.

""Hey, Rhea,"" Baddy said with a warm smile, stepping inside.

""Hey,"" Rhea replied, ushering them in. ""Glad you guys came by.""

The three sat down, and Baddy looked at Rhea’s right hand, the burn mark still healing. “How’s the hand?” she asked softly, a look of concern in her eyes.

“It’s better,” Rhea replied. She glanced at Casey, then back at Baddy, deciding it was time to share something strange. “You know, a few nights ago, I was out walking. I saw someone—some woman standing atop a building. She was in this black leather cowgirl outfit, just staring down at me. It was... different. I don’t know how to explain it, but she gave off a vibe, you know?”

Baddy’s expression shifted, her eyes narrowing as she considered Rhea's words. “Did she seem familiar? Or threatening in any way?” Baddy asked, curious.

“No,” Rhea shook her head, still trying to make sense of it herself. “She looked... powerful. Not threatening, just... like she was watching me, and then she disappeared. It was like she wanted to be seen, but not approached.”

Baddy exchanged a quick glance with Casey. “That’s interesting. With everything that’s been going on—the mark on your hand, the demon business—it might be connected.”

Rhea sighed. “Yeah, it all feels connected somehow, but I can’t put my finger on it.”

Baddy nodded, determined. “Well, we’ll figure it out together. You're not dealing with any of this alone.”

Casey added with a smile, “We got your back, Rhea.”

# Havenbrook City

Meanwhile, over in Havenbrook City, Yuri was walking down a busy street when she ran into two old friends—M.K., also known as Melissa King, and B.A. Boom. Their eyes lit up as they recognized each other.

“Yuri!” Melissa called out, waving.

Yuri turned and smiled when she saw them. “M.K., Boom, it’s been a while!”

They exchanged hugs, catching up on their past adventures and exchanging updates. The atmosphere was light and filled with laughter, despite the tense reason Yuri was in Havenbrook—to track down Carmella.

Elsewhere in Havenbrook City, Lady Hunter moved stealthily through different areas, looking for any signs of Carmella. She kept in constant contact with Yuri and Jennifer, who were also on the lookout, each of them trying to piece together any clues about Carmella’s whereabouts.

Jennifer had split from the group and was combing through a different part of town, carefully asking questions and trying to dig up anything that might lead them to Carmella. The three of them were determined, staying in close communication to coordinate their efforts.

# Back in Havenbrook

In Havenbrook, the tension was much lighter. Sonya and Emiru were in the middle of an epic video gaming war in their apartment, with Cinna and Jenna watching. The screen flashed with bright colors, and the two gamers shouted at each other, both competitive and determined to win. Cinna cheered them on, while Jenna laughed, enjoying the friendly chaos of it all.

Across town, Lyra held a meeting at Thea and Ivy's Bakery. The bakery was cozy, filled with the smell of fresh bread and sweets. Liv, Rihanna, Michelle, and Tatum all gathered around a table as Lyra laid out some notes in front of her.

“Thanks for coming, everyone,” Lyra began. “We need to talk about what’s been going on in Havenbrook lately. There’s too much happening for it to be just coincidence.”

They all nodded in agreement, exchanging looks. Michelle spoke up, “We need to figure out what’s causing all this and how to deal with it.”

Tatum added, “The recent events are definitely connected. We need a plan if we want to get ahead of it.”

The conversation continued, ideas exchanged as they sipped on coffee and shared pastries. They all knew the stakes were high, but together, they felt more prepared to face whatever was coming.

# Shakira's Club

At Shakira’s club, the atmosphere was far more relaxed. The music was pumping, and C.C. was there, enjoying herself. She sipped on a drink as she leaned against the bar, chatting with Jazzy, who was also there, just chilling and taking in the scene.

“Nice to just take a breather, right?” Jazzy said, giving C.C. a smile.

“Definitely,” C.C. agreed. “Especially with all the chaos lately. It’s good to just... let loose a little.”

They clinked their glasses, both of them enjoying the moment of calm in the middle of everything that had been happening.

# Judy Álvarez's Place

Over at Judy Álvarez’s place, she and Alinity were spending time together, just enjoying each other's company. The two had grown close, and their bond was becoming stronger with each day. Judy still felt a little unsure about dating Alinity, nervous about taking that next step, but the way they clicked was undeniable.

They spent the evening laughing and talking, both happy just to be with one another.

# NJPW Style Wrestling Event

Judy Álvarez and Janie Styles had finally finished setting up the NJPW-style wrestling event. They were excited to see who would show up. Both of them knew that this event was not only a way to entertain but also a means to draw out people who they didn’t recognize—people who might be involved in the strange occurrences in Havenbrook.

# Alexa's Place

Alexa sat down with Hendra and Andreja once again, ready to continue their conversation. “Thanks for coming back, both of you,” Alexa said, giving them a warm smile. “I know last time was a lot, but it’s important for us to talk this through.”

Hendra nodded, and Andreja sighed, looking determined to continue their journey of healing.

“We're ready,” Andreja said, her eyes meeting Alexa’s. It was clear they were both committed to understanding their past and finding a way forward.

1ku1cp6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ku1cp6,Nolli lived a great life,"This will be a lot of a rant. Not sure if it’s allowed here but I need to get this off of my chest. 

She was a rescue, one of our family dogs for 9 years. She came from a bad place, a breeder used her for litters only to throw her on the side of the street after. I remember the day she came home. She was so nervous, it took months but we were gentle and patient. It paid off so well. She was the most selfless dog I’ve ever met. So gentle and not a single drop of bad blood in her. We had so many adventures together. She was my escape and reason to get out of the house when I needed to. We’d go on walks or drives to the pond and my god did she love to swim. 

Her brother Macs passed in 2022. That was the single worst day of my life and I’ve been through a lot. He was my puppy, he was a rescue and a gift from my older sister, he was 10. Unfortunately the person who birthed me, let’s call her H, took away my grieving process from me. She hid his sickness and it took three years for me to find out he was cremated. I still don’t know where he is, I still can’t find a collar or tag of his for myself to hold onto. Monty was before, my true childhood dog. I was very young when he passed. He was sick and, you guessed it, she didn’t tell anyone until it was too late. 

Just quick context, I have no good history with H. She’s abused me all my life, I’ve never forgiven her for nor do I respect her. When she hid Macs from me…. I haven’t healed from it since. Don’t think I ever will. I never got to say goodbye. (Plus, she got a dog to “replace” him 4 months after. She swore he “sent her for H to heal” except her new dog Macy is the least like Macs and only caused a lot of problems in the house and family).

It’s relevant because she’s just done the same thing to me with Nolli. Luckily my father was there to tell me she was being rushed to the emergency vet. I woke up and it was the first thing I see, so I rushed out of the house (I live with my boyfriend now about 40-50 minutes away) and begged the entire time for her to confirm the hospital she was at. I cried the entire way there. She calls me when I’m 10 minutes away and tells me I have to say goodbye. 

The whole time there was horrible. I couldn’t grieve her, I couldn’t say goodbye. I spent any longer than 2 minutes holding Nolli, I’m being pushed away because it’s “her turn”. H didn’t even want to wait until my dad got there. I just wanted to hold her. The doctor comes in and explains to me why Nolli is here. Apparently my poor girl had cancer in her liver and she fell sick/limp that morning because of internal bleeding (?). Apparently H knew this for a week or two. She didn’t tell anybody, she didn’t accept medication for Nolli. She let her suffer during her last week. She knew and she didn’t tell me so that I could come home and spend her last days with her. Give her her last treat or peanut butter spoon. Last car ride to get coffee and a pup cup, last trip to the park, last bathe in the sun, cuddle, play, belly rub. It could have all been peaceful and scheduled for her. 

Nolli was being put down and H had her entire body wrapped around her the whole time, blocking me. I watched from a distance. I wanted to hold her too. I deserved to hold her too. I watched her eyes.

I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be so vulnerable. I had to sneak one of her collars home with me or else I wouldn’t have heard the end of it. God. I just can’t grieve right. I’ve been such a mess and it’s been a week. I can’t stop crying. I can’t stop being mad at H. I just don’t understand it. I feel forced to process through this anger before I can celebrate Nolli’s life. I just want to grieve. ",10,1748054533.0,dogpictures,0,1.0,False

No one on FB really cares about my hysterectomy. I don’t know anyone on there who gets the struggle to be listened to instead of dismissed, actually diagnosed and have a doctor willing to do a hysterectomy without a fight. I hope this helps someone in some way! If you are reading this because you are healing or you are scared to have a hysterectomy… you can do scary things. It will all work out in the end ❤️

4/23/25 - I made it through surgery. It was intense—truly unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. I’m sore, groggy, and in a lot of pain, but I’m alive ❤️Anesthesia felt like a fever dream, and I’m still not all the way here 😵‍💫🥴 Recovery is going to be a journey, and I’m just taking it one breath at a time. Grateful for the care I received and asking for prayers as I heal 🙏🏼

4/25/25 - ⚠️ Hysterectomy Recovery: Day 2 ⚠️

No amount of internet research—and I did a lot—could’ve prepared me for this pain. It feels like I’ve been cut in half, butchered, ripped open by a chainsaw. Everyone said the first two hours post-op were the most dangerous, and that I probably wouldn’t remember them. They were right—I don’t. Now I’m at the two-day mark. Still early, still vulnerable, still in absolute agony 😮‍💨 But, every day further out from surgery without suffering a risk or complication is a good day 🙌🏼

Is everything healing? God, I hope so. It feels like I’ve just been wounded, not recovering from one. Is the pain manageable? Barely. Percocet every four hours is just taking the edge off, but this is a type of pain I’ve never known before. On top of that, I’m fighting a fever, a urinary tract infection that started right after surgery, and thick phlegm from being intubated. Trying to cough that up to avoid pneumonia when your abdomen has been butchered is a nightmare 😩🥺

But… small victories. Urinary function has returned. I had my first bowel movement. I’m able to get out of bed, walk to the bathroom, and eat a little something. I can shower by myself. These are trophy worthy wins at this point 🏆

My 17-year-old daughter has been my angel. She slept beside me, woke up with me throughout the night, helped me in and out of bed, on and off the toilet, brought me meds, held my hand. I don’t have words for how grateful I am for her care and her presence 🩷

Please send prayers 🙏🏼 I feel absolutely wrecked, but I’m thankful for what I can do and the love that’s surrounding me. This is the hardest thing I’ve ever done physically—and I’m doing it 💪🏼

5/3/25 - First day outside since my hysterectomy, and there’s no better way to spend it than soaking up this Saturday with my girls. Grateful for healing, sunshine, and the sweet joy of being with them. I wasn’t sure we would be able to handle such a major surgery and recovery without another adult around to help us, but as always, we’re figuring it out together ❤️

5/4/25 - Sipping coffee while cooking breakfast this morning felt like a quiet miracle. I’m moving slower these days, healing with grace—but there’s something sacred about returning to the rhythm of feeding the people I love ❤️

5/7/25 - 💛 Two Weeks Post-Op 💛

I drove for the first time today. It wasn’t the most comfortable ride, but I did it, and I felt like me again while doing it 🥲

My pathology and follow-up with my doctor today confirmed what I already knew: it was never normal to live in that much pain. I had chronic cervicitis, cysts on everything, endometrial hyperplasia, adenomyosis, endometriosis, and pelvic adhesion disease. The silver lining? No cancer, and most of the organs causing my pain are now gone. That alone made every bit of this worth it 🙌🏼

The biggest post surgery risks are behind me. The pain is down to discomfort. My bladder and bowels work, thank God, but I’m still swollen, hormonal, and wiped out. I move slowly but frequently. The goal is still to rest and recover ❤️‍🩹

Also—fun fact: when your ovaries go into shock, no deodorant on Earth can help you 😅 I’m hoping that’s temporary🤞🏼

Healing is weird 🥴 It’s gross, hard, emotional, funny, and empowering all at once. But I’m doing it. Day by day 🙏🏼❤️

5/23/25 - 💛 One Month Post-Hysterectomy 💛

One month ago, I could barely move and didn’t know how I would survive the pain.

Today, I can bend down, sit in a chair, shave my legs, cook, walk semi long distances, and I’m back to working full-time. I feel like a warrior goddess 💪🏼

Recovery is lonely 😌 But here’s what I know: God carried me through it 🙏🏼 Prayer and Bible study kept me grounded when my body and mind were struggling ❤️

This is your reminder that you can do scary things. You can do the things that seem impossible at first 🙌🏼

One month down 🫱🏻‍🫲🏼

I’m still healing, still swollen, I get tired quickly, but I’m upright. I’m functioning. Things are improving by the day. I’m coming back to life ❤️‍🩹",6,1748054498.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

(Perhaps someone who struggles with fasts over 72 hours can benefit from my many experiments). 

So hold on to your depends and let me tell you what I found out a couple days back:

**My credentials:**  
Been fasting for 5 years on and off. (since 2020, thanks covid)  
Usually 3-5 day fasts. Longest fast was 6 days long.  
Done omad for years, done adf for months.  
I've rolled and unfold all the fasts. 

**During those extended fasts:**  
After day 3, life was always miserable: Horrible sleep. Cramping legs, low energy, low mood and awful hunger, always wanting to break after 72 hours, and pushing to get to 120).

  
**What's happening now?**  
Currently, I'm on day 7 of an open-ended fast, but... I'm feeling none of the above.

\-  On day 4 of this fast, I was feeling miserable - as usual- hungry and tired and I decided... why not add a little of ***milk*** to my coffee?

Lo and behold, it fixed everything. Zero hunger, zero misery. No cramps, good night sleep. Unheard of until now for a day 4 and beyond sleep.

  
Next day I felt perfect. Full of energy! (impossible!)  At night, I did the same, milk in coffee. The clarity of mind, energy and no-hunger continued. I don't know what to attribute this to. 

In the past, I had tried to extend fasts with vinegar, pickle juice, zero carb sodas (this is the worst idea ever for me), miso soup... unsuccessfully. Each of these would lead to 'ok, I'm hungry, let's eat'.

But milk... it fixed everything. 

I sleep well! No cramps! I have energy!

And YES, I take my electrolytes as recommended since always. In the past, I had up them a ton and nothing worked! I was always miserable by day 4. Before milk, I'd be cramping in the legs and having terrible sleep. Low energy, low mood. It never went away with just the electrolytes, coffee, vitamins, water and tea.

  
BTW -> We're talking 100-150ml of super low fat milk (around ***50-60 cals a day***), per day.

  
A few things I attribute this to:   
1. Phosphorus: For whatever reason, I can't find phosphorus as a supplement where I live and milk has phosphorus. Phosphorus is needed to make energy and what I'm having of milk is like 30% of the needed phosphorus per day (a lot more than the 0% my body had always gotten during fasts)

Alternatively, it's those 3g of carbs that go straight to the brain and other vital organs that can't feed off ketones.

So this is something ***between a dirty fast and a mimicking diet.*** (none of my vitamins have crazy calories, i don't take omega-3s . I did that in the past, it also didn't help.) I have maybe 20 cals of vitamins and 60 cals max from the milk per day)

  
The rest is normal: water, black coffee, tea, electrolytes as suggested.

  
I ALSO DON'T HAVE THE RUNS ANYMORE! You'd think the carbs in the milk would fuck you up? You would be wrong! I had a normal (NORMAL! but small) bowel movement after 2 days of the milk experiment.

Idk man, I feel like I've cracked a code. Found a magic key to extended fasting.

Life is good. If you struggle to extend your fast, can I recommend a little milk in your coffee before going to bed?

  
Also, if you have phosphorus in your vitamins, I would love to read in the replies what your experience with extended fasting has been. ",2,1748054337.0,fasting,4,1.0,False

I’m also posting because listening to her videos really helped me find my own closure & stop caring so much what others may think of this situation. I am changing names in this on the off chance someone I know reads it. Now buckle up cause this one is long & dramatic.

Background info: my best friend since 5th grade, let’s call her Becky & I have been through all the things together. We managed the weird transition from private school to public school together, we thankfully ended up at the same public high school. But we actually did not hang out at school together, like at all. We are so opposites attract type of friendship. Becky was the peppy extroverted cheerleader, while I was the quieter sporty one & did pretty much everything I could to not be in the popular crowd. She dated my brother fairly seriously in high school, that did NOT end well, but we still managed to keep our sister like friendship. She was there for me while I navigated getting married very young & being a military wife, she supported me when I became a mom. I gave her pep talks through the terrible dating & encouraged her in her schooling & later career goals. I drove 10 hours to spend a too short weekend with her when her mom passed far too young. She held my hand, wrote my bio, & took my pictures when I was finally ready to date again after a VERY messy divorce. In short we were each other’s rock. 

Fast forward to us as 28 year olds. It’s Halloween & unfortunately I am a last minute person (I know, believe me I have tried to change that, but I have now just accepted that that’s who I am). Becky being my best friend, she did a lot of holiday stuff with my daughter & I. So all 3 of us are running a quick errand at the store before getting ready for tick or treating with my then 6 year old. As we’re walking around the store looking for the things we need I notice a man following us, when I first noticed him I saw him say something to Becky. However my daughter & I were too far ahead of them to hear what he said. & at first he just walked by after he said something, but then he came back & started blatantly following us, saying things along the lines of they better get their stuff back. At this point I don’t remember exactly what was said, but I do remember it was language & things that I would not want my 6 year old to over hear. This man made it very clear he would be following us when we left. Somehow my daughter didn’t catch on, I will forever thank my lucky stars for me being able to make up stupid songs about whatever we’re doing because that was what kept her focus & entertained while this was happening. Now my dad was a cop, & while this was scary, I was raised both confident & competent. So when we got to the check out I informed Becky that she needed to talk to security at the store & call the police. That she would not be coming to my car with us because I would not be putting my daughter in danger like that, nor would I let him follow us to my house, but i told her that I wouldn’t leave until security was there. I told her to call me once the police had taken care of things & the man was gone. At this point I was completely clueless as to wtf was going on, but what I did know was I’d be damned if whatever it was would affect my daughter. So after all of this is taken care of & my kid is happily running from door to door getting as much candy as she can carry, Becky tells me her story. To this day I don’t know if this story is true, but I strongly suspect it’s not the whole truth. The man following us was an acquaintance of Becky’s ex. This particular ex & Becky were together for several years & they did a damn good job of just emotionally annihilating each other, both cheated & on & on. But not the point. The point is she was still friends with this ex. She had let him barrow her car at one point. & apparently when he had her car he decided to go to that acquaintance’s house & steal a whole bunch of stuff, like all the expensive tech things, big screen TV, stereo equipment, laptops, the works. Becky said she had no idea until the guy was following us around. At the time I took it at face value & commiserated on what a sh*t human being her ex is. But looking back she was careful to just say things like what a terrible thing for him to do & I don’t know what he was thinking. 
So I let this go & we continue on with life. Becky’s now dating someone new, they moved in together really quick if you ask me but she was happy so whatever right. So it’s summer, school is out & baby sitters are expensive. So Becky being the bestie babysits for me  as often as she can. Something comes up & she can’t babysit for me but she says the boyfriend is happy to do it. Now my daughter has met him several times & she seems to like him well enough, but I’m unsure cause that’s my baby. But I had to go to a gyno DRs appointment & that was not one I was willing to bring a curious 7 year old to. So I trust my best friend & have the boyfriend watch her. 
Now fast forward a few months & I buy a new car, & am selling my old one. The boyfriend wants to buy it so I say ok. I sign it over & I file the release of liability, this is important. 
Fast forward another few months & they’ve broken up & bestie is moving into a new place. She was stressed about the move because her deposit ended up being quite a bit more money than she had, I tell her I feel bad but unfortunately I can’t help as I didn’t have that much either & she already owed me some money, a few days later she’s fine & when I ask about it she says she’s figured it out. Ok cool whatever I’m glad it worked out. 
Now fast forward a few more months. I get a notice in the mail about my old car being impounded & owing a RIDICULOUS amount of money. So I’m confused & I call the number on the notice & in the end I just had to share the last known contact info I have for Becky’s ex & I’m off the hook because I had filed the release of liability. But I’m confused too, & I tell Becky about it, she reaches out to the ex but can’t get ahold of him. 
A few weeks pass & my dad calls me. In between the time we talked about the car issue & my dad calling I had learned more about what had been going on, enough to really see the puzzle pieces were not fitting, so I’m already uneasy with things. 
Now for my dad, he can be scary he’s a retired cop & you can tell, & my step mom is Italian & sweet until you mess with her loved ones. 
So dad calls & asks what I’m doing, as fate would have it I’m literally on my way to meet Becky for coffee. He asks where we are meeting because he needs to talk to her. So I tell him & he says don’t let her know I’m coming but I’ll meet you there. So we’re sitting outside with out coffee just chatting. When I see my dad heading our way I notice my step mom is also with him, & when Becky notices them coming her face drops. 
So they sit with us & confront Becky. Turns out the deposit money she didn’t have, she got the money from my dad with the caveat that she pays him back in full over the next month, so half of what’s owed from her each of her next 2 checks. As you can guess she did not pay him back. The main points of their convo, my dad telling her she will pay me back first cause what was she thinking borrowing money from a single mother, then she will pay him back, every pay check we get $200 until she has paid it all back or he would waste a few thousand dollars just to teach her the lesson the hard way by taking her to small claims court & making sure she got served while she was at work. My step mother made it clear in no uncertain terms that she was no longer welcome at their home for any reason other than dropping money off. They apologized to me for the surprise & left. 
So that left us in a quiet awkward silence for all for 30 seconds before I very calmly, with the quiet rage of a protective mother that should make people literally wonder if they will survive this encounter, demanded answers. Why didn’t she tell me she got money from my dad? ( which I will say girls got balls, cause honestly I would rather make money selling feet pics than ask my dad for money, the man is scary) I also demanded answers about the things that didn’t make sense. I never thought I’d be one of those people that says “how dare you” in an argument. But I definitely said how dare you put my daughter in potential danger. It turned out the ex that stole stuff, she was hanging out with him, had him in her car, while she was picking my daughter up from daycare & babysitters. & this was after the man following us, knowing that guy was on the lookout for her ex. She also shared that the more recent ex that I had let babysit my daughter, he was selling drugs, which she knew & did not tell me & that he was in jail & thats why the car was impounded. She also stated she was in gamblers anonymous & that’s why she was having so much money issues. She cried & wanted to know how to fix things. Assured me she would never hurt my daughter. I lost my sh*t, out of everything she said I only got excuses from her, she never apologized for what she did. I never thought she would hurt her, but driving around with a man who should have been in jail is her decision, but it is NOT her decision to make to drive around with him & my daughter in the car. I told her I couldn’t even begin to try to mend our friendship until she figured her sh*t out. 
 You would think that’s the end of the story. It’s not. 
A little over a year passes & I miss my best friend, so I reach out. We agree to meet for brunch & catch up. At brunch she looks so different, I mean she looks healthy & happy. She tells me how therapy has been going, she’s been going to gamblers anonymous regularly since we stopped talking, she’s started working out again & feels better than she has in ages. She’s talking to some of her family that she had always had a pretty rocky relationship with. All in all it seems like she really took everything that happened to heart & has been putting in the work to make herself better. & I’m ecstatic, we can start working on our friendship again. She also starts telling me she’s been seeing a new guy. This was a guy her mother had worked with & had tried to set her up with back when she was still alive. This man has not a job, but a career. He has goals & is actively working towards those goals. In short, the first man she’s actually dated & someone who can help lift her up & push her to do better. So time passes & our friendship is mending. My daughter is happy her Auntie Becky is back & watching them almost pee their pants laughing together while using the silly filters on Snapchat literally warmed my cold heart. As time passes her current boyfriend gets sent out of the country for several months for work. It’s rough but they are powering through, & I’m there with all the extra girl nights to help her through. Then one day she tells me she’s met another guy, & I warn her that nothing good will come of this & it’s a slippery slope back to bad choices. But she ends up cheating. The one she cheated with, she ends up dating, which again I caution her that nothing good will come because he knew she was in a relationship & pursued her anyway. But she’s happy & so far nothing else seems like she’s back to bad old habits so I speak my piece & move on. Months later the anniversary of her mother’s death comes around & he is supposed to spend it with her because she understandably is always really depressed around that time. He calls her in the middle of the night, literally the night before the anniversary, saying there’s a family emergency & he’s got to fly back home. She understands & I spend the time with her. Turns out there was no emergency, he went to HAWAII with another girl & cheated. Becky is devastated. Cuts him out & he is just nonstop trying to win her back. Showing up at her work unannounced bringing her coffee & snacks & anything he can to keep her mind on him. Eventually the trying to win her back seems to die down. & a few months later it’s her birthday. Now we still see each other all the time & are always talking. So I text her on her actual birthday to say happy birthday & ask what time she wants to go to dinner, taking each other on a birthday dinner date has looooong been our tradition. She responds that she’s out of town but will let me know as soon as she’s back. I’m surprised cause we had talked the other day & she didn’t say anything about going anywhere. So I ask something along the lines of oh last minute birthday trip, where did you go. & she tells me the cheaters hometown. So I responded with if you went with cheater’s name, I will disown you lol. Cause really, how could anyone have so little respect for themselves that they forgive someone skipping the anniversary of your mother’s death, just so they can go on a tropical vacation & cheat on you. Honestly I was half kidding when I said it, but there was a part of me that knew her forgiving him would be an issue. How could I want someone for my best friend that would treat her that way. Not to mention how much I hate cheating. But then she responded with that’s fine, I’m doing what makes me happy. & that was when I truly realized that our friendship never meant to her what it did to me. & that our opposites attract that made us so close when we were young, that for us it meant we had grown to be so different with different morals that we were no longer compatible as friends. & I haven’t spoken to her since. That text was about 4 years ago now. & I’ve often wondered if I was wrong. But therapy & listening to these stories has helped me get more clarity. I grieved that friendship more than I did my marriage. But in the end I know I’m better off, because my peace is too important to invite that kind of drama seeking toxicity into my life. I now choose to surround myself with people whose actions show me they are a good person, rather than holding onto what was simply because of the length of time spent with someone.

He must have open reddit in my computer. Pray for me that he doesn't find out.  
  
I know the tittle sounds dramatic but hear me out. I'm a 23 year-old non binary person that is a bit tired and anxious about their situation. For a bit of context; I'm just finishing a part of my studies and have to decide if I want to keep on going studying or if I wanna work. Lots of changes are going to happen and I'm starting to put my relationship in question...

I've been with the same guy for 4 and a half years, and our relantionship up to this point hasn't been bad, but maybe not as good as I always paint it. I do kinda feel stuck to him. He's a politician and has great grades in university, very admired in the comunities he participates in, some sort of prodogy some would say. I know he's looking for the same things in the future as me (House, marriage, kids...) and I value that 'cause is not that common to have it so crystal clear this days. He's a land owner and could easily get a good paying job in a couple of years, meaning that we could even think of moving in together while I'm still studying/I'm working a low paying job. Also, I'm afraid I might loose some closeness to my friends if I break up with him... We did in 2023 for a month and it was my lonliest time in a few years. He can be kind of needy and he basicly required our whole friend group 24/7.

As you can see, my ""reasons for staying"" are not the best. I want a good husband and I want to keep being close with my friends and all, but I'm so young... Maybe it feels like the life I have now would be destoyed but... Maybe it's fine? I've got time to rebuild it.

I do genuingly love him and enjoy his company a lot, we have a lot of taste in common, but he's the only bf I've had and I feel like my live is so much settled than what I want now. I wanna explore new people, new possibilities. He's also not the ""perfect boyfriend"", not that I am the perfect partner. He gets angry easily, sometimes agressive (he has never laid a finger on me if that is your concern), he's extremely jelous and a bit careless with my feelings. I usually think he's very inmmature for a guy in his position, his mother (who is a total demonic abuser, to be fair) still does everything for him: laundry, cleaning his room, making his meals... Even when he wants a coffee, he asks his mom. I just get the feeling my mother in law just goes along with this to keep him closer, so that she can play her mindgames, screaming matches and costant belitteling and insults. To sumorise, he doesn't make me feel loved, or heard, or important, nor desired... I'm just the doll he's suposed to flaunt in political gatherings and be at his side, always supportive but never asking to much from him.

Also, I'm getting the feeling his reactions to dissagriments and stuff are not that okay. Apart from the obvious agressive behaviour. Whenever I say I need to talk about something, whatever it may be, sometimes he isn't even involved, he always jumps to saying that I'm going to leave and starts acting sad and (I HATE to say it like this) like a ""victim"". English is not my first language. I sometimes try to break up with him, but he starts crying and begging, saying he's nothing without me and that he's gonna fall into depression. I admit I've wanted to leave before, but backed from it because of this. There's been times when he's physicly grabbed onto me, wich kind of scares me. He scares me a lot, actually. I've had a lot of bad expiriencies with men, especially sexual, physical and emotional abuse. I'm tall, but I'm really thin and he's taller, bigger, really strong actually. He's built like a tank tbh.

Why has this all come to a boiling point? Well, a couple of days ago we were ""play fighting"" and i tried to tickle him. He was already a bit steamy because of something that happened is his political life. He was doing his usual joke of pinning me down, saying that he's so much stronger than me and stuff (I'm not particularly bothered by it, it has acutally become even something sexual to us sometimes), and I tickled him. He flipped out. He even put his hand up and said that ""I will struck you"" as a way of telling me to stop. I froze. I got majorly triggered and he started to be very apologetic, but this has changed how I see everything. Like my mind is constantly running with the same ""He wouldn't... Would he?"". Logicly he wouldn't, but this has hurt me enough to not see logic.

Other relevant points that I don't know how to include:  
\- He's help me like no other with my mental health and stability, with my eating disorder too.  
\- He has gone to a therapist abour his anger management issues, but stopped going before he got everything under control.  
\- Lately, he's been very ocupied with his political career and has been ignoring me for the most part.  
\- He's insanely caring, very affectionate, encouraging, genuingly takes care of me.  
\- We are very compatible in bed and he's very comforting with my triggers and stuff during it.  
\- I do feel like he think highly of me, maybe too much. That is a mixed bag for me. On one hand, It's nice to have someone that loves you very much and speaks highly of you to others, but I do feel like he's obssesed sometimes.

Sorry if some points feel like contradictions, but I do feel the situations has a lot of those, wich doesn't help to navegate it. What should I do? And how? I just feel like no matter what I do I'm going to have to rebuild everything anyways, because if I stay with him, clearly it can't be like this.

MA was much more laid back with two low key days sandwiching a day at MANP in between. We went with a guided tour for it as well.

For the time we had, it was perfect. I’m more of a laid back vacationer, so doing more activities in the beginning of the trip was nice. I honestly didn’t find any of where we went or what we did as too touristy. But we also did the earliest tours in the day and used week days for them as much as possible. 

The only downside of the trip was the first day because I have awful motion sickness. Our drive from San Jose to LF was so windy and bumpy. I had all of the medicines I could take, but I still had to get sick on the side of the road.

So now, to cap it off, I'm reading reviews on these new Peanut Butter Pie mini cups, and people are saying some wild stuff about them. They taste like coffee, black licorice, have a disgusting smell, among other things. I'm not even gonna bother trying them based off this.

-Didn’t have to wait a SECOND in the merch line!

-This was the most time I’ve ever spent at the local stage. Battlemode and Megan From Work both have a great sound but the vocals for both were strained

-Sheryl Crow was fantastic but too many Megan Maroney fans who wanted to loudly talk and ignore her ruined it for me 

-Who knew T-Pain would be the best set of the entire day!

-I try to keep an open mind, and I like festivals because I see things I don’t normally see. The “bro-country” stereotype is something I try not to give any cadence to. Even if the amount of dudes rocking camo, wraparound sunglasses, and miller lite cowboy hats was comical, I’m sure they’re all nice guys. However, I was super bummed during Future Teens. The lead singer was saying some impassioned and very true words about Trans rights, and a few of those types of guys started going crazy, giving the middle finger, talking so much shit, and essentially validating all the bad things they say about country fans. Hate to see it, especially at music festivals which to me are about joy and love of all music.

Then, right at the ""end"" of COVID -- when many big companies had already started implementing various forms of RTO -- my company buckled. They apparently decided that the previous 10 years of SOLID GODDAM PROOF that WFH can and does work (and that we don't need to be in person to collaborate well, and we certainly don't need your ""culture"" bullshit) was wrong. (Hmm...maybe shareholders should sue for all the lost ""productivity in those ~12 years?)  

My manager is pro-WFH, so he delayed me having to go in as long as he could, but today I finally had to bite the bullet and trudge in. I more or less purposely picked the Friday before a 3DW so I could ""ease into"" one of the negatives about WFH: All the other people milling about, making noise and small talk and smells and various other distractions. 

So I drove 45 minutes in (normally 25 minutes but OF COURSE there was an accident on my first day back) to sit at a desk and communicate with my team via email, Teams messages, and Teams calls. You know, EXACTLY HOW I DO IT FROM HOME. Did I mention nobody on my team is in my office?

IMO, the proof that they're blatantly lying about the collaboration/culture crap comes from the following logic:  
1-They, like many, have an exception for employees living more than X miles from an office (we're mostly nation-wide).  
2-#1 proves they can/will make exceptions.  
3-An obvious exception SHOULD be people (like me) who have ZERO team members (you know, those with whom we **collaborate**) in our local office. If in-person collaboration was really the main goal, why **make** those people go in?  
4-They (meaning mine and most companies) very quickly realized that a lot of their workers are in that remote-collab-only exception group, but didn't want to make an exception so they tacked ""and culture"" onto the end. Fuck you. Try to tell me that the ""culture"" at a widget counting office in Boise is anything close to the ""culture"" at an internal auditing office in Miami. 


Luckily, my manager has said they're only tracking badge-ins so while he says ""no coffee badging"", he's OK with going home at lunch... which cuts the chances of commute-related bullshit in half.

Let me say I love this community of people you are all lovely potatoes!

To get started I (f, mid-20s, Hungarian) have been in a long-distance relationship with a man (also mid-20s,Chinese) for 8 months.

For concept we both live in England. He is London based and I'm 40 mins away from him.

 At first, everything felt affectionate and warm. We made time to talk and check in, and I genuinely cared for him. But over the past two to three months, he became emotionally distant, and I began to feel like I was trying to maintain something he had quietly given up on.
I suggested meeting multiple times—especially over long weekends and bank holidays—but he always made other plans, usually with his friends. I even offered to bring over homemade sourdough bread and spend quality time, but he’d either ignore or say he was busy. I stayed kind, supportive, and tried to check in emotionally, but he was clearly pulling away.
Two weeks ago, I called him, and we spoke on FaceTime. He looked burdened and tired. I gently asked what was going on and said I noticed he seemed distant. He told me he didn’t want to talk about it and added, “You wouldn’t understand anyway.” I respected that and backed off—I didn’t want to push him if he wasn’t ready to share.
Then out of nowhere, he reached out and said we “needed to talk about us.” On the call, he said:
“I don’t see a future with us. I just don’t feel like we resonate. With the people around me, they just connect naturally. There’s no need to explain or spend much time—it just works.”
That was the first time he ever mentioned his friends’ relationships. I was shocked. I told him: how can we know if we truly connect or not, when we’ve barely spent meaningful time together lately? I said relationships take effort, communication, and presence—not instant alignment through distance and silence.
He disagreed and said people who are “meant to be” should just feel it, even without needing to talk deeply or see each other often.

He also said the way I supported him through struggles didn’t feel right—that he doesn’t want “nice words,” he wants “solutions.” But he never once told me how I could support him differently. In addition for the first time in our time together he mentioned of trauma? How he carrys it with him but wouldn't go in details.

When I say I opinions and reflections iver his behaviour of overwoking and egoism he replied with
“That just confirms we’re not meant to be.” ( Just for details he emphasised the need of deep talks of our individuality and behaviour.)

He would sometimes make me feel less tjan him, saying things like “You went to university and don’t know this?” if I didn’t recognize a name or topic.

He also said I’m “too nice,” possibly because of my culture, which felt unfair. I come from a strict Hungarian upbringing. I wasn’t being fake—I was choosing to be warm and gentle early on.

Despite being together for 8 months, he never introduced me to his friends or family. He also said he didn’t feel comfortable around my family, even though he barely spent time with them. I was left feeling excluded, judged, and blamed for a connection he never gave us the space to build.

When I said I believe this is not a subject to be talked thought phone he suggested to meet for coffee this coming up Monday (a bank holiday) to “talk things through,” but I feel like he’s already emotionally checked out. He framed this breakup as a spiritual mismatch, when really he withdrew, avoided communication, and compared me to relationships of friend's he wasn’t even part of. Even though he stated to give us time to think and maybe try a bit more?

I feel like there is so much more to add but it is 3 am here and my brain is dead.
I will most likely meet up just to see where this go and what other nonsense this man have to say.

So… AITA for choosing to walk away from someone who stopped trying long ago? ",11,1748052134.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,5,1.0,False

My wife, who is not only a ridiculously talented photographer but also far more patient than I deserve, is still clinging to an ancient 27"" iMac I bought her around 2012. That iMac itself was an upgrade from an *even older* iMac, so we’re talking about a machine that probably still remembers the Obama administration… the *first* one.

Recently, she’s started mentioning that it’s slow. And by ""mentioning"" I mean the polite, slowly-simmering frustration that only a decade-plus-old computer can summon. Frankly, I’m amazed it’s still booting at all—it’s probably running on stubbornness and coffee fumes at this point.

So I want to surprise her with a shiny new machine. She’s *all in* on macOS. No judgment—I’ve been building PCs since the dinosaurs roamed, but my Mac knowledge is about as deep as a kiddie pool in a drought. I’m not going to try to convert her. I’ve accepted that this is the life I chose. Or rather, the life that chose me.

I was eyeing a new MacBook Pro (because it’s 2025 and apparently the iMacs now look like oversized iPads on a stick), but I’m not sure she’d love going from her giant 27” screen to a 16” laptop. Then again, she rocked several PowerBook G4s back in the day, so maybe she’s got it in her.

So, to all of you in the know:  
What would *you* do if you wanted to give your wife a buttery-smooth editing experience, didn’t want to make her eyes bleed from tiny screen syndrome (or maybe you do?), and were allergic to spending $7,000 unless it made you coffee and folded your laundry?

My 7-year-old daughter, Jane, finally came to check on me, but my husband Bob (34M) did not. I was yelling so loudly that Jane got scared and started crying. I managed to calm her down and asked her to go get my compression socks. She brought them to me, and when I bent my leg to put one on, my thigh started cramping so tightly I screamed again and writhed in pain. Nothing I did would stop it.

I finally asked Jane to go get Bob from the living room. He massaged my thigh with diclofenac gel, heated up my microwaveable pillow to help my muscles, and helped me put on the socks. Then they both went back to the living room. Jane brought me water, and I drank about a liter. She came to ask if I wanted ice cream, and Bob made some for all of us. Jane brought mine to me.

I sat up and ate it. Later, I had to pee badly from all the water and was able to get up without another cramp. I went to sit in the living room with them for a bit.

I asked Bob why he hadn’t come to check on me when I was screaming and crying. He said he heard me but didn’t come. I asked what he was doing during that time—he said he was playing solitaire on his phone. I asked if he would’ve come if I’d called his name. He said he would have.

I’m confused. It’s not like it’s normal for me to scream like that. I have an extremely high pain tolerance, and I was screaming like I did during labor with pitocin and no meds. I feel really disenchanted with my whole life right now.

⸻

I’m asking AIO, but I know I probably am. I have ADHD and rejection sensitive dysphoria. I feel right now like he never loved me and my whole life is a lie. I know that’s an overreaction, but I do have a right to be a little upset, right?

——
As far as why I am getting leg cramps like that - I wore heels today and walked a lot in them, which I don’t normally do, AND I drank nothing but coffee and energy drinks all day and had no water. I got sweaty and hot today walking outside.. in heels.. and had no water until I realized dehydration was probably part of why I was having cramps as I lay writhing in pain. It was a very busy day, and I should have drank water. ",15,1748051518.0,AIO,32,0.94,False
1ku0fxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_aPoetinaTurn/comments/1ku0fxd/the_masterstroke/,The Masterstroke,"Okay.
Okay okay okay.
This is it. The masterstroke. The Final Move. The Grand Romantic Gesture that will make every Nicholas Sparks novel look like a tax manual. Cecilia is going to lose her mind. In the good way.

So here’s the blueprint: I’m going to get her on Reddit.
Not directly, no no no—she’d get spooked. She’s elegant. She wears linen in public. But if I drop just the right kind of breadcrumbs (indirectly quoting her in a coffee shop, referencing something obscure she likes like fermented blueberries or Belgian nihilist cartoons), she’ll eventually stumble into r/UnsentLetters.

That’s where the plan flowers open.

Because what Cecilia won’t know at first—and this is the part where it gets genius—is that I’ve already written to her.
A lot.
Like, thousands.
A million and one, actually. I made sure to stop exactly there. For symmetry.

I’ve been posting nonstop, from 50 different Reddit accounts. Each with a unique personality, linguistic style, and trauma backstory. One guy lost a pelican. Another one only types in lowercase and references obscure Polish poetry. It’s a whole ecosystem of longing and nuance. A community of me’s.

The idea is that she’ll post something innocuous, like “Has anyone ever been in love with a friend and felt completely paralyzed?” and BAM. Ten replies. Me, me, me, and me, all in different voices, all tender, haunted, noble, yearning.
She’ll feel seen.
She’ll feel haunted.

And when she finally connects the dots (which she will, because she’s smart—another reason this will work), she’ll realize: Oh my god. All of these beautiful men were Todd. Todd Lang Jr. did this for me.

That’s when she’ll reach out. Probably crying. Maybe overwhelmed. But moved. And then we’ll begin our story. Our forever.

…

Except—

Okay.
So tonight I read one of my own replies aloud, just to test the effect. You know, simulate the moment. And I heard it.

I heard the… horror.

It was something like,
“i think about you when the radiator hisses.
every time the cat walks across my keyboard
i imagine it’s your spine pressing into mine,
through the screen.”
[Posted by u/spinemetaphor_1988]

And I just sat there in the dark and thought:
This is deranged.
Like truly, irreparably unwell behavior.

She’s going to open Reddit one night, bored and cozy, and find a digital mausoleum of some guy’s obsession with her. A red-string-on-the-wall-level collection of letters and usernames and passive poetry about yogurt and breath. And when she realizes it’s me, it’s not going to feel like love.
It’s going to feel like being stalked by a community theatre production of me.

She’s going to throw her phone. She’s going to tell her therapist. She’s going to say things like “I’m scared” and “He doesn’t even have a job.”

And the worst part? I don’t.
Because I’ve been busy curating a persona-based multiverse of devotion, Cecilia.

Oh God.

I might be the villain in this story.
And not even the interesting kind.
The cringe kind.

New to pickling and I live in a country where the easiest jars to get are nescafe instant coffee jars. I've had some success pickling with them if I leave very little gap between the top and pour hot water into it before screwing the lid on. Was wondering what are some maybe unorthodox containers that people have had success using in the past?

Also if someone could direct me to some sort of comprehensive guide for pickling I want to start pickling cabbage and radishes in large quantities in the near future. Is there an easy way to do this in large quantities?

Tips ?,"I recently applied for a position at one of the big banks and, to my surprise, got contacted for an in-person interview pretty quickly. The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter said I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP told me it would likely be closer to 2 weeks — so I figured I’d just wait it out.

But then the next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the **same VP again**, this time for an **informal coffee chat**. Recruiter mentioned the first interview was “only an hour” and that VP didn’t get to ask everything she wanted to. The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the vibe was much more relaxed. She asked me a lot of personal questions about my background and interests — not too much technical or role-specific talk.

At the end, she told me she still has two more candidates to speak with by the end of this week (it's Friday now, the coffee chat was before yesterday). Before we parted ways, she reminded me I have her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions.

Some context: I’ve only been working in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first position in finance **outside of retail banking**. I’m a little anxious because I don’t have much experience, so I’m trying to read between the lines here.

D'après le titre, j'ai pensé que Lady Windermere était simplement une femme très populaire et qu'elle avait beaucoup de fans. Pourtant, en lisant des critiques de cette pièce sur Goodreads, j'ai découvert que, bien que beaucoup de gens aient pensé comme moi, le *fan* de Lady Windermere voulait dire, en réalité, un éventail. 

J'ai raconté cette histoire à ma maman, qui m'a dit qu'aujourd'hui elle avait vu une annonce pour une « liste d'exercices de chaise imprimable ». Elle était restée quelques instants à essayer de comprendre ce qu'était une chaise imprimable, juste pour se rendre compte que l'on avait mis l'adjectif au mauvais endroit, et que l'intention était de dire que c'était une *liste* imprimable. 

Tandis qu'elle me racontait cela, je me suis souvenue d'un comédien qui racontait le jour où il avait demandé à sa sœur si elle avait besoin de quelque chose dans la rue. Elle a répondu « 100% iced coffee ». Il ne buvait pas de café, donc il avait imaginé que le pourcentage faisait référence à quelque chose comme du lait entier. Lorsqu'est venu son tour à Starbucks, il a commandé cela, ce qui a provoqué une réaction confuse du barista, qui a appelé son gérant. Le gérant lui a alors expliqué qu'il est impossible de faire du « 100% iced coffee » : si on met 100% de glace, il n'y a pas de place pour le café, et vice-versa.

It started with tendinitis in both hands, leading me to lose my coffee van business; next was several holes in my ankle ligament, a proper moon boot, this-is-bad injury; then my right thumb (a niggling injury that still aches and has impacted my gaming and crafts stamina significantly); several minor ankle sprains; and now we're here again, with the radiologist saying my ankle ligament looks like a 'piece of rolled up prosciutto'.

I feel like an idiot, a clutz, a child who can't control my own body. I'm constantly bumping into walls and corners, covered in bruises like I'm five years old on the quad, falling over in glee because my tiny body can't control my level of enthusiasm.

1ku0aih,https://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/1ku0aih/watch_standing_my_hours/,Watch standing - my hours,"Except when I was a dayworker at NSA I was a watch stander.

As an AG and as a CTI the sections were on duty 24/7/365. There were always four sections. One common schedule had us work: two 12 hr days, 72 hrs off, two 12 hr nights, 48 hrs off. There was a time in Misawa when we had a rotation that included 96 hours off.

When I was a 19yo AGAN stationed at North Island, I got a Suzuki TS-185 which made me available for independent duty at Outlying Field Imperial beach as a weather observer. I.B. is about 12 mi south down The Strand (Rt 75). On the border. It was a wonderful commute on my little 2-stroke. It really whined at 60 mph.

Sometimes I'd stop at Burger King for breakfast on my way in. I kept uniforms at the office. I would take my hourly weather observations, and 'specials' if the weather changed between hourlies, and lift the red phone (the Bat Phone, a direct line to N.I.) to report my observation to the observer at NavWeaServFac North Island. He would transmit it to the world. (The hourly observation was a cooperative, simultaneous, manual, worldwide effort.)  It's probably all automated now. The instruments I used are in a museum.

The field was open from 0700 - 2200. On Sundays I think it was 0800 - 1600. There were supposed to be two shifts every day except Sunday. But we didn't do it that way. One guy covered the entire day. There were three of us. I worked Mondays, Wednesdays, and every third Sunday. The field was closed on national holidays (Mondays). So there were times I worked on Wed, didn't have the Sun watch, and Monday was a holiday. A full week off! It was liberty. Not leave.

There was one time the field was closed on a Wednesday. The runway was being resurfaced and new lights were being installed. I went to Ensenada for a week. When I got back the Div Off called me in and had me sign a postdated leave request. He said, ""I would have done the same thing.""

During sunny days I would step through the big window and lay out on a lounger with my chambray shirt off and get some sun and read a paperback. I brought my own 20 foot phone cord so I could put it on the window sill.

The air traffic was mostly helos, CH-47s lifting concrete blocks from one pad to another, back and forth. Occasionally one of them would be forced to land because of a 'chip light'. That's an idiot light for a debris sensor in the gearing that could be anything from the size of a fingernail clipping to the size of your thumb. The pilots would come over for a glass of lemonade or a cup of coffee and wait. Later the mech would come over with the debris. It was usually a little sliver.

After sunset I'd go up into the tower (same building) and visit the 'tower flowers' (f). We'd take turns with the night vision scope to report the Mexicans that got onto the field.  We communicated with the sheriff, border patrol, and base security. There were a lot of parties close to the border. Once a Cobra was doing low night runs with NVDs and hit one of them. He poor guy didn't know that the last fence he crossed was to keep him off the runway. I brought my own 1911 and kept it in the desk.

I also had a stint at the Sat Van on Erdman beach near the Navy Lodge and the Marine rifle range. My watch was 48 hrs straight and I had the orbits of the sats we used. I'd show up about 30 minutes before the satellite pass to warm up the gear and align the antenna. I'd download weather satellite imagery for the west coast, develop it, print it, and use the cheap jeep to deliver it to the Forecast Duty Officer in the Air Ops Bldg. That's all I did for about six months. Except for the ETNs and the FDOs I didn't see anybody. Oh, the rifle range ... ricochets hit the van A LOT. ting. ting ting ting.

My parents were married in 1974, and they have fond memories of a 240Z from that time. The car is in a few family photos and their wedding video. They had their first date(s) and perhaps their second kiss, allegedly, in that car and they famously regret selling it. I'm the oldest of their four kids and we've heard all the stories, but it was just before our time.

Some time ago, I decided to keep my eye on the market for one. I found a listing last fall and decided to bite, and [surprise my parents on my Dad's birthday](https://youtu.be/sk-6DuIshHc) (YouTube, 1m 37sec.) It went very well, and was hard to keep a secret for \~8 months.  
  
I think the one I found is close, but has some obvious differences. It's in 112 amino alkyd enamel vs. their 019 (I suspect) ""sunshine yellow"" paint, but I frankly prefer the 112 look. It also has an L28 engine and a 5-speed gearbox. I am not sure exactly what model year my Dad got, but I'm guessing late '71 onward. They said theirs didn't have a choke, which this one does. Did they perhaps have a 1973? Any hints on model year, or frankly any insight is most appreciated!

The car I found was originally purchased in California and (I think) was one of the gold variants. It went to the UK in \~2015 and had a rotisserie-style restoration. More details are on [the original listing](https://www.motorcarclassics.com/1971-datsun-240z-c-866.htm), lots of interior and exterior shots.

I want to close in saying that this is an absolutely privileged thing to get to do, but the look on my parents' faces was priceless - and being in the Z with my Dad driving to his favourite go-to, through the local Tim Hortons (coffee) drive-through, was the icing on the cake.",74,1748050949.0,Datsun,3,1.0,False

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1748050529.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

1ktzwue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ktzwue/im_am_wrong_but_need_advice_perspective_on_some/,I’m am wrong but need advice/ perspective on some things my mom said to me.,"A year ago I had to move in with my mom because I had a psychotic episode with delusions related to my work place and criminal activity. I lost my job and my apartment and the life I built by myself  which was hard because I was estranged from my family and I have a mild physical disability. I recconted with my family b/c of my psychotic episode my father and I were estranged do to his addiction and my mother and I were estranged because she moved countries... same continent but we were never the family that could afford to fly. Plus we never got along when I was a kid so we just drifted apart. To my mothers credit after 10 years of not speaking she did drop everything and come and get me because I had been released from the hospital and had nowhere to go. This was a year ago.

My recovery from my phycosis has been slow... I was very removed for a long time & Until 3 months ago I still believed some of my dilusions and I struggle with frequent panic attacks about needing to get my life back on track.

I have a psychiatrist who has put me on anxiety and adhd medication... I have trouble staying focused majorly it's like there's a laps and I'm not always with it.

Today I accidentally set my garbage can on fire it burned down to the ground. I threw away an ash tray of butts and I guess one was still smoking.   .. beside the trash can my moms plant being burned and a marginally melted curtain (bottom) everything is fine and nothing bad happened.

Obviously I am wrong! Something bad truly could have happened!

Part of the reason I  felt the need to empty the ash tray is because my mom has OCD and I know a full ash tray bothers her and I wanted to empty it before I started my remote work shift.

My mom took the incident to vent about some additional things that have been bothering her. (we live  in a small 2 bedroom.)

1. I ate her crackers and didn't order her milk or anything when I ordered myself groceries. And she always picks me up a sandwich or something if she's getting something for herself... but we had spoke the night before and she said she didn't need anything. So, when I ordered groceries it just didn't register to check again physically if she needed something... I have boughten her groceries before when she was broke and lunch and stuff I'm not a complete dead beat... and like idk she's my mom a tally on this feels weird plus this is the first time she has ever helped me in  my adult life!

2. I could help around the house more. My bedroom and bathroom are disgusting to her but she has OCD and the rooms are in truly  average condition + I do things like towels and the dish washer.

3. I guess I have ruined all her beer glasses by putting coffee in them. But the dish washer just sucks and leaves them foggy 

4. She is depressed because of me which maybe partly true but also her mother just died and she is struggling with it and there are some changes at work happening that are making her nervous.

5. She had to change her life for me. Before a year ago she was never home always out with friends. But she's said she stopped visiting her friends as much b/c she was tired of the 30 min drive and no one ever comes to visit her.

6. I'm not helping myself enough or improving too slowly. She said in December that I need to get a job, or go to therapy or leave... I've gotten a job and been seeing a psychiatrist for 3 months tho I did drag my feel on finding a Thearpist and have just found one recently... I guess I was overwhelm by the concept I'm not great about talking about things and have been disappointed in the past by Thearpist plus I'm self pay so I just wanted to make sure its Worth it.

My mom thinks I'm lazy but until 3 months ago I still believe my delusions. And I struggle with anxiety and adhd.. I really do just kinda loose focus or not see things or hyper focus on the wrong things... like when cleaning up the fire ash I tracked some inside because I have a hard time breaking down a task and am uncoordinated... when I said this she said it's just because I don't do it enough but that simply isn't true... I could clean a bathroom a 100 times and the next time I see have no idea where to begin... I think it's an ADHD thing ah idk.. 

Additionally I have mild cerebral palasy a muscular coordination problem which my mother medically understands because she is physical Thearpist but she's always saying i use it as an excuse and things like I just need to think about my posture all the time and my back will get better but that's a lot of mental energy! I actually have a problem coordinating my muscles so it takes all my thought and it's exhausting me ntally 

I know the fire was terrible and all my fault but…how do I apporch my mom… she is so over me 
I don’t know what to do…

I don’t know about you guys but as much as I still try, there’s just THAT feeling now when connecting with customers that oh. This is really just a job.

1. MONEY!! So for 1-2 days i've been manifesting money right like getting random money and guess what 2 people sent me money randomly and I keep finding money in random places like😭 YALL DONT GET HOW HAPPY I AM, because I was so scared of wasting the money I already had on coffee but I got more so now I dont care about the initial one i had.



2. Getting my nails done: So i've been wanting my nails done and to go to a spa for a while (like you know acrylics)   but i wasn't able to do it , so 2 days ago I began manifesting a princess lifestyle and getting whatever I desired, basically being 'spoilt' and today my mom randomly took me to the spa and to get my nails done without me asking, so there's that. It's my first time getting acrylics cause I usually just get them painted and they feel so weird, like typing with them is a struggle but I love them, makes me feel like a diva tbh.

  
3. My crush coming back: So, this guy I liked disappeared for a while and no one knew where he was and stuff and all my friends told me we probably wont see him till next year and I manifested he will come back and today I got news that he was back.

  
4. more followers: So I've been manifesting getting more followers (still manifesting) and one random girl I've never interacted with followed me randomly, and 2 girl asked for my Instagram. Another girl that I've been dreaming of getting close to for a while followed me on my spam too like today has really been my day.

  
It's hard to type with my nails, so I'll finish here😭

Microsoft’s just rewritten the rulebook by turning Windows into an ""agentic"" AI platform. What does that mean? Picture your operating system with a digital butler, one that can transform any webpage into an interactive AI hub. And yes, all this before you've had your second cup of coffee.

They're working on AI-native devices which could potentially turn the five-step dance of accessing ChatGPT into just one slick move. Imagine skipping the digital foreplay and jumping straight to the action. 

**Google's Shopping Revolution**
Google doesn't want to be left behind in this digital revolution. They're integrating AI into Search to streamline shopping experiences—talk about cutting out the middle man. Whether you want to try on clothes virtually or let the new ""agentic checkout"" handle your purchases, Google’s making sure retail therapy is as effortless as a swipe right.

I checked out this new outdoor public art experience called *Path of Liberty: That Which Unites Us* — it’s a six-acre immersive exhibit set up at Freedom Plaza (1st Ave between 38th and 41st). It’s kind of like walking through a visual podcast meets museum meets outdoor installation. 15-foot portraits, short documentary films, and soundscapes featuring everyday Americans from all over the country telling their stories. Really moving, and surprisingly chill for Midtown.

It’s FREE and open all summer. I stumbled into it not knowing what to expect and left thinking about how diverse and messy and beautiful this country is and how we’re all more connected than we think.

Also, if you’re into photography, design, or public art in general, it’s definitely worth checking out. The scale alone is wild. Bring a friend, grab a coffee, take your time with it. They even encourage you to “add your voice” to the installation (more info on their site: [pathoflibertynyc.com](https://www.pathoflibertynyc.com)).

My name’s Ally. I’m a 17-year-old trans girl, and after months of hard work, I’m thrilled to finally share something really personal: my very first published work, a debut novel, *Perfect Little Angel?*. It goes live on itch.io this Sunday.


It’s a contemporary YA story with LGBTQ+ themes, exploring gender, trauma, and self-discovery through the eyes of Ally Clark—a seemingly perfect girl who's been slowly falling apart behind her smile. When a mysterious new girl named Jae enters her life, everything starts to change.

Blurb:
Allison ""Ally"" Clark was the golden child.
Soft-spoken, straight-A student, and damn near flawless—at least on the outside. For years, she’s tried to live up to the “perfect little angel” her mom always said she was. Even when it was exhausting. Even when it hurt. Even when the mirror felt like an enemy.
Beneath the practiced smile is a girl quietly unraveling, clinging to the hope that if she’s perfect enough, maybe—just maybe—she’ll finally feel like enough.
Then comes Jae.
All black leather and soft eyes, with a crooked smile that sees straight through her. What starts as a coffee shop meet-cute slowly brews into something deeper—a love that might just be strong enough to help Ally rebuild from the inside out.
But just as things begin to feel real, one shattering moment threatens to undo it all. Glass breaks. Hearts break. And Ally is left wondering:
Can a perfect little angel survive being human?

If you're into stories that blend emotional realism with queer romance and introspection, I’d love for you to check it out.

Release Date: Sunday
Platform: itch.io

If you’ve ever battled with identity, perfectionism, or just trying to survive being yourself… this story’s for you.

1ktzj8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/1ktzj8r/make_magic_weird_use_your_senses/,Make magic weird. Use your senses.,"I have a passion id love to share and it’s always something that I try to impart on new players and DMs. Flex the 5 senses of description and use the rule of cool. The PHB and DMG are just tools, and you should always at least try and make some things your own.

Magic itself is weird as hell. You’re making people huge, you’re talking to corpses and summoning elementals and traveling to new worlds. Magic does crazy things and it makes the game so much more fun to describe it or tweak it in weird ways.

An example I have is how I handle speak with plants. Plants in real life can see (kindof). They rely on shadow, electrical symbols from mycelium, and in the case of Boquila Trifoliolata, some actual witchcraft of just knowing what other plants look like. So I describe speak with plants as making shadows and reading the shadows the plants make in return. The plants can also replicate the footsteps taken near them (grasses) or how they were moved (dense jungle). Druids just learn through the spell what these “answers” are in context. It kindof just speeds up their natural movement to replicate phenomena that happen on their slower scale. You get a “ghost play” of what happened in that location.

I also love adding colors and scents to spells. Not only does it make them memorable, but if you’re running a murder mystery in your campaign and the players know that enchantments smell slightly of marshmallow or teleportations and lightning spells both leave a smell of ozone, but only lightning spells leave fractal scorches in wood. Teleportation leaves a blue dust. Now they can get context leads they otherwise wouldn’t, and they are playing the game and not just rolling dice.

I’d love to see other people’s examples, but I guess the main point is to utilize the 5 senses when describing spells. It makes the game so much more engaging. In my theatre group I was in we called it “painting the scene” and it’s great for storytelling.

When you enter a room what are 5 things you notice? The creak of the wood? Is the floor cold? Can you smell the trash can or the laundry going? Can you taste recently brewed coffee on the air? Do you see motes in the morning light?

“You look upon the yawning gate of the cave system that connects to the buried temple you know is beneath your very feet. The oppressive choking darkness creeps to the edges of the stone, daring to touch the light. The walls feel wet with moisture and thick with moss. The smell and taste of damp and mold fills your lungs as you breathe the sharp cold air. You hear dripping from the natural groundwater that permeates this tunnel and the distant scurrying of vermin. Suddenly, as your party steps in, a bright glyph sparks on the wall and you smell the sudden spike of sulfur and cinnamon. A fireball spell. Everyone roll a dexterity save.”

Take a minute to imagine that space and then describe what you are experiencing to your players. I feel like a lot of newer DMs get rushed into a description and a lot of players fail to “own the space” when describing their characters actions.",20,1748048580.0,DMAcademy,4,0.85,False
1ktzj8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1ktzj8n/the_persistent_doorbell_would_love_some/,The Persistent Doorbell -- Would Love Some Constructive Feedback on It!,"I moved into the house for a fresh start. It sat in the quiet part of town. The rustle of autumn leaves softened the sounds outside. Neighbors expected silence like an unspoken rule. The house was small—a one-bedroom with peeling paint, a sagging garage, and a fenced-in yard overgrown with weeds. It wasn’t much, but it was enough. I wasn’t looking for comfort, just a place where I could disappear, far from the wreckage of a life weighed down by pain.

I’m baffled that I could afford the house. It didn’t have a listing price—just some blurry, disjointed photos. The ad’s title made me chuckle: **“NICE HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY (SRY FOR BAD PHOTOS, NOT A GOOD SHOT).”** The description below was simple and to the point: *Cozy,* *a one-bedroom* *home available immediately. Call 555-234-6765 if interested. Serious inquiries only.* I picked up the phone and dialed. A man answered, introducing himself as “Marv Zwicker.” He spoke with the oily charm of a sleazy car salesman trying to unload a lemon. He asked if I could meet him at the house in thirty minutes. I enthusiastically agreed. What did I have to lose?

When I arrived, the house seemed to groan, resentful of my presence. The moment I stepped into the yard, the shutters flung open like eyelids waking from a long, restless sleep. The screen door swung violently in the wind, barely hanging by its hinges, as though trying to wave me off. A sign was staked near the property, boldly advertising the agent’s name, real estate company, phone number, and a grainy photo of his face. Marv Zwicker’s birdlike features and shiny bald head made him look like a gangster plucked straight out of a 1940s detective movie. Marv Zwicker—Premier Agent, Closing Deals Since the Advent of Real Estate!

But it wasn’t his face or the tagline that caught my attention. It was the smaller sign nailed crookedly to the corner of the main one, written in bold, red letters:



**NOT HAUNTED.**



I nearly laughed out loud. Who advertises that? It seemed more like a warning than reassurance, and I wondered if Marv realized how many buyers it would scare off. But what did I know? I wasn’t in the real estate business!

Before I could survey the property further, a beat-up old purple jalopy sputtered into the driveway. Marv Zwicker emerged from the rusting heap, a vision of chaos in a yellow plaid jacket, red pants, and a brown tie. His oversized, clunky shoes made him waddle like a penguin, and the whole ensemble looked like he’d dressed for a circus but bailed halfway through.

“There you are!” he gasped, waving furiously as he scampered toward me. His voice was high-pitched and nasally, like a balloon losing air. “Come, let’s get you inside!”

He fumbled in his jacket pocket for the key, his hands trembling slightly, then unlocked the door. It creaked open, and a stale, musty smell spilled out, thick with dust and something faintly metallic. Inside, the wood floors were mottled with strange purple stains, as if someone had spilled gelatin and never cleaned it up. The peeling wallpaper—a sickly green—gave the house the air of a child shut in bed with a fever.

A persistent dripping sound echoed faintly from somewhere deep inside, each plunk a ghostly metronome demanding attention. The living room was cramped, barely large enough for a couch and a television. The kitchen was smaller, with the fridge and stove shoved together in one tight corner near the back door.

Marv led me down a short, dimly lit hallway to the bedroom. “And here’s where you’ll be sleeping,” he announced with theatrical flair, as if unveiling a grand prize.

The walls were striped with a strange yellow pattern, the lines running vertically like prison bars. They seemed to ripple faintly in the dim light, vibrating with the slow, uneasy rhythm of breath.

“What do you think?” Marv gasped, bowing theatrically, as if he’d just delivered a stupendous performance.

“It’s… nice,” I said hesitantly. “Needs a little work.”

Marv’s face fell slightly, his eyes dimming as though bracing for rejection. “I assure you, it’ll be ready before you move in. I just need to make some… preparations first.”

In rhythm with the persistent dripping from somewhere in the house, his wheezing seemed to rouse the place from a restless slumber. The walls groaned faintly, as if straining to sit up, while the wind outside battered against the cloudy windows, howling to be let in.

Marv led me into the kitchen and gestured toward a gaping hole in the ceiling, its jagged edges as though punched out in rage. He shook his head, muttering something under his breath.

“I’ll have that fixed too,” he said, turning back to me with a practiced grin. “So? Are you interested in buying the place? I can get you a great deal—pennies on the dollar! And you can move in right away.”

I’ll admit, I was apprehensive. The house was a complete wreck, and Zwicker seemed eager to unload it, as though it held some long-buried secret. I told him I’d think about it and give him my decision in the morning. I needed time to decide if buying the place would be worth the investment. The last thing I wanted was to get trapped under a crushing loan, buried in debt for years.

There was something odd about that house—its ugly, peeling wallpaper, the gelatinous blotches on the floor—that felt eerily familiar. It was like I’d been there before, though I couldn’t recall when or why. The feeling lingered, like a relic of some long-suppressed memory clawing its way to the surface. The house seemed to call to me, beckoning me to stay, its silent plea wrapping itself around my thoughts. For a moment, I shivered at the notion that it might want something from me, something deeper, something... essential. I shook the thought off, telling myself it was absurd. Houses aren’t haunted. Ghosts are nothing more than shadows of the subconscious, lurking in the corners of the mind, tormenting you until you let them go. I had my ghosts. I wasn’t ready to wake them now.

I thought about my old life—a cycle of loneliness, stress, and endless debt. Buying a house seemed reckless, even absurd, considering I could barely afford the rent on my apartment. But maybe, just maybe, the change would do me good. Escaping the monotony of crunching numbers and fielding phone calls might be the reset I needed to reclaim some part of myself. I've always felt worthless—never good enough for a relationship, a job, or a family. All my life, I’ve been told I’d never amount to anything. I was a shy, awkward kid, preferring books to playing outside. At home, things weren’t much different. My parents would scold me for the smallest things—leaving a light on, not finishing my food, or drawing—and thought I was subdued and withdrawn. My mom used to say I wasn’t a “normal kid” and threatened to take me to a psychiatrist if I didn’t start socializing at school. My dad would make snide comments behind my back, calling me a “dolt” if I wasn’t doing well in school or a “weirdo” if I preferred the company of my stuffed animals over actual people.

At work, I got the cold stares, the sideways glances, the menial tasks no one else wanted to do. Shoving me into a dark, cramped room with a tiny window and a never-ending list of chores was their idea of keeping me “useful.” I had always dreamed big, wanted more for myself, but I could never muster the courage to ask for it. No—it was better not to question, just to keep my head down and do my job. At least I was contributing. That had to count for something, right? Maybe even enough for Dad to finally look at me and say, “Good job, son.” But deep down, I knew that was nothing more than wishful thinking.

By the time I got home, I’d made up my mind. The decision settled into my bones as I drifted off to sleep.

The next morning, I called Zwicker. “I’ll take it,” I said, still unsure if I was making the right choice but determined to move forward.

“That’s wonderful!” Zwicker exclaimed, his enthusiasm almost unnerving. “We’ll review the loan, and I’ll have my guys start fixing the place up. Meet me there this afternoon. I’ll have the paperwork ready.”

That afternoon, the house was swarmed by an army of workers in blue jumpsuits, carrying ladders and paint cans with remarkable precision. They worked quickly, slathering paint on the walls, hammering nails, and sealing every nook and cranny with caulk and grout. One group focused on the hole in the roof, a tricky puzzle that required a unique solution. Within the hour, the house was as good as new. The floors were mopped and swept, holes sealed, cobwebs removed, and furniture dusted. Everything was spotless—except for the wallpaper. Zwicker reminded me that nothing could be done about it; it seemed permanently attached to the wall, stubbornly refusing to budge.

Once the house was in order, Zwicker handed me the keys with a wide grin. “Here you go,” he said. “Enjoy your new home!”

“Just like that?” I asked, half-expecting some kind of catch. “We’re not going to discuss the terms of my lease?”

“Consider it fully paid for.” He tore up the papers in his hand, letting the pieces flutter to the floor like snow. We shook hands, barking orders at his crew to pack their gear. “Thanks, kid. You did me a huge favor! Bye now!”

The whole thing struck me as odd. Zwicker and his workers left as abruptly as they had arrived, cramming into their van and disappearing down the road without glancing back. I stood there, holding the keys, anxious yet eager to settle into my new home. Thankfully, the house was already sparsely furnished—perhaps leftovers from the previous owner.

But as I stepped inside, I noticed something unsettling: the purple splotches reappeared on the floor. Great, I thought. I didn’t pay a dime for this place, and it’s already costing me a fortune in repairs! Sighing, I made a mental note to deal with it later and decided to walk into town for a bite.

The diner was about a ten-minute walk from the house, stuck between a mechanic’s shop and a fruit stand. A few customers occupied the space, their evening routines unfolding quietly. A tall man in a business suit sat in a corner booth, speaking intently into his phone while sipping coffee. At the counter, an older woman argued with the waitress, demanding a refund for her cold meal. In another corner, a woman sat crying softly, her posture suggesting a recent heartbreak. Smooth jazz played overhead—a relic of a bygone era, soft and unobtrusive.

“Welcome to Buster’s!” A young, perky waitress greeted me at the door with a bright smile. Her green apron was neatly tied, and her cheerful demeanor felt almost out of place in the somber atmosphere. “How many?”

“Uh, just one,” I replied.

“Booth or table?”

“Table’s fine.”

She led me to a small table in the back corner by the window. Outside, the last traces of daylight were fading, the dark settling in. My stomach growled loudly, and though the diner smelled faintly of burnt toast and something sour—maybe expired tuna—I didn’t care. All I wanted was a warm meal to calm my nerves.

The waitress poured me a glass of water and promised to return shortly to take my order. While I waited, I couldn’t shake the eerie feeling creeping over me. The diner was too quiet, too still, like it had been waiting for me all along.

As I pored over the menu, the doorbell jingled, announcing the arrival of a couple. The man wore a tan suit, and the woman clung to his arm in a black blouse, pressed tightly against him as though she might vanish if she let go. Something about them caught my attention. When I glanced up, a chill ran through me. Their faces… they weren’t there. A thick, swirling haze obscured their features, like fogged glass smeared across where eyes, noses, and mouths should have been.

The waitress greeted them with her usual chipper smile, seemingly unfazed. She sat them down at the booth next to me, the couple moving in eerie unison. Their presence unsettled me, as if the air around them were heavier, colder. My stomach churned, a sickening feeling that made me grip the table’s edge for stability. They whispered to each other—faint, disjointed murmurs that sent shivers down my spine. It wasn’t just the sound, but the tone, the hideous undertone of something not quite human. It felt like a scene ripped straight from a nightmare, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that they were aware of me watching.

Then they looked at me.

My heart beat against my ribs as the man leaned forward, rising from his seat and walking toward me. His pace was slow, deliberate, and each step echoed in the quiet diner. The whispers grew louder with every step. I grabbed my glass of water, gulping down a mouthful, hoping that awful presence would turn away. But he was calling to me, and our eyes locked—or would have, if I could see his eyes. The swirling cloud around his face churned like a raging tempest. I fought the urge to scream, desperate not to disturb the other patrons.

Before he could reach my table, the waitress appeared beside me, notepad ready to take my order.

“Are you alright, sir?” the waitress asked, her voice soft and comforting. I was relieved to see her standing there.

I took another sip of water, trying to steady myself. ""I'm fine. Who's that couple over there?"" I pointed to where they'd been sitting.

Her brows furrowed in confusion. “What couple?”

I turned to look—and they were gone.

For a moment, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. I hadn’t slept well the night before; the stress of the move had kept me tossing and turning, preoccupied with irrational worries. What if Zwicker conned me? What if this is some kind of cruel joke? But even now, I couldn’t shake the eerie feeling that someone—or something—was still watching me.

I cleared my throat, forcing a weak smile. “I’m not feeling well,” I told the waitress. “I think I’ll just call it a night.”

Her face fell, disappointment flickering in her eyes. “You sure?” she asked. “We’ve got some great specials tonight—crab cakes with cocktail sauce, or chicken parm with spaghetti. They’re my favorites.”

Both sounded delicious, but the unsettling encounter with the faceless couple had stolen my appetite.

As I started to stand, her voice stopped me. Calm, warm, and insistent, she said, “You sure you want to go? I could use the company. We don’t get many folks around here this late, being right off the highway and all.”

“Highway?” I looked at her, puzzled. “Did you say ‘highway’?”

“Yeah,” she nodded, pointing toward the large window overlooking the parking lot. “Right out there is the main highway into town. We get truckers through here all the time. Ain’t much out here but dead grass and birds. Are you a trucker?”

I froze. My memory insisted I’d walked through a quiet town surrounded by quaint houses with white picket fences and friendly neighbors. Surely she was mistaken—or just making small talk. I distinctly remembered crossing a street lined with homes before arriving at the diner.

“I… are you sure?” I asked, needing confirmation, even as doubt started to creep in. Maybe I was just delirious from exhaustion.

The waitress gave me a kind, almost pitying smile. “Course I’m sure. Been working here for months—I know a highway when I see one.”

She walked me to the cash register and handed me a complimentary mint. “You sure you’re alright?”

I pulled my coat tighter around me. The night air was turning colder, and her words unsettled me further.

“I’m fine,” I said, though I didn’t believe it. “I think I’ll just head home and get some sleep.”

“Suit yourself, Mister. Come back real soon,” she called cheerfully as I walked out the door.

Much to my horror, before me was a massive parking lot, packed tight with delivery trucks, their hulking forms looming in the flickering glow of the streetlamps. The road ahead was empty, save for the occasional pair of headlights passing in the distance. I scanned the lot, hoping to find someone—anyone—who might explain what was happening. Maybe I’d fallen and hit my head. Perhaps this was all a dream. Yes, that had to be it. A bad dream. How else could I explain any of this?

The night air had cooled, settling thick around me. I folded my arms across my chest and started walking. The road stretched on, endless and indifferent. The moon hung high, full and unblinking, casting pale light over the cracked asphalt. As I turned a corner, the familiar sight came into view: my house. It sat there in the distance, lights glowing warmly inside, as if it were waiting for me, like it was alive! The other homes on the street were dark, tucked in for the night. What time was it? I checked my watch: 5:30, the time I’d left for the diner. That couldn’t be right. It felt like hours had passed.

I made it through the front door and collapsed into the nearest chair. I didn’t bother turning on the lights. Just a little TV, I thought. A little noise to cut through the silence, and then I’d sleep. I flicked on the television, but it greeted me with nothing but static. Every channel flipped and jerked, flashes of distorted images struggling to take shape, never quite finding the strength. I only wanted the news. I could’ve sworn Zwicker promised everything was working. I made a mental note to call him in the morning.

Frustrated, I turned the TV off, locked the door behind me, and headed to bed.

That’s when the doorbell began to ring.

I waited, straining to be sure I wasn’t imagining it. Then, it rang again. Short, deliberate buzzes echoed through the house. And with each ring, the house seemed to shift—the gelatinous blobs swelling, pulsating, growing by the second. The floorboards groaned beneath my feet, and ghostly voices filled the air, whispering my name from every shadow. The wallpaper peeled away at the corners, revealing a sickly yellow goo beneath.

I edged toward the door, reluctant, every instinct begging me not to answer, terrified of whatever waited on the other side.

But the ringing grew louder.

And louder.

“Alright!” I snapped, my voice cracking in the thick, stifling air. It was late, and now some stranger was harassing me. I pressed my face against the door, my trembling hand fumbling with the knob. My heart pounded against my ribs, desperate to escape. I took a breath, telling myself it was fine—maybe somebody broke down and needed a phone, or a neighbor with a welcome basket, or a kid pulling a prank. The chorus of voices clawed at my ears, rising with each stab of the doorbell.

Gripping the knob tight, I flung open the door. A rush of cold night air slapped my face.

No one was there.

I looked around the yard, hoping to catch a glimpse of someone, anyone. But the street was empty. No footsteps, no pranksters ducking behind bushes. Only the silence of the sleeping neighborhood and the restless wind.

Then I saw it.

There, at my feet, barely visible in the moonlight, lay a small object. But I recognized it at once. A brown, fluffy teddy bear, its bead eyes staring up at me, a faded plaid bowtie around its neck. It was a face I hadn’t seen since I was a child—a forgotten friend I’d abandoned somewhere in the cruel march toward adolescence.

My throat tightened. Tears prickled at the corners of my eyes as I bent down and lifted the bear into my arms. Its worn fur was warm against my skin.

“Mr. Huggles,” I whispered, a tremor in my voice. “God, I’ve missed you.”

I inspected the bear, hoping to find a card or note explaining who had sent it and why. But there was nothing—only the sad, empty eyes of a long-lost friend. Painful memories resurfaced. I remembered my father’s anger whenever I brought the bear with me. “Big boys don’t need teddy bears!” he’d growl, snatching it away as if the thing personally offended his sense of masculinity.

I stepped back inside, clutching the bear close. I couldn’t help but chuckle. Who would send me this? Was it a message? A cruel prank? As I wandered down the hall toward my room, my thoughts turned to my grandmother—kind, sweet, the only person who ever truly cared. I remembered sitting at the edge of her bed, playing with my toys, when she handed me Mr. Huggles. “If you’re ever sad or need a friend,” she’d said, “he’ll always be here.” And now, far from home and chasing ghosts, he was here again.

But my brief reprieve was short-lived.

As I reached the door, I noticed something strange. Mr. Huggles’s eyes—once dull beads—glowed a deep, unnatural red. I told myself it must be the light from a neighbor’s security system casting a reflection through the window. But the eyes didn’t flicker; they burned. And then, as I stepped into my bedroom, a deep, guttural growl rumbled through the room.

Strange, I thought. I don’t remember Mr. Huggles making noise.

And then I saw the teeth.

I gasped, stumbling back. The bear’s stitched mouth had split open, revealing jagged, yellowed teeth. I dropped him, and he landed facedown on the carpet. When I bent down to pick him up, his head twisted toward me. His eyes blazed, his mouth opened wide, and a shrill, human scream burst from his throat.

I hurled him across the room. But then, from the bear’s torn, snarling mouth came a voice I had prayed to forget.

“Look at you, loser. What are you doing with your life? Can’t hold a job. Can’t finish school. Living in filth. What kind of man are you?”

I froze. My throat tightened.

“Dad?” I whispered.

""Don’t ‘Dad’ me!"" the bear spat. “Your mother can’t even look at you anymore. She cries herself to sleep. ‘Why can’t my son be normal?’ she asks. Why are you like this? Why are you such a goddamn failure?”

A hot anger surged through me, cutting through the fear. This. This was why I left home, why I ran.

The bear sat upright. Its red eyes pulsed like coals. The growling intensified, filling the room. The bedroom walls sighed and shuddered. Before I could react, the door slammed shut behind me.

I bolted to it, pulling at the handle. It wouldn’t budge.

“Let me out!” I screamed.

""Loser!"" the bear taunted, its voice warping. “Admit it! You’re nothing. Can’t even land a girlfriend. How sad is that?”

“Shut up, Dad!” I shouted.

The bear threw back its head and laughed—a maniacal, shrieking cackle that made my blood run cold.

I fell to my knees. The sound was unbearable—a shrill, unrelenting howl that seemed to come from every corner of the house. A bright, pulsating light filled the room. Shadows danced wildly on the walls. The wallpaper peeled in long, curling strips, the yellow goo beneath it collecting in the corners, thick and foul-smelling. My bed rocked violently, as if possessed by some unseen force.

“Make it stop!” I cried. “What do you want from me?”

""Admit you're a loser!"" the bear shrieked. “A failure! A reject! A worthless nothing!”

“Leave me alone!” I pleaded. “I hate you! That’s why I don’t call you! All you ever did was berate me… tear me down!”

“LOSER!” the bear roared.

That word echoed through my skull, a cruel, inescapable chant. Its mocking laugh cut deep, sending me into a blinding rage. I lunged for the bear, grabbing it by the neck. Its fur felt coarse, wrong somehow. I tore at it, yanking out handfuls of stuffing. The bear writhed, snapping its jagged teeth at me, but I clamped down on its neck and twisted until there was a sickening snap—and then, nothing but limp, empty fabric.

I staggered to the window, threw open the shutters, and hurled the mutilated bear into the night. I slammed the window shut, bolted it, and leaned against the wall, panting.

The house grew still. The walls settled. The oppressive light faded, and the shadows retreated.

I crept through the house, checking each room. No one was there. No voices. No glowing eyes. When I felt sure that I was alone, I washed my face and collapsed into bed.

I didn’t sleep. Not really. Every time I closed my eyes, I heard his voice. My father’s voice, snarling in my ears.

“Loser.”



Morning wasn’t much better. I woke with a splitting headache and a gnawing suspicion that I was being watched, like something was lurking in the corners or waiting for me downstairs. I hesitated, not wanting to wake the house from whatever slumber it had fallen into. But I had no choice. I needed to call Zwicker. I had to know more about this house’s history.

I got up, showered, and dressed. When I made my way into the living room, everything appeared normal. The gelatinous blotches were now just faint stains on the floorboards. The wallpaper lay flat against the walls, as if it had never been torn. Still, the memory of the night before clung to me—my father’s voice echoing like a restless spirit in an old, cursed home.

I entered the kitchen and picked up the phone to dial Zwicker’s number. No dial tone. I checked the connection. Everything looked fine. I tried again. Still nothing. Frustrated, I slammed the receiver down. What else could go wrong? I made a mental note to try again later and to pick up some groceries. Maybe fresh air would help.

I sank onto the couch, my head pounding.

And then the doorbell rang.

And rang.

And rang.

“Not again,” I muttered.

The ringing made my headache worse. I pressed my hands against my temples, trying to drown out the relentless noise. But it continued. Louder this time. Longer. Each ring felt less like a summons and more like a threat. You’re opening this door, whether you like it or not.

“Okay! Coming!” I snapped. “Geez.”

I yanked open the door.

Nobody.

Just the quaint, quiet little town basking in the late morning sun. Birds chirped. A neighbor’s wind chimes tinkled in the breeze. For a moment, I almost laughed. Some kid must be playing a prank.

But then I looked down.

There it was—a toy telephone. One of those old plastic ones toddlers drag around, pounding on the receiver and sticking the cord in their mouths. Its bright, smiling face stared up at me, incongruously cheerful.

I couldn’t help but let out a small, incredulous laugh. Who the hell would leave this?

Still half-amused, half-unsettled, I scooped it up and stepped back into the house.

That's when things got strange. When I set the toy phone on the counter, its face changed. That happy smile turned into a frown. The face warped into one of rage—eyebrows knitted, teeth glaring, eyes raging with fire. Sweat formed on my brow. I heard the gushing of the gelatinous blotches as they were rising from the floorboards and the wallpaper as it was peeling from the walls. Suddenly, the television turned on by itself and was emitting static. The house seemed to come alive, groaning under the weight of my anxiety.

The toy phone rang.

“What?” I whispered. “How is this even possible?”

I looked at the angry face. With each ring, the face grew tighter, angrier. It was saying: *Answer the damn phone! Now!*

I picked up the receiver.

“Hello?”

“What ails you, huh?” a woman’s voice said. “Why must you give me an ulcer?”

“Mom?”

“Pathetic!” the woman sneered. “Why can’t you be more like your brother and sister? They have it together. They have lives. And you? What do you have? You make me sick!”

The anger swelled in my chest like a wildfire. I’d always thought if I ever saw her again, I’d curse her out, maybe even deny she ever gave birth to me. But it wasn’t fear that kept me rooted to the spot—it was pure, white-hot hatred. My mother despised me.

“Shut up, Mom!” I snapped. “Why are you doing this?”

“I raised you better than this,” she hissed. “You’re a lazy bum. A good-for-nothing. A wretched excuse for a human being.”

“Stop it, Mother!” I shouted.

“I should’ve believed your father. ‘There’s something wrong with that boy.’ But no, I thought you’d outgrow it. Thought you’d mature. Live a normal life. I was wrong. You’re a loser. A sad, pathetic, immature little boy.”

“Mom…” My voice cracked. “Please, stop! What did I do so wrong to deserve this?”

There was a pause. And then, colder than winter stone:

“You exist.”

Those words cut deeper than any knife. My hands trembled as I slammed the receiver down and hurled the phone against the wall. It clattered to the floor with a cheery ding and landed upright on its plastic feet. Its painted face was smiling again — its eyes fixed on me, mocking.

The stench in the house thickened, a rancid blend of rotting meat and sour glue. My stomach turned. I staggered to the bathroom, barely making it to the sink before vomiting. And when I looked up—

The phone was there. Perched on the counter. Grinning.

It rang.

Pick it up, loser, it seemed to whisper.

My hands shook as I lifted the receiver.

“Hello?”

“What ails you, huh?” the voice sneered again. “Why can’t you just admit you’re a loser? You’d do us all a favor if you left this world and didn’t come back.”

“Mom…”

“I wish you’d never been born.”

Something in me snapped.

I grabbed the phone and bolted outside. I threw it onto the ground and stomped on it with everything I had. The plastic buckled under my heel with each furious blow. From within its cracked shell came a shrill, child-like wail.

*“Stop! Stop! You’re hurting me! Agh!”*

I kept stomping. Again. And again. Until nothing was left but jagged bits of yellow, blue, and red plastic scattered across the porch.

Silence.



My mind was a cluttered mess. What was happening? I moved out here to get away from them—from my old life, from the memories—to find myself, to maybe carve out a purpose. But my parents kept coming back to haunt me, to torment me, as if they refused to loosen their grip. I could feel their message in every shadow: Come home, so we can finish what we started.

I had to call Zwicker. Not that I wanted to go home, but I couldn’t stay in this house any longer. Maybe I could find a cheap apartment in the city, get a job, and start over. I rushed back inside, slammed the door behind me, and grabbed the phone. I dialed, praying he’d answer.

Yes, I thought. I’ll tell him I’m moving into the city. I’ve found a job. I’m leaving this place. He’d understand. He had to.

A voice answered.

“Zwicker?”

“Ah,” he said, with a tinge of sophistication. “I’ve been expecting your call.”

His wheezing filled my ears like old, caked earwax. I shuddered, dreading what might come next. There was something off about his tone—too precise, too practiced. It sounded… sinister.

“You have?” I asked, already regretting it.

“Yes, well, I assume you like the place?” he chuckled. “You fit right in.”

I froze. The way he spoke—it was like he knew. Like he’d known all along. He chose me for this house. He knew it was haunted. He knew what was happening here. And he still picked me. 

“Why?” I asked. “Why me?”

He cackled, deep and raspy. “Only *you* can answer that, kid. You chose to live here. You can leave at any time. And yet…you keep coming back. Ask yourself why. *Why do I keep coming back? Why can’t I let go?*”

My throat tightened, eyes stinging with tears. “I… I don’t know. But I want out.”

“Do you?” His voice dropped to a whisper. “Or do you want to stay? To keep coming back, like you always do?”

“What are you saying?”

“Can’t help you, kid,” he rasped. “Gotta go.”

“Wait!—”

The line went dead.

Suddenly, it all came rushing back. The looks. The stares. The silent whispers. Neighbors coming to the house, asking my parents why I never went outside, why I never played in the park with the other kids. The cold, empty stares as I trudged to the bus stop for school. Cloudy, indistinct faces that haunted my dreams. People pointing and murmuring, simply because I existed. Because I liked to read. Because I kept to myself. Because I was shy around girls and couldn’t hold a gaze.

*“Something’s wrong with him,” they’d say. “Stay away from that kid—he’s got issues.”*

No friends. Me sitting alone on the playground while the others played tag and frisbee. And as I got older, the whispers grew louder, nastier.

*Worthless scum. Freak. Loser.*

It was enough to drive someone over the edge.

The house stirred. The walls seemed to close around me, pressing down with a suffocating weight. I had to do something. I fumbled with my belt, looping it around my neck. If I couldn’t leave this place—if this house was determined to torment me forever—maybe it was time to feed into the horror.

But just as I was about to pull tight, a sound cut through the chaos. A familiar sound, rising above the pounding voices and crushing memories. A sound I wished I could forget.

The doorbell rang.

And rang.

And rang.

“Who the hell is it now?” I snapped. “Can’t a man get a moment’s peace?”

The gelatinous blobs swelled up from the floor again, the putrid stench hitting me like a fist. The wallpaper peeled from the walls. The television flickered to static.

I was losing my mind.

This time, the doorbell was deliberate, furious—rapid jabs against the button, like a demand. The smell grew thicker, choking me. But something… someone was calling to me. Familiar voices, too familiar, urging: *Let us in. We have something for you.*

I tried the door. It wouldn’t budge.

I tugged, pulled, and pounded with my fists. Nothing. And behind the bell, now came pounding fists, louder, heavier, rattling the frame.

I screamed that I couldn’t open it, but the pounding only grew louder.

The blobs rose higher, writhing like things alive. I backed away, terrified of whatever waited on the other side.

Then the door burst open.

And I screamed.

Standing on the porch were the faceless couple from the restaurant. The man held a box, neatly wrapped in a bow. The woman extended a pale, thin hand, motioning me toward the gift.

I got to my feet, moving slowly, afraid to breathe. The man pressed the box into my hands. The woman pointed to it. No words. Just that gesture.

With trembling fingers, I untied the bow and tore away the paper.

Inside was a photo.

A family photo.

My parents, smiling widely, their arms around me. Except… my face was blotted out. And across the top, scrawled in thick black marker:



**LOSER.**



It felt like a blade to my heart. My stomach twisted. I let out a scream.

They hated me.

The couple stepped closer. Their faces began to shift, features forming and contorting until I saw them—my mother and father. Their eyes were hollow, empty; their smiles crooked and inhuman.

“Come with us, son,” they said in unison, their voices overlapping, merging into one cold, twisted plea. “We’ll take care of you. Come home. We miss you.”

“No… stay away,” I stammered, retreating toward the house. “I want nothing to do with you!”

“We’re sorry, son,” they cooed. “You don’t understand. We weren’t bad parents. We didn’t mean it. We didn’t know what we were doing.”

“Lies!” I howled. “All lies!”

“You were unplanned. Unwanted. We didn’t know how to love you…but we do now. Come home. It’s where you belong.”

“No!”

As I backed into the house, their faces solidified, the faces I knew too well. The faces of the people who tormented me, who made my life a waking nightmare. They inched closer, their hands outstretched, trying to cross the threshold.

I slammed the door and locked it tight.

But nothing changed.

The blobs still festered and grew. The wallpaper hung in shredded, curling strips. The static of the television filled the room like a low, angry drone. And the doorbell… the doorbell kept ringing… *ringing and ringing and ringing*—each chime sharper…more insistent…more desperate…

“Let us in!” they cried. “You can’t hide forever!”

And in the suffocating darkness, I saw them—the teddy bear with its blood-red eyes and gleaming teeth, watching me from the corner. The toy phone, its horrible grin beckoning. And behind me, the pounding fists and the hellish chorus of sounds swelling to an unbearable crescendo.

I looked up at that hideous wallpaper with its wretched, vertical pink lines. The pattern seemed to breathe, bulging ever so slightly, as if the walls had grown lungs. And in the dim light, I saw what looked like a shadow fluttering this way and that, thrashing against invisible bars. It fought to shake itself loose, desperate to escape, but the sickly goo clung to it like cobwebs, thick and unyielding. The thing—whatever it was—writhed and twisted until it became hopelessly stuck, plastered within that cell of yellow-green filth. A prisoner forever, sealed behind that suffocating, oozing hell.

And for a moment, I thought I saw myself from behind those bars…my body, staring at me… at the wall. Lifeless. 

I covered my head with my hands and screamed.

“LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!”

But nobody heard me.
