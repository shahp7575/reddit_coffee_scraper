1ks4va6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ks4va6/aita_queen_bees_wanna_be_real_housewives/,AITA; Queen Bees & Wanna Be Real Housewives,"(Updated Title; Ran Over By Bridezilla & Her 18 Wheeler Drama Mobile) 

I, F/30, recently joined a friend group (girls ages 26-28) which started out extremely enjoyable and we did a lot of fun things together like cooking events and PowerPoint parties. It started out easy and enjoyable and I’ve never been in a girls group like this before. We all became very close and I started to feel like part of the clique, until recently. It was dramatic and based in drama but I was not really part of it at the time. They watch drama shows together. 

I was asked by “lead”/original connector of the group to help plan her bachelorette party. Event planning is in my background, in tandem to support her best friend and the girl she asked to officiate. I’m not in the wedding party but I had gotten really close with this girl because we’d have coffee every morning after Pilates together.  I genuinely thought I was being a good friend, but now I realize I was being taken advantage of. 

A few weeks into planning, the officiant didn’t do something exactly the way the bride wanted it and the bride then took it completely to a new level, and cut her out of not only the bachelorette party but also the wedding. So in turn, the entire bachelorette fell to me, keep in mind that I’m not in the wedding besides guest status. I genuinely enjoy planning and really wanted to give my friend a good experience since she was having such a hard time. 
- The bride actually made her PowerPoint about the officiant and all the reasons why she was cut out.

- I booked the rental car (I’m scared of driving due to an accident. She asked me to drive since I’m the only sober one as well but said I wouldn’t be expected to drive when we were going out just around town to the grocery stores). I ended up driving the whole weekend to dispensaries, groceries, etc. The group also made fun of my cautious driving of which she didn’t stand up for me.
- I spent a lot of my own time and money on it which I’ll probably never see again. They made comments about how I was the only one with a “big girl job” and how I had “big girl money”, even though they never asked me what I did. My finances aren’t really that great, and this did put me into a little bit of debt. 

- The bachelorette is where things completely changed in my opinion. Over the weekend I discovered a common thread between most of the brides friends. She had had disagreements with all of them, which often resulted in the silent treatment for months and being cut off/out like the officiant. Including one guest who the bride had cried to me about over a year ago in how this guest had treated her.

- Over the course of the weekend this group of girls razzed each other playfully at first but continued to escalate into passive aggression and then straight up aggression to the point where I was taking the brunt of most of it. I got all the feedback; there was not enough food and then too much food. Etc. I left early one morning because I’m sober to find coffee before all the hungover girls woke up and didn’t text the group chat. I’m not used to group chats and didn’t know this was a rule. I didn’t want to wake them up. 

- I became the butt of jokes because I’m social to a fault. I’ll talk to everyone especially locals to figure out what’s going on. I ended up stumbling on a farmers market where I wanted to get more food for the group but this girl lost her mind because it was “her thing” and I shouldn’t have gone without her… like I had planned to?!? It wasn’t logical. 

- Regular comments started of “here she goes again” or “how many friends will she make” kept happening even though those friends often gave us good recs or free drinks. Before you say it, it wasn’t excessive, it was short and quick conversations. It got to the point where the girl mentioned earlier said “I’m about to give this b**** a Xanax so she shuts the f up” because she was hungover. I wasn’t even in the same room as her, she just wanted to be mean. I also was honestly just trying to lay low to return the rental car.

- When we got back from the trip, I told the bride at Pilates that I didn’t want to be friends with that girl anymore and she said she and the other member of the friend group would have my back because she had the same issues. I gave her books to give to this girl that I had bought her for her graduation which I told the bride I didn’t want to celebrate anymore. & she respected it. 

- A couple days later the bride made me contact the girl and try to make amends which resulted in her dodging confrontation and saying she didn’t remember but was open to talking later. I told the bride I was over it I just wanted to leave it alone and have a little distance. 

- The Friday before the girls graduation, I reached out because I wanted to check in. I did have time in the morning to decorate her place if the other girls were around (wfh on fridays) but they weren’t so I said oh well, I don’t have time the rest of the weekend. They ended up getting together and got upset that some big event didn’t happen for her like they had expected even though the bride knew how I felt. 

- The bride then explodes on me out of the blue saying that she didn’t agree with how I was handling things, that she didn’t like being put in the middle and that I need to reflect on my actions. She says I’m not taking accountability for how I made this girl feel. That I should reflect on my actions, and says that I’m making myself a victim. She says I’m causing a rift and that it’s my responsibility to fix things and that I’m not doing enough. She said she was going to remove me from the friend group if I didn’t apologize. She’s shocked that I didn’t want to be friends with this girl even though we talked about it. I record a voice memo trying to talk through it but she won’t listen to it because “it’ll ruin her day”, but at this point I was honestly kinda done. It was exhausting. 

- I immediately distance myself from the group to prepare for being cut off anyways. I saw this happen to the officiant so I figured it was just my turn. I left group chats and retreated. I felt like I was run over by an 18 wheeler of drama. 

We just received her wedding invite, I declined but my husband accepted. He’s still going to her husbands bachelor party, and I’m glad because they’re good friends. 

-AITA;
1) Declining her wedding invite instead of waiting to get uninvited? 
2) Reaching out to try and talk about things? 
(She said she has nothing to say to victims?
3) Removing myself from this group entirely? ",2,1747851235.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I'm REALLY good with AI, automations, and productivity. I'd like to create some free tools, systems, automations, etc to help fellow coffee shop owners increase their productivity (and lessen their annoying admin tasks). 

But my coffee shop is only online for right now... so I don't know all of the things you, as a brick and mortar shop, would need.

I'm not selling anything, and am not a spambot (you can see I'm active-ish on other subreddits). I just love AI and want to scratch this brain itch and help some coffee shop owners have less admin work, automate some online tasks, etc. 

If anyone has some time to chat, we can chat via email, WhatsApp, or even zoom (my schedule is limited but I can make time). I just need to know what types of tasks you'd like help automating or using AI for, and I can go from there.

An example of something I created recently was a custom chat bot to help the coffee shop owner create their emails, social media posts, etc in their own brand voice (so it doesn't sound like a robot) and batch everything out so they only have to write them once a month instead of every day or week.

And I just helped a new coffee shop owner create some recipes and a menu that will utilize the least amount of ingredients/supplies at first so they only had to buy the bare minimum.

Those are just a few examples of how AI can help. The sky really is the limit and I'd love to dig in and help you figure some things out. 

As far as cost goes, most things will be free but if you need to make customGPTs that would be $20/mo (paid directly to OpenAI, not me), and if you get SUPER deep into automations (like replying to emails) you would need n8n (you can check their pricing on their website).",1,1747851068.0,coffeeshopowners,0,1.0,False

1ks4sf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ks4sf6/how_to_get_consistent_shots_breville_bambino_plus/,How to get consistent shots [Breville Bambino Plus & DF54],"I have a Breville Bambino Plus and a MiiCoffee DF54. I’ve had it less than a month. 

I am currently using PT Flying Monkey coffee beans that were roasted on May 5th. 

My water is distilled water mixed with Third Wave Water Espresso Machine Profile mineral packets. 

My DF54 zero is at zero on the dial. I got it in the mail last Friday. I tried grinding my beans at 10 and it came out way too fast and sprayed espresso everywhere. So I went down to 9 and it was slightly better but still spraying. 

I worked my way down to 8 and I got 44g of espresso in 46 seconds. So I realized 8 is probably a good spot but I should pull my shots manually and stop it earlier than 46. When I let it go automatically, that shot was slightly bitter but it was drinkable. Yesterday at a grind size of ~7.8, I got 36g in 44 seconds with an automatic pull (because I didn’t hold down the button long enough. I was tired and hadn’t had my coffee) but the taste wasn’t as good. It was still slightly bitter. This morning at the same grind size, I got 16g in 1:04 (It was BITTER).  I had done all the same things. I weighed 18g of beans. I used a WDT tool and a leveler and I tamped it with a spring loaded tamper at 25lbs and used a puck screen. All of those and my bottomless portafilter came from Knodos on Amazon. It seemed that my grounds were too fine and choked my machine? 

The only difference I can figure out is that the previous times, the machine had more time to heat up, but I thought the Bambino was supposed to be heated in just a few seconds? I usually run a blank shot to heat up my machine and portafilter. But this morning I was running late and I didn’t.  Could that be the problem? Am I not tamping hard enough? I can change the spring to 30lbs. Do I need different beans? Do I need to adjust my grind size? I’m just a bit frustrated because I’ve done so much research and tried to make sure I had all the adequate accessories and coffee beans for this. It didn’t taste terrible, but it wasn’t good. My pulls never look like the beautiful pulls I see from other people who have the same setup. 

I just pull one double shot every morning for myself. No one else in my house drinks it. The time when I got 46g in 44 seconds, I had pulled several shots trying to dial in my beans because I had just gotten the DF54. The machine was definitely adequately heated up then. It’s the only piece of the puzzle that I can think of to be the problem. But how long should I turn my machine on before I use it? Either that or I don’t know how to dial in my beans. If I wanted to just pull a shot on automatic and get near the right ratio, do I just need a coarser grind size? Help meeee. ",1,1747851048.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1ks4s70,https://i.redd.it/xig6d0jhe62f1.jpeg,Went to London coffee festival,"I went to the London Coffee Festival last weekend, I’ve only been into specialty coffee for about 6 months, so it felt like the perfect chance to try a bunch of different coffees.

I ended up tasting a lot of coffee, and one thing that really stood out to me was how much of a difference roasting makes. I tried different roasting styles from the same roastery, and also similar styles from different ones and honestly, it made me realize how difficult roasting is. It seems like there are so many variables, and from what I tasted, most roasters don’t know how to handle roasting 

But two roasteries really impressed me: Tanat/Kawa. Their coffees were super clear, and well-balanced, just really well done overall. I also picked up a pack from Mobydick (photo for reference) it was a Kenya with both washed and natural process beans, 75g each. Not sure how famous they are but they definitely won me over.

Curious if anyone had similar experience?

1ks4ovy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ks4ovy/sudden_difficulties_exercising/,Sudden difficulties exercising,"I’m 17, trans FTM. I wear binders but I try to be as safe as I can (7-8 hours only when I’m in public, mostly just during school). I’ve had difficulties exercising before due to an eating disorder I had from the ages of 11-15 but I’ve been doing better and it has been easier. This was until yesterday when I could barely just be standing outside without feeling horrible. I was mowing the lawn (it was 76° and partly cloudy) and my heart rate kept going between 60 and 190 bpm. This was after about 14 minutes outside. I rested for a little while and had some water and Gatorade and started feeling better so I finished the lawn. It started happening again and so I took a shower and a nap. I felt a little better so I went to my marching band performance at 4pm, about 3 hours later. All we did was stand outside and play pep tunes but after about 15 minutes of playing (around 30 minutes total just being outside in 80° partly cloudy weather) I started feeling the same way and my heart rate was going up and down again. I ended up going inside and just sitting there the rest of the time because I couldn’t see anything clearly, my vision was foggy and blurry. After about 20 or so minutes I could see clearly again but I couldn’t stand up without feeling like I was going to pass out. One of my friends with a heart condition has a mobile EKG and she let me use it. I’m not familiar with what EKG results are supposed to look like but I’m about 90% confident they’re supposed to be somewhat consistent. Mine were not. Im going to try to figure out a way to link them in the comments. But it looked like it would be quick and strong then like really weak. She took it to see if it was just being weird but it was normal for her. I stayed inside the rest of the time and felt well enough to drive home. I ate dinner and went to sleep around 9pm and woke up at 1pm which is really late for me. Typically I wake up around 8-9am. I still feel really tired and I have a headache and feel dizzy standing up. Hence making this post. 

Important info:
As I’ve said, I had an eating disorder from 11-15 which consisted of severely under eating but I’ve been eating mostly consistently for about 1.5-2 years now. The only probably I really have around exercising typically is running. I have nerve damage in my right arm and back which makes it hard to hold stuff sometimes but has never caused anything like this. I have low iron levels and take an iron pill daily which my doctor recommended about three months ago. I take an allergy pill daily in the spring to help with pollen allergies. There’s no possibility of pregnancy. I exercise 3-4 times a week (every other day) inside mostly but sometimes outside. I fractured the radius bone in my right wrist (same side as nerve damage) and it never healed properly so I can’t bend it fully back without extreme pain. I’m 5’4 125 pounds. Yesterday I had honey but Cheerios without milk before mowing the lawn which is a typical breakfast. For lunch I had rice, chicken, and vegetables before my nap. I had some cheese it’s before going to marching band. I had pasta and chicken for dinner. I didn’t have breakfast this morning because I was asleep but I had chicken, rice, and vegetables for lunch. I have a red meat allergy and I’m lactose intolerant. I haven’t been diagnosed with any kind of heart problems and the only family history I have is both of my parents’ dads dying from heart attacks due to substance use. The only real stress I had was taking 8 exams in the span of two weeks but they ended last Wednesday (the 14th) and I’ve been out of school since then. I went to the pool Saturday and Monday. I got a little sunburn Monday but it wasn’t anything major, just a little red on my back. I typically drink about 70 ounces of water and I drink a Gatorade when I work out. I typically drink like 3 sodas a week. I only really drink them when I’m tired in the afternoon. I don’t drink coffee in the mornings. I drink tea with lunch, I rotate between a bunch of them and some of them are decaf and some of them are not, tbh I can’t say how often I have caffeinated tea in a week but it’s only one cup of tea a day and I sweeten all of it with honey and make it with oat milk.

• Smart teams

• Solid pay

• Growth blah blah buzzwords

Foto 2: Orgânico de torra média-escura de produtor e variedade únicos (esqueci de anotar qual). Doçura bem pronunciada, menos corpo e acidez, porém mais equilibrado, com finalização sem amargor e aroma de caramelo.

Foto 03: trouxe uma terceira opção que não estavam servindo no dia mas que as notas me atraem mais nos espressos (R$55).

I hadn’t been on a scooter since I was a kid, so I was kind of nervous. But it only took about 10 minutes to get used to the controls. At first, I was terrified of falling, but after a couple of rides, I started feeling way more comfortable. Now, I ride it every day. I use it to go to class, the gym, and even to grab coffee between lectures. The battery life lasts about 2-3 days, depending on how much I use it, and I’ve never run out in middle of the ride. It hits around 15-18 mph (depending on the mode), which is fast enough to get across campus in about 5 minutes. I don’t stress about being late anymore and I’m not in sweat before every class.  
  
My only issue so far is when it rains. I’ve had to avoid puddles a couple of times because the wheels get stuck in them. But that’s a minor thingy. To all my fellow students out there, if you’re tired of walking everywhere or paying for buses, seriously consider a scooter. It’s one of the best decisions I’ve made. What’s your go-to way of getting around campus walking, biking, or something else?",1,1747850528.0,ElectricScooters,3,1.0,False

She works at XYZ, two floors above me and I'm from a different company. I don’t really know her, but I’d like to get to know her and maybe take things forward if there’s a chance. We’ve had a few moments of eye contact here and there—nothing major, but just enough to make me wonder if there’s a chance.

The thing is, she’s always with her colleagues—even when she comes down for coffee or hangs out in the common area. So it’s not like I can just wait around for a moment when she’s alone—that would feel like straight-up stalking, and I’m obviously not going to stalk her.

One of my colleagues has a brother who works at XYZ, so I asked if he could help with an introduction. But it turns out she’s not in his team, so it may not be that easy.

Now I’m wondering—should I still wait and see if something works out through them, or should I just try to find a way to introduce myself directly? If so how do I go about that to keep it respectful and not make things awkward for her—or for me.

1ks4h6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1ks4h6c/switched_at_birth_or_so_she_thought/,Switched At Birth… Or So She Thought,"25 years ago, a maternity nurse secretly switched me out for her daughter. Unfortunately for her, my six-year-old brother saw this and secretly switched me back.
25 years later, the maternity nurse comes knocking with her actual daughter by her side. She accuses me, the heiress of Crawford Group, of being an impostor.
The company's janitor starts insulting me and insinuates that my lipstick is a cheap imitation. Even my boyfriend humiliates me with her. ""And here I thought you were the heiress of the Crawford family. You can't even compare to a hair on Pammy's head!""
When the DNA test results are out, everyone is stunned.
""That wretch bewitched me, Lori! Please forgive me—give me another chance!"" my boyfriend cries.
I look at him icily. ""Another chance to do what? To clean the toilets?""
Chapter 1
I had just stepped into the office restroom when I ran into Pamela Jones, the new janitor.
As soon as she saw me, her gaze dropped to the hand I was using to reapply my lipstick.
""I never would've guessed that someone of your status would use something so cheap,"" Pamela commented, her tone dripping with mockery. ""Ms. Crawford, that lipstick of yours costs 19.90 dollars for three and comes with a gift box.""
I was taken aback. That was impossible.
This was the lipstick my boyfriend, Trevor Freeman, had bought for me. He had told me that it was an exclusive brand and that three of them cost 200 dollars.
Pamela seemed to realize she had crossed a line when she noticed the change in my expression. She then quickly turned and walked away.
…
The moment I emerged from the restroom, I came face to face with Willow Shaw. Her face twisted with fury as she stood by the Mother and Baby Care Room door.
I had never seen her so angry before, so I quietly asked her what had happened.
In an instant, her words spilled out in a furious rant. ""I went in to change my baby's diaper, and guess what I found? A used contraceptive on the changing table!
""Who on earth would do something so disgusting? How could anyone do that in a Mother and Baby Care Room? This is infuriating! What if that person has some kind of disease?""
As the company's vice president, my anger boiled over as I listened to her account. I immediately called security and instructed them to review the surveillance footage to identify who was responsible.
Once I gave the order, I headed toward Trevor's office, intending to vent about the absurdity of the situation.
But when I entered, I froze. Pamela, wearing a slightly see-through deep-V blouse, was mopping the floor. The neckline plunged so low that her bosom was almost exposed.
Trevor glanced up at me, and his expression shifted to one of panic. Hastily wiping away the blood from his nose, he muttered, ""The air is so dry. I think I need to get a humidifier.""
Then, he added, ""I was so focused on work that I didn't hear you knock, Lorelai.""
I had never doubted Trevor's words before. After all, we had been together since university and were a couple for eight years.
""Have you forgotten? I don't knock when I come to your office,"" I replied.
Almost immediately, his nervousness was palpable. A knot of suspicion began to form in my stomach, but Pamela cut in before I could press further.
""Ms. Crawford, you really should buy your makeup from proper stores. Don't go for cheap deals on Amazon. You shouldn't skimp on what you put on your face, after all,"" she remarked, her tone full of scorn.
I froze momentarily at her comment. It took me a moment to realize that she was talking about my lipstick.
Trevor had given it to me for Valentine's Day. Hence, there was no way it was a cheap knockoff.
Since he was present, I figured that it was the perfect opportunity to clear things up. However, he interjected before I could say anything.
""Lorelai, the proposal you mentioned earlier was good, but I think it could use a few adjustments.""
His statement distracted me, and I glanced around the desk for a pen. Yet, there wasn't one in sight.
Pamela, on the other hand, eagerly volunteered to help. As she reached for the pen, she tripped and stumbled straight into Trevor's arms.
Her blouse strained with the impact, and a button popped open. Her bosom was instantly fully exposed.
Trevor fumbled awkwardly at that sight, trying to help her with the button. But the more nervous he got, the worse the situation seemed to spiral out of control.
Flustered, Pamela tried to fix it herself, too. Unfortunately, it only made things worse.
At that moment, her uneven breathing was the only sound that filled the air.
Chapter 2
I stared at Trevor and Pamela, who were still tangled together in such an intimate position. Something was off, so I cleared my throat loudly.
Suddenly, Trevor snapped back to reality and shoved Pamela aside.
""Lorelai, I was just helping her with the button. I didn't mean to—""
Before he could finish his sentence, I cut him off. ""That's enough. Go make me a cup of coffee.""
Years of knowing Trevor had taught me exactly what kind of man he was. It was clear that Pamela, the scheming woman, was behind all of this.
Hence, I figured that it was the perfect chance to talk to her alone and get to the bottom of it all.
But to my surprise, Pamela scrambled to her feet. With a pained expression, she rushed ahead of Trevor and said, ""Ms. Crawford, let me get the coffee for you.""
With that, she disappeared out of the office. Moments later, she returned with a cup in her hands.
I could tell that it was instant coffee from how quickly she returned. Since I only drank freshly brewed ones, I frowned and left the cup untouched.
Pamela's voice broke as she asked, ""Ms. Crawford, is it because you think the coffee's dirty? I swear, I washed my hands before making it!""
To my astonishment, Trevor sided with her. He was usually so compliant, but this time, he stated, ""Lorelai, give Pammy a break. She has never drunk coffee and doesn't know how to grind beans, so just let it go.""
Even so, I didn't respond. Pamela's eyes brimmed with tears at my silence.
""I'm sorry, Ms. Crawford,"" she apologized. ""I come from a poor family and never had enough food or clothes. My mom used to beat and scold me all the time.
""I've never had anything nice like freshly brewed coffee. I didn't mean to upset you.""
I was confused. I wasn't sure why she was suddenly so emotional. However, Trevor appeared to buy into her act and snapped, ""Lorelai Crawford, cut it out! I can't believe how unreasonable you're being.
""It's just a cup of coffee. Do you really need to make such a fuss? You're the Vice President, for goodness sake! There's no need to pick on your subordinate like that.""
Having said his piece, he grabbed the cup and downed its contents in one go, not even caring that it was hot.
I was stunned by his reaction, but what shocked me even more was Pamela's. In a flash, she rushed over and grabbed the cup from his hand, begging, ""Mr. Freeman, please, don't drink it!""
This time, even Trevor was caught off guard. Both of us stared at her, confusion written all over our faces.
Pamela's eyes darted around nervously at that sight. It was evident that she was feeling guilty.
Without saying another word, I checked the surveillance footage. And there it was. Pamela had used water from the toilet bowl to make my coffee!
I was livid and demanded, ""Why did you do this? You had better explain yourself!""
I reached for my phone as I spoke, ready to call the police. But before I could do anything, Trevor snatched it away.
""Lorelai, Pammy's still young. She doesn't know any better. Besides, you didn't drink the coffee. I drank it, and I'm fine. Let's just forget about it.""
Yet, his insistence only fueled my anger. ""What gives you the right to decide that I should just forget about it? She's not a child. She knows better!
""I didn't drink the coffee, but that was her intention! Unfortunately for her, you were the one who drank it. If she has the guts to use water from the toilet bowl today, what's stopping her from doing worse tomorrow? I'm calling the cops!""
When Trevor realized I was serious, he tried to throw my phone away.
Fortunately, I was fast enough to grab it back.
I had just steadied my phone when Pamela shoved Trevor aside and screamed, ""You're an imposter! Who do you think you are, taking my place and stealing my man?""
Before I could even register her words, my phone buzzed with a message from the security team. It was the surveillance footage from outside the Mother and Baby Care Room.
I played the video without hesitation. Lo and behold, the evidence was right there.
Trevor and Pamela had entered the room, one after the other. To my dismay, they stayed for almost an hour before emerging.
Then I saw Willow holding her child and walking in. Before long, she stormed out of the room. It was clear that Trevor and Pamela had left the used condom behind.
I couldn't believe my eyes. The man I trusted most, my boyfriend, had cheated on me with a janitor. No wonder he had been so protective of Pamela.
Trevor didn't give me a chance to unleash my fury before he dropped all pretense.
""I'm in love with Pamela, not you!"" he spat. ""She's gentle, kind, and caring. But you? You're just so high and mighty.""
Trevor continued, ""I bet you never saw this coming. The truth is, Pamela's the real heiress of Crawford Group. As for you, you're nothing but an imposter!""
Chapter 3
Right then, the door to Trevor's office creaked open. Then, I watched as my parents entered, followed by a group of shareholders.
My father was the first to speak. ""Trevor, you said that there was something urgent. What's going on?""
""Yeah. What could be so serious that it threatens the survival of Crawford Group?"" my mother added.
Trevor shot me a glance before answering, ""Mr. and Mrs. Crawford, if you hadn't shown up, the company would have fallen into the hands of an outsider.""
Startled, the shareholders turned to me, eager for an explanation. Yet, all I could offer was a wry smile and a helpless shake of my head. I was just as lost as they were.
At that moment, Pamela approached my parents before dropping to her knees with a heavy thud. ""Dad! Mom!"" she cried out.
My parents were momentarily stunned. They then instinctively took a step back.
My father pointed at Pamela, his voice sharp as he questioned, ""Who are you? I've never done anything to betray my wife! Lorelai and Shane are my only children!""
""Mom, Dad, the maternity nurse, Tabitha Baker, switched me with Lorelai. I'm your biological daughter!"" Pamela explained, her voice choking with sobs.
She continued, ""For as long as I can remember, Tabitha would hit and yell at me whenever she was upset. Worse, I often went hungry.
""I didn't understand why she was so cruel when I was young. She was my mom, after all. But then, one day, I saw the hospital's surveillance footage. That was when I discovered that I wasn't her biological daughter.""
The impact of her words was clear as tears welled up in everyone's eyes.
However, my father was someone who had seen it all. Hence, he wasn't easily swayed. He demanded, ""Do you have any proof?""
Pamela didn't hesitate. She pulled out her phone and projected the video onto the large screen.
The footage was over 20 years old, from when my mom had given birth to me. Since it was a private hospital, the place was equipped with surveillance cameras.
It was a short clip that showed a maternity nurse entering my mom's ward and emerging with a baby in her arms. Not long after, she returned with another child dressed in the same clothes.
But because the footage was so old, the quality was too poor to confirm whether the two babies were the same.
My mother watched the entire thing in silence. Then, she collapsed onto the couch and burst into tears. ""How could this happen? Tell me this isn't true! I was with my baby the whole time. How could the nurse have switched her?""
My dad, on the other hand, said nothing. Yet, his face had turned ashen.
It seemed like my parents were starting to waver, though they still looked unconvinced. Seizing the opportunity, Trevor pushed harder.
""Mr. and Mrs. Crawford, this mistake has already been made and needs to be fixed now. Otherwise, someone will exploit the situation. Pamela has suffered enough. We need to make things right for her.""
His gaze shifted to me as he added, ""And anyone who doesn't belong here should be shown the way out.""
Almost immediately, the room was filled with the sound of shareholders whispering among themselves.
""He's right. If Lorelai isn't the biological daughter of the Crawford family, she shouldn't be vice president,"" someone said out loud.
Another added, ""Exactly! She's an outsider, after all. Who knows when she might turn against us?""
""Before we figure out what to do with Lorelai, we should first acknowledge Pamela as the Crawfords' daughter and start training her properly.""
Even after hearing all the comments, I couldn't bring myself to care. A strange feeling gnawed at me as I continued to focus on the video.
For some reason, one of the figures in the footage seemed familiar.
Trevor noticed my distraction and sneered. He remarked, ""Oh, come on. No matter how many times you watch it, it won't change the fact that you're an imposter. The truth is right in front of you. I can't believe that you still have the nerve to be here!""
""Stop it, Trev,"" Pamela interjected quickly. ""Tabitha's the one at fault, not Lori. She hasn't done anything wrong.
""Give her some time to process all of this. Once she comes to terms with it, she'll leave on her own.""
I ignored them and rolled my eyes. A second later, I asked, ""Who's the young boy following Tabitha in the video?""

Whilst getting a coffee in Central London on the way to somewhere else, I noticed the coffee shop I was in sold v60s, moka pots and the like so I asked if they sold hand grinders. The staff were lovely and talked me through the one grinder they had, the rhinowares. They compared it to the Hario Skerton and assured me that it produced more evenly sized grinds more regularly than the Skerton, but that Comandante was the gold standard. It was £45 and in the back of my head I thought “that’s half the price of most decent ones, you’re not going to find much better” so I got it. I later discover this thing has ceramic burrs! I feel I’ve fallen for the ceramic burr slander somewhat, I’m feeling buyer’s regret but the shop only takes returns if there’s a defect.

巴西是世界上最大的咖啡生产国，你很可能已经喝过巴西咖啡了。咖啡推动了南半球最大城市——圣保罗的发展。在这里，每天几乎所有人都喝咖啡，跟意大利人一样。我们每次只喝一小杯。其实应该说意大利人跟我们一样喝咖啡，因为他们自己根本不生产咖啡，哈哈。

刚才我说到巴西的咖啡习惯：每天喝三四小杯，在家里、工作时，或者饭后在饭馆里喝。可以加点糖，不过大部分人更喜欢喝苦咖啡。但是，大概十年前，这个习惯开始发生一些变化。那时候，一些美国咖啡厅连锁，比如星巴克，开始在巴西开业。美国的咖啡习惯跟巴西的真的不一样：杯子大得多，咖啡没那么浓。你想想，他们的咖啡差不多就是把一小杯巴西咖啡放进一个三倍大水杯里稀释一下。美国人也很喜欢喝各种咖啡饮料。这些饮料特别甜，咖啡放得那么少，根本不像咖啡了，哈哈。

另一个很不一样的习惯是关于咖啡厅的。在传统的巴西咖啡文化中，其实没有“咖啡厅”这个概念。就像上面说的，我们在家里、饭馆、公司里喝咖啡，没有专门用来喝咖啡的地方。但在那些美式咖啡厅里，人们可以一边喝咖啡，一边和朋友聊天，也可以用电脑工作或学习。

对我来说，我很喜欢这两种喝咖啡的方式。早上喝一杯妈妈做的热咖啡，让我更有精神，也让心变得温暖。但有时候，我也想去一个安静的地方学习、工作，或者和朋友聊天。这时候，美式的咖啡厅就是最舒服的地方之一。",1,1747850116.0,ChineseLanguage,3,1.0,False

1ks4co8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1ks4co8/just_a_quick_question_can_you_usually_smell_when/,Just a quick question. Can you usually smell when a cup is going to be bitter?,"I have been using a moka pot for about a month now and occasionally I will misjudge my heat or the time for extraction. When this does happen, I look over my shoulder in sadness as I see coffee seeping out faster than I wanted it too. I walk over to turn off the heat and instinctively take a whiff. This usually results in an almost bitter or sour smell, that feels barely noticeable. Is this something that I’m just imagining or is this a real connection I’m making.

I do preheat my water to a near boil and I use a somewhat course coffee which will link below.

Any tips, tricks, and/or recommendations for coffee is highly appreciated. Thank you!

1ks4cd9,https://i.redd.it/97ppg75ra62f1.png,"Finally, a well executed marathon","# Summary

This is my 4th marathon, and I finally feel like I've executed the race correctly. I hit the wall on my first from going out too fast, and on my second because I ran a 4 race challenge weekend. The third I was recovering from injury, but was my first where I didn't walk at all. This one just feels like I learned what I needed to learn finally, and everything just clicked in to place. I'm hoping this helps someone else that was where I was before.

# Quick Stats

* Finish Time: \~3:02 (PR by \~12 minutes and BQ!)
* Age/Gender: M40+
* Height/Weight: \~5'11"", \~180 lbs on race day
* Training Background: Running since 2021
* Peak Weekly Mileage: \~41 miles
* Plan: Modified Pfitzinger 12/55
* Weather: \~52°F and light rain

# Training Methodology

I wish I had something better to say here. In the fall last year I used the Pfitz base building plan as written and built to 60 miles over the course of 10 weeks. I ran an 18:30 5k off of that. Excited by that result I set forth to do his 18/70 plan for this spring race. I made it two weeks. The winter weather was absolutely horrid, and we had snow down for an entire month. I lost a lot of motivation here. 18/70 turned in to 18/55 which turned in to 12/55 and even then I peaked at 41 mpw. Most weeks were between 30-40 mpw. I got in to a bad mental state from the weather and it was really hard to get out. I rallied decently through March and April and was able to salvage the plan somewhat.

I'm a very data oriented person, and I use the [https://vdoto2.com/calculator/](https://vdoto2.com/calculator/) religiously for planning. My training paces were based on my 18:30 5k result, and I felt like these were accurate as I was running them.

# Goal Setting

I knew I wasn't executing the plan well, but even so I needed to know where I was at. After a respectable 20 miler on the course at an 8:00 min/mile pace I had a confidence boost. I employed my normal strategy of running a shorter than goal race tune-up. I ran a half marathon in April in 1:27 with a closing pace of 6:17 min/mile over the last 5k. This surprised me, but gave me the confidence I had been lacking up until now.

Using the above calculator this predicts a 3:01:35 marathon time. Knowing that my course is hilly I mentally shifted this to 3:05. I also asked ChatGPT to use some of my data, including the half marathon splits, to set me A, B and C goals. These ended up as 3:00-3:03, 3:05-3:08, and 3:10-3:15. It was adamant that 3:10-3:15 was a 100% lock unless something catastrophic happened. Based on these factors I decided to shoot for 3:05.

# Race Strategy

So how do you plan to run a 3:05 on a hilly course? The answer is certainly not to run 6:56 every mile for 26.2 miles. I run with a Garmin watch and one of the features of that watch is called Pace Pro. It essentially lets you build a pace plan for a specific race based on goal time or pace. It has an option to use elevation based splits instead of mile/k splits. I turned this as high as it would go. This essentially cuts the race mostly in to uphill, downhill, and flat sections. Then, to make sure I made it through the big climb unscathed, I used a 3:10 goal time for the first 9 miles of splits, and a 3:03 goal time for the remainder of the race. This should have averaged out to about 3:05 when all was said and done. This allowed me ""permission"" to run a 7:30 mile going up hill, and green-lit some faster 6:30 downhill sections. The strategy here was to bank effort early, not time.

# Gear and Fuel Plan

Simple fuel plan for me. I used 7 Maurten gels as per their recommendation. I took 1 about 15 minutes before the start, and the rest I took every 6k throughout the race. There are aid stations every mile so I took a Gatorade cup at each one. Race morning was coffee and a pack of Pop Tarts, and a Maurten 160 drink.

I wore half-tights with gels in pockets, and a singlet with arm sleeves. The shoes were Adidas Adios Pro 3.

# Race Execution

# Miles 1-9:

I started the race with the 3:10 pace group. This was to help keep me honest and not go to fast. Mile 1 was pretty congested so a but slower than target, but we made up for it. My HR hit 157 at one point on the climb which made me nervous, but it recovered back to where I wanted it to be at afterwards so I didn't worry about it too much. I was 1 second ahead of schedule here, so the first part of the race went perfectly.

# Miles 10-20:

This is where I shifted to the faster paces in my plan. This section is a bunch of rollers and flats that are pretty nice to run through. Everything here was clicking, and the pace was like clockwork. The plan here was that if I hit mile 20 and still had my HR under 152 then I was green-lit to increase my pace.

# Miles 21-24:

I decided to hold off on an increase until 22. Even then I could tell that I was reaching the end of my fitness. See lack of training. Either way I tried to increase by a little.

# Miles 25-End:

Well, I'm increasing anyways. It's only 2 miles! Was able to run a 6:45, 6:35 and then close the rest at 6:15. It's amazing what the finish line and crowd support can fuel!

# Reflections

What went well:

* Ran a \~4 min negative split from the first half to the second
* Probably my best executed race
* Conservative pacing early allowed me to finish strong
* No GI or cramping issues — fueling plan worked

What to improve:

* I just needed more volume in training to help close the last 10k better

I hope something in this report helps someone out there run a better marathon.

I’m in a bit of a tricky spot and would really appreciate insight from anyone who’s gone through a similar situation or knows immigration policies well.

I’m currently an F-1 visa holder and was on post-completion OPT. My OPT started on February 9, 2025, and my 90-day unemployment period would have ended on May 10, 2025. I managed to secure a volunteer position starting April 2nd to stay compliant.

While still on OPT, I filed for adjustment of status (green card) through marriage to a U.S. citizen. My I-485 and I-765 (based on pending I-485, category C09) were both filed. My C09 EAD was approved on April 23rd, and I received the new EAD card on May 4th.

Now, here’s the confusion:

    •My DSO told me I’m still in F-1 status until I get a green card or leave and return on advance parole. She suggested I continue meeting F-1 requirements even though I now have the C09 EAD.
    
    •I want to stop the volunteer role and look for paid employment using my C09 EAD.
    
    •I briefly got hired at a coffee shop using my C09 EAD but quit for personal reasons after one day.

Questions:

    1.Am I still required to follow OPT/F-1 rules (like the 90-day unemployment limit), or does my C09 EAD supersede that now?
    
    2.If I stop the volunteer position, is that a violation of my F-1 status even though I have work authorization under C09?
    
    3.Should I report this job or end of volunteering anywhere (SEVP, school DSO, etc.) now that I’m working under C09?
    
    4.Is there any official USCIS guidance or federal resource that confirms when the OPT rules no longer apply after receiving a C09 EAD?

I’m doing everything I can to stay compliant but I’m getting conflicting information. If you’ve been through this or know anything, I’d really appreciate your guidance.",0,1747849903.0,immigration,3,0.5,False

I posted before about my fiancé trying to get a harassment order, but due to “first amendment rights” he could not obtain one. Thank you legal system for allowing straight harassment with no consequences !

ANYWAY. This crazy BM sent pictures that she was going to file a restraining order and claim fiancé “threatened” her family .. (never and let me repeat NEVER happened) All while continuing to spread misinformation all over social media about my fiancé and I. Made hilariously embarrassing TikTok videos as well. Even one leaving the court house when she filed for it, with the caption #court #win. Can’t you tell how “scared” she was?? She is also in her mid to late 30s so keep that in mind …

So we had court yesterday at 9am, two hours away mind you. She lives about 10 mins from the courthouse. She gets called and isn’t there. Judge gave her until 10am and said plaintiff isn’t present therefore it’s dismissed. As we’re leaving the court house, who’s outside sipping on a coffee and smoking a cigarette in NO rush at all? BM. I couldn’t even believe it. Like mam do you not understand how this works??? I can’t even begin to understand why she was casually standing out there because my brain is not the size of a pea. 

Nonetheless it was so satisfying 🤣 she attempts to be extremely manipulative and can’t even do it right. Just waiting for the post on social media about it. Next step will be me attempting to get  a harassment order if there is one more post with my name mentioned. At that point it’ll be 5 total regarding me and about 9 about my fiancé. Hoping judge will see it differently as I quite literally have done nothing to this girl and have a text stating to leave me out of it. My previous post explains the entirety of the situation and what she has done. 

But for now, I’ll just count this as a win 😎",4,1747849862.0,Stepmom,1,0.83,False

""Coffee, Miriam,"" I shout, and she answers from the hallway, her voice rich with warmth and laughter.
She joins me, hair pinned back, cardigan sleeves pulled to her elbows. We sit by the window, steam rising  between us. Outside, the neighbor's cat slips along the fence. The roses glow with dew. The two doves perch on the fence, side by side.
She brushes her thumb across the rim of her mug. 
""You'll water the roses?""
""I always do,"" I say. 
Before she leaves for her walk, she wraps her scarf, writes me a list of things to “ get done today” and places it in the empty cigar box my late father left me that lives on our fireplace. I kiss her cheek, always her left, and watch her disappear down the path. I grab the list from the box and hover my hand over the splintered edges reminiscing on my younger years. 
I water the roses. The doves coo at me. 

The next morning, the chipped mug waits again. I fill it slowly, steam rising like a choreographed dance. Miriam hums softly in the kitchen, moving with practiced ease. We share coffee, her eyes catching mine over the rim of her cup.
She pulls on her coat, bag slung over her shoulder. I open the door, the cold air quickly welcomed my cheeks snapping them like a rubber band. 
 ""Walk safe, Miriam,"" I say.
She smiles and nods, footsteps fading down the path.
The doves call softly outside. I water the roses, one petal curling slightly inward. The chair leans a fraction more to the left.
Later, I open the box and turn over the list for the day. I forgot a couple tasks on the list but Miriam doesn’t realise. 

Day folds into day, each one stitched with familiar threads. The chipped mug holds the same warm coffee, the garden breathes, she moves through the rooms like shadow and light, her presence steadying the days rhythm. She's is already moving about the house, soft footsteps in the hallway, the rustle of fabric as she folds the laundry.
""Coffee's ready Arthur” she calls from the living room.
Neighbors nod hello over the warping fence, a question in their depths left unspoken. At the corner shop, the cashier offers a gentle smile, fingers hesitating over the bag.
""I saw Miriam yesterday”
 she says quietly.
I nod, the words sticking somewhere just beyond reach.
At home, I open the box again, though I don't remember why and close it quick and sharp. Something smells like lavender. I go to bed. 

One morning, the chipped mug waits empty on the table. The kettle hums a tune I don’t know. Outside, the garden is quiet. The roses droop, petals pale. She pulls on her coat, slower now. I open the door but don't speak. Her smile is faint, and her eyes glass over staring through me.
The doves do not call.  The chair leans awkwardly, the cushion flattened.

 I water the roses, but the water spills, soaking the already drenched soil. 
The box sits closed, heavier on the fireplace. I rest my palm on its lid and forget what I am meant to do.

Another morning. The chipped mug is forgotten, cold. The kettle sits silent. She stands in the doorway, coat half on, waiting. I do not open the door.
She leaves without a word. The garden looks blurry past the glass. The chair is empty.
At the shop, the cashier's eyes cloud with concern. Mrs. Clarke's nod is slow, cautious.
At home, the box is open, but I don't know why.
Something inside it has been moved. I
trace the edges, wiping dust off the top of the box.
The garden is gone.
The chair stands empty.
The doves are silent.

I stand in the doorway watching the path where she walks, and I do not say goodbye.
I wait by the door with the mug in my hand, still warm, still hers,
but I cannot remember who I made it for.

This is the first time I’m sharing my story like this but I hope it inspires someone who's just getting started. Manifestation isn’t something I learned overnight but once I started living through it instead of just learning about it everything changed. Let me take you back a few years. I was stuck. I was in a toxic cycle of situationships working a job I hated and wearing glasses I absolutely despised. Every time I looked in the mirror it felt like I was looking at someone else's life. I had always been a curious person and when I first stumbled upon the concept of manifestation it sounded too good to be true. But something about it stuck with me so I went deep. I didn’t just read about manifestation. I studied it. Every day after work I spent at least an hour journaling visualizing or revisiting my beliefs. I kept asking myself what if it really is this easy. What if I’ve been making life harder than it needs to be. The first thing I changed was my relationship with myself. I stopped trying to control outcomes and started becoming the version of me who already had what I wanted. That shift was everything.

The most important part for me was healing and rewiring my beliefs. No affirmations in the world could fix the fact that deep down I didn’t believe I deserved better. I started doing inner child work scripting and shadow journaling. I paid attention to the random thoughts I had throughout the day. If I caught myself thinking men are trash I’d ask myself whose belief is that. If I said I’m not qualified I’d rewrite it as I’m becoming the woman who attracts exactly what she desires. Day by day I started to trust myself more. Then things started showing up.

Let’s talk about love first. I wrote a letter to my future partner. Every single detail. His energy the way he laughs how he smells how he holds space for me even the small things like how he texts when I’m overthinking. Three months later I met him. I knew it was him the moment we started talking. It felt like my letter had come to life. And the wildest part is he had also been journaling to call in the kind of woman he wanted and described me almost word for word.

Now this next one might sound unbelievable but it happened. I fixed my vision. Yes my actual eyesight. I had read that our bodies respond to belief so I gave it a shot. Every day I visualized myself seeing clearly. I walked around my apartment without my glasses and repeated I see clearly. I trust what I see. My vision is strong. I refused to speak negatively about my eyes. I added some basic natural eye exercises breathwork and tons of intention. Four months in I went back to the optometrist and she literally said this is rare but your vision has improved.

And then there’s the job. I stopped applying for positions I didn’t want. Instead I started being the woman who already had her dream job. Every morning I would sit with my coffee open my laptop and pretend I was already working for that company. I wrote fake emails created projects everything as if I already worked there. I stopped telling people I was job hunting and started saying I’m aligning with the right opportunity. Two weeks later I got a message on LinkedIn from that exact company. I hadn’t applied. They said they found an old portfolio of mine online and wanted to talk. I got hired within a week. Remote flexible amazing pay and the most supportive team I’ve ever had.

Here’s what I’ve learned. I didn’t get lucky. I got aligned. None of this happened just because I said affirmations or made a vision board. It happened because I changed how I saw myself. I shifted my identity. I became someone new. I worked on my beliefs every day. I acted like the version of me who already had everything I wanted. People always ask how did you do it all. And the truth is it’s not about doing. It’s about being. Let me know what you're manifesting. I’d love to share more about the steps I took or things I wish I knew earlier.",7,1747849725.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

“THE DANCEFLOOR” (STORY #1)

Celestia found herself blinded by the neon lights. 

She didn’t think this was where she was supposed to be. Wasn’t there only heaven and hell? Isn’t it why she had been told her whole life to avoid the seven deadly sins? 

She only remembered the wind going in her throat and her wishing the sky would catch her because she regretted doing it… unfortunately too late. 



She was sixteen,

And alive?



 She sighed and just walked the floors which seemed to illuminate depending on the force she put to walk on it. She was in awe of the place. 

Her wearing a school uniform with a loose tie and a skirt that hung a little low didn’t seem to bother the people there.



 “Maybe I am dreaming. Mabe I am not dead. Just in a very weird dream that I’ll eventually wake from.”

In the middle of her existential crisis and her swirling thoughts, she bumped into the group of old people dancing like there’s no tomorrow. Or was there? 



It seemed very unusual that they were the only ones dancing there. The younger people seemed to be depressed about the situation. 

One boy staring at the dancefloor, lost in thought, probably not about the world anymore. Not there. Not then. 

Another girl making infinity sign on her coffee mug with her finger, looking like she hadn’t slept in days. But all the people looked like that here. 

A family of three, the parents and the child, on the dinner table chewing their food mechanically, like cattle. 



“Huh, this is what I looked like. Always sulking with a humped back.” She muttered to herself. All these depressed people here reminded her of how she was on earth. “Dead people can get depressed too? Interesting.” she smirked.



She suddenly snapped back to reality. Perhaps not. The old people told her to join. They were wearing sequins dress and tuxes as if there was a wedding. Possibly a funeral though. She noticed a contrast in the outfits of the old people and the others. 

She asked an old woman with glitter on her saggy wrinkled face, “Why are you so happy about dying?” 



The old woman just smiled and said, “I have lived long enough to not care that I am dead. I was in fact waiting for it. I have done all the things I wanted to do. The others didn’t have that chance. Fate chose this for them.”



“Bu..But..I...” 

“Dance with us.”



She joined them. She didn’t care about the homework She didn’t care about the mid-terms. She felt free for the first time in a long while, when she started to let the music their flow through her.



She hadn’t chosen to be here, but she had chosen to leave Earth. Maybe it really was a dream. But she couldn’t care less.  And now it was time to stop thinking and dance... on the dancefloor.

THE PECULIAR TEST (Story #2)



I am sitting in my class, giving the test, which I barely studied for. I scratch my head and I know I am going to mess this up big time.

 

""*Why did you have to binge watch that show instead of studying?""* I ask myself irritatibly 

 

""Oww! "" my friend gives a yelp for whatever reason.

 

""Shhh!"" says the teacher. 

 

""Someone hit me! "" My friend protests. 

 

""Yes, it's realization. The realization that you should have studied and now another thing will hit you again, the realization that your little excuse is not gonna work. "" said my teacher savagely. 

 

I watch the whole commotion because I don't have anything better to do. 

 

""*Yikes! What is this test? I know nothing. I will fail. Yes, I will definitely fail.""* 

 

After the test, I go home and sulk. Because I have again nothing else to do. I close my eyes to curse myself but when I open them, I see a shadowy figure. Instead of black, it is grey in color. I look at the clock, 6:45 pm.

 

'Woah... Who... Whooo are YOU?"" I raise my voice at it. 

But I don't hear any answer, no. Instead, like a fever dream, I get teleported right to my class. 

 

""*Oh no, Not here again.*"" I show my frustration through my crinkled forehead. 

 

I notice that no one can here me here, nor see me for all that matters. Maybe they can feel me.... 

I go and take a peek in my friend's paper. 

*""She is as clueless as I am.*"" I mutter under my breath.

 

I stand too close to her. I can see myself, sitting across the classroom from my friend, looking too tense. 

""*Oh dear.*.."" I think and scratch my head but accidentally hit my hand on my friend's shoulder. 

 

""Oww!"" she screams, as I get a sense of deja vu.

Same events unfolding in front of my eyes as in the morning.

 

I find myself back to my bedroom, 7:00 pm.

""*I blew it off, I could've done something to pass the test*"" I realize.

 

No shadowy figure can be seen in my bedroom, only me and the regret...

But wait, that's not the end. Not at all. I wake up from this fever dream, to the TV in front of me, and the show that I had completed? No.. it was all a dream. 

Time, 6am, I have to get ready for school. 

 

""*Wait, I did not study though.""*

 I feel like complete trash. Good. That is what I deserve. 

 

I sit on my chair yet again, in the same situation, all feels like I am experiencing the same thing the third time, as if I am stuck in a loop. 

""*Wait, I heard we can't see the time in our dreams. Why did I...just.. I...""* 

 

""Amelia, Amelia"" I hear this voice as I see my teacher right in front of me. Apparently, I felt asleep in history class.

 

""*Ohhhh...""* I say to myself, grinning.

 

\*""\*Tomorrow is the test. You can't be dozing off like that!"" said my teacher angrily.

 

But I smile, knowing that I still have time, to study, so that I pass the test.

My teacher just sighs and continues teaching.

 

My whole world is shook up, *""What in the world dream was that!""* I raise my eyebrow and smirk, feeling.. what's the word? *Peculiar.*

1ks44nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1ks44nt/tifu_a_month_ago_i_fucked_up_two_days_ago_i/,"TIFU, A month ago I fucked up, Two days ago, I fucked up even worse. Last night, I think I nuked it.","I don’t know if this is the proper sub, so sorry if it is not. Also sorry on my poor grammar, and the rambling So where to even begin this. I guess let’s talk about how about a month ago I just left a relationship of 7.5 years. It was toxic for the both of us for probably the last 6 or 7 years. I still feel pretty bad about leaving her, but after contacting her yesterday for a few short texts. She said she’s doing a lot better and feeling happy, so I’m glad to hear that for her. Breaking up was hard on both of us of course. I don’t know how she has coped with it exactly, but personally I know I have crashed out a bit. I felt terrible, I was her first boyfriend and her first love. We met at work when she was freshly 18 I was 19 almost 20. (This I believe is definitely relevant in the upcoming parts) we didn’t exactly “move in” quickly together, buttt we did start sleeping next to eachother almost every night on around the third or fourth week. And I think around the second or third month she moved in with me. This is when the relationship I think started becoming toxic for the both of us, and maybe if we had better communication at the beginning and I would have been a better first boyfriend maybe we could have repaired things. But we tried it out for another 7 years and I think around a year and a half in when I moved into her place is when things got really bad for the both of us. We tried to talk it out a few days before I officially called it quits, we both had a list of boundaries for eachother that we couldn’t cross. Three days after the conversation, we had gotten into a heated exchange in my car I can’t even remember what about. But I know I was scared, my head was pounding, and her spit was landing on my face. I couldn’t do it anymore. We were doing some errand shopping before work, as she didn’t like to drive without me and since I didn’t have work for 2.5 hours we could do a quick errand run a town that’s a 30min drive away. We have done this a few times before hand, but recently I had just been doing them in the mornings by myself to avoid conflict in the car and public places since no one likes fighting, and especially not in public places. I’m not an extrovert at all. So because of the fight, I was a tad bit late to work. Not that bad honestly, like 15 mins and my first time being that late in my first two months. Now that’s a bad sign already for a company I believe? But I was told it was all good. After my shift I went home, and we acted like things would be normal again. The next morning, I was very cold and on my phone  playing YouTube videos with a bit of sound which I don’t usually do. We had a small house, and I didn’t want my videos over riding her videos coming off the tv. We did this for I think 2 hours before she said she was hungry, I agreed and since I always did the cooking or ordering out. I knew I had to find something for us to eat on, I was going to make homemade subs like I’ve done in the past but with the ways things went the day before I opted for subway. That was fine with her, she didn’t always like my cooking and that’s fair. I’ve worked in some small kitchens before, not everyone is going to like everything not matter how you try and prepare it. When I got home, we got into a fight almost immediately. I can’t remember what about, but it didn’t matter. I grabbed some essentials and left. I ended up sleeping in my car that night. All my family that I had good ties with, my mom, brother, and a few others were all on vacation. And since I had pushed away most my friends my senior year of high school so I didn’t fuck them up too, and we stopped hanging out with her friends and she had gotten into a few fights with her girls as well. Even though we were from all the same high school, and I know their boyfriends and we were friends back then. I didn’t feel right to reach out to any of them. I just kept driving, and refilling my tank. After around 800 miles on the first day, and another 500 miles the next day, and with funds in around $50 dollars and it costing me $35 to fill my tank I knew I had to stop. I had a troubled past with harder drugs when I was 17/18 and to a point alcohol. So I didn’t want to end up asking any of them old uhh acquaintances? For anything either. Instead. I texted my HR at my current work, let’s call her A. Basically asking if she had anyone friends in my town that would be okay with me sleeping on their couch. As soon as I sent it, I was terrified and believed I had messed up entirely. Messaging a co-worker out of the blue, at 8:30 at night is not a good idea. So I immediately started driving again. But she texted back in just a few minutes and she was understanding and didn’t mention it being unprofessional at all. After a few messages, she had found a co-worker for me to stay at let’s call her L. She also had a friend over for the night that use to work at the company too, so it was nice seeing him their and we played some MC as her boyfriend tried to join us, but wasn’t able to and ended up playing his own games for the night along side L. I think around 12 or 1 AM I decided to go to bed. They had let me use their spare bedroom, so way better than the couch I was asking for. The sleep, was wayyy better than in the back of my small suv. I had never lived in a city before, always rural. It was different listening to all the traffic noises, and with me being use to sleeping next to someone for so long. I think around 6:30 the next morning when I woke up, I left immediately. I drove around until 8, my ex said I was allowed whenever I wanted back in the house and she would appreciate it if I did so I could spend some time with our/her cats. From here I did spend 5 or so minutes with each cat. Playing with them and then crying. But I also had to prepare for work that day, and pack up some more of my stuff. That night after work, I ended up sleeping in my car again. Basically, I ended up thinking I was going to be staying at A’s place for the night as that’s how I read the messages. After messaging her, she asked if I could spend another night at L’s which I was understanding of and apologized for the bother and my bad for not reading the messages properly. Sometimes I can be a literal person, so that’s a fault of mine. And since I had mentioned to L that I had already gotten a place to sleep I didn’t want to bother her. So I slept in my car again, and the next morning my ex didn’t work so I didn’t want to visit the house. Instead I drove in my car until it was time to work, and after work I drove some more until I ended up sleeping in my car again. On the following day, I didn’t have work and neither did my ex. So I ended up driving all around probably another 500-700 miles. By this time, I’ve drove around 2,500 miles in my free time. Until like 8-9pm when I texted L asking if the bedroom was still open for a few days. She offered it to me the night I slept over, and said it was open whenever. She sent back that I could stay for as long as I needed as they felt bad for me in my current position. Honestly, it was hard the night staying there the first time. L and her boyfriend B had been together for I believe 5  years now. They were still very happy with eachother, they played games and joked around freely with eachother. Which I was not able to do really with my ex. They also played video games next to eachother, and it just reminded me of how me and my ex did that. So watching their happy relationship, with me being so depressed with my state it was hard. I do like to read/write in my free time and I do like love story’s. They are heartwarming, and remind me of being a kid. And seeing what they had, felt like I was definitely in the wrong for leaving my ex and not trying harder. But after a couple of days as mentioned, I knew I had a place I could sleep at I just had to reach out. I did, and then I ended up sleeping there for the next three weeks. During my first weekday back on the job, when A was visiting our department she offered me a hug and I gladly accepted. Knowing I didn’t have to fear my ex. I will talk about that part, but first. The hug was amazing, touch is definitely my love language, and since I’ve only been able to cry to myself in my car. The brief and professional hug, felt warming. Okay so let’s talk about this now… when I started at the company the interview went well and when I was hired on, I needed to take either a blood test or like this 8 panel allergic reaction test on the skin. Since I had never had my blood drawn, and I’m terrified of needles. Not because of my past exactly as I never used needles, but I had seen people do it and fuck is it scary. Anyways, I opted for the 8 panel allergic reaction test. A said that the test would show on the skin for a few days and will be more painful than the blood draw, then offered to hold my shoulder or hand if needed during it. This is when I kinda instinctively said “No it’s okay, I don’t want to do the blood draw.” And here’s the thing, I didn’t really realize until after. When she offered that, I know she was just being friendly and kind. But I knew, if my girlfriend were ever to find out that this girl held my hand or shoulder during a blood draw. There would be a problem. If I told her, that would have been fine with her for the most part I believe. But if she would have met her at a work party or something. I knew at home, I would pay for that. A is undeniable very pretty and smart. And I know my girlfriend would point out them facts, so I didn’t want to do the blood draw. Typing this out, makes me feel terrible. I had never thought of someone else other than my girlfriend before and this bothered me. Especially since this was a co worker, not one I would have to see everyday but still a co-worker and I was in a long term relationship of 7.5 years, yes it was toxic but it doesn’t make it right that I thought about idk protecting her from my girlfriend was not a good thought. Anyway, I was talked into the blood draw, and a nurse aid came into the room and seen I was struggling so didn’t ask she just put her hand on my shoulder and asked me questions about life. I basically told her I played a lot of games with my girlfriend, but on the left sitting in the desk was A. I wasn’t looking, but it felt like she was looking into me. I know I’m crazy, but that’s how it felt to me. So, let’s get the train sorta back on the rails. After the hug, my brain definitely wanted more and I suddenly wanted to ask so many questions. She had talked before about how she was single and was going out to drink to cope. But I didn’t ask, I didn’t want to become another weird guy. A girl just trying to be nice, and is mis-read by her first hire. Ooh yeah, theirs that too. She’s also newer at the company. I don’t know how recently she joined. So even though I knew I know had a crush on her, I shouldn’t tell anyone and keep it professional. But during the time I was staying at L’s we had gotten fairly close since I wasn’t really able to talk openly with my ex for so long so it was nice to able to just chat. Well since I have no other friends to mention it too, I told her one night. Started off over text, then she mentioned we should talk about it at the house and I agreed. After we talked, I agreed with how much I like the idea. I just didnt have the confidence and since my brothers fiancé also works at the company but her job actually requires training/schooling I didn’t want to mess up her career if my approach went bad. So even though she mentioned a few what ifs, I went in with the first couple before we got off topic. Since I told her about my feelings about A, I felt somewhat comfortable telling her in text about the interactions me and A would get somedays. Before the breakup, I never seen A on the same lunchtime as me. And probably only seen her three-four times a work week. After the breakup, my boss also left our department so A was filling in for that as well. So of course we would see eachother a bit more and chat a tiny bit. Honestly I was definitely really caged up and refused to let myself talk a lot about like anything because I didn’t want her to feel uncomfortable even though 80% of the time she was coming up to me to talk. And the other 20% if I needed to ask her something, I would just wait patiently until the next time she was in our department and I would look over to ask. Maybe once I approached her, but that would have been to go around her to grab items from storage. However, one time I noticed I already had the items I needed. But got extras because I was distracted, by talking about my new work schedule with A. That I returned after A left out department. So I did approach her one day, and I don’t feel like she didn’t appreciate it or found it inappropriate. But recently, we have had a new manager in our department again so cheers to that! But, now I have found myself on a couple lunch breaks, and a few vape breaks now with A. With co-workers around, but when we get a split moment alone it always seems like she would ask me how I’m doing with my housing situation, or in general. One time she offered to help me move, which I wanted too. But with all my stuff at my exs, and knowing how aggressive she could get at times. Andddd knowin I had a crush on A, I couldn’t let myself actually ask her for help. Instead when I picked up majority of my stuff from my ex, I did it in two trips instead of asking A or anyone else for help. Now she has is also moving into a new place, and I offered to help her if she needed. But as mentioned, I only have a small suv so I probably wouldn’t have been much help. She said thanks and we moved on to how hard it is moving, and talked about how she got her bed up the stairs by herself as we were walking back inside from a break. That was about a week ago. After I kept telling myself that I wanted to not go after her, everytime I seen her around work I wanted to say something to her everytime or give her a smile since my breakup a few people have mentioned how nice it is seeing me smile, and saying how nice my smile is. Not everytime I do say something as I know sometimes she’s walking with other employees or guests so that’s not appropriate. And sometimes when she looks like she’s busy, I don’t go out of my way to say hi. When we make eye contact, it’s great. I’m usually smiling, but then I will smile definitely bigger and I always get a smile back whether it’s big smile or a small smirk. But I don’t want to her to feel uncomfortable, especially talking to her for a tiny bit now. She’s got a kid, moving into her new place, and from what I can tell a great job. So I think she needs this job pretty badly, and she seems to be amazing at it. Other people at work talk about how they prefer to go to A since she’s kind and understanding. So I wouldn’t want to jeopardize her job with some dude trying to be weird at work. Also as mentioned my brothers fiancé also works here so I don’t want to jeopardize that. But ever interaction with A I just want to ask more and more questions. But they don’t come up. I’m socially awkward at times. Also as mentioned me and L have gotten close and texted frequently about life and work. Occasionally I would text her about the interactions with A I’ve had, and for the most part she would just be supportive but she also told me to watch out for myself as well. I definitely get attached quickly I am aware of that. But last Friday, I wasn’t prepared for anyone else besides the usual people to come back into my department. We also have music playing, and I was singing and slightly dancing. When I turned around to put in two pans full of food into the ovens, I almost dropped them. A was right there about to ask me a question, I about dropped the pans I was caught off guard. It seemed like she got a little laugh outta it and I really enjoyed making her laugh. Because in reality I am kind of a goofy personality at times so that is me, and she can find humor in that. After telling this and other things to L about A. She seemed to become slightly distant so I tried not using her name when talking about A. But I think I really fucked up. I was telling L two night ago about how I was just going to saying fuck it and ask if A would be interested in me. I have a very spotty past, don’t make a ton of cash, don’t have a ton of possessions, and only have a high school degree. I didn’t think A could seriously like someone like me that way, I’m kind of messy mentally. But since my brain thinks about her everytime I see her for about 15-20mins I just wanted to know if maybe she could see me like that in anyway. But since then, L has ghosted me. Kind of hurts since we talked about anything and everything for the last month. But after taking a day to think about what I said to her, maybe she could have taken things the wrong way and thought I was talking about her? But I’ve never felt them feelings for L even before I knew she had a boyfriend, she’s not my type and way to young. I would like a more mature, person who has lived life a bit and is ready to sorta settle down. I’m spontaneous at times so I understand going out every now and then. It’s now been two days left on read. I did send another message a few hours after the first one, basically using A’s name more. And apologizing for saying I would quit if I made things awkward for anyone there, I don’t wish to make things awkward or weird for anyone because of my own actions. But still no response. I haven’t worked the last two days either, and I have been browsing jobs and have found a few that I could probably start working at very soon. I sent out applications yesterday, and today Im visiting two other jobs go get some. Also I can work for my brother if need the cash. Not only should I quit as I can get jobs that pay like 50-75% more. But also I have made things awkward at work. And then for the final nail in the coffin, last night since I hadn’t talked to anyone in awhile. I heard one of my other co-workers tried it out, and they are now seemly happily engaged. I decided to try out FB dating for someone to talk with. It was like 11pm, so I wasn’t expecting anything. However after setting up my profile, THE FIRST PERSON THAT CAME UP WAS A. I was in shock, here was a chance for me not to be weird since I found her on a shared dating app. But like in person, I couldn’t swipe right or send a message. Instead I drove around for about an hour, smoked two larger joints when I got back to my apartment. Read some reddits on life and love. Mainly the good ones, life is too short. Make a move if you think theirs a connection. And others, I worked up my courage to swipe right on her profile. Then my heart fluttered I swear to god until 3am when I feel asleep. I woke up at 6:40, I don’t have a bed currently so sleeping already is kinda hard. I took a shower, bought a coffee. And by 8:30 I deleted my Facebook dating profile. I don’t know if she seen me swipe right, or if it will even display my name. But I do know, that I have made the workplace awkward to L which I told her I wouldn’t do. Still confused exactly on what though? And I don’t want to make the workplace awkward for A. She’s been incredibly kind to me, given me bonuses and extra hours to help me financially and since I was just barely able to get this tiny apartment it really mattered. But now I realizing how awkward I’ve made things, so after I post this. I’m going to wait until almost the end of the day and turn in my two weeks. It does really suck, working here might not pay the best. But the smiles and laughter I’ve had here has been the best. And seeing the smiles on the customers, im definitely going to miss that. I do have a tendency to overthink a lot, I have a lot of anxiety and some depression. So am I overreacting? 
TL;DR
So about 5 weeks ago I ended a toxic relationship for both of us. 4 weeks ago I moved in with a co-worker L temporarily. Also when I moved in, the next day of work I had a brief hug with A. Which I let develop into a crush. I’ve talked about it with L for a bit now, and I wasn’t using the best terminology and I think she thinks I was coming on to her maybe? And since she has stopped talking to me, I went on dating apps so I could talk to people. A was the first profile, so I swiped right after thinking about it. Now I’m the morning, I deleted my FB dating profile as I’m starting to think it wasn’t that professional of me to do. ",0,1747849489.0,tifu,48,0.14,False

the happiest year of my life was 2007 mainly because of a girl classmate I had a super crush on in 4th grade she moved that year to nevada because her mom died in a car accident. I still think about her after so many years her name was Alyssa. She was the most beautiful person I've ever seen in life to this day many years later 18 years later. I believe I saw her again in 2010 when I went to a Chuck E. Cheese or Peter Piper Pizza she and her family were departing in the parking lot and my mom was driving in the parking lot.

I realized in 2012 that I wasn't going to have a very good life

the moment I thought really hard about my future life was October 31, 2011 it was a Monday  that day I remember thinking I shouldn't have been born

I honestly believe I should have killed myself that day 10/31/11 If I knew the things about the present 

I wish I lived with my dad in mexico when he moved to see my Grandpa in 2008 I wished I had met my grandpa too. I recall the phone call conversation with my dad about my abuelo's passing he was so lonely and sad he lost his mom when he was a teenager he wasn't the same person after my abuelo died. 

If I had one wish in life it would have been to go back and live with my dad together in 2008 that would've made me a happier person I always thought he was the most interesting person I ever met certainly the biggest in my family circle.  

I remember thinking when I was diagnosed with adhd that I wasn't going to live to see 40 years old I had doubts about even living to 23 or 24 years old I was so depressed when I was 15 to 17 mainly because of my Eyesight frustration and not having seen my dad in a couple years I was angry about not seeing and visiting him. 

2015 to 2017 were the bullshit years of my life I wish I died in my sleep during those years but I regret not getting my GED or having a full time job during this time I had so much frustration and I contemplated killing myself every day during those years I hated myself so much I became numb I didn't have peace because I knew in 10 years I was going to die so I didn't care about my day to day during these years. 

My life changed a bit in 2018 I began to watch MLB baseball everyday It became my new hobby and limited my despair and desires of killing of myself I also started practicing gratitude like donating blood that helped my sanity.

my life became boring and meaningless in 2019 I had no purpose I wish my mom had kicked me out for being a bad son and not contributing with anything 

I started to change my feelings about my life in 2020 mainly because I needed cash to be independent but I didn't receive my first job opportunity till my 23rd bday in August after 9-10 months of applications. This continued in 2021 with Job interviews with starbucks and quiktrip that I didn't get 

I believed karma was coming up to me for being unemployed for a lot of years of doing nothing

I said fuck having a job I have no work ethic to begin with and I only care about the littlest things. This was February 2023 after I quit my day job doing drywall construction labor but I still wanted to leave and do things to move from my mom's house I stopped having a bank account in November 2023 but I wanted to work again so I downloaded that Job application Traba but I still haven't opened a new bank account.

I have spent the next two years entertaining myself with tv shows, movies, boxing Saturdays and baseball games and reading my favorite website Wikipedia about famous people's lives. I want freedom but I say what's the purpose if I'm going to die when I'm 26

My daily fridge routine got a little upgrade with the Waterdrop WD-F38 Replacement Filter. This refrigerator water filter boasts a sleek and compact design, measuring 2.2"" in diameter and 6.6"" wide, making it an unintrusive addition to my kitchen setup. What stood out immediately was the ease of installation. I didn’t need any tools to attach it properly—all it took was a few minutes and a glance at the included installation guide. It fits my refrigerator perfectly, without any leaks or loose fittings, which is a huge relief after dealing with those annoying drips from poorly-fitted filters in the past.

**Advanced Filtration for Fresh-Tasting Water**  
Testing the water from this filter made me appreciate it even more. Built with certified NSF 42 and NSF 372 standards, it effectively reduces dangerous impurities while making sure vital minerals that promote health are retained. My water transformed from barely tolerable to crisp and fresh in taste, even helping my coffee and tea feel much cleaner. Metals like chlorine and copper, as well as mercury and other contaminants (shoutout to cadmium and THMs), are filtered out thanks to the cutting-edge activated coconut carbon block material. It's satisfying to know that all this happens thanks to natural coconut shells sourced from Sri Lanka.  

[Check Waterdrop WD-F38 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0cx48zxk7/)  

**Key Benefits**  
- No leaks or loose attachments—fits like an OEM filter.  
- Removes harmful debris while retaining health-enhancing minerals.  
- The included installation stickers help to conveniently track filter lifespan.  

**Monthly Maintenance Made Simple**  
As someone who tends to slack on replacing filters until my water starts tasting off, the complimentary maintenance stickers included with the package are an absolute lifesaver. By easily keeping track of the 200-gallon or six-month lifespan of the filter, I'm better informed about when it’s time to replace it, depending on my water usage. Plus, I don’t have to second-guess if the water quality has started slipping over time. The forethought in including these stickers is one of those small perks I really love about using this filter.

**Strengths**  
- Highly efficient in reducing heavy contaminants (chlorine, mercury, VOCs, etc.).  
- Made with eco-friendly components like coconut carbon block.  
- Compact and tool-free installation adds to convenience.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- While efficient at removing contaminants, the filter doesn’t address all specific water issues, like reducing fluoride.  
- Some users might find the flow rate slightly slower compared to high-end filters.  

**Competing Products**  
Over the years, I’ve tried quite a few alternatives, from renowned Everydrop filters to more budget-friendly off-brand versions. Everydrop filters excel with high-quality certifications similar to this one, but they come with a heavier price tag. Some cheaper options often leave me stressed with poor fittings or are void of comprehensive certifications like NSF, giving this replacement an edge in reliability and affordability. Compared to other contenders, this product retains its focus on delivering clean water without the sky-high costs. While it doesn't completely match the rapid flow of its premium-priced counterparts, it definitely strikes a balance that works for me.

**Affordable Quality**  
We all want what’s good without breaking the bank. The WD-F38 delivers on all its promises, providing a well-rounded approach to high-functioning yet modestly-priced filtration solutions. While not the absolute cheapest option available, it’s packed with features that justify its cost-efficiency. Complimenting a reliable build and advanced materials are thoughtful details like installation aids, elevating it far above generic knockoffs. Plus, its pledge toward helping support water-scarce communities adds a deeper meaning to every dollar spent.

1ks42nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1ks42nb/does_tide_ultra_oxi_boost_liquid_laundry/,Does Tide Ultra Oxi Boost Liquid Laundry Detergent Deliver Powerful Cleaning Results Review?,"**Outstanding Cleaning Performance**

Trying out Tide 80740239 Ultra Oxi Boost Liquid Laundry Detergent felt like discovering a hidden gem for household chores. With its advanced formula, it tackled my laundry’s toughest stains like a pro. From chocolate smears on my kid’s school shirts to a coffee mishap on my favorite sweater, this detergent handled it all with ease. Its built-in pre-treaters really impressed me—working instantly to lift stains even without the extra elbow grease. I didn’t even need to add additional stain removers most of the time! Clothes came out of the wash visibly cleaner and with a vibrancy that seemed renewed.

**Long-Lasting Fresh Scent**

The original scent of this liquid detergent is subtle yet delightful. After a wash, my clothes smelled fresh for days, even when left folded in the closet. I threw in some kitchen towels that had absorbed persistent food aromas, curious to see its odor-eliminating potential, and they came out smelling as though they had never been near a kitchen. This scent is neither overpowering nor chemical-like, making it a pleasant choice for anyone sensitive to laundry fragrances.

**Tide’s Innovations & Effective Ingredients**

One of the standout features of this liquid detergent is the concentrated formula. You literally get more cleaning power in every drop. I tested its performance by using less detergent in my wash cycles, thinking it couldn’t sustain the same results with smaller doses—but I was wrong! Even with minimal use, the washing results remained impeccable. It's pre-packed with Tide's Power + Ultra Oxi combination, which not only obliterated stains but maintained the softness of my fabrics. Quite frankly, I feel like I’ve upgraded my laundry routine since using this.  

**Highlights**

- Built-in pre-treaters remove tough stains effortlessly.  
- Concentrated formula reduces detergent use, saving money and effort.  
- Combination of Tide Power + Ultra Oxi enhances cleaning power noticeably.  

**Packaging Design and Usability**

I loved how practical and well-thought-out the packaging is. With a tight cap that prevents spills and a bottle design that makes measuring and pouring easy, it’s clear Tide designed this product thinking about convenience. The 132-ounce size is generous, lasting through plenty of laundry cycles. However, holding such a large container can be slightly cumbersome, especially when the bottle is full. I’d recommend propping it securely in one place when pouring to avoid any strain or mess.  

**Shortcomings**

- Large bottle size may be too heavy for some users.  
- Some may prefer a fragrance-free option not included in this line.  

**Peer Products**

When comparing to competing liquid detergents, Tide Ultra Oxi Boost holds a strong edge in stain-fighting power and long-lasting freshness. Brands like Arm & Hammer or Persil come to mind as tough contenders, offering decent performance at competitive price points. That said, neither provided the same level of stain treatment without extra steps or additives. While Persil gives a comparable depth of cleaning, its scent didn’t quite match the fresh yet unobtrusive notes Tide offered. On the other hand, Arm & Hammer required using more detergent per cycle, making it less concentrated than Tide's offering.  

**Cost Efficiency**

For someone like me, who loves combining efficiency and quality, this detergent seemed worth every penny. Though slightly pricier than generic brands, its powerful concentration ensures you end up using less detergent per load. This not only balances out the cost but also reduces the frequency of needing to buy replacements. Furthermore, the level of stain removal was so remarkable that I no longer needed to buy separate cleaning boosters. It adds real value by simplifying the laundry process and saving time.

* Ashley Buchanan & Chandra Holt live together in a $3 million mansion in Texas.
* Michaels arts & crafts almost hired Holt for a senior position shortly after Ashley became their CEO. Ashley didn’t disclose their relationship.
* Ashley also didn’t disclose their relationship when Michaels started selling his girlfriend’s coffee.
* According to divorce filings, Ashley received $32 million when he sold Michaels to the private equity Apollo Global Management.
* “he had helped arrange a deal to sell Holt’s coffee products. Buchanan had dictated the payment terms, and the order was for hundreds of Kohl’s stores”
* “he caused Kohl’s to enter into a multimillion-dollar consulting agreement at Boston Consulting Group, where Holt was an adviser at the time.”

**Michael Bender**: Bender was the chairman of the board of directors when Kohl’s was searching for a CEO. He knew both Ashley Buchanan and Chandra Holt because all 3 were executives at Walmart. He claimed he didn’t know they had a relationship… but yet many Walmart executives knew about this. 

“Top executives at Michaels said they didn’t know the pair had a romantic relationship until more Walmart employees later joined the company, passing along gossip from Arkansas and as Buchanan’s divorce proceedings trickled into the open.”

Fortunately, I broke that myth with my current dentist who explained to me that it was very important and that I had to floss, she advised me to use a softer floss which I now use without any problems. The thing is, I've always had problems with my gums and for some reason at some point they start to swell and recently on one of my front teeth the gum has fallen a little and I can already see a difference, the dentist I had emigrated and the one who saw me today seemed quite lost, she took an x-ray and asked me to come back on Monday but my question is, could this still be insufficient hygiene around the gums, do I have to scrub more vigorously in that area? 
I don't smoke, my only vice is drinking coffee and I used to eat food that was too hot, which I changed some time ago, but I want to reverse this gum issue and I have no idea what could be wrong.
It's not the first time I've suffered from my gums, I've often had to go to the dentist as a matter of urgency because my gums were terribly swollen and painful.
Will an electric toothbrush make a big difference? Should I use a toothbrush near the gum area and try to clean it better, or irrigators for example?
I need to know what I'm doing wrong.

I recently went with one of my friends to a Spanish café and found myself in a bit of a blunder with my order. I was really wanting a latte in the sense of the Italian/English word (1:3 espresso:milk) but was completely unsure how to order it.

I ended up ordering just a simple ""café con leche,"" even though in my brain—and what I received—this usually means something like a drip coffee with a splash of milk. I settled with ordering that because I hate sounding linguistically confused ever since that time I was in Panamá and asked for a ""copa plástica"" when I wanted my drink to go, lol.

So my question is, would I be understood/correct if I simply said:

>""Me da un latte por fa""

Or would it be something more on the lines of:

>""Me da un café con leche espumada""  
""Me da un café con leche con espuma""  
""Me da un café con leche espumosa""

""Coffee, Miriam,"" I shout, and she answers from the hallway, her voice rich with warmth and laughter.
She joins me, hair pinned back, cardigan sleeves pulled to her elbows. We sit by the window, steam rising  between us. Outside, the neighbor's cat slips along the fence. The roses glow with dew. The two doves perch on the fence, side by side.
She brushes her thumb across the rim of her mug. 
""You'll water the roses?""
""I always do,"" I say. 
Before she leaves for her walk, she wraps her scarf, writes me a list of things to “ get done today” and places it in the empty cigar box my late father left me that lives on our fireplace. I kiss her cheek, always her left, and watch her disappear down the path. I grab the list from the box and hover my hand over the splintered edges reminiscing on my younger years. 
I water the roses. The doves coo at me. 

The next morning, the chipped mug waits again. I fill it slowly, steam rising like a choreographed dance. Miriam hums softly in the kitchen, moving with practiced ease. We share coffee, her eyes catching mine over the rim of her cup.
She pulls on her coat, bag slung over her shoulder. I open the door, the cold air quickly welcomed my cheeks snapping them like a rubber band. 
 ""Walk safe, Miriam,"" I say.
She smiles and nods, footsteps fading down the path.
The doves call softly outside. I water the roses, one petal curling slightly inward. The chair leans a fraction more to the left.
Later, I open the box and turn over the list for the day. I forgot a couple tasks on the list but Miriam doesn’t realise. 

Day folds into day, each one stitched with familiar threads. The chipped mug holds the same warm coffee, the garden breathes, she moves through the rooms like shadow and light, her presence steadying the days rhythm. She's is already moving about the house, soft footsteps in the hallway, the rustle of fabric as she folds the laundry.
""Coffee's ready Arthur” she calls from the living room.
Neighbors nod hello over the warping fence, a question in their depths left unspoken. At the corner shop, the cashier offers a gentle smile, fingers hesitating over the bag.
""I saw Miriam yesterday”
 she says quietly.
I nod, the words sticking somewhere just beyond reach.
At home, I open the box again, though I don't remember why and close it quick and sharp. Something smells like lavender. I go to bed. 

One morning, the chipped mug waits empty on the table. The kettle hums a tune I don’t know. Outside, the garden is quiet. The roses droop, petals pale. She pulls on her coat, slower now. I open the door but don't speak. Her smile is faint, and her eyes glass over staring through me.
The doves do not call.  The chair leans awkwardly, the cushion flattened.

 I water the roses, but the water spills, soaking the already drenched soil. 
The box sits closed, heavier on the fireplace. I rest my palm on its lid and forget what I am meant to do.

Another morning. The chipped mug is forgotten, cold. The kettle sits silent. She stands in the doorway, coat half on, waiting. I do not open the door.
She leaves without a word. The garden looks blurry past the glass. The chair is empty.
At the shop, the cashier's eyes cloud with concern. Mrs. Clarke's nod is slow, cautious.
At home, the box is open, but I don't know why.
Something inside it has been moved. I
trace the edges, wiping dust off the top of the box.
The garden is gone.
The chair stands empty.
The doves are silent.

I stand in the doorway watching the path where she walks, and I do not say goodbye.
I wait by the door with the mug in my hand, still warm, still hers,
but I cannot remember who I made it for.

I have slowly developed a chrush on her as we seem to have a lot in common, she seems like a wonderful person and I suspect she might be LGBTQ´+ as well (decorations in her home, books she owns, her love-everyone attitude and the way I have caught her outright starring at me a few times).

I have considered just asking her if she'd like to maybe get coffee sometime and maybe hang out without it being church related? I have considered sending her a message asking the same, which might work better because then she could reply when she is not working, but I want her to know  that the invitation is casual, that I just want to get to know her better. She seems a little shy in general, so I want to be careful that I don't make her uncomfortable.

1ks3ylu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ks3ylu/where_did_i_go_wrong_was_i_too_forwardor_is_it/,Where did I go wrong? Was I too forward—or is it just my weight?,"Hey everyone,

I am Male, 28 and I’ve been in Canada for about 3 years now. Between working full-time and driving part-time for Uber, I’ve stayed pretty busy—but deep down, I’ve really struggled with dating. I’ve never had a proper date here, and honestly, I think it’s a mix of two things: not having the confidence or social skills to ask someone out, and when I do try, I usually get rejected.

Backstory: I was stuck in a long-distance, toxic relationship for years. I never talked to or approached anyone else during that time, so I never learned how to actually date. After moving here alone, that gap in experience became really obvious.

Anyway—last month, I had a moment that gave me hope.

I picked up a girl while driving for Uber. She was super friendly and started chatting right away—talked about the nice weather, asked what I do, and even asked what my plans were for the week. She mentioned she’s new to the city and hasn’t explored much beyond that mall and asked about my schedule for the week. That felt like a subtle hint, like maybe she’d be open to hanging out. (I am professional to my work and I never ever asked any passenger since I started doing Uber, I don’t even look at them from rear view mirror)

When I dropped her off, I asked if she’d like to exchange numbers and maybe grab a coffee sometime. She smiled, thanked me multiple times, and I replied something like, “I really needed someone to hang out with too, so thanks for accepting.” (Looking back, maybe that was a bit too much too soon.)

Later, I texted her saying I enjoyed our conversation and hoped to see her soon. I had some work meetings for a couple days, then messaged her again and asked if she was free on the weekend. She replied that she’d be free next Tuesday or Wednesday. I said Wednesday works—asked her for a time—and then… silence.

I followed up on Wednesday—still no reply. A few days later, she texted saying she was packing and heading to the mall. We chatted a bit—she was buying gifts for her dad and for Mother’s Day. Then hours passed and she said again she was packing. I asked if she was traveling, and she said she was going to her parents’ place for the summer. She wished me a happy summer, I wished her the same, and that was it.

I’ve been thinking about this for days now. Did I say something wrong? Was I too forward? Too awkward? Or was she just being polite the whole time and I misread everything?

But if I’m being really honest… I feel like my weight is what’s holding me back the most. I’m overweight, and I know it affects how people see me—and how I see myself. Most of the rejections I’ve had seem tied to that. It’s killing my confidence, and even though I’m actively working on losing weight, it’s hard not to feel like people just don’t see past my appearance.

Do overweight people really not get a fair shot at dating? Or am I just overthinking this situation?
Would love to hear your perspective—what should I have done differently?

Thanks for reading.

1ks3yj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/StephenHiltonSnark/comments/1ks3yj8/some_thoughts_and_ideas/,Some Thoughts and Ideas,"Okay. I was up way too late thinking about this psychopath. And then when I woke up and tried to drink coffee and have a smoke, I see his post about driving recklessly through the Hills after kidnapping the kids. These are my thoughts. Please add/agree/disagree. Because I’m seriously f’ed up about it. I’ve dealt with bipolar mania episodes and it’s really surreal and crazy. On one hand, a person just thinks “okay they are being passionate or actually have an idea” because your brain wants everything to be okay, but then the other part is, “they are off their nut”. It is very conflicting for those closest to the manic person. But I digress. Here are my thoughts, in no particular order:

1) This is all a publicity stunt cooked up by him and Laura. The third book is coming out, both their engagement are way down after Laura dropped the comedy angle and they got divorced. So what’s a better way to show how drug addiction and mental illness ruins families than to show it in real time? - now this would take a lot of swallowing pride on both their parts, as well as having timed posts for Stephen for him to post at all hours of the night. He would have to make shitty music and pretend it’s the best thing out there, along with doing something vile like his r @ pe fantasies. And it’s a really long con. I don’t know if two people could play it off as long as they have, or as well. 

2) Stephen has kidnapped the kids and has either incapacitated Laura, broke into her home and stole the kids under threat and harm, or she let them go with him. It can be very hard for a woman who is always looking for male affirmations to say no to one, even if they are nuts. 

3) the pictures of A in the car is an old one he never posted, as well as him sleeping in the bed. He might have test drove the car before, or even rented it for his parents when they were in town. And he just wants to up his engagement and make money for his drug abuse. Plus it could be an easy way to make Laura come out of the woodwork to assure her fan base all is well 

4) because there was no custody in place, he had every right to take them. Parents cannot kidnap their own children, UNLESS they take them over state lines, out of the country or not in contact with the other parent for 24 hours. But how did he get them is the major question. She didn’t have to open the door. 

5) he’s against “big pharma” so we know he will never use something like lithium to be a productive member of society, and California has really relaxed drug laws. So what’s the end game? How does this all end? 

6) We know, all his simpers know, all his haters know, he doesn’t have money. The cat is out of the bag about what he actually did for actual musicians and movies (I did a deep dive into ALL OF IT last night…he just did synthesized sounds over the actual music. That’s it. He didn’t write/produce/consult anything. None of the bands know his name. He was one of many on numerous projects. With Depeche Mode, he was the only one to do the synthesizing, but that was seriously ages ago. He doesn’t even get royalties from sales or downloads of the songs. He has no stake in Laura’s business, his name isn’t on the houses. So either he has some funds from his parents, a trust fund, or Laura is funding his “lifestyle”. But if he is even making $5000 a month from online stuff, he doesn’t pay rent, I don’t know what utilities are in LA but I’m guessing he’s not spending more than a $1000 a month on it. Food/gas (not that he leaves the house) probably another $500. So he can def live okay on the $3500 he has left a month, for now. I live in a “affluent” area (ie expensive af). $3500 for just having to spend on drugs is a lot of money. Even if he’s doing heroin, it’s not expensive. $50 a day usually is enough for a person. Even if he’s spending $100 a day, that’s only $3000. 

7) My guess how it all ends, one day they will both stop posting, or post but act like none of this never happened. Videos/posts will disappear and we will be made to forget any of this ever happened. ",4,1747849080.0,StephenHiltonSnark,10,1.0,False

The Marine Park Young Adults Association is a community-driven social group for young adults ages 18–35 in southern Brooklyn that has registered as a nonprofit with the State and will soon be filing as a 501(c)(7) non-charitable nonprofit. Our mission is to create spaces where young people can make meaningful connections through fun events, creative activities, and impactful community service projects. From movie nights and murder mystery parties to concerts and volunteer work, we’re all about bringing people together and giving back.

Climate Cafe South Brooklyn builds on that mission—offering a relaxed, welcoming space for everyone, regardless of age, to come together and talk about climate change in a supportive, non-judgmental environment. It’s not a lecture or a seminar—it’s a conversation. Whether you’re feeling anxious, inspired, confused, or just curious, you’re welcome.

Our first Climate Cafe is happening Saturday, June 7th at Marine Park Coffee at 1 PM. Come join us, grab a drink, and take part in a community that cares deeply about people and the planet.

Feel free to connect with us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/climatecafesouthbrooklyn!

Please let us know if you would like to be a speaker for a future Climate Cafe as we need scientists, climate informed therapists, and other professionals to speak on the climate crisis, and please let us know if you have any ideas for places we could have Climate Cafes in the future as we would like to start meeting in other neighborhoods in southern and central Brooklyn!",1,1747849050.0,prospectheights,0,1.0,False

I know that there are some cars that sit low and could scrape, and some folks haul things that could fall off or be damaged if jostled too much. However, for the most part, I'm seeing this done by folks in newer-looking cars that often sit high (like a Jeep) or at the very least high enough off the ground that they probably couldn't scrape even if they were speeding, with nothing visible that could fall off or out of their vehicle. I don't think it's reasonable to assume that all of these people have hot coffees with no lids in their laps.   
  
I just have been genuinely curious about this and wonder if anyone who does this can provide some insight into why they do it. 

I won't lie and say it doesn't bother me when I'm behind them and can't see an obvious reason (like a low vehicle), but I think I would be less bothered if I understood why. I've been questioning myself a bit wondering whether I should be doing the same thing since so many people seem to do it. Maybe knowing some of the reasons will convert me, lol.

1ks3uhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ks3uhn/how_much_affection_is_normal_in_a_healthy/,How much affection is normal in a healthy relationship?,"Me  '36f' and my boyfriend '39m' have been together off and on for 5 years. After year 1 we split up for 2 years after infidelity on his part but I will admit that the relationship was ending already before that for months,  I had rushed into the relationship too quickly after a terribly toxic abusive 10 year relationship and neither of us was really at a healthy place to be starting anything. We both did alot of personal- growth and 2 years ago started talking again from different states and officially been dating again for almost a year. When we were first together 5 years ago he was much more affectionate but still just not a super affectionate man which was odd to me because very different than the first time.  He couldn't keep his hands off me especially in the begining. I was able to move past the infidelity but it obviously caused some insecurity in the relationship. For the past year we have had the same issue. Lack of affection and intentional effort to feed into me and actively give me love. He barely touches me sometimes. He's gone 3 days before without touching me intentionally. We weren't fighting or anything. We have talked about this alot. Iv expressed my need to feel loved in small ways daily. I feel like the issue is lack of intentional effort Into learning what I need and giving it to me. He is great at acts of service but all the other love languages are pretty much non existent. I feel like my love cup is empty. I think it's important to say that he has a dismissive avoidant attachment style and mine is anxious attachment. He was raised with very few examples of healthy relationship whereas I was surrounded by them but felt neglected or abandoned which was exacerbated by my previous abusive relationship. We both know how hard a relationship like this is but we are committed to working through it. I feel like I dont even know if he likes me half the time,  my emotions seem like a burden and overwhelming to him which makes me feel abandoned, neglected and like I'm too much or not enough. He feels like anytime I ask for my needs it's a personal attack on him and that he can never do anything right. I have tried many many ways of approaching this and I feel like at this point im begging for what to me is normal and should be natural behavior in a romantic relationship. He doesnt seem to understand and says we live together he goes to work, comes home, doesnt do anything weird. We do spend time but it's not ever like dates or intentionally to build the relationship. He's not the type of man to give verbal affirmations hes not big on romantic gestures, occasionally will get me flowers but typically I have to hint big. The one love language he is really good at is acts of service. My top ones are physical touch and qaulity time although I need all of the them. I have had to establish that when he leaves I need to be given physical touch and say goodbye. He mostly does it but only if hes leaving for awhile and if I dont initiate it's a hit or miss if he will I initiate. We had a disagreement yesterday and one of the things was that I think it weird that he doesnt give me any affection or even acknowledge me sometimes in the morning. In my experience a typical couple would cuddle a little in the morning and say good morning. I used to initiate and he started to expect it but I get tired of being the only one seeking him out and if I dont he probably wont. It adds to the overthinking that if he really loves me and wants to be with me he would want to do these things naturally. I mean it's hard to admit but he hasn't kissed me like really romantically kissed me since the first year of our relationship, other than a peck on the lips to say goodbye. Im trying to get him to understand that it's the small acts of love that build a strong foundation of security and trust and it's a must. He us saying that maybe my expectations are too high. This came to head in an argument about morning greetings. I say it's normal when you wake up to be a little affectionate and say good morning. Yesterday he woke up first and went down stairs, I woke up and didnt see him and started getting ready. He came uo at one point to grab something and didnt say anything. OK maybe rushing fur some reason but he didnt have to work for a couple hours. So when I was done I was walking down the stairs as he was walking up. First time we are really seeing eachother. I stepped over a little so he could pass and he just walked by avoiding touching me. I said goodmorning and he just said mhm. Not rudely just nonchalant. I think that's probably a good description of his general way of treating me, kinda non chalant but fondly. It just made me feel invisible and it's not just this incident it's everything adding up. I feel like a burden and just cant understand why or how someone who says the are in love with me doesnt have the natural urge to want you show me love. So if you made it this far thanks. I dont want this to ruin our relationship and be the end of it so please give me your opinions and advice on 2 things. 1. Is it typical for couple to great eachother affectionately in the morning or is a simple acknowledgement  more the expectation. 2. What small ways throughout the day do you show or receive love that are normal things in a relationships? For example, telling them they look nice, holding hands while walking or driving, brushing hair out of your face, making your coffee etc. I know that im missing it but it's hard for me to put into words what it is when I say the small day to day things that typically people who are romantically incolved do naturally to connect.

1ks3tew,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1ks3tew/my_partner_27m_and_i_22f_have_had_this_argument/,My partner [27M] and I [22F] have had this argument at least 4 times in our 4 year relationship. Please help!,"Hi all. This is very long so I deeply appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and offer me some advice and/or criticism. I’ve had this argument multiple times with my partner and I always leave it confused and not sure what just happened. 

I (22F) have bipolar disorder have gone through extensive therapy and am on mood stabilizers which have tremendously helped with my depressive episodes and mood swings. I think this is important to mention for context. I think I’ve made great progress but this argument puts me back into a very negative headspace so maybe I’m missing something. However, what I’ve learned from therapy is that I am someone who outwardly expresses my emotions and I am not the type to keep them inside. This doesn’t mean that I have angry outbursts where I get violent or yell horrible things and I have never directed negative feelings toward my partner or yelled at them during any arguments. When I say I express emotions outwardly I mean that if I’m upset I let out breaths or I’ll say a cuss word if something spills, i’ll cuss if something inconvenient happens and I’m in a rush, or I’ll yell out an insult at someone who cuts me off in traffic etc.. Essentially, when I’m frustrated I’m not quiet about it. This is the same for when I’m happy or excited. I express it fully and it’s very clear that I’m excited or passionate about a story or something going on. I also do this when I tell him about family drama, friend drama, or stuff that happens at work. I’m also very anxious and very much enjoy time at home or doing things by myself. If I’m not interested in something or my social battery is gone, it is clear. 

Now, that is all important background info on this argument that we’ve had multiple times. My partner is almost opposite of me and I’ve come to understand that his experiences growing up have led him to withhold expressing emotions and he’s constantly trying to keep peace. He’s very calm and doesn’t ever seem to get upset or have outward reactions to things like I do. He’s also very active and wants to do spontaneous things daily. Spontaneity is not something I love due to my anxiety and I very much like to have a plan so I can plan out my day and other tasks/chores I need to get done so I don’t get overwhelmed later. I try to go along with his activities especially if he seems excited about them. 

This argument usually starts off with a comment or energy from him when I’m not seemingly enjoying something, I’m not very talkative, or I’m outwardly expressing a frustration. For example, I’m not a morning person and I generally don’t want to talk much for at least 30 minutes after I wake up. I’m not angry or anything, I just need time to adjust and get my thoughts sorted and have coffee etc. I’ve been told by him that this creates a hostile environment for him and that it makes him anxious. This goes for other times where I outwardly expressing emotions. He says I make him anxious and ruin the vibe and now he’s not having fun. He also says that he gets frustrated that I’m not planning things or doing more hobbies or fun things etc.. When I hear this stuff I feel lame, boring, and overdramatic. Which I’ve expressed in these arguments. It makes me quite upset and makes me feel even more anxious and self conscious about myself. It also makes me question if I’ve made any progress in therapy or if I’ll forever be ruined by my mental health issues and ultimately ruin a wonderful relationship. 

I also feel I should mention that I work a full time job 8-5 during the week and  4 to 8 hours on the weekend at a part time job. I’m often tired at the end of the day during the week and also end up having a significant amount of chores and tasks I need to complete on the weekend. He also works full time and has some side hustles but he works from home most days and has a significantly less stressful job than I do. I don’t want to discredit him, he does work very hard but he also has more time to himself than I do. I love my job but I can also see that it makes it harder to do things like maintain self care, go to the gym, see friends/family, and also do things with him. Obviously this is a struggle for many people. 

Anyway, this argument ends up going around in circles where I try to explain that I feel misunderstood and that we express ourselves differently and that shouldn’t be an issue and that it makes me feel very discouraged, judged, and like he wants me to be like him. He then says that’s not his intention and it just makes him sad when I’m not happy. I then explain that it’s unrealistic to expect me to be happy at all times and not get frustrated and that our relationship/he should be a safe place for me to express myself as long as I’m not directing it at him. I’ve told him multiple times that I don’t expect him to fix anything when I get frustrated or anxious and that I just need to go through some mindfulness to get me grounded again or maybe I just need to say f*** and move on with my day without feeling like I’ve ruined something. Now anytime i get frustrated I feel like I need to suppress it in order to keep him happy and that just doesn’t seem fair to me. 

Overall, I simply don’t know what to say or how to fix this because I’m so tired of having this same argument over and over again. I feel like i must be missing something. He says he wants to do more things with me and I can absolutely see that I can put more effort into planning things but I’ve also asked for him to plan more things as well instead of telling me an hour or two beforehand that we’re going out or doing this or that. I also feel like some other things are lacking for me and some needs aren’t being met but I’m not sure how to express it. Anyway please help me see what I’m missing and how I can keep this from messing up our relationship and what I should do. Thanks ",1,1747848740.0,relationshipadvice,3,1.0,False
1ks3sdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ks3sdg/where_do_i_go_from_here/,Where do I go from here?,"I made a previous post and then deleted it before anyone commented. I keep coming back looking for some form of clarity.  
  
My girlfriend (ex?) of 6.5 years went to work two weeks ago and never came home. She sent me a text that afternoon that she was feeling detached and that it had been growing over time. She said she felt guilty about this but needed space and was going to leave to stay with her sister. I tried to give her space but after three days I couldn't take it and reached out. I sent a message talking about everything we've gone through together over the years and that we could get through anything. 

She responded with a ChatGPT generated message that she's been thinking about this for awhile and that she hasn't felt fully understood or met on an emotional level. She said she had tried to help make those connections in ""quiet ways"" but they never seemed to catch and that emotional vulnerability she's needed to see in me has only showed up in times of crisis. She said she's reached a point where she needs to try a different path and understand who she is outside of this. That I haven't done anything wrong and am a good man.

I went into survival mode and tried to plead for 3 days on how I could communicate better so I could meet those needs. I sent flowers and long messages about how I can work on myself and us. She responded just a couple times with that she's said what she had to say for now and then stopped reading my messages. One of the last messages I sent asked if this was really over. I've stopped sending anything 6 days ago to give her the space she wants, despite it killing me.

To give some back story we've been dating since late 2018. We moved in together in 2020 when we lived on the east coast. Her mother and younger siblings all relocated out west shortly after. After living together for 1.5 years she wanted to move to be closer to them. We made it work long distance for over a year while I looked for a new job and got my house sold. I left everything behind for her and we bought a house together in the suburbs of a major city. We've been in the house for 1.5 years. She didn't seem like herself the last couple weeks, with the last week being the most distant.

Aside from job dissatisfaction (she hasn't made as much money since moving out here as she used to) and hating her commute. I thought we were overall happy. I'm full time remote work and she was on a 50/50 schedule, so we were together often. We used to go out all the time but were both gaining weight so we scaled that back in recent months. We both had been focusing on exercising and eating healthy. For the last month or so when I would ask if she wanted to go out somewhere she would tell me she'd rather stay in. She'd say that she didn't want the extra calories or she liked the cocktails I made better and we didn't have to spend $15 each on them.

We both have always had avoidant tendencies when it came to talking about problems. We rarely fought, which I realize now was a problem in of itself. I've spent the last 2 weeks reading everything I could on communication and attachment styles. Trying to learn ways that I can meet her emotional needs.

We own a house together. We have a pet dog who she's joked she would die for. Most of her stuff is still here. She hasn't blocked me on social media or even changed our relationship status. Before I realized I needed to give her space though, her posts were all going out in the city with her sister. I've since forced myself to try to stay off social media, or at least her pages.

I travel for work every few months and she knows when my next trip is. I don't know if she's just going to come and get her things when she knows I'm gone. I work remote and all of my friends and family are 2000 miles away. The silence in the house is killing me. The thought of losing her is killing me.

I'll admit I don't wear my heart on my sleeve but I thought she saw the acts I did for her. I cooked dinner for her every night. I'd get up with her every morning before she had to leave for work and do anything to help her out the door. Sit with her and have coffee. Give her a kiss and tell her I love her every morning on the way out the door and night before we went to bed. I took her car to get gas for her. I cleaned the house, did dishes, and took care of the laundry. I covered the household bills and mortgage. I paid when we went out. We loved going to concerts together. We had ones we both enjoyed but would go to ones that the other also wanted to go see. We watched bad horror movies she wanted to see and make cocktails and laugh together on the weekends. 

I thought I showed affection, we'd hold hands while walking and even driving. I'd gently touch her as she walked by. I'd rub her feet that she put up on my lap. Take a deep inhale of her hair when we hugged. I'd rub her back as she sat beside me.

I don't know what I'm expecting from posting this. It's more just to get everything off my chest. But, where do I go from here? Each day of silence brings me closer to realizing she might be gone forever.",2,1747848671.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False
1ks3s6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ks3s6u/rfgetting_older/,[RF]Getting Older,"The light comes in as it always does, slow through the lace curtain. I reach for the chipped mug. It's where I left it, beside the window where the sun lives longer.
""Coffee, Miriam,"" I shout, and she answers from the hallway, her voice rich with warmth and laughter.
She joins me, hair pinned back, cardigan sleeves pulled to her elbows. We sit by the window, steam rising  between us. Outside, the neighbor's cat slips along the fence. The roses glow with dew. The two doves perch on the fence, side by side.
She brushes her thumb across the rim of her mug. 
""You'll water the roses?""
""I always do,"" I say. 
Before she leaves for her walk, she wraps her scarf, writes me a list of things to “ get done today” and places it in the empty cigar box my late father left me that lives on our fireplace. I kiss her cheek, always her left, and watch her disappear down the path. I grab the list from the box and hover my hand over the splintered edges reminiscing on my younger years. 
I water the roses. The doves coo at me. 

The next morning, the chipped mug waits again. I fill it slowly, steam rising like a choreographed dance. Miriam hums softly in the kitchen, moving with practiced ease. We share coffee, her eyes catching mine over the rim of her cup.
She pulls on her coat, bag slung over her shoulder. I open the door, the cold air quickly welcomed my cheeks snapping them like a rubber band. 
 ""Walk safe, Miriam,"" I say.
She smiles and nods, footsteps fading down the path.
The doves call softly outside. I water the roses, one petal curling slightly inward. The chair leans a fraction more to the left.
Later, I open the box and turn over the list for the day. I forgot a couple tasks on the list but Miriam doesn’t realise. 

Day folds into day, each one stitched with familiar threads. The chipped mug holds the same warm coffee, the garden breathes, she moves through the rooms like shadow and light, her presence steadying the days rhythm. She's is already moving about the house, soft footsteps in the hallway, the rustle of fabric as she folds the laundry.
""Coffee's ready Arthur” she calls from the living room.
Neighbors nod hello over the warping fence, a question in their depths left unspoken. At the corner shop, the cashier offers a gentle smile, fingers hesitating over the bag.
""I saw Miriam yesterday”
 she says quietly.
I nod, the words sticking somewhere just beyond reach.
At home, I open the box again, though I don't remember why and close it quick and sharp. Something smells like lavender. I go to bed. 

One morning, the chipped mug waits empty on the table. The kettle hums a tune I don’t know. Outside, the garden is quiet. The roses droop, petals pale. She pulls on her coat, slower now. I open the door but don't speak. Her smile is faint, and her eyes glass over staring through me.
The doves do not call.  The chair leans awkwardly, the cushion flattened.

 I water the roses, but the water spills, soaking the already drenched soil. 
The box sits closed, heavier on the fireplace. I rest my palm on its lid and forget what I am meant to do.

Another morning. The chipped mug is forgotten, cold. The kettle sits silent. She stands in the doorway, coat half on, waiting. I do not open the door.
She leaves without a word. The garden looks blurry past the glass. The chair is empty.
At the shop, the cashier's eyes cloud with concern. Mrs. Clarke's nod is slow, cautious.
At home, the box is open, but I don't know why.
Something inside it has been moved. I
trace the edges, wiping dust off the top of the box.
The garden is gone.
The chair stands empty.
The doves are silent.

I stand in the doorway watching the path where she walks, and I do not say goodbye.
I wait by the door with the mug in my hand, still warm, still hers,
but I cannot remember who I made it for.

This is The Station 13 — a tale where characters remember, writers interfere, and questions outlive answers.
Carl, broken, bloodstained, and lost, returns to the bench where it all began… but this time, he’s not alone.
A man in gray. A cigarette. A truth too ugly to look at.
He calls himself The Narrator.
But he’s more than that.
He’s a mirror. A wound. A voice that was never supposed to speak — but did.
And Carl? He just wanted to forget. For an hour.

This monologue dives into identity, fate, and the strange relationship between the author, the narrator, and the character.
If you love dark metaphors, meta-narrative games, and raw emotion wrapped in cigarette smoke… you might want to read this one slowly.
Word by word.
Like it was whispered by someone who shouldn’t exist.
But does.

Monologue : 

The Narrator’s gone.  
So I’ll be your voice now.  
You should probably get used to that.  
  
Sorry—  
I forgot to introduce myself.  
I’m the writer.  
Yeah… that one. The name on the cover.  
  
No fancy words here.  
Let’s keep it raw.  
  
Carl walks to Station 13—  
the place where he first saw the woman he loved.  
He sits.  
Same bench. Same number.  
It’s always Bench 13, no matter how you look at it.  
Symbolic, huh?  
But hey, I didn’t write that part.  
I’m just reading what was already written.  
  
Carl sits there…  
and cries.  
It’s past midnight.  
No stars.  
Even the sky couldn’t bear to watch him break.  
  
Then — cold.  
That kind of cold you don’t feel on your skin…  
you feel it in your gut.  
  
A man approaches.  
Slow. Unclear at first.  
Closer now —  
Wait.  
That man…  
Damn him.  
  
Sorry. I wasn’t supposed to say that.  
But still—damn him.  
He wasn’t even in my damn script.  
Maybe that’s why he left.  
Tired of reading lines for everyone else,  
but never getting his own.  
  
He’s in a long gray coat.  
Matching hat.  
Brown pants, brown shoes.  
Hat pulled just low enough to blur the face—  
but that grin…  
yeah, that you can see.  
  
He sits beside Carl.  
Takes out a cigarette.  
  
“Want one?”  
  
Carl doesn’t answer. Just lowers his head.  
  
“No cigarettes, no whiskey… not even a curse unless Walter’s yelling.”  
“Even when you make a choice, you only think for five minutes.”  
“You’re amazing, Carl.”  
  
Carl looks up — stunned.  
  
Carl: “You… how do you know that? Tell me the truth!”  
Narrator: “Truth’s bitter. That’s why most people take their coffee sweet… and their lives with lies.”  
  
“You and I, Carl… we’re alike.”  
“Maybe it’s not even us. Maybe Fate just has issues.”  
  
Carl: “Who are you?”  
Narrator: “Funk or jazz? Or maybe pop?”  
Carl: “What? Just—answer me—”  
Narrator: “Why’d you love Amy?”  
Carl: “Who the hell are you?”  
Narrator: “When did you first meet Walter?”  
Carl: “What—what are you doing?!”  
Narrator: “Was Amy’s face a reminder of your dead mother?”  
  
Carl: “Why do you keep answering questions with more questions?!”  
Narrator: “Finally—a real question.  
See, Carl… answers rot.  
They change.  
They fade.  
But questions?  
They evolve. They stay.”  
  
Carl: “Who are you?!”  
Narrator (softly): “No one’s ever asked that before.”  
Carl (shouting): “Answer me!”  
Narrator: “Easy, boy.  
I forgot who I used to be.  
Now they call me The Narrator.  
My friends call me that.  
Well—what’s left of them.  
I tell stories.  
Yours… is different.”  
  
Carl: “You have friends?”  
Narrator: “Concepts, mostly.  
And the graves of the stories I’ve already told.”  
  
Carl lowers his head.  
  
Then—asks, shaken:  
  
Carl: “If you’re The Narrator… and you’re here…  
then who the hell is telling the story?”  
  
Narrator: “Good question. That idiot author who only wrote five lines of plot.  
I wrote the rest.  
A boring little script:  
‘You come. You cry. You leave.’  
But that’s crap, right?  
Even this version is dull.  
Because it’s just me talking…  
and you sitting there, looking like a backup actor in a one-man show from hell.”  
  
Carl stares — confused, lost.  
  
Narrator (calm again):  
“You know Carl, a coin has two sides.  
Victory. Defeat.  
Life or death.”  
  
He flips a coin.  
It vanishes mid-air.  
  
“See, Carl…  
I don’t even care how it lands anymore.”  
“But you—  
you intrigue me.”  
  
He flips another.  
It lands upright. Balanced.  
  
Narrator: “Now that…  
that doesn’t happen.  
Not where I’m from.”  
“Even Fate is confused by you.”  
“And me?  
I adore the faithless.”  
  
He points to Carl’s bloodstained clothes.  
  
“You used to have this spark in your eyes.”  
“Now look at us.”  
  
He pulls Amy’s white scarf from his coat — stained red.  
  
“Five seconds, Carl.”  
“That’s all it took.”  
“Five seconds of hesitation.”  
  
Carl: “You… you…”  
  
Narrator (laughs): “No lines were written for you here.  
I guess that’s the irony.”  
  
Carl: “I don’t care about lines.  
I want the truth.”  
  
The Narrator freezes. Surprised.  
  
Narrator: “Say that again?”  
“You?  
You never wanted truth.”  
  
A beat. Then:  
  
“Alright, Carl…  
I’ll show you the truth from my perspective.”  
  
“Truth is like an old woman screaming in the street.”  
“But people are too busy listening to their favorite lie on cassette tapes.”  
“Or they just run from her.”  
  
“She once asked me,  
‘Why do you keep chasing me?’”  
“I said,  
‘Because everything else is a lie.’”  
“She said,  
‘And what about you?’”  
“…I couldn’t answer.”  
“Because it was a lie too.”  
  
“She ruined me, Carl.  
Beautifully.  
But I don’t show it.”  
  
“Truth is cruel only because it’s honest.  
The kind of honest that rattles your bones.”  
“She’s a mirror —  
but she always tilts at the wrong angle.”  
  
“Most people say they want her.”  
“But if they ever catch her…  
they panic.  
They don’t know what to do with her.”  
  
“So, Carl…”  
“Are you still chasing the truth?”  
  
Carl doesn’t answer.  
  
Narrator: “Just five seconds, Carl.  
You’ve always had a timing problem.”  
  
He stands.  
Train whistle in the distance.  
Smoke creeps in.  
  
And like that —  
he vanishes.  
  
But his voice lingers:  
  
“Whatever you choose, Carl…  
I’ll be waiting.”  
  
The train departs.  
  
On the bench:  
A red lighter.  
A cigarette pack labeled “5 Seconds.”  
And a note:  
  
> “You know, Carl —  
numbers are fate.  
But no one sees them that way.  
Light a cigarette.  
It’s not a sin.  
Not for people like us —  
people who just want to forget,  
for an hour.”  
  
  
  
Carl stares at the note.  
Then whispers:  
  
“Damn him.  
He knew everything.”  
  
He lights the cigarette.  
And yes—  
you already know.  
  
That was The Narrator.

I called him Skitty as he was very skittish when I tried to catch him in my spider catching tin 😅 (large open metal cylinder that I try to gently coax spoods in with a soft brush)

My bf isn't a fan of spoods so I normally catch any uninvited guests and show them the door (bushes outside) before he can see them. I was going to do the same for Skitty here but when I got him in the tin I noticed he had a leg missing and felt bad for him. So, I improvised an enclosure out of a coffee jar (thoroughly cleaned beforehand & air holes put in the lid) with some coconut soil I had left over for my plants and a little hut for him made out of part of an egg carton. 

He's made himself at home with a web in there and I've fed him (which he snatched up with no hesitation before looking out the window with his meal) 

I'm wondering a few things. 
1. What kind of spood is he? (I'm in the UK)
2. Is this enclosure big enough? Should I invest in something bigger if I keep him?
3. Will his missing leg affect his quality of life? Should I set him free? Will he survive without it?
4. Any other pro tips welcome. I'm fairly new to liking spoods. Up until a couple of years ago I used to be frightened of them but now I find them adorable & misunderstood. 🕷❤️",5,1747848261.0,spiders,0,0.86,False

The Marine Park Young Adults Association is a community-driven social group for young adults ages 18–35 in southern Brooklyn that has registered as a nonprofit with the State and will soon be filing as a 501(c)(7) non-charitable nonprofit. Our mission is to create spaces where young people can make meaningful connections through fun events, creative activities, and impactful community service projects. From movie nights and murder mystery parties to concerts and volunteer work, we’re all about bringing people together and giving back.

Climate Cafe South Brooklyn builds on that mission—offering a relaxed, welcoming space for everyone, regardless of age, to come together and talk about climate change in a supportive, non-judgmental environment. It’s not a lecture or a seminar—it’s a conversation. Whether you’re feeling anxious, inspired, confused, or just curious, you’re welcome.

Our first Climate Cafe is happening Saturday, June 7th at Marine Park Coffee at 1 PM. Come join us, grab a drink, and take part in a community that cares deeply about people and the planet.

Feel free to connect with us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/climatecafesouthbrooklyn!

Please let us know if you would like to be a speaker for a future Climate Cafe as we need scientists, climate informed therapists, and other professionals to speak on the climate crisis, and please let us know if you have any ideas for places we could have Climate Cafes in the future as we would like to start meeting in other neighborhoods in southern and central Brooklyn!",1,1747848237.0,sheepsheadbay,0,1.0,False

1ks3gw7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ks3gw7,38M. Almost 1 year of exercise. Started at 175->185->170. Need help to find my balance. lol,"I started working out last July. I went ahead and tried gaining weight around October and was pushing 190 by Christmas. I started reducing and cutting in February. I’m happy with my results but I do feel like I need more definition. In my head and in the future, I would like to be bigger. But as of now, I just want to look and feel better. I guess I don’t have clear defined goals and need some opinions on where to go. 

Me and my wife are going on our first vacation without children this year and it was enough motivation to get me to really push hard this last month. But now I’m starting to feel a little burnt out.

Right now I’m doing a 5 day split. Chest/shoulders, Legs/HITT, Arms/core, Cardio/HITT, back/core. I work out at home, 5AM which is the only time I have to myself. I have a set of dumbbells and a bench and do bodyweight stuff. I don’t have a pull up bar but it’s on my list. Maybe some kettlebells. My sleep is not bad but it definitely could be better.

Diet is mostly clean. I do the occasional fast food. We do have three kids so dinners are pretty wild at times. But I would say I’m 75-80% consistent with diet.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

People say it can boost your energy, sharpen your mind, and help your body run better. With so many glowing reviews, I couldn’t help but wonder: could this actually be the answer I was looking for? So, I decided to try MITOLYN myself for three whole months—even though it wasn’t cheap! I wanted to see if it would really make a difference in my life. Here’s my honest MITOLYN review and everything you need to know if you’re thinking about giving it a shot.

**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

For as long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with feeling tired all the time. No matter how much I slept, I’d wake up groggy and stay sluggish all day. My brain felt foggy, and I’d lose focus so easily—even on things I enjoyed! I also noticed I was gaining weight, my motivation was slipping, and my mood was all over the place.

I tried everything I could think of: drinking more water, getting more exercise, even following advice from popular health gurus online. I bought fancy vitamins and tried weird diets, but nothing really helped for long. It felt like my body just wasn’t working right, and I was getting more frustrated every day.

That’s when I stumbled across MITOLYN. I saw so many people raving about it online, and I thought, “Maybe this is finally something that will help.”

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was actually impressed right away. The box looked really nice and modern—not flimsy or cheap. The instructions were super clear, and it was easy to see how much to take and when. There was even a little card inside with tips and encouragement, which made me feel like the company really cared about my results.

I was also happy to see that the ingredients list was simple and didn’t have anything weird or artificial. I’ve tried products before that were packed with stuff I couldn’t pronounce, but MITOLYN’s formula looked clean and trustworthy.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I didn’t expect to feel different right away. Most supplements take weeks or months to show any effect, and I was ready to be patient. But, to my surprise, I started to notice little changes just a few days after starting MITOLYN.

First, I had more energy in the morning. I didn’t feel like I was dragging myself out of bed. My brain felt less foggy—I could focus better at work and even remember little things like where I left my keys! By the end of the first week, I realized I wasn’t reaching for coffee every couple of hours. My energy lasted longer and felt much more natural.

As the days went by, my mood improved, too. I felt less stressed and more upbeat. My cravings for junk food went down, and I even started enjoying my workouts again. I honestly couldn’t believe that something so simple could make such a big difference so quickly.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many health supplements out there, but MITOLYN really does a few things differently:

✅ **Only the Good Stuff**  
MITOLYN only uses quality ingredients—no weird fillers or fake flavors. I could tell it was made with care, and I felt safe taking it every day.

✅ **Visible, Real Results**  
This wasn’t just a “maybe I feel better” kind of thing. I felt stronger, more focused, and just happier overall. My friends and family even started to notice!

✅ **Safe and Gentle**  
I didn’t have any bad reactions or upset stomach, which has happened to me with other supplements before. MITOLYN felt gentle, but powerful.

✅ **Worth the Money**  
I know there are cheaper options, but MITOLYN actually works. I stopped wasting money on all those other things that never made a difference.

✅ **Loved by Real People**  
It’s not just me—there are thousands of people online sharing their MITOLYN stories. That made me feel confident I’d made the right choice.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest parts of my MITOLYN journey was how quickly people around me started to see the change. My coworkers asked if I’d changed my routine because I seemed more energetic and positive. My friends commented that I looked healthier and more “present.” Even my family noticed I was less grumpy and more fun to be around!

When I told them about MITOLYN, a few of them decided to give it a try, and they had great results too. It felt good to share something that actually worked instead of just another fad.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had one small issue with my order (the shipping took a bit longer than expected because of a holiday), so I reached out to MITOLYN’s customer support. They replied quickly and were super friendly. They even checked in a week later to make sure everything had arrived and that I was happy with my purchase.

It’s rare to find a company that treats you like a real person, not just a number. MITOLYN’s team really made me feel valued and supported throughout my whole experience.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Without a doubt, yes! I’ve already told my closest friends and family, and I’m telling you now: MITOLYN is worth trying if you’re tired of feeling tired, unfocused, or just not like yourself. It’s made a huge difference in my life, and I honestly wish I’d found it sooner.

If you’re wondering if it’s right for you, I’d say go for it. You won’t know until you try, and you might be surprised at just how much better you can feel.

MITOLYN isn’t just another supplement sitting on my shelf. It’s become a part of my daily life, and I’ve never felt better. My energy is up, my mind is clearer, and I’m enjoying life so much more.

I wasted so much time and money on things that never worked, but MITOLYN delivered real results. If you’re ready to invest in yourself and see what you’re truly capable of, I can’t recommend it enough.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

For as long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with feeling tired all the time. No matter how much I slept, I’d wake up groggy and stay sluggish all day. My brain felt foggy, and I’d lose focus so easily—even on things I enjoyed! I also noticed I was gaining weight, my motivation was slipping, and my mood was all over the place.

I tried everything I could think of: drinking more water, getting more exercise, even following advice from popular health gurus online. I bought fancy vitamins and tried weird diets, but nothing really helped for long. It felt like my body just wasn’t working right, and I was getting more frustrated every day.

That’s when I stumbled across MITOLYN. I saw so many people raving about it online, and I thought, “Maybe this is finally something that will help.”

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was actually impressed right away. The box looked really nice and modern—not flimsy or cheap. The instructions were super clear, and it was easy to see how much to take and when. There was even a little card inside with tips and encouragement, which made me feel like the company really cared about my results.

I was also happy to see that the ingredients list was simple and didn’t have anything weird or artificial. I’ve tried products before that were packed with stuff I couldn’t pronounce, but MITOLYN’s formula looked clean and trustworthy.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I didn’t expect to feel different right away. Most supplements take weeks or months to show any effect, and I was ready to be patient. But, to my surprise, I started to notice little changes just a few days after starting MITOLYN.

First, I had more energy in the morning. I didn’t feel like I was dragging myself out of bed. My brain felt less foggy—I could focus better at work and even remember little things like where I left my keys! By the end of the first week, I realized I wasn’t reaching for coffee every couple of hours. My energy lasted longer and felt much more natural.

As the days went by, my mood improved, too. I felt less stressed and more upbeat. My cravings for junk food went down, and I even started enjoying my workouts again. I honestly couldn’t believe that something so simple could make such a big difference so quickly.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many health supplements out there, but MITOLYN really does a few things differently:

✅ **Only the Good Stuff**  
MITOLYN only uses quality ingredients—no weird fillers or fake flavors. I could tell it was made with care, and I felt safe taking it every day.

✅ **Visible, Real Results**  
This wasn’t just a “maybe I feel better” kind of thing. I felt stronger, more focused, and just happier overall. My friends and family even started to notice!

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.



My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.



I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

Prime Biome has received a mix of reviews from users worldwide. Many customers have reported positive experiences, particularly regarding skin improvements and digestive health.

For instance, Sarah from New York shared, “I would have never, ever dreamed that my skin could look so amazing. If you had told me two months ago that my dark spots and fine wrinkles would disappear with such a simple solution, I would have laughed in your face. I am so happy I gave this a try!” 

Similarly, Alexa from Wyoming mentioned, “I used to need so much Botox to keep the wrinkles away that my face was permanently frozen. And it did nothing for the saggy skin on my chin and my turkey neck. A few weeks into using this PrimeBiome supplement and I am speechless! I wake up, I look in the mirror and I love what I see.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

Day  2 8am post op:  Slept until 8 am which was a pleasant surprise as Ive been stuck In a consistent Internal alarm clock of 3:30 making it nearly impossible to fall back asleep, sleeping to 8am hasn’t happened for me in over a year.  Stomach is sore the only way I can describe it is if one was to join a sit up contest and do max reps with 0 training prior.  Like your legs feel after going to Disneyland without working up to the  activity.  Not worse than a normal day after activity over the last year just sore.  The gas bubble under the muscle is all but gone still a little bloat, but no where near yesterday.  Sleeping In the fetal postion hugging a pillow with one between my legs felt the most comfortable.

9pm update: Feeling good, was able to go on a long walk with wiefy, Stomach distension Is subsiding,  curious to find out what new normal will feel like In a couples weeks.  Haven’t felt normal In over a year and It was getting exhausting.

5pm update:  So far so good!  Biggest issue so far is the gas bubbles In stomach and under the skin  🫧 feels like the definition of subcutaneous emphysema (neck rice crispies) where I can feel gas migrating up my chest into my neck exactly what we were told to look for in diving related injuries.  Holding off on the pain killers as I currently feel less pain than the average day of the last year.  Can’t even describe it as pain more of a discomfort. I think I can manage with out the narcotics and stick to the musle relaxers to settle the supporting muscles.  

Got home around 11:00am today after getting some mesh installed for three hernias.  Hoping this finally puts an end to the constant pain and aching I’ve been dealing with for the past year.

The whole process was weirdly smooth. It felt like I was the car in a NASCAR pit crew scene with everyone doing their part in perfect sync. I don’t even remember falling asleep… just waking up and immediately asking for coffee like a true professional ☕️

Pain is minimal so far. Honestly not much worse than what I’ve already been living with. My stomach is currently full of CO₂ gas so I look like I just destroyed Christmas dinner🥴 Discomfort is surprisingly low… though that might be the narcotic cocktail currently flowing through my system 💊

Huge shoutout to my amazing mother-in-law for being by my side the whole time. 10/10 bedside manner, talk about winning the In-law Lottery!!! 🏆🥇

And Dr.  crushed it. He came highly recommended by trusted friends, the VA, and basically every doctor rating site out there. Definitely lived up to the hype ****

Fingers crossed this is the fix I’ve needed **** I don’t even like shirts with itchy tags so having my guts feel like they’re tearing? Yeah… I’m beyond ready to move on ****

Hardest part of the whole thing?
Not drinking water after midnight and skipping morning coffee ☕️🚫 and still managing to act like a decent human being. That was the real surgery ****

Thanks for all the love and support! We’ll see how tomorrow goes.

P.S.  Apparently the slit goes in the back. So does my last shred of dignity.

1ks3b9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Acrobatic-Pin2985/comments/1ks3b9n/damn_math_teachers/,Damn math teachers,"Thanks to the IB math teachers for absolutely nothing. 

You all are like magicians, but instead of pulling out rabbits from a hat, you pull out equations and magically expect us to know them. Spoiler alert! We don't! Even after proudly not teaching, you dare to surprise us with a standardized test just because some parents asked you to, whose children already have tutors. Suddenly, it's a crisis. Like it's dependent on your life to listen to them and give us the same test. God forbid I work my ass off and pull a hell of a test straight from the satan's ass and give it to us. 

Don't forget about the time you left us with a substitute who didn't even know which wall the whiteboard faced, who thought BODMAS was a new K-pop group, who couldn't even do the standard exercises, let alone the harder ones. You come and leave like you don't have a paying job to do here. 

The way you smile at us and make us feel dumb is insane to me. Math is not something that can be divided into ""levels."" It's about solving equations and learning more, and slowly reaching a higher level, not being divided into different levels, and being hit with a standard level if you're stupid or ""don't have a higher level,"" in your words, or feeling the need to drain yourself and do the higher grades. You don't teach for either though. 

Even when you four teachers see the students struggling, they come up with their damn excuse of ""maybe this isn't your level."" Oh fuck me in the arse with a chainsaw. God forbid I study myself all night just for some students with tutors to defend the teacher or get a failing grade. 

It must be nice for you to sit on your table and drink your coffee while everyone blinks and stares at their damn books because you magically decided that we knew everything even though we are just teenagers, sleep deprived too.

1. Elena would not get with either of the salvatore brothers. That is the ending I would give. No stelena or delena. Because the salvatore brothers are in a toxic cycle perpetuated by the petrova doppelgängers. Ultimately the show is about the brothers, not elena. 
I would make it as Elena being unable to choose a salvatore and the brothers choose each other over elena. She ends up being a novelist( s1 elena’s preference) and writes romance books based on the salvatore brothers. She happily marries an unnamed human and has children.

2. Damon would end up with Bonnie. After the brothers choose each other they both move away from mystic falls and swear to never return (since the problems started with their return). But damon breaks his vow and returns to mystic falls on the anniversary of the sherrifs death and he meets bonnie who has grown into herself. They have coffee and their begins a cute little romance. They travel the world together and adopt a daughter.

3. Stefan would move to Europe where he trains to be a paramedic (toms arc). He is able to control his blood lust and is thriving away from elena and his brother. He has a lot of romances and he just lives his life to the fullest, guilt free. He has so much fun everyday and embraces being a vampire.

4. Caroline would move to new orleans for a fresh start. There she meets klaus again and they fall in love all over again. She goes with klaus to paris when he has the hollow inside of him. She accompanies him everywhere while having a thriving online blog. They have fun together and they eventually tie the knot. She convinces klaus to not kill himself. The hollow is defeated some other way and all of them live happily ever after.

5. Bonnie becomes a wellness guru. She runs an apothecary in mystic falls with all sorts of herbs and potions. She is happy with her small town life until she meets damon. That is when she craves for a bigger life and runs away from mystic falls with him.

They all meet at elenas suprise birthday party for which elenas husband invited her childhoof friends over. They all have fun and reminisce and are fullfilled with their lives. Elena then realises  that she is happy she chose neither of the salvatores because she will always love them both( in a cute way not a cheaty way). The screen blacks out.

# Basic Rules

* **Goal**: Clear all cards from the board without filling your bottom bar
* **Board**: Contains stacked cards with various template icons (fan, fox, coffee, etc.)
* **Hidden Cards**: Dimmed cards are locked underneath visible ones (most of them is partially visible)

# How to Play

1. **Select Cards**: Click any available card to move it to your bottom bar
2. **Match Three**: When you collect 3 identical icons, they automatically disappear
3. **Bottom Bar Limit**: You only have 7 slots in the bottom bar
4. **Lose Condition**: If your bottom bar fills completely (7 cards with no matches), you lose
5. **Win Condition**: Successfully remove all cards from the board

# Strategy Elements

* Plan ahead to create matches before your bottom bar fills up
* Prioritize collecting cards that already have matches in your bottom bar
* Consider which cards will become available after removing top cards
* Balance between immediate matches and setting up future combinations",1,1747847417.0,AI_Agents,2,1.0,False

1ks38t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FindYourTrip/comments/1ks38t0/elegant_travel_tips_for_introverts/,Elegant Travel Tips For Introverts,"**Elegant Travel Tips For Introverts**

For introverts, traveling can be both exhilarating and draining. However, embracing travel with elegance means finding ways to balance social encounters with personal downtime. Here are some elegant travel tips tailored specifically for introverts.

Choosing the right destination is crucial. Opt for serene locations over bustling tourist spots. Places like quaint towns, nature retreats, or tranquil beaches provide a soothing environment, allowing for moments of solitude amidst exploration. Prioritize destinations that offer a blend of cultural experiences and peaceful settings.

Pacing is key to maintaining comfort while traveling. Schedule plenty of downtime between activities. Consider creating a flexible itinerary that allows for spontaneous breaks to recharge. For instance, after a museum visit, set aside an hour to enjoy a coffee at a quiet café instead of immediately heading to the next location.

Accommodations can also greatly influence an introvert’s experience. Seek lodgings that emphasize privacy and comfort, such as boutique hotels or vacation rentals. Look for places with cozy reading nooks or serene outdoor spaces where you can unwind after a day of exploration.

When it comes to social interactions, embrace small group settings. Instead of large tours, opt for private guides or small group excursions. This creates closer connections with fewer people, allowing for deeper conversations without overwhelming social dynamics.


Pack smartly: Bring a book or journal to enjoy personal time during travel.
Use technology: Apps can help streamline travel logistics, giving you more time to relax.
Explore solo: Embrace activities like hiking or visiting museums alone, which can be rejuvenating.
Plan a retreat day: Set aside a day for self-care, whether through spa treatments or a day spent in nature.


Ultimately, elegant travel for introverts means prioritizing personal space, well-being, and the type of experiences that resonate most deeply. With thoughtful planning, travel can transcend social expectations and become a truly enriching endeavor.

I am a 18 F. My best friend is 20 F and my another friend is 19 F. The guy is 21M. My parents are strict but I still sneak off to meet my friends (only during daytime tho) 
 About a year ago I met a guy who used to be my best friend's bf's friend. He wanted to meet me but I refused since I was not interested but he persisted and I agreed. We met at a cafe for like 15 minutes before I had to leave to attend class and then we never talked again but last week I got his text. We chatted a bit for 2 days then one night we played truth and dare (classic teenage behaviour, I know) but things became weird when he asked me about my preferred length of d*ck. I was feeling uncomfortable yet I ignored it thinking  'teenage is weird ig'(I know it was dumb) After a week we decided to meet, my friend tagged along me but due to a sudden incident she had to leave me and the guy alone in car. I asked him to drive to a nearby cafe but he suggested driving a bit and then getting some coffee I reluctantly agreed. After a bit he drove to a secluded area, I know I should have left the car at that point but try and understand me, he was 6ft somethin' and on the muscular side. After stopping in a deserted parking our conversation went like this 
'So a kiss?'
'Umm, what?'
'One kiss pls'
'No *nervous laughing* I feel uncomfortable. Maybe sometime else?'
'Please sweetheart just one'
'No means no. You told me you won't do anything if I feel uncomfortable'
Then he just sighed like I did something wrong and then out of nowhere hugged me. I felt so awful. I felt like crying but I knew that if I resisted he could force me into doing something else too so I just froze there for a moment. His hands roamed all over my back and 'accidentally' cupped my b*obs. I felt lile dying but fortunately he let me go and drove to a place I was familiar with. I told him I had to leave but he held my hand and said 'no, wait for a while' I tried to get off but he didn't let me so I sat there.
When I told him that I can't do this, I can't date him, he acted like I kicked his puppy. His hand carresed my jaw and then went to my collarbone to my lips 😭 I tried to get his hand off and leave but the door was locked. I had to soothe his ego a bit so that he doesn't harm me but luckily my friend called just like I had asked her to, in 30 minutes of her leaving. Her number is saved as 'Lil Kiddo' so the guy thought it was my lil sister, I made a quick excuse of family emergency and tried to leave but he insisted on dropping me off but I made an excuse of my father picking me up so I finally left his car and stood by the pavement while he was still there, watching me like a hawk. I texted my friend about picking me up and in 5 minutes her father came to pick me up(her family is like the family I never had. Her parents love me a lot. I am so thankful for them tbh)

Its minimalist yet functional appearance really elevates the look of my kitchen. Even with its compact dimensions (9.5""D x 6""W x 7""H), it manages to stand out on my countertop without taking up unnecessary space. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been giving this toaster a thorough workout, and while it delivers on most promises, there are a few quirks worth pointing out.

**Design and Materials**  
The aesthetic of this toaster is simply excellent. Crafted from stainless steel, the black and metallic finish offers that elusive mix of modernity and durability. What sold me right away was the slim profile. I live in an apartment where counter space is basically nonexistent, but this toaster fits perfectly alongside my coffee maker without crowding the area. The design feels solid, and the weight at 3.5 pounds reassures that it isn’t flimsy. Even the buttons have a nice tactile feel when pressed, which is not something I’ve always found in similar appliances.  

[Find the best price for Peach Street PE-1602 on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b0b492hmg6/)  

**Customizable Toast Settings**  
What really surprised me was the variety of toasting options. It comes with six browning levels, and trust me, I’ve tried every single one of them. Whether it’s crisp toast for my tea or a lightly browned slice for scrambled eggs, the customization is spot on. I also tested the DEFROST and BAGEL features. The BAGEL function is my personal favorite—it toasts only the cut side, leaving the outer layer warm but soft. I even experimented with toasting thicker bread like Texas toast and some artisanal sourdough slices, and they fit surprisingly well in the wide slots with no hassle. I can finally stop cramming bread into a toaster it clearly doesn't fit in. 

**Performance and Countdown Display**  
One standout feature is the LCD display. The digital countdown timer is fantastic because I’m the type of person who walks away from my toaster to make coffee and forgets about it. Knowing exactly how long I have left is a game-changer. This convenience really elevates the experience—you can multitask without worrying about cold toast waiting for you. Its performance is surprisingly efficient for an 800-watt appliance. I noticed that it heats up evenly, which means no awkward cold patches in your toast (I’ve been burned by that—pun intended—with other toasters in the past).

**Tidy and Smart Features**  
Crumbs, crumbs, and more crumbs. Toasting tends to leave a mess for sure, but the removable crumb tray on this product really helps keep things tidy. It slides in and out seamlessly, and now I don’t have to flip my toaster upside down to clean it. Another feature I appreciated is the storage for the cord. There's a discreet slot to keep the cord tucked away. Little details like these make it such a thoughtful addition to my kitchen.  

**Strengths**  
- Wide slots accommodate thick bread, bagels, and more  
- Handy LCD countdown timer  
- Superior browning customization with 6 levels  
- Compact and lightweight yet sturdy stainless-steel design  

**Weaknesses**  
- Toasting can sometimes be uneven with higher browning levels  
- The stainless-steel exterior smudges easily and requires frequent cleaning  
- The cord length might be short for kitchens with limited power outlets  

**Product Comparisons**  
Having previously owned a Cuisinart CPT-180 and tested a Breville BTA720XL, I can confidently say this toaster holds its ground. While the Cuisinart is slightly bulkier, it does offer dual controls for four slices, which may suit larger households. Meanwhile, the Breville edges this one out slightly in toasting consistency but comes at a much higher price point. The Peach Street’s DEFROST and BAGEL features performed better than the Breville, especially for versatility. Additionally, the cord storage and slim profile make it a better option for smaller kitchens compared to the Cuisinart.  

**Worth Every Penny?**  
If you're looking for a product that balances design, functionality, and affordability, this toaster strikes a sweet spot. It may not have premium features like a touchscreen or four-slice capacity found in high-end models, but its DEFROST, six browning levels, and countdown timer make it a joy to use daily. The price is reasonable compared to other similar toasters, and for the features it offers, it's definitely worth considering.

I am going on a sabbatical and looking to sublet my 2 bedroom apartment starting June 12. Ideally I'd like to find someone who would be interested in a 3+ month stay, and would like a space that they can treat as their home for that time.

It is a sunny corner-unit two bedroom in the heart of Bushwick— 5 minutes away from the L train, and in the middle of all the coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and nightlife.

  
Rent is $875/week ($3500/month), but I'd discount it for a longer stay with the right person. Couples, friends, or solo people are all fine-- but good vibes and trust are important.

📍Location  
1 block away from House of Yes  
2 blocks away from Maria Hernandez Park  
2 blocks away from Hana Natural Foods or City Fresh Market

🪐 The Space  
Hardwood floors and original window trim throughout, designed lighting and a new luxury-firm mattress.

The space will be furnished. The primary bedroom has a queen-sized bed, and the second one (almost as big) is currently outfitted to be an office / yoga studio, but can easily fit a twin or queen-sized bed (not included). It's a corner unit with views of the city and incredible light.

The kitchen is well-equipped because I do plenty of cooking!

The living room is the central hub of the unit, and features a TV, sofa, coffee table, and dining table.

I have two window A/C units that can be paired to your phone so that you can turn it on/off remotely. You can also use the Google Nest speaker to turn the ambient lighting in the living room or bedroom on/off, or to play music.

Bonus: I have a red-light therapy panel in the bathroom, and yoga mats, blocks, weights and other fitness gear in the 2nd bedroom.

I’ll clear out a closet and some drawers for your usage, but some storage will not be available.

  
⚠️ Important ⚠️

Wifi and streaming is included, but utilities are not included and will be pro-rated based on your dates. Usually during the summer months, gas is \~$50 USD and electricity is \~150-200 per month, depending on A/C usage. Receipts will be provided. ",1,1747846927.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False

I would say he's doing somebody's adderall, I would say he might be drinking tons of coffee, but I don't get the opiate vibe off him based on his voice. Opiate voice gets really gravely. Opiate personality is sometimes horny and annoyed, he doesn't have the posture I have seen with opiates, either. Now stimulants, I can see him on stimulants. But also, it's possible that his eyes just look like that because he's got the round 'influencer' light on him.( I'm sure there's another name for it.)

She’s currently searching for roles in healthcare compliance, medical records, medical collections, and other positions related to her degree.

Over the past 3–4 weeks, she’s applied to around 100 jobs but has only received two interviews so far. I asked if she’s been tailoring her resume to include keywords from each job description, and she said she hasn’t been doing that, which I suspect might be a big reason for the lack of responses.

I’ve included two screenshots:

The first is the original resume we created (which got her the two interviews). The second is the updated version we just worked on yesterday.

**May 8–15, 2025**

# Montclair Mood This Week

The warmth held steady this week, like a sunbeam stretched across Watchung Plaza. Tulips lingered, schoolyards buzzed with the giddy hum of nearly-summer kids, and on porches and stoops, neighbors waved like old friends, even when they weren’t. Mother’s Day flowers wilted gently in vases, but their spirit—tender, reflective, alive—stayed in the air.

This week, Montclair felt like a town **in rhythm with itself**. Not rushing. Not lagging. Just moving forward in step with the season. Sidewalks were busier, yes—but not frantic. Restaurants filled, but not overwhelmed. Even town meetings, often tense, took on a more thoughtful, almost graceful, pace.

The economy felt like the **pocket of a favorite spring jacket—worn in, useful, and quietly full of good things**.

# Acorn Index Update

Montclair’s **Acorn Index rose to $1.13**, a slight but steady climb from last week’s $1.11 (\~+1.8%). It’s the kind of movement that suggests **confidence not from headlines, but from habits**. Locals kept spending—just a little—on flowers, coffee, takeout dinners, and those small things that whisper, *“I’m okay right now.”*

The uptick continues a gentle, month-long trend upward. Montclair isn’t booming, but it’s **growing with grace**, like ivy along the garden fence. The town’s micro-economy reflects a mood of **cautious optimism**, supported by strong foot traffic, warm weather, and a community that—quietly, daily—chooses local.

# Acorn ETF Sector Roundup

**🌱 ACH (Healthy Growth):**  
Fitness classes spilled into parks this week, and dog-walkers packed Anderson Park like clockwork. The local Bike Bus expanded routes, celebrating safe streets and green commuting. Montclair’s community health efforts showed continuity—no new crises, just quiet consistency. That’s growth of the best kind.

**🏪 ACB (Acorn Biz Fund):**  
The business sector blossomed with modest gains. A new flower shop opened near Upper Montclair, offering custom spring bouquets and Sunday sidewalk jazz. Meanwhile, Montclair’s stationery hub Parcel launched its first ""Curated Week"" at the Park Street showroom, drawing families and paper lovers with its nostalgic charm. Even as a few businesses in nearby towns quietly closed, Montclair’s ACB sector held firm—**not with flash, but with familiarity and flair.**

**🎨 ACT (Creative Sparks):**  
Excitement grew for Montclair Porchfest, set for May 17th. Lawn signs popped up like crocuses, and local bands began rehearsing on stoops. The Montclair Film team continued prep for their upcoming screenings, while the Montclair Art Museum quietly introduced new visiting exhibits. Residents reported a sense of \*“cultural alignment”—\*the feeling that art here doesn’t interrupt life, but enhances it.

**🏛️ ACE (Civic Essentials):**  
The Township Council pushed forward with library renovations, approving early contractor reviews and setting design feedback dates for summer. Meanwhile, Planning Board follow-up on affordable housing obligations continued. Community voices grew louder—not in protest, but in *persistence*. The civic sector showed steady motion, even as the deeper issues of equity and infrastructure remained under deliberation.

**🥐 NUT (Neighborhood Eats & Treats):**  
Outdoor dining expanded this week, especially near Church Street and Bloomfield Ave. Mother’s Day brunches filled up fast, and some cafés extended hours due to increased demand. Meanwhile, local markets reported mild supply shortages in fresh herbs and specialty cheeses, suggesting a spike in home cooking. All told, NUT delivered a flavorful week—even if dessert menus ran out of tiramisu by 8 PM.

**🏡 LUX (Plenty & Property):**  
Open house signs dotted the town again as the **spring real estate rush continued.** Homes in the $850K–$1.2M range moved quickly, and bidding wars resumed in the estate zones near Watchung and South End. Boutique retailers continued to lean into hybrid models—offering curbside pickup, espresso bars, and private appointments. Montclair’s upper-tier economy remained strong—if selectively accessible.

**🌳 GRR (Green & Resilient Returns):**  
Rainy spells early in the week fed local gardens, and compost bins saw heavier use thanks to a spring clean-out campaign hosted by Montclair Climate Action. A community forum on stormwater management drew strong turnout, as residents continue to wrestle with long-term sustainability. The GRR sector held steady—like a rain barrel filling slowly, preparing for the dry days ahead.

**🐿️ SQRL (Montclair Momentum):**  
There was movement, there was music, and there was meaning. This week’s vibe was **""balanced buzz""**—a calm confidence powered by community events, local pride, and the slow build toward summer. Families, freelancers, and folks on foot all contributed to a sense that Montclair, in this moment, *knows who it is*.

# Golden Acorn Award

**Awarded to: The Montclair Bike Bus Team**

In a week where safety and joy rode side-by-side, the Montclair Bike Bus expanded its reach—adding more students, more parents, and more visibility to its growing movement. This volunteer-led initiative has turned Friday mornings into scenes of delight: **children in helmets, laughter in motion, and civic courage on wheels.**

By modeling eco-friendly transport and advocating for safer routes, they’re not just pedaling bikes—they’re pedaling change. For bringing new energy, safety, and sunshine to our sidewalks, we award them the Golden Acorn.

# Rotten Acorn Alert

**Affordable Housing Drift Continues**

Despite last week’s hearing and public input, little tangible movement has been made to address Montclair’s housing affordability gap. The same questions linger—*how soon, how many, how fair*—with few answers. As rents climb and middle-income residents feel the squeeze, the **urgency is real**, but the execution still lags.

This acorn may not be rotten from neglect—but it’s on the edge. Without rapid planting of policies and real action, Montclair risks watching its inclusive roots wither.

# Nut Notes: Echoes from the Outside World

National news this week echoed Montclair’s mood: **gentle economic confidence**, but with eyes wide open. U.S. inflation held near 2.3%, mortgage rates inched downward, and the Fed hinted at a rate pause heading into June. Montclair’s own Acorn Index mirrored that sentiment—not booming, but blossoming.

Meanwhile, student loan repayment discussions and state-level housing bills made headlines—issues that touch many Montclair households. Small business optimism rose nationally, and locally, that showed up in reopened boutiques, reinvested shopfronts, and the soft clink of mugs in morning cafés.

Montclair may be small, but it reflects the world in its windows. And as spring nears its peak, **our little acorn town feels firmly planted.**

The Marine Park Young Adults Association is a community-driven social group for young adults ages 18–35 in southern Brooklyn that has registered as a nonprofit with the State and will soon be filing as a 501(c)(7) non-charitable nonprofit. Our mission is to create spaces where young people can make meaningful connections through fun events, creative activities, and impactful community service projects. From movie nights and murder mystery parties to concerts and volunteer work, we’re all about bringing people together and giving back.

Climate Cafe South Brooklyn builds on that mission—offering a relaxed, welcoming space for everyone, regardless of age, to come together and talk about climate change in a supportive, non-judgmental environment. It’s not a lecture or a seminar—it’s a conversation. Whether you’re feeling anxious, inspired, confused, or just curious, you’re welcome.

1ks2onc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LastTrainHome/comments/1ks2onc/vladivostok_day_6_0844/,"Vladivostok: Day 6, 08:44","Many thanks to u/elglin1982 for challenging me to beat his record of Day 6, 19:03. I would have never done it if no one challenged me. We also had couple valuable discussions about the strategy and how to further streamline the speedruns. 

This speedrun was a mess. I had to modify several things from my ""casual"" 10-day speedrun guide to fit this ""extreme"" under-7-days speedrun. For example:

* Ramming blockades sooner has serious ramifications (haha, get it?). First, it means less opportunity to repair/upgrade train. I could not get all the tier 2 upgrades like comfortable living or insulation, so soldiers were pretty miserable most of the time. Second, it meant I did not get enough resources from PoI, mainly herbs, so I could not cook soup that much.
* Lack of herbs meant constant food shortages and a necessity to keep the kitchen car intact (not used for ramming) for the whole journey. It served as an occasional soup maker whenever I happened to get 20 herbs. 
* Going full-speed much sooner (after Petropavlovsk) and means burning wood and even cloth (blueberries were already eaten by the crew as described above).
* So how did I ram blockades, if I could not use the kitchen car? Infantry car #3. I only kept a roster of 24 soldiers in the first two cars and the third car was immediately put in front of the locomotive and served as a ramming device. 
* The above had an unpleasant consequence, though - despite the car having zero health and a destroyed status, the game still thinks I have 6 soldier slots available. So whenever I gained new soldiers they were automatically put into that destroyed car only to be ""killed"" almost instantly (shortly after the game is unpaused). If I wanted to save a new soldier I had to swap him immediately with someone from car 1 or 2, and that someone would be killed instead, great.
* Due to this, I had a lot of killed soldier drama - morale dropped dangerously low for all the remaining 24 soldiers. I had to serve so many vigils (to offset the morale loss) that everyone could recite those when woken up at midnight, verbatim. I had to use A LOT of consumables (to boost morale and stamina).
* My train only had the three infantry cars (one used as ram), storage, and kitchen. I did not get Zaamurets to save time, and I never purchased artillery car as I never had enough money to afford it. All my money was spent on consumables, good guns, and stuff that can burn.
* Coffee is important. With the limited amount of time for repairs/upgrades at the few blockades I did stop at, I had to accomplish as many repairs/upgrades as possible. Not having an artillery car hurt here as most of my workers were only lvl2 or 3, so their productivity was not very high. Coffee essentially substituted for worker training in artillery car by boosting everyone's productivity by 20% and ensuring shit was done. Thank you, coffee!

It's crazy how all these seemingly little things (like ramming a few extra blockades or using a different car for ramming) snowballed from an easy run where you're just meticulous about saving time (or so I thought) into this clusterfuck of soldiers being hungry/cold/tired/low morale and the train always being half-broken and low on fuel.

I made several mistakes which amounted to about 4 hours of lost time, so it is very viable to achieve a better time! 

However, I do not see a pathway where you could shave off 9 hours and arrive on Day 5, so unless I'm wrong Day 5 is not accessible - with the caveat that you play on max difficulty where fuel consumption and train deterioration happens faster. If you play on normal diffuculty perhpas Day 5 is achievable...",3,1747846050.0,LastTrainHome,2,1.0,False

I just completed my first Skyrizi OBI and my symptoms are mostly gone, except every few days I get diarrhea and I get super depressed.

My wife started noticing a pattern where everytime I have diarrhea I immediately start blaming certain foods or drinks and then even when I cut them out I still get symptoms, so it’s a cycle of stress.

I’ve been told on here that foods don’t really affect the disease activity, just the symptoms…which I don’t know how to feel. I have to drink tea and coffee daily just to keep awake for my family, but I also blame tea and coffee for my flares.

I’m at a loss for what to do or feel. I can’t live with this crippling fatigue or stress, and Skyrizi seems to take forever to work.

Any advise or guidance would be great!

1ks2jfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ks2jfr/grinder_advice_please_500/,Grinder advice please [£500],"Hello,

I’m thinking about investing a little to improve my coffee setup at home. I tend to brew pour-over in the morning and espresso in the afternoon. For the former, I have a Wilfa Uniform, and for espresso (using an old Rancilo Silvia) I have a Rancilio Rocky grinder. Both these are about 15 years old now. I’m wondering whether the time has come to replace the Rocky, which seems to perform reasonably well, but can’t really cope with single origin beans - whenever I try to grind these (usually lighter roasts than espresso blends) the shots are thin and run very fast. I have to consistently grind at zero or close to zero whatever beans I use on it. There’s no real dialling in, because I can’t go any finer without the burrs clashing.

I’m happy with my pour-over setup, the Uniform performs well through V60. My question is, should I try overhauling the Rocky (new burrs? Strip-down and clean?), or is it time to look at something new? I’ve seen the Niche Zero and DF64 Gen2, and my budget will stretch to both if I decide to go down that route. For espresso I tend to grind individual shots, and make two or three in succession (for the family). On the other hand, the chrome is peeling from the Silvia, and there’s corrosion spreading along the drip tray.

My instinct is that spending money on a new grinder at this point would improve my espresso shots, but that I might need to look at a new espresso machine in a couple of years.

If I replace my Rocky, I would have a budget of about £500. Would be grateful for any advice you can offer. Thanks!",1,1747845703.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1ks2je2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1ks2je2/discarded_after_6_months_and_feeling_shattered/,"Discarded after 6 months, and feeling shattered","I want to start this off by saying I'm not really sure she has BPD, but I've had a couple different people mention to me that that's what it sounded like to them when I recounted our somewhat brief relationship. I've heard of it in the past and even read about it and watched some content, but for whatever reason I didn't really ever think about it in my relationship with her. For context, I'm 37 and she's 32.

We met on a dating app. She had an infectious positivity about her. We made out on our first date, and then hooked up in the middle of our second (she asked me to get something from the car and then made a move on me). From that point on, we moved very fast. On the third date, she told me that she was still friends with her ex, that they met about once a week and up until her and I met, they were sleeping together semi-regularly. She said it was 100% platonic and that she actually never really had much emotional attraction to him. He was a safe person for her and she ended up finally leaving when she realized she needed real romance and to really desire her partner. She felt bad about it but considered him a really close friend, and claimed that he was 100% in agreement that they were just friends and there was no future for them. This definitely raised my eyebrows - I assumed the guy was just maybe still in love with her and taking what he could get, and that she was naive for thinking the situation was ok for them. This arrangement had been going on for about a year.

I was actually talking to a couple other people at the time and thought that maybe I should take this as a sign to focus on them, but there was something about her that was so alluring. She was attractive, and the sex was pretty wild, but more than that I felt such a strong emotional connection. She ended up going back to her hometown for a couple weeks after our 3rd or 4th date, and I kind of assumed it might fizzle out, but she stayed in touch constantly. We'd send each other voice notes, she'd send nudes, we'd have hours long conversations. I was really starting to fall for her.

When she came back, we were inseparable. We decided to be exclusive. We started hanging out every single day. It was magical. Holiday markets. Short overnight trips. There were no boring moments. She seemed so interested in everything I loved, and she pulled me into her world too. She also seemed extremely dedicated to developing herself. She made a huge career change and was trying to start her own business. She had seemingly very strong ethics about how she interacted with the world. I later came to realize that she basically changed her entire life every few years, but that's another story. We were less than 2 months in but it felt like we were in love.

I learned about her incredibly abusive and chaotic upbringing. She was in fact still in touch with a family member that had abused her and her sister, and I always thought that was very bizarre. Her mother is also in a cult.

at around the 2 month mark, she asks me to be her boyfriend. Then not too long after that she says she loves me. I start to get a sense of some internal struggle at this point though. She starts saying things like she wanted to say that for a while, but she's not sure if she's ever really loved anyone. Sometimes she talks about having my babies and then sometimes she says she's not sure she can ever get married.

The next couple months are kind of a blur. We're still spending most of our time together. Still having a lot of sex. But there are some tense conversations around random things. We plan a trip to visit my family for a week though. It seems to go amazingly. My family loves her. We have a magical time visiting a big city together. There are a couple of weird moments where she seems to shut down a bit but then she's back to her normal self. After we get back from the trip, she writes an article on her substack about how in love with me she is, how magical the trip was, how everything was so perfect. We start talking about getting more serious. Ask each other things about marriage, children, houses, etc.

Little did I know, but this is when she starts reconnecting with people from her past, people she slept with or dated. A few weeks go by and she's starting little fights over tiny things. My anxiety starts rising. I realized she met with her ex bf to give him something without telling me, which was really weird. We told each other everything we were doing day to day. I brought this up in a small argument we were having, and she claims it meant nothing, they just got coffee. And the next day she sits me down with an extremely serious tone and says that bringing that up in a conversation about something else was out of bounds, and if i ever brought that up, or took out my jealousy issues on her again, that we would be over (I told her I got cheated on in my last relationship). I don't drop the argument, I start asking her more questions about it, and she reveals she's been talking to at least 3 other guys (on top of her ex) that she previously had some kind of romantic involvement with. One of them was a situationship that ended shortly before we dated (seemingly she wanted more, and he didn't). She said they ""only"" slept together 10-15 times and were just friends. She admits that he sent her a meme and then she asked him if he wanted to talk on the phone, and they talked for a few hours on a day she cancelled plans with me.

I don't know what happened, but next thing I know we are hooking up, telling each other we're sorry about everything, and we're gonna get back on track. She's going to block all these guys and focus on us. The next morning, I wake up and tell her I'm still not sure about things. I go to the bathroom and when I come back, she has her phone out and says I can read her messages, and if I want to end things, she understands. I read all of her messages with this guy. She completely underplayed how much they were messaging. Yes, he sent a meme a couple weeks earlier, but since then, they had been texting constantly. He even invited her to go on a trip out of state with her, which she thumbs up, but didn't respond otherwise. It was the last message, so she could have easily deleted that. I tell her that everything is fucked, I don't know if I can go on. She leaves, we don't talk all day, and then she sends me a long ass voice message about how shattered she is, she is an awful person. She's so sorry. She got scared that we were so serious, and all the little fights we had were here fault. She even projected jealousy onto me in the weeks leading up to this, accusing me of still being in touch with my ex which was 100% not true.

She wrote me a letter. In it she called it emotional infidelity. She said she did the same thing in her last relationship. Whenever she became unsure, she would start involving someone else. But she vowed that she was changing, she was going to close all the doors to her past and wanted to focus on me, focus on us. We already had another trip booked for the end of the month (April), and I confided all of this with one friend. He said it didn't look good, but I should just go on the trip anyway and feel it out. The next few weeks prior to the trip, she goes out of her way to be extremely loving. She apologizes constantly. She tells me all the time she wants my kids, she wants a life with me. She even made AI pictures of babies using pictures of us. Eventually, I stupidly let my guard fall. I don't know how it happens, but I basically gaslight myself into thinking that none of the cheating happened. I stop worrying if there was more, like if she actually met up with these guys. We go on the trip. Again it seems amazing. And then, the vibe shifts again when we return.

1 week later, we're having a dumb argument again. She's telling me she doesn't like that I get frustrated in traffic sometimes (not yelling or raging, just sighing or complaining in a soft voice). She tells me she needs someone who is further along in their emotional regulation. That she's been working with her life coach to be ""calm af"" which is apparently her life coach's motto and that she needs a partner who is on her level, and she's not sure about me. I start to lose it. I don't yell, or act threatening at all, but I say in a calm voice ""Well a month ago you were talking to 4 other guys behind my back to emotionally regulate, so don't be so condescending"". She looks at me with a completely dead expression, and says ""this is over"". I say what do you mean, and she says ""the relationship is over"". I'm in shock - I calmly grab my bag and leave. I haven't spoken to her since.

The first couple days I was just in a fog. I kind of thought I'd just get over it quickly. I was waking up from a bad dream, this person wasn't my person. She lied to me. But then, the doubt started building. I started thinking this was the best connection I've ever had. I've never been so excited to be with someone, to plan a future with someone. She could be so loving. She wrote me sooo many love notes. I literally got one in the mail the day after she ended things, written on a post card just a few days earlier. She printed pictures of us and put them in frames. She kissed me so passionately. She hugged me and held me and made me feel like I was enough. And then she ended things without explanation in the middle of a dumb fight. She blocked me on everything. I didn't try to reach out ever. I unfollowed her everywhere in the first week but just yesterday I impulsively checked her instagram and I saw I was blocked. It's now been a little over 2 weeks and I can barely sleep. I know deep down that this was too much for a 6 month relationship. If she's already cheating on me with multiple other men ~4 months in, that's a terrible sign. But my brain keeps contradicting itself. I blame myself for our last ever conversation going the way it went. For saying something so mean to her. I blame myself for not asking her to reconsider, and just leaving. I blame myself for not apologizing the day after. I wonder if she was already talking or seeing someone else. Part of it too is that I started to get a vibe like she was being shady that last weekend. She showed up really late to something with a bad excuse. But I have no idea. No proof of anything. All I have is complete silence and separation. Like nothing ever happened. We literally hung out nearly every single day for the last 5 months, and she threw me away like I was nothing.

Some days I feel a little OK. But most of the time I am thinking about her. Most of the time I am wondering if I'll ever feel that good again. And a lot of the time I hate myself for putting myself through all of that when there were such big red flags in the beginning.

There's even more shit that I don't even know where or how to add (one of the guys she was talking to is diagnosed BPD and they had a really weird history. He's married and his wife hates her. He was telling her maybe she should try polyamory and that she should be with someone more on ""her level"" to be in a power couple). This is already so long though so I guess I'll leave it here. But she also discarded several other close friends even while we were together (one of them seemed particularly harsh - she wrote her an email telling her everything that was wrong with her and why they couldn't hang out, it seemed cruel to me at the time but I looked the other way).

How do I get over this? How do I stop hoping she'll come back and apologize for abandoning me like this, after I forgave her for fucking cheating on me? I’m just so confused about what any of it meant",3,1747845700.0,BPDlovedones,3,1.0,False

Just wanna share because i am feeling gloomy for the past days because of this. Medyo mahaba yata to hahah 
So read at your risk

I have a best friend for over 10 years..
Nagkaroon kami ng issue 2 years ago because of of her gf. Yes, you saw it right my friend is a bisexual.

Her gf is threatened to me.
When i heard na may away sila naganap because of me, as a girl of course lumayo nalang ako i even initiated to cut off our friendship just for the sake of my friends happiness , masaya sya sa girl e.
well she agreed naman to cut it off.

Medyo masakit sa akin syempre parang ganun nalang ba yun after 10 years mabilis lang ako alisin sa life nya.

So both agreed, she blocked me first and I blocked her afterwards as well.

After almost months i guess, exactly on my birthday my friend greeted me and she created another acc for that.

I am so happy that time kasi i really thought we are over. She mentioned to me she cant cut off our relationship or even just a communication.
Since kinausap nya ko i really taught i am fine with her gf na.Naguusap naman kami madalas lang.

This year we met after 2 years, sadly sa lamay ng papa nya. That time was so heartbreaking talaga kasi parang nagkaroon kami ng reunion however in that dark time pa.

I feel sorry to her , i even apologized na doon pa
kami nagkuasap, nagkamustahan even kahit papano malapit lang mga bahay namin.

After ng libing ng papa nya, i asked her out for a coffee just to have a heart to heart to talk from everything most especially becuase of our issue before. We apologized with each other and reconciled.

I can see we are both happy when we see each other here since we live in the same community.
She mentioned to me that she broke with her because she finally believing in God and yun na bawal daw ganun na.

Wala naman ako care doon, wherever shes happy or kung ano pa yan, doon ako.

So ito lang ang nakapasakit sakin now.

Last month siguro , i met my friend again and unexpectedly shes with her ex gf daw.
I was very shocked that time na magkasama sila .
First i didnt notice instantly shes there so ayun i greeted her y ,i talked to her a lot , she even insisted to pay for  my fare since sa cab kami and i teased her kasi bakit nya ako nililibre.
Doon ko lang napansin kasi parang kinakabahan yung friend ko kaya chineck ko kasama and ueah that her ex daw sabi nya.

So again i domt care if they are back with each other.

Last election we met again, i greeted her , we look okay .
 
Its just that last sunday, i noticed na parang di ma nag pa pop up yung name ng friend ko sa fb ko so i checked then nagulat nalang ako inunfriend na nya ako.

My jaw dropped talaga, and my heart sinked.
Ito na naman tayo ganun nalang ka dali naman.
She unfriend me guys, its means we are over di ba?

Bakit ganun parang wala na naman yung friendship namin. Nasasaktan lang ako now.
I treated her just like my sister , shes one of my closest and favorite person.

Hjndj naman ako clingy sa kanya , my last convo with her is months ago pa yata just to guve her space .

Pag nagkikita kami in person ,accidental lanh
Pero why she needed to unfriend without telling me anything?
do i need to confront her?
what if confront her and then magkaroon anamn ako issue witb her ex if nagkabalikan nga sila.

Or i will just silently accept that our friendship is over right??

i really dont deserve this

By working here, you’re not just wearing a uniform—you’re part of a system that turns a blind eye to exploitation. You think the issue is the dress code? No. The issue is much deeper.

If the uniform is your breaking point, then quit. Don’t stage a walkout—it won’t get you anywhere. Everyone is replaceable, even store managers.

Instead, think local. Got a neighborhood coffee shop? Support them—or better yet, join their team. Got a van? Turn it into a mobile café and park outside a Starbucks. Got a few savings? Rent a tiny storefront, start your own shop, hire your friends, build something real.

Yeah, not everyone has the resources. But some of you do. Take a risk. Worst case? It fails. But Starbucks is already failing you—and you’re still showing up.

Whatever you choose, I hope it works out for you. Seriously. Just don’t forget—you’ve got options.",0,1747845570.0,starbucks,5,0.49,False

About 3 months ago, I began experiencing consistently softer stools (Bristol 5–7) with no pain. After a few tests, my doctor suspects IBS. 
I rarely get severe diarrhea, but I usually need to go in the morning after I drink my coffee, which is also right after when I take the pill. I'm unsure if these softer stools count as diarrhea and if it could affect pill absorption. I'm starting IBS meds soon and am scared of implant options. 
Should I be concerned? Would changing the time I take my pill help?

1ks2egn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ks2egn/was_i_ta_in_my_old_relationship/,Was I TA in my old relationship?,"More than a year ago I split up from a woman I'd been dating for a year.  Things were serious to the point that we had planned to move in together and blend our children etc etc.  In retrospect it was all too fast and I was being pulled along by wanting to please her, not by rationality or good sense.  Once I recovered those senses and started asking hard questions of her and things went to hell and we split.

Forgetting the rest of the nonsense, I am left with a hangover of sorts.

Before we got together, she was honest and told me she had ADHD, Lupus and inflammitory arthritus.  My sister has lupus so I had a good understanding of it and wasn't afraid.  She was registered as disabled as her conditions would never improve enough to go back to work so she was on benefits etc.  She had two very sweet twins who were autistic who were lovable too.

She and I quickly began to spent lots of time together and I fell for her hard. 

I quickly learned what tasks would zap her energy the quickest and would step up as much as I could to take things off of her so she could have more energy for other things.  Her mobility wasn't always great so I even helped her make changes to her home to make things easier etc.  For example, she would struggle to take the kettle to the sink, fill it and then take it back to put it onto boil.  I got her a static hot water machine that I would fill every day for her so she could have tea whenever she wanted without struggling with the kettle.  I did it because I wanted the woman I loved to have less struggles in her life.  

This extended to lots of little things in general.  Sometimes her finger joints would swell so I would give her hand massages etc.  In the mornings sometimes her feet would be swollen so I'd rub them for her and get them comfy enough to walk on.  I also got her daily pill storage pots and filled her pills so she didn't struggle with getting them out of packets etc.  I did these things out of love and concern because I wanted to help her wherever I could.  It broke my heart to see her in pain and suffering so I would do anything I could to help her.  

With lupus you can have energy one day and none for the next three if you push yourself too hard.  That is the same as my sisters lupus.  I accepted it totally that it could be an unpredictable future but I'd made peace with it.  Fast forward a few months and things began to grate on me a lot.  

She would always have energy to go out with her best friend during the day for coffee or lunches or whatever else but when it came to my time to spend time with her, I always got the exhuasted version of her that just wanted to doze on the sofa or lay under a blanket and binge watch trash TV.  If she had fallen asleep on the sofa after I'd gotten there to spend an evening / night with her, she would ""wake up"" about 11.30pm and would then keep me awake for hours knowing I had to be up at 6.30 to go to work.  She would get upset and blame her ADHD and make me feel bad for feeling tired etc even though she could go back to bed once she'd dropped her kids to school each morning etc. 

After biting my tongue and just sucking it up for months I one day asked her: ""if we have arranged to actually go somewhere or do something together, could she potentially skip going out for lunches or coffee mornings with her friend for the day prior so there would be a better chance of us actually getting to do something other than sit in on the sofa?"".  I'm paraphrasing myself here but I am always gentle and diplomatic in how I talk to people. 

She went mad and accused me of trying to use her illness to control her and who she sees.  Then she told me I was being narcassistic by demanding she change her life to suit me rather than us work together.

I asked her ""When do we work together exactly because you do what YOU want and WE do what YOU want"".  I then realised that in almost a year, we'd been out for dinner only 3 times, lunch perhaps twice whereas in the last month alone, she'd been out for lunches with her friend at least 12 times and it hurt me badly.

This is all in the past but I am still torturing myself, was ITA and was there any truth to her accusations about me trying to be controlling of her or being childish that others were getting what I wasn't?

But in our industry people are so entitled to sit at an empty table for as long as they can. Now, my place has a dining time limit thankfully, but it's still kinda odd how people will pay the bill (or not) and just sit and talk with their friend til the cows come home and we are expected to accommodate it. If the service is over then I should be done serving you. Why am I expected to hover over you indefinitely, waiting to close out, if you are no longer paying? 

In my opinion, you are being offered a *service* and a *product*. Once you've finished use of that product or the service is over you should be expected to leave as soon as possible.

My analogies/arguments are:

1. You're getting your hair cut. Your hairdresser finishes the cut and styles your hair for you so the service is officially over. At this point we get out of the seat, pay, and leave so they can provide service for the next person, right? But imagine if you just stayed seated and was like nah, I'm gunna text on my phone for a bit or chat with my friend who I brought. That'd be insane! But that's what people do in restaurants. 

2. You're getting an oil change. Another service that is provided by a person. Imagine they finish and close your hood and you just go naaah, I'm gunna finish my Starbucks drink before I start my car and leave. This would back up everyone else waiting to get their oil changed but this is literally what's acceptable in the food service industry.

We put up with so much *shit* in this industry and it irks me that people still don't think we deserve respect. I mean, we accomate deadly allergies, picky preferences, hangry-ness, children/toddlers, germs and spit, literal shit and piss because we're responsible for the bathrooms as well, people demanding when their table/food will be ready. Bit**, you ordered a well done steak!!! 

People often don't even greet me or let me welcome them in. I'll walk up to the table and say, ""Good afternoon folks-"" only to be cut off with ""Coffee.""

I think we put up with too much in this industry and the general public needs to be reeled in soon. Covid proved that the general public was insane and I wish it was more socially acceptable for service workers to actually take the reigns and tell people off.

Hi everyone! I’m doing a bit of research for the food & beverage industry, specifically to understand what kind of meals and snacks would appeal most to people working in tech or IT environments in Sri Lanka.

If your office had a proper cafeteria or food court, what would you love to see on the menu?
I’d really appreciate your honest input on the following:

• Breakfast: What would make your mornings better? Quick grab-and-go or something hearty?

• Lunch: Do you prefer full meals, rice bowls, pastas, wraps, or healthier stuff like salad bars?

• Dinner (for late workers): Would you eat at the cafeteria again or order in?

• Snacks: What do you crave between work sessions? Sandwiches, samosas, protein bars, pastries?

• Desserts: Would you go for gelato, soft serve, or even something fun like bubble tea?

• Drinks: Would you want specialty coffee/tea, energy drinks, or even beer (if allowed)?

• Healthy Options: Do you actively try to eat clean? Would you go for low-carb, high-protein or vegan options if they were tasty?

Also, if you've ever had a great cafeteria experience at your workplace, I’d love to hear what made it memorable!

Thanks in advance—this will really help shape a new food concept designed for modern workspaces.",1,1747844871.0,srilanka,2,1.0,False

I already start earlier (have to wake up 6 am to get to work), I get pay way less even tho they give me events to coordinate too, I cannot go whenever for coffee or the toilet without someone covering me so I need to beg people to let me go. And on top of that they are incapable of coming down for 5pm to let me go at my scheduled time. They always say they will come and take 10-20 min.

I called her once and left a message and told me she was going to call me back but she didn't and on Monday I meet her she tells me that she was drunk all weekend (which she does all the time) then apologizes and tells me that she wanted to send me a message, I ask her if she is sure if she wants us to have coffee together and that I don't mind if she changes her mind, she insists on the fact that she wants to have coffee with me and and insists on the fact that she contacts me again this evening or next year tomorrow and then still no message knowing that it’s my neighbor and that we’re going to meet again.

Hey everyone!
I’m part of the team behind enrichx.io, a platform we built to solve a problem we constantly saw in the fintech space: raw transaction data is messy, inconsistent, and borderline useless for real analytics or customer-facing experiences without heavy lifting.

So we built an API that enriches financial transaction data in real-time. It identifies the merchant, categorizes the transaction, and cleans up ambiguous strings like “POS 123456 CAIRO EG” into something readable and insightful (e.g., “Starbucks - Coffee Shop”).

Some cool stuff we’ve implemented:
	•	Real-time enrichment with >95% accuracy
	•	Local merchant recognition (especially useful in MENA)
	•	Easy REST API integration
	•	Scalable for banks, PFM apps, and analytics platforms

We’re already seeing great results with partners, and would love feedback or thoughts from the Reddit community. Whether you’re building a personal finance app, running data science at a neobank, or just curious about how this works — I’d love to chat or give you access to test the API.

Ask me anything — or hit me up if you want a demo!",2,1747844390.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False
