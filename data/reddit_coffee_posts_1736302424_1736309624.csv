Hi! I'm not much of a breakfast person. And am in my first week of Whole 30.  Prior to starting I'd have a couple cups of coffee with cream when I first got up around 730 & then would get hungry around 9-10 & then make breakfast.

Now, in my first few days I've been sure to eat something with my black coffee at wake up.  Day 1 I had an egg & banana. Today a banana with almond butter.

What are some easier lighter options to have breakfast even though I don't really want to eat.

I'd love some product suggestions or recipes... I did a little looking in the group & will continue to look more. Approved non dairy yogurts maybe?

1hwayli,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1hwayli/veqt_vs_xeqt_for_overthinkers/,VEQT vs XEQT for overthinkers,"I‚Äôm 25 years old and completely new to the world of investing. Recently, I read a book that opened my eyes to how important it is to start investing young. I‚Äôve decided to go the index ETF route with 100% equity for now. I might diversify further as I learn more, but for the time being keeping it simple is my plan. 

After a lot of research, I‚Äôve narrowed my options down to two ETFs: VEQT and XEQT.

Before you roll your eyes and think ""not another VEQT vs. XEQT post‚Äù hear me out! I‚Äôve spent countless hours reading posts, articles, and watching videos on this topic, yet I still feel like the answers I find are repetitive and don‚Äôt fully address the overthinking side of this decision. Yes, I know I‚Äôm overanalyzing, and people often suggest flipping a coin because both ETFs are great options. But for overthinkers like me, flipping a coin doesn‚Äôt cut it. We need to deeply analyze a choice upfront so that we can stick with it long-term and not constantly second-guess ourselves.

This post is for the overthinkers. Hopefully, it will help others like me make a decision and save time that could be spent on more productive endeavors.

After reflecting on the advice to ‚Äúpick one and stick with it‚Äù, I‚Äôm leaning toward VEQT. Here‚Äôs why:

* **Vanguard‚Äôs Philosophy**: I prefer Vanguard‚Äôs approach and mission. Since we can‚Äôt predict whether VEQT or XEQT will (slightly) outperform, I‚Äôd rather choose the ETF aligned with a company whose values resonate with me. If it underperforms, I‚Äôll at least have peace of mind knowing I chose a provider I like.
* **Greater Diversification**: VEQT includes more underlying stocks (13,422 compared to XEQT‚Äôs 8,754). To me, this increases the chances of capturing the ""needle in a haystack"" since only a few rare companies are responsible for a significant portion of market growth.
* **Market-Cap Weighting**: VEQT adjusts its international exposure dynamically based on market cap. I like this flexibility compared to XEQT‚Äôs fixed allocation.
* **Home Bias Justification**: While some criticize VEQT‚Äôs 30% allocation to Canadian equities as excessive, I find it better aligns with the optimal 35% home-country bias Ben Felix discusses [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN8mIHve1Ds&ab_channel=BenFelix).
* **MER Difference**: Yes, VEQT has a slightly higher MER (0.24% vs. 0.20%), but it‚Äôs only $4 per $10,000. I‚Äôm okay with this, especially since Vanguard may reduce its MER in the future to match BlackRock. And if not, I‚Äôll gladly skip one coffee a year for the added benefits I perceive in VEQT.

My questions are:

1. **Sticking with One ETF:** If sticking with one ETF is the best strategy, are there any flaws in my reasoning for preferring VEQT?
2. **Switching Based on MER:** Why not buy XEQT now and switch to VEQT later if Vanguard reduces its MER? What‚Äôs the downside to switching ETFs down the road? Is there a tangible advantage to sticking with just one ETF for the long term?
3. **MER Impact:** A common argument is that the MER difference between VEQT and XEQT doesn‚Äôt matter. While $4 per $10,000 may seem negligible, isn‚Äôt this overlooking the long-term impact of compounding? After all, compounding is the main reason investing is so powerful... Of course, it‚Äôs possible to achieve an even lower total MER by buying individual ETFs and rebalancing manually, but that‚Äôs not a fair comparison since it requires significantly more effort. If XEQT and VEQT are as similar as people often claim, wouldn‚Äôt it be logical to simply choose the ETF with the lowest MER? At what point does the MER difference become significant enough to prioritize?

Thanks for taking the time to read this and for saving me and other fellow overthinkers from endlessly spiraling on this decision!

PS. Sorry for any mistakes or misunderstandings in this post, I‚Äôm still very new to investing and learning as I go!",1,1736309006.0,PersonalFinanceCanada,0,1.0,False

1hwav3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1hwav3n/the_best_the_worst_and_the_weirdest_of_2024/,"The best, the worst, and the weirdest of 2024","My indie perfume journey started exactly a year ago. During 2024 I collected an obscene amount of samples, curiosity getting the best of me. This has become less of a quest to smell good and more of a sensory journey. I learned that I never outgrew my love for the incensey scents I chased in high school, and I'm usually disgusted by the moss/grass/dirt/forest scents I thought I would like. Let's share our top hits, misses, and just unexpected smelly experiences from last year! I know not everyone appreciates a bad review, but personally I think they're really useful when my taste aligns with someone AND when we have totally opposite taste.
   
(**TYPICALLY LOVE:** patchouli, pepper, sandalwood, tobacco, nag champa, wood, booze, clove, hay, ambergris, dark scents, warm scents **SOMETIMES ENJOY IN CERTAIN CONTEXTS:** vanilla, marshmallow, cashmere, smoke, jasmine, paper, bergamot, oud, savory gourmands **TYPICALLY HATE:** cake, fruit, florals, tea, moss, clean or soapy scents, super sugary scents, lavender, ginger, mint)
   
  
THE BEST  
***Pineward*** - **Ponderosa** *(ponderosa resin, ponderosa needles, cedar, vanilla, strawberry, cinnamon, butterscotch, beeswax, raisin cookies)*: Sticky snacks in the forest. Authentically piney. Delightfully sweet without being cloying or sacrificing powerful natureyness, it blends perfectly into the resiny qualities. I don't detect any strawberry (which I'm not mad about). This feels super cozy. I'm in a kitchen witch's cottage in the woods. Or in the midst of an adventure, stopping to remove my secret weapon: endless health in the form of grandma's cookies. This is pretty strong, I only sprayed it twice before work and could still faintly smell it at the end of the day. At the end of its lifespan it's more of a soft, woody vanilla scent. **9/10**  
***Death & Floral*** - **Melodrama** *(black patchouli, cognac, toasted oats)*: This was a free sample in my order and it's my favorite thing I received. Without looking at the notes, I smelled cereal and something deep, dark, and sweet. It all made so much sense when I checked their website. There‚Äôs a pinch of spice to it and mild musky earthiness from the patchouli. Everything blends together super well. This borders on too sweet for me but is saved by unique, alluring depth and warmth. **9/10**  
***Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab*** - **No Man Is An Island** *(patchouli, hazelnut cream, coffee bean, cassis, tonka bean, purple sage, bourbon vanilla)*: This starts out strictly coffee on my skin. Sweetened, creamy coffee. It darkens intensely while drying and gains a funky, almost incensey quality. The first thing it made me think of is a quirky, artsy coffee shop. One that is probably poorly lit and overpriced with an exposed brick wall. This is a unique scent that inhabits a strange, in-between place. Sweet gourmand with funky patchouli with dry sage. Definitely unisex. Incredibly rich and warm. One friend said it reminded them of maple syrup and another friend said the sage reminded them of sausage. I still have no regrets. **9/10**  
***Solstice Scents*** - **Sawmill** *(fresh cut wood, wood resin, balsam, cured woods, pine, black coffee, motor oil, amber, saw dust)*: For the first few minutes this is a gust of crisp, coffee-scented air. As it dries it becomes very woody and vaguely floral? Maybe it's just the combination of increasing sweetness and woodsiness that's making my brain say it's floral. An oily quality becomes prominent. Interesting and unique blend that's dark, sweet woods and oil. You're a lumberjack drinking a latte. My boyfriend said it smells super diesely and sweet. **10/10**  
***Hexennacht*** - **Loup-Garou** *(silver amber, fur, lunar musk)*: Holy shit this is good. I don't even know what else to say about it or what to compare it to. I feel like it's a unisex scent, if a man wore this it would make me feral. Musky, sweet, pleasant. Somehow leans slightly cool. I don't know what I'm smelling, I just need more. **10/10**  
***Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab*** - **Blood Kiss** *(vanilla, honey, clove, cherries, vetiver, poppy, red wine, musk)*: Oh my god I love this. A deep and dark sweet instead of a light and sugary sweet. Spicy, musky, incensey. A lot of reviews said they could imagine a vampire wearing this and I definitely envision some sort of alluring creature lurking in the forest. Feels playful and summery despite the dark elements. It gets a bit more earthy and tart as time goes on. I loved it from start to finish. My boyfriend said it smells like ‚Äúelegant cherries‚Äù and my coworker said it smells like incense. **10/10**  
   
THE WORST  
***Alkemia*** - **Au Lait** *(rich, creamy milk swirled with tonka, wild honey, and a cozy touch of caramelized brown sugar)*: In the bottle it smells like straight cheese and I feel very brave for putting this on my skin. Yep, that's cheese. It lightens as it dries, there's a weirdly pretty warmth and a gentle, honey sweetness. Tragically this is paired with the persistent smell of funky milk. This would be fun if the milk wasn't spoiled! I made my boyfriend smell it, he immediately made a face and said ""Bad milk?? Cheese?? Why does it smell like that??"" **2/10** Part of the reason it's not a 0/10 is simply because I'm intrigued by an accurate dairy smell existing.  
***Haus of Gloi*** - **Essence Of The Forest** *(ferns, moss, toadstool, a hint of caramel)*: It starts out with a burst of earthy, almost savory, mushroomy weirdness. This takes a back seat pretty quickly and makes room for fresh, airy woodsyness. It definitely gives me the vibe I‚Äôm lying by a mythical creek on a bed of moss and mushrooms, or drinking a wizard‚Äôs brew. Super green, interesting, but too sharp and makes me nauseous. **2/10**  
***Morari*** - **Quinn** *(maple sugar, tonka, leather, labdanum, oud, smoke)*: Super leathery and smokey with a teensy pinch of sweetness and a whisper of something floral. Other people described this as warm, sugary, cozy, but I'm not getting that. This toes the line between badass and barbecue. That doesn't change much even as it dries and slightly more sweetness comes out. **2/10**  
***Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab*** - **The Dodo** *(red musk, lemon peel, sugar cane, cassia, white sandalwood, mango, agarwood)*: Citrusy musk. Started out fruity and dark, bitter but yummy. As it dries it becomes straight lemon. Tragically teeters on the edge of lemon pledge. **1/10**    
***Hexennacht*** - **Tartelette** *(lemon curd, passion fruit curd, vanilla extract, custard white chocolate)*: This was a free sample and something I'm going to give to a friend because it's so far from my taste. When I first put it on my skin it's straight sweet tarts. The longer it sits, the richer it becomes. After about 30 minutes, there's an odd transformation from super tart and sugary candy to white chocolate with a zesty tang in the background. This is definitely for someone else. **1/10**  
***Sucreabeille*** - **Attempted Murder** *(oakmoss, bonfire, cypress, suede, osmanthus)*: Overwhelmingly sharp and smokey. I smell something almost enjoyable but then everything smells too intensely strange and astringent. Somewhat woodsy. A bonfire where we're burning trash that's destroying the ozone. **1/10**  
    
THE WEIRD  
***Alkemia*** - **Writer's Blood** *(iron-tinged blood, a manuscript soaked with spilled coffee, tobacco)*: This is appropriately strange. Not as gross as I feared it could be. Prominent warm tobacco accompanied by something sharp and metallic. You're almost seduced by a cozy, warm scent and then you're terrified by iron and blood. Shockingly it almost smells good once it dries? I think I just love tobacco a lot. **6/10** mostly for creativity but it's also kind of good??  
***Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab*** - **Soup** *(pepper, tomato, patchouli)*: This is super bright and green and very reminiscent of a real tomato plant. It comes across more savory, herby, gardeny, than straight up tomato soup. Patchouli barely peaks through after drying, adding a mild woody quality that elevates the sense you're shoving your nose into plants. After about an hour, it's simply a dry, herby patchouli. Better throw than I expected but not the best longevity of my BPAL oils. 10/10 for being accurate, weird, and pleasant but brought down to a **7/10** because I doubt I will ever wear it outside.    
***Hexennacht*** - **Reefer Madness** *(skunky, weedy, dried bud notes, dirt, flannel shirt pocket lint, a faint hint of berries, fir, and apple)*: First impression: fruit snacks. It slowly becomes darker, dirtier fruit snacks? Eventually a dankness shines through that is reminiscent of weed. A green and leafy scent. Almost smells like fresh vegetables. Really interesting and I weirdly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad. Somehow it‚Äôs dark and musty, hiding in your friend‚Äôs basement to light up. Sweet, light, fruity, you‚Äôre devouring fruit roll ups. A vague GREEN quality, occasionally a whiff that feels cucumbery? It generally smells sort of damp? I have no idea what I‚Äôm smelling and it‚Äôs not totally accurate cannabis but it does capture a strange, youthful, stoner spirit. I don't think I would ever wear this but it‚Äôs creative and interesting. **7/10**  
***Pulp*** - **Hallowed Ground** *(soil, damp air, decaying wood, black honey, dark chocolate, moss, incense)*: Oh this is STRANGE. Truly smells like damp soil. You're in a terrifying forest ripe with decay and for some reason rolled rich, dark chocolate in the mud. I actually hate this but the notes are so accurate and so weird I can't hate it. **3/10**   
***Fyrinnae*** - **Focaccia Toscana** *(olive oil, thyme, oregano, flatbread)*: A delightful, photorealistic bread smell. It starts out very warm and yeasty, over time bright herbs shine through. Italian cottagecore milf vibes. I didn't expect to enjoy this so much! Tragically this only lasts about two hours on my skin. **8/10**  
***Fyrinnae*** - **Starship Mechanic** *(titanium, engine oil, bergamot, woods, patchouli)*: Pretty yet masculine, oily yet almost clean? This is ART. Slight sharpness from the engine oil and citrusy bergamot paired with a light patchouli. There's not much to say about this because they just fully hit the mark of what a starship mechanic would smell like in my idealized sci-fi visions. Something I will probably very rarely wear but it's just excellent. **9/10**   
***Mythpunk Olfactive*** - **Babygirl** *(motor oil, indonesian & bourbon vetiver, leather, virginia cedarwood, marshmallow, ironing board musk)*: It starts out with heavy motor oil and this hot, distinctly steamy quality. Genuinely smells like ironing clothes. Over time it softens and sweetens and turns into something really strange but delightful. There‚Äôs a dark, sweet, fluffy, almost nuttiness to it. Steamy fog and fluffernutter clouds producing a motor oil downpour. Confusing in a magical way. **9/10**  ",5,1736308700.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôll say what I understood him to say, and you correct me where wrong please: 

- home water filtration falls into 2 main categories:  water softening (removing calcium, magnesium, and other chemicals that will cause scale buildup) and water filtration such as reverse osmosis or other popular techniques (removing loads of other chemicals, including some that may be harmful like lead, and other that affect taste, and bio-organisms which are just gross‚Äîbut this will not remove the calcium or magnesium, etc) 
- water softening is a system that comes only whole-house sizes. You won‚Äôt find one that goes under your kitchen sink. 
- water filtration comes in many sizes. You can find one that goes under your kitchen sink. A very inexpensive method is a Brita filter, which doesn‚Äôt even need to be plumbed in. 
- the cleanest and purest water is achieved by utilizing both types, in this order:  1st soften the water, then filter it. 
- if you only soften your water (without also doing filtration) ‚Äúit won‚Äôt prevent the need to descale your coffee machine.‚Äù  I was surprised when my plumber said this, as I‚Äôm almost certain he is wrong. But maybe I am wrong ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   For coffee machines, the best bet is to use filtered water (like reverse osmosis) is what he said.  Sure, that may taste good, but I don‚Äôt want scale buildup, especially if I own a very expensive espresso machine (>$2000). 
- softened wafer is dangerous to drink because of the salt. When you have a system installed on your house, the kitchen specifically has some sort of feedback loop (or some mechanism) that prevents it from being dangerous.  Again, I was surprised when he said all this. As I understand, softened water is perfectly safe to drink. 
- even filtered water is not a good idea to drink because it removes the healthy minerals.  Again, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that I get my minerals from In N Out. The only time I consume faucet water is when I use it in coffee machines or make butternut squash soup.  Neither of those are significant enough to cause concern, so it struck me as an odd take. 

Overall, the main goal I had was to find an easy and convenient way to soften my kitchen water in my apartment and also to filter it, so that my coffee and espresso (and pumpkin soups) can achieve Michelin status.  But there simply isn‚Äôt a way to do it in an apartment (because water softening systems are not built for under-kitchen-sink plumbing).  The easiest solution is to install a whole-house system for a few thousand, plus buy a house for $1.2 million. So that‚Äôs my next goal. ",1,1736308050.0,WaterTreatment,1,1.0,False

1hwaiuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexualHarassment/comments/1hwaiuo/sexual_harrasment_at_work/,Sexual Harrasment at work ,"Hello reddit 

This is my very first post, and since English is not my first language, I hope you‚Äôll be kind.

I‚Äôm writing this to vent because I‚Äôm going through a really tough time, and I feel mentally and emotionally exhausted. I‚Äôd also love to hear from anyone who has faced a similar experience and might have advice to share.

Here‚Äôs the context:
2024 has been a challenging year for me, especially when it comes to employment. After several months of being unemployed, I finally landed a job. I was happy, even though the salary was much lower than what I used to earn in my previous role.

Unfortunately, I soon realized the workplace was extremely toxic. The General Manager constantly scolded employees, monitored when we went to the bathroom or grabbed coffee, and even tracked how often we talked to each other. It felt like we were expected to sit silently, staring at our screens all day. There were many other unpleasant situations, and the constant harassment made me feel helpless. So, I started looking for a new job.

The next job I found was, once again, underpaid, but I was hopeful that this time things would be different. Honestly, I was willing to sacrifice a higher salary for a healthier work environment. Unfortunately, I was wrong. This new workplace is even worse.

The HR manager, who is the only person in charge of the office in my country, is a man in his 70s. Let‚Äôs call him OC (Old Creepster). From the start, he has made inappropriate comments with clear sexual connotations. He has told me he‚Äôd like to spank me, invited me to his house so he could cook for me, and asked invasive questions about my sex life. He‚Äôs even made comments about how he thinks a penis should be inserted into a vagina and described how he feels during sex with prostitutes. Not only toe but to several ladies in the office. 

I feel deeply harassed and vulnerable. I don‚Äôt want to stay in this job, but I can‚Äôt afford to quit right now.

I‚Äôve tried to address this by reporting the situation to the company owner, who lives in the U.S., but theu have ignored or dismissed my complaints.

Recently, my mental health has taken a serious hit. I‚Äôve developed PTSD, severe depression, and panic attacks, and I‚Äôve been on sick leave for over two weeks. I‚Äôve been trying to pursue legal action, but in my country, both the government and the company seem to be protecting OC.

To make things worse, I recently received an emails from OC claiming that my mental health issues and absences are affecting my performance. He suggested that I resign, stating there‚Äôs no proof my health problems are related  to the workplace environment 

Really dude?!! What about the almost daily sexual harassment, constant scolding, excessive workload, low pay, and complete lack of care for employee well-being?

At this point, I feel hopeless and unsure of what to do. I know this isn‚Äôt a happy story, and I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs hard to read about mental health issues. I just feel desperate. I wish I could find a job where I could finally feel safe and happy‚Äîtruly happy and be able to heal out of this horrible situation.

Thanks for letting me take this out of my chest ",1,1736307603.0,SexualHarassment,0,0.99,False

1hwaibm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipanxiety/comments/1hwaibm/is_this_relationship_anxiety_or_was_there_no/,"Is this relationship anxiety, or was there no attraction to begin with and I really am not into it? ","So I asked this person out because I kept being told she likes me. Initially said no because she is ten years younger than me (she is 24) and Im friends with her brother. I thought she was cute, and she comes from a great family (our family are friends), so I thought why not. I haven't tried to date anyone in years due to rejection and I'm a generally anxious person because of that, but I thought I had to try. I even went along with the ""conservative right way"" to date and asked permission (brother was ok with it) because we're middle eastern.

From the get go all I can think about was ""she is way too young, how will this work.""  There is nothing wrong with her as a person, and ""on paper"" I thought it would work. I thought it SHOULD work, because someone pretty, young and single actually likes me and our families already like each other. I thought maybe I would be pleasantly surprised and we'd hit it off.  Coffee date was pleasant, but awkward. There was no real flirting just a lot of questions. I didn't feel anything, there was a few turn offs, but it was pleasant and I just waved it off as nervousness. Then later, there were so many things I was uncomfortable with that went beyond the age gap over the course of next 2 dates in 2 more weeks. I went in hoping to build an attraction, but there's still nothing. I even became a bit unattracted.

It was this part of the post that I just listed all the differences, hoping to have people agree with me in my justification of unattraction. Her lack of hobbies, our political differences, different upbringings, communication styles etc... to me they are red flags and signs of incompatibility but I realize to any one from outside looking in, they're nitpicks. ""Stop whining, your old, she likes you, just pick her."" 

I hear of couples all the time who have these differences. These dates are great hangouts, even if they are just basically me answering a bunch of questions, and vice versa, even if I don't like how she answers them. She really is a sweet girl, and I can tell she likes me or is at least really trying after our dates. She ""fits the bill."" I'm a doctor, she's a nurse. We're the same ethnicity and religious background.... But I can't bring myself to be attracted to her. I don't feel turned on like I did with the others. I don't feel captivated. 

But you know what I do feel? Between every date and text message, my stomach sinks and I feel anxiety and dread about the situation I'm in. 

All this time there were never sparks, its just me trying to push myself to keep things going to see if I could feel something, but I keep hyper focusing on the turn offs and the thought of ending it with this person gives me such dread to the point where my stomach aches and my skin feels like pins and needles. And it's not so simple to break it off because I'm getting older, I probably can't do better, I'm friends with her brother, the family really likes me and a voice (and family) keeps suggesting I'm being a coward.

Usually when I like someone, I've built up the attraction before asking them out, and I'm thinking about them in constant admiration, fantasizing about going on adventures with them, how to make them stay interested, how to appeal to them etc etc. I've felt it before. 

But the attraction isn't here. Instead, the anxiety is about ""why haven't I felt the feelings yet"" and ""why is the attraction not there,"" ""why am I not excited to talk to them"" after just a few dates. I keep having these intrusive thoughts about how I'm going to word my break up so I don't have her family hate me when I should be having thoughts about what our next date should be and wondering what kind of kisser she is. (We literally haven't held hands, mostly due to cultural reasons). I have literally never rejected someone, and I refuse to ghost someone  which adds to the anxiety... The fear of being a bad person.

I did some digging into ""relationship anxiety"" and thought this was the answer, because if that's what it is, then maybe I should just keep my mouth shut, go to therapy and then the attraction will be there. But ...all the advice about ""relationship anxiety"" I've read keeps in theme of trying to keep the relationship that's been established, and that there was still an underlying attraction. But Im not sure if I fit here because I was trying to *build up* the attraction to begin with. Part of me says it's not gonna work, but I'm always wondering, is it just my anxiety/insecurities telling me it's not gonna work? How do I even know?

So.. does this count? or am I just stressed about having to break it off with someone that's really nice because I failed to be attracted to them?
 
TLDR: I(34m) had 3 dates over 3 weeks of courting this person (24F) and I don't know if it's ""relationship anxiety"" or legitimate feelings extreme guilt when there was barely any attraction to begin with.

Dear fitness diary...

Today was AWESOME! üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ

My first ultra productive day in this ( so far ) five day journey. üí™üèª

I finally don't crave sugar and I ate a under my calorie deficit ( I'm going to meet it, don't worry ) 

I had a Turkey, tomato, cheese wrap for brunch ( interesting choice, I know ) An iced coffee, and for dinner I had some ham and cheese with strawberries, and for a snack I had a delicious Greek yogurt parfait. 

That is not balanced but I'll do better tomorrow for sure! üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª

Me and mama went to the store and we finally had a bit of money to spend on healthy food. I got some strawberries, brocoli, spinach, Mediterranean blend, frozen strawberries and raspberries, chicken, 4 balance cereal, Avocados, Lemons, Bananas, lettuce, Oatmeal, and Greek yogurt. ü•ëüçåü•¨üçãüêî( sorty cute chicken üò¢ )ü•¶üçìüçè

I walked four miles in 01:43:20!!!! The most I've ever intentionally walked in a day. üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü©∑

I also did the stationary bike for 30 minutes ü´¢ 

Anyways, I am super proud of myself and can't wait to start again!

If at any point reading this you figure out we are not a romantic match but you want to be friends that‚Äôs cool too, just state that in your first chat please. 

-I am forever childfree and so are you‚Ä¶ which means we are off to a good start basically lol. 

-I am a fur-mom. If you don‚Äôt like dogs and cats then it won‚Äôt work. We are a package deal. I would prefer a partner with no pets as I have a few and they are ornery in their old age. 

-I do smoke. I am a polite smoker but I know that‚Äôs a deal breaker for many so I‚Äôd rather put that out there now. 

-I don‚Äôt do any drugs and would prefer a partner that didn‚Äôt either. If you smoke tree as often as I drink that wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. 

-I drink occasionally. I wouldn‚Äôt mind a partner who has 1 drink a night if that‚Äôs how you decompress at the end of the day, but an occasional drinker or non-drinker is preferred.

-I value my time. My daily routine is non-negotiable as it involves work, taking care of my fur-babies, cleaning my house, daily hygiene and sleep. I think it‚Äôs important to respect one another‚Äôs routine and free time. Of course there will be time for us to text during the day here and there and calls after work and sometimes before. **what does your daily routine consist of?**

-I am not a morning person. I need my peace & quiet and coffee. I wake up at 6a to clock in at 9a just to mentally prepare myself for work. **are you a morning person or night person?**

-I have a healthy relationship with my parents. I would prefer my partner did with their own parents as well, but I am aware we all grew up differently so if you don‚Äôt I won‚Äôt hold that against you. **what is/was your relationship with your parents like?**

-I am an introverted homebody. Entirely. I don‚Äôt go out weekly or even monthly. I will occasionally go out to eat, go to a movie, go thrifting or go visit my parents but that it is. I used to travel quite a bit but I‚Äôve fallen in love with my space. If you have questions feel free to ask. 

-I do not go to the gym or participate in any sort of workout routine. I take walks occasionally and do ab workouts. I am thankful for good genetics but I know I can‚Äôt continue to ride that out for the rest of my life. If you are a very active person I respect that and maybe that will rub off on me.

-Appearance I am Caucasian, short, and 150lbs. Feel free to ask height, eye color, or hair length/color. **sending a selfie gets you one**

-My hobbies include reading, photography, video games, learning random facts, word searches, coloring, thrifting, sea creatures, walking random parks and anything at the beach. **what are some of your hobbies?**

-I‚Äôm non-religious and I don‚Äôt vote (but I have opinions). You are more than welcome to inquire and I encourage you to share your own beliefs or stances. If you are religious that is fine as long as you don‚Äôt try to convert me or make our relationship revolve around it. If you‚Äôre political I don‚Äôt care. We can agree to disagree as long as you have a vasectomy. 

These are the things I find the most important to share so far. If you have any other questions or concerns feel free to ask. I encourage you to share some things about yourself. *Once again, if you decided we aren‚Äôt a romantic match but are interested in being friends that‚Äôs okay too just please state that in your first message.*",4,1736307212.0,cf4cf,1,1.0,False

1hwabzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hwabzf/how_much_chemistry_is_too_much_chemistry_and_am_i/,How much chemistry is too much chemistry and am I right to be skeptical?,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôve (26F) been on Bumble for about a month or so and I‚Äôve talked to a handful of guys, but there‚Äôs this one guy (25M) who I‚Äôve been texting for a few weeks who I have a lot of chemistry with, and our mutual interest in one another has grown very strong over time. Our texts look like just walls after walls of text and photos back-and-forth, like we just have so much in common and so much to talk about! Despite him wrapping up med school and getting ready to earn his MD while applying for residency, his communication has been very consistent and thoughtful. There‚Äôs been a couple of times where he got really tied up by interviews, and I brought up that his busyness doesn‚Äôt discourage me from being interested in him and that if he ever feels guilty about not getting to respond to me for a day to please not feel sorry. He reassured me right back, saying that he really appreciated it and that he‚Äôs super supportive of my career path and taking space or time to myself when I‚Äôd like, and therefore we both reassured each other that there‚Äôs mutual support between us. 

We were really eager to go on our first date since the holidays are over and he had come back from visiting his family, so we finally went on our first date Saturday. Long story short, we had the same energy in person that we had over text ‚Äî just going on nerdy rants and raving about so many topics and stories and opinions, just everything! When we were wrapping things up, we talked about our intentions with one another and we both agreed that we were looking for something serious. We both hugged at the end of the night, and we touched base later on how we had such an incredibly fun night together, and how we can‚Äôt wait for next Friday to see each other again for coffee. 

But there‚Äôs this tiny part of me that‚Äôs just mystified by all of this, how strongly he seems to feel about me. I‚Äôm basically wondering if it would be unnecessary to ask if he really means what he‚Äôs saying to me, because he sounds very subjectively interested in me, like I‚Äôm apparently his favorite person to text (as is he for me). He‚Äôs very flirtatious and charming, saying he should start charging me rent because of how much space I take up in his head, calling me ‚Äúbrain meltingly perfect‚Äù, and how he‚Äôs afraid he‚Äôs going to become accidentally obsessed with me because of my incredible laugh and how intelligent and gorgeous I am. 

And yes ofc I‚Äôve been screaming like a little fucking fangirl on the daily lmao, but I can feel myself developing feelings for him with all of this mutual attraction. And although I‚Äôm still sorta talking to other guys, how this guy communicates with me makes me feel like he‚Äôs invested in me, and maybe even only me. It makes me wonder if he‚Äôs doing the same as well, like still dating around and talking to other people and such. He‚Äôs making me feel like he holds me in very high regard so far and may want to pursue something more in the near future. But I keep thinking: what if he‚Äôs like this with everyone? I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like it if he‚Äôs giving that same energy to everyone he‚Äôs talking to, you know? Is that wrong of me? Part of me wants to casually bring it up in like some lighthearted banter type of way, but I also think it‚Äôs really none of my business at the end of the day because we‚Äôve been talking for a little less than a month and we literally just went on our first date lol. But on the other hand, the way he‚Äôs been treating me this whole time makes me feel like I‚Äôm like the only one he‚Äôs interested in, like he might be putting me on a pedestal. Idk, I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm justified in my feelings or if I‚Äôm just insecure and it‚Äôs all the early infatuation stage of dating. Please keep in mind it‚Äôs been quite a few years since I‚Äôve put myself out there, and I‚Äôd love to hear what you guys have to say or how you guys would handle it.

1hwabi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hwabi5/i_29f_cant_figure_out_what_went_wrong_in_my/,I (29f) can‚Äôt figure out what went wrong in my relationship with my closest friend (30f) ,"Hi everyone. I (29f) met my friend (30f) on an app specifically for making friends. We clicked instantly, met in person a few months later, and I wish I could say the rest was history. We‚Äôve known each other for about 2.5 years now and live about 15-20 minutes apart. 

The first year after meeting in person, we hung out at least once a month and it was the kind of friendship where we would go to one of our homes and just talk for hours. Like it would literally be past midnight and we‚Äôd have totally lost track of time. I felt like it was the friendship I had been looking for my entire life. It didn‚Äôt seem like any topics were off limits, and honestly it was my most emotionally intimate relationship. We had fun together, texted basically every day, and everything seemed mutual. 

The next year (this past year), I was hit by depression. It was the most I‚Äôve ever struggled with my mental health in my adult life. I‚Äôm generally not an open person about this kind of thing due to trauma, so I started to isolate myself. She didn‚Äôt really reach out, and I would just return to our text convo after several days or weeks and things would continue like normal. 

I realized I really needed support and decided to try to be more direct - another thing I struggle with, but am really working on in therapy and my relationships in general. I texted her and told her that I was struggling with my mental health, needed support, and felt like I wasn‚Äôt worthy of friendship at that point. She replied and said she hadn‚Äôt experienced that herself, and that her female friendships are all about talking and support. I also said that I felt like I just needed someone to show up for me, and she said that everybody is busy with their own lives and wants support for themselves, and maybe I should ask someone else (my husband specifically, which is kind of obvious advice and I think your support circle should consist of more than just your spouse). It broke me. I had put so much effort into being vulnerable and reaching out to a trusted person for support, and felt like she proved exactly what I told her I was worried about (that I wasn‚Äôt worthy of friendship or support). 

I went into a pretty extreme depression after that and even relapsed with an addiction that I had been clean from for over a decade. Anyways, this past year I‚Äôve felt like she‚Äôs been totally uninterested in hanging out or having any kind of deep friendship. We saw each other maybe 5 times last year, and most of them were quick hangouts at a coffee shop. Nothing like our 8+ hour convos from the year before. I tried to initiate many many other hangouts and kept getting the ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to check my schedule.‚Äù Which is totally fair, but then check your schedule and let me know if you‚Äôre available, right? She also seemed cagey about spending time with other friends, often telling me she was just taking time for herself, or alluding that she was hanging out with her husband, just for me to see photos of her hanging out with other people on social media. 

She just had two weeks off of work for the holidays and said she didn‚Äôt have a whole lot going on. I asked if she wanted to hang out and she said she would check her schedule. Those two weeks have come and gone and although we‚Äôve texted a bit, she never got back to me about hanging out. Also for context, she runs several errands multiple times a month that are literally within 3 minutes driving distance of my home, and I‚Äôm 5 minutes away from her home at least once a week. 

If you‚Äôre still reading, thank you üôèüèª Am I asking for too much out of my friendship? Is it unrealistic to hope a friend like this would be receptive to my ask for support, or even just send me a text saying like hey I know you‚Äôve been struggling, is there anything I can do? Am I missing something? 

Sometimes I think she just wanted a friend who was happy and easy to be around, and isn‚Äôt interested in being there when I‚Äôm struggling. I also feel like I was the shiny new friend for a while, and then became uninteresting and she moved on. I‚Äôve asked if she‚Äôs had stuff going on, wanted to talk about anything, etc. and it‚Äôs usually just been that she‚Äôs busy (work, gym, groceries, pets, etc) and burnt out. But she has not communicated that she doesn‚Äôt have the capacity or bandwidth for me right now. It‚Äôs just so hard to feel like I‚Äôve lost my friend on top of everything else I‚Äôve been dealing with, but I can‚Äôt keep pouring into people who won‚Äôt pour into me. I‚Äôm just wondering if there‚Äôs another perspective that I haven‚Äôt considered. There‚Äôs a lot more I could say, but this is already a novel, so I won‚Äôt. Thank you all! 

TLDR: I had a great friendship with someone who seemed emotionally open and receptive. I started hardcore struggling with depression and felt her pull away. I‚Äôm not sure what to do or how to interpret this.

Lance Hedrick Ultimate Pourover Recipe



**Big Variables to manipulate**

* Brew ratio
* Water temp

\*Grind size is a 3rd variable to consider



**Brew Ratio**

* Light roast = 1:17
* Medium roast = 1:15 or 1:16
* Dark roast = 1:14 or 1:15



A lower brew ratio will yield a lower extraction but higher strength

A higher brew ratio will yield a higher extraction but lower strength (‚Äúmore watery‚Äù)



**Temperature**

* Light roast = 203-212 F (95-100C)
* Medium roast = 194-203 F (90-95C)
* Dark roast = 185-194F (85-90C)



**Grind Size**

* Grinding finer will decrease flow rate
* Grinding coarser will increase flow rate



**Recipe**

* Only 2 pours: 1 pour for the bloom, 1 bloom for the extraction
* Bloom = 3x weight of coffee, 1:00 - 2:00 in length
   * Use a longer bloom for very lightly roasted coffee or coffee that is very gassy
* Pour = 6-8g per second until final weigh achieved (as determined by brew ratio)
   * Can practice pouring - should take 10s to pour 60-80 grams of coffee
   * Want the height of the kettle to be high enough to render a stream that breaks just below the water line¬†



**Process**

1. Using a stick, make a divot in the center of the coffee grounds
2. Pour bloom to wet all the grounds and excavate the grounds with a spoon
3. Allow the kettle temp to decline between the 1st pour (bloom) and 2nd pour
4. Pour determined water at 6-8 g/s in the center 25mm of the bed until final weight is achieved
5. Observe the draw down and assess speed
   1. If the draw down is too fast, can add agitation with a swirl, wet WDT, or excavation of the bed with a spoon. This will affect fines migration
   2. If the draw down is appropriate speed, can lightly swirl the bed to level it
6. Observe the brew time‚Ä¶
   1. If the bloom time used is 1:00, then the total brew time should finish in 2-3minutes
   2. If the bloom time used is 2:00, then the total brew time should finish in 3-4 minutes



\*Lance stated that multiple pours (>2) may increase bitterness

1hwa1ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hwa1ou/i_29f_feel_like_im_losing_my_closest_friend_30f/,I (29f) feel like I‚Äôm losing my closest friend (30f) because of my mental health struggles ,"Hi everyone. I (29f) met my friend (30f) on an app specifically for making friends. We clicked instantly, met in person a few months later, and I wish I could say the rest was history. We‚Äôve known each other for about 2.5 years now and live about 15-20 minutes apart. 

The first year after meeting in person, we hung out at least once a month and it was the kind of friendship where we would go to one of our homes and just talk for hours. Like it would literally be past midnight and we‚Äôd have totally lost track of time. I felt like it was the friendship I had been looking for my entire life. It didn‚Äôt seem like any topics were off limits, and honestly it was my most emotionally intimate relationship. We had fun together, texted basically every day, and everything seemed mutual. 

The next year (this past year), I was hit by depression. It was the most I‚Äôve ever struggled with my mental health in my adult life. I‚Äôm generally not an open person about this kind of thing due to trauma, so I started to isolate myself. She didn‚Äôt really reach out, and I would just return to our text convo after several days or weeks and things would continue like normal. 

I realized I really needed support and decided to try to be more direct - another thing I struggle with, but am really working on in therapy and my relationships in general. I texted her and told her that I was struggling with my mental health, needed support, and felt like I wasn‚Äôt worthy of friendship at that point. She replied and said she hadn‚Äôt experienced that herself, and that her female friendships are all about talking and support. I also said that I felt like I just needed someone to show up for me, and she said that everybody is busy with their own lives and wants support for themselves, and maybe I should ask someone else (my husband specifically, which is kind of obvious advice and I think your support circle should consist of more than just your spouse). It broke me. I had put so much effort into being vulnerable and reaching out to a trusted person for support, and felt like she proved exactly what I told her I was worried about (that I wasn‚Äôt worthy of friendship or support). 

I went into a pretty extreme depression after that and even relapsed with an addiction that I had been clean from for over a decade. Anyways, this past year I‚Äôve felt like she‚Äôs been totally uninterested in hanging out or having any kind of deep friendship. We saw each other maybe 5 times last year, and most of them were quick hangouts at a coffee shop. Nothing like our 8+ hour convos from the year before. I tried to initiate many many other hangouts and kept getting the ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to check my schedule.‚Äù Which is totally fair, but then check your schedule and let me know if you‚Äôre available, right? She also seemed cagey about spending time with other friends, often telling me she was just taking time for herself, or alluding that she was hanging out with her husband, just for me to see photos of her hanging out with other people on social media. 

She just had two weeks off of work for the holidays and said she didn‚Äôt have a whole lot going on. I asked if she wanted to hang out and she said she would check her schedule. Those two weeks have come and gone and although we‚Äôve texted a bit, she never got back to me about hanging out. Also for context, she runs several errands multiple times a month that are literally within 3 minutes driving distance of my home, and I‚Äôm 5 minutes away from her home at least once a week. 

If you‚Äôre still reading, thank you üôèüèª what do you think is going on here? Am I asking for too much out of my friendship? Is it unrealistic to hope a friend like this would be receptive to my ask for support, or even just send me a text saying like hey I know you‚Äôve been struggling, is there anything I can do?

Sometimes I think she just wanted a friend who was happy and easy to be around, and isn‚Äôt interested in being there when I‚Äôm struggling. I also feel like I was the shiny new friend for a while, and then became uninteresting and she moved on. I‚Äôve asked if she‚Äôs had stuff going on, wanted to talk about anything, etc. and it‚Äôs usually just been that she‚Äôs busy (work, gym, groceries, pets, etc) and burnt out. But she has not communicated that she doesn‚Äôt have the capacity or bandwidth for me right now. It‚Äôs just so hard to feel like I‚Äôve lost my friend on top of everything else I‚Äôve been dealing with, but I can‚Äôt keep pouring into people who won‚Äôt pour into me. I‚Äôm just wondering if there‚Äôs another perspective that I haven‚Äôt considered. There‚Äôs a lot more I could say, but this is already a novel, so I won‚Äôt. Thank you all! 

TLDR: I had a great friendship with someone who seemed emotionally open and receptive. I started hardcore struggling with depression and felt her pull away. I‚Äôm not sure what to do. Are my hopes for my friendship unrealistic? Is something else going on? ",4,1736306114.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I'm realizing I use the equivalent of a 6-cup pot, but I now also have two 3-cups as a result. I wanted to know if it would be smarter to sell the second 3-cup and buy a 6-cup, or use both 3-cups to make 6 cups worth of coffee?

1hwa0sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CWxGAMES/comments/1hwa0sg/tifu_by_going_into_my_parents_basement_while/,TIFU by going into my parents basement while house sitting,"Today, I fucked up while house-sitting for my parents.¬†



I'm a 26-year-old male. A few weeks ago, my parents asked me for a favor. They were planning an extended trip upstate and needed someone to look after their home and care for Brosco, their beloved German shepherd. Since I had ample vacation time, I gladly accepted the responsibility, excited to spend time with my childhood pet.



However, on the day they left, I was working a long shift and couldn't be there to see them off. They had packed their bags the night before, so I knew they were ready to go, but it felt strange not to be there to wave goodbye. They were set to leave in the early morning, and I planned to head over to their place as soon as work was done.



Once I finally clocked out, I rushed to their House, eager to reunite with Brosco and settle in. I let myself in with the spare key they'd given me. I was immediately greeted by the rhythmic thumping of Brosco's tail against the floor. He looked thrilled to see me, his big brown eyes excitedly shining.



While settling in, I realized I had not been given clear instructions on the House's security system. After some fumbling, I figured it out and locked it up properly.



Brosco and I had a fantastic first night together, filled with laughter and good vibes. We settled in for a movie marathon, the dim glow of the screen flickering softly in the darkened room as we munched on popcorn and indulged in our favorite snacks. Time slipped away, and before I knew it, the clock crept past 4 a.m. I finally succumbed to sleep, feeling warm and content.



Suddenly, a loud, thunderous bang echoed from the basement door, slicing through the tranquility of the night and jolting me awake. My heart raced as I glanced at the spot where Brosco had been sprawled beside me. To my dismay, he was gone. I threw off the covers and slowly climbed out of bed, the cool air shattering my spine.¬†



As I crept toward the open bedroom door leading into the dimly lit hallway, I saw Brosco standing at the top of the stairs, his silhouette outlined against the faint light. He looked down intently, his ears perked up, waiting in a stillness that made my apprehension grow. What could be lurking in the shadows below?



I nestled next to my furry companion, peering into the thick shroud of darkness that enveloped the stairs. The silence weighed heavily in the air, a suffocating blanket that strained my ears for any hint of sound.¬†



It felt like time had slowed to a crawl, each second stretching longer than the last. With deliberate care, I descended the creaky stairs, moving as quietly as possible. The hushed atmosphere amplified every faint creak beneath my feet. Finally, I reached the bottom, greeted by the dim glow of the moon filtering through a small window, casting eerie shadows across the space.



To my left, a short hall branched off, leading to a den that loomed like a shadowy secret, while directly ahead loomed the ominous basement door. To my right lay the kitchen, a familiar sanctuary now cloaked in uncertainty. I ventured into the kitchen, my heart racing, keeping my gaze fixed down the hallway, alert to any spur of movement. With a swift motion, I snatched a knife from the countertop, its cold steel a comforting weight in my hand, ready to protect myself against whatever may lurk in the darkness.



With the knife in my hand, As I approached the basement door, my heart quickened, and the cool air seemed to grow heavier around me. I reached out with my empty hand, fingers brushing the surface of the knob, the metal cool against my skin. With a deliberate motion, I slowly turned the handle, anticipation building with each passing moment.¬†



But to my dismay, it wouldn't budge; it was locked tight.¬†



I leaned closer, inspecting the knob with a furrowed brow. It had been installed backward, a puzzling design choice that allowed it to be locked from the inside. A deadbolt accompanied it, equally secured, hinting at a more profound secret lying just beyond the door, sealed away from the world.



Why did my parents install the basement door so perplexingly? After a while, the House settled into a deep silence, and gradually, sleep crept in, wrapping around me like a warm blanket. I decided to surrender to the drowsiness, hoping that by the time the sun arose, I would have the energy and clarity to search for a key or some clever way to unlock the basement and uncover its mysteries.



As the sun began peering through the curtains, casting soft rays into my room, I reached for my phone and dialed my mother's number. The ringing echoed in the silence, each tone stretching into the next, creating an almost endless rhythm. I listened intently, hoping for her familiar voice to break through, but the call was silent; she didn't answer. Perhaps she was lost in the joy of a getaway with my father, savoring their moments away from the daily grind.¬†



I left a voice mail: "" Hey, Mom, it's me. I wanted to check in and see how you were enjoying the trip. Love you, Bye.""



Yet, as I lay there, a lingering unease from the previous night crept back into my mind. The unsettling noise resonated in the stillness, and the heavy weight of the locked basement door haunted my thoughts. It was as if the air around me was thick with questions, and shadows of doubt lingered beyond my vision.



I slowly slid out of bed, the soft morning light spilling through the curtains and casting a warm glow across the room. With a gentle stretch, I glanced down at Brosco, my loyal companion, who was nestled at the foot of the bed. His ears perked up as I moved, and soon, he trotted beside me as I made my way downstairs to the kitchen.



The scent of freshly brewed coffee and the promise of breakfast filled the air. I reached for the skillet, letting the stove's warmth envelop me as I cracked some eggs into the pan. Brosco, ever watchful, settled on the floor beside me, his gaze fixed intently on the basement door. I couldn‚Äôt shake the sense of unease it brought me. The heavy, old door was odd, secured with a sturdy deadbolt lock. Who knew what lay behind it?



As I finished my breakfast, unease simmered just beneath the surface. I thought a change of scenery might help clear my mind, so I grabbed Brosco‚Äôs leash and headed outside for a walk together. The crisp, invigorating, and fresh air greeted us. We strolled down the quiet street, my thoughts drifting from the locked door to the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves. I hoped that the rhythm of our steps would ease the tension that had settled around me.



The gentle breeze filled my lungs, momentarily lifting the weight of my anxious thoughts. I noticed something unexpected as we curved around my parents' home's long, winding driveway. The door on the side of the House, which led directly into the cozy kitchen, stood slightly open, swinging gently in the wind. A sense of unease washed over me as I recalled closing and locking that door moments before we left. The familiar sounds of the outside world faded as a knot formed in my stomach, urging me to investigate the unsettling sight.



I carefully ascended each weathered step of the side porch, the creaking wood beneath my feet echoing in the quiet of the evening. As I reached the top, I extended my hand toward the door, grasping the cool metal handle to halt its swinging in the wind. Taking a moment to catch my breath, I scanned the surroundings, my heart racing slightly as I searched for any evidence of recent activity‚Äîfootprints, a snapped twig, or any other sign that someone might have been here before me. The fading light cast long shadows across the ground, heightening my vigilance as I listened for any sounds that might indicate I was not alone.



Brosco burst into the House like a whirlwind, yanking the leash from my fingers with surprising strength. His fur bristled, and a low growl rumbled in his throat as he barked ferociously, a clear sign that something had chafed at his instincts. He raced through the kitchen, his paws skidding on the tile, echoing through the quiet space as he veered sharply and dashed toward the hallway. The door leading to the basement loomed ahead, slightly ajar, as if beckoning him to uncover whatever danger lurked beyond. I stood frozen, half in awe and half alarmed, as the edge of the door creaked wider, revealing shadows that seemed to shift restlessly.



He darted into the depths of the darkness, the sound of the barking abruptly silencing with a sudden, sharp yelp that echoed eerily through the House. A chill ran down my spine as I felt the weight of the silence that followed. Heart racing, I hurried into the House, the familiar creak of the wooden floorboards beneath my feet loud in the stillness. I approached the basement door, my pulse quickening with each step. Grasping the doorknob, I hesitated momentarily, absorbing the darkness that loomed beyond. Taking a deep breath, I pulled the door open entirely and descended the creaking stairs; my senses heightened as I plunged into the inky blackness after Brosco, hoping to find him before it was too late.



As I reached the landing, a wave of icy darkness enveloped me, leaving me momentarily paralyzed. My eyes strained to adjust, but the blackness swallowed all light, creating an impenetrable void. An unsettling sense of fear slithered through my mind, urging me to move, yet I stood frozen, my heart pounding. I strained to listen in the silence, allowing any sound to pierce the stillness around me.



Then, I faintly discerned Brosco's whimper echoing softly in the depths of the darkness‚Äîan almost ghostly sound that heightened my anxiety. I steadied my breath and cautiously began to inch forward, each movement deliberate. My feet slid along the ground as I sought to connect with something solid. I soon felt the incredible, rough texture of the wall against my fingertips, which provided a small measure of comfort amid the encroaching dread.



As I continued to probe the surface, my hand brushed against something that felt out of place‚Äîa switch. A flicker of hope ignited within me, and with a trembling finger, I reached for it, anticipation swirling as I prepared to bring some light into this suffocating darkness.



The light-flooded everything around me, overwhelming my senses and rendering me momentarily blind. Each ray felt sharp as it pierced through the remnants of pure darkness, causing my eyes to sting and water. I instinctively rubbed them, hoping to clear the haze. Still, the brightness only intensified, a blinding glare against the backdrop of my disorientation.¬†



An overpowering stench assaulted my nostrils as I struggled to adjust, cutting through the confusion. It was a foul, acrid odor that seemed to cling to the air, reminiscent of something rotten and decayed. The stark light and the noxious smell made my stomach churn, intensifying my unease as I fought to make sense of my surroundings.



A surprising scene unfolded as my eyes gradually adapted to the light flooding the basement. A towering stack of my parents‚Äô luggage stood in the far corner. The familiar, weathered suitcases were scattered haphazardly, striking me with a jolt‚Äîmy parents had never actually departed for their long-planned trip upstate. The realization sank like a weight in my chest, filling the air with an unshakable sense of unease.¬†



The ground and scattered luggage were coated in a dark red, dried substance. It appeared thick and crusty, like dried blood.



Brosco was intently pawing at one of the significant, weathered cases stacked in the corner of the room. His curiosity seemed to drive him as he sniffed and nudged the zippers with his nose. I approached cautiously, my heart racing with anticipation, and reached to grasp the worn rusted zipper. I took a deep breath and began to unzip it slowly, savoring the moment. Suddenly, without warning, something unexpectedly heavy and round‚Äîabout the size of a bowling ball‚Äîcame tumbling out, hitting the floor with a dull thud and rolling ominously away from the case.



As I stood there, my gaze instinctively tracked the path of an ominous object that had tumbled out of the dark recesses of the back area. When my eyes landed on my mother's expressionless face, a chill ran down my spine. Her stare was vacant and lifeless, devoid of any recognition or warmth. Then, the foul stench enveloped me, thick and nauseating, filling the air like a heavy fog. The putrid odor clawed at my throat, and before I could even brace myself, I doubled over. I vomited, the contents of my stomach spilling forth uncontrollably. Panic surged within me as I stumbled backward, my heart racing. I darted up the narrow staircase, the dread propelling me forward with urgency, my fingers fumbling in search of my phone buried deep in my pocket, desperate to escape this horror and reach out for help.



As I reached the basement door at the top of the stairs, I held my phone and dialed 911.¬†



""911, what's the emergency?"" A calm voice came through, sharply contrasting with the turmoil inside me.



After further investigation, it was revealed that the bodies had been lying hidden in that grim, secluded location for several days, far longer than anyone had initially suspected. The unsettling truth was that the perpetrator had likely remained in the House, lurking in the shadows of the basement, until I took Brosco out for our usual walk that fateful day as the feeling that something sinister had unfolded in my parent's home. At the same time, I was blissfully unaware while house-sitting.¬†



So Today, I fucked up by going into my parent's Basement while house-sitting.

6. I think Felicia was a Dior poison girl.
7. I don‚Äôt really understand Dave‚Äôs income situation, so he got some fresh ginger perfumes with a bit of aromatic notes that are not hella expensive, but still good.

8. I think Paul would go for something citrus and woody. They would be a great much with Mary Alice.
9. No comments.
10. I think Rex would stick to a few good woody all notes together strong farangaces.
11. Carlos was a man of feelings and finding true love (each time when he would have a sympathy for someone it was a true life ü§´ u just don‚Äôt get it), that‚Äôs why this man would go for some flowery woody strong notes.
12. George would sit all days on TikTok watching tips about how to attract a female, he would find some male aka Andrew Tate child that would sell him pheromones to attract Bree. He would also get some lux woody perfume to give off Rex vibes (but he had no money for niche, so man had to get Armani and use it each time when he sees Bree above his masculine pheromone perfumes ).

ANY help?,"On March 6th, 2024, I visited a chiropractor for chronic neck and shoulder pain. During the session, he aggressively pressed down on my head while I was seated, performing a neck-compression test. To be clear, he had both his hands over the top of my head, as I was in a seated position, and pushed in forcefully and suddenly.

Since then, I‚Äôve experienced ongoing extreme discomfort, including lightheadedness, faintness, paresthesia in my left ring and pinky fingers, head pressure, dizziness, and fatigue. The first couple months were so severe I had multiple ER visits and innumerable doctor's visits. Ten months later, I don't get the lightheadedness or faintness anymore, but my symptoms persist, though less intense. I still experience lightness, tingling in my left fingers and head, head discomfort and heaviness, and episodes of overwhelming unsteadiness, where I feel a rush of energy in my head and in my body, which I call ‚Äúwaves‚Äù or ‚Äúrushes,‚Äù that I have to wait out.

I‚Äôve had extensive tests‚ÄîCervical MRI, Brain MRI, CT scans, blood work, and heart tests‚Äîall showing nothing abnormal. Despite seeing multiple doctors, no one has a clear explanation. My daily life has been significantly impacted, and I can no longer exercise, drink coffee, and, many other things.

I'm sorry this is so long. Any suggestions on how to improve would be immensely appreciated, as this has been a difficult struggle for the past 10 months.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Thank you, and God bless.",2,1736305665.0,cervical_vertigo,0,1.0,False

This happens every morning. I wake up and the whole downstairs stinks like cat feces and piss so I have to get to scrubbing before I‚Äôve even had my cup of coffee. The kids are crying while this is going on.

We‚Äôve tried everything. Moving the litter box, changing the litter box, adding another litter box, changing the litter, throwing away the door mats I bought he repeatedly pees and poops on, and we took him to the vet that cost us $2,000 only for them to say ‚Äútry this expensive cat food diet.‚Äù NOTHING HAS WORKED.

It‚Äôs been years of this, and now that I have two young children, I‚Äôm fed up and want this cat gone. I‚Äôm the one cleaning up after him every day, not my husband because he‚Äôs away for work for a whole year. Not to mention, this cat meows in the middle of the night and wakes up the babies all the time. I‚Äôm sick of picking up cat piss and shit every day when I don‚Äôt even have time to eat for myself! I‚Äôm 4 months postpartum and I‚Äôve lost so much weight in such a short time due to not eating.

He refuses to find a new home for this cat, and I just want to scream. No matter how much I‚Äôm struggling, he doesn‚Äôt care. He doesn‚Äôt care the kids grow up in filth, he doesn‚Äôt care I‚Äôm spending valuable time picking up feces, he doesn‚Äôt care that our house smells. He just thinks I‚Äôm a terrible person for wanting to get rid of the cat for my sanity, and it‚Äôs making me contemplate divorce. I never want a pet again, especially after kids. 

I just want a space my kids can grow, crawl, and walk around without the fear of stepping in animal poop all the time. I‚Äôm embarrassed of my own home.",16,1736305626.0,breakingmom,20,0.94,False

Both her and I are the type of people who love to walk all day and discover hidden alleys, wake up early to catch the sunrise and staying a little late to explore the night life. We aren't going to Thailand to explore the party life but more the culture side of things as I myself am a photographer and want to come back with stunning photos of temples and beautiful landscapes.

What do you guys think of this Itinerary, are there other locations you would recommend? Could we combine multiple locations on the same day? Is the remaining 8 days enough to visit the south side of the country like Krabi, Khao Sok National Park, Phuket or Phi Phi?

A little bit about me and then my criteria/wants/needs.

So basically I'm trying to do better with scheduling my life and my kids lives in this post-divorce world that I'm now inhabitating. 

Digital calendars have failed to work for me outside of actual occupation related tasks, which is crazy to me since I work in IT and am quite tech savvy.  But here I am. 

My current system is basically a huge (think small coffee table or big end table sized) wall calendar that I use to track EVERYTHING  of note from upcoming doc appointments for me or kiddos to recitals to baseball games to travel plans to local events of note. Oh and the parenting swap schedule of course which is a 5 2 2 5 plan that is working great for all parties involved. 

My need is to have that calendar mirrored in a portable format such that when someone says ""want to do coffee at 11am next Tuesday?"" I can answe with relevant facts and availability and expected kiddo status instead of falling back to my curret response of ""I'll need to check my calendar when I get home"".  Note that taking a photo of the wall calendar is not a solution that works. 

Also, my usage would be solid and reliable on keeping these things in sync.  I'd be very on top of keeping screwups to a minimum. 

Oh and I may use a fountain pen, I'm a fan, with this setup but a nicer ball point or drawing pen may also be what I go with. TBD. 

So, after a deep dive into Japanese planner culture and terminology I've come out with the following criteria / wants. 

1) Mnthly view required. Some extra space may be nice but Im NOT journaling or doing hardcore crafts here 
2) Sunday start ideal and maybe even required since I'm coordinating two data repos here
3) Lined squares (or grid perhaps )within each day in month view is big.  A empty box doesn't let me list/sequence days that have 3 or 4 items and that data flow/visual is crucial when juggling kid events. 
4) Dated is required
5) A sturdy build is great as I may jot things down in the car or on the fly
6)  More portable is better but I dont need pocket size since this will be car/backpack and not on my person 24/7, lie flat is good too


TL:DR -
My closest hit was the PAPERAGE 2 YEAR spiral bound planner I saw on Amazon.  I wish it had more lines per day and that it was more lux or less cheap oddly but, unless you all advise otherwise, I cant complain.

I have made a critical error. Like‚Ä¶ felony-level error. If the precinct finds out, I‚Äôll be packing up my frosting bags and trading my badge for a hairnet at the local bakery.

It all started this morning. It was quiet‚Äîtoo quiet. No car chases, no shoplifters, not even a rogue raccoon stuck in a vending machine. So, naturally, I thought, Why not use this downtime productively?

By ‚Äúproductively,‚Äù I mean editing my ‚ÄúSinfully Sweet: Triple-Drizzle Edition‚Äù video.

I slipped my camera‚Äôs SD card into the department computer, careful to keep the window minimized in case Captain Murphy waddled by. I was halfway through cutting the part where I whispered, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs ready for a sticky situation?‚Äù when I realized I needed coffee. Editing seductive pastry videos requires caffeine, Diary‚Äîit‚Äôs the law.

But that‚Äôs when it happened.

While I was away, Sgt. Daniels came through on his usual dash-cam collection sweep, grabbed the stack of SD cards off my desk‚Äîincluding mine‚Äîand marched straight to the review room.

I didn‚Äôt even notice it was gone until I sat back down, took one sip of my coffee, and saw the ‚ÄúNO DEVICE DETECTED‚Äù error. My stomach dropped faster than a microwaved Pop-Tart.

Diary, you don‚Äôt understand‚Äîmy entire library of frosting footage is on that card. Every drizzle. Every moan. Every ‚ÄúOh yeah, just like that.‚Äù And now it‚Äôs sitting in the evidence room, ready to be reviewed by a department that thinks ‚Äúsprinkles‚Äù is gang slang.

I tried to play it cool. I casually asked Daniels, ‚ÄúHey, uh, did you grab any‚Äîother‚ÄîSD cards?‚Äù

He squinted at me and said, ‚ÄúYou mean the one labeled ‚ÄòHOT STRUDEL ACTION‚Äô?‚Äù

I blacked out for three seconds. When I came to, I said something about needing it for an undercover pastry sting operation and then sprinted to the bathroom to cry.

I have two options now:

1.	Confess to Captain Murphy and hope he‚Äôs secretly a fan.

2.	Break into the evidence room, Mission Impossible-style, and swap the cards. 

Either way, I need to make peace with the fact that someone‚Äîpossibly the entire precinct‚Äîis about to see me deep-throat an icing packet.

Pray for me, Diary. Or better yet, find me a lawyer who specializes in pastry-related scandals.

I keep seeing people post about their loneliness or having difficulties finding friends in Japan. The comments are often ""go to meet ups or do a pottery class"", but I think this kind of problem deserves a longer answer. So I wrote down my two cents this morning.

I hope you're all doing good.¬†

Finding real friends can be as hard as finding a romantic partner in my opinion.

It‚Äôs easy to have a coffee with almost anyone and have a decent time, but that doesn‚Äôt make it a friendship. Friendship, to me, goes much deeper and it starts with myself.

I think to be a good friend or partner is to really know yourself. For me, that took work. I had to look at parts of myself that I didn‚Äôt necessarily like and learn to accept them and embrace the parts of me that I like.¬†

One big thing I realized was that many of the things I loved as a kid weren‚Äôt just phases. They were things I‚Äôm still deeply fascinated by and reconnecting with those hobbies and interests helped me feel more comfortable with myself.¬†

That lead me to be okay with being alone. In the past I went to meetups hoping to make connections, but I‚Äôd often leave feeling even lonelier. It felt like no one really knew what they were looking for‚Äîlike the blind leading the blind. Eventually, I started to enjoy being by myself.¬†

In my opinion, being alone isn‚Äôt a bad thing. It gave me time to do things I love and learn more about myself, leading me to new interests.¬†

I also learned that it is very crucial being open about what I enjoy to others. Whether it‚Äôs on social media, chatting with coworkers, or talking to new people, sharing my interest is the best and probably most straightforward way to find actual friends. All the people I now call close friends came into my life through shared interests.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about how hard it is to make friends in Japan, but I think this isn‚Äôt just a Japan problem. It is hard everywhere. But if you take the time to know yourself, enjoy your own company, and share the things you‚Äôre passionate about, you‚Äôre much more likely to find the kind of people that will matter to you.

My rotation, not interested in churning, and I collect both points and cash back 

**1. Rogers WE** \- 3% cash back on everything when applied to phone bill (including Costco, and when combined with Exec membership Costco cash back increases to 5%), 3% cash back on USD online shopping

**2. Canadian Tire Triangle WE** \- 1% in CT money on bill payments that typically don't accept credit cards (like utilities), plus free roadside assistance

**3. AMEX Cobalt** \- 5x points or \~5% cash back when redeemed for statement balance on eating out, use this for all coffee/restaurant expenses

**4. Scotiabank Visa Infinite** \- 4% cash back on groceries and recurring bills (max out the Rogers WE cash back benefit against phone bill so needed a secondary grocery card, plus 1% higher cash back on non-Costco grocery)

How can I talk to him?,"I (25F) have been dating a guy (26M) I've met on Hinge for 2 months. He asked me to be his girlfriend 2 weeks ago and I said yes because I enjoy spending time with him and I appreciate that he takes things slowly with me in terms of intimacy (I've never been in a relationship before). A week ago, I planned a date for us to visit a local coffee shop to spend time together because we haven't seen each other in person for a while (both busy with grad school). I asked him in advance if he would like to do that but it was okay if he was busy. He said he would absolutely be there and that he missed me.  
  
When we were supposed to meet that day, I got a text from him that he wanted to reschedule the date to another day because he had a paper to write for a class (the due date was not that day) 30 minutes before we were supposed to meet. I was genuinely upset because the week before, I similarly had a deadline for a class but finished my assignment early to spend time with him and his friends. I texted him that this hurt me and made me feel uncomfortable, and said that I would rather talk about this in person so we don't run into this issue again.  
  
He apologized over text and said he would rather have this conversation face to face too but did not initiate anything to do that and just continued to text me about his day as if nothing happened. He has been rescheduling dates, promising that he would ""make it up to me"" and not following through those ever since.  
  
When we met in person (I finally caved in and asked to meet for coffee again), I talked about how his behavior made me feel insecure and he apologized again but quickly changed the subject. I feel like I'm putting more energy and time into this relationship than him and even though he was the one who wanted to make things ""official"", his inconsistent behavior confuses me and makes me sad. I felt so distant towards him when we last met and I'm having doubts about moving forward with this relationship.

Of course, over coffee I catch him in a lie which turns out to be that he slept with someone two days prior, in the same day he slept with me. Instead of arguing this time, I just left. He was asking me not to go, saying  ‚Äúit was no big deal‚Äù, telling me everything would be fine if I could just be ‚Äúchill‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, I just left.

I fucking want him to show up right now and tell me it was a huge mistake and he wants to make things work between us. But I know he won‚Äôt. The pain comes from accepting that he never really wanted to be with me, and now he gets to live the life was always holding him back from. He can fuck whoever he wants and date whoever he wants and I won‚Äôt be in the way to make him feel guilty. He always said I was trying to control him, I guess I was hoping to show him that there is more to life than making sex with strangers your number one focus in life. Everyone was right, I have to let him live his own life. And when he doesn‚Äôt show up again, and when another week goes by where I don‚Äôt have the strength to call, I guess I‚Äôll just have to accept that it‚Äôs really over.

I had to move back into my parents house due to quitting a job that was very bad. I tried to explain to a friend that I want to be moved out in 2 months so I can continue going low contact.

However, they basically say it‚Äôs odd and weird to not want to stay with my parents and save up money. And that I seem rude and self centered for coming home and then just go low contact after I leave. 

They still think it‚Äôs good to have a plan to be independent but they think I‚Äôm being crazy about leaving my parents. And I just can‚Äôt ever really explain why I don‚Äôt like them because I know if I explain my past I‚Äôll either be trauma dumping, or they‚Äôll literally never believe me and assume I‚Äôm dramatizing/imagining my past.

But then again if I told someone my mom was selling me out, that‚Äôs a pretty wild story that most people would NOT believe. 

I literally keep running into this wall where no one understands how awful my parents are. I hate when people just tell me ‚ÄúI get that your situation is hard, but maybe your being to hard on yourself and your parents.‚Äù

(Okay?, I'm literally just ordering black coffee)

I usually order the same thing, but sometimes i do have variants of coffee i decide to choose from, but its usually black coffee.

I asked her for a blank black coffee, and while preparing it, she asked for my name. She mentioned that she sees me often, ordering the same thing, yet I always seem unsure....

In my head, I was like WTF, why would she feel comfortable saying that to me, I'm not fat, short, I was wearing a gym tank top that showcased my broad shoulders.... How dare she say something like that to me... the nerve of her... (my ego)

I responded jokily, and told her i have anxiety, and not everyone is built the same. She told me to practice. She used her body language to demonstrate speaking with more assertion.

Its just so fucking weird that someone would point that out to me....

I told her i appreciate it, and i left. All the while i was very upset.

I felt offended by her remarks, as they hit my self-esteem, despite my efforts to improve my social skills. As a man with Asperger's, I often face assumptions about my confidence and abilities. Her comment made me feel inadequate, especially since men are expected to be assertive. I wish people would stop making quick judgments based on limited interactions.

Do women make backhanded compliments as a way to flirt? She had no right to criticize how I communicated my order. Luckily, she criticized me when it was slow, with no other patrons inside witness the interaction. She said it in a friendly way... like she was trying to dominate me. I

Today, i seen her, and she asked me about how my day was trying to make small talk. I just usually respond with one word answers. Small talk isn't my strongest skill lol

I don't know how to interpret this interaction. I'm quite confused, and humiliated by her critique of my social skills. As if im not adequate enough, as if i had lost a physical fight.

TLDR: Barista made a comment about my social skills, alluding that I should sound more assertive when ordering coffee. Not sure if it's flirting or a backhanded compliment; either way, I feel like my manhood has been disrespected.",2,1736302645.0,intj,20,0.67,False
