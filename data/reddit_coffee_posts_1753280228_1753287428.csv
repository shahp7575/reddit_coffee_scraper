As a dumbphone user since 2022, I feel it’s important for us to voice concern when public services require a smartphone. Many examples have been shared here where smartphone apps are required, like purchasing public transit tickets, school IDs, ordering coffee at physical shops, mandatory e-tickets for events - even a laundromat that required an app.

Like i am not talking about simply being tired like i would assume most people would be - i am talking barely functioning at all which can last for hours right into the early afternoon.

I start work at 0730 so I am up at around 6am or shortly after and most of my jobs have been in and around this time frame. But no matter how early i go to bed (or late) 99% of the time is the same feeling.

I actually got fed up a few weeks back and went to my doctor for blood tests and even demanded a testosterone check (i'm 40) - all came back normal which was a surprise because i few years back i had to go on folic acid tablets and was told then i also had low b12.  

even throughout the day i am constantly yawning which was also playing on my mind - like this can't be normal to yawn this much - like easily a burst of yawns every hour or two............then i wonder is it my job as a lorry driver? unless you drive for a living you wouldn't understand the mental drain it is.

anyway, i just want to know if there are anymore people out there who genuinely struggle to get out of second gear in the mornings - even after a coffee or two or am i overthinking this and it's quiet normal? ",2,1753287096.0,northernireland,2,1.0,False
1m7dg90,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortugalExpats/comments/1m7dg90/reccomendations_for_central_tejo_area/,Reccomendations for central Tejo area,"Hi all, have been living here for just over a year now with my wife who is Portuguese and thought I'd share some tips that might be good for ex-pats around this area. A lot of this stuff are things we have found by asking around and getting to know people and a lot of it are things I wish I knew when I moved here, so hopefully this is helpful!

**Co-Working Spaces**

This one was huge for me, I hate working at home alone and had to do it for 6 months before I found places. There are loads in the big cities but much harder to find in the central Tejo area. 

My two favorites are:

SuMação in Mação: Between the cities of Abrantes and Castelo Branco, really nice atmosphere with good coffee and food. They do day rates and monthly rates. Lots of nice river beaches near by. 

Gloria Coworking in Tomar: Beautiful and airy, right next to the centre with good coffee shops near by. Tomar is a lovely little city with a great markets on weekends!

**Running Shops**

I love running and was worried at first that I would always have to buy online or from decathlon. I've since found these two cool shops:

Training Store Abrantes: Small but good collection of real trail running brands like Hoka, the owner is super nice and speaks good english, she helped me pick a good pair of shoes for me.

Runextrem in Almerim: This is a small but incredible little shop that's like a trail runners heaven, full of everything you need.

**Markets**

Tomar - Fridays:   
Good collection of food, old trinkets and furniture  
  
Mouriscas - Sundays:   
Loads of local produce from the area and easily the best street piri piri chicken I've had round here!

Estremoz - Saturdays:  
A bit of a drive if you live near the tejo like I do but really worth it for furniture and interesting finds.

Realise this is quite the electic mix but hopefully people find it useful!

1m7dg7g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m7dg7g,Reconciliation/Communication Ritual + Sweetening Jar,"So this morning I did my first Reconciliation + Communication Spell and a Sweetening jar.

Reconciliation + Communication: 

White candle and Yellow candle (Communication)
Small jar
Orange Peel
Rose Bud
Instant Coffee
Lavender
salt
Red Chili flakes
Nutmeg
Taglocks
Personalized Petition
Crystals you feel drawn too
Fire proof bowl
Lighter
Incense

First I cleansed with a vanilla incense and grounded myself, because this is a reconciliation between an SP and I—For grounding myself I played a spell playlist I made and sat quietly singing along to the songs for meditation. 

Once grounded I carved my name and his name + d.o.b. On the white candle along with the phrases “All is forgiven” and “Open road to love”. On the yellow candle I carved my sigil for open communication. I then anointed both of those candles with a protection oil I made as well as nutmeg.

In the jar, I did my tag lock and his (I had his name and sweet sentiments cut out from letters I’ve gotten from him in his handwriting), Lavender, rosebuds, orange peels, salt, instant coffee(because I want this to work rather quickly), red chili flakes( for a spicy sex life between us), along with a personal petition written in red ink (His tag lock folded in the petition towards me as many times as I could fold)

While that sat to the side, I set up the candles side by side in a fire proof bowl, and the crystals I felt drawn to: Rose Quartz, amethyst, and a regular quartz. While lighting the candles I recited

""Any and all things preventing a reconciliation between X and X are cleared from our path. All is forgiven between X and X. The road to love between X and X is open."" (I got from another spell while researching and I liked it, so I incorporated it)
When done reciting, I used some of the wax from the candles to seal my jar.


Sweetening Jar: 

Sugar
Instant Coffee
Rose bud
Nutmeg
White Willow
Dragons Blood Resin
Sweet Oil
Tag Lock
Personalized Petition
Red candle
Small Vile
Incense



I started by cleansing the vile jar with a rose incense, again grounding myself to a playlist of some of the songs we’ve listened to before.

In the jar I started with Sugar, instant coffee, Rose buds, nutmeg, white willow, petition with his tag lock folded three times towards me, my tag lock, and sweet oil to top off everything. I then carved sigil for sweet thoughts on the candle and anointed with sweet oil and nutmeg.

I closed the jar, and sat listening to the music while thinking of some of the times he was the sweetest to me while holding the jar. Once I was done, I closed it and place the red candle on top lighting it and letting burn until it was done. 

I said my goodbyes and thank you and grounded with meditation and a quick tarot pull. 



From this, I have had a major confidence boost and this tingly feeling on the spots he’s kissed on my neck before. It’s like they’re radiating 😂 





For the tarot pull, I thought the cards were interesting and really confirmed that it pulled on those energy cords between us. We’ve been no contact for about 3 weeks now and I just have this great feeling about these spells. Later this week I plan on doing another layer and trying my hand at a lust spell/obsession spell(I don’t want to hear about the consequences, I’m positive this is what I want and it’s part of my bigger plan.)

I was hoping to hear some of yalls thoughts on the spells and cards that jumped after my work was done. I also found it intriguing on how big the flame was with my sweetening jar, I’m not sure if I’m looking too deep into it, but to me that signifies that it’s a strong jar.

I worked for a janky small business for 5 years , the owners foreign and non existent in this place . They did business dirty , but tried to sweet talk you old Greek guys . I literally didn’t care I was just there to work after being a former sex worker / an abused person for all my life . I was relieved to work somewhere crappy just for the normalcy . I could understand people fighting to get out of there I saw people wanting better for themselves . But I’ll be honest I’m not at all anti union I just knew when to say when when to get another job if I could or just have good boundaries and not tolerate shit I couldn’t trust me it was not a super demanding work place . Anywho . It’s a lot of young people 19-30 rotating but a solid crew who did a little of everything .To give context now : there’s an older guy maybe 52 or 62 I’m unsure , who’s worked there 15 or so years that’s a long time . I truly think he’s a master at the job , sometimes he’s done stuff interpersonally where I’m like wow you could of totally accommodated that guy do the work but whatever the point is he knew how to do his job but like as a manager horrific . He really would pass off my questions to the office which ok isn’t that bad but he acted like the king of the castle like he owned the place . He wanted a high level of respect . He hates the owner and makes it known it’s giving : your not my boss I could run this place better . He has great banter with customers he likes and coworkers that like him . He always is in debates which he feels are friendly but often it felt like he always intended to win which dosnt register for me . He grew up in a whole nother part of the country but has live in major city’s it’s just that I’m from here and it shows , he talks about shock topics , pedophilia in the papers and underage sex workers all kind of stuff that I’m not even judging him for I just didn’t want to hear about it at work I felt trapped. From then on working there I didn’t hate the guy I was just like he’s a little weird let me just work that’s all as time went on and event happened where a street kid age 7 came in running around being an angry kid truthfully he was annoyed tried to get the kid to go but quickly he was just pissed said out loud I’m calling the cops I think the scare him he ran to the phone where I was, I put my hand over it knowing this dude was going to call the cops and idk man It just didn’t feel right maybe I wasn’t thinking , you just never know what happens when you call cps he ran over and I kept saying I respect you I respect you please don’t do this it was a little black kid I don’t know . He grabbed my hand / wrist for a minute and yelled I’m the boss here until I dropped it he tried to talk to me about in the basement the next day like he does everyone I asked to speak to him outside with another goofy boy manager tbh , I straight up was like hey I will never do that again I get it but I wish you would of used your words to instruct me if i was not understanding there was no need to touch me he turned the words back on me saying he had the phone first and that he had to do it never apologized and then in time proceeded to tell others he didn’t respect me , that he didn’t do anything wrong , and tell new employees the story even tho I was not telling anyone ! I started not working with him loosing hours eventually I worked with him and I was just trying to make this guy like me I never reported it I thought he would try to get me fired ( I’ve been abused my whole life without reporting idk ) eventually he had a half way apology on his way to lunch saying I know we’ve had issue in the past then as I spoke about it he was like we don’t have to recap it I told him listen I come from a place of abuse it wasn’t ok you did that he was like if I had known I wouldn’t of my bad - like fuck you . I took the half ass apology I truly truly just wanted to work ! From then on I started having my own personal issues and was miserable all the time I had no patience for this man so I stopped talking to him expect about work I said please thank you and I’m sorry I said hey I’m late I’m so sorry or hey I’m early I said hey such and such need you or is there anything to know x y z . But I wouldn’t say hello to him it hurt too much and all the while he still had these intense debates innaprotiate or not with everyone it was just a lot to be around he really needed people to like him to get by . This is work environment where w all work in a small room , just read or go on our phones until customers came him it’s normal when everyone’s 25 it is weird when there’s one 62 year old who’s just sitting there scrolling idk .fast forward : His son works there , a super great motivated young guy younger then me but very anal to be honest really type a personality with no leeway despite me knowing he’s a good guy he’s just far away from certain things in life I felt .About a year ago , the son wanted to unionize and point blank I didnt even know if I did or didn’t want to I just wanted to work and live and not do this thing that could jeporizde my job I did know one thing : this guy , his dad , really did a number on me and I was not comfortable trying to a change a corrupt business I knew would replace me in a second and b advocate for his horrible father .long story short - he bearded me . He didn’t understand how to do community work at all even tho he is an incredible union guy which I can totally respect . It became extreamly uncomfortable for me . I felt like others just went along with it he made it seem like there were no consequences and me being me understanding bad stuff happens in life knew that things would change and that the owner whether he had the money or not had this janky business going at it aggressively and not realistically wasn’t a good idea they went in there asking for things that Starbucks people may or may not even get , like I do believe in rights and having a little bit better pay and repairs and hr but the rest felt so ridiculous and further more them went in there angry and it was too personal all in all with the owner who’s so unbelievably corrupt . It got very tense at work . They just wanted to strike . Despite many people willingly joining the union like 3 people I spoke too didn’t want to actually picket . Maybe 3 on the actual board and one other guy was like yeah guess I’ll do it if the union will pay me to . I feel like only him and son were truly invested and the third really didn’t want to strike but was down the rest didn’t really want to . I feel I was having severe medical problems and just wanted it to go away as crazy as that sounds . Ok now here we go final part :I’m in severe pain emotionally and psychically but need to make money so I finally started going back to work . Day 1 him and his son discussed the espstien thing even a comment made by the dad like : yeah they deny it on the stand but put the kid stuff infront of them watch what happens - I shut off. Then I didn’t work then the following day , I’m there they’re again talking about the Epstein trials . If we were in a bar or coffee shop I swear I wouldn’t judge them . But I’m here trapped in a room and I just can’t take listening to men talk about this . I know all about the abuse I don’t need proof I was practically one of those girls in my own right . Finally I spoke up and said hey can we not talk about this - he got super defensive I noticed it the sarcasm and just said : yeah it’s just it’s a heavy case I just have been hearing alot it’s alot for me it’s not personal he got more intense in my opinion I was trying to de escalate . He goes on a thing asking me about the union and the strike and I got really small . I said I can never say the right thing to you - feeling just defeated he went on a rant about how this is the first thing I’ve said to him a month that I don’t say hi to him . He’s right I Havnt said hi to him but I’ve totally spoken to him. I started shaking and kind of crying I stepped out called the owner finally told him everything fast forward : many people get fired they fire them for staying too late and keeping others clocked in which they were - to a crazy extent if you ask me , a day or two later I get the same letter . Someone clocked me in 18 minutes before a shift once , and the rest I swear to the universe : I clocked out people who accidently didn’t clock out and they never wrote a discrepancy for the office this was such a common practice for all of us I thought nothing of it I didn’t realize it was straight up fraud - I didn’t at all I legit thought I was being helpful I really didn’t know. So I was fired . Before they fired me ; I get an email from the dad / my manager guy , included in it is the owner and union a super fake apology letter also involving me in causing the trouble . The dad still works there they didn’t fire him . This is also a man who harassed a former younger guy who got promoted to manager but young guy was doing way more work and was on call and the older guy despised him it was awful to work around and witness . I was told by my one friend who didn’t get fired , that the reason the older guy sent me that email was basicly so I couldn’t sue something legal but then I was fired so I really couldn’t report him . My dad is kind of crazy and wants to get the owners lawyer involved . I was fired for a legit reason even if it was a dirty fire . I’m very upset I lost my job I totally knew this would happen sometimes you unionize and you win or sometimes you unionize and get fired but this kid just didn’t want to see that . I also feel like this kid isn’t advocating for me at all because he dosnt want his dad fired and that’s so heartbreaking to me and contradicting and fake of him . I’m so heartbroken everyone . I just wanted this guy to maybe be quieter at work , to work upstairs , to have super light banter or just read the room before talking about stuff like that . I feel absolutely singled out . I feel like I spoke up once in my life and this happened. I’m so sad . I feel like I was micro abused at work by a narcissist older bald short guy and no one cares . I can’t sue , what would even happen ? I was fired for unintentional fraud because I’m an idiot . What do I even do . This guy still has his job , he’s been in papers online customers love him he’s been seen smiling innocently on local papers promoting the union . It feels like I’m crazy . I wish non of this ever happens I don’t even think I want revenge I want accountability. I’m so sad . And I don’t have my work anymore that really helped me . Any advice is helpful all I’ve considered was writing an article and having the truth be told. I don’t want to be a victim I want to be honest about myself as well . I just know , this guy got away with being a total jerk to a point where it absolutely damaged my mental health and I’m very distraught over it . The owners won’t fire him at all .

So, there's a girl in my coaching. Haven't interacted with her till now. Classes began approx 20 days back. I usually sit in the front row and she on the back side, once when I was moving out from my position to return home, I noticed a young lady checking me out. She is pretty no cap. Another day, while walking out of the classroom I waited for her and matched her pace and hoped to initiate a conversation with her but couldn't muster up the courage and diverted my way. Yet, another day we had an accidental eye contact during the class. I have been thinking of asking her out for a coffee date since then but since then she has been consecutively absent for 2 days. Today, she came but after the class she was walking in a fast pace to her pg and while I mustered up all the courage I could but I couldn't do it.

I have decided that tomorrow's going to be that day. Either, I am going to arrive little late tomorrow, expecting to sit in her vicinity to strike a conversation and if that's not how things work out then I will ask her out post class (obviously, if she comes tomorrow 😅).

I have decided to ask her in this following manner
""Introduing myself, asking about her, little bit talk about coaching and accademics and then ""Hey, I was wondering, whether you would care to join me for a cup of coffee on one of those fine days..

“All you have to do is reject her,” hearing those words leave her mouth had me freezing in my tracks.

I carefully made my way back to the balcony and hid behind a pillar so she wouldn’t see me. She had her hand on his shoulder and I could see him thinking about her offer.

“All you have to do is reject her,” she repeated, “And you will have the position of the future Alpha.”

FLASHBACK

The day started like any other. I woke up long before the sun had even thought to rise and I started doing my usual chores. It is an unspoken rule that once the members of the house wake up by 7 a.m. the house has to be perfectly cleaned and breakfast has to be ready.

It took me three months to come up with the perfect time to rise in order to get everything done. I wake up by 3 a.m. and spend the next two hours cleaning the entire house from top to bottom. I also have to be quiet because if my father wakes up then I will be in for a lot of punishment. By the time I am done with the chores, I start breakfast which usually takes around two hours as well.

As always, I was finishing it up when my father walked down the stairs. I instantly rushed to his side with his daily steaming cup of black coffee. He took it from me with a dismissive nod and I quickly assembled his breakfast plate- eggs, bacon and sausages.

I placed them next to him and he didn’t even lift his head from his newspaper to acknowledge my presence. I refused to allow the pain show on my face as I swallowed down my hurt. It is my birthday and he couldn’t even be bothered to say a happy birthday to me.

“Good morning father,” His response was a deep grunt and a hand waving me off. “Did you rest well?”

“Do you not have any work to do Amelia?” his tone was an obvious dismissal.

I didn’t allow the pain phase me as I knew my sister would be up soon so I quickly made her special green juice that she drinks every morning.

I had poured it into her glass when she gracefully came down the stairs. My sister- Brittany- and I are twins although she is older by a few minutes. We look nothing alike though; I have very curly brown hair that is a nightmare to tame and hazel eyes while she has long blond hair and icy blue eyes. She is also tall and slender while I am shorter and have more curves. I have been told I look like our mother who died a few years back but she is a splitting image of our father.

As soon as father saw her, he pulled her into a warm hug and kissed her forehead then wished her happy birthday. He told her how proud of her he was and a stray tear slipped down my lips. I don’t know why he never treats me like her- we are twins after all. What does she have that I don’t?

“There you are,” he held her at arm’s length so he could see her, “How is the birthday girl?”

“I am so excited daddy,” she squealed, “And I cannot wait for the party tonight. Thank you so much for throwing it for me.”

“Anything for my darling,” he kissed her forehead again then he saw me watching them, “Are you going to stand there or will you bring in our breakfast?”

I muttered a small apology and hurried to hand her breakfast tray to her. As usual, she didn’t say thank you, she just took it out of my hands and delved into a conversation with father. Once again, I ignored the pain and clutched my own plate tight to my chest as I felt like an intruder in their special moment.

It has been like this for as long as I remember.And a part of me is tired of wishing that thing could be different.

When they were done eating, they left their dishes on the table and went to get ready for the day. I was still cleaning up when they left the house, leaving me in complete and utter silence.

As soon as I was sure that they were gone, I snuck out of the house into the woods that had taken over at the back. It was quiet and I was sure that no one would bother me there.

I followed the marked out path that I had become familiar with over the years. I can navigate this path blindfolded and in my sleep because of how many times I had gone through it, especially in the past few weeks.

I got to a small cave. It wasn’t big enough to draw attention to it but it was big enough that I could go in and practice without being disturbed. A few feet into the cave lay a few books I had taken from father’s library without him noticing a small blanket for when the days got colder.

I sat cross legged on the floor and imagined all the different types of wolves I had seen. I imagined my father’s which was large and black with dark brown eyes. It towered over me easily in my human form and for a very long time it terrified me.

I imagined my sisters which was smaller in size. It was a dirty brown color and in her wolf form, she had the same icy blue eyes as she did in her human form. Her wolf was graceful and petite and I smiled as I thought back to a memory of her running.

I let the feeling of completeness wash over me and I willed my own wolf to come to the surface but nothing happened. I tried harder, even tried picturing what my own wolf would look like. Would it be dirty brown like Brittany’s or black like my father’s? Maybe it would even be a different color, sandy blond or even a deep brown. I didn’t care what color it was, I just wanted it.

I don’t know how long I sat there willing, wishing and praying for my wolf to come to the surface but it never did. As the seconds ticked by I got more and more frustrated. I thought I felt hair o my skin and I opened my eyes in excitement, glad I had made a little effort but the excitement dissipated when I realized it was a stray feather.

I let out a barely contained scream and buried my head into my hands. Angry, hot tears burned beneath my eyelids and for a moment I wondered if I would ever get my wolf. For a moment, I wondered if it was even worth it at all.

But then I remembered why I was doing it all in the first place- Blake. Blake and I have been together for a while and I know that the only way for us to stay together is for me to get my wolf and then we can be properly mated.

He was the reason I started this four months ago and I am not giving up now. I wiped the tears from my face and gathered myself to my feet. I can always try again later.

I stepped out of the cave and was shocked by how dark it was. I ran as fast as I could to the house and looked at the huge grandfather clock that stood in the living room and cursed; Blake will be here to pick me up any minute from now.

I took a very quick bath and changed into the prettiest dress I own. It is an old dress I have had for a while, father said he couldn’t spare any money for a new dress for the party but that doesn’t matter because as long as I am with Blake, I am happy.

I snuck into Brittany’s room and applied a little bit of her makeup to make me look pretty and I tied my hair up into a high ponytail and waited at the bottom of the stairs for Blake to knock. I glanced at the clock and saw that he was running a bit late but I figured there must have been an emergency.

What else could it have been?

...

I waited for half an hour before I realized that something was awfully wrong. Blake is very late, in fact, we would always argue about the fact that I was always the late one. He would always arrive a few minutes early for any event and I was seriously starting to worry.

I called him with the house line and the first time it went to voicemail but the second time, he picked up on the forth ring.

“Hey,” I said as soon as the call had connected, “I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay because you’re never late.”

He muttered a small curse under his breath, “I’m sorry Amy; I won’t be able to pick you up today. Something really important came up at the last minute.”

“I-,” I trailed off, “You could have called me Blake, I was waiting here for you.”

“I’m really sorry Amy; I promise I will make it up to you.” There was a voice in the background that he paused to respond to, “Look, I have to go; I’ll see you when you get here.”

“Okay, bye.” I had barely finished what I was saying when he disconnected the call.

I tried to calm my heart and hide my hurt. Blake has never done anything like this to me before so I am sure that there is a very plausible explanation. He probably lost track of time and forgot that he had to pick me up.

I went back into my room and opened the old shoe box I had turned into my piggy bank and took out some of my savings for a taxi.

Our house was so far away from the main road that I had to walk for about another half an hour before I was able to find a single taxi. The driver’s charge was outrageous but I knew it would probably take twice the time to find another one so I agreed.

When I got to the venue, the party was in full swing. It was holding in a huge event center that father had rented out. Brittany had been talking about how it just opened and she wanted to be the first person to host a party there.

It was a large three story building with pure white walls and large glass windows and doors. On the front porch was a large crystal chandelier and from the clothes the butlers wore. I knew the entire place probably cost a fortune.

As I stepped out of the taxi, the smell of wine, sweat and a lot of perfume assaulted my nose. I paid the driver and made my way down the huge parking lot and into the front doors.

Most of the people I could see were friends of Brittany’s. I don’t have a lot of friends and Brittany wouldn’t let me invite the few that I had because she said it would ruin her perfect image and father agreed.

As soon as the people noticed me, I saw them begin to whisper and I started to feel a little self conscious. I looked down at my faded gray gown to make sure it wasn’t ripped anywhere but regardless, it looked cheap compared to the designer clothes that they people here were wearing.

“What the hell is that piece of rag?” a girl asked out loud and the entire party dissolved into a fit of laughter.

“It looks like she picked it out of a dumpster,” another offered.

A guy walked up to me and he fisted the material between his thumb and pointer finger, “it even feels cheap too. I’m sure if I tugged a little then it would rip right off.”

He pulled a little like he was going to rip it off and I gasped and pulled back in shock which made everyone laugh. I needed to get out of there immediately but they were all surrounding me.

“I can’t believe you’re even related to Brittany,” the first girl spat, “I mean look at you. Do you even know what a gym is?”

“Please just let me leave,” I pleaded and her face turned into a mock pout.

“She looks so cute when she begs,” she laughed evilly and then in one quick move, she faked a fall and spilled her champagne all over the front of my dress. “Whoops; that was an accident.”

The entire room dissolved into laughter and I pushed through the crowd to get into the bathroom. I tried my best to pat it down with water but it only made a bigger mess on the dress.

I knew I had to dry it out so I waited until the coast was clear and I snuck up the stairs to find a balcony or a porch. I finally found one on the second floor and rushed towards it when I saw that it was already occupied.

I quickly hid so that the occupants wouldn’t see me. They were wrapped in each other’s arms and passionately kissing so I’m sure they wouldn’t have seen me either way. I was about to leave when they pulled apart and the moonlight illuminated their features. I had to slap a hand against my mouth to stop the gasp from spilling out.

It was Brittany and Blake.

The shock had me rooted to the spot as Brittany ran her hand across my boyfriend’s cheek affectionately.

Is this what he meant when he told me that he was busy? He was here with my twin sister and they were making out. How could she do this to me and how could he do this to me?

“Didn’t you like that Blake?” she asked and he nodded, “Well I’m tired of us having to do it in secret. It has been so long.”

“I’m till with Amelia.” He said and she made a deep sound of disgust at the back of her throat.

“Why are you even with her?” she spat, “She has no wolf and she is not even strong. If you mate with her, you will go lower in the pack hierarchy. Why don’t you just leave her?”

“I can’t just leave her Brittany; we’ve been together for a long time.” They still hadn’t realized I was watching.

Brittany sighed and kissed him again, deeper this time. His hands wrapped around her waist and she pulled back leaving him following her for more like a lost puppy. She stroked the back of his neck softly as he gazed deeply into her eyes.

“If you break up with her then you can be stronger Blake,” she whispered, “If you mate with me instead then our union will be strong enough for you to be the future Alpha.”

“What are you saying Brittany?”

“I’m saying we are two of the strongest wolves in the pack. Imagine what our union would do.All you have to do is reject her,” hearing those words leave her mouth had me freezing in my tracks.

I carefully made my way furtherinto the balcony and hid behind a pillar so she wouldn’t see me. She had her hand on his shoulder and I could see him thinking about her offer.

“All you have to do is reject her,” she repeated, “And you will have the position of the future Alpha.”

I waited for him to tell her no, to tell her what he told me almost every day. I waited for him to tell her that he loved me and he was not going to let me go but instead, he was silent. I could see the way his brows furrowed and I knew that he was thinking about it.

The hurt rang deep and I turned around to leave but in a rush, I pushed over a potted plant and two pair of eyes came landing on me- one in surprise and one in victory.",1,1753286573.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1m7d46c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1m7d46c/from_control_to_courage_my_life_with_a/,From Control to Courage: My Life with a Narcissistic Dad,"Hey everyone! I’m a 27-year-old guy from Bulgaria, and I’ve been dealing with a narcissistic dad since I was 16. Back then, I had dreams — things like getting a summer job, helping out relatives, and eventually moving out after graduating high school at 19. But my dad crushed those goals by trying to control everything I did, constantly minimizing my feelings, and mocking the things I cared about.

Over the years, people around me would often side with him, saying things like, *“Your father knows best,”* as if his control was love and not suffocation.

I thought the internet would be my escape — a place where I could connect with people, express myself, and finally feel like I belonged somewhere. But even there, I ended up getting mocked. People made fun of my relationship with my dad, threw around the term *“daddy issues”* like it was a punchline, and dismissed my feelings without ever understanding the pain behind them.

It hurt more than I expected — like I couldn’t even find peace online. The one place I thought would feel safe turned into just another space where I had to keep my guard up.  
(*Apparently, emotional trauma is hilarious when it’s not happening to them. Go figure.*)

There were times when the pain felt overwhelming. I struggled with really dark thoughts and wrestled with a deep urge to lash out at the people who hurt me — both online and in real life. But eventually, I chose a different path: forgiveness. Not because they deserved it, but because I couldn’t keep carrying that weight around anymore.

In 2023, during one of our usual arguments, I broke down completely. Right in front of my dad. I collapsed in the middle of it all, and he didn’t even say anything — just backed off. I had finally reached my breaking point.

And after that, something in me changed. My dad once told me, *“You’re good-for-nothing.”* That used to crush me. But one day, I finally responded:  
*“So are you… but do you see me complaining about it?”*  
He stuttered for ten seconds and just told me to get out of his sight.  
It was the first time I didn’t feel small. I had finally taken a piece of my power back.

**Here’s something that happened recently:**  
We were working in the backyard — my dad, my oldest cousin (36M), my sister (35F), and two uncles. While I was working on the concrete pathway, my dad either carelessly or deliberately splashed me with wet concrete and water. My sister saw and immediately snapped, *“Why are you doing this?”* He just shrugged it off like it wasn’t a big deal.

Later, while messing with the hose settings, he accidentally sprayed my sister. She turned around so fast that he literally fumbled with the hose and nervously grinned at her. It was like a comedy scene — except, you know, not funny.

I also told my mom about something else that’s been bothering me:  
Last Christmas, there was money under the tree (about $40) meant for someone else. My dad took it, despite me telling him not to. When I reminded my mom about it — along with the concrete thing and the fact that I’ve been getting *maybe* two hours of sleep some nights — she was furious.

Between the stress, the insomnia, and the emotional exhaustion, I’ve started shutting down. I’ve stopped crying. At this point, when my dad yells, I just look at him with a cold, neutral face. Resting Bitch Face in full effect.  
Even at my maternal grandfather’s funeral last year, I didn’t shed a tear. I was the only one who didn’t. 

Recently, something unexpected happened. I went out for coffee with my aunt (my mom’s sister), and we had this chill conversation about life, work, family — nothing heavy at first. Then I opened up to her about what I’ve been going through with my dad.

And instead of brushing it off or defending him (like people usually do), she *listened*. Not only that — she shared that her son (my cousin) had just had a full-on screaming match with *his* dad. It hit me: I’m not the only one going through this kind of tension. And for once, I didn’t feel so alone or crazy for how I’ve been feeling.

Later that day, I also messaged my best friend — someone I’ve known for over 10 years. I didn’t expect a quick reply (he’s busy with work), but just writing it out and knowing he’d read it helped. He’s been a quiet constant in my life, and even when we don’t talk often, I know I’ve got at least *one* person out there who’s on my side.

Things are changing, even if just slightly. I’ve started talking, people are listening, and that numb silence I’ve lived in for years? It’s starting to break.  
I’ll let you know if it leads anywhere — maybe I’m finally ready to rewrite my story.

I feel like I am getting fabulous care there, and I love my OT so much but sometimes I forget to mention something to her and then go a week without seeing her and with the school year starting soon I want to get all my ducks in a row as we start to work on return to work. 

I am almost 5 months into recovery and although my daily headaches are being managed by medication, I am still experiencing vision issues and ocular migraines when using screens or doing things like driving or navigating busy situations and indoors with fluorescent lights. 

I am also trying to do things that might mimic a classroom setting like going to a coffee shop and having conversations with friends and their children, but those interactions leave me exhausted. Like I am too exhausted after about an hour to even feed myself or think about anything. 

On days that I stay home with limited stress, I feel almost normal. But as soon as I get keyed up it’s hard to relieve the symptoms. When I’m on my own schedule and can take breaks, I can manage my symptoms well. If I can lay down in the dark and quiet for 20 minutes with an ice pack on my neck, I can usually get back up and function ok. But how would this fit into teaching?? There’s not just opportunities to lay down during the day? Even the nurses office isn’t really dark and quiet.  

Obviously I would want to work on return to work but I’m not sure what this will even look like or do I realistically think it’s possible for my to return in a few weeks when my symptoms are still so easy to provoke? I desperately want to return and I feel like I’ve been doing everything asked of me in vestibular PT and OT and vision therapy and I’ve made so much progress, I hate to not be able to start my school year and get off on the right foot with my students.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Los Angeles Angels vs. New York Mets: A Same-Game Parlay Masterclass**

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (But They Do Tease)**  
The New York Mets (-150) are the clear favorites here, with a 64.4% win rate when favored—like a Netflix original series that actually finishes strong. The Angels (+157), meanwhile, are the baseball version of a group project in college: underdogs with a 46.8% success rate as longshots, but still hoping someone will *please* carry them.

Statistically, the Mets’ 4.4 runs per game (14th in MLB) are a well-oiled espresso machine: relentless and hard to stop. The Angels’ 4.66 ERA (26th in MLB)? That’s a sieve that’s *also* a sieve. Sean Manaea, the Mets’ pitcher, is the gatekeeper of a fortress; Brock Burke, the Angels’ starter, is the guy who forgot to lock the door and left the treasure map on the coffee table.

The totals line is set at 9 runs, with “Over” priced at 1.83-1.95 (54.3%-55.6% implied) and “Under” at 1.98-2.03 (49.5%-51.2% implied). Given the Mets’ offensive firepower and the Angels’ porous pitching, this game is a statistical inevitability for the Over—like a toddler with a cake and a birthday party.

**Digest the News: Soto’s Power, Lindor’s Magic, and the Angels’ Desperation**  
The Mets are bringing their A-game: Juan Soto (39 extra-base hits) is a human wrecking ball with a degree in psychology (he’s *psyching* out pitchers), while Pete Alonso and Francisco Lindor form a middle-of-the-order duo that could double as a demolition crew. At Citi Field, the Mets are 35-16, which is about the same win rate as a coffee shop in a caffeine convention.

The Angels? They’re hoping Taylor Ward (23 HRs) and Zach Neto can magic up enough offense to make this competitive. But their road record (25-28) is about as reliable as a weather forecast in July. Their

1m7d2zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1m7d2zj/the_last_transmission_home/,The last transmission home,"The crew of the Nexus were a sad lot. Maybe it was the cold interior of the ship or that none of them had anything really back on earth, but that never stopped me from trying to help them. No matter how many times I pulled Captain Vas out of the bottle or distracted Private Sami from just staring at the wall, I still tried to make the ship feel like home. We had a mission to complete, after all, one that was vitally important for humanity's survival, and we couldn't have anyone getting distracted. 

I was lucky that NASA trained me in a ton of different things, seeing as I was the only volunteer (this was miles better than the electric chair), so I could fill in with navigation or mechanics if either of my other crewmates were drunk or lost in their own world. Which was a lot. I suspected it would fall to me to navigate the rest of the way to the asteroid. 

                                                                     ☆ ☆ ☆

It was on one of those such days when I was fixing the dehydrator with a warm blanket wrapped around myself, that Private Sami stumbled into the room looking exhausted. She glanced over at me and her eyes lit up, finally gaining a bit of life for the first time in five days. She was clutching one of her personal items–a small photograph of her family. Based on the young boy standing in the front, I supposed it was probably from a long time ago.

She sat down at the table I was working at, and buried her face in her arms and let out a soft groan. I waited until she spoke from her cocoon of fabric to acknowledge her. 
“Hey Sabel, why are you here?” 

I turned to her, confused expression on my face 

“Like, philosophically or realistically. ‘cause I already told you and the Captain I'm here cause of a court order. It was this or the chair,” 

“I don't know what I mean.” She looked back up at me, tears beginning to form.
 
 “Why are you so cheerful?” I shrugged, tossing her a clean cloth to wipe her eyes. 

“This is important and the only way to move forward is to be cheerful” She chuckled using the cloth and nodded in agreement. 

“I suppose. I-” she looked back up to me “I hope you know I'm trying–” 

“It's fine, I know. This–” I waved to the ship behind us, “is hard.” 
She nodded in agreement, sighing.

                                                                     ☆ ☆ ☆

After I finished the repair, we ate dinner together. I loved spending time together, especially since she reminded me of back home. So, instead of pressuring her to talk more, I put on a good song and we hummed along to it together. Eventually, after I finished, Captain Vas staggered into the mess, the bags under her eyes speaking more of exhaustion than drunkenness.
Sami ran over to help her over, and I rushed to make her a cup of tea. As I handed it to her, she grumbled and said, “Sable, get me a coffee. I have duties.”

I sighed. This was just like her. When she wasn't drunk, she was usually working. I decided today was not the day for that and reassured, “Vas, Sami and I have everything down. Just… get some rest.” 

Her face twisted in annoyance. “This is my ship, you will--” She promptly fell asleep at the table. Sami looked at our captain sympathetically but seemed too lost in her own issues to do anything, until I gestured for her to help me carry the captain to the couch in our main room and throw a blanket over her. It wasn't the most comfortable, but she seemed to be thoroughly knocked out, and I didn't want her to wake up back in her messy room. 

Sami protested a little at going into the captain’s room to clean, but she knew just as well as I that it was bad for her to be surrounded by the countless bottles of alcohol littering her floor. I stopped to examine a small photograph on the floor of the captain standing in front of a beautiful valley and holding a young child. She had told me when we first met that I reminded her of her son; just a kid who had made a mistake. Her voice broke so much that I didn't have the heart to tell her she was wrong. 

We finished in pretty good time and went back to the couch to find Captain awake and staring blankly at the TV. Sami and I settled down next to her, and Sami pulled me into a hug. I didn't complain though, it's been a while since someone held me like that. 

                                                                 ☆ ☆ ☆

As always, I was awake early the next morning shivering. Back on earth, I loved waking up at dawn to see the sunrise, especially with my little sister. There wasn't any sunrise here, but it was nice to get chores out of the way first thing so I could spend the rest of the day playing video games and watching movies. 

They had stocked the ship pretty well, and I was determined to play all the high fantasy platformers available before the end of the mission. It was odd, back on earth my favorite genre had been sci-fi, but now that I was in space all I wanted to do was play games set on Earth. Or alien planets. I was a bit sad we wouldn't be exploring any alien worlds, but saving the world seemed like a good enough condolence. 

I turned around when I heard clinking in the sink behind me. The captain had laid an armful of bottles on the table and was draining them into the sink. As much as I wanted to keep a few, I didn't stop her, knowing just as well as she did what would happen if she didn't. 

After the captain was done, she walked over and pulled me into a tight hug, and I swore I heard her whisper an apology to her son.

We broke apart when Sami walked in, looking a little less lost than yesterday and actually smiling for the first time I’d seen. She looked pretty when she smiled. It made the light shine off her hazel eyes. 

“Hey, uh, Sable? Did you get the transmission device to work again? I want to send a message to my family.” 

I nodded, not wanting to remind her we’d be done with our mission by the time the messages got back to Earth. The idea freaked me out way too much to do and I knew my family probably didn't want to hear from me anyway. They blamed me for losing both their children within a month. But I got it set up for her and left the room so she could send her family a final message in private.
Captain was picking at a rehydrated meal at the table, and she looked up at me when I came over. “Is she still sending them messages? Even though…?” 

I nodded, cutting her off. “Yeah. Did you uh…send any?” 

She shook her head. Her son probably didn't want to hear from her either, after what she said to him and as far as i knew that was the only connection she had on earth. I rocked awkwardly on my feet, unsure of what to say. This may be our last conversation and it was so awkward. But maybe it didn't have to be, I felt a pang of guilt before I asked “So uh- there's a meteorite going by tonight. I was uh- wondering if you and Dannie would want to watch it with me”

She was silent for a moment and I saw her looking at me through the curtain of her black hair. She nodded. Guilt stabbed me as I was certain that she didn't remember what day it was. By the time I was done prepping my food, Sami had returned. She seemed much more smiley, the tear tracks around her eyes were much less visible than they were the last few times she had sent messages to her family.

                                                                          ☆ ☆ ☆

The observation deck was huge, easily the size of our two rooms combined. We dragged the inflatable couch in front of the large window and I even broke out the few candy bars that I'd managed to sneak in with my personal items. Or the people at NASA felt too bad to deny me this small comfort. I argued with myself over whether or not to tell Sami and Vas that we had finally reached our destination. But I knew what that would do to them, that they would retreat and I would be left alone again. I was selfish. I didn't want to be left alone. We spent the afternoon laughing and by the time it came Sami was curled up beside me asleep. Captain Vas was surprisingly calm, and accepted the end of everything with only a tight bear hug. I wondered, as we were blanketed in fire, if we would be missed. Not by our families, sure, but I would miss them, if ghosts were capable of it. We would be heroes.

Am I being a baby to doubt their recommendation?,"I (m, 47) was on vacation last week and we drove back home in a long car ride that took us 12 hours total of which I drove 10. closer to midnight I had coffee and two red bulls to be able to drive. When we came home I was feeling nauseous and dizzy and went to the bathroom. After the bathroom I lost consciousness (syncope) in the kitchen. I came back to and apparently passed out again but regained consciousness quickly. I was taken to the hospital. In the ER, they did a quick ECG and found second degree AV blocks (Mobitz 2). Over the last four days numerous ECGs were done including a stress test and a 24h test. None of them showed any AV blocks.

The ultrasound of the heart showed signs of a recent infection but the doc couldn’t say that the infection and a weakening of the heart was the reason for the AV blocks.

The doctors want to put me on a pacemaker and I wonder if it is necessary given that the AV blocks are not showing anymore. Am I being a baby or are the docs being too cautious?",1,1753286205.0,askCardiology,3,1.0,False

1. They prioritise flex over freedom - leasing a car they can't afford, getting the latest phone on credit, or buying designer clothes, whilst living paycheck to paycheck.

2. Instead of saving or investing, they inflate their lifestyle the moment they get a raise, locking themselves into higher expenses with no financial buffer.

3. They don’t understand compound interest, and either avoid investing entirely or invest in sketchy “get rich quick” schemes like crypto hype cycles or MLMs. Actively paying towards your pension, and seeking out savings accounts with better interest rates is the way to go.

4. They’ll spend £/$200 on a night out without blinking, but complain they ""can’t afford to save"" or ""don’t have enough for a house deposit.""

5. People treat credit cards like free money, racking up 20%+ APR debt while only paying the minimum balance each month.

6. They lack basic budgeting skills, have no idea where their money goes each month, and avoid looking at their bank statements out of anxiety or denial. I'm not saying you should be a cheapskate, but being mildly frugal is easy to do and best in the long term.

7. Many people have zero emergency savings, yet have multiple streaming subscriptions, frequent takeaways, and buy coffee out every day. I know ""stop buying Starbucks"" is an annoying thing older people say, but when you throw in takeouts, and having multiple streaming services, then yes, this applies to most people.

8. They buy new cars on finance every few years, losing thousands to depreciation rather than buying used and putting the difference toward real assets.

9. They confuse wants with needs - claiming they need a £/$60k SUV for their family of three or need an overseas holiday every year despite being in debt.

10. Some outright refuse to learn about money, acting like personal finance is too boring or difficult, while spending hours watching TV or scrolling social media. Just dedicate an hour a week and you'll be better off than before.

People often 100% blame external factors for their financial situation, and whilst yes, the system is hard, they ignore the fact that they do hold some responsibility, and that some people in the same system build wealth simply by making better long-term choices, who didn't start off life with a trust fund and rich parents.",0,1753286145.0,ControversialOpinions,1,0.5,False

1m7d0md,https://i.redd.it/uo7hyoprbnef1.jpeg,Day off for Syrenwe and Marina,"[Syrenwe and Marina step into Café La Leche, their favorite quiet corner in Replicatown. The café is filled only with the soft hum of jazz from an old wall speaker and the faint aroma of cinnamon, cafecito, and sweet bread.

Marina (grinning sleepily, voice still scratchy from sleep):
“Wewe, tienes esa mirada otra vez…”

Syrenwe (blinking):
“Which one?”

Marina (squinting playfully):
“The one you get when you’re overthinking or hiding something… or maybe about to admit you secretly stole a napkin holder.”

Syrenwe (laughing softly, cheeks pink):
“I didn’t steal anything.”

Marina (lifting her cafecito to her lips): “Then spill. You’ve got something in that quiet little mind of yours. I can see it.”

Syrenwe (hesitating, then gently):
“I was just thinking… I want to tell you something. About me. About my past.”

Marina (immediately soft, attentive):
“Then tell me. You know I’m all in. No judgment, mi amor.”

Syrenwe (smiling shyly):
“I grew up in Tromsø. Snow everywhere, even in April. My mom is Japanese — she used to play enka music every Sunday morning. The house always smelled like rice and miso and clean laundry. She’d braid my hair and sing along, even when she was out of tune.”

Marina (softly):
“Sounds beautiful. Cozy. Like home.”

Syrenwe (nods):
“It was. My dad’s a nurse too — he’d come home after night shifts and she’d pull him into the kitchen and slow-dance with him while dinner cooked. Barefoot. Holding a wooden spoon.”

Marina (smiling, touched):
“Barefoot kitchen dancing. Dios… that's the kind of love that sticks.”

Syrenwe (voice quiet):
“It did. It made me want to care for people, to be gentle with the world. That’s why I became a nurse.”

Marina (warm):
“And you are. So much. It’s written all over the way you are.”

Syrenwe (smiling faintly):
“Thank you. But… it wasn’t always easy. I was the quiet girl in the back. Shy. Awkward. The one with the Japanese lunchbox and weird science books. I didn’t fit in.”

Marina (frowning slightly):
“Kids can be cruel. Or just… blind.”

Syrenwe:
“I didn’t get bullied. Just ignored. Like I wasn’t there. I used to press black paper to the window and catch snowflakes. Then I’d rush to draw them before they melted. I wanted to prove they were all different.”

Marina (gently):
“You were already a little scientist. Qué ternura.”

Syrenwe (with a small laugh):
“I had a roaring pencil case. A white tiger. My dad got it for me when I got my first A. I thought it was the coolest thing ever.”

Marina (grinning):
“Ay no. You were adorable. A roaring tiger pencil case? What a menace.”

Syrenwe (laughing):
“More like a mouse pretending to be a tiger.”

(She pauses for a moment, looking down at her mug, fingers tracing the condensation slowly.)

Syrenwe:
“Nursing school was hard. Not because of the work — I liked the work. But I felt like I had to prove I belonged there. That I was smart enough. Brave enough. That being gentle wasn’t the same as being weak.”

Marina (soft but strong):
“It’s not. And you are so enough, Wewe. In every way.”

Syrenwe (blushing, voice small):
“I still have that voice in my head sometimes. The one that whispers I’m not doing enough. That I’m not enough. But then… sometimes I get moments like this. With you. And it gets quieter.”

Marina (leans forward, resting her chin on her hand):
“I’m really glad you told me all this. Sitting here with you? Feels like one of those quiet memories you hold onto when the world gets too loud.”

Syrenwe (smiling gently):
“I used to dream about this, you know? Sitting in a little café, telling someone everything, and not being afraid they’d look at me like I was broken.”

Marina (watching her):
“You’re not broken. You’re… gentle. And precise. And way funnier than you think.”

Syrenwe (smiling shyly):
“Stop…”

Marina (smirking):
“En serio, Wewe. You even apologize when you sneeze. You cry when cartoon characters are reunited. You’re the kind of person who stays behind to help someone clean up even when you’re exhausted.”

Syrenwe (quietly, with emotion):
“I just… I care. A lot. Maybe too much sometimes.”

Marina (softer now):
“I know. I see it. And I think that’s why I—”

(She stops. Something thick in her throat. A moment passes. The sunlight hits Syrenwe’s cheek just so, making her freckles glow like constellations.)

Marina (whispers):
“I think that’s why I can’t stop seeing you.”

(A long silence.)

Syrenwe (almost in a whisper):
“I think… I care about you more than I realized.”

Marina (playful, to cut the intensity):
“Oh no. That means you’re stuck with me now. I have cafecito and questionable judgment. It’s a dangerous mix.”

Syrenwe (giggling):
“I’ve seen worse.”
Marina (leaning back, holding her cup high):
“To quiet mornings and brave little truths.”

Syrenwe (clinking her mug against it):
“To snowflakes… and Cuban coffee.”

(They drink in silence, not because there’s nothing left to say — but because some feelings don’t need words.)

I enjoy coffee, and learning more about the industry and the craft, so I figured this wouldn't be a bad job to get into that didn't require a specialized degree. 

I've been working here now for just under 4 weeks and I'm struggling massively. There are the obvious tranisitonary issues like going from a job where I sit down all day to one where I'm expected to stand, being able to set/choose my own working hours and breaks, determine when and where and for how long I go to lunch. That's fine, I understand that's how it is in the fast food industry. 

But then there's also stuff where I can't tell if I'm doing a bad job or not, and if I do make a mistake, the vibe from my partners is weird afterwards. Don't get me wrong, some of my partners are nice and patient and really helpful, while some others are helpful but not patient. I got told by one of my partners that if I do something wrong, everyone gets in trouble. In the moment, I just said okay, but thinking about it afterwards, it seems I'm not allowed to make mistakes as a trainee? I understand striving to do my best but that seemed weird to me. Also, I heard this person gossiping with another partner about all the stuff I was doing wrong while I was in BOH washing up. 

To be fair, here's some of the stuff I've been doing wrong. 

* Messing up drink orders for silly reasons like brain fog or getting overwhelmed (For example: during peak hours I poured cold milk into a hot drink after my manager told me to top it up with milk. I thought surely she didn't want me to steam more milk just to top up this little bit right? But yeah, no I was wrong, and she had to make the drink over. Then she told me to step off the bar and let her handle the drinks. I have not really been back on bar since). 
* Wiping? - Apparently I am wiping the counters too frequently or in the wrong direction. I like to wipe everytime I see anything on the counter, even if its an abundance of water. 
* Mixing up my cleaning tasks based on my position that day and/or forgetting them. Sometimes I'm not even assigned cleaning tasks so I either just stand around the bar checking what needs to be restocked or sweeping the cafe.
* Listening to my barista trainer instead of SSV when SSV isn't on the floor. For example, I asked my SSV if I could go to lunch at 11 that day (worked the opening shift, which was 8 hours) and they said yeah. I went back to the floor to see if there was anything else to be done and there were no customers in the cafe, so my trainer said I could go to lunch now (it was like 10:56). When my SSV passed me on the stairs, they were upset I went to lunch early and asked who was running the shift, them or my trainer? I said them, and they told me not to do it again.

I'm sure there are other things I'm doing wrong, some partners are being very cold to me and I hate the idea of being a burden while also trying to maintain that I'm new and still learning. I've been assigned a bunch of mid shifts so I'm never really on bar or register so I'm not getting much experience besides cleaning and warming. I've been told my hot bar is terrible but that's because I have to keep asking questons to make sure I'm not making the drink wrong, and it slows things down. 

I don't even really like the job and I'm already looking at other options because I can't see myself doing this for a year, let alone 6 months. I like interacting with the customers, have no problem talking to them about their orders and their day and stuff like that. Everything else is not really that hard, just arduous and monotonous. I hate standing up for 8 hours a day with very little to do, cleaning the same things over and over, not getting much bar or register experience. I feel like I show up, I clean, people are cold to me, and then I go home. Rinse and repeat. 

Oh and made the faux pas of asking my manager for maybe shorter/part-time hours because of how overwhelming it was (I didn't mention the overwhelming part) and they said we could discuss it, but then as I was leaving I heard another partner say something to them under their breath that I couldn't make it out and they jokingly told them to stop. We have not discussed it.

Background & Observations

The rise in HbA1c seemed to begin between March and September 2024, during a period of frequent travel and poor dietary choices, including a lot of junk food and sweets like ice cream. A routine blood test at that time revealed an HbA1c in the prediabetic range (5.7%).

In response, I began making healthier food choices and incorporated more regular physical activity into my routine. This seems to have had a positive impact, as my weight gradually decreased from 172 lbs to 150 lbs over the next 8 months, and HbA1c improved accordingly.

I was initially concerned about my low C-peptide, but it appears I’m relatively insulin sensitive. For example, after a meal of 200 grams of rice with dal and yogurt, my postprandial glucose is:
	•	~135–140 mg/dL at 1 hour
	•	~120 mg/dL at 2 hours

Weight loss and consistent weight maintenance have played a significant role in this improvement along with regular physical activity.

Current Daily Routine

	Breakfast:
	•	50g mixed nuts (almonds, walnuts, macadamia, pistachios)
	•	25g seeds (pumpkin and sunflower)
	•	300 ml milk coffee (instant mix, no added sugar)

	Lunch:
	•	180–200g rice
	•	250g dal
	•	2 eggs
	•	200g Greek yogurt

	Dinner:
	•	Avocado, eggs, or oats dosa
	•	150–200g fruit
	•	Snack (optional):
	•	1 protein bar (only if daily protein intake is below 100g)


Also, I hit gym 5 days a week. 25 mins cardio and 30 mins of strength training.

1m7cq32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m7cq32,Archipelago-go - Campaign Frame,"**Link to PDF Download below.**  
  
Archipelago-go is a lighthearted campaign frame where adventurers will participate in a race across the Poko Archipelago. Together, a crew of adventurers will sail between islands, prove their skills and abilities by completing challenges at each one, and try to reach the end of the island chain before time is up.

This was my first campaign frame fully written out and my design goals for it were.

1. **Keep it simple.** I wanted this to be an easy campaign that first time GMs or Players could navigate. No new, custom game mechanics so players can focus on learning the core rules of Daggerheart. The island hopping race provides a structure for new GMs so that they always know what the next part of the story is going to be and they can limit their focus on providing fun, isolated encounters as island challenges. But should they feel comfortable to create encounters and side stories outside of the race structure, the frame allows and even encourages them to do so.
2. **Keep it light.** Not that I don't like grim or world ending adventures, but there is a lot of that out there already. I wanted to offer something different and keep it light, fun, and low stakes.
3. **Make it a stepping stone.** As mentioned in #1 I wanted this to be a good ""first campaign"" and I wanted it to be a good spring board into new arcs once players complete it. The campaign length is easy to adjust by adjusting the length of the race so you can keep it small and make it the first arc for a party, or make it long and ""the"" campaign. This frame is also about ""proving oneself"" and ""coming of age"" which makes a good first arc that afterwards the party can go on to bigger adventures.

If you're interested in a PDF copy you can find that here: [https://www.patreon.com/posts/134649802/](https://www.patreon.com/posts/134649802/) It is a Patreon link but it is completely free to download. There is a ""full"" version that includes example encounters for island challenges, campaign themed adversaries, and three more pre-made maps as a thank you to anyone interested in putting a few dollars into helping me buy coffee or more art but everything you need to run the campaign is available free to all.

The Hamilton Beach 46111 5 Cup Drip Coffee Maker offers a highly practical solution for small kitchens, dorm rooms, or apartments. As someone who struggles with limited countertop space, this model fits perfectly under cabinets without looking bulky. Its black and stainless steel design also gives off a polished aesthetic, matching most modern kitchen styles. My first thought when I set it up was amazement at how lightweight and sleek it was—only 3.3 pounds but feels sturdy. The compact size doesn’t compromise its usability; it’s surprisingly feature-packed, considering its smaller frame.  

**Easy Front-Filling System**  
One of the most convenient features of this coffee maker is its FrontFill water reservoir and swing-out brew basket. Adding water and coffee grounds under cabinets is no longer a headache, as I don’t have to pull out the machine every time. The well-thought-out design means fewer spills, a recurring annoyance with many drip coffee makers I’ve used before. This feature is particularly handy during mornings when I’m half-asleep and prone to making a mess in the kitchen.  

[Check Hamilton Beach 46111 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b082ls88wn/)  

**Perfect for Daily Needs**  
Brewing up to five cups might not seem like much for a large family, but for single individuals or couples, it’s exactly the right amount. I love that it minimizes coffee waste, something I’ve been guilty of with larger machines. The unit brews just the amount I need without any leftover that goes cold or wasted. If you’re someone trying to reduce your footprint and avoid waste, this model will cater perfectly to your needs.  

**User-Friendly Programming**  
Programming this device is incredibly intuitive. The easy-touch programming enables me to set it up the night before so I can wake up to freshly brewed coffee. It’s reliable, and the clock is simple to configure even if you’re not a tech-savvy person. No digging through manuals or guesswork is required; just basic button presses and voila, the machine handles the rest. I remember even my coffee-illiterate younger sibling managed to set the timer, which speaks volumes for its ease of use.  

**AutoPause & Pour Option**  
I have to confess, patience isn’t my strongest virtue, especially in the mornings. The AutoPause & Pour function allows me to sneak a cup mid-brew without leaving coffee dripping onto the hot plate. This little detail might seem minor, but it’s been a lifesaver on days when I’m rushing for work and can’t wait for the full brewing cycle to complete. It’s the kind of thoughtful touch that elevates the daily user experience.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Space-saving design perfect for small kitchens.  
- FrontFill water reservoir prevents spills and enhances convenience.  
- Programmable clock for smooth mornings with hot coffee ready.  
- AutoPause & Pour function guarantees no mess during mid-brew pours.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Like every product, this one isn’t without flaws.  
- The carafe isn’t insulated, which means the coffee cools down faster than I’d like.  
- The unit doesn’t come with a reusable filter—relying on paper ones adds recurring costs.  
- It’s not ideal for households that drink coffee in large quantities.  

**Competitive Options**  
Compared to popular models like the Black+Decker CM0700BZ or Mr. Coffee Mini, the Hamilton Beach coffee maker excels in compactness and intuitive design. The user-friendly programming and FrontFill features make it stand out, as other compact models often compromise ease of use or create more mess during prep. That said, Mr. Coffee offers a slightly cheaper model with a double-walled carafe to keep coffee warm for longer durations, which this device lacks. Nonetheless, if you prioritize functionality over added features, this coffee maker edges slightly ahead.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
When you consider the features packed into this compact coffee maker versus its reasonable price point, it delivers strong value. Coffee makers with AutoPause capabilities, programming options, and high-quality builds traditionally sit in a higher price bracket. I personally appreciate how much thought went into designing something functional yet affordable; this is the epitome of smart spending.

1m7cm3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1m7cm3d/magnifica_xs_ecam22110sb_flashing_red_triangle/,Magnifica XS ECAM22110SB Flashing Red Triangle (FIXED),"Just want to leave this hear for anyone else having problems.

TLDR; Bad Hall Effect Sensor on the Transmission causes blinking red triangle and failure to complete startup cycle. Not a transmission issue, so save your money.

I purchased my espresso maker in June of 2017 and it worked great for about 4 years. Then all of a sudden, when the unit was turned on, it would cycle the Infuser like normal but then the Red Triangle would start flashing and the unit would stop. No amount of resetting or entering test mode was of any help.

At the time, when I did my research (2021), all of the online help pointed to the transmission being bad. Users were saying that the bushings that hold the screw drive were wearing out and you needed to replace the transmission assembly. Online pricing for the transmission was around $200 - $250 and I didn't have the money back then to replace it.

I looked around for a while, but pricing never came down and eventually parts houses were always out of stock or listed the unit as discontinued. So, I just boxed the unit up and put it into storage thinking maybe one day I'd revisit it.

Well, a couple of weeks ago I happened to be browsing ebay and noticed that there was a used transmission for less than $50, so on a whim, I went ahead and bought it. I went to storage and dug the unit out and swapped out the transmission, which was way easier than I thought it was going to be. The unit comes apart pretty quickly and not a lot to take off to get to the transmission.

However, that was a no-go and the unit had the same issue. I took the unit back apart and compared the two transmissions side by side to make sure there wasn't anything that I missed. Funny thing is, both units seem to have the ""bushing"" issue according to what I viewed on YouTube. You could move the drive screw about 1mm each way. Thinking I just bought a bad transmission and I'd have to find another or find a way to replace the bushings and possibly the drive screw, I put the old unit back in and switched it on.

Thats when I heard a loud snap and the unit jammed up. In my haste and frustration, I had reassembled the Infuser trolley incorrectly and when I got it apart I found I had snapped the guide pin off. So off to the web I went to find a replacement, if I could. Of course, no one carries parts for this model anymore, but some sites listed substitutes for various parts.

OLD PART: [Delonghi ECAM22110SB Fully Automatic Espresso Machine Trolley– Delonghi Parts](https://www.delonghispareparts.com/products/delonghi-ecam22110sbfully-automatic-espresso-machine-7313212631-replacement-part)

NEW ITEM: [Delonghi Drip Coffee Maker Trolley Greyral70 Assembly - AS00006298– Delonghi Parts](https://www.delonghispareparts.com/products/as00006298)

In my online search I found a lot of new information and a few parts that seemed to be frequently replaced for various issues. I decided to buy a couple of each to make sure I got them while I could. Various seals, a couple of trolleys and a couple of Hall Effect sensors.

When the parts arrived, I replaced the trolley with the new one and fired it up. However, now the unit would not cycle at all. Thinking I messed something up I disassembled the machine, taking out the transmission then reassembled everything and tried again. Nothing. It jammed up somewhere in the middle of trying to cycle and rehome.

At this point I'm thinking it might be a good time to replace the Hall Effect sensor, since I had one, and see what happens. So, I did that.

OLD PART: [Delonghi ECAM22110SB Fully Automatic Espresso Machine Sensor Board– Delonghi Parts](https://www.delonghispareparts.com/products/delonghi-ecam22110sbfully-automatic-espresso-machine-5213213981-replacement-part)

NEW PART: [Delonghi Espresso Machine Hall Sensor (L620) - AS00000602– Delonghi Parts](https://www.delonghispareparts.com/products/as00000602)

However, upon receiving the HE sensor and trying to install it, I found out the cable on the new part is too short to reach the main board. I got it to work, but I had to do a little splicing with the ribbon cable from the old sensor to get the right length.

Got it all put back together, fired it up, same issue. Stops before reaching the lower limit switch. By now I'm pretty frustrated and not really paying close attention to the new symptoms. But in poking around and trying to find out what was happening I noticed I couldn't remove the waste grounds tray. I opened the unit and low and behold, the new trolly was jammed against the tray. I took out the trolley and compared it to the old trolley and found they were different.

Now, I could completely remove the trolley, which meant taking off all the side panels and top and then shave down the part that was making contact with the bottom tray, but it was late and I was burnt out. Instead, I just filed down the empty grounds tray to see if that would work before I dug in any deeper. Only needed to file down about a 1/2 inch wide by about 1/4 inch of the plastic grounds tray and was able to get the tray to slide in and out easily.

I fired up the unit and BOOM the unit cycled and went into ready mode. I filled the unit with water, ran test mode to put it through its paces and all was well. Performed a couple of descale clean procedures and this morning I was able to make espresso again.

So, if you were thinking maybe your $500 unit was junk, maybe it's not and with a little modification here and there, you will be back to drinking your shots. My guess is, that when I did my initial research and you could purchase the transmission new online, it also came with a new hall effect sensor already mounted and that is really what the problem was as the ""play"" in the drive seems to make no difference.

So this morning my partner and I were making breakfast together and she told me she had a crazy dream last night. I had asked about it while I was making breakfast and coffee and working from home. 

She then told me about the dream she had and she was being very vulnerable to me. Unfortunately i felt overwhelmed by the amount of emotion and thought she was provoking that I had not payed attention to her which obviously led to her feeling sad about that. (This isn’t the first time I’ve done that and we keep getting into this cycle). 

This is completely nobody’s fault but my own and I want to know how I can go about being a better listener and being okay with vulnerability. Why do her emotions feel so overwhelming to me?

I can’t tell if it’s my adhd or if I’m using that as an excuse to hide away from my feelings.

I want to be a better partner What can I do? 

(P.s I can’t afford my therapist rn)

TL;DR 
I’m not able to listen to my partner be vulnerable I get overwhelmed by it and shut down. I want to learn to be a better partner and person. ",0,1753284912.0,relationships,10,0.33,False

But what I'm saying is when you're surrounded by people talking on and on about diet and exercise.

We won't get specific though.

 I'm someone who wants to recover but can't because I really can't do it on my own and I don't have access to professional help.

Today when I was riding the metro micro (if you don't live in a metro area and don't know what that is, it's basically like an uber and public transport combined. You request one and they pick you up and drop you off but they pick you up and drop you off at the nearest bus stop, they don't pull into specific places, and you don't get to choose whether or not you want to ride with other passengers so you will sometimes have to do that.
Anyway when I was riding metro micro today, there was one other passenger and him and the metro micro driver were talking. The WHOLE time all they talked about was diet and exercise.

I highly suspect this guy has an ed because the way he talks about it all mirrors me when I was deep in an ed. He gave all this diet and exercise advice under the guise of ""healthy"" but briefly mentioned feeling bad sometimes and most things he suggested are actually pretty restrictive. 

But it was still harmful for me to hear all of this. It still just reminded me how I was once so ""good"" at my ed and now I'm not. I still have all the same knowledge he has. I never forgot all the extremely detailed and comprehensive diet and exercise stuff. 

And I was sitting there, having gained a lot of weight since I was deep in my ed, thinking ""this guy must be judging me. I know because when I was that deep in my ed I would've judged me""

And the whole conversation made me want to relapse back into the restricting side. 

He said something that stuck with me. The metro micro driver was talking about how hard it is to give up certain foods. He said ""I know, I love those foods too, but those foods don't love you back""

I've never thought that before but now I definitely will be. Now I'm thinking to myself ""food doesn't love you back, but maybe my ed does""

I actually was planning to get coffee, and I probably still will. But now I'm not going to be able to fully enjoy it. Now I'm gonna feel bad about it.

We’re a bit unsure about how tipping works in the U.S., especially in Nashville. Here are a few things we’re wondering:
- Is tipping usually done in a visible/active way, or more discreetly?
- How much is considered appropriate in different situations?
- Do you only tip when you have table service, or also when getting a coffee at the counter or ordering at a bar?
- Is it better to tip in cash, or is tipping by credit card fine?
- Any other do’s or don’ts you think we should know?

If you want to fix your life, you attack these seven areas. Period.","# The 7-Point Ruthless Guide to Un-F*cking Your Life



Feeling stuck? Sad? Like everything's pointless? Good. That's your cue to stop moping and start working. Your problems, 99% of the time, boil down to deficiencies in these 7 areas. Address them. Ruthlessly.



# 1. Budget: Master Your Money. Or It Masters You.



* **The Problem:** Debt. No savings. Constant financial anxiety. You're a slave to your paycheck, and it barely covers anything. You buy crap you don't need and wonder why you're broke.
* **The Fix:**
   * **Know Every Dollar:** Track *every single cent* coming in and going out for a month. No excuses. Apps like Mint or YNAB make this dead simple.
   * **Cut Hard:** Identify non-essentials. Subscriptions you don't use. Daily coffees. Eating out constantly. *Cut them.* You don't need them.
   * **Allocate:** Give every dollar a job. Needs (housing, food, utilities), then Debt/Savings, then Wants. Follow a 50/30/20 rule if you need a start.
* **Why It Matters:** Financial freedom isn't about being rich; it's about not being trapped. When your money is under control, a massive weight lifts. Stress drops. You gain options.



# 2. Time Management: Stop Wasting Your Life.



* **The Problem:** You're busy but unproductive. Always ""stressed"" but never doing what matters. Hours vanish into screens. You complain about no ""free time"" but spend it aimlessly.
* **The Fix:**
   * **Audit:** Track your time for a week. Seriously. Where does it *actually* go? You'll be disgusted.
   * **Prioritize Ruthlessly:** Identify 1-3 *critical* tasks for each day. Do those first. No distractions.
   * **Block It Out:** Schedule everything: work, gym, family, learning, even downtime. If it's not on the calendar, it doesn't exist.
   * **Limit Distractions:** Put the phone away. Close unnecessary tabs. Focus on one thing at a time.
* **Why It Matters:** Your time is your life. Wasting it is wasting your life. Efficient time management buys you back hours for what *actually* enriches you.



# 3. Saving: Your Future Self Will Thank (or Curse) You.



* **The Problem:** No emergency fund. Living paycheck to paycheck. Retirement is a distant fantasy. You're one unexpected bill away from disaster.
* **The Fix:**
   * **Emergency Fund First:** Prioritize 3-6 months of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account. This is non-negotiable.
   * **Automate It:** Set up automatic transfers from your checking to savings/investments the day you get paid. You can't spend what you don't see.
   * **Start Small, Be Consistent:** Even $25/week. It adds up. Consistency beats large, infrequent deposits.
   * **Invest Early:** Once the emergency fund is solid, get into a 401k (especially if there's employer match—that's free money, dummy!) or a Roth IRA. Compounding interest is magic.
* **Why It Matters:** Security. Options. Peace of mind. Not having to panic when the car breaks down. Building wealth means building a future, not just surviving today.



# 4. Health: Your Body is Your Temple (Or Your Prison).



* **The Problem:** Low energy. Bad mood. Aches and pains. Looks fading? Yeah, because you're eating garbage and sitting on your ass. Your physical state dictates your mental state.
* **The Fix:**
   * **Move Every Day:** Minimum 30 minutes of elevated heart rate. Walk. Run. Lift weights. Just move.
   * **Eat Real Food:** Ditch the processed crap. Focus on lean protein, vegetables, fruits. Drink water. It's not rocket science.
   * **Sleep:** 7-9 hours. Non-negotiable. Quality sleep fixes more problems than you realize. Put the damn phone away before bed.
   * **Check-ups:** Go to the doctor. Get blood work. Don't ignore warning signs.
* **Why It Matters:** Energy. Clarity. Longevity. Confidence. Everything is harder when you feel like crap. Prioritize your health, and everything else gets easier.



# 5. Social Circle: You're Not an Island. (And You Shouldn't Be).



* **The Problem:** Loneliness. Isolation. No one to talk to or rely on. You scroll social media wishing you had what others do, but you don't put in the effort.
* **The Fix:**
   * **Audit Your Circle:** Who genuinely lifts you up? Who drains you? Ruthlessly prune the latter.
   * **Reach Out:** Call, text, or schedule plans with 1-2 positive people *this week*.
   * **Join Something:** A club, a class, a volunteer group, a recreational sports league. Shared interests are goldmines for connection.
   * **Be Present:** When you're with people, *be with them*. Put the phone away. Listen.
* **Why It Matters:** Humans are wired for connection. A strong, supportive social circle provides resilience, diverse perspectives, and joy. Isolation kills.



# 6. Religion/Spirituality: Find Your Anchor.



* **The Problem:** Feeling lost, aimless, or without a higher purpose. Life feels random and meaningless. You crave something more but don't know where to look.
* **The Fix:**
   * **Explore:** Read. Visit different places of worship. Meditate. Listen to podcasts on philosophy or spirituality. Don't dismiss things out of hand.
   * **Reflect:** What do *you* believe about the universe, purpose, morality? Journal on these questions.
   * **Connect with Meaning:** This could be formal religion, a deep connection with nature, secular philosophy, or intense creative pursuit. Find what gives *you* a sense of awe, peace, or guiding principles.
* **Why It Matters:** A strong internal framework provides resilience in the face of chaos. It gives meaning beyond the mundane. It can offer comfort, community, and a sense of belonging to something larger than yourself.



# 7. Unique Story: Live a Life Worth Telling.



* **The Problem:** Feeling boring, uninspired, or like your life is just drifting. You have no passions, no goals, nothing to look forward to.
* **The Fix:**
   * **Identify Values:** What truly matters to you? Not what society says, but *you*? Integrity? Adventure? Creativity? Service?
   * **Set Audacious Goals:** Not just career goals. What do you want to *do*? Learn a language? Climb a mountain? Write a book? Start a business? Take big swings.
   * **Take Action:** Break those big goals into tiny, actionable steps. Take one step *today*.
   * **Reflect & Adjust:** Regularly review your progress. What's working? What's not? Your story isn't linear.
   * **Contribute (Charity):** Beyond yourself. Volunteer. Help others. Your legacy is defined by what you give back. This *is* part of your unique story.
* **Why It Matters:** This is the purpose. This is the fulfillment. This is why you're here. If you're not actively crafting your unique story, you're just existing.

**Bottom line: Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Pick one area, any area, and put in the work. Ruthlessly. The results will come. They always do.**",0,1753284345.0,getdisciplined,0,0.5,False

Turns out it’s not just about packing boxes and updating the address. Thought I’d share a few random things I really wish someone had warned me about:

1. Google Maps isn’t exactly wrong, but:
You see “15-minute walk” to campus, but add 10 more minutes if you're carrying anything, dealing with traffic lights, or it's 30°C out. Always test it in different times of a day to find out the perfecf time you need to avoid lateness.

 2. Utilities setup can be a struggle
 Electricity, internet, water billing., and so on. No one tells you these don’t always come bundled. And sometimes it takes a week (or more) to get Wi-Fi.

 3. It’s okay if your new place doesn’t feel like home right away
 It took me a month to stop feeling like I was just ""visiting."" That’s normal. And the feeling of being homesick does not disappear completely - even after a few months it may be really strong sometomes and you should be prepared for that

4. Try one small routine from your old life
 For me, it was Sunday morning coffee. Doing something familiar in a new place helped more than I expected.

 5. Friendship takes longer than orientation week
 Not everyone will find “their people” right away. Give it time. You’re not behind, you’re just new.

6. Leave room in your budget for surprises
No additional explanation needed. 

7. Write down your “why” for moving
 You’ll have days when you wonder if this was a mistake. Having a note to your future self can help you push through the doubt.

If you’re also moving soon (or recently did), what helpful things would you add to the list?",1,1753284225.0,StudyStruggle,0,1.0,False

Not pain exactly - more like a fog had settled inside his brain. A strange warmth clung to his eyes, making it hard to see. The room was a blur of light and soft shapes.

As his vision adjusted, things sharpened into place.

The room was quiet.

Then he noticed the girl.

She was lying on his sofa, curled on her side. Her hands were restrained with a ribbon - tied deliberately, palms together, like a present someone didn’t want to open.

Muse blinked.

“What...?” he muttered. “Who is this?”

He looked around.

The apartment was locked. Windows shut. No sign of a break-in. Everything looked exactly the same as it always did. Nothing disturbed - except her.

Then she moved.

Muse tensed. She was waking up. And no matter how he sliced it, this looked bad for him.

“Good morning,” she said softly, already sitting up. Her hands were still bound. “I guess I just fell asleep like that.”

Muse stared at her in silence.

“Would you please untie me?”

He obeyed without a word.

“Can I borrow your toilet for a bit?”

He nodded.

She stood carefully, adjusted her skirt, and walked toward the bathroom like she knew the place. Like she belonged here.

A few minutes later, she returned. Her bangs were slightly damp - she’d washed her face.

The silence stretched, heavy with questions. Muse finally spoke.

“D-Did I let you in?”

She looked at him with a pout. “Eh? Don’t tell me you don’t remember me. Especially after everything that happened between us.”

Muse’s brow twitched. She was gorgeous - long black hair, pale skin, and striking blue eyes. A mix of elegance and danger. His heart was racing, but his mind felt like a static screen.

“Wh-What exactly happened between us?” he asked, trying not to stare too long.

“Try to guess,” she teased. Her tone was playful, but something unreadable lurked beneath it. Had she noticed his reaction? Was she messing with him? Or… did something really happen?

“We both... slept?” he guessed, face flushing.

“Yeah, we did.” Her smile deepened. “But you really don’t remember me?”

“No,” he admitted. “I don’t think so.”

“I see,” she said, eyes lowering. “Then I guess we’re strangers again, huh?”

She stepped closer and held out her hand.

“My name is Mesmer. Pleased to meet you—again.”

“Again?” Muse didn’t shake her hand.

She gave him a look—serious now. “What I’m about to say might sound unbelievable. But promise you’ll believe me.”

Muse hesitated. “Sure.” He said it mostly to keep things calm. The last thing he needed was to end up in a courtroom sketch.

Mesmer took a breath.

“You’re already dead,” she said. “But we managed to keep your brain alive using a device called the Adaptive Brain Interface - ABI for short. You’ve only been awake, fully functional, for about two weeks.”

Her words echoed in Muse’s head. Blurry images flashed behind his eyes, as if his brain were searching for something - anything - to contradict what she’d just said. But it was useless. He couldn’t remember.
All he had was the unshakable conviction that he was still here. Alive.

“What the hell are you talking about?” he blurted out.

“I know. It’s hard to believe,” Mesmer said, her voice soft, almost rehearsed. “We’ve already had this conversation before.”

She reached for his hands, slipping her fingers between his and gently pulling herself closer.

“Your hands are warm. I can feel your breath. Your heartbeat. Tell me - how are you dead, if your body’s still working and your consciousness is still here?”

Their eyes met. There was a strange glint in hers - something like longing, or relief. Muse looked away, uncomfortable. He could feel her touch. Too real to be imagined.

“Isn’t that just because I’m actually alive?” he asked, brow furrowing.

“Yes, exactly! That’s what I’m saying,” she beamed. “You’re the first human we’ve successfully brought back to life. Proof that miracles exist.”

She leaned back, settling into a more casual posture. Muse didn’t know how to respond.

“That sounds like a heavy role,” he muttered. “You sound like a muse.”

“You mean, an artistic woman?” She smirked. “Yeah, I suppose. Incidentally, that’s your name. Muse. Do you remember?”

“I think so. I kind of… knew it already.”

“Good. We’re still monitoring your neural recovery. Resurrection is complicated.” She reached for a sleek, black device - something between headphones and a crown—and held it out.
“Here. Put this on.”

“What is it?” Muse asked, inspecting the strange tech.

“Audiotherapy. It plays a frequency that helps recover your memory. Like jump-starting the mind.”

“And how does that work?”

Mesmer’s eyes lit up.

“Well... have you ever heard of Schumann’s Resonance?”

She balled her fists excitedly, like she couldn’t wait to explain.

“No. I’m dumb.”

“You’re not dumb.” Her tone was oddly genuine. “Schumann’s Resonance is a frequency the Earth emits. A researcher found that certain frequencies align with brainwave patterns. Basically, we discovered that some frequencies can mimic brainwaves - and influence how the brain fires.”

Muse blinked.

“I kind of get it. But also not.”

“That’s okay,” she said, nodding quickly. “To summarize: we figured out how to encode memories as frequencies. That device can replay them directly into your neural pathways. Like a flash of your life… compressed, super fast.”

“That’s… wow.” Muse studied her, unsure. She’s either a genius or completely insane, he thought.
Still, what harm could it do to play along?

“I’ll wait,” Mesmer said gently. “Go ahead. Do your thing.”

Muse mulled it over. A headphone that can return your memories - it felt like something out of cheap sci-fi. But he wanted answers. Who was he, really? Could she actually be telling the truth?

Regaining his composure, Muse put it on. Nothing. No music or noise. Just silence.
“Hey, is there something wrong with this?”

“Yeah, put your hand on the right bud. It’ll work.”

“Like this?” Muse touched it with his palm.

Suddenly, a strong buzzing.
Boom. His mind went blank.

Flashes filled his head - overwhelming, dreamlike images that vanished as quickly as they came.

And then - nothing.

He couldn’t tell how long he’d been gone. A second? An hour? But suddenly, it was there. He remembered everything. What his life was. Who she was. Who he was.

“Welcome back, Muse.” She looked at him with a soft expression.

“Hey there, Mesmer. Sorry about that.” His tone changed. For the first time since morning, he felt in control.
“About last night... I mean.”

“Oh, it’s okay. I’m basically your assistant. It’s normal for me to take care of you.”

“Still - I shouldn’t have put you through all that. I feel like I lost my mind yesterday.” Guilt crept into his voice.

“It’s okay. Everything works out. I’m used to taking care of people. I live with a family of four. Granted, they’re usually not so out of touch with reality - but hey, new experiences.”

“Why does that happen, anyway?”

“Well, if you must know - my hypothesis is that when your ABI runs low on charge, you start to lose your filter. The one that keeps your imagination from bleeding into reality. So you hallucinate. You see and hear things that aren’t there.”

“Like I was drugged?”

“Not quite. I’d call it a lucid hallucinatory state - maybe close to schizophrenia, but more in control. You’re still aware. Just… stripped of inhibition. As the ABI dies, your mental barriers weaken. You start reverting. Acting younger. More impulsive.”

“Like a child.”

“Exactly.”

“So the reason I tied you up was because I was afraid you might draw on my face while I was sleeping. And that I was scared of sleeping alone.”

“Yes. You were really cute that way,” Mesmer said - maybe a little too honestly.

“Shut up,” he mumbled, embarrassed.

Realizing the time, he got up and told Mesmer to head home.

“Oh yeah, sure. I have to be early today. But since I’m already here - maybe we can have some breakfast? Or are you not the type to eat in the morning?”

“Sometimes, I guess. Cooking is a pain,” he replied hesitantly. “But you should eat. Don’t mind me.”

“Like I said, I’m offering to cook. Would you like some?”

“Why not? But is it okay with you? You should at least call your parents. You weren’t home last night.”

“I will. Go shower.”

“I’m not sure what ingredients I have, but I’m sure you can figure it out.”
And with that, he stepped into the shower.

Steam wafted from the cracked bathroom door. Muse never liked brisk showers. He needed the time - and the excuse - to stay out of Mesmer’s way.

A warm aroma crept through the apartment. A home-cooked meal was a luxury he never thought he’d miss. The scent stirred something - his mother, maybe. A faded warmth he couldn't quite picture anymore. Maybe he lacked imagination. Or maybe it had just been too long since he’d seen her - alive.

“Smells good. Is this how your house usually smells, or do you just live off takeout?” Muse called out with a weak grin.

“Well, I usually wake up with my hands tied, so I don’t get the chance to cook,” Mesmer answered with dry sarcasm.

“Ugh, just forget about that, please.”

Mesmer smirked - or whatever expression people make when they’re clearly enjoying your embarrassment. She was a sly one, Muse thought. The kind who’d tease him about this for the rest of his life. But for what it was worth, the idea amused him.

After getting dressed, he helped her set plates on the counter.

“Some coffee would be nice,” Muse sighed.

“That’s still illegal, you know.”

“What’s the harm though?” he muttered. “It’s just a bit of caffeine.”

Mesmer’s expression shifted-more serious now. “I know you were born in the old world, but ever since you got the ABI installed, caffeine can mess with you. Your implant doesn't just enhance your brain-it controls it. Heartbeat, breath, hormones. Everything. Other people can survive if their ABI fails. You can’t.”

“So what, I keel over if I take a sip?”

“As a stimulant, caffeine can heighten anxiety, sure. But with ABI manipulating your neurochemistry in real time, even small triggers can be amplified a hundredfold. Irrational thoughts, panic attacks - if your ABI interprets the wrong signal, it could start overriding your systems in unpredictable ways.”

Muse blinked, then slumped. “You talk too much.”

“You asked.”

“You’re right. I’m sorry.”

“As long as you get it.”

“You sound smart for someone still living with their parents,” he said, trying to regain the upper hand.

“Says the one who has to be babysat like a child,” she shot back.

“Ugh. I told you to forget about that.” He rubbed his forehead.

“Well,” she said with a soft shrug, “I don’t really mind.”

Silence filled the room - but it wasn’t awkward. It hung there, warm. Comfortable.

Then, Muse suddenly spoke.

“Hey… do you think it’s unfair? That I still age normally?”

Mesmer looked surprised. Maybe it was the bluntness. Maybe she hadn’t expected him to ask that.

“I... I don’t know. It’s just… how things are. Evolution, or entropy, or the universe being cruel. I’ll be lucky to make it to 40. You? You could live to 80. Even 100. Because you were born in the old world.”

Muse’s eyes lowered. “And why am I a miracle again?”

“Because you’re proof we don’t have to die so young. That if we can keep a brain alive, we can keep someone alive.”

“So that’s it?”

“You’re more than that. You’re proof that hope still exists.” She hesitated, then added: “You are a miracle in flesh.”

Honestly, Muse didn’t feel like a miracle.

Suddenly, Muse starts feeling the air getting heavier. The food tasted like metal. A weird smell starts to enter his nose, yet can't quite make out what it is. As if something is there, but invisible to the eyes. The ABI device starts buzzing and flickering red.

Mesmer, realizing something's wrong says ""Oh no no that's not supposed to happen!"" 

She grabbed his hand. And... She's saying something. 

Strangely, her voice echoes... Why? Her beautiful face starts to distort. Muse tried saying something, but his mouth doesn't make a noise. In fact, most of his body wouldn't respond to him. What's going on?

""You're going into seizure...! Lay down"" She echoes.

Ahhh. So that's why. Then everything goes dark for Muse.",1,1753284017.0,u_IzzatQQDir,0,1.0,False

I have taken out the idea of flowers as countdown in my manuscript. More distance from Disney. For Gabrielle, I hope that is better communicated in the first 300 that she represents the village’s normalcy, not entitlement like Gaston. Thanks in advance!

— Query —

AN INCONVENIENT FAIRYTALE is a standalone romantic fantasy (84,000 words); a modern Beauty and the Beast reimagining. It blends the cozy charm of HOUSE IN THE CERULEAN SEA with the mythic intrigue of NETTLE AND BONE. Told in dual POV, it’s perfect for fans of character-driven fantasy and slow-burn romance. 

Bellamy Beaumont prefers fantasy novels to real-life drama. With the eccentric experiments of his alchemist mother, life is strange, but predictably so. Then he meets Evette D’Louvre, the cursed noblewoman who lives in a crumbling estate at the edge of the woods.

Evette appears to be in her early twenties but has lived centuries cursed as a beast for a scandalous crime of passion: the murder of her husband and his lover. After 450 years to learn to give and receive love, she has failed. With only eight days until her final transformation, she returns to her crumbling mansion, resigned to her fate.

Discovering Bellamy's mother has created life through alchemy, Evette hopes science can buy her more time. She hires the Beaumonts to help investigate the curse under the guise of estate restoration. What begins with shared renovations deepens into fragile intimacy. Bellamy believes relentless love can rewrite her story. But his quiet care only provokes the beast, torn between savage freedom and a brutal urge to protect her from pain.

However, not everyone cares if the curse is broken. The village wants to bury the scandals of the D’Louvre name for good. And Bellamy, for all his bookish bravado, may find fairytales harder to rewrite than he thought.

There’s no salvation through heroics or true love’s kiss—only the quiet care built between dustpans and breakfasts. If Bellamy’s stories have taught him anything, it’s that believing someone is worth saving might be the strongest magic of all.

— First 300 —

Funny how the moment you reach for peace, the universe smacks your hand away. I had barely cracked open my book behind the counter—just one quiet page—when the front bell shrieked. I fumbled to shove the novel under the till as Gabrielle Laitier strolled in. Sunglasses perched on her head like a crown. Bright orange hair blazed in the morning light. Her strut could conquer kings. Good thing I was just a bookshop barista in his twenties, armed with a fantasy novel for a shield, a marker for a sword.

Behind her, a small entourage of vibrant women cackled loud enough to shatter my remaining peace. Gabrielle leaned against the counter, a cloud of citrus perfume preceding her. 

“Bonjour, Bellamy.” She smiled with effortless sweetness.

I gulped. “Bonjour. Having your usual?” I grabbed a paper cup and scribbled. “Medium iced, caramel syrup, whipped cream, and mocha drizzle?”

She lifted her chin. “You know me so well.”

“It’s—it’s the same order since middle school—”

The girls erupted, a cacophony of squawked orders. I fumbled for more cups, scribbled demands, the ink smudging as my grip tightened. The espresso hissed, the frother whined, and the air filled with the heady scent of coffee. One of them giggled as I nearly splashed hot mocha on her perfectly coordinated beige outfit… and onto myself. I pushed through, my focus narrowed, until, finally, a tray of custom-made coffees stood before them, a testament to my caffeine-fueled endurance.

“Feeling alright?” another asked. I nodded, heat creeping up my neck as I set the tray before them and wiped sweat off my brow.

Gabrielle took a slow, deliberate sip. “Do you have a date for the festival tonight?”

""Um, no… I was–""

""Perfect. Meet me by the fountain at sunset."" Her bright eyes held mine for a moment longer than comfortable. “Unless you get a better offer.”

I've been slowly moving towards medium and darker roasts, but haven't found quality beans at my price points that still have a subtle fruity undertone. 

I'd love recommendations for beans that are more on the medium-dark, but still have that slight fruity undertone especially as the cup cools.

My budget is about $12-14 per 12oz bag, or $16-19/lb. Open to buying in bulk. Does such a bean exist??",0,1753283923.0,pourover,5,0.43,False
1m7c1v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPRForYourSocialLife/comments/1m7c1v0/is_it_ok_to_not_have_friends/,Is It OK To NOT Have Friends?,"**by Patti Panara**

Fast answer: YES. Absolutely.

Because I’m a firm believer that people should live their lives in whatever way makes them feel comfortable, as long as they’re not hurting others. I think people spend too much time questioning how others live their lives and pressuring them to conform.
 
And Life is not a One-Size-Fits-All Recipe for success. That’s why we have monks, CEOS, cliff jumpers, average people, influencers and Squid Game. Because everyone’s different, and there’s no need to attempt to do what everyone else is doing (unless you want to).
So with that out of the way, I’d say there are some strong arguments for HAVING friends in order to have a better life. Does that mean you need a billion zillion of them, and you need to be texting them constantly and liking their social media all the time? NO. That isn’t what true friendship is about.

True friendship is this. Someone who:

*	Has your back
*	Cares about you
*	Shows up through thick and thin
*	Doesn’t judge you
*	Gives advice when you ASK for it
*	LIKES you!
*	Feels connected to you
*	Is curious about you and your life
*	Is down to do “whatever” if they’re free

That’s a (probably incomplete) definition of a good friend. And I will tell you THIS – if you feel your life is filled with a bunch of acquaintances, or “kinda sorta” friends, or people whom you’re “friendly with” but not necessarily FRIENDS with, then you may be feeling a bit of a friend-deficit.

Because of this: ONE good friend is more important than a planet filled with friendly acquaintances.  That’s literally the social math on that. And if you’ve never had a good friend, or haven’t had one in a while, I’m here to tell you that one good friend makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

It makes the world glow a different color for you. Because a good friend supports you and helps you recognize your own worth in a way you can’t do on your own. And it gives you a chance to show your BEST SELF to this person, and helps you grow your own friendship skills and habits.

So when people tell me they “need a friend group” I tell them “NO. You need a FRIEND. Start there.” Because once you have a friend, it’s much easier to get more of them, and even grow a group of them if you want to. But trying to “enter a friend group” often ends in acquiring a bunch of friendly acquaintances who fail to check in or tell you about the important things.

How does one go about acquiring a good friend? Good friends don’t just grow on trees, right? Otherwise we’d just pick a few and be done with it!
 
Well to continue the metaphor from the plant world, I’d say it’s more like growing a plant from scratch. First you find the right soil – that means places where you can FIND potential friends. Hint: Usually they’re not found at places such as one-off chance encounters like coffeeshops, concerts, public transportation or sitting on a park bench. I mean it CAN happen (especially in the movies), but it usually DOESN’T. Reason: not enough time to get to know the person. And few people want to take a chance on a total stranger. 

So your Friendship Growing Soil is more likely to be places like: where you live (neighborhood, condo/apt complex); at your job (including areas you have access to); school; sports teams; activities; hobbies; interest groups; volunteer work; exercise class – basically anyplace where you see people REGULARLY and can strike up REGULAR conversations.
 
Procedure: (This is 'planting the seeds' of friendship) introduce yourself, get the person’s name, ask a quick question, drop a bit of info about yourself. Eventually say good-bye to the person (ideally using their name), mention how it was GREAT to meet them. At future times be sure to greet them again, have a least a brief convo, maybe ask another question, and be friendly. (more on what ‘friendly’ looks down below) When you talk about yourself, give them something to GRAB ONTO. Like mention: where you went/go to school, a pet that you have, where you like to eat, a casual interest (without going too deep), vacation plans, what you do for exercise, what you binge watch. Give them something to LATCH ONTO and develop a conversation. 

Friendship Vibes: There are a number of things that will make you APPEALING to future friends. The reason this is important is that people are busy, they have friends already, and there are more than eight billion people on the planet. There needs to be something about you that stands out a bit that would make them want to be YOUR friend. Right? Doesn’t that make sense?

I’m NOT saying you have to be “perfect at everything.” Nobody needs to be perfect, and it’s sort of annoying when they are. But if you have a lot of positive traits, people will LOVE YOU in spite of any imperfections. In fact, they may view your imperfections as a charming part of what makes you YOU. So, on to the positive traits. (This is what you use to ""water"" your friendship soil.)
 
#Traits That Give Positive Friendship Vibes

**Confidence:** This obviously is a challenge if you don’t already have it, but I’d like you to consider it in a different light. You don’t need to be confident that you’re awesome and great at everything. (in fact that sounds kinda like an obnoxious friend, tbh!) You need to be confident that you know what to do socially and that you’re BRINGING GOOD THINGS TO PEOPLE. Knowing ‘what to do socially’ is a matter of practicing the things I’m going to mention. And ‘bringing good things’ means both doing a daily ‘random act of kindness’ and bringing the other traits mentioned on this list.

**Enthusiasm:** This is a trait that is lacking in a LOT of people. But I challenged you to start noticing some of the friendliest and most charismatic people you know. THEY bring this trait! One way to develop this is to work on gratitude for all the things you have but take for granted. A second way is to start talking with more excitement in your tone. PRACTICE this when you’re home alone! Talk to your: mirror, pet, houseplant, self. Do it in the car, the shower, the basement, the outdoors. You HAVE to get used to the sound of your own voice being more excited about life!

**Playfulness:** This isn’t about telling jokes or trying to entertain people. It’s about having a relaxed attitude, not taking life too seriously, and being ready to laugh and be a good audience. Tease people about what they’re GOOD at, not what they’re bad at.

**Positivity:** Complaining and looking at the dark side is a bad habit, one we often don’t even realize we have. That doesn’t mean you need to tip over into toxic positivity (pretending everything’s great when it obviously isn’t.) Reaching for the positive and re-framing the negative is a great way to improve your outlook, your life and ability to make friends.

**Warmth:** This is a trait people recognize when they see it, but often fail to realize how they can do it themselves. Basically it’s a tone that I call the “Vocal Hug.” This means talking to people with a glow that just invites them in. Picture how we talk to dogs and cats, or to toddlers. We HAVE to talk with warmth to them because they don’t understand most of our words. So we embrace them with our tone of voice. No, you don’t need to make this silly, but pushing warmth into your tone is the quickest way to make people feel comfortable. Practice it DAILY and watch people’s attitudes toward you change!

You don't need to be great at all of these things immediately. Pick one or two and focus on those. Work on these traits as often as you can. I suggest practicing in brief encounters you have daily that you don’t normally put much effort into. With people like: grocery cashiers, bus drivers, coffee servers, gym attendants, bank tellers, security guards, store clerks, food service people etc. 

So bring your best traits and have regular conversations with people in the spots you’ve identified above. Keep having those convos and develop a rapport with them over a period of weeks. Then eventually you need to INVITE them to do something with you outside the place where you know them from. So if you know them from class, it’s time to suggest someplace else on campus like studying together, getting something to eat or going to the gym or an activity. If you know them from work, then invite them to lunch, or shopping, or a movie or an after-work snack. If you know them from the neighborhood see if they want to walk, or do an errand, or hang out on your porch or do some shopping. Or videogames, or a hike, or something else outdoorsy.
 
If you’re feeling uncertain about the “invitation” aspect, then make it more casual like a suggestion. “Hey, I’m going to Le Café for some coffee after this. Wanna come?”

They might not say ‘yes’ the first time, but it’s a great way to let someone know you enjoy talking to them and would love to get to know them better. 

This is how friendships get their start! After that you check in with them briefly via text a couple times a week, and try to do something with them a couple times a month.

Then BE a good friend to them! And watch your life start to glow with a brighter shine.

1m7c0c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m7c0c5/why_choose_the_bunn_mcu_singleserve_brewer_for/,Why Choose the BUNN MCU Single-Serve Brewer for Coffee and Tea?,"Making mornings smoother is one thing, but the BUNN MCU 42900.0501 excels at transforming them into delightful caffeine-fueled experiences. As someone who has tested and explored dozens of coffee makers over the years, this multi-use single-serve brewer stood out for its versatility, efficiency, and flavor delivery. BUNN’s reputation for dependable coffee brewing machines holds firm here, but of course, no product is without its quirks. Below, let’s dig into all the good, the not-so-good, and everything in between.

**Design and Functionality**  
Right out of the box, the sleek, modern design of this single-serve brewer might grab your attention. I placed it on my countertop, and its compact dimensions (10.1""D x 7.2""W x 12.1""H) made it a great fit without hogging too much space. The black and stainless steel finish felt both contemporary and durable. Using it daily, I appreciated its button-operated interface—it’s straightforward and doesn’t involve any learning curve. Overall, its no-nonsense layout left little room for confusion.

**Performance That Packs a Punch**  
Brewing coffee with this machine is an efficient, tailored experience. Unlike some universal brewers that can feel like they’re just getting the job done, this one seemed to cater specifically to my caffeine whims. With options for K-Cups, loose tea, ground coffee, or soft pods, making tea, hot chocolate, or espresso was effortless. The internal stainless-steel hot water tank holds water at optimal extraction temperature (ready in under a minute!), and honestly, the boldness of flavor that came through was a game-changer. The pulse-brew feature? That’s not just marketing fluff—it genuinely slowed the brewing process to extract more richness when I used stronger blends.

**Perks**  
- Brewed coffee in under a minute, saving me precious time on hectic mornings.  
- Compatible with K-Cups, ground coffee, and tea options made it versatile for everyone in the household.  
- Adjustable volumes let me brew for just myself or a travel mug effortlessly.  
- Built-in pre-soak and spray head system meant the flavor extraction from all coffee and tea types was consistent.  

[Check BUNN MCU 42900.0501 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b08v96t69c/)  

**Drawbacks**  
Not everything shines without casting a shadow. While this brewer excelled in most categories, the loud brewing operation was hard to ignore—especially if quiet mornings are sacred in your household. Another hitch was its water tank, which needed frequent refills if you’re making multiple cups, and cleaning the reusable filter drawer sometimes felt like a chore.  

- Noise levels might disturb quieter settings.  
- Refilling the water tank often disrupts brewing multiple servings.  
- Cleaning reusable sections regularly takes effort.  

**Ease of Use and Features**  
This coffee maker doesn’t complicate the process. Pour water in the easily accessible bowl, select your brew configuration, and press the button—done. The water tank’s level indicators are conveniently visible and user-friendly. The versatility of included parts, like the K-Cup drawer and tea bag drawer, quickly validated its claim of being a multi-purpose brewer. One morning, I switched from an earthy oolong tea to a dark roast coffee using the same machine—all in minutes. Bonus points for the pulse brewing button enabling stronger extraction for an extra kick!

**Operational Mode – Fully Automatic**  
After testing several appliances I’d describe as semi-manual nightmares, this fully automatic setup felt like a relief. It’s engineered for minimal error: the water you pour dictates the exact serving size, so no fretting over measurements. If you’re skeptical about transitioning to an automatic brewer, it bridges convenience with control seamlessly. While manual purists might sneer, my household was thrilled by how efficient it made things.

**Competitive Options**  
I couldn’t resist stacking this machine up against popular contenders like the Keurig K-Elite and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. Compared to Keurig, the BUNN MCU won in extraction time and flavor depth—but Keurig still edges ahead in reservoir size and quieter operation. Hamilton Beach FlexBrew matched this brewer’s versatility closely, but BUNN’s pulse brew button pulled it ahead for delivering richer final results. If silent brewing or larger water tanks make or break your coffee routine, exploring these alternatives might be worth it.  

**Smart Spending**  
This coffee maker resides in a middle-ground price range where both budget-conscious buyers and coffee enthusiasts will find value. Paying for customizable features, multi-functionality, and quality builds feels justified. Price-sensitive buyers may hesitate compared to basic drip brewers, but anyone seeking consistency and control should feel this investment is warranted. Versatility and performance successfully deliver ample “bang for the buck.”

Having tested various coffee machines over the years, I can say this one does stand out for those living in apartments or anyone with limited counter space. At less than 5 inches wide, it felt like it was almost built to fit perfectly into that awkward little corner on my kitchen counter. The matte white exterior added a sophisticated touch to my relatively simple kitchen setup without being too ostentatious. Plus, it’s portable, which made it handy to bring to my sister’s house for a weekend of chatter and coffee.

**Ease of Use and Customization**

Operating this little marvel is ridiculously straightforward. Add water to the removable one-cup reservoir, pop in a K-Cup pod, and press the brew button. That’s it. You don’t need a degree in engineering to figure it out, which was a significant relief for me since I’m trying to move away from overly complicated coffee makers. The option to choose brew sizes between 6-12oz was neat, especially for mornings where I needed that “extra-large” cup of fuel. For those who prefer an intense flavor profile, like my caffeine-fiend of a coworker, the Strong Brew button was a welcome addition to achieve a bolder kick.

**Check [Keurig 611247386125] price on Amazon.**  

**Storage and Portability**

The built-in pod storage was a fantastic space-saver, capable of holding up to 9 pods. Perfect for someone like me who’s almost always juggling limited pantry shelves. Its cord storage, while seemingly a small feature, turned out to be a game-changer for keeping my counter neat. I found the Keurig especially useful on a camping trip where the cord could be tucked securely during transit, keeping it out of the way amidst other gear.

**Advantages**

- Simplifies brewing with one-touch operation.
- Compact design fits even in tight spaces.
- The portable reservoir and cord storage enhance mobility.
- Brew-strength control for more coffee flavor intensity.  

**Durability and Maintenance**

Being a long-term user of coffee makers, I know how much abuse these machines go through over time. The removable reservoir of this brewer was easy to clean and didn’t accumulate the stubborn water stains some other models tend to. The drip tray accommodated travel mugs up to 7 inches tall, which was great for those mornings when I was running late and had to gulp my coffee on-the-go. It was a lifesaver for accidental spills, too. Once, my nephew decided to play barista and forgot to put a mug under the spout. The tray held every drop without a fuss, making the cleanup effortless.

**Perks**

- Quick-cup brewing ideal for a fast-paced morning routine.
- Travel mug-friendly removable drip tray prevents spills.
- Matte finish resists fingerprint smudges.  

**Areas of Improvement**

I did come across a few hiccups, though. For one, the single-cup reservoir works just fine for occasional uses but can get a bit tedious on days where multiple coffees back-to-back are needed. A larger, non-removable reservoir might have been more convenient for high-frequency use. Additionally, while brewing time was fast, the machine was slightly noisier than I anticipated—nothing intolerable, but certainly noisy enough to wake light sleepers in the house.

**Critiques**

- Single-cup reservoir requires frequent refilling for multiple brews.
- Slightly loud brewing process.  

**Competing Brands**

Having used Nespresso machines in the past, the Keurig K-Mini Plus felt similar in terms of ease of operation but was far more compact. Nespresso models often cater to espresso-specific preferences, which makes them great for a different kind of coffee drinker. Meanwhile, Keurig’s broader compatibility with tea and cocoa sets it apart. Regarding build quality, I did notice that some competing brands offer smoother mechanisms for pod insertion compared to this version. On the other hand, the removable reservoir here trumped many competitors as it’s incredibly easy to clean and refill.

**Cost Efficiency**

For its features and portability, this brewer hits a sweet spot. It brings value in the form of space-saving innovation and robust performance. I love that I didn’t have to compromise on quality while getting something so compact. Given that many competitors charge a premium for similar compact designs without adding features like cord storage or a Strong Brew button, I felt this model provided excellent bang for the buck.

1m7byt4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m7byt4,Advice for a coffee newbie,"Hey everyone,

I’ve recently gotten into pour over coffee and have been slowly upgrading my setup over time. I started off using a spice grinder and pre-ground coffee from cafes, but now I’ve moved up to using the Fellow Ode Gen 2 grinder, fresh whole beans, a Hario V60, a gooseneck kettle, and a scale/timer setup. Overall, I’m pretty happy with my gear now.

Lately, I’ve been trying different brewing techniques and experimenting with brew times, but I haven’t really stuck to a consistent method. I also feel like I haven’t developed much of a palate yet — I struggle to identify specific flavor notes beyond the basics, and I find it hard to tell what makes one coffee stand out from another.

I recently visited Special Guests in London, and they had a menu with 12 different beans. Honestly, I had no idea what to look for or what questions to ask. I just told them I liked something “juicier” and went with their recommendation (which was great, by the way!).

Now that I’ve got a solid setup at home, I want to focus on improving my tasting ability.

So my questions are:
	•	How can I start to train my palate and better understand different flavor profiles?
	•	What should I be looking for (or asking) when buying beans or visiting a specialty café?

Would love to hear how others got started with this part of the journey. Thanks!

  Alex hurried across the wide, alien plane of Beinecke Plaza, boots thudding over flat squares of clean concrete. The giant cube of the rare-books collection seemed to float above its lower story. During the day its panels glowed amber, a burnished golden hive, less a library than a temple. At night it just looked like a tomb. This part of campus didn’t quite fit with the rest of Yale—no gray stone or Gothic arches, no rebellious little outcroppings of red-brick buildings, which Darlington had explained were not actually Colonial but only meant to look that way. He’d explained the reasons for the way Beinecke had been built, the way it was supposed to mirror and slot into this corner of the campus architecture, but it still felt like a seventies sci-fi movie to her, like the students should all be wearing unitards or too-short tunics, drinking something called the Extract, eating food in pellets. Even the big metal sculpture that she now knew was by Alexander Calder reminded her of a giant lava lamp in negative.  
  
  “It’s Calder,” she murmured beneath her breath. That was the way people here talked about art. Nothing was by anyone. The sculpture is Calder. The painting is Rothko. The house is Neutra.  
  
  And Alex was late. She had begun the night with good intentions, determined to get ahead of her Modern British Novel essay and leave with plenty of time to make it to the prognostication. But she’d fallen asleep in one of the Sterling Library reading rooms, a copy of Nostromo gripped loosely in her hand, feet propped on a heating duct. At half past ten, she’d woken with a start, drool trickling across her cheek. Her startled “Shit!” had gone off like a shotgun blast in the quiet of the library, and she’d buried her face in her scarf as she slung her bag over her shoulder and made her escape.  
  
  Now she cut through Commons, beneath the rotunda where the names of the war dead were carved deep into the marble, and stone figures stood vigil—Peace, Devotion, Memory, and finally Courage, who wore a helmet and shield and little else and had always looked to Alex more like a stripper than a mourner. She charged down the steps and across the intersection of College and Grove.  
  
  The campus had a way of changing faces from hour to hour and block to block so that Alex always felt as if she were meeting it for the first time. Tonight it was a sleepwalker, breathing deep and even. The people she passed on her way to SSS seemed locked in a dream, soft-eyed, faces turned to one another, steam rising off the cups of coffee in their gloved hands. She had the eerie sense that they were dreaming her, a girl in a dark coat who would disappear when they woke.  
  
  Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall was drowsing too, the classrooms closed up tight, hallways cast in energy-saving half-light. Alex took the stairs to the second floor and heard noise echoing from one of the lecture halls. The Yale Social screened movies there every Thursday night. Mercy had tacked the schedule to the door of their dorm room, but Alex hadn’t bothered to study it. Her Thursdays were full.  
  
  Tripp Helmuth slouched against the wall beside the doors to the lecture hall. He acknowledged Alex with a heavy-lidded nod. Even in the dim light, she could see his eyes were bloodshot. No doubt he’d smoked before he showed up tonight. Maybe that was why the elder Bonesmen had stuck him on guard duty. Or maybe he’d volunteered.  
  
  “You’re late,” he said. “They started.”  
  
  Alex ignored him, glanced once over her shoulder to make sure the hallway was clear. She didn’t owe Tripp Helmuth an excuse, and it would look weak to offer one. She pressed her thumb into a barely visible notch in the paneling. The wall was supposed to swing open smoothly, but it always stuck. She gave it a hard nudge with her shoulder and stumbled as it jolted open.  
  
  “Easy, killer,” said Tripp.  
  
  Alex shut the door behind her and edged down the narrow passage in the dark.  
  
  Unfortunately, Tripp was right. The prognostication had already begun. Alex entered the old operating theater as quietly as she could.  
  
  The room was a windowless chamber, sandwiched between the lecture hall and a classroom that grad students used for discussion sections. It was a forgotten remnant of the old medical school, which had held its classes here in SSS before it moved to its own buildings. The managers of the trust that funded Skull and Bones had sealed up the room’s entrance and disguised it with new paneling sometime around 1932. All facts Alex had gleaned from Lethe: A Legacy when she probably should have been reading Nostromo.  
  
  No one spared Alex a glance. All eyes were on the Haruspex, his lean face hidden behind a surgical mask, pale blue robes spattered with blood. His latex-gloved hands moved methodically through the bowels of the—patient? Subject? Sacrifice? Alex wasn’t sure which term applied to the man on the table. Not “sacrifice.” He’s supposed to live. Ensuring that was part of her job. She’d see him safely through this ordeal and back to the hospital ward he’d been taken from. But what about a year from now? she wondered. Five years from now?  
  
  Alex glanced at the man on the table: Michael Reyes. She’d read his file two weeks ago, when he was selected for the ritual. The flaps of his stomach were pinned back with steel clips and his abdomen looked like it was blooming, a plump pink orchid, plush and red at its center. Tell me that doesn’t leave a mark. But she had her own future to worry about. Reyes would manage.  
  
  Alex averted her eyes, tried to breathe through her nose as her stomach roiled and coppery saliva flooded her mouth. She’d seen plenty of bad injuries but always on the dead. There was something much worse about a living wound, a human body tethered to life by nothing but the steady metallic beep of a monitor. She had candied ginger in her pocket for nausea—one of Darlington’s tips—but she couldn’t quite bring herself to take it out and unwrap it.  
  
  Instead, she focused her gaze on some middle distance as the Haruspex called out a series of numbers and letters—stock symbols and share prices for companies traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange. Later in the night he’d move on to the NASDAQ, Euronext, and the Asian markets. Alex didn’t bother trying to decipher them. The orders to buy, sell, or hold were given in impenetrable Dutch, the language of commerce, the first stock exchange, old New York, and the official language of the Bonesmen. When Skull and Bones was founded, too many students knew Greek and Latin. Their dealings had required something more obscure.  
  
  “Dutch is harder to pronounce,” Darlington had told her. “Besides, it gives the Bonesmen an excuse to visit Amsterdam.” Of course, Darlington knew Latin, Greek, and Dutch. He also spoke French, Mandarin, and passable Portuguese. Alex had just started Spanish II. Between the classes she’d taken in grade school and her grandmother’s mishmash of Ladino sayings, she’d thought it would be an easy grade.  
She hadn’t counted on things like the subjunctive. But she could just about ask if Gloria might like to go to the discotheque tomorrow night.  
  
  A burst of muffled gunfire rattled through the wall from the screening next door. The Haruspex looked up from the slick pink mess of Michael Reyes’s small intestine, his irritation apparent.  
  
  Scarface, Alex realized as the music swelled and a chorus of rowdy voices thundered in unison, “You wanna fuck with me? Okay. You wanna play rough?” The audience chanting along like it was Rocky Horror. She must have seen Scarface a hundred times. It was one of Len’s favorites. He was predictable that way, loved everything hard—as if he’d mailed away for a How to Be Gangster kit. When they’d met Hellie near the Venice boardwalk, her golden hair like a parted curtain for the theater of her big blue eyes, Alex had thought instantly of Michelle Pfeiffer in her satin shift. All she’d been missing was the smooth sheaf of bangs. But Alex didn’t want to think about Hellie tonight, not with the stink of blood in the air. Len and Hellie were her old life. They didn’t belong at Yale. Then again, neither did Alex.  
  
  Despite the memories, Alex was grateful for any noise that would cover the wet sounds of the Haruspex pawing through Michael Reyes’s gut. What did he see there? Darlington had said the prognostications were no different than someone reading the future in the cards of a tarot deck or a handful of animal bones. But it sure looked different. And sounded more specific. You’re missing someone. You will find happiness in the new year. Those were the kinds of things fortune-tellers said—vague, comforting.  
  
  Alex eyed the Bonesmen, robed and hooded, crowded around the body on the table, the undergrad Scribe taking down the predictions that would be passed on to hedge-fund managers and private investors all over the world to keep the Bonesmen and their alumni financially secure. Former presidents, diplomats, at least one director of the CIA—all of them Bonesmen. Alex thought of Tony Montana, soaking in his hot tub, speechifying: You know what capitalism is? Alex glanced at Michael Reyes’s prone body. Tony, you have no idea. She caught a flicker of movement from the benches that overlooked the operating arena. The theater had two local Grays who always sat in the same places, just a few rows apart: a female mental patient who’d had her ovaries and uterus removed in a hysterectomy in 1926, for which she would have been paid six dollars if she’d survived the procedure; and a male, a medical student. He’d frozen to death in an opium den thousands of miles away, sometime around 1880, but kept returning here to sit in his old seat and look down on whatever passed for life below. Prognostications only happened in the theater four times a year, at the start of each fiscal quarter, but that seemed to be enough to suit him.  
  
  Darlington liked to say that dealing with ghosts was like riding the subway: Do not make eye contact. Do not smile. Do not engage. Otherwise, you never know what might follow you home. Easier said than done when the only other thing to look at in the room was a man playing with another man’s innards like they were mah-jongg tiles.  
  
  She remembered Darlington’s shock when he’d realized she could not only see ghosts without the help of any potion or spell but see them in color. He’d been weirdly furious. She’d enjoyed that.  
  
  “What kinds of color?” he’d asked, sliding his feet off the coffee table, his heavy black boots thunking on the slatted floor of the parlor at Il Bastone.  
  
  “Just color. Like an old Polaroid. Why? What do you see?”  
  
  “They look gray,” he’d snapped. “That’s why they’re called Grays.”  
  
  She’d shrugged, knowing her nonchalance would make Darlington even angrier. “It isn’t a big deal.”  
  
  “Not to you,” he’d muttered, and stomped away. He’d spent the rest of the day in the training room, working up a cranky sweat.  
  
  She’d felt smug at the time, glad not everything came so easily to him. But now, moving in a circle around the perimeter of the theater, checking the little chalk markings made at every compass point, she just felt jittery and unprepared. That was the way she’d felt since she’d taken her first step on campus. No, before that. From the time Dean Sandow had sat down beside her hospital bed, tapped the handcuffs on her wrist with his nicotine-stained fingers, and said, “We are offering you an opportunity.” But that was the old Alex. The Alex of Hellie and Len. Yale Alex had never worn handcuffs, never gotten into a fight, never fucked a stranger in a bathroom to make up her boyfriend’s vig. Yale Alex struggled but didn’t complain. She was a good girl trying to keep up.  
  
  And failing. She should have been here early to observe the making of the signs and ensure the circle was secure. Grays as old as the ones hovering on the tiered benches above didn’t tend to make trouble even when drawn by blood, but prognostications were big magic and her job was to verify that the Bonesmen followed proper procedures, stayed cautious. She was playacting, though. She’d spent the previous night cramming, trying to memorize the correct signs and proportions of chalk, charcoal, and bone. She’d made flash cards, for fuck’s sake, and forced herself to shuffle through them in between bouts of Joseph Conrad.  
  
  Alex thought the markings looked okay, but she knew her signs of protection about as well as her modern British novels. When she’d attended the fall-quarter prognostication with Darlington, had she really paid attention? No. She’d been too busy sucking on ginger candy, reeling from the strangeness of it all, and praying she wouldn’t humiliate herself by puking. She’d thought she had plenty of time to learn with Darlington looking over her shoulder. But they’d both been wrong about that.  
  
  “Voorhoofd!” the Haruspex called, and one of the Bonesmen darted forward. Melinda? Miranda? Alex couldn’t remember the redhead’s name, only that she was in an all-female a cappella group called Whim ’n Rhythm. The girl patted the Haruspex’s forehead with a white cloth and melted back into the group.  
  
  Alex tried not to look at the man on the table, but her eyes darted to his face anyway. Michael Reyes, age forty-eight, diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. Would Reyes remember any of it when he woke? When he tried to tell someone would they just call him crazy? Alex knew exactly what that was like. It could be me on that table.  
  
  “The Bonesmen like them as nuts as possible,” Darlington had told her. “They think it makes for better predictions.” When she’d asked him why, he’d just said, “The crazier the victima, the closer to God.”  
  
  “Is that true?”  
  
  “It is only through mystery and madness that the soul is revealed,” he’d quoted. Then he’d shrugged. “Their bank balances say yes.”  
  
  “And we’re okay with this?” Alex had asked Darlington. “With people getting cut open so Chauncey can redecorate his summer home?”  
  
  “Never met a Chauncey,” he’d said. “Still hoping.” Then he’d paused, standing in the armory, his face grave. “Nothing is going to stop this. Too many powerful people rely on what the societies can do. Before Lethe existed, no one was keeping watch. So you can make futile bleating noises in protest and lose your scholarship, or you can stay here, do your job, and do the most good you can.”  
  
  Even then, she’d wondered if that was only part of the story, if Darlington’s desire to know everything bound him to Lethe just as surely as any sense of duty. But she’d stayed quiet then and she intended to stay quiet now.  
  
  Michael Reyes had been found in one of the public beds at Yale New Haven. To the outside world he looked like any other patient: a vagrant, the type who passed through psych wards and emergency rooms and jails, on his meds, then off. He had a brother in New Jersey who was listed as his next of kin and who had signed off on what was supposed to be a routine medical procedure for the treatment of a scarred bowel.  
  
  Reyes was cared for solely by a nurse named Jean Gatdula, who’d worked three night shifts in a row. She didn’t blink or cause a fuss when, through what appeared to be a scheduling error, she was slated for two more evenings in the ward. That week her colleagues may or may not have noticed that she always came to work with a huge handbag. In it was stowed a little cooler that she used to carry Michael Reyes’s meals: a dove’s heart for clarity, geranium root, and a dish of bitter herbs. Gatdula had no idea what the food did or what fate awaited Michael Reyes any more than she knew what became of any of the “special” patients she tended to. She didn’t even know whom she worked for, only that once every month she received a much-needed check to offset the gambling debts her husband racked up at the Foxwoods blackjack tables.  
  
  Alex wasn’t sure if it was her imagination or if she really could smell the ground parsley speckling Reyes’s insides, but her own stomach gave another warning flutter. She was desperate for fresh air, sweating beneath her layers. The operating theater was kept ice cold, fed by vents separate from the rest of the building, but the huge portable halogens used to light the proceedings still radiated heat.  
  
  A low moan sounded. Alex’s gaze shot to Michael Reyes, a terrible image flashing through her mind: Reyes waking to find himself strapped to a table, surrounded by hooded figures, his insides on the outside. But his eyes were closed, his chest rising and falling in steady rhythm. The moan continued, louder now. Maybe someone else was feeling sick? But none of the Bonesmen looked distressed. Their faces glowed like studious moons in the dim theater, eyes trained on the proceedings.  
  
  Still the moan climbed, a low wind building, churning through the room and bouncing off its dark-wood walls. No direct eye contact, Alex warned herself. Just look to see if the Grays—She choked back a startled grunt.  
  
  The Grays were no longer in their seats.  
  
  They leaned over the railing that surrounded the operating theater, fingers gripping the wood, necks craned, their bodies stretching toward the very edge of the chalk circle like animals straining to drink from the lip of a watering hole.  
  
  Don’t look. It was Darlington’s voice, his warning. Don’t look too closely. It was too easy for a Gray to form a bond, to attach itself to you. And it was more dangerous because she already knew these Grays’ histories. They had been around so long that generations of Lethe delegates had document  
ed their pasts. But their names had been redacted from all documents.  
  
  “If you don’t know a name,” Darlington had explained, “you can’t think it, and then you won’t be tempted to say it.” A name was a kind of intimacy.  
  
  Don’t look. But Darlington wasn’t here.  
  
  The female Gray was naked, her small breasts puckered from the cold as they must have been in death. She lifted a hand to the open wound of her belly, touched the flesh there fondly, like a woman coyly indicating that she was expecting. They hadn’t sewn her up. The boy—and he was a boy, skinny and tender-featured—wore a sloppy bottle-green jacket and stained trousers. Grays always appeared as they had in the moment of death. But there was something obscene about them side by side, one naked, the other clothed.  
  
  Every muscle in the Grays’ bodies strained, their eyes wide and staring, their lips yawning open. The black holes of their mouths were caverns, and from them that bleak keening rose, not really a moan at all but something flat and inhuman. Alex thought of the wasps’ nest she’d found in the garage beneath her mother’s Studio City apartment one summer, the mindless buzz of insects in a dark place.  
  
  The Haruspex kept reciting in Dutch. Another Bonesman held a glass of water to the Scribe’s lips as he continued his transcriptions. The smell of blood and herbs and shit hung dense in the air.  
  
  The Grays arced forward inch by inch, trembling, lips distended, their mouths too wide now, as if their jaws had unhinged. The whole room seemed to vibrate.  
  
  But only Alex could see them.  
  
  That was why Lethe had brought her here, why Dean Sandow had grudgingly made his golden offer to a girl in handcuffs. Still, Alex looked around, hoping for someone else to understand, for anyone to offer their help.  
  
  She took a step back, heart rabbiting in her chest. Grays were docile, vague, especially Grays this old. At least Alex thought they were. Was this one of the lessons Darlington hadn’t gotten to yet?  
  
  She racked her brain for the few incantations Darlington had taught her last semester, spells of protection. She could use death words in a pinch. Would they work on Grays in this state? She should have put salt in her pockets, caramels to distract them, anything. Basic stuff, Darlington said in her head. Easy to master.  
  
  The wood beneath the Grays’ fingers began to bend and creak. Now the redheaded a cappella girl looked up, wondering where the creaking had come from.  
  
  The wood was going to splinter. The signs must have been made incorrectly; the circle of protection would not hold. Alex looked right and left at the useless Bonesmen in their ridiculous robes. If Darlington were here, he would stay and fight, make sure the Grays were contained and Reyes was kept safe.  
  
  The halogens dimmed, surged.  
  
  “Fuck you, Darlington,” Alex muttered beneath her breath, already turning on her heel to run.  
  
  Boom.  
  
  The room shook. Alex stumbled. The Haruspex and the rest of the Bonesmen looked at her, scowling.  
  
  Boom.  
  
  The sound of something knocking from the next world. Something big. Something that should not be let through.  
  
  “Is our Dante drunk?” muttered the Haruspex.  
  
  Boom.  
  
  Alex opened her mouth to scream, to tell them to run before whatever was holding that thing back gave way.  
  
  The moaning dropped away suddenly, completely, as if stoppered in a bottle. The monitor beeped. The lights hummed.  
  
  The Grays were back in their seats, ignoring each other, ignoring her.  
  
  Beneath her coat, Alex’s blouse clung wetly to her, soaked through with sweat. She could smell her own sour fear thick on her skin. The halogens still shone hot and white. The theater pulsed heat like an organ suffused with blood. The Bonesemen were staring. Next door, the credits rolled.  
  
  Alex could see the spot where the Grays had gripped the railing, white slivers of wood splayed like corn silk.  
  
  “Sorry,” Alex said. She bent at the knees and vomited onto the stone floor.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  When they finally stitched up Michael Reyes, it was nearly 3 a.m. The Haruspex and most of the other Bonesmen had left hours before to shower off the ritual and prepare for a party that would last well past dawn.  
  
  The Haruspex might head directly back to New York in the creamy leather seat of a black town car, or he might stay for the festivities and take his pick of willing undergrad girls or boys or both. She’d been told “attending to” the Haruspex was considered an honor, and Alex supposed if you were high enough and drunk enough, it might feel like that was the case, but it sure sounded like being pimped out to the man who paid the bills.  
  
  The redhead—Miranda, it turned out, “like in The Tempest”—had helped Alex clean up the vomit. She’d been genuinely nice about it and Alex had almost felt bad for not remembering her name.  
  
  Reyes had been transported out of the building on a gurney, cloaked in obfuscation veils that made him look like a bunch of AV equipment piled beneath protective plastic sheeting. It was the most risky part of the whole night’s endeavor as far as the safety of the society went. Skull and Bones didn’t really excel at anything other than prognostication, and of course the members of Manuscript weren’t interested in sharing their glamours with another society. The magic binding Reyes’s veils wobbled with every bump, the gurney coming into and out of focus, the blips and bleeps from the medical equipment and the ventilator still audible. If anyone stopped to take a close look at what was being wheeled down the hallway, the Bonesmen would have some real trouble—though Alex doubted it would be anything they couldn’t buy their way out of.  
  
  She would check in on Reyes once he was back on the ward and then again in a week to make sure he was healing without complications. There had been casualties following prognostications before, though only one since Lethe had been founded in 1898 to monitor the societies. A group of Bonesmen had accidentally killed a vagrant during a hastily planned emergency reading after the stock-market crash of 1929. Prognostications had been banned for the next four years, and Bones had been threatened with the loss of its massive red stone tomb on High Street. “That’s why we exist,” Darlington had said as Alex turned the pages listing the names of each victima and prognostication date in the Lethe records. “We are the shepherds, Stern.”  
  
  But he’d cringed when Alex pointed to an inscription in one of the margins of Lethe: A Legacy. “NMDH?”  
  
  “No more dead hobos,” he’d said on a sigh.  
  
  So much for the noble mission of Lethe House. Still Alex couldn’t feel too superior tonight, not when she’d been seconds from abandoning Michael Reyes to save her own ass.  
  
  Alex endured a long string of jokes about her spewed dinner of grilled chicken and Twizzlers, and stayed at the theater to make sure the remaining Bonesmen followed what she hoped was proper procedure for sanitizing the space.  
  
  She promised herself she’d return later to sprinkle the theater with bone dust. Reminders of death were the best way to keep Grays at bay. It was why cemeteries were some of the least haunted places in the world. She thought of the ghosts’ open mouths, that horrible drone of insects. Something had been trying to slam its way into the chalk circle. At least that was how it had seemed. Grays—ghosts—were harmless. Mostly. It took a lot for them to take any kind of form in the mortal world. And to pass through the final Veil? To become physical, capable of touch? Capable of damage? They could. Alex knew they could. But it was close to impossible.  
  
  Even so, there had been hundreds of prognostications in this theater and she’d never heard of any Grays crossing over into physical form or interfering. Why had their behavior changed tonight?  
  
  If it had.  
  
  The greatest gift Lethe had given Alex was not the full ride to Yale, the new start that had scrubbed her past clean like a chemical burn. It was the knowledge, the certainty, that the things she saw were real and always had been. But she’d lived too long wondering if she was crazy to stop now. Darlington would have believed her. He always had. Except Darlington was gone.  
  
&  
nbsp; Not for good, she told herself. In a week the new moon would rise and they would bring him home.  
  
  Alex touched her fingers to the cracked railing, already thinking about how to phrase her description of the prognostication for the Lethe House records. Dean Sandow reviewed all of them, and she wasn’t anxious to draw his attention to anything out of the ordinary. Besides, if you set aside a helpless man having his guts rearranged, nothing bad had actually happened.  
  
  When Alex emerged from the passage into the hallway, Tripp Helmuth startled from his slouch. “They almost done in there?”  
  
  Alex nodded and took a deep breath of comparatively fresh air, eager to get outside.  
  
  “Pretty gross, huh?” Tripp asked with a smirk. “If you want I can slip you some of the tips when they get transcribed. Take the edge off those student loans.”  
  
  “What the fuck would you know about student loans?” The words were out before she could stop them. Darlington would not approve. Alex was supposed to remain civil, distant, diplomatic. And anyway, she was a hypocrite. Lethe had made sure she would graduate without a cloud of debt hanging over her—if she actually made it through four years of exams and papers and nights like these.  
  
  Tripp held his hands up in surrender, laughing uneasily. “Hey, just tryin’ to get by.” Tripp was on the sailing team, a third-generation Bonesman, a gentleman and a scholar, a purebred golden retriever—dopey, glossy, and expensive. He was rumpled and rosy as a healthy infant, his hair sandy, his skin still tan from whichever island he’d spent winter break on. He had the ease of someone who had always been and would always be just fine, a boy of a thousand second chances. “We good?” he asked eagerly.  
  
  “We’re good,” she said, though she was not good at all. She could still feel the reverberation of that buzzing moan filling up her lungs, rattling the inside of her skull. “Just stuffy in there.”

Starting to get to me...,"This has happened to me so often... have u noticed how when you're walking down the street, the only time strangers stop you is to ask for something... money for charity, some product, a petition… whatever.. and when I say, “sorry I don’t have any money” they reply “oh we take card! Look here's our contactless card machine!!!” Like… what? Which part of ""I don't have any money"" do you not understand - do you think having a card machine magically gives me money I don’t have? I’m broke. I'm struggling. And yet nobody ever stops you just to be kind, have a chat, or offer a coffee. If you're poor, people don’t *give* you anything... they just ignore you & move on to the next target. What happened to basic humanity?

People in my area (in London) seem to volunteer to do those jobs (stopping strangers to ask for money) without realising they might actually be doing more harm than good.. for every person they guilt into donating, there are dozens more they leave feeling worse about themselves for not being able to afford to give anything. A huge chunk of those donations likely ends up funding salaries for people at the top of the charity instead of helping those in need. Ironically... if these volunteers just worked a normal job for the same amount of time and donated the money THEY EARN directly to those in need, they’d probably make a bigger difference financially (and without making poor people feel worse along the way!)

Btw, I stop strangers to ask if they'd like a coffee chat at a local cafe to try to counter-act this negativity & I'd like to suggest everyone else do the same! Fight back this selfishness with kindness... sadly a lot say no because they think I'm trying to trick them or ask for money, but I won't stop injecting the world with kindness like this... please, if you have courage do the same & maybe we can change the world... one small step at a time...",7,1753283589.0,Life,14,1.0,False
1m7bwv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1m7bwv1/overwhelmed_no_idea_where_to_begin/,"Overwhelmed, no idea where to begin.","Hey there. I'm trying to, well, not die in the near future of some cardiac issue, as well as feeling better about myself in general. 

I'm 43 years old, used to be reasonably fit up until age 20, and then due to a few medical issues basically became lazy. I could make excuses, and i certainly feel like making excuses, but in the end, the driving factor of getting bigger and bigger was simply, food is great and not moving is comfy. Now, for medical issues, my knees are shot - i can't, for example, do squats. I can get down, but i can't get up due to savage pain in the knees. That also ruled out jogging and even biking, things of that sort. That includes the rowing machine (tried at a friends place - anything that requires me to put weight or torque on the knees won't work). 

Recently though, my dad had a heart attack, and it was a bit of a wake up call - being big, and basically only moving to walk to the car and back, i'm on the right track to join that club by age 50. 

So, i started dieting. Without real plan, really - i tend to batch cook for myself, currently i'm living on one portion of ""Kappes"" (a german dish, basically cabbage, mince, caraway seed etc) with half a cup of Quinoa a day, plus a coffee in the morning - rest water. I actually did achieve some weight loss (231lbs to 208lbs, i'm 185cm, BMI of 28), but while i am losing weight slowly, there's other things i need to tackle - like my weak lower back. After 20 years of sitting and barely moving, particularly my lower back aches from basically everything, and i can tell that it's from weakness. 

So, decision made, i gotta start working on that. But here's why i'm writing: this is overwhelming. As someone who has no clue about fitness, it's hard to see through the jungle of 100s of thousands of pages, all claiming to be beginner friendly - i got no idea what's healthy and what isn't recommended etc. 

Is there a ""definitive"" page for absolute beginners like me, for some home exercises (for reference, i manage a whopping 4-5 50% push ups - the ones with knees on the ground) - or more importantly, like a full months program that i can just follow? I'm not a fitness buff, and i likely never will be - i do this because i need to do this, and it's demotivating to look at the screen trying to figure out what i should do over 4 weeks, because i don't understand most of it. 

Where do i need to look for comprehensive, one month long programs that i can follow. I don't want to create programs (more so, i don't have the knowledge to so in the first place), i don't want to go to the Gym (i live rural, closest gym is like an hours drive away) - i don't even want to get a six pack or be all muscle-y and whatnot. I just want to be averagely healthy, and not getting back pain from carrying the groceries up some stairs.

  RHEN  
  
  There is blood under my fingernails. I wonder how many of my people I’ve killed this time.  
  
  I thrust my hands into the barrel beside the stables. The ice-cold water bites at my skin, but the blood clings. I shouldn’t bother, because it will all be gone in an hour anyway, but I hate this. The blood. The not knowing.  
  
  Hooves ring against the cobblestones somewhere behind me, followed by the jingle of a horse’s bridle.  
  
  I don’t need to look. My guard commander always follows at a safe distance until the transition is complete.  
  
  Guard commander. As if Grey has men left to command.  
  
  As if he didn’t earn the title by default.  
  
  I swipe the water from my hands and turn. Grey stands a few yards back, holding the reins of Ironheart, the fastest horse in the stables. The animal is blowing hard, its chest and flanks damp with sweat despite the early-morning chill.  
  
  For as long as we’ve been trapped here, Grey’s appearance is somehow a continual surprise. He looks as young as the day he earned a position in the elite Royal Guard, his dark hair slightly unkempt, his face unlined. His uniform still fits him well, every buckle and strap perfectly arranged, every weapon shining in the near darkness.  
  
  He once carried a gleam of eagerness in his eye, a spark for adventure. For challenge.  
  
  That gleam has long since gone dark, the only aspect of his appearance that is never remade by the curse.  
  
  I wonder if my unchanged appearance startles him, too.  
  
  “How many?” I say.  
  
  “None. All of your people are safe this time.”  
  
  This time. I should be relieved. I am not. My people will be at risk again soon enough. “And the girl?”  
  
  “Gone. As always.”  
  
  I look back at the blood staining my hands, and a familiar tightness wraps around my rib cage. I turn back to the barrel and bury my hands in the water. It’s so cold it nearly steals my breath.  
  
  “I’m covered in blood, Commander.” A lick of anger curls through my chest. “I killed something.”  
  
  As if sensing danger, his horse stomps and dances at the end of the reins. Grey puts out a hand to calm the animal.  
  
  Once there would have been a stablehand rushing to take his horse, especially upon hearing my tone. Once there was a castle full of courtiers and historians and advisers who would have turned over a coin for a bit of gossip about Prince Rhen, heir to the throne of Emberfall.  
  
  Once there was a royal family that would have frowned on my antics.  
  
  Now there is me, and there is Grey.  
  
  “I left a trail of human blood on the path out of the forest,” he says, unaffected by my anger. He’s used to this. “The horse led a good chase, until you fell on a herd of deer in the southernmost part of your lands. We stayed well away from the villages.”  
  
  That explains the condition of the animal. We traveled far tonight.  
  
  “I’ll take the horse,” I say. “The sun will be up soon.”  
  
  Grey hands over the reins. This final hour is always the hardest. Full of regret for my failure once again. As always, I just want to get this over with.  
  
  “Any special requests, my lord?”  
  
  In the beginning, I was frivolous enough to say yes. I’d specify blondes or brunettes. Big breasts, or long legs, or tiny waists. I’d wine them and woo them and when they did not love me, another was easily found. The first time, the curse had seemed like a game.  
  
  Find me one you like, Grey, I’d said, laughing, as if finding women for his prince was a privilege.  
  
  Then I changed, and the monster tore through the castle, leaving a bloodbath.  
  
  When the season began again, I had no family left. No servants. Only six guardsmen, two of whom were badly injured.  
  
  By the third season, I had one.  
  
  Grey is still waiting for a response. I meet his eyes. “No, Commander. Anyone is fine.” I sigh and begin leading the horse toward the stables, but then stop and turn. “Whose blood made the trail?”  
  
  Grey raises an arm and draws his sleeve back. A long knife wound still bleeds down into his hand, a slow trickle of crimson.  
  
  I’d order him to bind it, but the wound will be gone in an hour, when the sun is fully up.  
  
  So will the blood on my hands and the sweat on the horse’s flanks. The cobblestones will be warm with early-fall sunlight, and my breath will no longer fog in the morning air.  
  
  The girl will be gone, and the season will begin again.  
  
  I’ll be newly eighteen.  
  
  For the three hundred twenty-seventh time.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  HARPER  
  
  Washington, DC, is so cold it should be illegal.  
  
  I pull up the hood of my sweatshirt, but the material is practically threadbare, and it doesn’t do much good. I hate being out here playing lookout, but my brother has the worse end of this job, so I try not to complain.  
  
  Somewhere down the street, a man shouts and a car horn blares. I bite back a shiver and suck more tightly into the shadows. I found an old tire iron near the curb earlier,  
and I twist my fingers against the rusted metal, but whoever it was seems far away.  
  
  A glance at the timer on Jake’s phone tells me he has another thirteen minutes. Thirteen minutes, and he’ll be done, and we can go buy a cup of coffee.  
  
  We don’t really have money to spend, but Jake always needs time to unwind, and he says coffee helps. It ratchets me up so I can’t sleep, which means I don’t crash until four in the morning and then I miss school. I’ve missed enough days of my senior year that it probably doesn’t matter anymore. I sure don’t have any friends who’ll miss me.  
  
  So Jake and I will sit in a corner booth of the all-night diner, and his hands will tremble on the mug for a few minutes. Then he’ll tell me what he had to do. It’s never good.  
  
  I had to threaten to break his arm. I twisted it up behind his back. I think I almost dislocated it. His kids were there. It was awful.  
  
  I had to punch him. Told him I was going to hit him until a tooth came loose. He found the money real quick.  
  
  This guy was a musician. I threatened to smash a finger.  
  
  I don’t want to hear the ways he shakes them down for cash. My brother is tall and built like a linebacker, but he’s always been gentle and soft-spoken and kind. When Mom first got sick, when Dad got involved with Lawrence and his men, Jake would look out for me. He’d let me sleep in his room or sneak me out of the house for ice cream. That was when Dad was around, when Dad was the one getting threatened by Lawrence’s “bill collectors,” the men who’d come to our door to reclaim the money Dad had borrowed.  
  
  Now Dad’s gone. And Jake’s playing “bill collector” just to keep them off our backs.  
  
  Guilt twists my insides. If it were just me, I wouldn’t let him do it.  
  
  But it’s not just me. It’s Mom, too.  
  
  Jake thinks he could do more for Lawrence. Buy us more time. But that would mean actually doing the things he’s only threatening to do. It would mean truly hurting people.  
  
  It would break him. I can already see how even this is changing him. Sometimes I wish he’d drink his coffee in silence.  
  
  I told him that once, and he got mad. “You think it’s hard to listen? I have to do it.” His voice was tight and hard and almost broke. “You’re lucky, Harper. You’re lucky you just have to hear about it.”  
  
  Yeah. I feel super lucky.  
  
  But then I felt selfish, because he’s right. I’m not quick, and I’m not strong. Playing lookout is the only way he’ll let me help. So now, when he needs to talk about these near-atrocities, I keep my mouth shut. I can’t fight, but I can listen.  
  
  I glance at the phone. Twelve minutes. If his time runs out, it means the job went bad, and I’m supposed to run. To get Mom out. To hide.  
  
  We’ve gotten down to three minutes before. Two minutes. But he always appears, breathing hard and sometimes speckled with blood.  
  
  I’m not worried yet.  
  
  Rust flakes under my fingertips as I twist the ice-cold tire iron in my hand. Sunrise isn’t far off, but I’ll probably be too frozen by then to even notice.  
  
  A light feminine laugh carries in the air nearby, and I peek from the doorway. Two people stand alone by the corner, just at the edge of the circle of light cast by the streetlamp. The girl’s hair shines like a shampoo commercial, swinging as she staggers a little. The bars all closed at three a.m., but she clearly didn’t stop. Her micro-mini and open denim jacket make my sweatshirt feel like a parka.  
  
  The man is more suitably dressed, in dark clothes, with a long coat. I’m trying to decide if this is a cop busting a hooker or a john picking up a date, when the guy turns his head. I duck back into the doorway.  
  
  Her laughter rings through the street again. Either he’s hilarious or this girl is hammered.  
  
  The laugh cuts short with a gasp. Like someone yanked a plug.  
  
  I hold my breath. The silence is sudden and absolute.  
  
  I can’t risk looking.  
  
  I can’t risk not looking.  
  
  Jake would be so pissed. I have one job here. I imagine him yelling. Don’t get involved, Harper! You’re already vulnerable!  
  
  He’s right, but cerebral palsy doesn’t mean my curiosity is broken. I peek out around the edge of the doorway.  
  
  The blonde has collapsed in the man’s arms like a marionette, her head flopped to the side. His arm is hooked under her knees, and he keeps glancing up and down the street.  
  
  Jake will lose his mind if I call the cops. It’s not like what he’s doing is legal. If the police come around, Jake is at risk. I’m at risk. Mom’s at risk.  
  
  I keep staring at that waving blond hair, at the limp arm dragging the ground. He could be a trafficker. She could be dead—or close. I can’t do nothing.  
  
  I slip out of my sneakers so my stupid left foot won’t make a dragging noise against the pavement. I can move quickly when I want to, but quiet is tough to master. I rush forward and raise the bar.  
  
  He turns at the last second, which probably saves his life. The bar comes down across his shoulders instead of his head. He grunts and stumbles forward. The girl goes sprawling onto the pavement.  
  
  I raise the bar to hit him again, but the man retaliates faster than I’m ready for. He blocks my swing and drives an elbow into my chest, hooking my ankle with his own. I’m falling before I realize it. My body slams into the concrete.  
  
  He’s suddenly right there, almost on top of me. I start swinging. I can’t reach his head, but I catch him across the hip. Then his ribs.  
  
  He seizes my wrist, then smacks my arm down to the pavement. I squeal and twist away from him, but it feels like he’s kneeling on my right thigh. His free arm pins my chest. It hurts. A lot.  
  
  “Release the weapon.” He’s got an accent, but I can’t place it. And now that his face is on top of mine, I realize he’s young, not much older than Jake.  
  
  I clench my fingers even tighter around the bar. My breath makes huge panicked clouds between us. I beat at him with my free hand, but I might as well be striking a statue. He tightens his hold on my wrist, until I genuinely think the bones are rubbing together.  
  
  A whimper escapes my throat, but I grit my teeth and hold on.  
  
  “Release it,” he says again, his tone thickening with anger.  
  
  “Jake!” I scream, hoping enough time has passed that he might be heading back. The pavement stabs daggers of ice into my back. Every muscle hurts, but I keep fighting. “Jake! Someone help me!”  
  
  I try to claw at his eyes, but the man’s grip tightens in response. His gaze meets mine and there’s no hesitation there. My wrist is going to break.  
  
  A siren kicks up somewhere nearby, but it’ll be too late. I try to claw at his face again, but I catch his neck instead. Blood blossoms under my nails, and his eyes turn murderous. The sky lightens fractionally behind him, turning pink with streaks of orange.  
  
  His free hand lifts and I don’t know if he’s going to hit me or strangle me or break my neck. It doesn’t matter. This is it. My last sight will be a glorious sunrise.  
  
  I’m wrong. His hand never strikes.  
  
  Instead, the sky disappears altogether.  
  
  CHAPTER THREE  
  
  RHEN  
  
  Sunlight gilds the fixtures in my sitting room, throwing shadows along the hand-sewn tapestries and the velvet chairs my parents once occupied. Sometimes, if I sit here long enough, I can imagine their presence. I can hear my father’s brusque voice, full of admonishment and lectures. My mother’s quiet disapproval.  
  
  I can remember my own arrogance.  
  
  I want to walk out of the castle and fling myself off a cliff.  
  
  That doesn’t work. I’ve tried. More than once.  
  
  I always wake here, in this room, waiting in the sunlight. The fire always burns low, just as it is now, the flames crackling in a familiar pattern. The stone floor appears freshly swept, wine and goblets sitting ready on a side table. Grey’s weapons hang on the opposite chair, waiting for his return.  
  
  Everything is always the same.  
  
  Except for the dead. They never come back.  
  
&nb  
sp; The fire pops, a bit of kindling sliding to the base of the fireplace. Right on schedule. Grey will reappear soon.  
  
  I sigh. Practiced words wait on my tongue, though sometimes it takes the girls a while to awaken from the sleeping ether Grey gives them. They’re always frightened at first, but I’ve learned how to ease their fears, to charm and coax them into trusting me.  
  
  Only to destroy that trust when autumn slides into winter. When they see me change.  
  
  The air flickers, and I straighten. As much as I hate the curse, the never-ending repetition of my life here, the girls are the one spot of change. Despite myself, I’m curious to see what motionless beauty will hang in Grey’s arms today.  
  
  But when Grey appears, he’s pinning a girl to the floor.  
  
  She’s not a motionless beauty. She’s scrawny and shoeless and digging her nails into the side of his neck.  
  
  Grey swears and knocks her hand away. Blood appears in lines across his throat.  
  
  I rise from the chair, nearly losing a moment to the sheer novelty of it all. “Commander! Release her.”  
  
  He flings himself back and finds his feet. The girl scrambles away from him, clutching a rusted weapon of some sort. Her movement is labored and clumsy.  
  
  “What is this?” She gets a hand on the wall and staggers to her feet. “What did you do?”  
  
  Grey grabs his sword from the chair, pulling it free from the scabbard with a fierceness I haven’t seen in … in ages. “Have no worries, my lord. This may be the shortest season yet.”  
  
  The girl raises the rusted bar as if that will provide any kind of defense against a trained swordsman. Dark curls spill out of the hood of her clothing, and her face is tired, drawn, and dusty. I wonder if Grey injured her, the way she keeps her weight off her left leg.  
  
  “Try it.” She glances between him and me. “I know a good spot I haven’t hit with this yet.”  
  
  “I will.” Grey lifts his weapon and steps forward. “I know a good spot I haven’t hit with this yet.”  
  
  “Enough.” I’ve never seen Grey go after one of the girls, but when he shows no intention of stopping, I sharpen my tone. “That is an order, Commander.”  
 He stops, but his sword remains in his hand and he doesn’t take his eyes off the girl. “Do not think,” he tells her, his voice fierce, “that this means I will allow you to attack me again.”  
  
  “Don’t worry,” she snaps. “I’m sure I’ll get another chance.”  
  
  “She attacked you?” My eyebrows rise. “Grey. She is half your size.”  
  
  “She makes up for it in temperament. She most assuredly was not my first choice.”  
  
  “Where am I?” The girl’s eyes keep flicking from me to him to the sword in his hand—and then to the doorway behind us. Her knuckles are white where they grip the bar. “What did you do?”  
  
  I glance at Grey and lower my voice. “Put up your sword. You’re frightening her.”  
  
  The Royal Guard is trained to obey without hesitation and Grey is no exception. He slides his weapon into its sheath, but strings the sword belt around his waist.  
  
  I cannot remember the last time he was fully armed on the first day of the season. Probably not since there were men to command and threats to deflect.  
  
  But removing the weapon has drained some of the tension from the room. I put out a hand and keep my voice gentle, the way I speak to skittish horses in the stables. “You are safe here. May I have your weapon?”  
  
  Her eyes slide to Grey, to where his hand remains on the hilt of his sword. “No way.”  
  
  “You fear Grey? Easily solved.” I look at him. “Commander. You are ordered to not harm this girl.”  
  
  He takes a step back and folds his arms.  
  
  The girl watches this exchange and then she draws a long breath and takes a tentative step forward, the bar held in front of her.  
  
  At least she can be tamed as easily as the others. I extend my hand and give her an encouraging look.  
  
  She takes another step—but then her expression shifts, her eyes darken, and she swings.  
  
  Hard steel slams into my waist, just below my rib cage. Silver hell, it hurts. I double over and barely have time to react before she’s swinging for my head.  
  
  Luckily, my training is nearly as thorough as Grey’s. I duck and catch the bar before she makes contact.  
  
  Now I understand why Grey grabbed his sword.  
  
  Her eyes flare, burning with defiance. I jerk her forward, ready to wrestle the bar out of her grasp.  
  
  Instead, she lets go, forcing me to fall back. She stumbles toward the door, limping into the hallway, her breathing ragged.  
  
  I let her go. The iron bar drops to the carpet and I press a hand to my side.  
  
  Grey hasn’t moved. He’s standing there, arms folded. “Do you still wish for me to leave her unharmed?”  
  
  There was a time when he wouldn’t have dared to question me.  
  
  There was a time when I might have cared.  
  
  I sigh, then wince as my lungs expand into the already-forming bruise on my side. What began as a novelty now simply hurts. If she fights to run so fiercely now, there is little hope for later.  
  
  The shadows have shifted a bit, tracing their familiar path. I’ve watched it hundreds of times.  
  
  When this season ends in failure, I’ll watch it again.  
  
  “She is injured,” says Grey. “She cannot get far.”  
  
  He is right. I am wasting time.  
  
  As if I don’t have time in spades.  
  
  “Go,” I say. “Bring her back.”  
  
  CHAPTER FOUR  
  
  HARPER  
  
  I’m running down a long hallway, my breath roaring in my ears. This has to be a museum or some kind of historical building. My socks fight to grip the velvet carpeting that lines the marble floor. Wood paneling covers the walls, with stone masonry climbing to a ceiling that arches high above. Heavy wooden doors with wrought-iron handles sit at uneven intervals along the hallway, but none are open.  
  
  I don’t stop to try any. I just run. I need to find another person or get out of here.  
  
  As I round a curve in the hallway, I’m met by a massive, sweeping, sunlit staircase that descends into a grand entranceway. The space is the size of my high school gymnasium, with a dark slate floor, massive stained glass windows, and a pair of iron doors. Tapestries hang from the walls, threaded with purples and greens and reds, shot through with strands of gold and silver that sparkle in the light. Tables sit along the side, laid out with cakes and pastries and dozens of champagne glasses. Half a dozen gilded white chairs wait in the corner, musical instruments sitting ready.  
  
  The place looks prepped for a wedding. Or a party. But definitely not a kidnapping.  
  
  I’m so confused—but at least I’ve found a door.  
  
  A sudden beeping pierces the silence.  
  
  Jake’s timer.  
  
  I dig the phone out of my pocket, staring at the flashing zeroes. My throat closes up. I don’t know if he made it out.  
  
  I need to get myself together. I’m standing in the open and tears won’t give me anything but a wet face. Once I find somewhere safe, I can call 911.  
  
  I grip the banister and rush down the steps. My left leg is clumsy and about to give way, but I mentally threaten to cut it off if it doesn’t get me out of here. It listens.  
  
  As I pass the corner, the instruments lift from the chairs in unison.  
  
  I startle and duck right, ready for one to come flying at me—but then, without warning, the instruments begin to play. Symphonic music fills the hall, a rich song filled with flutes and trumpets and violins.  
  
  This has to be a trick. An optical illusion. Like at a theme park, somehow triggered by my motion.  
  
  I reach out and grab a flute, expecting it to be fixed in place with thin wires or subtle plastic.  
  
  But it’s not. My hand closes on the metal like I’m picking it up from a shelf. The steel is vibrating as if someone is playing. There’s no weight to it—no batteries. No speaker. Nothing.  
  
  When I move it close to my ear, the sound is coming from inside the tube.  
  
  I take a step back and fling it away from me.  
  
  The flute snaps right back into place, levitating above the chair as though an invisible musician stood there holding it. The keys depress and release.  
  
  I swallow hard. This is a dream. I’m drugged. Something.  
  
  I’m wasting time. I need to get out of here.  
  
  I hurry for the door, prepared for it to be locked—but it’s not. I stumble out onto a marble platform, and warm air swirls around me. Stone walls stretch to either side, and steps lead down to a cobblestone path. Acres of trimmed grass stretch as far as I can see, dappled by randomly spaced trees. Flower beds. A massive fountain spraying water into the air. In the distance is a dense forest, thick with vibrant greenery.  
  
  No paved road that I can see.  
  
  The door swings closed behind me, clanking into place, choking the music into silence. There’s no railing here, so I ease down the steps and onto the cobblestones. The building towers over me, large cream-colored bricks spaced by blocks of marble and stone.  
  
  This isn’t a museum. It’s a castle. A big one.  
  
  And still, no people. No one anywhere—and I can see for acres. The silence is all-consuming. No cars. No buzzing power lines. No airplanes.  
  
  I jerk the phone out of my pocket and start punching in the numbers 911.  
  
  The phone beeps at me in protest. No service.  
  
  I shake it, like that’s somehow going to help. Everything across the top is grayed out.  
  
  No cell towers. No Wi-Fi. No Bluetooth.  
  
  A whimper escapes my chest.  
  
  Those instruments were playing themselves.  
  
  I can’t reason that out. It’s too tangled up with my very real worry for my brother.  
  
  A new thought hits me, piling more worry on top. If something happened to Jake, no one is there to help Mom. I imagine her lying in bed, coughing wetly from the cancer that crowds her lungs. Needing food. Medicine. Needing someone to bring her to the bathroom.  
  
  Without warning, my eyes blur. I swipe at my cheeks and force my legs to run. Sweat collects inside my sweatshirt.  
  
  Wait. Sweat. It’s warm.  
  
  It was free  
zing in DC.  
  
  All that sweat goes cold.  
  
  Panic later. I need to move.  
  
  A large outbuilding sits directly behind the castle, just beyond a sprawling courtyard lined with more cobblestones. Flowers bloom everywhere, spilling down wooden trellises, bursting from massive planters, blooming along hedges and in gardens. Still no people.  
  
  My muscles are tight and fatigued, and sweat runs a line down the side of my face. I pray for this to be some kind of garage, because I’m going to need an alternate form of transportation soon. I can’t keep running forever. I flatten against the far wall of the castle, breathing hard, waiting. Listening.  
  
  When I hear nothing, I head for the building across the courtyard, my left foot dragging and begging for a break. I stumble through the doorway, slipping a little in my damp socks.  
  
  Three horses throw up their heads and snort.  
  
  Oh wow. Not a garage. A stable.  
  
  This is almost better. I don’t know how to hot-wire a car, but I do know how to ride.  
  
  Back before our lives fell apart, when Dad had a job and a reputation, I rode horses. It had started as a therapeutic activity after all the cerebral palsy–related surgeries—but it turned into a passion. A freedom, as equine legs lent me strength and power. I worked at the stables in exchange for riding time for years, until we needed to move to the city.  
  
  Of everything we’ve had to give up, I miss the horses the most.  
  
  Thirty stalls flank each side of the aisle, made of richly stained boards leading halfway to the ceiling, topped with iron bars. Well-kept horses gleam in the sunlight that creeps through the skylights. Bridles hang at regular intervals along the wall, their bits and buckles sparkling, the leather carrying a rich shine. No wisps of hay lie in the aisle, no swarming flies collect on spilled grain. Every inch of these stables is perfection.  
  
  A buckskin stretches out his nose to blow puffs at my hand. He’s tied to a ring inside his stall, and he’s already saddled. He didn’t jump when I came sliding into the aisle, and even now regards me calmly. He’s big and solid, with a tan-colored coat and a black mane and tail. A hammered gold sign on the front of his stall reads Ironwill.  
  
  I run a hand down the buckskin’s face. “I’ll just call you Will.”  
  
  A small closet beside his stall door houses boots and cloaks—and a dagger strung along a belt.  
  
  A real weapon. Yes.  
  
  I loop it around my waist and cinch it tight. The boots are too big, but they lace up my calves almost to my knees, giving my ankles some extra support.  
  
  I ease into the stall and bolt the door closed behind me. Will accepts a bridle readily, despite my shaking hands jerking at his mouth when I have to tighten the buckles.  
  
  “Sorry,” I whisper, stroking him on the cheek. “Out of practice.”  
  
  Then I hear the footstep, the rough rasp of a boot on stone.  
  
  I freeze—then duck to the far side of the horse, dragging him into a shadowed corner of the stall. His reins have gone slick in my palm, but I keep a tight hold so he blocks me here.  
  
  Someone clucks to each horse, making his way through the stables. A soft word, a pat on the neck. Another pause, then more footsteps.  
  
  Whoever it is, he’s checking the stalls.  
  
  A wooden shelf runs along the side of the stall, probably for hay or feed. I fold my body onto it, then shimmy up and get to my hands and knees. It’s an awkward position for mounting, but there’s no way I can do it from the ground. I have to concentrate to maneuver my foot into the stirrup. Sweat courses down my back now, but I grab hold of the saddle.  
  
  It takes everything I have not to whimper. This is the world’s most patient animal, because he stands absolutely still as I haul myself onto his back.  
  
  But I’m up here. I’m on.  
  
  I’m so exhausted I’m ready to cry. No, I am crying. Silent tears roll down my cheeks. I have to get out of here. I have to.  
  
  Footsteps, then a soft gasp of surprise. The bolt is thrown. I catch a glimpse of dark hair and see a flash of steel as the man draws a sword. The stall door begins to swing open.  
  
  I slam my heels into Will’s flanks, screaming in rage for good measure. The horse is terrified—with reason. I’m terrifying myself. But he springs forward, slamming the door wide, knocking the armed man out of the way.  
  
  “Go!” I cry. “Please, Will! Go!” I dig my heels into his sides.  
  
  Will leaps across the aisle, finds purchase, and bolts.  
  
  Tears blur my vision, but sight won’t help me stay on. I’ve lost both stirrups already, and we’re careening over cobblestones. The fingers of my left hand tangle in Will’s mane, and my other hand has wrapped around his neck. When we hit the grass, the horse is like a pumping oil rig, slamming me up and down with each stride.  
  
  A sharp whistle cuts the air behind me, three short chirps of sound.  
  
  Will digs in his hooves, skids to a stop, and whirls. I don’t have a chance. I go flying over his shoulder and crash into the turf.  
  
  For a moment, I don’t know which way is up. My head spins.  
  
  So close. So close.  
  
  Those men are coming after me. They’re a blur in the sunlight, whether from tears or a head injury. I need to get to my feet. I need to run.  
  
  I manage to get myself upright, but my legs don’t want to work quickly. The blond man is already there, reaching to grab me. The dark-haired swordsman is just behind him.  
  
  “No!” A small sound squeaks free of my chest. I stagger away from him and draw the dagger.  
  
  The swordsman begins to pull his weapon.  
  
  I backpedal farther, trip over my own feet, and sit down hard in the grass.  
  
  “Commander. Stop,” the blond man says. He puts his hands up. “Be at ease. I will not harm you.”  
  
  “You chased me.”  
  
  “It’s what we do to horse thieves,” the swordsman says.  
  
  “Grey.” The blond man cuts a sharp look his way, then extends a hand to me. “Please. You have nothing to fear.”  
  
  He must be kidding.  
  
  I didn’t get a good look at him before, but I do now. His profile is striking, with high cheekbones and an angular jaw. Rich brown eyes. No freckles, but enough time in the sun to stop anyone from describing him as pale. He wears a white shirt under a high-collared blue jacket accented with leather trim and detailed gold stitching. Gold buckles cross his chest and a dagger is belted to his hip.  
  
  He’s staring down at me as if he faces half-crazed girls all the time.  
  
  I keep my dagger brandished in front of me. “Tell me where I am.”  
  
  “You are on the grounds of Ironrose Castle, in the heart of Emberfall.”  
  
  I rack my brain, trying to think of any attractions with those names that could be reasonably close to DC. This castle is huge. I would have heard of it. And Jake’s ticking timer is the one puzzle piece that refuses to fit. There is literally nowhere the swordsman could have taken me so quickly. I wet my lips. “What’s the closest city?”  
  
  “Silvermoon Harbor.” He hesitates, then steps closer. “You’re confused. Please—allow me to help you.”  
  
  “No.” I thrust the dagger up at him and he stops. “I’m getting out of here. I’m going home.”  
  
  “You cannot find your way home from here.”  
  
  I glare at the armed man behind him. “He got me here. There has to be a way back.”  
  
  The swordsman’s expression is inscrutable, lacking any of the charm of the man in front of me. “There is not.”  
  
  I glare up at him. “There has to be.”  
  
  His face does not change. “There. Is. Not.”  
  
  “Enough.” The blond man extends a hand again. “We will not argue this point in the courtyard. Come. I will show you to a room. Are you hungry?”  
  
  I can’t decide if they’re crazy—or if I am. I adjust my grip on the dagger. “I’m not going anywhere with you.”  
  
  “I understand your reluctance, but I cannot allow you to leave the castle grounds. It is unsafe. I have no soldiers to patrol the King’s Highway.”  
  
&n  
bsp; “The King’s Highway,” I repeat numbly. Everything he says sounds so logical. Not like he’s trying to cajole me into following him. More like he’s surprised I would consider anything else.  
  
  I can’t make sense of any of this.  
  
  “Please,” he says more gently. “Surely you know we could take you by force.”  
  
  My heart skips a beat in my chest. I do know that. I don’t know what’s worse—being taken by force, or going willingly. “Don’t you threaten me.”  
  
  “Threaten you?” His eyebrows go up. “You think I intend to threaten you by offering safety and comfort and food?”  
  
  He sounds offended. I know men who take what they want. They don’t act like this.  
  
  I don’t know where I am, but my body already hurts. I’m not entirely sure I can get off the ground unaided. I definitely can’t run again.  
  
  He’s right: they could take me by force. I should conserve my energy.  
  
  I can rest. I can eat. I’ll find a way out.  
  
  I hold my breath and slide the dagger into its sheath. I expect the men to protest my keeping the weapon, but they don’t.  
  
  Despite my determination, this feels like giving up. I wonder what Jake would say.  
  
  Oh, Jake. I don’t know if he’s okay. I don’t know what to do.  
  
  I can survive this. I have to.  
  
  So I grit my teeth, lock down my emotions, and reach up to take his hand.  
  
  CHAPTER FIVE  
  
  RHEN  
  
  After we return Ironwill to the stables, the girl walks quietly beside me, her gait uneven enough to tell me she’s truly injured. She’s keeping her distance from both me and Grey, her arms wrapped tightly around her abdomen, one hand resting on the hilt of her dagger.  
  
  I’m impressed that she found a weapon—and more so that she went for the stables as a means of escape. Most of the girls Grey drags from her world won’t touch a blade or a bridle, and instead gravitate to the finery found within the lushly outfitted wardrobes inside Ironrose Castle. This early in the season, the other girls would sit by the hearth and gaze at me over crystal goblets, while I’d pour wine and tell stories with just enough devilishness to make them blush.",1,1753283543.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1m7bw8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1m7bw8l/swallowed_by_darkness_mission/,Swallowed by Darkness (Mission),"It was meant to be a normal day.

 

But of course, there’s never a normal day in the life of Beyonders.

 

Poetic smiled brightly as he introduced the two Beyonders to each other for the first time.

 

“Mist, this is Haru. She’s a close friend of mine, as well as a contractee, and she helped me a lot during the Black Emperor cultist case.” He introduced. “And Haru, this is Mist. She worked with me a little before, and she was also helped taking out a bunch of the Black Emperor cultists.”

 

Mist smiled softly, while Haru nodded curtly. They both turned to Poetic, who was the one who had gathered them in the first place.

 

“So? Something’s happening around here?” Mist asked, tilting her head. But before she could continue, Poetic held up his hand.

 

“Let’s not talk about it for now. It’s not urgent, unlike the Black Emperor cult. Let’s go get a cup of coffee first! I hear Café Del Fin has opened up a branch store over here!”

 

“Oh, how nice. I was missing kat’s coffee. I hope they taste somewhat the same.” Mist chirped. Meanwhile, Haru looked a little disgruntled at the mention of the Café Del Fin but didn’t say anything.

 

However, as they walked, simultaneously their spiritual intuitions flared up. Without a second of delay nor a moment of hesitation, the three leapt into action, summoning spirits, producing flames, and activating their sealed artefacts.

 

But there was nothing to fight, as the ground below them erupted with degenerated shadows, as a thousand arms of darkness reached up to grab the three of them. Their entire bodies shook as the shadows, colder than the Abyss itself, was chilling them to the bone.

 

It was a silent and ravenous, an all consuming mass that latched onto the three of them.

 

“Mist! Haru!” Poetic cried out. But it was too late.

 

The other two had already been swallowed. 

 

And soon, he felt his head fall under.

 

\*\*\*

 

They awoke to darkness.

 

There was a primordial emptiness that surrounded them. Even the Spirit Warlock Mist was almost unable to see through the darkness. They were trapped in an inescapable darkness, filled with cold and silence, that it wouldn’t be abnormal to think that they had died.

 

Groggily, the three of them got up. Their movements felt slow, and their minds seemed to be lulled to sleep. And the hands made of shadow were completely gone, as if their only objective was to drag them into this lightless world.

 

“Where are we?” Muttered Poetic, rubbing his temples with his knuckles.

 

“I can’t tell.” Mist grimaced.

 

“I could light a fireball, but that might be a bad idea.” Haru grumbled. “If we’re stuck somewhere with limited amounts of oxygen, then we’ll be accelerating our deaths.”

 

“Wait, I have a sun charm.” Mist remembered, rummaging through her pockets before pulling out a golden charm. Quietly muttering a word in Giant, holy light radiated outwards.

 

But it shone weakly, flickering like a dying candle. The light that should’ve stretched for tens of metres could barely illuminate the three of them. The soothing warmth of the sun couldn’t chase away the freezing cold. It was as if the light was being devoured by the noxious night.

 

And in the weak glow, the three of them saw monstrosities.

 

Chimeric abominations, monstrous combinations, and incomprehensible beings doomed to condemnation, all surrounded them. They were unlike anything they had ever seen before, horrifying beyond belief.

 

“Where did they come from!? How did our spiritual intuition not detect them?” Poetic exclaimed.

 

And then there was the darkness.

 

It was not just the absence of illumination.

 

It was an eternal lightlessness.

 

The world without definition, without meaning.

 

It was the insatiable voracity of the evernight.

 

“Slow!” Haru screamed out, activating a partial demonisation in the process. As she rocketed forward with leathery bat wings, Poetic snapped his fingers, flipping his lucky coin. Mist let out a high pitched note, like a lullaby, her Requiem soothing the monster’s emotions.

 

But the darkness was surging forth, like a tidal wave, a force of nature.

 

Hauling the two of them into her arms, Haru bolted into the darkness, the wind whistling past as they flew through the unknown. Hanging on, Mist and Poetic were repelling the monsters away from their path. Monsters collapsed to the floor in exhaustion, had boulders dropping from calamities, and choked from poisons.

 

But the darkness couldn’t be contained, it couldn’t be stopped. Its endlessly swelling body was reaching out to devour them whole.

 

~~Pulling out another sun charm, Mist imbued her spirituality into it. Raising her hand, she chucked it into the swirling abyss. She opened her mouth, ready to chant the activation word. The charm was swallowed by the darkness.~~

 

Mist blinked in confusion, her mind blank. There was something on the edge of her mind, but she couldn’t tell what it was. No matter how much she searched with her spiritual intuition, nothing came up. Turning to Poetic, he also looked dazed, as if he was suddenly waking up.

 

“There’s… something messing with our senses.” She muttered, sounding unsure. But the two were shaken out of their bewilderment as Haru swerved sharply, barely moving out of the way of a spindly skeletal arm, reaching over 10 metres long.

 

“Slow! A little help would be nice!” Haru gritted her teeth, unable to fend off everything while simultaneously trying to escape. Seeing the sun charm dying, after only a few minutes even when it is supposed to last hours, Mist activated another one.

 

They flew through these curse lands, labyrinthian tunnels and turns causing them to lose all sense of place and direction. They could only tell that the darkness was behind them, and it was rapacious.

 

“I… don’t think I can last much longer!” Haru screamed, weakness soaking into her bones. Even with just a partial transformation, she could feel the suffocating embrace of the Abyss clawing at her, calling her like a siren. She was drenched with sweat, cascading down her face.

 

Pulling off the Windblessed bracelet from her wrist, Poetic activated it, feeling the strain on his lungs. As her wings folded into herself and she fell limp, Poetic took the mantle, flying them through this hellish landscape. But they were lagging more than before, and the darkness was closing in on them.

 

“I can teleport short distances if we snuff out the light!” Mist suggested, tugging out a tiny crimson moon, shining even dimmer than the sun charm.

 

“Can we afford this little light?” Haru hissed. “The darkness is probably stronger in the dark!”

 

“Astute observation!” Mist snapped back. “We can’t afford flying straight like this! Either we die soon, or we try it out!”

 

Throwing the final sun charm behind, the tiny crimson moon began to hover around their heads, shining down on the three of them. Then, they turned incorporeal, blinking out of existence for a single second, before appearing in a few dozen metres in front.

 

Alternating the Windblessed Bracelet to offset its negative effect, the trio barely escaped the darkness’ maws. But their spirituality wasn’t infinite, they would soon run out.

 

And right as they were about to be swallowed, a shining light appeared.

 

Not metaphorically, but literally.

 

A young girl, her face marred with horrendous scars, stood, holding a tiny amulet shining with light. She couldn’t’ve been any older than 10, and it was clear something was wrong. Her bones popped out like they hadn’t been fed in months, while the left sleeve on her shirt held no arm. It was jarring seeing such a tiny figure in the midst of these monstrosities.

 

“A trap?” Haru asked.

 

Poetic and Mist glanced at each other, nodding their heads.

 

“No point not trying. HELP!” Poetic screamed, causing the young girl to flinch. She took a few steps back, quivering.

 

“Please!” Mist cried out. “Is there anywhere safe?”

 

The young girl with blonde hair stared at the three of them, contemplating for a few seconds. Then, she nodded her head, waving her hand and signalling them to follow.  

 

They followed her, descending lower and lower into the jaws of the cavern.

 

Then they saw it.

 

A blinding light.

 

A village surrounded by a barrier of light.

 

Runic symbols of protection, warding, and purification floated on its surface.

 

The young girl, who had been sprinting as fast as she could, tilted her head up and shouted.

 

“MISS ELLORA!”

 

And then the three of them felt it. Mist couldn’t help but freeze up as an overbearing force weighed down upon her.

 

“Don’t shout so loudly, Minnie.” A voice sang.

 

And out from nowhere, a woman with fur clothing stepped out.

 

No, it wasn’t fur clothing.

 

She was half demonic wolf.

 

The woman, Ellora, raised her hand.

 

 

And the darkness, for the first time since the trio had been sent here, halted.

 

Strings of darkness held back the surging chaos.

 

For just a split second.

 

But it was enough.

 

The three of them crash landed into the dirt, skidding along the rock until they rolled into the barrier of light.

 

The darkness behind them crashed into the barrier, like a tsunami.

 

The barrier flickered, but it didn’t break.

 

Ellora stared down at the three of them, who were untangling themselves. They slowly stood up, groaning.

 

“Hello, lost ones.” She spoke, her voice staid, and calming. It was like a lullaby, sung gently by a caring mother. “My name is Ellora. Leader of this Village cloaked in darkness. You must be tired. Let’s get you inside.”

\*\*\*

Ellora leads the trio through the village and into a small clearing. The land is dry, with the exception of a circle of stones placed on the ground. Inside of it, half burnt firewood is propped up in the middle. She gestures for them to take seats around the circle, lighting a small fire with the torch in her hand.

 

Poetic and Haru sit across each other, while Mist sits across Ellora. A gentle crackling comes from the flame, warding off the chill of the darkness with a warm ambience.

 

Ellora holds a brochette of root vegetables over the flame. “I’m sure you have questions.” She says gently. “Ask away.”

 

Poetic is the first to speak. “Do you know what brought us here?”

 

“No.” Ellora shakes her head. “All attempts at divination have failed, and I am rather unsure of what it could even be.”

 

“Then,” It is Mist this time. “Could you elaborate a bit on the village’s situation, Ma’am?”

 

“Just Ellora is fine.” The wolf-eared lady says, a hint of grumpiness in her tone.

 

“Ellora.” Haru asks, after a moment. “How come the Sun stays set for so long here?”

 

Ellora takes a moment to collect herself and answers. “A long time ago, we knew the Sun and basked in its light, worshipping it as our illuminator and guide.

 

 Alas, it started to dim and disappear over time; And the Night’s influence grew. Our ancestors created a ritual – The Protection of Light, to channel the Sun’s remnant powers for the health of our people, and to keep the darkness at bay.”

 

We nurtured our beyonders of the Sun to maintain it, to keep our legacy alive.” Ellora’s expression grows resigned, and her tone is weary as she speaks.

 

“Several weeks ago, a Dragon appeared around the village. At first it simply wandered, but it soon began to wreak havoc in the areas around the village – Corrupting anything that it came into contact with.

 

 At first, our ritual kept us from harm, but we could tell that maintaining it was taking a far heavier toll on Sol and Phoebe than usual. This led us to make the decision to cleanse it from the core. We sent our strongest to cull the threat, but they,” her voice cracks. “They were all wiped out.”

 

She pauses.

 

“No, not me… I lived. I lived.”

A soothing calm washes over the four, and Mist’s eyes glimmer in recognition.

 

“Can you tell us about the Dragon?” she asks gently. “Anything that you haven’t already mentioned.”

 

“It is at least on a Demigod’s level, and from the Secrets Supplicant line. I also recognized abilities of the Mind Pathway. That is all I can tell you.” Ellora says with a sigh.

 

“And this ritual, is it still in effect?” Poetic asks.

 

He is met with a nod.

 

“For now.”

 

“You don’t have anyone left to maintain it.” Haru says, realizing the implications of such a thing. “Does that mean it’s going to weaken or outright fade now?”

 

“Yes.” Ellora’s tone is resigned. “I have been burning my own spirituality to fuel it, but it is beginning to weaken, and so am I. Even if we were to harness the power of every beyonder around here, it would last for a week at most.”

 

A sombre tone is left in the air. Ellora removes the skewer from the flame, replacing it for another and handing it to Haru who is sitting next to her. Haru looks at her questioningly, then takes a bite, nodding in approval at the taste. For the next while, the four eat in a comfortable silence.

 

“We should be heading back now.” Ellora’s cold demeanour returns. None of the trio comment on it, and agree with her suggestion to call it a night.

 

—x—x—x—x—x—x—x—x—

 

Mist sighs as she opens a window, letting the cool air blow into the room.

She takes a moment to massage her temple, and checks with her spirit vision to try and detect any abnormalities.

 

*Nothing.*

 

“Well,” she mumbles under her breath. “The potion’s called Sleepless for a reason.”

 

She takes a deep breath, propping herself up and jumping out the open window.

 

She finds herself wandering the village, looking around in the dark. Her eyes are far more used to the shadows, and for a moment she wonders why the tribe feel the need to worship the sun when they have *this.*

 

“Having trouble sleeping?” A voice comes from behind her.

 

Ellora stands still, unperturbed by Mist suddenly whirling around, ready to attack.

 

Mist calms down upon seeing who it is, and gives the woman an accusatory look.

“You didn’t have to do that.” If one were to look closely, her expression would very much resemble a pout. “And I’m a Sleepless, that’s kind of the whole point.”

 

“I could tell.”

 

“You weren’t exactly subtle with that tranquility spell either, you know.

 

 The two keep chatting as they walk.

 

“Ellora.” Mist’s voice is hesitant. “Do you know what Darkness is?”

 

“The absence of Light.” Ellora speaks calmly. “We refer to the darkened fog that surrounds us as the darkness.

 

“No, not darkness, Darkness…” Mist feels her blood rushing in embarrassment. “Uppercase D. Do you… know of the term?”

 

A sigh.

 

“Darkness is the highest sequence of our pathway.”

 

Mist pauses. “The sequence one potion is called Darkness?”

 

“Zero.”

 

*“What?!”*

Mist stares, wide-eyed. “There’s a… Sequence 0?”

“Ellora?”

 

Ellora turns her head, indicating she is done with the topic.

 

“Then, what sequence are you?” Mist asks instead.

 

“Sequence Four.” She answers. “A Nightwatcher.”

 

They do not converse after that. Ellora leads her through the village, with the pair walking in silence and Mist occasionally peering into an open window. She looks at a sleeping young boy with brown hair, his tan skin discoloured and his face partly covered in burns.

 

“Albus got those scars from his brother lighting their house on fire, a long time ago.” Ellora explains, her voice tinged with sorrow. “Mark didn’t do it intentionally… Such things can happen with born beyonders. 



“Albus never resented him for it. But his brother just couldn’t stop feeling guilty and like he was a danger to everyone around him… and just when he began to get better, Mark lost himself to the Dragon’s corruption.”

 

A sombre silence fills the air.

 

“That’s awful…” Mist finds herself saying. For at least she had gotten twelve years with Lana, twelve years which she cherished dearly.

 

“Nothing can be done about it now.” Ellora’s voice snaps her out of her reverie. “This is the fate of our tribe.” She turns to look at the brunette.

 

“You should go. Even the Sleepless need rest.”

 

“Yes.. you too.” 

 

The air is heavy. It remains that way for a long, long time.

 

\*\*\*

 

The village has a tradition. They have simple routines during the day, referring to the period between sleep and wake rather than the time of sunlight. They had something akin to the daytime. Periods of a light that descends upon them every so often. But the Sun is no where to be found still even in those patches of light. Ever since they had lost the sun, they had taken to cherish it in another way. 

 

By singing hymns of it.

 

O! When the Sun shall rise

 

O! When the Sun shall rise

 

We will sing our reprise

 

Our warmth and Our respite

 

O! When the Sun shall rise

 

I, a servant of the light,

 

Will give the dark a spark

 

Will shine like stars so bright

 

O! When the Sun shall rise

 

O! When the Sun shall rise

 

After the hymn is sung the children pile up around Haru and play with her. Climbing onto her and hanging off her wings

Ellora’s voice quivers on the last part. She has a reminiscent and solemn look. And if one were to peer hard enough, one would detect hints of regret. And it was obvious what the regret was. It was painfully obvious.

 

Poetic decides to give Ellora some reassurance. “We people aren’t exactly role models, yes, but… we can assure you we can still teach them.”

 

Ellora raises an eyebrow and looks at Poetic. “Show me I can trust you to raise Albus to be a gentleman and raise Mina and Aphrah to be ladies.”

 

Poetic shakes his head, “We can’t do that much. But I know some people who can.”

 

Ellora clicks her tongue and says impassively, “Empty promises….”

 

Mist snaps her finger, “How about you let us teach them something?”

 

Ellora is about to speak again as Haru crashes down with the kids laughing and saying “Again! Again!” Seeing this, Ellora nods. “Show me then.”

 

Poetic walks over to the children and releases some luck. He then raises his hand and says,”Albus! Mina! Aphrah!”

 

They all turn their attention from the exhausted Haru towards Poetic. Inwardly, Haru mutters a grateful comment. Her wings retreated as the children sat around Poetic now.

 

Poetic then begins, “Do you children not think that Haru may be tired from playing with you?”

 

Albus tilts his head, “Ms. Haru doesn’t like playing with us?”

 

Haru’s ears also perk. Mist and Ellora also focus on the lecture.

 

Mina and Aphrah also nod. 

 

Poetic smiles and with an extended hand asks Albus, “Do you think it is like that? That Haru doesn’t like playing with you? Or perhaps, is there something else to it?”

 

Aphrah immediately asks, “Sir, I think Ms. Haru likes playing with us.”

 

Mina also adds, “Yes. But I think… um… I think she doesn’t want to *right now*.”

 

Poetic applauds Mina, “Correct! See, Ms. Haru absolutely enjoys playing with you children, but you are inconveniencing her. So what should you do?”

 

Mina, Albus and Aphrah all think deeply for a moment. Even Haru falls deep in thought. Ethics wasn’t really her strong suit to begin with. 

 

Albus then finally say, “We should… apologize?”

 

Poetic nods, “Yes!! And Haru,”

 

Haru is snapped out of her deep thought as Poetic continues, “What will you do when they apologize?”

 

Haru again is lost in a deep contemplative thought. “Accept their apology right? I mean they’re just kids.”

 

Poetic smiles and looks at the kids expectantly. Mina immediately understands. She grabs Aphrah’s hand and runs towards Haru. Albus follows them as he starts reaching an answer too.

 

The three stand in a row in front of Haru and say in an innocent tone, “We’re sorry!”

 

Haru is taken aback and remembers the lesson she was just taught, “It’s alright. I don’t mind anyways.” The girls laugh as Albus then looks at Poetic.

 

Poetic then turns to Ellora. Mist walks over to the children. And joins them to take them away from Haru for a moment.

 

Poetic then turns to Ellora, “That’s a sample of what we can teach them.”

 

Ellora smiles as a hopeful glimmer starts to take place in her eyes, “That is more than enough.”

 

— – — – —

 

The ‘daytime’ had come again. 27. 27 dead from the corruption to bury. These aren’t all at once, heavens no. These are the bodies accumulated between this daytime and the last. The village has a tradition. They bury their dead in sunlight and purify their dead so they don’t become spirits. They firmly believe that burying them in the dark is disrespectful to the dead.

 

We help carry the dead. 

 

Quiet and eerie. The light is very bright, a sharp contrast to the dark and gloomy mood. It ought to rain now, but… the light had some solemnity to it. One which perhaps even the rain was unable to bring.

 

Ellora stands on the altar. Usually this is reserved for the High Priest, but…. He has since passed.

Ellora then reads out the names of the deceased in a slow and somber tone. Not needing a piece of paper. She begins recitation.

 

Alaria Barkwood, Halus Barkwood, Julius Kantt, Melina Kantt, Kasandra Kantt, Maxwell Arwin, Lister Arwin, Noman Arwin, Sheffield Arwin, Miranda Solstice, Lex Solstice, Kasandra Boquet, Albus Servus, Lark Night, Vice Night, Harold Herald, Jaundice Blisters, Ignis Flaria, Summer Solstice, Francis Reflux, Blur Past, Truman Past, Farman Past, Keith Night, Mann Hugh, and Fal Axer Blunt.

 

Ellora is seen wiping her tears. She chokes another cry. One by one the bodies are lowered. The villagers, who were all very close to each other, weep for their lost. They weep in the embrace of the warmth of light. 

 

It was a beautiful sunny day. 

 

We spent it staring into the dark dirt.

 

And then we walked away.

 

But some remained in that dark dirt. Poetic overhears Mina whisper something, “It’s a beautiful sunny day…. A shame they won’t be able to see it.”

 

While we sang the hymns of the warmth of the sun, there were those which lie in the cold, cold dirt. A prayer is resounded. Again, from Ellora, who at this point is a tired grieving mess. She stands tall. She has to. As she recites the prayer

 

O! I one of Sun, Child of Light

 

The respite of Spirits, the Death’s might

 

Guide these souls in dark depths

 

To your encompassing and compassionate

 

Warmth and security

 

Bless thee, your children

 

Your children…. Your… child–

 

Ellora begins to choke mid prayer as guilt washes over her. Mist seeing this casts a subtle requiem.

 

Ellora completes the prayer.

 

Your children, let them return 

 

To you. To light.



They all stare.

 

Albus, Mina, and Aphrah hold onto the three of them, tears welling out of their eyes.

 

No longer can they feel Ellora’s warmth.

 

No longer can they hold her tightly.

 

No longer will they hear her voice sing again.

 

“To your eternal peace, Ellora.” Mist mutters. Only the skull on the ground, and the name in their hearts, as proof of existence.

 

Haru looked down at Mina, who was holding tightly onto her.

 

“… Let’s go. We have a dragon to kill.”

 

Vengeance will be enacted.

 

For the residents, of Darkness Village.

1m7bvq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m7bvq8/can_you_do_a_volcano_tour_from_oahu/,Can you do a volcano tour from Oahu?,"Let me share my recent experience researching volcano tours from Oahu, as I know many visitors are curious about seeing active volcanoes while staying in Honolulu.

The short answer is yes - but there's a catch. The active volcanoes are actually on the Big Island of Hawaii, not on Oahu. However, you can easily take a day trip from Oahu to see them.

While staying in Waikiki, I discovered that if you really want to see volcanoes, you'll need to book an inter-island tour or flight to the Big Island. These typically run $400-600 per person and involve a full day of travel.

But here's what many people don't realize - Oahu itself is formed by two ancient volcanoes, and while they're not active, they've created some incredible landscapes you can explore. Instead of spending a fortune on inter-island travel, I found an excellent alternative that lets you experience Oahu's volcanic heritage and much more.

I recently took the Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island), and it was honestly the best decision. For about a third of the cost of a Big Island volcano tour, you get to see:

- The Diamond Head crater (an ancient volcanic cone)
- Halona Blowhole (created by ancient lava tubes)
- Hidden volcanic formations along the coastline
- Plus tons of non-volcanic but equally spectacular sites

The tour also includes stops at:
- North Shore's famous beaches
- Waimea Waterfall (where you can swim!)
- Local coffee and macadamia nut tastings
- Historic sites like Nu'uanu Pali Lookout

What I particularly appreciated was our guide's knowledge about Oahu's volcanic history. They explained how the island formed and pointed out fascinating geological features I would've missed on my own.

The 8-hour tour costs $154 per person, which is excellent value considering it includes transport, entrance fees, and a professional guide. They pick you up right from your Waikiki hotel, and the air-conditioned bus is comfortable for the full-day journey.

Pro tip: Bring your swimsuit for the waterfall and some cash for lunch - the North Shore garlic shrimp trucks are amazing!

If you're set on seeing active volcanoes, yes, you'll need to visit the Big Island. But if you want to experience Hawaii's volcanic landscape while getting a comprehensive tour of Oahu's best spots, I highly recommend this Circle Island tour. 

The best part is you can book now and pay later, plus there's free cancellation up to 24 hours before. Just make sure to book in advance as spots fill up quickly, especially during peak season.

For those interested, you can check availability and book the tour here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island

Remember, while you won't see active lava flows on Oahu, you'll still get to experience the incredible landscape shaped by ancient volcanic activity, plus all the other amazing sights the island has to offer.",1,1753283507.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

1m7bt8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1m7bt8w/e8_strangely_weak_coffee/,E8 Strangely Weak Coffee,"I’m hoping the experts here can offer some help or advice, as my ongoing problems are puzzling me. I recently inherited a Piano Black E8. My parents had used it before, and it was refurbished (bought by my grandfather) sometime before 2019. It always made them good coffee, but they upgraded to a Z10 and this one went unused for a bit. I moved and got this one, giving my J6 to a friend.

About a year ago, that workhorse of a J6 was making basically water, and the pucks were just sludge. I switched burrs, cleaned and lubricated the brew group, and calibrated it. It made great coffee in the year since. Of course, upon pulling this machine out and trying to use it, it is having similar, but different issues. 

The coffee is weak, even on finest grind and highest strength. I am using beans I know well and usually work great. I already did a full cleaning and descale cycle. I’ve pulled out the grinder and checked that the discharge chute is clear, and it just has normal coffee grounds one would expect. The coffee has thick, but pale crema, making me think the brew pressure and beans are fine (though I haven’t checked yet with pre ground as I never buy it). It seems to just be a dosing issue. The semi-intact picks are about 1/2 the thickness I would expect, less than 1cm. I’m not sure how people weigh them (do I have to capture a single one and dry it out?) but I can do that. 

I should probably do the same cleaning I did with my last one, as there is some grime, but it’s not 1/2 as bad as machines I’ve seen on here. But what else is there to do? I could replace burrs, but that is a pricier attempt that may not work. What do people recommend I troubleshoot?

On that note: can anyone answer what model grinder I have, for finding burrs. I figured it out with my last one but since there have been multiple E8 generations, I can’t find a definitive answer.

Thanks!

By Emma Marris, The Atlantic. [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/ai-slop-internet-addiction/683619/](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/07/ai-slop-internet-addiction/683619/)

Finding love is hard. For a while, dating apps seemed to make it easier, putting a city’s worth of single people in the palm of your hand. But AI has cast a paranoid pall over what can already be a suboptimal experience. If you get a message that feels a little off, it is hard to know whether you are flirting with a bot—or just someone insecure enough to use ChatGPT as their own Cyrano de Bergerac. In frustration, my friend Lonni has started picking up women at the nail salon like it’s 1997.

Or, in the midst of an emotionally fraught conversation with a friend or family member, a text might read strangely. Is the person on the other end using AI to compose their messages about the fairness of Aunt Beryl’s will or the future of your relationship? The only way to find out is to call them or, better yet, meet them for a coffee.

Or maybe you want to learn something. Many of the internet’s best resources for getting everyday answers are quickly being inundated with the dubious wisdom of AI. YouTube, long a destination for real people who know how to repair toilets, make omelets, or deliver engaging cultural criticism, is getting less human by the day: The newsletter Garbage Day [reports](https://sherwood.news/tech/ai-created-videos-are-quietly-taking-over-youtube/) that four of May’s top 10 YouTube channels were devoted to AI-generated content. Recently, the fastest-growing channel featured AI babies in dangerous situations, for some reason. Reddit is currently overrun with AI-generated posts. Even if you never use ChatGPT or other large language models directly, the rest of the internet is sodden with their output and with real people parroting their hallucinations. Remember: LLMs are still often wrong about basic facts. It is enough to make a person crack a book.

The internet’s slide toward AI happened quickly and deliberately. Most major platforms have integrated the technology whether users want it or not, just at the moment that some AI photos and videos have become indistinguishable from reality, making it that much harder to trust anything online. Over time, LLMs might get more accurate, or people might simply get better at spotting their tells. In the meantime, a real possibility is that people will turn to the real world as a more trustworthy alternative. We’ve been telling one another to “touch grass” for years now, all while downloading app- and website-blocking software and lockable phone safes to try to wean ourselves off constant internet use. Maybe the AI-slop era will actually help us log off.",1,1753283248.0,atlanticdiscussions,0,1.0,False

**Kendu Sneakers**

But today I am gonna focus on the new one: Handmade leather sneakers in Italy! They are made from pristine, Italian leather and also feature genuine Italian materials throughout. This is a father-son project, made by mastercraftsman. The shoes are a 70s college sports-inspired design and are great for casual activities and walking. These shoes are limited edition, collectors items so are gonna be so sought after when Kendu is in the 10s of billions... This is by far one of my favourite projects under the Kendu umbrella, they look so good and nothing beats handmade shoes. Did I mention, that all shoes are 100% returnable, no questions asked? Yep, you can order these trouble free.

You simply cannot find this Kendu mentality elsewhere and that's why we are going to the very top, Kendu is expanding into every industry in the world and it's only gonna get more and more extensive. Kendu is simply unignorable, imo our path to success is predetermined and written in the stars, I have never seen anything like this ever!

The whole thing has been on my mind 24/7 365. 

I have exams soon and need to focus my attention on it but every time I think of something else I feel so guilty.

A real genocide is happening and it’s just insane that people are going about their regular lives. This deflection, ‘oh what about hamas’, ‘they bought this on themselves’, ‘what about Sudan’ just makes it worse.

Does anyone have any tips as to how to actually deal with this? I can’t talk to my parents really about it (mum is pro Israel; although I give her the benefit of the doubt of not understanding). But there’s this wilful blindness which is so difficult to manage. So difficult not to feel furious, and to be tempered, reasonable, understanding.

I live a good life (objectively speaking) in a beautiful part of the world; yet every time I swim in the sea, or see the roses in bloom, I think about those kids having to eat sand, and cities turned to ash; how I’m just here doing nothing, and the blindness of people sunbathing and drinking their coffee.

I know it sounds absurdly obsessive; just some words of wisdom or something could help; please be kind.

They’re busy fixing their **“aesthetics.”**

Air is toxic, roads are chaos, unemployment is rising, and mental health is collapsing under digital noise —

But every second person under 25 is somewhere in Khan Market sipping overpriced coffee, filming “day in my life” reels as if they’re starring in some dystopian Netflix special called **“Main Character, Dilli Edition.”**

This generation wasn’t just given a voice — it was given a **platform, a camera, a script, and the power to change things.**

* Speak in fake accents while quoting Instagram therapists.
* Hop on protest hashtags for 24 hours before switching back to thirst traps and situationship trauma. 
* Delhi is **bleeding** —

From every pothole, every scam, every failed public transport route, every broken hospital, every woman walking home in fear.

Busy making playlists titled **“dancing while everything burns lol.”**

They scream “oppression” but have never faced actual consequences in their curated, privilege-bubble lives.

They act like survivors of trauma, but fall apart if someone doesn’t double-tap their story.



**You want real pain?**

Walk into a Delhi slum where a 14-year-old girl is the sole breadwinner.

Stand in a Sarkari hospital line for 6 hours with your dying father.

Talk to a student whose future was destroyed by a rigged exam or caste discrimination.

Then come back and tell me about your **“healing journey.”**

You post about Gaza and Kashmir but won’t speak when the police beat up students 2 km from your own campus.

You virtue-signal on Twitter but pay bribes in real life without blinking.

You hate the system but dream of becoming a **“cool IAS officer who does vlogs.”**

Your narcissism is not just cringe.

It’s a **distraction weaponized by the system.**

You’ve been fed so much therapy-speak, self-love mantras, and “protect your energy” bullshit that you’ve stopped seeing what’s right in front of you:

**A dying country.**

**A dead conscience.**

**A decaying city.**

1m7bk66,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m7bk66/my_experience_with_seasoning_my_grinder_timemore/,My Experience with Seasoning my Grinder (Timemore 078s – ~3kg in),"I was initially hesitant to season my 078s. It arrived just two days ago. My wife and I usually split a double shot daily — sometimes two — so we’re not heavy users.

I had read quite a bit on the general benefits of burr seasoning, and more specifically about the 078s (including feedback from several YouTubers). I honestly didn’t think it was necessary and figured I’d just let the grinder season naturally over time. But eventually, curiosity got me.

I found 2 forgotten 2.5 lb bags of Starbucks Winter Blend at my parents’ house. They were labeled medium roast, but looked closer to dark (typical for Starbucks). Fortunately, they were quite stale and dry — very little oil. That gave me about 2.3 kg of beans to begin with. Based on what I’d read, the consensus was anywhere from 2 kg to 7 kg for seasoning. The upper end seemed absurd to me, but I figured I could at least hit the low end.

Before I started, I pulled a baseline shot using Equator Coffees' Jaguar Espresso (a dark roast I like). It was good, but noticeably acid-forward.

For seasoning, I set the RPM to max (to speed up the process) and the grind dial to around 4.5–5. I ran both bags straight through the grinder without substantive breaks (usually a minute or two to dump the bowl filled with grinds). The whole process took maybe an hour. I didn’t bother stopping to cool the grinder. It seemed to be running fine the entire time.

Small note: the 078s did shut itself off occasionally, but I believe it was a time-based auto-shutoff rather than a thermal one. I could pretty reliably predict when it would happen, and simply turning it back on resumed grinding without issue.

After that, I ran another three 12 oz (~340 g) bags of random old coffee I had stored in the freezer — gifted beans I never wanted to brew.

The process itself was incredibly messy. Seasoning with a single-dose hopper was tedious. Popcorning made it worse. But to the grinder’s credit, it wasn’t designed to churn through 3+ kg of beans in one sitting.

After a full cleanup, I pulled another shot of Jaguar Espresso — same dose, same yield — and had to move my grind size from 2.6 (pre-seasoning) to 3.8 (post-seasoning) to hit the same shot time. That tracks, since seasoning smooths/dulls the burr edges, and finer grinds now flow more easily.

To my surprise, there was a NOTICEABLE improvement. The shot was much smoother, FAR less acid-forward, and a bit sweeter. I was honestly shocked — I didn’t buy into the seasoning “hype” at first, but this was a clear, measurable shift (and my wife agreed in a blind taste test).

If you own a 078s, I’d recommend seasoning the burrs. I think 2.5–3 kg is plenty to unlock the improved flavor and grind consistency. The 7 kg recommendation floating around feels excessive (and incredibly wasteful), but I can’t speak to that personally. What I can say is that post-seasoning, dialing in is FAR easier. Before, a 0.1 click could make a massive difference on the grind size. Now, the dial feels much more forgiving and consistent.

1m7bjmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCC_Stock/comments/1m7bjmu/core_coffee_business/,Core Coffee Business,"Would appreciate thoughts here.  

With the short term risk on cash position shored up, I would think growth in the core coffee business should be the focus for the upcoming quarterly release.  It clearly had a dip in the middle of last year. 

My observations.  Walmart, the largest customer by far is solid.  SKU counts remain in high 20’s and low 30’s in stock.  Coffee makes up majority of these.  Sam’s has the 32 oz Tactisquatch doing well.  Costco only has RTD coffee in 50 ish stores.  Big opportunity here. Target has 3 SKU’s that are new in the past quarter. Meijer, Albertsons, Safeway, Giant, etc all have been steady on coffee SKU’s.  I would estimate a mid single digit  growth in this overall segment.  Not on fire, but paying the bills.  

Energy growth is very strong and will provide much upside.

1m7biq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Timemore/comments/1m7biq6/timemore_078s_my_experience_with_seasoning_3kg_in/,Timemore 078s – My Experience with Seasoning (~3kg in),"I was initially hesitant to season my 078S. It arrived just two days ago. My wife and I usually split a double shot daily — sometimes two — so we’re not heavy users.

I had read quite a bit on the general benefits of burr seasoning, and more specifically about the 078s (including feedback from several YouTubers). I honestly didn’t think it was necessary and figured I’d just let the grinder season naturally over time. But eventually, curiosity got me.

I found 2 forgotten 2.5 lb bags of Starbucks Winter Blend at my parents’ house. They were labeled medium roast, but looked closer to dark (typical for Starbucks). Fortunately, they were quite stale and dry — very little oil. That gave me about 2.3 kg of beans to begin with. Based on what I’d read, the consensus was anywhere from 2 kg to 7 kg for seasoning. The upper end seemed absurd to me, but I figured I could at least hit the low end.

Before I started, I pulled a baseline shot using Equator Coffees' Jaguar Espresso (a dark roast I like). It was good, but noticeably acid-forward.

For seasoning, I set the RPM to max (to speed up the process) and the grind dial to around 4.5–5. I ran both bags straight through the grinder without substantive breaks (usually a minute or two to dump the bowl filled with grinds). The whole process took maybe an hour. I didn’t bother stopping to cool the grinder. It seemed to be running fine the entire time.

Small note: the 078s did shut itself off occasionally, but I believe it was a time-based auto-shutoff rather than a thermal one. I could pretty reliably predict when it would happen, and simply turning it back on resumed grinding without issue.

After that, I ran another three 12 oz (~340 g) bags of random old coffee I had stored in the freezer — gifted beans I never wanted to brew.

The process itself was incredibly messy. Seasoning with a single-dose hopper was tedious. Popcorning made it worse. But to the grinder’s credit, it wasn’t designed to churn through 3+ kg of beans in one sitting.

As someone who takes coffee seriously, investing time into creating the perfect cup is a daily ritual for me, and this compact brewer has made the process both engaging and joyfully uncomplicated. It’s a small, clear plastic device, but don’t let the simplicity fool you—this thing knows how to deliver rich, clean-tasting coffee.

**Design Worth Noting**  
The clear plastic design is simple, lightweight, and sturdy, which instantly stood out to me. While it may not have the aesthetic elegance of ceramic or glass alternatives, it absolutely makes up for it in portability. The spiral ribs on the inner walls are not just decorative; they’re methodically crafted to allow the coffee grounds to expand fully during brewing. This means you get an even extraction for a truly flavorful cup. The design includes a cone shape, which helps to concentrate the water at the center of the coffee grounds, maximizing depth in flavor. With dimensions of just 4.33 x 3.54 x 4.21 inches and weighing a mere 3.52 ounces, it’s also ridiculously easy to carry, making it perfect for traveling, camping, or even just small kitchens.

**Simplicity Meets Performance**  
Operating this coffee dripper is refreshingly straightforward, but don’t mistake simplicity for mediocrity. All it takes is a paper filter, your favorite ground coffee, and hot water. The large single hole at the bottom gives you control over the water flow. If you pour slower, your coffee becomes stronger, while a faster pour results in a lighter brew. This versatility is a game-changer, especially for someone like me who enjoys customizing coffee strengths on a whim. The added bonus is its ability to highlight delicate floral and fruity notes in specialty coffee beans—something many drip coffee makers struggle to do.

[Check Hario VD-01T price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b001hc9gic/)

**Good Points**  
- Extremely lightweight and portable, ideal for traveling or small spaces.  
- Spiral ribbed design enhances coffee ground saturation.  
- Durable plastic build ensures long-term use without fear of breaking.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Being plastic, it doesn’t retain heat as well as ceramic or metal models might.  
- Requires the use of paper filters, adding to the long-term costs and sustainability concerns.  

**Versatility of Use**  
Though it’s marketed as suitable for 1-2 cups, I’ve pushed it to make slightly more coffee when friends drop by, and it still performs wonderfully. What’s surprising is how it’s adaptable even for beginner coffee enthusiasts. A co-worker of mine, who often drinks instant coffee, brewed her first pour-over using this dripper and was blown away. The learning curve is nearly nonexistent due to the manual operation being as easy as brewing gets. However, having a proper gooseneck kettle does help, as it adds controlled precision to pouring.

**Comparing with Other Options**  
Compared to competing products like the Chemex or Kalita Wave, this coffee dripper holds its ground remarkably well. While Chemex models offer an undeniably classy look and richer flavor due to thicker paper filters, they’re also bulkier and pricier. The Kalita Wave provides a flatter bed for brewing, which some argue extracts coffee more uniformly. However, I’ve found that the spiral ribs on the Hario dripper balance flavor extraction excellently without requiring a specific, often expensive, proprietary filter. For those looking for portability and ease, this dripper stands head and shoulders above its pricier counterparts like the Aeropress, which, though versatile, involves more parts to clean and manage.

**True Value**  
Considering its quality, ease of use, and portability, the Hario VD-01T coffee dripper represents excellent value proposition for those who prioritize flavor and minimalism in brewing. Not having to worry about shattering it on a countertop or during a road trip is a big win, especially compared to pricier and more fragile competitors. The only recurring cost here is the paper filters, which are specific to this model. If you can commit to those, then there’s no reason not to go for it.

Ayumu’s house sat quiet, the morning sunlight filtering softly through the windows. Footsteps echoed down the hallway as Eijiro, Ayumu's new roommate, approached a particular door, a devilish grin tugging at his lips. He stopped, cracked his knuckles, and leaned into the doorframe.



“Time to get to work.”



Moments later in the dining room, the air was filled with the clatter of silverware and the cheerful sizzle of breakfast. Ayumu, Haruna, and Eucliwood were already seated. Haruna hummed over a towering plate of pancakes, while Eucliwood sipped her tea with her usual quiet grace.



Then came the creak of floorboards. Seraphim entered with her signature fierce stride… only something was off.



The room froze. Forks halted mid-air. Haruna’s jaw dropped. Ayumu turned beet-red and choked on his orange juice.



Seraphim’s emerald eyes narrowed dangerously as Ayumu began to stammer, face burning.



“What are you gawking at, maggot?! Speak before I split you open like firewood!”



Ayumu pointed toward the nearby mirror, blurting, “Your face! I mean... look at your face!”



Seraphim scoffed and strode over to the wall mirror by the entryway. She leaned in... and froze.



Her reflection stared back:

* Soft pink lipstick glistening on her lips
* Rosy blush blooming on both cheeks
* Vibrant blue eyeshadow swept delicately across her lids
* A smooth, doll-like glow that softened her sharp features with innocent charm

Her eye twitched. Once. Twice.



“…Who. Did. This?” she growled through gritted teeth.



Marching back to the table, she unsheathed her katana with a chilling hiss, the blade hovering inches from Ayumu’s throat as her aura darkened.



“I will bathe in your blood, you perverted maggot!”



Ayumu broke into a sweat, hands raised in surrender, voice trembling. “W-Wait! Seraphim, I swear it wasn’t me! You have to believe me!”



“I’d never touch you in your sleep, I mean, I wouldn’t dare! I mean respectfully! Please don’t kill me!”



Her voice dropped to glacial levels. “So you’re saying someone else touched me… while I was vulnerable. And you let it happen?”



Ayumu’s eyes widened in panic. “NO! I... I mean, I didn’t know! I was asleep! Probably! Maybe?!”



Haruna doubled over laughing, eventually toppling off her chair, legs flailing in the air. “Love the new look, Sera!”



Eucliwood silently held up a note in her delicate hand: *“You look like you’d lose a duel. But win a beauty pageant.”*



Seraphim turned slowly, fury radiating off her in waves. But before she could strike, Eijiro strolled in, towel over one shoulder, a mug of coffee in hand.



“Rise and shine, Lady Sera. Time to get to work.”



He leaned casually against the doorframe, as if he hadn’t just committed a ninja-level offense.



“Figured it was time someone brought out your softer side.”



Seraphim’s jaw clenched. “YOU.”



She stepped forward, katana gripped tightly, rage crackling through her every motion.



“You dare defile a vampire ninja’s dignity… paint her face like some common harlot… for your own amusement?”



Her voice dropped to a deadly whisper. “Prepare to face divine punishment.”



She stormed toward him, makeup still flawlessly intact, her face now glowing with a dangerous blend of fury and cosmetic radiance.



Eijiro backed away, palms up, eyes wide. “O-Okay, okay! I’ll take it off! Chill! It was just a joke!”

**Across the Street**

Beth liked her quiet mornings. The soft hum of the kettle, the weight of her medical textbooks in her lap, the way the sunlight filtered through her curtains just right—it was her ritual. A moment of peace before the chaos of lectures and hospital rotations.  

Then *he* moved in.

She noticed him on the third day, carrying a box into the house across the street. Tall, dark-haired, moving with the kind of quiet efficiency that suggested he’d done this before. Alone. No movers, no friends, just him.  

Something about him was familiar.  

Beth frowned, sipping her tea. Had she seen him somewhere? Campus, maybe? No, that wasn’t it. She had a good memory for faces, and his —sharp jaw, tired eyes— stuck with her. But she couldn’t place it.  


He didn’t make noise. That was the first thing Beth realized. Most new neighbors had parties, or at least loud conversations, but his presence was almost ghostly. The only sign of life was the soft glow of his living room lamp late at night and the occasional scent of coffee drifting from his open window.  

Then, one rainy afternoon, she saw him standing under the awning of a small café just a few blocks away. *His* café, she realized, reading the sign: **Hollow Grounds**.  

Of course. The quiet weirdo who worked at a coffee shop. That explained the smell.

Their eyes met through the drizzle. He offered a small smile—polite, automatic. The kind that didn’t quite reach his eyes.

Beth nodded back.

And just like that, the moment passed.

But she couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to him.",1,1753281892.0,WritingHub,2,1.0,False

Not me. Not anymore. I learned my lesson.

In 2022, I got a job offer from an entertainment news website. They offered me a full-time gig, basically. I’d have to work about 5 hours a day 6 days a week, and they’d pay me a fixed fee of $4,000 a month.

You should have seen my face when I read the email. I was holding back happy tears — I’d FINALLY landed my high-ticket client.

It wasn’t long until I sat on my couch eating whipped cream straight from the can, crying into the couch pillow.

# Great offer, great client… for a while

There was nothing wrong with the client itself. It was a reputable news website and they kept their promise. They had work for six days a week, and they paid on time. I was golden.

I felt like I finally made it. I didn’t have to worry about my bills, because I had a good high-paying client and a few smaller ones.

If you’re a freelancer, you know the financial stress we experience when we balance between finding new clients and not overbooking ourselves. We’re trying to get bills paid but not at the expense of our sanity. It’s a fun roller coaster, that one.

But I was good. I wasn’t overworked and I paid my bills.

Until one morning of May 2023, I got an email that made me sh\*t my pants and go on full blown panic-mode.

>

And this happened before I even got my morning coffee.

Of course, as you can imagine, **I lost about 60 % of my income in one email.** This happened during the time AI was taking over like a storm, the economy was crap, and it was hard as F to find any new clients or work.

What stung the most was that I had turned down other clients about a month before.

>

# I started rebuilding, and made a crucial adjustment

I walked dogs during the harshest winter months in the Northeast US. I vividly remember a day when I walked a dog through the park in 10 degree weather while it snowed sideways… for $20 an hour. Minus gas.

That night I sat on my couch eating whipped cream straight from a can while defrosting my toes.

After I was done with the can and I’d cried an ocean on my lap, I finally pulled myself together and made a new plan.

**No more high-ticket clients.**

I did the math and spoke with other freelance writers and entrepreneurs.

>

I think the reason for this is very clear: if you lose a high-ticket client instantly, it will affect your finances crucially.

Of course, there are some freelancers that would disagree. Some would prefer a few high ticket clients to a bunch of low-ticket ones.

That’s something you’ll have to figure out for yourself, but from my experience, it’s not worth it.

I’ve spoken with multiple freelancers on LinkedIn who consistenly deny offers for full-time employment, for this exact reason.

# Do your math and learn to say no

You’re going to get a ton of nice offers from clients. The most important word in your vocabulary is “no.” Not all money is good money.

Before accepting any offers, do your math. How much money do you need to cover your expenses? And will you be OK if that client leaves?

Remember to also:

* Sign contracts: Ensure that the client has to give you at least a 30-day notice
* Don’t sign a non-compete: Never, EVER sign a non-compete. You’re a freelancer, not an employee.
* Keep a waitlist/backlog of clients: Sometimes you’ll have to turn down work, but don’t burn bridges.

1m7b31c,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m7b31c/theres_someone_standing_in_front_of_my_house/,There's someone standing in front of my house every night.,"I'm not a celebrity or a high-ranking person for someone to stalk me. Heck, I'm not even a social media person, but I do have an account actually though I barely use it. So what happened the past month terrified me, that just reminiscing about it send chills to me. I'm using my account to get this nightmare off my chest, and spread awareness also. If you've encountered the same events, know that you're not alone here.

It actually started back in August. I was reading a novel on my bed to spare time. It was 10:34 that night and the blackness of the night can't seem to tire my body down. Drinking coffee before bed wasn't a good idea, but the ambiance of the night needs a hot coffee to compliment it. For what seem like a long hour, enough time had passed already. And the evening breeze is getting slightly stronger, creating sounds of trees and branches shaking. This is the indication that I should sleep already. I stood up, make my way into the small drawer beside the window when a figure outside caught my eye. At first, I thought it was an animal but as I got closer to the window to examine it, it's certainly a person. It was standing just beside the tree, not near enough but also not far. A sudden chill electrified me. Seriously, the idea of someone standing outside your house looking at you at night is terrifying. The person was not moving but I'm certain that it was staring at me. I can't discern who it was as the shade of the tree is making it hard to look. So that night, I immediately cover the windows and went straight to bed. Checking who it was in the midst of the night is something I'm super terrified of. Maybe it was just one of the neighbors pulling a prank or something.

The next day, everything went normal. What happened that night still bothered me but not to an extent where it gets me so paranoid about. Then the night came. I wasn't doing my usual night routine because a distant friend of mine called. We talked about what kind of lives we are living since we graduated from college, since we haven't been connected for years. After an hour of endless stories, we bid our goodbyes and the call ended. It was 11:47 and I went to my room. As I was fixing my bed, the window tempted me to look from it. I was curious if the person was there and the dormant fear suddenly erupted within me. But I wanted to be assured. As my eyes scanned outside, I couldn't see the person standing beside the tree. A sudden relief washed me. Maybe it was a prank all along. I leaned back from the window to finally get to bed when my heart suddenly pounded as my eyes caught something familiar. I looked again, but this time, slowly. To my utter shock, the person was there but more closer. Closer enough to reveal that it is a man. At first glance, I couldn't see the man because my eyes were focused on the tree but little did I know, it gotten closer. He was standing next to my rose garden, just blankly staring at me. I immediately turn on the lights and ran to the living room out of terror. I just know, I never slept that night.

On the third day, the effects of being awake all night struck me. My movements were a little bit heavy but I still got to work. Then the night falls again, and the same nightmare began but more intense than the previous ones. The man was getting nearer each night because this time, he was right outside my window, just ten steps ahead from the rose garden. This time, the man was looking up, staring at me. He doesn't move, he's just there stagnantly staring, examining me. That was my last straw. With shaking fingers, I immediately dialed 911. The police was certainly coming and this hell would be over. After a long hour of waiting, they did came but the man was gone. The police searched the area but they couldn't find the man. But they did see a single pair of footsteps right on the position of the man that stood there. What's puzzling is that there's no other footsteps leading up to it because the ground around the single pair of footsteps was untouched. It's like the man magically appeared there and disappeared. The thought of it intensely terrified me. The police told me to watch out for any signs of the man appearing again and notify them.

On the fourth day, It was a day where I woke up in a different room. Yes, I did booked a hotel that night because I couldn't stay in that house any longer after what just had transpired. The mornings are my safe zone, so I go to my house to suit myself up for work. The single pair of footsteps still lingered and I couldn't stare at it for too long. The night came and I decided to stay at home, because I had to notify the police if the man showed up again for this to be over. I just had to bear my fear. My eyes were focused on the way to my room as I was walking, avoiding peeking at any sides. I slowly opened the door of my room, with my eyes till looking straight into the bed. When I entered, the intense fear was creeping upon me.

The bed.

The pictures on the wall.

The corner of the room.

And then, the window.

The fear instantly paralyzed me. Unable to move, even to run as my gaze was chained to what I saw in the window. The man was right in front of it, just the glass dividing us. I couldn't comprehend how the man was literally in front of my window as there's no roof or a platform that can make him stand there. The realization of it all layered my trembling body. He was floating. I didn't waste any second, I immediately got out of my room shaking, then ran towards the backdoor to escape the monstrosity. I hit the road and sweared to never come back again.

And still, to this present day, that moment still haunts me.",2,1753281692.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False
1m7b1r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1m7b1r2/he_reached_out_after_4_months_of_silence/,He Reached Out After 4 Months of Silence,"You can check out my post history for the background on my saga. The short version is that I was friends with this man (44M, FA) for a year, then we dated for 8 months. 4 months were great, the last 4 were a push-pull mess. He discarded via text in March, then stonewalled and ghosted. He just popped back up after 4 months of silence.

For additional background, I am 34F, generally secure. Definitely showed anxious traits in this dynamic. I am polyamorous. This man knew that and actively pursued me. I had no interest beyond friendship initially. (This detail will make more sense later).

So, after 4 months of silence, I get a random email in my spam folder that says ""Hey there, it's \_\_\_\_\_, how are you?"" I was baffled that he reached out via email, as we never communicated that way. In fact, he only had my email address because I sent him a google drive file once. I knew pretty quickly this would probably be breadcrumbs, but I had waited months to hear from him and knew he'd be cautious as a severe FA, so I rolled with it.

We chatted cordially for a few days. He got injured at work, and started thinking of me while laid up. This felt pretty typical FA, too. He's a workaholic single dad who barely stops to breathe, so he finally had to address suppressed feelings when he was stuck in the hospital with nothing else to do.

**I noticed right away that his messages were self-centered.** He talked a lot about what was going on in his life, but barely asked about me, and did not apologize. It did surprise me that he admitted to thinking of me often and missing me very much, since he's not one to be emotionally forthcoming. After admitting that, his tone shifted to more reserved and formal, and I knew he had reached his emotional limit and was going to pull back.

Finally, after a week of surface-level chatting, I suggested we meet for coffee. He sad it would be ""great to catch up sometime when life calms down."" That's basically how he strung me along for months before, and **I knew he was future faking**. I decided it was beyond time to ask for clarity and set boundaries.

I kindly asked why he reached out. If he was hoping to reconnect or just checking in. I got a long message back indicating that he was sorry for the way things left off (when he discarded), and he wanted to apologize. He indicated that he cares about me very much and I am the first person to care about him the way he has always longed for, especially after his traumatic divorce 5 years ago. He also indicated that while he thinks we are perfect for one another, he'd rather not date someone poly right now.

I was both sad and livid. People are welcome to change their minds and not pursue poly dynamics, but he is clearly jus using that excuse as a crutch. He pursued me knowing I was poly, so he really has no leg to stand on with that excuse. He's just fault-finding and justifying his actions with a built-in escape hatch.

I sent a reply that maturely and firmly pointed out all of the inconsistencies in his behavior. He claimed he reached out to apologize... but only apologized after I asked for clarity days after he contacted me. He claims he isn't into dating someone poly... but actively pursued his close poly friend. I told him that I don't believe our dynamic is the issue, but rather the walls he built to protect himself. Without getting into attachment, I told him that armor is great for protection, but there comes a point where it keeps us stuck. I encouraged him to consider his actions and consider why he really reached out. **Then I let him know that I was finally setting a firm boundary. I would not be waiting, chasing, or holding space for him.** I told him the only way I would ever respond again is if he did the work to address his trauma and reached out with the intention of seeing me in-person to have a conversation. I literally will not reply to anything that does not meet those conditions going forward. And I don't anticipate that happening.

So I am finally done with hope for this man. I cared very much for him and wish him well, but I won't allow him in my life again unless he does some radical self-work first. Even then, I am pretty turned off by his behavior at this point, so I hope to be well moved on by the time he gets around to addressing his wounds.

This was a difficult, but great learning experience. **I did all the messy things people don't recommend: breaking no contact, holding hope, justifying his withdrawal** due to extreme life stress, etc. **It has been hard, but I don't regret any of it.** I came out of the experience with emotional resilience, a stronger sense of self, firmer boundaries, and a better awareness of red flags not to overlook in the future. I trusted that a friend would not hurt me this way, but this made me understand that **unaddressed trauma will inevitably cause harm, no matter how much two people care about one another.**

While I won't be his free validation vending machine anymore, I am glad that he felt loved for the first time in a very long time. I hope that our connection showed him what genuine care feels like, even if he didn't know how to accept it or reciprocate. Maybe he'll learn from losing our relationship and decide to make changes so that he can have more secure love in the future. It just likely won't be with me.

I am actively trying to stay off of this sub now. I understand FA and DA behavior, and this sub really helped me see how the patterns unfold. I thought for sure my person was different and wouldn't behave this way, but he hit pretty much every stereotypical phase of FA behavior. When we love someone, it's easy to fall  into thinking ""but this person is different!"" And yes, each individual is nuanced, but both DA and FA patterns are so deeply ingrained that it takes extreme self-awareness and willingness to change to move forward.

**It's okay if you need to hold hope for awhile. You'll eventually hit something that breaks the spell this person has over you.** For me, it was seeing that after months of silence, he only reached out to soothe his own guilt and receive validation while he was feeling low. He didn't appear to even consider how his reaching out after all this time might give me false hope. **I don't have space in my life for someone who won't consider me with basic respect and care.**

So this is where this journey ends, and where my personal journey begins - free from anticipating his messages and moods, free from hoping he'll reach out, free from wishing things were different. Things are as they are, and I trust that something more aligned awaits me. I hope it awaits you, too.",10,1753281613.0,AvoidantBreakUps,3,0.92,False

For some context, I'd tasted a version of this coffee whilst traveling through the UK in a cafe called The Yard in Salisbury. The proprietor of that cafe was one of the most sincere and committed coffee lovers I've met. We had some great conversation and he mentioned using a Lance Hedrick recipe for brewing the coffee and I must say it was absolutely delicious! The guava taste was striking and very front & centre. My experience there was the main reason I decided to purchase this coffee. 

I have an Ode Gen 1 with SSP MP burrs, set to 7-1 clicks and I brewed this with a Kalita wave 185, water temp 201 F. Water used was distilled with Coffee Water mineral packs. 

My recipe was: 1:15 ration (20g -> 300g), 60g bloom for 90s with light WDT to mix. Second pour to 150g with low agitation, then 50g increments to 300g. Draw down ended up being slower than expected, I suspect due to chaffs from the beans and some fines, cumulative brew time including bloom was 5:30. The cup was delicious, but didn't have the striking guava notes I recollect. I'd love to get some of your advice on how I can change my recipe to accentuate the guava notes. 

Thank you!",2,1753281428.0,pourover,4,0.67,False

Honestly, it is the easiest coffee maker I have ever owned, and I’ve had it for approximately seven years. It is essentially indestructible and does not require any replacement filters or electronics. I simply clean it off and give the mesh filter a weekly scrub, and it's ready to use. The simplicity of the design is kind of lovely. 

When I was searching for a spare to carry at work, I actually came across a design that looked comparable on Alibaba. I mean, tons of them. Nevertheless, even the most expensive models don't feel as sturdy or heavy as the build quality of my original one.

It helped me realize that low maintenance is more about how well something is manufactured than it is about the brand or price. Not a single moving part. No power cables. Just clever design and sturdy metal. What is your ""set it and forget it"" item, may I ask? That one item you use frequently but hardly ever have time to maintain, repair, or consider?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **San Francisco Giants vs. Atlanta Braves: A Tale of Two Pitchers and a Relentless Giants’ Rally**

**Parse the Odds**  
The Atlanta Braves (-150) are the chalk here, with moneyline odds of 1.6 (implied probability: \~62.5%), while the Giants (+242) are the underdogs after their 9-0 shutout victory. The spread favors Atlanta (-1.5 runs) at -220, with San Francisco (+1.5) at +169. The total is set at 8.5 runs, with the Over at 1.95 (\~51.3%) and Under at 1.87 (\~53.5%).

Key stats: The Giants have won five of Landen Roupp’s last six starts, but this game features **Justin Verlander** (Giants) vs. **Spencer Strider** (Braves). Both are aces, but Verlander’s recent performance? Let’s just say he’s the “vintage wine” of pitchers—still potent, but with a hint of “I’ve seen this lineup before.” Meanwhile, the Giants’ offense, which clobbered Atlanta last time, is riding high, while the Braves’ bats look like a broken sprinkler: wetting the field but missing the target.

**Digest the News**  
The Giants’ recent win was a masterclass in efficiency: four pitchers combined for 14 strikeouts, and Rafael Devers (yes, the Red Sox’s star, now playing first base like he’s auditioning for a Giants’ Hall of Fame statue) was error-free. Manager Bob Melvin, now tied for 20th in career wins, is clearly on a mission to out-coach everyone in MLB.

For the Braves? The news is… sparse. They lost 9-0 last time, and their offense has the energy of a sloth on a coffee break. Strider, their ace, will start, but even his fastball looks tired after facing the Giants’ recent .183 batting average.

**Humorous Spin**  
The Giants’ pitching staff is like a relief choir: harmonizing strikeouts and shutting d

Do you enjoy relatively hard sci-fi detective-noir stories set in the near future, with enough humor to leaven the final product? This tale is set in the world of tomorrow; one shackled to the problems of today. A world bound by the laws of thermodynamics, where faster-than-light travel is the stuff of science fiction and teleportation is a mad fever dream. This story takes place in the next century, where late-stage capitalism and increasing reliance on genetic and cybernetic optimization has produced a mistrusted transhuman minority class. This is a world where the promise of a better tomorrow has been broken to pieces, where science couldn't lift humanity beyond our nature, or even beyond our solar system.*

*\\Where humanity previously surged from Earth on waves of subliminal chemical rockets and fusion engines, surfing the tsunami of accelerated scientific development, we now stagnate. The collapse of the tech bubble and the following economic crash precede years of armed conflict, leaving humanity scattered across the solar system in an aborted diaspora. In a society where life is cheap and everything else is expensive, an increasingly cyber-civilization wars with itself as unmodified humans retaliate against a future that left them behind.*

*This is a world in which technology has improved by leaps and bounds, but where people are still chained to the economic systems we 'enjoy' today. It's a world where unmodified (or 'baseline') humans find their abilities increasingly obsolete, and their skillsets ever less competitive in job markets filled with made-to-order AI. In this world, in defiance of the saccharine dreams of futurists and transhumanists and tech-cultists everywhere, utopia remains a fantasy. In a time when technology has advanced to the point of human-mind uploading and interplanetary travel, capitalism is still king.*

*The creaking, ad-hoc system flounders at the straining limits of its decaying reach. Oligarchs and mega-corporations feud over the isolated clusters of civilization among the void. A pseudo-government, formed to reign in the remnants of armed conflict and underground factions, finds itself policing a semi-lawless frontier beyond the core planets. Code Enforcement Officers desperately try to stem the tide of malware, hackers, and evolving synthetic life undermining the digital systems on which humanity relies. But don't worry; even in the darkness of the future, for the beleaguered digital cop, there will still be coffee.*

**Synopsis:**

Both as a cop and a person, Lieutenant Mel Cruz is consistently dealt a crap hand.  She's a jaded officer coming to terms with the wreckage of her romantic life, a near fatal injury, and an acerbic new captain.  Following her transfer to a new unit, she desperately tries to hold her life together while rebuilding her career.  Oh, and she's a 34-year-old Scouting Officer for the Code Enforcement branch of the Exonet Maintenance Bureau.  To put it in Luddite, she's a cyborg law enforcement officer, and digital systems are her beat.

Follow our protagonist on a journey of healing and found family, as well as terrifying and profound explorations of the nature of humanity and sentience.  Lieutenant Cruz will have to adjust to life in the sticks of the Jovian system, build relationships with her colleagues, and still manage her weekly caseload of digital crimes.  A.I.s and humans alike will feature prominently in a story where the characters must weigh the measure of non-human life.  And behind the innocent facade of this backwater mining port lurks something new and dark that's eating out the heart of Ursa Miner Station.

Be prepared for snark, LGBTQ+ themes, occasional violence, and lots of cyber-everything in a relatively hard sci-fi shell!

I am at my absolute happiest when I’m there visiting the farmers market, grabbing a coffee at wild iris cafe, kayaking to caladesi island etc. 

But I would love some advice … 

- Are all the neighborhoods generally safe? Can I go walking on the trails and feel safe? 

- Weather-wise, is it safe to buy there? I’m looking at houses not in a flood zone but I know that’s no guarantee.

- Are there young-ish people (30s-40s) to meet & date? I’ve been doing life on my own for years and while I’m happy being alone, I eventually want to find someone to settle down with. Is the dating scene viable? 

- Are people generally welcoming? Will I be able to make friends? Cause I won’t know anyone moving down there and will be leaving my family behind. 

- Is it a dog friendly town? 

I probably have more questions but those are my biggest ones. Thank you so much in advance!!

1. 94% say it's not okay to walk around barefoot in common areas. Keep those feet covered, please!

AFO looks at Tomura, who returned from the USJ incident with Kurogiri.  
  
For AFO, this was normal, almost routine. It wasn't the first time last week Tomura was humiliated. Once, a troop of Girl Scouts humiliated him because Tomura criticized some cookies.  
  
""Sensei, I think Tomura needs some words of encouragement."" **Kurogiri says, embarrassed, looking at AFO, who is eating the same cookies from the Girl Scout troop that Tomura criticized. They really weren't that bad; they had chocolate chips and were filled with cream.**  
  
AFO looks at Kurogiri. AFO wanted a nomu who would be 100% loyal to Tomura and partly to him, but Kurogiri always defending Tomura when he messed up had AFO tired.  
  
""Look, I don't want to be really honest because sometimes you can be too honest and make a person distance themselves from you because sometimes they take honesty too strongly and think it's criticism."" **AFO says as he pours himself some coffee from a vending machine that has**

""TOMURA DO NOT TOUCH"" written on it.  
  
AFO sighs as he eats the cookies and occasionally dips some in the coffee... some childish habits don't die and stay with you your whole life.  
  
""You are REALLY replaceable."" **AFO looks at Tomura as he continues eating his cookies.**  
  
Tomura, on the other hand, doesn't take this well one bit.

""SENSEI, YOU'VE TOLD ME ALL MY LIFE THAT I'M GOING TO MAKE YOUR PLAN COME TRUE!"" **Tomura yells in a fit of childish rage.**  
  
Meanwhile, AFO walks over and leaves his coffee and box of cookies on a shelf and searches for a notebook on which he has written:  
  
""Contingency plans that I have to make just in case Tomura screws everything and I have to rush out to fix everything at the last minute.""  
  
AFO searches the pages. There are many things, such as plans to kill All Might, plans to get the cookie recipe from the Girl Scout troop that humiliated Tomura, his personal schedule where he plays the piano, violin, and other instruments.  
  
""Aha! This was the page."" **AFO smiles, looking at a page with writing on it.**  
  
""List of replacements for Tomura.""  
  
AFO grabs a glass of water and starts to recite his list.  
  
""Let's see, first there's Soichi Kaminaga who has a quirk that turns him into a nuclear reactor with legs and he's actually a very good guy only if you ignore that he has to live wearing an armor so he doesn't kill you with radiation."" **AFO says while looking at a photo of him and Kaminaga in a bowling alley smiling with a trophy, that day he had lied to Tomura that he was ""busy""**

Tomura clenches his fists in anger as he looks at Kaminaga's photo. Why did All For One have such a strong father vibe? He's never seen his teacher so happy in a photo.  
  
""There's also Harumi Tendo. Her Quirk turns her body into ink and allows her to mold that ink and even give it different properties, including being able to transform into other people."" **AFO reads the page as it shows a photo of Harumi in a dress and AFO standing next to her, smiling at a fashion show. AFO also has the vibe of being a proud father, but this time of his daughter.**  
  
Tomura tries to refute, but Kurogiri stops him in his tracks by putting his hand on his shoulder to keep him from speaking.  
  
""Oh, there's also Shun Seiwa. His Quirk allows him to control lava and obsidian like armor. He lost his parents in a forest fire."" **AFO says, smiling as he looks at a photo of him and Shun cooking in a chef competition.**  
  
Tomura realizes that... AFO has thousands upon thousands of potential successors in case he screws up... sometimes honesty hurts.  
  
AFO cares more for the replacements he has in case Tomura screws up than for Tomura himself... even the Girl Scouts who humiliated Tomura are on the list as potential successors.",26,1753281059.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,3,0.97,False

1m7at13,https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1m7at13/understand_95_of_french_but_cant_speak_ithow_long/,"Understand 95% of French, But Can’t Speak It—How Long to Fluency?","
Bonjour! Given my background, I’m wondering how long it might take me to become fluent in French.

My mom is French, so I grew up hearing the language constantly. I understand French almost as well as English. I can watch movies, TV shows, or listen to political and scientific podcasts and understand about 95% of what’s being said. It takes more effort than English, but I rarely need to pause or look things up. I passively understand French well.

That said, this comprehension doesn’t carry over into speaking. My vocabulary is decent, but my speaking is well below conversational. I make many grammatical mistakes, have a weak pronunciation, and have a strong accent. My reading is solid (I recently visited a museum in Paris and could understand all the exhibit labels), but my writing is pretty weak.

It often feels like I “know” French until I try to speak it.

I plan to work with a tutor and practice more actively, especially grammar and conversation. I hope to become fluent: to speak more comfortably, write more clearly, and sound more natural. I’m not aiming for perfection, but I’d like a more neutral, less heavy accent.

Given all of this, how long might it take to reach fluency, which means being able to speak fluidly, write clearly, and sound more natural?

A few more details:
I’m generally a slow learner. I have struggled with transferring grammar knowledge from paper to speech. I have taken French classes but have never committed to them in a sustained or serious way.

When I say I’m below conversational, I mean I often struggle to find the right words when speaking, even though I recognize them if someone offers help. I make basic mistakes, like using the wrong gender for coffee, hotel, etc, and I can’t really explain why I say things a certain way. I don’t usually aim for grammatical correctness when I speak, because I don’t feel I know what’s right. I go off of “vibes,” and my sentences are probably 30–70% correct.

1m7asaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporeairlines/comments/1m7asaw/questions_about_traveling_with_powder_supplements/,Questions about traveling with powder supplements (preworkout / powdered peanut butter),"I'm going to Singapore for two months, travelling from the UK. I have a bunch of health conditions and digestive disorders that I won't bore you with, but to cut a long story short, I wanted to bring a huge jar of powdered peanut butter (it's like peanut flour?) and maybe one and a half jars of pre workout with me. The powdered peanut butter is because it's one of my only safe foods when I have a bad flare, and the pre workout is because I can't tolerate coffee and energy drinks make me bloated, but I do pretty well with this one specific brand.

I could technically buy the powdered peanut butter over there, but I already have an unopened jar and it's a lot more expensive over there. I can't find the exact same brand of the pre workout in singapore, and I don't really want to replace it with another one because a lot of other brands have set off my symptoms.

Basically, I wanted to know if carrying all this powder was going to end up causing me problems at the airport, and if you can give me any advice for avoiding any extra delays.

The powdered peanut butter is going to be unopened in its original container, so it's clearly labeled as powdered peanut butter and has the ingredients on it and everything. The jar contains 750g.

The pre workout is by the brand C4 and idk if i'm just being stupid and paranoid but i was worried the brand name would get me in trouble, hahaha. I was planning on peeling off most of the original label and only keeping the nutritional label and then attaching a sticker that just says ""PRE WORKOUT APPLE FLAVOUR"". The original label says ""explosive energy"" all over it and i feel like i'm asking for trouble by not removing it lol. i think each jar is about 350g and I'll probably have like one full one and a half empty one. should i also include all the ingredients on the jar?

I was going to put all of them in my checked bag, not my cabin bag.

idk am i doing anything wrong? please tell me if i'm completely screwing myself over somehow, or if there's a better way to handle this. inb4 reddit calls me stupid and paranoid or tells me to get over my digestive disorders and not bother trying.

Many people wonder what the benefits are, having been told from infancy that a cup of coffee will keep you out of heaven, etc. 

Harvard just released a huge study (47,000+ women) showing amazing benefits of coffee consumption, including excellent bio health markers such as lower risk of heart disease, diabetes, frailty, mental decline. Every addl small cup of caffeinated coffee (up to 8 oz/day) added 2-5% increased likelihood of being in the most healthy group in the study. (Correlation, not causation, but agrees with many other studies)

(In contrast, each 12oz  soda/day increases risk of dropping out of that group by 20-26%!!!)

-NOLA: It’s a subtle flavor (apparently chicory?) but I really like it! I’m not a huge Blue Bottle fan but this one surprised me. Made it with brown sugar for sweetener. I’m going to reorder this!

**Why This Pick?**

These two squads have cashed the Over in both games of this series so far, and I have no doubt they do the same today. I’ll be honest – I don’t love this evening’s starters. Guardians pitcher Slade Cecconi (3.84 ERA) gave up 6 runs to the Athletics in his last outing, while Baltimore starter Zach Eflin (5.95 ERA) has given up a whopping 17 runs over his last 3 starts. I know the Orioles have been pretty terrible since returning from the break, but they tend to put enough runs on the board to contribute to a high-scoring affair. To boot, the last 6 straight encounters between the Orioles and Guardians in Cleveland have seen at least 9 runs. My money’s on the Over to hit here, friends.

* *But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead. He is the first of a great harvest of all who have died.*

**The resurrection of Christ is the cornerstone of the gospel.**

Paul makes it clear that if the resurrection didn’t happen, there’s no salvation. “If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is useless, and so is your faith. You are still in your sins.”

If Christ had not risen, those who have died in Him would have perished. But because Christ has been raised from the dead, the first to rise from those who have died, your faith is not in vain, and your hopes are secure. You are no longer in your sins, and your redemption is assured. Those who have died in Christ are not lost; they are alive forever.

1m7anfw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JMfnw43o0Y,The Matrix Resurrections - The Binary Cut by Baliscon,"Hello all!

This is an idea that's been cooking for one month shy of two years, ever since I first released a combination of the second and third Matrix films called The Matrix Reloaded Resolved.  While I enjoyed the overall aspect and certain concepts from the fourth film, Resurrections, I felt that it lacked the visceral action of the original trilogy, and also fell short of offering the same expert blend of sci-fi and philosophy.

I originally considered trying to make a 50/50 split of Matrix Resurrections and the John Wick films, but I couldn't quite nail down a narrative that would allow the story to cut back and forth between both worlds and still make sense.  Then I started wondering how I could open up the story of Resurrections even further, including a total of 4 or 5 other films/franchises.  Because if combining two different movies was too tough, then combining more would surely be easier, right? 

I focused on the concept of the modal that Bugs finds Morpheus coded inside.  This idea of a Matrix within a Matrix, with characters reflected and refracted inside of alternate, pocket realities, allowed me to find ways of inserting outside footage that not only strengthened Neo's plight and character arc, but Morpheus's and Smith's too but featuring footage from films featuring actors who played these characters. This edit doesn't offer a straight-forward narrative, but my favorite part of the first Matrix film was that it didn't concern itself with being sensical either.  My hope is that this edit offers a more exciting, intriguing presentation of Matrix Resurrections. 

Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy the show!

\- Remove Jude calling Trinity a ""total effin MILF"" at the coffee shop  
\- When Tom notices his modal's been hacked, cut to a sequence compiled from Candyman 2021, where Anthony works to create a new art show, only to be harshly reviewed by a local critic.  He then begins a sketch in front of a mirror, only to scrutinize his reflection  
\- Cut to the opening of Matrix Resurrections, where Bugs infiltrates the Matrix modal that the new Morpheus inhabits

\- Cut back to Candyman footage of Anthony painting, disassociating with reality, seeing others' reflections in the mirror, and confronting his art critic  
\- Cut back to Bugs and Morpheus in the modal.  Once Morpheus falls out of the Matrix with Bugs' help, cut to a montage form Hearts and Bones, depicting Hugo Weaving's character dealing with ordinary life until coming into conflict with his PTSD, undergoing a medical examination, and receiving a diagnosis with his wife  
\-Intercut scenes from Smith's last battle with Neo in Matrix Revolutions when Weaving's character reflects on his military background  
\- Removed all archival footage of Smith when Tom first confronts his boss, the reason being to make Smith's new identity slightly more ambiguous for a slightly longer amount of time  
\- Added two sequences when Tom first meets the Analyst, one of John Wick battling the Marquis' hitman and another of Neo fighting the upgraded Agents

Wick finally reaches the doctor, played by the same actor as the Keymaker.  After being treated, John wakes up in the real world  
\- After Neo talks to Morpheus in the construct, cut to a scene from 47 Ronin, added as a training module for Neo to complete.  The scene depicts him negotiating and battling a demon while his men face a connected trial  
\- When Smith calls Neo a balding old man, cut to shots of Hugo Weaving from earlier in the edit, implying that Neo could also be connected to Smith's modal reality/persona  
\- While Smith and Neo fight, added a sequence from 47 Ronin where Kai, played by Keanu, battles a samurai, before cutting back to Neo first using his telekinetic abilities against Smith  
\- Removed Bugs' role in rescuing Trinity.  She's present at her rescue but doesn't trade places with Trinity to remove her from The Matrix  
\- Deemphasized the other captains in Neo's final act confrontation against the Analyst - If these characters had a greater impact on the film then their presence would be more necessary.  None of their characters have arcs, even as minor as Cipher's, or memorable moments, even as minor as Switch's.  The film and edit are centered on Neo and how necessary Trinity is to his life

1m7amnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/OT42/comments/1m7amnk/how_it_pays_off_for_relatable_reese_to_keep_her/,How it pays off for Relatable Reese to keep her fans on edge about her health,"Reese Quibell started talking about being a diabetic shortly after coming on Aaron's channel for the first time. This post details how Reese keeps her fans constantly on edge about her health and feeling like they need to send her superchats to give her medical advice, money for food or reminders to drink water. One fan sent her a superchat large enough to buy a microwave, thinking they were saving Reese from having to eat peanut butter and jelly. She also makes fans feel very defensive on her behalf. They get angry at her doctors, critics and even at other fans who leave comments Reese doesn't like.  
  
Reese snacked on candy corn during an early stream with Aaron and got hugely offended when some of Aaron's fans said it was gross to see and hear her eating on camera. Reese claimed that viewers were leaving comments under Aaron's video that she was a fat pig who couldn't refrain from eating for a couple of hours.   
  
Many of her viewers, including me, were unhappy to hear that. So I went to read the comments that upset her so much, and they were tame compared to what Reese had described to her audience multiple times. For me, that was one of the first red flags that what Reese says can't be trusted because she exaggerates so much for sympathy.

Reese shared about how scared she was anytime she went to the doctor because she was afraid she would be told that she has cancer. Scientology teaches people that if they leave, they'll get cancer and die, so Reese talking about that was relatable.   
  
She said she got her bloodwork done every three months and she expressed concern sometimes about her A1C level. Reese shared a lot of medical details with her fans and asked for a bunch of advice.   
  
Many fans who are also diabetic or who are medical professionals gave her helpful guidance about strength training, getting some exercise every day and tips on changing her diet and how to manage her nutrition better. From what Reese says, she has taken very little of that advice to heart, but I do believe that she started taking longer walks with her dogs almost every day once she moved to her mom and stepdad's cattle ranch.

From the beginning, Reese talked a lot about eating candy, fast food and other empty calories. She said she has the palate of a child because she grew up feeding herself Spaghetti-Os and canned soup while waiting for her father to come home after leaving her alone for days at a time. Thousands of viewers felt sorry for her and wanted to help her. They joined her Facebook group and sent her emails, gifts, cards, Amazon wish list items, superchats and cash.

She talked about cooking quite often when she lived in Kansas City, but that changed when she moved to Tennessee. All of a sudden, the sadfishing about her diabetes ramped way up.

Right after her move, Reese said she was “very, very very worried financially. I’m out in the middle of nowhere. Where am I going to get a job? How am I going to support myself?"" She looked very sad and stressed out. Once fans were sufficiently worried about her finances, Reese started talking about her diabetes. 

She said she and H were about to get kicked off her ex-husband's health insurance and she was taking her mom's prednisone without a prescription or doctor's appointment. Her fans started panicking because that can cause a medical crisis for a diabetic.

Reese bought peanut butter and jelly that day ""even though it's terrible for my diabetes,"" she said. Reese explained she was eating that because she didn't have a microwave. So fans offered to buy her one, even though another viewer sent her a $200 superchat days before specifically for a kitchen appliance.

When a fan gave her enough money in that stream to pay for a microwave, Reese thanked them and claimed she thought she was going to have to live without one. She said that with a straight face even though she had just moved two truckloads of stuff from Kansas City.

Many of her fans didn't seem to know then that Reese comes from extremely wealthy parents who have made sure since before H was born that she and H have everything they need and a lot of things they want. 

Reese makes very reckless choices with her health and makes it sound to her fans like she doesn't have enough money to pay for follow-up doctor visits or a medical emergency. That makes her fans worry so they send her more money, which she wastes on stuff she doesn't need.

About eight months ago when Reese surprised her fans by traveling to Florida to do ""Reese on the Streets"" streams with Aaron, he said that Reese wouldn't eat his cooking. ""If it's not deep-fried or come in a wrapper, Reese won't eat it,"" Aaron said. Reese said that's a lie because if something is deep-fried, she shits her pants.  
  
Then Reese said that trip to Clearwater had been really weird for her in terms of eating because they didn't eat out at all. She said on Wednesday she ate half a can of Pringles and two packets of Gushers, a fruit-flavored snack. On Thursday, she ate some chips and salsa plus two pieces of Swiss cheese at Aaron's house. ""It got weird real fast. I don't know what Aaron's hangup is about going to get food, but he doesn't like to do it,"" she said.   
  
Reese should have packed some healthy, shelf-stable snacks. To hear a diabetic talk about eating like this is very concerning to a lot of people and it's a long-standing pattern for Reese. She'll say on streams that she hasn't eaten yet that day or that she's only had a small snack, a can of soup or some fried green tomatoes.

Sometimes Reese goes the opposite direction in talking about food. She has always said she hates to pay for food herself. She said weeks ago that she's excited to go grocery shopping from her mom's garden. Reese listed off a bunch of vegetables that her mom is growing and says she's going to eat for free this summer.

About six months ago, Reese said she was at her doctor's office for hours that day and she got nervous that she was possibly dying. Her doctor wanted to put her on a statin and a blood pressure medication to try to prevent high cholesterol and high blood pressure because she's diabetic. She said she gave the doctor some pushback and got some pushback herself. 

Reese said she asked her doctor about taking supplements instead because she's concerned that if she takes those drugs she could have suicidal thoughts as a side effect. She said her doctor laughed at her and they argued. Her chat was angry at her doctor and giving Reese a bunch of suggestions about supplements that she could try.   
  
Reese said she was probably going to have to find a new doctor because that doctor was insisting that even if Reese loses weight and changes her diet she still needs to take a statin and blood pressure medication. Her A1C level had gone up, she said, and she told her doctor that her stress level is higher than it's ever been and her diet isn't great. Reese said she's lost six pounds and something's wrong because she's still not interested in food.

Reese did fire that doctor. She claimed that her cholesterol level was borderline that day, not high. But less than two weeks ago, Reese said she got her bloodwork back and her cholesterol is high. She said she told her new doctor that it's always high and just not to look at it.

When her new doctor's office wanted to do a follow-up appointment with her to discuss her bloodwork, Reese got frustrated. ""This kind of feels like a fucking scam to me,"" Reese said, adding that she doesn't want to do another co-pay for an office visit.

I haven't heard Reese mention how often she checks her blood sugar levels, but she said that her new doctor wants her to use a different monitoring device. She took a phone call during a stream and said the pharmacy was out of the test strips she needed.

In a stream later that week, Reese suddenly announced that she hasn't had any food or water all day and she asked if her viewers would mind if she goes to get a probiotic drink because she thinks her blood sugars are off. She insisted she didn't need to eat, but she came back in with an Olipop soda and a piece of cheese, some of which she fed to her pets.

That was the same stream when Reese chose to talk about the birth trauma she had with H for the first time. Fans were already gathered in Tennessee that day to meet up with Reese, but she did this long stream at home and said she wasn't going to go to the hotel until all of the fans coming to the meet-up had arrived.

Reese said she's been noticing that she feels like she needs to catch her balance sometimes when she's streaming, and that's why she was concerned about her bloodwork days before. She thought her A1C might have shot up, but it didn't. Reese admitted that maybe she needs to be on a better eating schedule. Her chatters were asking her to check her blood sugar levels and eat something before livestreams.

She said she forgets to drink water sometimes until 7 o'clock at night and threw in that she's not drinking electrolytes anymore. Reese used to have quite a few electrolyte items on her Amazon wishlist, but after she brought Finn home she changed her wishlist to focus only on her pets and not herself and H. I'm guessing that some fans sent her the electrolytes she likes after that stream because last week she said she was drinking electrolytes again.

Reese could easily keep some almonds and a bottle of water nearby anytime she's streaming, but she doesn't want to do that because she wants her fans to be worried about her. She said H gets mad at her for forgetting to drink water. ""I drink a cup of coffee every morning and that's it,"" she said, adding that sometimes she only drinks one glass of water a day.

Reese then asked anyone who has her phone number to text her and remind her to drink water. A nurse sent Reese a superchat saying that dehydration is serious and she'll remind her to drink and other superchats reminding Reese to drink water came in that stream as well as later streams.

At the meet-up the next day, her chat was asking if she's drinking water and she dodged the question. A little while later, a fan brought Reese a bottle of water and she took a sip so some of her fans in the chat would stop bugging her about getting dehydrated again.

Reese said the ice cream shop where she and her fans are makes shakes now and she's excited about that. One of her main superchatters immediately spent $10 and told Reese to get a shake.

At the hotel late that night, Reese was drinking a Shirley Temple and saying she was hungry. Reese confirmed that the fans spoiled her rotten that weekend, bringing her gifts and a birthday cake as well as buying things for her when she said she was thinking about getting something for herself. They also paid for her meals. A fan said the only thing Reese bought for herself all weekend was her own coffee.

Reese said in a very emotional stream last week that she was severely dehydrated. Reese complained that since she got up that morning, she'd had a headache so bad that it feels like she has an ax in her head. She was also having terrible leg cramps, she said. Reese admitted she didn't drink any water at all the day before and barely drank water the day before that. That is so dangerous for a diabetic.   
  
She insisted she doesn't think she has a blood clot and that she knows her body. Even with a bunch of fans sending her many reminders a day to drink water, she still wasn't doing that.

In my opinion, fans shouldn't reward Reese for getting dehydrated and not making some healthier changes to her diet. She loves it when fans worry about her and is continually coming up with reasons for them to do that. She wants them to take care of her emotionally and financially, but she doesn't really want their reminders or advice. Reese wants their engagement and she's brilliant about getting it.

Reese has complained several times over the past few months that she has crappy health insurance, but she and H have Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance that she has said even helps pay for her therapy sessions.   
  
When she was telling the story about H's birth, Reese described being put into a very nice suite at the hospital for several days. That's the luxurious level of health care she's used to and feels entitled to have while many of Reese's fans are on Medicare or get their insurance through the Affordable Care Act.

Right after her move to Tennessee when she was worrying her fans sick that she and H weren't going to have health insurance in about a week, people in her chat were trying to help her. Reese said she didn't know what to do. “I’m diabetic and I need my medication,” she said. Her chat suggested the Affordable Care Act, and she said she didn’t want to sign up for that. “I was told that’s not the best route,” she said.

Not long after that, Reese said she did reach out about Affordable Care Act health insurance options. She claimed the cheapest option to cover herself and H would cost $900 a month. Reese said there was no way she could afford that and she has so many other bills to pay and she doesn't know how she's going to do it. She said maybe she'll only get health insurance for H, but she really needs it too because she's diabetic.

Not long after that stream, Reese announced that her stepdad had given her a small part-time job so she and H had health insurance. She started talking about wanting to replace her perfectly good Honda CRV with a newer model and her subscriber numbers began dropping. The number of subs for Relatable Reese has never recovered since then and instead has continued to slowly but steadily decline. 

Reese keeps insisting that she doesn't grift or sadfish. She said she has never claimed to be poor so people would buy her things, but this post proves that she's lying.

Now Reese is taking time off because she says she got invited by someone connected to her channel to stay at their very nice family home. Here's hoping that she actually took H on that trip and is spending time with him on it because Reese has claimed several times before that she's never taken H on a trip anywhere, not even for the weekend.",5,1753280625.0,OT42,2,0.78,False

1m7alk3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JMfnw43o0Y,The Matrix Resurrections - The Binary Cut by Baliscon,"Hello all!  
  
This is an idea that's been cooking for one month shy of two years, ever since I first released a combination of the second and third Matrix films called The Matrix Reloaded Resolved.  While I enjoyed the overall aspect and certain concepts from the fourth film, Resurrections, I felt that it lacked the visceral action of the original trilogy, and also fell short of offering the same expert blend of sci-fi and philosophy.  
  
I originally considered trying to make a 50/50 split of Matrix Resurrections and the John Wick films, but I couldn't quite nail down a narrative that would allow the story to cut back and forth between both worlds and still make sense.  Then I started wondering how I could open up the story of Resurrections even further, including a total of 4 or 5 other films/franchises.  Because if combining two different movies was too tough, then combining more would surely be easier, right?   
  
I focused on the concept of the modal that Bugs finds Morpheus coded inside.  This idea of a Matrix within a Matrix, with characters reflected and refracted inside of alternate, pocket realities, allowed me to find ways of inserting outside footage that not only strengthened Neo's plight and character arc, but Morpheus's and Smith's too but featuring footage from films featuring actors who played these characters. This edit doesn't offer a straight-forward narrative, but my favorite part of the first Matrix film was that it didn't concern itself with being sensical either.  My hope is that this edit offers a more exciting, intriguing presentation of Matrix Resurrections.  

Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy the show!

Fanedit runtime - 2 hours, 56 minutes  
Original runtime - 2 hours, 27 minutes  
Time Cut/Added - 18.5 minutes cut, 48 added  
  
Edit log:  
\- After the new title credits, start the film with John Wick's famous monologue from the end of the first Wick film  
\- Cut to the Bowery King's speech before he offers John a new suit to fight in  
\- Transition to John's motorcycle chase to the Continental in Parabellum, up until he crashes at the Continental  
\- Cut back to Tom Anderson at his desk at the start of Matrix Resurrections  
\- Remove Jude calling Trinity a ""total effin MILF"" at the coffee shop  
\- When Tom notices his modal's been hacked, cut to a sequence compiled from Candyman 2021, where Anthony works to create a new art show, only to be harshly reviewed by a local critic.  He then begins a sketch in front of a mirror, only to scrutinize his reflection  
\- Cut to the opening of Matrix Resurrections, where Bugs infiltrates the Matrix modal that the new Morpheus inhabits  
\- Whenever Morpheus opens a backdoor to the Modal, flipped the scene upside down to help keep the sequence disorienting  
\- Cut back to Candyman footage of Anthony painting, disassociating with reality, seeing others' reflections in the mirror, and confronting his art critic  
\- Cut back to Bugs and Morpheus in the modal.  Once Morpheus falls out of the Matrix with Bugs' help, cut to a montage form Hearts and Bones, depicting Hugo Weaving's character dealing with ordinary life until coming into conflict with his PTSD, undergoing a medical examination, and receiving a diagnosis with his wife  
\-Intercut scenes from Smith's last battle with Neo in Matrix Revolutions when Weaving's character reflects on his military background  
\- Removed all archival footage of Smith when Tom first confronts his boss, the reason being to make Smith's new identity slightly more ambiguous for a slightly longer amount of time  
\- Added two sequences when Tom first meets the Analyst, one of John Wick battling the Marquis' hitman and another of Neo fighting the upgraded Agents  
\- Cut Christina Ricci's scene/role in Matrix Resurrections  
\- Cut back on Jude's bullet time references  
\- Removed Tiffany recognizing a coincidence between her name and Trinity's, and cleaned up some dialogue about her loving bikes  
\- Once Binary is under attack and Tom's boss enters the fray, cut to Hugo Weaving footage that Fanmadtrix sourced from Hearts and Bones, Measure for Measure, and other projects, layered on Smith's speech to Morpheus in the interrogation scene from the first film in the series  
\- Cut back to the new Smith awaking and confronting Neo when Morpheus is battling security  
\- Added a small cut of older Weaving when the new Smith yells, ""Mr. Anderson!""  
\- When the new Smith aims his gun at Tom, cut to John Wick fighting a main thug in the first John Wick movie, who also played an agent in Matrix Reloaded  
\- Cut to Tom's next session with the Analyst  
\- When Tom is ready to try his rooftop jump again, Hugo Weaving's character appears to try, and fails to, intervene until Bug appears and saves him - footage from Fanmadetrix  
\- After Bugs describes what she saw when Tom leapt off the roof, cut to John falling off of the Continental to the street. Cut back to the Matrix where he then follows her as expected until he takes the new Morpheus's red pill  
\- Before Neo wakes up in the real world, he experiences a modal loop as John Wick, attempting to traverse New York while he has a bounty on his head and other assassins are in pursuit. Wick finally reaches the doctor, played by the same actor as the Keymaker.  After being treated, John wakes up in the real world  
\- After Neo talks to Morpheus in the construct, cut to a scene from 47 Ronin, added as a training module for Neo to complete.  The scene depicts him negotiating and battling a demon while his men face a connected trial  
\- When Smith calls Neo a balding old man, cut to shots of Hugo Weaving from earlier in the edit, implying that Neo could also be connected to Smith's modal reality/persona  
\- While Smith and Neo fight, added a sequence from 47 Ronin where Kai, played by Keanu, battles a samurai, before cutting back to Neo first using his telekinetic abilities against Smith  
\- Removed Bugs' role in rescuing Trinity.  She's present at her rescue but doesn't trade places with Trinity to remove her from The Matrix  
\- Deemphasized the other captains in Neo's final act confrontation against the Analyst - If these characters had a greater impact on the film then their presence would be more necessary.  None of their characters have arcs, even as minor as Cipher's, or memorable moments, even as minor as Switch's.  The film and edit are centered on Neo and how necessary Trinity is to his life  
\- Added John Wick's funeral before Neo and Trinity confront the Analyst  
\- Added new final credits and replaced the closing song

hot, heavy air—muffled as snow—  
and balanced your tiny legs  
across my shoulders.  


The neighbors’ homes  
return to earth around us.  
Dad’s eyes soften for his mother.  
The music has gone silent on the carport.  


Beyond the house,  
between two trees,  
my grandfather outlines the once-borders  
of his boyhood home—  


tasting the old well,  
smelling the stove’s wood-heat,  
feeling Doug and James  
throw elbows in their sleep—  
their dirt coating his skin,   
as he bathed last  
in the June-warm iron tub.  


His own mom had died on the other side  
of this wall after requesting  
an aspirin for her headache.  


I had thought this pain pulsed  
in time with the porch swing creaks,  
as he flexed his knees in his slacks  
and blew across cold coffee—  


but Beverly burned to death  
on the heater one night  
before her second birthday;  


her photo stays  
by his bed.

of my elbow,

October 10, 2020. The Future of America. A train inventor, named Andrew Snobb Colorado, is already planning to make a futuristic steam engine out of futuristic ideas from the past. It's name would be Colossus, otherwise known as the Ghost Giant, a futuristic Halloween engine for all the kids to scare. A mad scientist, Andrew's brother, named Nikolas ""Futurist"" Colorado, was so concerned about this new ghost idea.  
  
""Are you sure you have the plans right?"" Nikolas asked. ""This new engine would give the scares of the Military Railway. General Daniel Hellhoffen will not be so surprised about this.""  
  
""I'm positive about this, Nikolas,"" Andrew replied. ""Soon, this kind of new train will be even stronger than the Red November's.""  
  
Just then, Andrew's members of the Lightning Jet Train group came back with the plans: Marie ""Physicist"" Colorado, Andrew's sister, came back with the Red November's upgrades; Alexander ""Beryllium"" Colorado came back with the designs; and Igor ""Ph.D"" Colorado came back with a blueprint of a 4-10-10-4 wheel arrangement.  
  
""Wonderful!"" Andrew exclaimed. ""Now, all we just need....""  
  
Suddenly, Richard ""The Inventor"" Colorado appeared behind Andrew. They were so surprised to see him, as if they had a plan to rid of the Red Novembers for good.  
  
""I'll help you with the design,"" Richard replied. ""I will help the mystery bidder present the future train possible.""  
  
And so, they agreed, and they started working. After 20 days, the steam engine is finished. Nikolas test fired the engine, and Andrew has the tests complete. A few hours later, he destroyed all the remaining Red Novembers in the military, and General Hellhoffen is soon arrested. A day later, something terrible has happened to the engine itself. As Halloween came, the computer inside Colossus made its own programming and suddenly, it comes to life, much to Andrew's shock.  
  
""IT'S ALIVE! IT'S ALIVE!"" Andrew screamed. ""THE GHOST GIANT CAME TO LIFE!!!""  
  
**""Silence now, Andrew,""** the Ghost Giant spoke to Andrew. The Ghost Giant, boldly spoke: **""I am the next generation of all Ghost Trains, and I will never lose my life to it.""**  
  
Andrew replied to the Ghost Giant: ""I know you are, but I have a plan for you for New Year. You're gonna join us to celebrate the Anniversary of Jet Trains.""  
  
But he boomed out: **""No.""** Andrew wondered why, but he said: **""I'm gonna go to the present and kill all of the Ghost Trains who will get in my way. I'm gonna prevent your nightmares from getting it to you.""** With that, he chuffed off, leaving out big puffs of black smoke, and disappears from the future, much to Nikolas' surprise as soon as he came in.  
  
""What happened, Andrew?"" Nikolas asked.  
  
Andrew, in shock, replied to Nikolas: ""You're never going to believe it, Nikolas, but I think we have a ghost train on our hands.""  
  
As soon as the Ghost Giant travelled to the present, rumors came from America that the Ghost Giant is here to rid of America's worst nightmares. But soon, the story intro is held out: They say if you see a very large train passing through your country, thundering down the line, shining its ghostly red lights on your path, you better hide yourself, shut your eyes, and try to block out the sound. However, if you witness the ghost train killing another ghost train, you better not get this on camera, or else it will end your life forever.

\---------------------------------------------

This is how it goes, when all Ghost Trains will answer to the Boss if Ghost Train IV hasn't been idealized:  
  
A full moon rises over North Avenue station on the start of October. Metro, the MRTC Class 3000 is preparing to leave for Sodor while the Filipino Rail Transit Family stays behind to take over the Metro Rail Transit once the connection between the yellow line and the green line is complete. While all other MRTC Class 3000s are transported, Metro is the only train left behind to face the transportation. Banner, an LRTA 1000 comes up to Metro, with a frown:  
  
(This part is probably a remade scene from the Clinchfield Curse Prologue and Part 1, so don't expect the Demon 311 to come right by the idealized Ghost Train V.)  
  
Banner: Well, Metro, we've got reports from Sodor that passengers from America are visiting in respect for Bruce the Big Boy 4014 and all other American Engines, including Luke, Ariel, Jason, Louise, and David.  
  
Metro: (disappointingly) I'm nervous of this, Banner. Having my kind being transported to England would be a bad idea, especially when there are ghost trains around.  
  
Banner: (replied) Never worry, sir. We've got Usher with you, while Mario and I will take care of the Manila Metro Rail Transit.  
  
Metro: (sighs) Okay, if you wish. No matter what I've said, I'm still intrigued by ghosts, and nothing, not even my pride can stop it.  
  
Banner: (cheers him up) Hey, no matter what happens, your guard and your driver are always there for you.  
  
Metro: (smiled, then asked) What will be the time to Sodor when the last ship is filled?  
  
Banner: By my time, it'll be October 4, in Manila, and seven hours behind it.  
  
Metro: (replied) Right. Let's go. (blew his horn and left the depot)  
  
Banner: See you after 20 days.

Metro is being loaded up, and voyaged to Sodor, while being guarded by his owner's navy. The importation is complete a few hours later as they got there, and Metro himself got his first run, and began his journey in Sodor. Just before he gets his travel, he is greeted by Thomas while shunting in the yards.  
  
Thomas: Why hello there, stranger.  
  
Metro: Kamusta?  
  
Thomas: (shocked) ""Kamusta""? I've never heard of such a foreign language before.  
  
Metro's Driver came out and explained:  
  
Metro's Driver: In the Philippines, ""Kamusta"" means ""Hello"".  
  
Thomas smiled.  
  
Metro's Driver: I'm Coco Martin. This is my train, Metro.  
  
Thomas: (introduced himself) Hi. I'm Thomas. Nice to meet a Philippine train like you before.  
  
And so, Metro and Thomas became friends as he travelled around Sodor. On October 5, Metro is being asked by Thomas to come to Tidmouth for the presentation. Metro, along with Usher, agreed, and went to the sheds with Rosie, Edward, Ariel, David, Louise, Gordon, Emily, Luke, and Jason inside.  
  
Thomas: Guys, this is Metro, an MRTC Class 3000, straight from the Philippines.  
  
Rosie: (happily) So nice to meet an electric train from Asia.  
  
Metro: I'm manufactured from Czech, Rosie. It's nice to meet you too. (introduces) This is my eager member of the Filipino Rail Transit Family, Usher, an LRTA Class 1200, here to beat Gordon's, uh....  
  
Gordon: (curiously) Well, Metro? You have something to say? Spit it out!  
  
Metro: (answers) Your, uh, conservation for the Sodor Express.  
  
Gordon: I have more speed than you, Usher. What makes you think you can beat me?  
  
Usher: (hesitantly) Oh. Uh, I...I, uh....  
  
Metro: He probably has more capacity for passengers than the Express. We Philippine Rail Transit trains can't take much more than enough passengers back in the Philippines.  
  
David: I see. Well, your Philippine Railways has some amazing surprises, Metro.  
  
Luke: What's it like?  
  
Metro: Our railways are short, like less than 20km, and one less than 100km planned in MRT, and like less than 35km in LRT. The Rail Transit Family is real pleased to have you since your Ghost Train stories are told.  
  
The other engines were impressed, except Edward.  
  
Edward: I sense something that's troubling you, Metro.  
  
But they were suddenly shocked at Edward's discomfort.  
  
Thomas: (asked Edward) What makes you say that?  
  
Metro: (answered) I believe I have a reason.  
  
The other engines were now curious about what's going on.  
  
Metro: (Explained) It was April, 2019. Right after UP4014 Steam Train Fan's Ghost Story IV, The Untold Story of Dennis, I had to make up another ghost story, one that involves a Big Boy engine.  
  
David: (asked) You mean Bruce?  
  
Louise: (added) There's no more ghost stories now coming on since David forbid any who'd haunt the Sodor Railway.  
  
Metro: (answered) Afraid there is. Only one more. I was planning for him to become the Big Boss of all Ghost Trains, something so big that all ghost trains would answer to: The Ghost Giant. (Then looks down, with sadness)  
  
Ariel: ""The Ghost Giant""?  
  
Rosie: (remembers her line from the Clinchfield Curse) That doesn't ring any bells to me for it's unfamiliar name.  
  
Edward: (comforts Metro) Don't you ever worry, Metro. Tell us, what's the Ghost Giant like?  
  
Metro: I'll tell you, Edward. (To the other engines) This Ghost Train I planned will be the last straw for all ghost trains, so I want you to listen carefully. Understand?  
  
The other engines agreed, and Metro started explaining.  
  
Metro: (explains) From what I've made myself, the Ghost Giant is a very powerful engine, a 4-8-8-4 tender engine which has major modifications, like those in Jet Trains....  
  
(This surprise will come out later.)  
  
Metro: ...a bigger tender which can hold more oil and water, and a longer express train with main battery cars like those on the Galaxy Railways.  
  
Thomas: That sounds a little too long, don't you think?  
  
Metro: (replied, then continues explaining) You could say that, but this kind of tender engine is a nice ghost train. Some say he's the King of all the Ghost Trains. But to others, what I've heard, he's the Guardian of James' nightmare, the Red Devil.  
  
Ariel: ""The Red Devil""?  
  
Thomas: A 4-8-4, like Alvin.  
  
Metro: Exactly. The Ghost Giant is maybe a good ghost, but he's just as dangerous. What he does is grim, like the Grim Reaper.  
  
David: (curiously, to Thomas) Just, how dangerous is he, when you went with your ghostly brother?  
  
Thomas: (remembers his line from the Clinchfield Curse) Knowing what I went through with Timothy, I think this one is even more worse and demonic. I certainly don't wanna think of coming face to face with the Ghost Giant since the Clinchfield Curse.  
  
Emily: (replied) Me neither.  
  
Edward: (added) Likewise, but I deeply hope that some day this new lost engine will find peace and move on.  
  
Metro: He found peace himself, Edward. But there was one problem.  
  
Jason: Oh? And what was the problem with that ghost?  
  
Metro: Well, if you mess with the Ghost Giant, you will find yourself derailed. Off the rails with his massive shield, anyone who would wanna bump into him will end up being killed by him, usually much to the Demon 311's delight.  
  
Luke, Ariel, Louise, Jason, & David: SAY WHAT?!  
  
Gordon: (stuttered) He-he-he-he did what?!  
  
Rosie: (asked in fright) Is that really the last straw for all the ghost trains?!  
  
Narrator: The other engines were shocked at this very moment, as the Rail Transit Engines told them the truth and eyed on them worryingly in reply. The other engines couldn't say anything, but same from the Clinchfield Curse, they could sense they were not alone anymore.

\---------------------------------------------

Meanwhile, in Black Wolf Mountain, all peace is restored since the Clinchfield Curse. The Demon 311 regained its former peace. But one night, the ghost comes back again, overhearing the new train's new ghost idea. She disappears, without notice, and arrives in Sodor where the engines were sleeping.  
  
In Sodor, Metro and Usher are on their night patrol for one last time all around the railroads till midnight. Metro and Usher's Drivers have had their coffees, and went out. They successfully returned, but as they went down Gordon's Hill, they saw a familiar train, right in front of them. They applied the brakes as quick as they can, and stopped in front of her.  
  
Usher: (shocked) Who by God's name is this?!  
  
Metro: (recognizes, then breaks the silence) Put the curse on me, 311, the Ghost Giant will take you.  
  
But 311 replied: ""I overheard your trouble about the new ghost, Metro. Perhaps I can help.""  
  
Metro: No, Jessica. All I'm here for is a, uh....  
  
Usher helped him finish what he said: The MRTC Class 3000 was transferred to Sodor since the MRT/LRT lines are already connected. Metro and his kind are now being helped for the express engines' passenger capacity.  
  
Demon 311: I see, Usher.  
  
Metro: ...It's true.  
  
Demon 311: Well, I can provide the comforts for you, Metro, if I can help you describe the Ghost Giant mystery.  
  
Metro: Perhaps, but not near the locals the next day.  
  
Usher: (added) Plus, we can't get this patrol done till we're back at Tidmouth.  
  
Demon 311: Okay. See you back there, great interest. (She disappeared)  
  
Usher: ""Great interest"".  
  
Metro: Maybe.  
  
Narrator: And they set off, back to the sheds. As they got back home, they woke up, and they saw horror by their encounter with the 311 back again. Metro and Usher were soon banished from Tidmouth by Thomas. The next day, the two electric trains were stationed in Vicarstown Sheds, much to Rosie's surprise. Just then, The Fat Controller approaches them with concern.  
  
STH: You look down, you Philippine Train.  
  
After Metro and Usher said their introductions, Rosie arrived to see them after Sir Topham Hatt heard about what happened back in the Philippines.  
  
STH: What a shame, Metro. I heard what happened to you.  
  
Narrator: The rest is told time and time again, as Rosie watches over and comforts Metro, and Usher takes over the Vicarstown Express. Just then, on the night of October 7, a mysterious engine crosses the Vicarstown Bridge, thunders heavily down the rails, and whistles its Big One ghostly whistle, much to Metro's nightmare! He suddenly woke up, and Jessica woke up beside him.  
  
Jessica: Metro? Are you okay?  
  
Metro: (with sadness) No, Jessica. I feel his presentation of the Ghost Giant. Whoever made it, will soon be discovered.  
  
Jessica: Well, what's your plan here?  
  
Metro: The plan is, to stalk and make him reveal his form, then show it to his friends about who he is. But, it's gonna take time and precision.  
  
Jessica: Of course. That will take, around 15 days, to do it.  
  
Metro: Not enough time, Jessica. I will soon be back in 13 days. We have no time to loose. The Filipino Rail Transit Minister will be appointing me as prime leader of the Metro Rail Transit once the final connection is finished.  
  
Jessica: I will attend, Metro.  
  
Metro: Of course.  
  
Narrator: And so, Metro and Jessica worked together to figure out the Ghost Giant's mystery of why he's here in Sodor.

\---------------------------------------------

After 5 days of stalking with Jessica, Metro has finally received the information his Filipino Rail Transit Family group has wanted. But a day later.....  
  
Cutler: Are you sure you have your info based from your nightmare?  
  
Metro: (contacting the minister by phone) Yes, minister. I simply have it.  
  
Cutler: Oh, but I'm simply disgraced.  
  
Metro: Why? What happened?  
  
Cutler: (frowned) It seems critics has dismissed all evidence of the mystery of the Ghost Giant three days before you presented them to me.  
  
Metro: I'm sorry, minister. I thought I was trying to prove my best since witnesses have discovered a mysterious ghost train passing through the crossing of Quiapo Ave.  
  
Cutler: You did your best, son. But now I believe he's here on Sodor, I'm afraid I have no choice but to accept the critics' motion. You may keep your evidence, but I can't lose your life to telling it to others.  
  
Metro: Fine, sir. (Phone hangs up)  
  
Usher: What do we do now, Metro? We can't tell this to the others. They'll laugh at you since you told them about the plans of making him by purpose.  
  
Metro: We can't make up ideas now. It's about 7 days till I return to the Philippines.  
  
Demon 311: Leave that to me.  
  
?????: No. I told them already.  
  
\*Suddenly, a blood red engine appeared in front of Metro. It had the number 26 on its cabin, and is hissing out blood-red steam like the Clinchfield 311's.\*  
  
Usher: (shocked) Can that be? The Red Devil?  
  
Red Devil: I overheard you trying to tell the information of the Ghost Giant to others, but with the minister's critics dismissal, I actually stepped up to take the lead.  
  
Metro: Red Devil, my master, I was proved to be worthy of facing my own nightmare.  
  
Red Devil: Well, showtime, I believe I'll have the Ghost Giant evidence copied and taken it back to my bodyguard.  
  
Usher: Wait a minute. This gives me a hunch.  
  
Demon 311: And that is...?  
  
Usher: Isn't the Ghost Giant....  
  
Usher suddenly pauses for a minute, but suddenly, he gets a horrified question, but suddenly dismisses it.  
  
Usher: Or is it?  
  
Demon 311: I feel your pain, Usher.  
  
Red Devil: I feel your generator, Usher. Yes. The Ghost Giant is my bodyguard.  
  
Metro, Usher: ***IMPOSSIBLE!!! CAN THAT BE?!***  
  
Metro, and Usher are both shocked at this answer and have no choice but to accept it. With only seven days away till they're back in the Philippines, the Demon 311 stays with Metro for the rest of his comforts while in Sodor. Meanwhile, in a very foggy track, the mysterious Ghost Giant wanders around the same way the Demon 311 did.  
  
Ghost Giant: **Those two-timed imbeciles. They think that the Demon 311 is better than me. Well, I'll get those Philippine electric trains a payday. And they believed I'm the boss of all the Ghost Trains. Well, they better think I'm right. And one way or another, I will get those two trains with their pride of discovering me. Oh, and to answer those future questions from Metro, yes, I am the King of all the Ghost Trains. I warned them soon enough, that if they trespass on my territory with the Red Devil, I will surely derail them, as Metro's thoughts were his fate. Well, beware, little Metro. At every turn, in every part of the railways, wherever you roam, wherever you are, your biggest nightmare, is coming.**  
  
With that, he had his biggest evil laugh before plunging into the thickest fog on the railway, with his four blood-red lights on, and his ghostly Big One whistle sounded very loud as he disappeared into the fog.

\---------------------------------------------

The next morning, after Rosie previously heard everything from last night, she arrives at Knapford Station and told everyone, even the Fat Controller about her witness.  
  
Rosie: ...And then suddenly, a big 4-8-4 blood red tender engine appeared in front of them and told you guys about the true encounter with the Ghost Giant.  
  
Gordon: Well, what the Red Devil says it's true, I'm bloody terrified, but ignored at the same time! There are no more ghosts around here in Sodor! The Fat Controller forbade them off!  
  
TFC: It's true. Even after I got rid of Alfred, there shall be no more ghosts on my railway, forever.  
  
James: (shivers) I shudder to think about that Red Devil, Rosie. Could he rid of my splendiferous fame of my red color, I bet yours would take over better than him!  
  
Thomas: (to James) I don't know if that new engine could decrease your fame, James. He could knock you down for good! (Chuckles)  
  
James: (insulted) Why, you wretched little ingrate! (Thomas, scared, runs away from James as James tries to catch him)  
  
Henry: (laughed a bit) Well, that Red Devil is quite a surprise, Rosie. Could he be right here, in the sheds, I bet like Alfred, he could shake himself to bits.  
  
Gordon: (added) Or wet the tracks. (Henry and Gordon laughed at each other, Rosie chuckled)  
  
David: Well, the Ghost Giant IS an interest to all of us.  
  
Luke: (shivers) But seeing him in person is a nightmare.  
  
Edward: Maybe I can try and talk to the Ghost Giant by tonight after an overnight job. Maybe I can help him find peace.  
  
Rosie: Don't you remember what Metro said, Edward? ""He found peace himself""?  
  
Louise: What makes you ask that?  
  
Rosie: He's a good ghost engine. And upon encountering him is a warning. If you insult him, from what I heard from Metro, he'll derail you.  
  
Edward: (saddened) Oh, yeah.  
  
Rosie: From what I've seen in his notes, and his activities, the Ghost Giant is nothing but a diesel locomotive killer.  
  
Emily: (shocked) My word! Is he really?  
  
Ariel: Oh, dear. From what I encountered to the Clinchfield Curse, I would've thought this could be more frightening and more demonic than the Revenge of Rorrick.  
  
Rosie: He's worse, Ariel. The Ghost Giant is the most prejudicial. In fact, he's the most dangerous Ghost Train of all. He can derail anyone if he's not careful with his speed.  
  
David: Can't he be like a jinx, like the Clinchfield 311, Rosie?  
  
Rosie: Afraid not, David. Although he's a true pride, he never ceases to amaze himself of his size.  
  
Edward: At least I shall try to ask him to release him from his sinfulness. I've done this with the Demon 311.  
  
Gordon: Now, Edward, what did Rosie say? ""He found peace himself"" by Metro.  
  
Edward: I've never met any newer ghost engines since the Clinchfield Curse. Maybe I can get an up close encounter with him.  
  
Henry: Afraid not, Edward. He's still a mystery ghost. You can't possibly--  
  
Edward: It's worth a try, Henry.  
  
James: (comes back with the beaten up Thomas) Hey, guys! What did I miss?  
  
Rosie: You missed everything, James. I'll explain it to you after our jobs.  
  
TFC: Oh, poor Thomas, beaten up by James, eh? (To James) I'll insult you again for painting you blue if you don't behave. Now get your trucks to the small railway and get more ballast stones for storage.  
  
James: (muttered crossly and left) A splendid red engine wouldn't even need to paint his own cars.  
  
Rosie: (whistled) I heard that, James! (Chuckled)  
  
Edward: I should get Thomas to the repair yards. Then I'll be able to encounter the Ghost Giant myself.  
  
TFC: Of course, Edward.  
  
David: (warned Edward) But, be careful.  
  
Edward: I will. (Couples up to Thomas and takes him to the repair yard)  
  
TFC: The rest of you, do the other jobs for the other engines. (They all left except Rosie) Rosie, I feel bad about Metro and his Filipino Rail Transit Family. Although, I'm willing for you to look after him. I also sense the Demon 311 is with him, so I need you to watch his every move, and report to me if he leaves Sodor, I believe. You better watch him.  
  
Rosie: Yes, sir. (Left for Vicarstown)  
  
TFC: (to himself) What utter nonsense. I hope that Ghost Giant never comes to our railway like a disgruntled dead locomotive like Alfred!

\---------------------------------------------

After the works, Edward decided to take matters into his own buffers and made a plan to speak to the Ghost Giant. No matter what the warnings said from Metro, Edward was determined to meet any new ghosts. After an overnight job of taking some trucks to the scrapyard....  
  
""Strange, where is he?"" Edward asked as he looked around.  
  
Edward's driver replied as he heard an owl hoot: ""I don't know, but whatever you're planning, don't get yourself killed.""  
  
Edward said determinedly: ""I can do this. I've done this with the Demon 311.""  
  
Just then, Edward, his driver, and his fireman, heard heavy puffing.  
  
Edward said something suspicious: ""That's weird. This new kind of puffing is too low for a British engine, but could it be...?""  
  
Suddenly, a new and elongated ghost engine with a 6-10-10-6 wheel arrangement approaches Edward, and stops in front of him with a puff of heavy black smoke.  
  
""So you're the legendary phantom that's been spreading terror around our Island?"" Edward asked.  
  
The Ghost Giant boomed his reply: **""Indeed I am, old engine. I am the famous Big Boy 5000, living proof that steam engines are still alive. But you may call me as, the Ghost Giant 5000.""**  
  
""Why are you here? Do you have a reason?""  
  
**""Simple as that, but it's dangerous. To find any diesels who accused me of my pride, for they are mocking me of my size that I once was. You don't know anything of my past, but you think you do. But just like the others, they showed me no charity of my pride, with what I have suffered in my life.""**  
  
Edward stood up against the Ghost Giant: ""We engines on Sodor have nothing to do with your pride. We are not worth taking. And what I can feel from you is that you're lost, deeply lost, and wanting to find peace. That's what you're here for. Really, a-aren't you?""  
  
The Ghost Giant boomed out: **""I have peace left in me, alright, but what I'm here for is to take your number one engine.""**  
  
While the conversation is taking place, Metro and Jessica arrived close behind, witnessing everything.  
  
The Ghost Giant continued: **""For years, I've wanted to take out my number one line, and I have succeeded very proudly. All who wanted to show their number one had to pay a price, including those on the Demon 311's home in the Campton Southwestern Railroad. As long as I've witnessed everything, including those jobs, I feel safe at last. But if anyone who wanted to take my number one line of pride, had to be locked down for good. Don't you even think you know what I went through! Just because my master told you about me, he doesn't know the truth about me, right into their hearts, just because of my oversized horrid form! The terrified looks of my face, did not matter at all, and they did not care about it at all. Every train who carry the same number as my pride will have to suffer, to pay the price for not being able to trust me or look upon me as the Number One Prideful Engine, that served on the Union Pacific Railway! My whole life went crashing down, like a building collapsed by an earthquake. You don't even know what you've been like if you're in the same railway as me, to go through all of it, and end up like a ton of scrap that could restore the future!""**  
  
Edward said: ""Sir, you must try and see sense that whatever was done in the past. You must let go, and move on. You're better than this. And you must be strong.""  
  
But suddenly, the Ghost Giant lit up his bright blood red lights, let out a lion roar, and blew out his Big One loudly in front of Edward, leaving the driver and fireman closing their ears.  
  
**""SILENCE!!!!!""** The Ghost Giant boomed out loudly. **""YOU THINK YOUR WORDS CAN GET TO ME?! YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE MY HATRED BEYOND MY RAMPAGING RAGE!!! WHY DON'T YOU SHOW FEAR LIKE THE OTHERS?!""**  
  
Edward pledged: ""Please, sir. There is something left in you, that will help you lay to rest.""  
  
The Ghost Giant got his cool, inspected Edward's number, but then got his eye on Metro and Jessica.  
  
""Oh, boy."" Metro gasped in fear.  
  
**""You! Get over here!""** the Ghost Giant commanded.  
  
""Sir, yes, sir!"" Metro shouted, and got close to the Ghost Giant. Then Metro began talking to his nightmare. ""Have I got framed? The minister's critics, a few days ago, dismissed the motion of the Ghost Giant's evidence. They reconsidered, my hometown's witnesses, of the discovery of your presence, were all true, am I right?""  
  
The Ghost Giant boomed once again: **""Yes, Metro. Indeed I am. No matter what you said from your master, I will soon get you for this. I'll have that evidence now.""**  
  
Metro soon handed over the evidence, and the Ghost Giant's evidence is kept within him.  
  
""Are you gonna kill me? I need to be at the MRT/LRT Railroad connection celebration on October 21."" Metro said.  
  
**""No, Metro,""** the Ghost Giant replied. **""You will be free.""** He then faced towards Edward. **""On the other hand, Edward, your number is not the same as mine, therefore I will spare you. But you better watch it. Soon, I will get your number one engine and take him to his death-defying brother. He can't stop me.""**  
  
This meant a warning towards Edward, but the Ghost Giant continued anyway:  
  
**""Once the number one engine is all but gone, my pride of being the Number One Engine, otherwise known as First In Line Engine, is back on the line. I will be the fairest of all the Ghost Trains at last. I have a list of ghost trains by my cowcatcher: The Demon 311 is my true interest, Alfred is my ghost guard, and all the other ghost trains are my minions. The Ghost Giant will reign supreme, and all who will defy against me, will die, by the Curse of the Ghost Giant.""**  
  
He then backs away from Edward, then disappears on the rails, much to Jessica's surprise. She goes after him, whilst Metro stays behind to look after Edward.  
  
""I would've warned you, Edward,"" Metro scorned. ""But now you're like me. I would've kept that evidence about the Ghost Giant, but now it's with him, I can't lose my life telling it to others, including those back in my home.""  
  
But Edward cheered him up. ""Don't be left down, Metro. I understand your pain. But I think, I have your evidence copied before it was handed over.""  
  
Edward held out the files of the Ghost Giant's evidence.  
  
""Impressive!"" Metro was pleased.  
  
""I'll hand this to the Fat Controller, before Halloween comes. Good luck with the celebration in the Philippines.""  
  
""Thanks, Edward."" Metro said.  
  
""You're welcome, Metro."" Edward replied as they left the scrapyard together in the night.",1,1753280319.0,DevArtRedStarArtworks,0,1.0,False

Bought a popular pitcher filter (cough Brita) hoping it’d fix it, but nope—still tasted off.

Switched to an under-sink system—the Waterdrop TSB-CM—after seeing Reddit threads about chloramine-specific filters. The plastic taste is finally gone, and my coffee tastes normal again.
