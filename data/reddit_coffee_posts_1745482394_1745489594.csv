Hey freelancers, solo grinders, and small agency legends —

Ever stared at your timesheet like it's written in Elvish, wondering what you even *did* this week?

Same.

So I built this:

👉 [**Mortimer.pro**](http://Mortimer.pro)

**TL;DR —** A fast, no-fluff time tracker that’s built for sending better invoices, not impressing your project manager.

# 🧪 What is it?

Mortimer is a lightweight time tracker for freelancers and small agencies that focuses on what *actually* matters:  
**Getting paid for your time.**

No complex dashboards.  
No project manager features you'll never use.  
Just clear, invoice-ready time tracking that makes sense.

You fill in what you did, we help you make sure it’ll make sense to your client (and accountant), and boom — invoice-worthy data without the drama.

# 🧠 Why am I building this?

Because I got tired of using tools that feel like they were built *for* PMs and *against* humans.

Mortimer is built for people like me — and maybe you — who:

* Don’t track time for fun
* Just want to get through the week without crying into a spreadsheet
* Want invoices that are accurate, clear, and fast to produce

# 🚧 Where’s it at?

🟢 **Live and working**  
🛠️ Still early — some duct tape, some elbow grease  
👀 Looking for **alpha and beta users** to test it, break it, and help shape it

If you’ve ever wanted a say in how your tools actually work — this is it.

# 💡 Who’s it for?

* Freelancers who send invoices every month but hate tracking time
* Agencies with small teams and big energy
* Entrepreneurs who need just enough structure to bill, but not so much they need onboarding videos
* Anyone who’s ever typed “best time tracker for invoicing” into Google and closed the tab 4 minutes later

# 🎁 What do you get?

* Early access to Mortimer
* A direct line to me (founder/dev/chief coffee consumer)
* Influence over what gets built next
* A sweet deal when we launch (yes, including “free forever” options if you help us grow)

If you’re down to help shape a time tracker that *doesn’t suck*, I’d love to have you.

My biggest problem with HX machines is the temperature stability and the overcomplicated builds, so I don't want one.  
Same with the E61, I can do the maintenance but I don't have the time or patience anymore, so no E61.  
  
I am left with dual boiler machines or single boiler machines. I rarely drink cappuccinos, so a dual boiler might be overkill, but I would not mind having the option to improve my poor frothing skills.  
I only drink medium/dark roast Italian 9 bar espresso, I rarely experiment with single origins or light roasts, and I value body and texture in my coffee.  
  
The main options I have come up with are the Rancilio Silvia Pro X and the Profitec Move. Other options include the Ascaso Steel Duo PID, Lelit Elizabeth, Profitec Pro 300, but I don't see any of them as better than the Silvia or the Move.  
It seems that the Move has better programmability and is a bit more flexible than the Silvia, but not much first hand information is available yet, while the Silvia is known as a reliable machine. I can get the Silvia for 1400€, while the Move is on backorder at 1950€.  
  
I am not sure if the price difference is reasonable in terms of features, build quality or something else.  
The Profitec Pro 300 costs €1500, the Lelit €1200. You can also suggest other options I may have overlooked, I would not mind spending more if it meant getting a much better espresso for my rather narrow use case.",1,1745489236.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

DP connectors in 3 monitor setup","When I booted up my system this morning everything was working fine. Workspace looked like it should, with all 3 monitors working perfectly fine. The system (Tumbleweed, GNome GUI) prompted I should run updates... I did, went to get a coffee and when I came back one of my monitors was just dead.

As the power LED on the monitor was still working (red, no signal, instead of white) I assumed it was either the cable or the DP connector on the GPU or the monitor was not on in the display settings. Checking the display settings: Monitor not showing up.

Next step: Shutting the system down. After a few seconds I did turn it on again. Stopping at the bootloader I was switching cables and ports on the GPU around. Every monitor was working fine when connected to DP1. No signal from the two other DP.

Now it's going to get funny: I still keep Windows on a second SSD. Instead of booting back into Linux I decided to boot Windows, just to find out, that all three connectors were working fine. All there displays showing a picture at the right settings.

As Windows was working fine: Reboot Linux and.... everything is working as intended again. My best guess: The Linux update did screw up the GPU firmware and the Windows driver fixed it. Any other ideas?",2,1745489199.0,linuxhardware,0,1.0,False

Dani, I know we’re no longer friends, and I appreciate that you’ve opened up to talk. Look, I can’t be just your friend — it’s impossible for me. I don’t want to see you walking down the aisle with another man. I don’t want to see another man bringing you breakfast in bed. I don’t want to watch another man make you tea and take care of you on those tough period days.

I want to be that man.
I want to be the one you play the violin for.
I want to be the man you wake up next to, even if it's with a snore or a little gas.
I want to be the guy you scold for leaving the towel where it doesn’t belong.
I want to be the one you ask how to make coffee.
I want to be the one you look for when you’re flying high or feeling low.
I want to be the one who massages your feet after long days teaching philosophy at the university.
I want to be the man who cooks something delicious for you.
The man who throws you a silly, cramped birthday party in our tiny apartment full of too many people.
The man who wipes your tears when you cry.
The one you ask where your underwear is because you can’t find it.
The one whose socks you steal because yours are missing.
The one who tells you your outfit looks phenomenal.
The one who feeds Beto.
The one who gets annoyed when you don’t do the dishes.
The one — like you once said — who helps you build that wall.

I want to be the man you show that long-awaited pregnancy test to after we’ve tried for so long.
The man who jumps with joy when you tell him the baby is a girl.
The man who kneels down to place a ring on your finger.
The man you see waiting at the altar as you walk in arm-in-arm with your dad.
The man who says, “I do.”
The man who scolds our daughter for not doing her homework, and who watches you comfort her, because that’s the kind of mother you’ll be.
The man who cries with you when she leaves for university, and again when we see her in a cap and gown.
The man who cries with you when we find out we’re going to be grandparents.
The man who plays your favorite songs in the afternoons, massages your feet before bed, and hands you your vitamins each morning.

But most of all…
I want you to be the woman whose eyes are the last thing I see before I close mine one final time.

Congratulations on your unprecedented twenty-five-year reign as cosmic hide-and-seek champion. Your stealth is the stuff of legends. However, the judges (that's me, and I'm tapping my foot impatiently) have rendered their verdict: time's up! Seriously, you have to stop! And trust me, finding me will be a walk in the park compared to the Houdini act you've been pulling.

Twenty-five years? You've had me playing this ridiculous game for a quarter of a century! I've navigated this planet, enduring countless awkward encounters with human-shaped wrong numbers, while you've remained more elusive than a decent parking spot downtown on a Saturday. Honestly? Your dedication to this disappearing act is almost admirable, if it weren't, you know, my life we're talking about here! 😾😤

So, here I am, sending this message into the vast expanse, hoping it somehow bypasses your undoubtedly sophisticated cloaking technology. Please, for the love of all that is good and slightly less infuriating, cease the games and just talk to me. My internal clock is ticking louder than a broken grandfather clock in a horror movie. Because, bro (and yes, addressing my potential life partner with the casual familiarity of a long-lost college buddy feels entirely appropriate at this point), we are SO running out of time.

I've had enough near misses to populate a whole rom-com montage. Were you the one I accidentally spilled coffee on last Tuesday? Sent me a dm but I accidentally ignored, Or perhaps you're the phantom who always snags the last bread at my favorite bakery? The universe clearly has a twisted sense of humor, and I wouldn't be surprised if we've had multiple awkward encounters, completely oblivious to the cosmic significance of the moment.

Therefore, to my exceptionally talented at disappearing soulmate: consider this my official, slightly desperate, and definitely impatient announcement. The game is over. It's time to reveal yourself and bring this quarter-century-long charade to an end. My patience is dwindling faster than free pizza at a student event, and frankly, I'm starting to think you owe me about twenty-five years' worth of witty banter, shared meals, and definitely a farm of ducks. Just saying.

And for the record, absolutely no sending flirty and unsolicited pictures! 🙅🏻‍♀️😾😾😾

1k6ocln,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_benefcoffee953/comments/1k6ocln/benefits_of_coffee/,Benefits of Coffee,"# The Benefits of Coffee: More Than Just a Morning Pick-Me-Up

For many, coffee is more than a beverage — it’s a ritual, a comfort, and a jumpstart to the day. But what if we told you that your favorite morning brew is also a powerhouse of wellness?

Whether you prefer it black, lightly sweetened, or with a splash of oat milk, **coffee offers an impressive list of health benefits** — from improved focus and fat burning to disease prevention and mental well-being.

Let’s dive into the **benefits of coffee**, and why that warm, aromatic cup is one of the simplest ways to support a healthy, energized, and fulfilling life.

# 1. A Natural Energy Booster

One of the most well-known benefits of coffee is its ability to **boost energy levels**. Thanks to its caffeine content, coffee stimulates the central nervous system, helping you feel more awake, focused, and alert.

Whether you’re gearing up for a morning meeting, a workout, or just trying to stay sharp throughout your day, coffee gives you:

* Improved concentration
* Better mood and motivation
* Faster reaction times

It’s not just about staying awake — it’s about feeling alive.

# 2. Supports Fat Burning and Physical Performance

Caffeine, the active ingredient in coffee, is found in nearly every fat-burning supplement — and for good reason.

Studies show caffeine can:

* Boost **metabolic rate** by 3–11%
* Enhance the breakdown of body fat
* Improve **physical performance** by up to 12%

Drinking coffee 30–60 minutes before a workout can help you push harder, last longer, and burn more fat — making it an ideal pre-workout drink for fitness lovers and weekend warriors alike.

# 3. Packed with Antioxidants

Coffee is rich in **antioxidants**, which help protect the body from oxidative stress — a process linked to aging and chronic disease.

In fact, for many people, coffee is the **biggest source of antioxidants** in their diet — even more than fruits and vegetables.

Antioxidants in coffee support:

* Immune function
* Cellular health
* Inflammation reduction
* Longevity and anti-aging benefits

If you’re looking for a reason to sip slowly and savor your coffee, this is it.

# 4. May Protect Against Cognitive Decline

Drinking coffee regularly has been linked to a lower risk of developing **Alzheimer’s disease**, **Parkinson’s disease**, and **cognitive decline**.

Caffeine helps:

* Stimulate brain activity
* Improve memory and alertness
* Protect brain cells from damage

It’s no wonder coffee is often called “brain fuel.” Over time, these benefits add up to stronger cognitive health — helping you stay sharp and engaged in every season of life.

# 5. Reduces Risk of Several Chronic Diseases

Several long-term studies have shown that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a **reduced risk** of major health conditions, including:

* **Type 2 diabetes**
* **Heart disease**
* **Stroke**
* **Certain cancers** (like liver and colorectal cancer)
* **Liver diseases** (like cirrhosis and fatty liver disease)

These protective effects are linked to coffee’s antioxidants, anti-inflammatory properties, and its role in regulating insulin and liver enzymes.

# 6. Elevates Mood and Mental Health

Need a little mood lift? Coffee can help.

Caffeine stimulates the release of dopamine and serotonin — the brain’s “feel-good” chemicals — which can:

* Improve mood
* Reduce stress and anxiety
* Enhance emotional well-being

One study even found that people who drink coffee regularly may have a **lower risk of depression**. It's a simple daily act that supports emotional resilience and mental clarity — no prescription needed.

# 7. Supports Social and Emotional Connection

Let’s not forget the **emotional benefits of coffee** — it brings people together. Whether you're catching up with a friend, going on a coffee date, or bonding with coworkers over a break, coffee creates space for **connection and conversation**.

Sometimes, the healthiest moments of our day aren’t what we drink — it’s who we share it with.

# 8. May Support Longevity

Here’s the big one: research suggests that **coffee drinkers may live longer**.

A large-scale study published in *The New England Journal of Medicine* found that individuals who drank coffee daily had a **lower risk of death** from all causes — especially those related to heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.

Of course, lifestyle and diet matter, but coffee appears to be a helpful companion in living a longer, healthier life.

# 9. It’s an Accessible, Affordable Health Habit

One of the best things about coffee? It’s **easy to incorporate** into your routine. You don’t need fancy equipment, pricey supplements, or a complete lifestyle overhaul.

Just one cup, brewed your favorite way, can:

* Boost your brain
* Support your body
* Fuel your goals

And when you skip the sugar and creamers, you get all these benefits with **zero calories** — making it one of the most powerful and accessible health habits out there.

# Final Sip: Coffee Isn’t Just a Drink — It’s a Lifestyle

From its energizing properties to its disease-fighting antioxidants, the **benefits of coffee** go far beyond the cup. It’s a wellness tool, a mood enhancer, and even a longevity ally — all wrapped up in a warm, delicious experience.

So tomorrow morning, don’t just reach for your coffee because you “need it.” Reach for it because it’s an intentional act of self-care, focus, and vitality.

For five years, I worked at a Fortune 500 company that set the standard for what a healthy, supportive workplace should be. I didn’t realize how good I had it until I left. The workload was manageable—just 4–5 tasks a day creating presentation decks. Our leader genuinely cared, making sure we weren’t burning ourselves out. The benefits? Unmatched. A ₱250k HMO cap with coverage for two dependents, an in-house gym, a cafeteria that felt like a mall, coffee shops like Seattle’s Best *inside* the building, sleeping quarters, annual bonuses, and a salary that was above industry standards. It felt like the perfect job.

But after years in the same place, I started seeking new challenges. Then came the offer of another Fortune 500 company: a huge paycheck, a signing bonus, and the allure of working from home. It sounded like everything I wanted—until it wasn’t.

From day one, I knew I’d made a mistake. The workload was overwhelming—10 tasks per day each with multiple subtasks. I was working overtime from the get-go, and weekends weren’t off-limits. Yes, the salary was higher, but at the cost of my mental, emotional, and physical health. The HMO coverage for dependents? A far cry from what I had before—only ₱90k. And that work-life balance I used to enjoy? Gone.

Financially, sure, I'm earning more. But emotionally, I feel drained. The stress, the toxic culture of employees always nagging and fighting, the constant pressure—it's not worth it. I miss my old company deeply. I’ve even cried thinking about how good it was.

This experience has taught me a valuable lesson: **money isn't everything**. A healthy, enjoyable workplace is priceless. If you're thinking of making a move, do your research. Read company reviews on platforms like Glassdoor or JobStreet. Dig deeper than the salary figures.

I'm actually pissed off and disappointed but let's see what you think!



*  It started with a message from a recruiter in January.

I was interested and we set up an interview. About 1 hour and I stated my salary expectations of 78k base and 25k bonus. The position was quoted to me as 85k OTE (60k base, 25k bonus).

The recruiter told me that a solution could be found for the salary.



* The second interview was with the HR of the company, one hour and I mentioned my salary expectations again, she said that we will find a solution.



* Third interview with the manager I was supposed to work for, salary no problem and let's clarify.



* Fourth interview was with a future team colleague, that was quite nice



* Fifth interview with the Vice President, he gave me a verbal confirmation!



* Sixth interview: Then came a request to come to the office to get to know the team. I was brutally interrogated by 4 people, I thought they were drinking coffee haha



* Seventh interview was a presentation for which I spent two full days preparing. Introduction, business strategy, questions, and a pitch of the company. Three people took part. At the end I asked again if we could come together salary-wise. I was told that we'll work it out offline but that's not a problem



* Eighth interview was with the president of the company, mainly nasty questions



* The ninth interview was again with the VP, he criticized very funny things. He said I didn't look people in the eye and that I didn't have my time management under control during the presentation. BUT he would become my mentor and teach me everything and then he mentioned names of people who had already learned from him and how successful they all were now.

He then asked me if I really wanted to and if I was capable of learning. He told me to call him the next day to confirm that I wanted to. I then called him to confirm that I wanted to.



* Interview number ten with the manager. Nice but unnecessary



After all that and two months later I get an offer. It is 20k below my demand. I renegotiate, everyone knows my demand. The offer is increased by 1k. So 19k below my demand. I renegotiate again. A final offer is made to me. It is 15k below my current salary. They try to appease me with a bonus. I'm constantly being called by everyone involved.



I reject the offer.

I packed the bag, drove to the café without incident, and we sat down for a coffee and a much-needed chat. We talked about mental health, our babies, and our partners.

After their nap, both babies needed a change and a feed, so we headed to the parents’ room, celebrating how successful the catch up was.

I unpacked the bottle and the thermos to warm the milk... completely unaware of my mistake.

I had forgotten the bottle nipple.

Needless to say, the 30 minute drive home felt a lot longer with a hungry baby.

Since then, I will never, and have never since made that mistake.

1k6o9nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernLuxuryKitchen/comments/1k6o9nd/the_best_storage_solutions_in_modern_european/,The Best Storage Solutions in Modern European Kitchens,"Modern European kitchens are celebrated not just for their sleek aesthetics but for their deeply ingrained functionality. Storage is not an afterthought—it is central to the design process. Every drawer, cabinet, and shelf is purposefully crafted to maximize space, maintain clean lines, and support an efficient workflow. European designers emphasize minimalism and order, ensuring that each element serves a functional role without contributing to visual clutter. This approach results in kitchens that feel open and airy, regardless of size.

A defining feature of European kitchen storage is the use of integrated, modular systems. These systems allow homeowners to customize their spaces without compromising on design coherence. From hidden compartments to sliding vertical pantries, each component is strategically placed to support intuitive movement and effortless access. High-quality hardware, soft-close mechanisms, and seamless finishes ensure longevity and ease of use. Furthermore, the emphasis on vertical space and corner optimization illustrates how European kitchens turn potential problem areas into prime storage real estate.

Understanding this foundational philosophy is essential before delving into specific solutions. It reflects a broader cultural preference for efficiency and elegance, offering inspiration for any homeowner aiming to improve their kitchen’s storage potential.

## Vertical Storage: Reaching New Heights in Kitchen Efficiency

One of the most transformative innovations in modern kitchen design is the creative use of vertical space. European kitchens excel in this area, turning upper walls and previously unused areas into vital storage zones. Tall cabinetry, extending from floor to ceiling, is now standard in many layouts. These cabinets not only increase storage capacity but also contribute to the room’s visual symmetry and cleanliness.

High cabinets often house less frequently used items like seasonal cookware or specialty appliances. To enhance accessibility, many European models include pull-down shelves or ladder systems, ensuring that no storage space is out of reach. The exterior design of tall cabinetry maintains a seamless façade, often matching wall finishes or continuing the same material palette used throughout the kitchen.

Another example of vertical ingenuity is the use of narrow pull-out columns, particularly useful beside refrigerators or in tight gaps. These columns store spices, dry goods, or cleaning supplies in a compact format that’s easily accessible. Overhead open shelving has also gained popularity, offering display space without sacrificing storage. Thoughtfully positioned lighting in these vertical zones ensures visibility and adds to the overall ambiance.

Vertical storage not only increases usable space but also enhances the ergonomic flow of the kitchen, ensuring that everything needed is within arm’s reach—just better organized.

## Pull-Out Systems: The Unsung Heroes of Organized Kitchens

Pull-out storage solutions exemplify the best of European kitchen engineering. These systems allow users to access contents with minimal effort and maximum visibility. Common forms include pull-out pantries, corner units, and drawer inserts—all designed to optimize space and improve workflow. Unlike traditional cabinets that hide contents behind fixed doors, pull-out systems bring everything into view.

One of the most impactful versions is the pull-out pantry. These tall, narrow units slide out to reveal multiple tiers of storage, each accessible from both sides. They are perfect for dry goods and packaged foods and eliminate the need to rummage through deep shelves. Another popular model is the corner carousel or ""magic corner,"" which utilizes difficult corner spaces with rotating or sliding trays.

Drawer inserts also play a key role. Customizable compartments for utensils, spices, and even pots and pans allow each item to have a designated place. These inserts are often adjustable, accommodating changes in needs over time. European brands frequently use durable materials like brushed steel, high-quality plastics, and treated wood to ensure long-term performance.

Pull-out systems demonstrate how innovation in hardware and design can elevate a kitchen from ordinary to exceptional. They provide seamless access, improve organization, and reduce physical strain, making everyday cooking a pleasure rather than a chore.

## Hidden Storage: Keeping Clutter Behind the Scenes

One of the hallmarks of modern European kitchens is the ability to maintain an uncluttered appearance without sacrificing practicality. Hidden storage solutions are key to achieving this balance. These include toe-kick drawers, concealed appliances, and integrated pull-out bins—all of which blend into the cabinetry to preserve clean lines.

Toe-kick drawers, for instance, make use of the typically wasted space beneath lower cabinets. These shallow drawers are ideal for storing flat items like baking sheets, trays, or cutting boards. Similarly, appliance garages—compartments with roll-up or flip-up doors—keep small appliances like coffee makers or toasters out of sight but easily accessible.

Integrated bins and recycling centers also reflect this approach. Rather than freestanding trash cans that disrupt visual flow, pull-out waste systems fit neatly behind cabinet doors, often featuring multiple compartments for sorting. Another clever solution is the use of sliding doors or panels to hide entire cooking stations or prep areas, revealing them only when in use.

This commitment to concealment not only enhances visual appeal but also improves functionality. The kitchen remains visually serene, which contributes to a more enjoyable cooking experience. Hidden storage epitomizes the European approach: practical innovation disguised in elegance.

## Multifunctional Islands: Central Hubs with Surprising Capacity

Kitchen islands are no longer just countertops—they are multifunctional storage hubs. In modern European kitchens, islands often incorporate a mix of drawers, cabinets, shelves, and even appliances. This central location is ideal for items used most frequently, allowing the cook to operate with efficiency and minimal movement.

Many islands include deep drawers for pots and pans, slim cabinets for baking sheets, or open shelves for cookbooks and decor. Some go further, integrating wine racks, microwave drawers, or even mini-fridges. These additions are carefully planned so the island serves not just as a prep station but as a storage and socializing nucleus.

The flexibility of island storage also supports European values of customization. Depending on the layout and user habits, islands can be tailored to different needs: a baker might want cooling racks and flour bins, while a family might prioritize snack storage and built-in seating. High-quality materials and finishes ensure the island complements the rest of the kitchen design.

Beyond storage, islands often include power outlets, lighting, and smart tech ports, further enhancing their multifunctionality. This centralized, accessible storage option is a cornerstone of the modern European kitchen’s efficiency and user-focused design.

## Integrated Solutions for Appliances and Technology

The integration of appliances and technology into storage solutions has redefined the modern European kitchen. Built-in ovens, dishwashers, and refrigerators seamlessly align with cabinetry, maintaining the kitchen’s sleek appearance while improving usability. These integrations go beyond aesthetics—they are designed to enhance efficiency and convenience.

Cabinet-faced dishwashers and refrigerators preserve visual continuity and allow designers to maintain symmetry in layout. Slide-away doors for microwaves and ovens add another layer of concealment, especially useful in smaller spaces. These integrated appliances often include smart features like app control, self-cleaning functions, and energy-efficient settings, which are becoming increasingly standard.

Technology isn’t limited to appliances. Some modern cabinets now include built-in charging stations or motion-sensor lighting. Others feature internal LED strips that illuminate contents as soon as the door or drawer is opened. These additions enhance both the form and function of storage, ensuring that every detail supports a seamless culinary experience.

This level of integration exemplifies how storage in modern European kitchens is not isolated from other design considerations—it is an active participant in creating a harmonious, efficient, and enjoyable environment.

## Custom Cabinetry: Tailored Solutions for Unique Lifestyles

Custom cabinetry stands as one of the most versatile tools in the European kitchen design arsenal. Rather than relying on one-size-fits-all solutions, many homeowners and designers opt for tailor-made cabinets that reflect individual needs and preferences. This personalized approach enables more precise organization and maximizes every available inch.

Tailored cabinets can accommodate unusual kitchen layouts, support unique cooking habits, or address specific storage challenges. For instance, pull-out racks for heavy mixers, vertical slots for baking trays, or deep bins for bulk ingredients can all be integrated seamlessly. Even the interior layout of drawers can be adjusted to suit changing needs over time.

Materials and finishes are just as customizable. Whether choosing high-gloss lacquer, matte wood veneer, or industrial metals, each option contributes to the overall design ethos. Interior choices—such as velvet-lined cutlery trays or antimicrobial linings—enhance functionality further. European manufacturers often provide modular systems that can be fine-tuned at the factory or during installation.

The end result is a kitchen that works as beautifully as it looks. Custom cabinetry merges the practical with the personal, showcasing the full potential of thoughtful storage planning in a [european kitchens](https://www.leichtwestchester.com/kitchens) context.

## Smart Use of Kitchen Catalogs for Planning and Inspiration

Designing an efficient kitchen starts with the right inspiration, and few tools are more useful than [kitchen catalogs](https://www.leichtwestchester.com/catalogs). These catalogs offer a visual and technical overview of available options, helping homeowners and designers make informed decisions about storage solutions.

Catalogs highlight innovative features, from pull-out spice racks to integrated lighting systems, and provide insight into the latest design trends. They also help visualize how various materials and layouts work together, enabling better coordination of cabinetry, countertops, and appliances. For those considering upgrades, catalogs are often the first step in identifying which elements offer the best balance of style and utility.

Detailed measurements, material specifications, and design variations allow users to plan with precision. Many catalogs also include real-world installation examples, providing context for how solutions look and function in finished kitchens. This bridge between concept and execution is particularly valuable when exploring the range of [modern european kitchens](https://www.leichtwestchester.com/projects), where customization is a key selling point.

By using kitchen catalogs strategically, homeowners can ensure their storage solutions align with both practical needs and aesthetic goals. It’s a vital resource in the journey toward a more organized, elegant, and efficient kitchen space.

## Conclusion: Elevating the Everyday Through Intelligent Storage

Modern European kitchens exemplify how thoughtful design can transform daily life. Their storage solutions go beyond mere convenience—they shape the entire culinary experience. From vertical cabinetry and pull-out systems to hidden compartments and multifunctional islands, every feature is engineered for both form and function. What distinguishes these kitchens is their holistic integration of aesthetics and practicality, where even the smallest detail contributes to a larger vision of harmony and usability.

The importance of such storage innovation extends beyond simple organization. It affects how people interact with their space, cook meals, entertain guests, and maintain cleanliness. A well-organized kitchen reduces stress and enhances productivity, making it easier to prepare meals, store ingredients, and manage time effectively. These kitchens are designed to eliminate frustration, transforming daily chores into smoother, more pleasant experiences.

These innovations reflect a commitment to usability, elegance, and sustainability. The integration of custom cabinetry and smart technologies further enhances adaptability, allowing each kitchen to reflect the unique lifestyle of its users. They offer the flexibility to evolve alongside household needs, supporting a broad range of culinary activities and family routines. Whether guided by professional designers or inspired by detailed catalogs, the journey toward better kitchen storage is deeply personal—and profoundly rewarding. Ultimately, modern European kitchens redefine what it means to cook, gather, and live well within the heart of the home.

Hi everyone!

My partner and I (both early 30s) are heading to Costa Adeje, Tenerife for the first time next week and staying for 10 days. We're looking to make the most of our trip with a mix of relaxation and exploration.

We're particularly interested in:

Romantic or unique activities:  sunset spots, hidden beaches, scenic hikes, boat trips...

Vegan or vegetarian-friendly restaurants: Places with a great atmosphere, good cocktails, lovely views and kind to animals 🐾 

Nightlife: We're up for some fun evenings—live music, cozy bars, or clubs with a good vibe.

Coffee shops: Always on the hunt for great coffee and chill spots to relax (must have vegan alternatives for milk).


We appreciate any recommendations you might have. Personal favorites, hidden gems, or must-visit spots—please share!

I was shocked. It came completely out of the blue and I never saw it coming. He said he has been trying to fight a disconnect he felt with me for the past 2yrs and couldn't do it anymore. He then went out of town for 6 days for space and work and to give me and the kids some space. (19 yr old and 16 yr old ) I was a blubbering mess all of Friday and Saturday and then Sunday I started to feel a bit better. I was optimistic this time away would help him clear his head and we'd work things out. But I was also very much prepared for the fact that what I wanted wouldn't happen and so I made contact with a lawyer. ( We live in NZ so we need to be legally separated for 2yrs before we can divorce) he came home tonight and we spoke. 
As I suspected he's made his mind up. I asked him to be completely honest if there is anyone else and he looked me dead in the eyes and said he's not even interested in any type of relationship right now so I believe him. It was a good chat though, we both spoke about where we need to do better in relationships in general and I said to him I'd like to work on it but I won't push him. We talked about how we still want to be friends and there was some really good times over the years it just seems they're not there anymore. I just said I want to be friendly if we can for the kids and because we will be living in the same house for a while yet and he agreed, he doesn't want any animosity but said he'd understand if there is any from me. I said there really doesn't seem to be, I'm seeing things from his side and I honestly didn't really miss communicating with him while he was gone. So I am wondering if I have had a disconnect too and haven't really noticed it until all this happened.  We thanked each other for the talk and hugged at the end. He's sleeping in the lounge until the downstairs room is liveable, but all in all as sad as it is that it's over I'm glad we're ending it like this.

Polar bears are scary. I hope I never encounter one. They’re so beautiful though! And massive. I’ve been thinking about bear attacks because I saw in my notes from years ago I wrote down the whole *”if it’s black fight back if it’s brown lay down if it’s white goodnight”* and anyway since seeing that reminder I’ve been thinking about bear attacks. I hope I don’t ever get attacked by one. I’ve seen bears in the wild, in I can’t remember which national park but one of the ones in California. I think either Sequoia or Redwood? We went to both, as well as Yosemite. Anyway they were black bears I guess because there are no grizzlies left in California as far as I remember. And we saw the mama and her babies not even that far away. So I have seen wild bears! And we were walking around too, not in the car or anything. It was all snowy as well. I like bears. I like the name bear too. *Bear*. It’s funny because I also like the word pear. *Pear*. I guess I like that sound. I also like the name Gruyère and au pair. But so anyway I hope I don’t get caught in a bear attack. Or a shark attack. Or a moose chase. Or anything really. I hope no animals ever attack me. Touch wood. I was attacked by a weka once, on a hike with mum when I was maybe 14 idk. We were day two or three into the week long tramp and I was eating some crackers when we sat for a break and I was wearing a see through rain poncho as it was rainy and the little prick ran at me and swiped my crackers right through the poncho. I was also chased by a goose at a petting zoo place. Other than that I don’t think I’ve had any bad animal stories. I had a bee that may or may not have been in love with me. Dogs always seem to like me. Cats… idk cats are their own thing. Hm. But so anyway, I’ve been down a rabbit hole of polar bears and they’re so incredible. From afar. And the babbiiiessssss! So sweet. 

It’s insane how many young women look so much older because of the work they’ve had done. I just started watching a YT video about someone detailing how they’ve spent $10,000 on their face alone just this year so far - I thought wow yeah she looks great for her late thirties… she’s 22. **22.** She’s beautiful, but wow? She didn’t even have a plastic look to her, like not that generic obvious work done look, but the way she’s had her jaw/lower part of her face and nose and eyes done etc and idk, it all just makes for such a mature looking face. I find it bizarre. But I also cannot even comprehend the level of pressure these influencers must feel to look a certain way, but also I’m sorry but you kind of purposefully put yourself into this world knowing the requirements. It’s insane. I know I’ll eventually get little tweaks here and there like a bit of Botox and maybe a smidge of filler in my lips and otherwise just focusing on my skin and taking care of myself. I have zero issues about the people that do do all the things - I would diiiie to get my nose done for example but I also feel like as much as I hate aspects of my face and wish I had another… the idea of truly changing my appearance weirds me out? But then I fantasise about a cuter nose so idk. If I had a massive beak of a nose I’d maybe get it done but I don’t. 

Maybe I don’t want to ever get married. Which is funny because only earlier today I caught myself in a day dream about my honey proposing. So. Good to know how solid I am in my wants. But idk, I want the forever partner but the *marriage*? I don’t know. I don’t knoooow. All I glean from journaling is how little I bloody know. 

I’m cold. I wish I could soak in a big deep bath tub. With candles. In a nice clean room. And listen to Enya. That’s what I want right now. 

Sometimes I think I would be best suited to living alone forever. That way I can sing badly and for example I just had my head down my top/my top over my head for a bit because it was warmer and also I just feel like I smell really nice at the moment, I think my perfume which is that MM replica coffee break one, I sprayed it this morning so it’s just sort of in the fibres of my jersey and a bit on my skin and so when my head was under my top it just smelled so gooooodddddddd. But imagine walking in on someone with their jersey pulled over their head and hearing them take deep sniffy breaths of themselves? I guess I’d be single and living solo 
soon after that anyway. 

I’ve been watching a video on YT of this woman basically calling out influencers and stuff for blatant lying about all sorts of things. It’s quite refreshing. I like that she doesn’t name and shame them too, I think being called out in your comments section is good but to be publicly blasted for it seems idk… I’m not sure the line between getting called out and low key bullying occurs. That being said these influencer people are harming people themselves with these fabrications so idk. Anyway it’s just WILD. One fitness guy reusing the same client progress photo but with a different client name and timeline. A lot taking us through their 5-6am morning routine before “work” but their watch and oven and everything showing it’s midday every time (they do the routine basically every day so it’s not a one off to just show as an example) but that felt weird to me because what idiot would think it takes five minutes to shower and do teeth and then move your tripod and camera etc to the kitchen. Anyway. Another rich sorority girl saying she got two pairs of Chanel shoes and three Chanel bags and a Dior bag for Christmas and they’re blatant fakes but she says they’re real. THEY ARENT EVEN IN THE KIND KF BOX CHANEL SELLS. Etc etc etc. Lots of lies about appearance surgeries and procedures. Anyway. I consider myself able to sometimes tell when something isn’t real but I’m also quite gullible and assume everyone is better in every way than I am so therefore what they say about their amazing live must be real, it sounds weird but it makes sense but I’m also tired and cbf writing this anymore. 

I have to be up early for the busses tomorrow. Ugggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

1k6o0oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1k6o0oz/im_2_weeks_and_2_days_into_this_carnivore_diet/,I’m 2 weeks and 2 days into this Carnivore Diet and let me tell you…,"First let me describe the Carnivore Diet I am following the last few weeks since I started: strict carnivore diet (meat, eggs, butter from grass fed cows) and I cheated first week with an avocado and a pickle a day. This week I’ve only had a few pickles a day and one avocado. I haven’t found fermented pickles yet.

I’ve eaten more steak than I have my entire life/red meat. I actually switched to a nearly all sushi/fish diet in 2015 or ground turkey lean meat back when I was poor and then when I had money sushi all day baby. I thought I lost weight cause I cut red meat out and alcohol. Gained weight back or lost it, fluctuated between heaviest or what I was in my prime teen years.

Well now I eat red meat a lot. I love it. Marbled. I eat bacon every day, eggs usually at least 2, usually 4, would do more. I’ve had yellowfin tuna steak once, shrimp, salmon. Chicken breast, chicken legs, thighs. Oh, and coffee black in the morning. A glass of whole milk in the morning, sometimes at night with dinner. I cook with grass fed butter unsalted or salted or beef tallow or bacon grease or beef or chicken grease I have saved from days before. Kefir in the morning if I can remember (or the one time I undercooked the ground beef patties and got food poisoning where my stomach was upset and I threw up. Lasted 20 minutes, felt like I needed kefir, researched it and said it’s good to replenish probiotics after food poisoning which stopped the cramps and throwing up and all better).

I did this diet to get rid of my acid reflux which has been a constant since… forever? When I eat something too heavy I feel full and can’t finish. I don’t usually ever finish a meal/plate (now that’s all I do). I don’t throw up anymore from overeating feeling (I never usually ate that much, just always had a “small stomach” and could take 3 bites of a burger and be finished as an example).

While that’s why I started… more ailments are lifting! What are they? Sorry for the TMI in some of this: 

My skin! I’m not breaking out anymore on my back, chest, hips and butt. Red spots from previous breakouts are going away. My skin is healing. I gave up long ago trying to stay clean for no breakouts. I stay clean, they just happen. Not anymore.

This is a big one for me I’ve been dealing with since 2020: HEMORRHOIDS! 

I tried to get a colonoscopy to make sure I didn’t have colon cancer cause the non stop bleeding from hemorrhoids and it was also protrude out. They refused to give me one cause I’m too young. Confirmed they were roids. Gave me a pill to stick up there and special wipes beyond prep H that never worked. I’m not using any of this, haven’t in a while cause I got used to using restroom and sticking them back up every morning… bleeding DAILY.

But now? Bleeding has stopped. They still protrude somewhat but I can tell they are slowly returning to their proper place. No more strain or as much strain. As a kid I went #2 every 2 or 3 days. As an adult every day. But it took me 30 mins to an hour to get it all out. I learned to become scared of my own farts. Now it’s like 5 minutes and I’m done. Comes out much easier.

Turns out I didn’t need more fiber like my doc said? Long ago they told me to stop the daily pills for stool softener cause I could get addicted to it and bowels will get worse so I did and just dealt with the roids. Now they are leaving! Sorry this is just such a massive thing for me. 

Now one thing I’m hoping to address but I don’t know what’s gonna be right or not… first time my blood panel came back and now I have high cholesterol (end of last year that report); specifically I had 149 LDL which 0-99 was “normal.” They told me “you need to eat more fish and cut out red meat” and I said “all I eat is sushi!” Then they said “ok well then you should go on a 10 mg statin” and I said no. Realized I was eating more fatty fish like yellowtail and super white tuna etc. so maybe I should try cutting fat out of my sushi diet. 😂 

Now I’m eating all the meat I can, fat included. Butter included. Lots of red meat, exact opposite of what they told me. I know I need to do more testing to make sure my blood pressure is ok or something, no plaque in blood? Not sure how to go about that… but in June I’m supposed to do a super test or something that’s included with my insurance to do a deep dive in… something? I don’t know. My docs wouldn’t stop calling me so I scheduled it.

My dad has diabetes type 2 (discovered when he was older) my uncle got it when he was older and he died recently. I’m trying to live a healthy lifestyle where I never get it.

Anyway just thought I’d share my journey cause I’m amazed. No more acid reflux, no more throwing up, no more “full” feeling (is that bloated?), no more bleeding, skin healing/healed… and this is just a start! Now if I can get rid of the beer belly I’ve had since I was 5 years old that is probably made up of fast food, Olive Garden, and other eating out establishments.

And I was never taught to cook. I never cooked before. Now I’m having fun cooking. It’s easy, for one. But I’m moving on to explore how to make pork rind buns and cacao powder butter desserts. Sugar cravings gone mostly (eat yogurt when I get it) but I stashed away the frozen cacao butter treat in freezer for when I really want it.

I met this amazing woman (22F) about three years ago when a mutual friend of ours introduced us. That mutual friend has known her since they attended catechism classes together, so he’s been a bridge between us from the very start.

She’s currently in a serious relationship with another woman—she’s openly lesbian—and I know she cares about her partner a lot. In fact, she was even considering ending that relationship not too long ago, though I don’t know exactly why she decided to stay together. A while back, we had a really honest conversation where she confessed that she often struggles to find fulfillment in relationships with men.

Over time, we’ve developed an incredible rapport. We text almost every day, we hang out in a larger group setting, and we also manage to spend one-on-one time at least twice a week. Whenever we talk—whether it’s a quick message or a long coffee catch-up—the conversation always dives deep, and I feel like we connect on a level I’ve never experienced with anyone else.

Here’s where I’m stuck: I’m falling for her more and more, and I’m torn between being honest about my feelings and preserving the friendship we’ve built. She’s never been afraid to say “no” or to distance herself from people who don’t feel right to her, and I worry that if I confess, I might lose her entirely.

Questions for you all:

1. Should I let her know how I feel, even if it risks our friendship?


2. I realize reddit can’t predict the future—have any of you been in a similar situation? What did you do, and how did it turn out?


3. Any other advice or insights you can share would mean the world to me.

I’ve been living with them my whole life as 32 y/o woman, with an immune deficiency, and honestly…. “Deficiency” is an understatement, and belittling. I am INCAPABLE of waking up without pain, without swollen fingers, without muscle spasms, without eyes crusted shut so painfully that it hurt so ridiculously bad that you have to shout for your 60 year old mother to bring you a wet rag that morning, just to loosen the crust so you can actually open your eyes. Again, that’s just waking up. Then I evaluate how bad my tonsils and/or gums hurt, (bc literally something ALWAYS does hurt)… that way i can determine if I can risk having coffee that day or if I should just stick to water. I usually wake up several times a night dying of thirst, on top of night sweats. It’s typical for me to have  nightmares instead of none, which also goes to solidify my decision. Again, when waking up (if my heart hadn’t already decided to go off the rails), I then decide if my bowels can have coffee. Oh, I already mentioned coffee? That’s bc i I always wake up weary of the day….again, literally evaluating what hurts and what I am feeling. I realize that’s not the normal for most people, and I’ve been thinking about it over the years and have determined that suicide may be the best route for the future of my family. My mom has always expressed to me that suicide is selfish and unwarranted, and I used to believe that. Although, as I have grown older, I realize that my mental and physical burdens outweigh the joy I actually bring my family. Maybe that’s why I always tried to be “the funny one”. Maybe it’s why I always tried to make light of a heavy situation, bc I knew in the back of my mind that this was always what it would come to. I’m sorry to everyone this has burdened. Just know I tried, and there is NOTHING you could have done different. I love you, mom, you were and will ALWAYS be my best friend. I know I said we would always go together. I guess I’m just fucked up.  I AM happy just imagining not having to live with the physical pain I’ve endured since I was 16. I don’t know why I ended up having crippling back pain, shoulder and neck spasms, Myofascial pain disorder, Charley horses, chest pains, heart murmurs, muscles so tight they don’t function right for days, or any of it. lThe truth is I don’t want to kill myself, I just feel like I should. I hurt, and again there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to fix that. I’m not schizophrenic.  I’ve been feeling exceptionally well since starting the 75 mg of Effexor (after failed Zoloft for many months), but this is just something I haven’t been able to shake since I was super young. I’m chronically ill, and ever since I was young, like at least 9 or10 after breaking my ankles so many times, having breathing issues resulting in hospital stays, etc., I overheard my parents talking about how they couldn’t vacation with us kids anymore (I have one older brother), and how expensive it’d be if we were to continue to have to stay in hospitals for various reasons. Yes, those stays consisted of asthma/bronchitis, or Supraventrical Tachycardia. So after that,  I tried starting to hide my various illnesses until I was just miserable, which would typically land me back in the ER. I’m talking  2x as a kid, once in high school from a car wreck, and once in my late 20’s.  (That last ER trip in Macon was diagnosed as  “purchasing bad marijuana” and “anxiety”) when after I was discharged and sent to Columbia Hospital, they in fact found my second esophageal inguinal ring had closed, and they had to surgically balloon it back open. I feel like Robin Williams. He’s always making jokes and light of any situation, right? No one knew he was going to do it, he seemed happy.  At least, that was the comedic familiar figure we came to know and love, but you could see behind his eyes that he was always silently sad and suffering.. Why does it seem like most comedians do?

1k6ns2m,https://i.redd.it/ilrlqfmx1rwe1.jpeg,Toxic Minimalism: When ‘Less is More’ Becomes ‘Less is Life’,"At some point in our aesthetic evolution, something took a weird turn.  
Creative mess became a sin, decorative objects a faux pas, and colour… well, colour became something only the reckless dare to touch.  
Welcome to the world of **toxic minimalism**, where every extra coffee cup feels like a moral failure.

# The cult of white and the altar of emptiness

Let’s be fair — minimalism started off well.  
It was born out of zen, Scandinavian calm, and architecture that breathes.  
But like all good things, it got… culty.

It went from philosophy to doctrine.  
From conscious choice to design dogma.  
From “living with less” to “living with *nothing* and silently judging your neighbour’s book collection.”

There’s now an entire generation convinced that happiness requires just three things:

* A clear glass,
* A matte white table,
* And zero visual emotion.

(If there’s a vase, it better be beige — or the ghost of Marie Kondo will whisper passive-aggressively in your sleep.)

# When absence becomes identity

There’s something eerie about hyper-controlled spaces.  
Not because they’re ugly — quite the opposite.  
But sometimes the **emptiness** is the only thing with a voice.

Perfect homes, where every object is so curated it looks staged.  
Bookshelves with three lonely books.  
Beds without pillows.  
Sofas you don’t sit on — you admire them from across the room, with reverence and guilt.

Is this really the kind of design that tells our story?  
Or just another way to say, *“look how little I need to look better than you”*?

# Design as a short blanket

In the name of minimalism, we’ve deleted complexity.  
The past. The human mess. The taste of real people.  
Anything that doesn’t “serve a function” gets the axe.

But who decides what’s functional?

That slightly wonky ceramic bowl your uncle made might not be “essential,”  
— but maybe it holds a story, a memory, a human gesture.  
And sometimes it’s that gesture that turns a space from showroom to home.

# Less is bore

Yes, you read that right.

Because the risk of toxic minimalism is… total aesthetic boredom.  
Copy-paste houses. Identikit Instagram profiles.  
Walls so neutral you start questioning if *you* exist.

And no, I’m not calling for a shabby chic comeback (god forbid).  
I’m just wondering if there’s a middle ground between “too much stuff” and “absolutely no soul.”

# Intentional minimalism > Performative minimalism

Healthy minimalism doesn’t judge, doesn’t flaunt, and doesn’t post on Pinterest.  
It’s personal. Quiet. Unpretentious.  
It clears space **inside**, not just on shelves.

Toxic minimalism, on the other hand, is lifestyle theatre.  
It’s luxury 2.0: not *what* you own, but *how little* you show — while secretly spending a fortune to make that nothing look perfect.

So here’s the final question:

Imagine receiving an energetic tune-up just by pressing play. No needles. No hassle. Just good vibes flowing through your body.

# Who Created This Sonic Magic?

The mastermind behind this mind-body treat is **Eric Thompson**, a pioneer in biofield entrainment and consciousness tech. He previously worked on a program called *Audio Chi* (also awesome), but he decided to level it up. His mission? To help people unlock healing, vitality, and a deeper state of awareness using nothing but sound and subtle energy signatures. Sounds wild? Oh, it is.

# Why Would Anyone Use Digital Acupuncture?

Let’s be honest—we all carry some stress baggage. Whether it’s daily burnout, anxiety, or that annoying tension in your shoulders, *Audio Acupuncture - iAwake Technologies* was designed to help. It’s for anyone who wants to feel **uplifted**, **calm**, **grounded**, and maybe even a little **euphoric**—without popping pills or booking a $120 acupuncture session.

Users are reporting crazy cool stuff: tingling sensations, chakra activations, and a solid feeling of being rooted in the *now*. Some say it’s better than coffee (seriously). Others use it to enhance meditation, feel more creative, or simply chill out after hours of screen time.

# When and How Should You Use It?

The beauty? This thing’s flexible. You can:

* **Blast it on speakers** to infuse your room with healing energy
* **Use headphones** for deep dives into meditation or healing
* Or here’s the kicker—**play it silently** (volume at zero!) and still get the benefits through the subtle biofield tech. That’s next-level stealth mode.

Three 20-minute tracks. No loops. Just a natural, flowing soundscape of nature designed to gently balance your system.

# Where Does the Healing Magic Happen?

Not just in your ears, my friend—it happens all throughout your **acupuncture meridian system**. The audio contains embedded energetic signatures that align with the **human acupuncture map**, clearing blockages and boosting the flow of *qi* (your life force energy). You’re basically getting an energetic massage through your headphones or speakers.

# How Does This Wizardry Work?

Unlike other programs that rely on traditional audio brainwave entrainment, *Audio Acupuncture - iAwake Technologies* uses **biofield entrainment**. Think of it as energy frequencies so subtle, yet so potent, that they sync up with your body’s natural healing blueprint. The embedded tech includes:

* **White Light** for spiritual clarity
* **Qi** for calming energy
* **Orgone and sacred geometries** for deep cleansing
* Plus, **Alpha, Theta, and Delta brainwaves** for extra mental peace

It’s not just techy—it’s *alchemical*.

# Final Thoughts: Is Audio Acupuncture Worth It?

If you’re looking for something that feels like a meditation, a healing session, and a nature walk all in one—this is it. *Audio Acupuncture - iAwake Technologies* offers something rare: a non-invasive, zero-effort tool that actually helps you feel more like yourself. Calm, clear, and recharged.

Not gonna lie—this is one of those programs you *feel*, not just hear. If your nervous system is begging for a reset, give this one a go. You might just be surprised how much a little sound can shift your entire energy.",1,1745485666.0,RasoLearning,1,1.0,False

1k6no8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1k6no8c/is_it_normal_to_still_have_tenderness_on_my_heel/,Is it normal to still have tenderness on my heel after Achilles tendon repair surgery at the points where screws of some kind were drilled into the heel? I'm coming up on one year post-op,"41m, 6'2 275 lbs. 

I've since moved outside the U.S. to a remote area, so I can't call the doctor who did the surgery to ask. 

I ruptured my left Achilles in June 2024 and shortly thereafter had the repair surgery. 

# Questions: 

How long is generally common for the heel to be tender at the point where the screws were inserted? 

Anything I can do / should be doing to make this better? 

Anything I should really watch out for in the future until I'm able to get back home and get checked out? 

# The Issue: 

The two scars on my heel are what is tender. 

Neither scar is tender just to the touch, but if I massage around either scar or press directly on it with some pressure, it gets tender. 

If I kick my feet up on my coffee table, I can't have the heel resting on a hard surface as it starts to hurt. 

Pain is only really acute if I bump my heel into something or if I press down on it firmly. When this happens, it's just ""angry"" pain, like when you stub your toe and want to throw something. No throbbing or tearing type pain. 

# Repair Surgery Details: 

I'm not 100% certain of the technique they used, but they did a vertical incision at the rupture and there were some small holes on both sides of my leg where I'm assuming they ran the sutures through. 

I also have a scar on either side of my heel bone where the tendon connects to the bone, so I'm assuming this is where they drilled and ran some screws in there to tie the sutures to. 

See post-op picture [here](https://imgur.com/a/ZOVHPtH). 

Found a Youtube [video ](https://youtu.be/2qQZum0H6z4?si=irTPvgfemi-I-6DM)that seems to look like what happened to me based on the scars. It's an animation that shows the Achilles Midsubstance Speedbridge Implant System. 

# Supplemental Info: 

I don't run or play sports anymore. I do swim fairly regularly, both in the pool and snorkeling with fins. 

I stay pretty active with work and usually log about 10-12k steps per day six days a week, and I ride a bike 1/2 mile to/from work everyday. 

I did 10 weeks of physical therapy after surgery and was very light on the leg for six months post-op before going back overseas. 

I do 90% of all my walking in work boots with cushioned insoles. The rest of the time it's flip-flops or minimalist running shoes.

1k6nmv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jessandgabrielsnark/comments/1k6nmv5/how_much_longer_are_they_going_to_milk_this/,How much longer are they going to milk this?,"I was watching Jess’s new vlog, and she mentioned making a to-do list while her parents were in town, basically so she could get things done while they helped with the kids. And honestly, it struck me as kind of weird. Like… they both work from home (if that’s even what you’d call it), so why does she have to wait for her parents to be around to finally tackle stuff? She has a whole husband.

People have said before that Gabe gives off serious “low-effort dad” vibes, not exactly a deadbeat, but definitely not as involved as he should be. And considering how openly Christian they are, it kind of makes sense in a sad way. Their whole dynamic screams that traditional “man versus woman’s role in the home” thing, where Jess is expected to handle the kids, the cleaning, the cooking, the errands, the emotional labor, while Gabe vanishes into the basement to write movie scripts that are never going to see daylight. She’s running the entire household while he floats from one project to the next.

And to be fair, Jess has been the financial backbone of that family for years. Gabe has tried everything, clothing lines, podcasts, coffee companies, you name it, he’s dipped a toe in it. But nothing ever sticks. He’s been in this “figuring it out” era for like a decade.

And let’s not act like they’re struggling financially. They’ve clearly made smart money moves over the years. They sold that $4 million house in Boca, then there was the house they renovated and flipped, the one-bedroom apartment they bought and sold, and probably other behind-the-scenes investments we don’t even know about. They’ve had multiple properties and definitely aren’t hurting for cash. So with all that financial security and flexibility, it just makes Gabe’s lack of effort even more noticeable.

I actually watched Gabe’s latest vlog on his personal channel recently, which, let’s be honest, is probably another one and done comeback. He does this every year, one big “I’m back” moment, followed by radio silence. He hasn’t been consistent on that channel since the Jess and Gabriel channel blew up. Back then, they were posting regularly, at least once a week or every other week, and Jess was uploading solo content consistently too. But once the kids came into the picture, everything shifted. The Jess and Gabe channel slowed down and eventually died off, and now we get, what, one video a month from Jess？

And even when she does post, it’s always sponsored. Like, every video. I get that sponsorships pay the bills, but there used to be a balance, some regular vlogs mixed in with the ads. Now it just feels like everything is curated to push a product. It gives “I don’t really care about my audience as long as the check clears.” The content’s gotten super repetitive too. It’s always the same cozy sit-down vlog where she says “cozy” like twelve times and talks about how busy she is without ever really showing us anything different. I used to really enjoy watching them, but now? It’s just boring, inauthentic, overdone.

Oh, and in that vlog, Gabe was promoting merch for his New Earth brand, which has been on and off forever, just like conteam clothing. And I’m just sitting there thinking, who is buying this stuff? It’s giving overpriced, underwhelming, and “slap a logo on it and call it passion project.” I wouldn’t spend a dime on it, it’s clearly a money grab at this point.

I’m not trying to be a hater. I liked them. A lot of us did. But somewhere along the way, the authenticity got lost, the content turned into a commercial, and the vibe just changed. Now it feels like Jess is stuck in hustle mode trying to hold everything together while Gabe is off in his “creative” basement that never quite delivers.

Which will allow you to change how you see social anxiety forever.

After helping hundreds of people overcome their social fears and anxiety, I discovered something that most “social skills advice” completely misses.

Think about it — how many times have you:

* Been told to “just be confident”
* Tried forcing yourself to be more social
* Practiced conversation “techniques”
* Read endless tips about body language
* Pushed yourself out of your comfort zone

And yet… nothing really changed. Maybe you had moments of feeling better, but then fell right back into the same patterns.

Why?

Because all these methods focus on the OUTSIDE, when the real cause of social anxiety is on the INSIDE.

‎‎‎

# The Hidden Truth About Social Anxiety

The reality is — social anxiety isn’t actually about “lack of social skills” or “not knowing what to say.”

It’s about **resistance** — wanting things to be different from the way they are.

Your brain is designed to protect you from pain and danger. And it does this based on what it has learned through past experiences (your beliefs and memories).

Think back to your early experiences:

* That time you said something “wrong” and everyone laughed
* When you felt rejected or excluded
* Times you were judged or criticized
* Moments you felt “not good enough”

Each of these experiences created a memory in your subconscious mind. A belief about what social situations mean.

Now, years later… whenever you’re in a social situation, your mind remembers all those painful associations.  It still runs on all the meaning you assigned long ago. And begins to create anxiety to protect you from potential pain.

This is why you:

* Overthink what to say
* Worry about being judged
* Feel your mind going blank
* Get physical anxiety symptoms
* Avoid social situations

Our minds cannot distinguish physical threat & danger (outside), from an emotional one (inside). So your mind is trying to move you away from what it perceives as danger. 

For many this get's worse when it gets paired with Physical Anxiety (hormonal imbalance state). When the body uses up Testosterone (in men) and Progesterone (in women) we are left with more estrogen. Estrogen is healing and recovery hormone and can sensitize the body and slow down the body. 

The mind knows, that we are less likely to survive when we are weaker, so it creates more uncertain through, more wary behavior, we see the triggers more and in more extreme weakness cases - get panic attacks (fall into uncertainty, lack of control).

The mind is saying, 'Hey, rest, heal up, restore your energy and then go'.

‎ ‎‎

# Why Most Social Anxiety Advice Fails

Most social skills advice or even counselling completely misses this crucial point.

They tell you to:

* Practice small talk
* Change the way you think
* Reframe things
* Push through the fear or say 'just be yourself'
* Or take drugs...

But here’s the problem — if you have old subconscious patterns about social situations being painful or dangerous… your subconscious mind will ALWAYS create resistance.

It’s like trying to drive with the handbrake on. You can push the gas pedal harder (force yourself to be social), but you’ll never drive smoothly until you release the brake (change those patterns).

This is why many fail to overcome social anxiety.

‎‎

# The Real Solution: Rewiring Old Subconscious Patterns

I’ve helped hundreds of people completely overcome social anxiety by addressing the root cause — their limiting patterns & beliefs. You have to address the triggers that keep re-occurring, so that when the mind no longer perceives potential bad thing happening - it doesn't create anxiety, ever again.

One of my students had such severe anxiety he couldn’t even order coffee. After we changed his limiting beliefs around social situations… within 30 days he was comfortably speaking in meetings, connecting with new people, even giving presentations.

The key is understanding that we all have limiting patterns (inside experiences) about:

* Not being good enough
* Being judged
* Being seen doing wrong
* Speaking up not being safe 
* Not belonging
* Being different/weird

Those moments someone laughed at you in school? The feeling you felt inside - became a memory.

Those moments when parents shouted and you cried? The feeling you felt inside - became a memory of how painful it feels to be bad, do bad. And now without any awareness, your mind may be judging everything you do, predicting a - potential - of it going wrong.

These invisible patterns create your social anxiety… influence your thoughts… drive your emotions… and determine your experience.

‎‎

# How Subconscious Beliefs Can Help Overcome Social Anxiety

The truth about social anxiety is that your beliefs shape:

* **Your Perceptions**: How you interpret social situations, what you notice about others’ reactions, and how you think others see you. Once perception occurs - we think and reason from how we feel about it.
* **Your Emotions**: How much anxiety you feel in social situations, how comfortable you feel expressing yourself, and your emotional responses to others. 
* **Your Actions**: What you say and do, how naturally you express yourself, and whether you engage socially or avoid it.
* **Your Results**: The connections you make, how others respond to you, and the quality of your social experiences.

‎‎

# The Process of Transformation

Here’s the exact process to permanently transform your social anxiety. This is based on my over a decade expertise in Neuroscience, Psychology and medicine:

1. **Identify Your Limiting Patterns & Beliefs** \- This is the hardest step. Most of us think we can 'See' our thoughts, our beliefs and we know how the world is. However to identify limiting beliefs, you have to look beneath the surface. Beneath your conscious thoughts, and observe the deeper - subconscious thoughts arise. (I recommend reading 'The Power of Positive Thinking' to understand how subconscious creates thoughts (triggers) -> that lead to emotions and experiences)
2. **Use QPH Method Questions to Retrain Focus (Patterns):** When one focuses on wanting to be confident, it implies that he is not - and often this is what he experiences. But when one focuses on how confident he is, he cannot want to be confident. Because he see's himself being it. By the law of polarity the mind can only see one side of the coin at one moment in time. So you have to identify your desires, and triggers and flip them into the positive. And then you have to control your focus to see it. How do You do that? You have to ask - positive assumptive questions (eg. How confident am I?). Asking questions controls our Reticular Activating System in the brain. The very same function that is focusing to identify those painful experiences, controls our eyes - we see it, feel it and experience it. 
3. **Create New Evidence Daily** All subconscious beliefs need evidence. You have to repeat these questions so that your mind begins to identify the positive side and naturally eliminate the negative.  This is how you start building new positive associations.
4. **Reinforce for 21–30 Days** To make beliefs permanent, you need to make it a habit. Write these questions down. Read them every day at night and in the morning for 30 days. Same exact question.

‎‎Using this method I was able to change thousands of subconscious patterns and beliefs and always predictably and precisely see a change happen. In myself and in other students. First at most fundamental (root cause) level. And over time, every single thought, emotion, experience - shaping our circumstances changed as well.



# What Actually Changes

Once you transform these limiting beliefs, amazing things start to happen over time:

* Words begin to flow naturally without overthinking
* Worries about judgment can vanish
* Psychological anxiety symptoms disappear
* You feel free to be yourself and feel good
* Others respond to you and see you better
* Social situations become - natural

Why? Because you’ve removed those invisible barriers in your mind. You’re no longer fighting against subconscious resistance. Your mind is no longer working against you. Because you train it, to work for you. When you want to connect - you naturally feel safe doing it.

‎‎

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don’t “Fake It Till You Make It”** Faking it only creates more internal conflict. Your subconscious knows it’s fake, and others can sense the disconnect (through empathy/mirror neurons we have).
2. **Don’t Force Yourself** Pushing yourself to be more social reinforces that it’s unnatural friction, creates more resistance, and builds negative associations - pushing you into avoidance and isolation even more.
3. **Don’t Judge Yourself for Having Anxiety** Self-judgment only adds more resistance, and builds more limiting beliefs, making transformation even harder and more complex. Accept yourself, by asking 'How good am I the way I am?'. This is the first step to neutralize resistance, and replace it with acceptance.

‎‎

# The Path Forward

The reality is — you were born free. Watch any child… they express themselves naturally without fear. But then the world teaches us different experiences. Some are good, some are bad. And the brain always prioritizes to avoid bad, to help us be safe (survive).

Your social anxiety came from experiences that instilled those limiting patterns beliefs. Address the root cause, the first level of experience creation… and you'll return to your natural state of social freedom.

Remember, you’re not broken, anxiety is not who you are, and you don’t lack social skills. You just have your mind working overtime, trying to protect you from things that may not even be rational. The old programming just needs to be updated. So that you become the hero of your life.

You can become strong, feel confident and do, be or have anything! But you must ***Believe.***",2,1745484965.0,getdisciplined,2,0.75,False

* Words begin to flow naturally without overthinking
* Worries about judgment can vanish
* Psychological anxiety symptoms disappear
* You feel free to be yourself and feel good
* Others respond to you and see you better
* Social situations become - natural

Why? Because you’ve removed those invisible barriers in your mind. You’re no longer fighting against subconscious resistance. Your mind is no longer working against you. Because you train it, to work for you. When you want to connect - you naturally feel safe doing it.

‎‎

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don’t “Fake It Till You Make It”** Faking it only creates more internal conflict. Your subconscious knows it’s fake, and others can sense the disconnect (through empathy/mirror neurons we have).
2. **Don’t Force Yourself** Pushing yourself to be more social reinforces that it’s unnatural friction, creates more resistance, and builds negative associations - pushing you into avoidance and isolation even more.
3. **Don’t Judge Yourself for Having Anxiety** Self-judgment only adds more resistance, and builds more limiting beliefs, making transformation even harder and more complex. Accept yourself, by asking 'How good am I the way I am?'. This is the first step to neutralize resistance, and replace it with acceptance.

‎‎

# The Path Forward

The reality is — you were born free. Watch any child… they express themselves naturally without fear. But then the world teaches us different experiences. Some are good, some are bad. And the brain always prioritizes to avoid bad, to help us be safe (survive).

Your social anxiety came from experiences that instilled those limiting patterns beliefs. Address the root cause, the first level of experience creation… and you'll return to your natural state of social freedom.

Remember, you’re not broken, anxiety is not who you are, and you don’t lack social skills. You just have your mind working overtime, trying to protect you from things that may not even be rational. The old programming just needs to be updated. So that you become the hero of your life.

You can become strong, feel confident and do, be or have anything! But you must ***Believe.***",0,1745484954.0,selfhelp,1,0.5,False

Which will allow you to change how you see social anxiety forever.

After helping hundreds of people overcome their social fears and anxiety, I discovered something that most “social skills advice” completely misses.

Think about it — how many times have you:

* Been told to “just be confident”
* Tried forcing yourself to be more social
* Practiced conversation “techniques”
* Read endless tips about body language
* Pushed yourself out of your comfort zone

And yet… nothing really changed. Maybe you had moments of feeling better, but then fell right back into the same patterns.

Why?

Because all these methods focus on the OUTSIDE, when the real cause of social anxiety is on the INSIDE.

‎‎‎

# The Hidden Truth About Social Anxiety

The reality is — social anxiety isn’t actually about “lack of social skills” or “not knowing what to say.”

It’s about **resistance** — wanting things to be different from the way they are.

Your brain is designed to protect you from pain and danger. And it does this based on what it has learned through past experiences (your beliefs and memories).

Think back to your early experiences:

* That time you said something “wrong” and everyone laughed
* When you felt rejected or excluded
* Times you were judged or criticized
* Moments you felt “not good enough”

Each of these experiences created a memory in your subconscious mind. A belief about what social situations mean.

Now, years later… whenever you’re in a social situation, your mind remembers all those painful associations.  It still runs on all the meaning you assigned long ago. And begins to create anxiety to protect you from potential pain.

This is why you:

* Overthink what to say
* Worry about being judged
* Feel your mind going blank
* Get physical anxiety symptoms
* Avoid social situations

Our minds cannot distinguish physical threat & danger (outside), from an emotional one (inside). So your mind is trying to move you away from what it perceives as danger. 

For many this get's worse when it gets paired with Physical Anxiety (hormonal imbalance state). When the body uses up Testosterone (in men) and Progesterone (in women) we are left with more estrogen. Estrogen is healing and recovery hormone and can sensitize the body and slow down the body. 

The mind knows, that we are less likely to survive when we are weaker, so it creates more uncertain through, more wary behavior, we see the triggers more and in more extreme weakness cases - get panic attacks (fall into uncertainty, lack of control).

The mind is saying, 'Hey, rest, heal up, restore your energy and then go'.

‎ ‎‎

# Why Most Social Anxiety Advice Fails

Most social skills advice or even counselling completely misses this crucial point.

They tell you to:

* Practice small talk
* Change the way you think
* Reframe things
* Push through the fear or say 'just be yourself'
* Or take drugs...

But here’s the problem — if you have old subconscious patterns about social situations being painful or dangerous… your subconscious mind will ALWAYS create resistance.

It’s like trying to drive with the handbrake on. You can push the gas pedal harder (force yourself to be social), but you’ll never drive smoothly until you release the brake (change those patterns).

This is why many fail to overcome social anxiety.

‎‎

# The Real Solution: Rewiring Old Subconscious Patterns

I’ve helped hundreds of people completely overcome social anxiety by addressing the root cause — their limiting patterns & beliefs. You have to address the triggers that keep re-occurring, so that when the mind no longer perceives potential bad thing happening - it doesn't create anxiety, ever again.

One of my students had such severe anxiety he couldn’t even order coffee. After we changed his limiting beliefs around social situations… within 30 days he was comfortably speaking in meetings, connecting with new people, even giving presentations.

The key is understanding that we all have limiting patterns (inside experiences) about:

* Not being good enough
* Being judged
* Being seen doing wrong
* Speaking up not being safe 
* Not belonging
* Being different/weird

Those moments someone laughed at you in school? The feeling you felt inside - became a memory.

Those moments when parents shouted and you cried? The feeling you felt inside - became a memory of how painful it feels to be bad, do bad. And now without any awareness, your mind may be judging everything you do, predicting a - potential - of it going wrong.

These invisible patterns create your social anxiety… influence your thoughts… drive your emotions… and determine your experience.

‎‎

# How Subconscious Beliefs Can Help Overcome Social Anxiety

The truth about social anxiety is that your beliefs shape:

* **Your Perceptions**: How you interpret social situations, what you notice about others’ reactions, and how you think others see you. Once perception occurs - we think and reason from how we feel about it.
* **Your Emotions**: How much anxiety you feel in social situations, how comfortable you feel expressing yourself, and your emotional responses to others. 
* **Your Actions**: What you say and do, how naturally you express yourself, and whether you engage socially or avoid it.
* **Your Results**: The connections you make, how others respond to you, and the quality of your social experiences.

‎‎

# The Process of Transformation

Here’s the exact process to permanently transform your social anxiety. This is based on my over a decade expertise in Neuroscience, Psychology and medicine:

1. **Identify Your Limiting Patterns & Beliefs** \- This is the hardest step. Most of us think we can 'See' our thoughts, our beliefs and we know how the world is. However to identify limiting beliefs, you have to look beneath the surface. Beneath your conscious thoughts, and observe the deeper - subconscious thoughts arise. (I recommend reading 'The Power of Positive Thinking' to understand how subconscious creates thoughts (triggers) -> that lead to emotions and experiences)
2. **Use QPH Method Questions to Retrain Focus (Patterns):** When one focuses on wanting to be confident, it implies that he is not - and often this is what he experiences. But when one focuses on how confident he is, he cannot want to be confident. Because he see's himself being it. By the law of polarity the mind can only see one side of the coin at one moment in time. So you have to identify your desires, and triggers and flip them into the positive. And then you have to control your focus to see it. How do You do that? You have to ask - positive assumptive questions (eg. How confident am I?). Asking questions controls our Reticular Activating System in the brain. The very same function that is focusing to identify those painful experiences, controls our eyes - we see it, feel it and experience it. 
3. **Create New Evidence Daily** All subconscious beliefs need evidence. You have to repeat these questions so that your mind begins to identify the positive side and naturally eliminate the negative.  This is how you start building new positive associations.
4. **Reinforce for 21–30 Days** To make beliefs permanent, you need to make it a habit. Write these questions down. Read them every day at night and in the morning for 30 days. Same exact question.

‎‎Using this method I was able to change thousands of subconscious patterns and beliefs and always predictably and precisely see a change happen. In myself and in other students. First at most fundamental (root cause) level. And over time, every single thought, emotion, experience - shaping our circumstances changed as well.



# What Actually Changes

Once you transform these limiting beliefs, amazing things start to happen over time:

* Words begin to flow naturally without overthinking
* Worries about judgment can vanish
* Psychological anxiety symptoms disappear
* You feel free to be yourself and feel good
* Others respond to you and see you better
* Social situations become - natural

Why? Because you’ve removed those invisible barriers in your mind. You’re no longer fighting against subconscious resistance. Your mind is no longer working against you. Because you train it, to work for you. When you want to connect - you naturally feel safe doing it.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don’t “Fake It Till You Make It”** Faking it only creates more internal conflict. Your subconscious knows it’s fake, and others can sense the disconnect (through empathy/mirror neurons we have).
2. **Don’t Force Yourself** Pushing yourself to be more social reinforces that it’s unnatural friction, creates more resistance, and builds negative associations - pushing you into avoidance and isolation even more.

I just want to make the point that the scales (ignoring biometric scales) measure weight loss and not fat loss.

Weight varies by, time of the month, hydration, poo, inflammation, muscle growth and numerous other reasons.

Looking at a couple of weeks and saying you've ""stalled"" isn't accurate.  You may weigh the same, but you won't be able to say you haven't lost fat.

If you are eating in a calorie deficit, you will have lost fat, that's your bodies food.  For numerous other reasons your body may weigh more (mine was quite a big poo this morning ;)) and that means the fat loss is compensated by muscle, or fluid or poo.

Please... trust the process and just confirm to yourself, the scales are on a lag, they won't show fat loss immediately because it's only a part of weight loss.",3,1745484746.0,mounjarouk,6,0.67,False

I’m writing from Belgium and wanted to share a rather frustrating story — both to vent and to ask for advice.

I sent my De’Longhi [ECAM612.55.SB](http://ECAM612.55.SB) espresso machine to their Belgian repair service because water had stopped coming out. I couldn’t remove the front cover myself to check the injector, so I figured something was wrong internally.

De’Longhi sent me a quote: **€199.01 for a flat-rate repair**. They also said I could refuse and just pay **€20 to get the machine back unrepaired**. Since I had no idea what was wrong, I reluctantly agreed.

Two weeks later, I got my machine back… and according to the official repair report, the only thing they did was **replace the water filter (DLSC002)** in the tank. That’s it. The machine wasn’t broken. The filter — a **consumable part** I could have replaced myself for €10 — was just clogged.

Here’s what their repair summary literally says:



>*“The filter in the reservoir was defective, we are including a new filter with the repair.”*

>*Parts replaced: 1x DLSC002 Water Filter Kit*

I contacted De’Longhi to explain that this wasn’t a real repair. There was **no internal issue**, **no faulty parts**, no diagnosis that I couldn’t have done myself. Their response? The flat-rate includes logistics, diagnostics, admin costs, and “renewed warranty” (for a filter??), so tough luck.

I told them I would have GLADLY paid the €20 to get my machine back and buy my own filter if they had told me what the problem was. But they didn’t. They offered no detail about what was wrong until after I’d paid nearly €200.

So… I’m now **escalating this to the Belgian consumer mediation service and SPF Économie**. I believe it might fall under **Article VI.97 of the Belgian Economic Law Code**, which prohibits misleading commercial practices — including making a consumer believe a repair is necessary when it’s not.

What do you think? Is this legal? Has anyone experienced something similar with repair services that abuse the “flat-rate” system?

1k6n5fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1k6n5fa/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_with_my_best_friend/,"My Girlfriend Cheated on Me with My Best Friend and Dumped Me on Our Wedding Day. Two Years Later, I'm a Millionaire and She's Begging for Help.","We were high school sweethearts. The kind of couple people thought would make it forever — prom king and queen cliché and all. I met her when I was 16, fell stupidly in love, and never looked back. We went to the same college, moved in together after graduation, and five years later, I proposed. She said yes with tears in her eyes. It felt like a fairytale.

Or at least, I thought it did.

What I didn’t know — couldn’t have imagined — was that for the last year of our engagement, she was sleeping with my best friend, Nick. Nick, who I had known since middle school. Nick, who I made my best man. Nick, who helped me plan the proposal. That betrayal hits different when it comes from the person you trusted like a brother.

The morning of the wedding, everything seemed fine. My parents were buzzing around, the venue looked amazing, the music was perfect. I was nervous, sure, but excited. I kept thinking, this is it. This is the day everything changes. And I was right, but not in the way I expected.

Ten minutes before the ceremony, Nick walked into the groom’s suite. He looked pale, like he hadn’t slept. I thought something had happened to her — an accident maybe. But no. He just said, “She’s not coming,” and sat down like he’d just taken a bullet. I asked why, panic flooding my chest. He couldn’t look me in the eye. That’s when I knew something was wrong — really wrong.

He didn’t say the words. She did. She called me five minutes later. Crying. Saying she never loved me the way I deserved, that she and Nick didn’t plan to fall in love, but it just “happened,” and it felt “right.” She said she didn’t want to start a life built on a lie.

She left me at the altar. With my best friend.

I wish I could say I handled it with grace. I didn’t. I spiraled. I went no contact, moved to another city, cut ties with everyone who knew them. I quit my job and started freelancing just to survive. I lived in a one-bedroom apartment above a laundromat and cried more than I’ll ever admit.

But then something shifted. Maybe it was the anger. Maybe it was the realization that they didn’t deserve to ruin the rest of my life too. I started working like a madman. Built a product — a simple project management tool for freelancers like me. It took off. Got some traction. Got funded. Grew. Two years later, my company has over 50 employees and just closed a Series B funding round. I’m not Jeff Bezos, but I’ve got more money than I ever dreamed of, and more importantly, peace. Real peace.

And that’s when she messaged me.

Out of nowhere, one rainy Tuesday night, I got a DM on Instagram. “Hey… I know it’s been a long time. I’ve been thinking about you. Would love to catch up.”

I didn’t respond at first. I just stared at it. Then curiosity got the better of me, and I clicked through to her profile. Everything was public. Apparently, Nick had cheated on her with some barista and ghosted her after clearing out her savings. She had a meltdown on social media a few months earlier. She lost her job, moved back in with her parents, and had been posting vague quotes about “healing” and “being broken.”

So when she said she wanted to catch up, I knew what she meant.

I didn’t ghost her. I wanted closure.

I met her at a coffee shop. She looked… tired. Not the girl I remembered. She smiled when she saw me, like none of it had happened. Like we were just old friends catching up after a long time. She said she missed me, regretted everything, and asked if we could start over. Maybe just as friends. Or see where things go.

I told her I wished her well. I meant it. But I also told her I couldn’t go backward. That some things can’t be repaired. That trust, once shattered, doesn’t glue back together — not fully. She cried. I didn’t.

I walked away, and I swear I felt lighter than I ever had in years.

Sometimes, life gives you closure. Other times, it hands you a front-row seat to someone else’s karma. Either way, it felt like justice.

# Best Laptop privacy Screen 2025: Top Rated & Reviewed

Laptop privacy screens have become essential accessories in an increasingly digital world. These thin,protective layers attach to a laptop screen,restricting teh viewing angle so that only the user directly in front of the screen can see the content. This is particularly crucial for individuals working wiht sensitive data in public places,such as coffee shops,airports,or co-working spaces. With heightened awareness surrounding data security and privacy breaches, the demand for effective privacy solutions is continuously growing.

This article reviews some of the best laptop privacy screens available in 2025, evaluating their key features, benefits, and compatibility.

## Key Features Analysis

The best laptop privacy screens offer a blend of visual security, screen protection, and ease of use. Key factors to consider include the viewing angle, installation method, screen clarity, and durability.

**Viewing Angle:** A narrow viewing angle is the primary function of a privacy screen, limiting visibility to the user directly in front of the laptop.

Typical privacy screens narrow the viewing angle to approximately 60 degrees, meaning that anyone viewing the screen from an angle greater than 30 degrees on either side will see a darkened or obscured image. The effectiveness of a privacy screen hinges on this angle, as a wider angle compromises privacy, while a narrower angle can make it challenging for the user to view the screen comfortably. High-quality screens ensure a balance between robust privacy and a pleasant viewing experience for the user.

**Installation Method:** The installation method can vary from adhesive strips to magnetic attachments, each offering different levels of convenience and reusability.

Adhesive strips offer a secure and permanent attachment but can be difficult to remove without leaving residue. Magnetic attachments provide easy installation and removal, making them ideal for users who frequently need to switch between privacy and regular viewing. Some screens use a slide-on mounting mechanism that attaches to the laptop's bezel. The optimal installation method depends on individual preferences and usage scenarios. A high-quality adhesive will leave no residue, and magnets should be strong enough to stay attached, but not so strong that they damage the laptop screen.

**Screen Clarity:** Privacy screens must maintain acceptable screen clarity while providing privacy.

Thicker screens may impact brightness and sharpness, while thinner screens might not offer adequate privacy. Premium privacy screens utilize advanced optical technology to minimize distortion and maintain high-definition clarity for the user directly in front of the screen.Some screens also boast anti-glare coatings that further enhance visibility by reducing reflections in brightly lit environments. The clarity level is often measured by light transmission, and a good screen will have a high degree of openness.**Durability and Protection:** A privacy screen also doubles as a physical barrier, protecting the laptop screen from scratches, dust, and smudges.

Durable materials, such as acrylic or tempered glass, enhance the screen's ability to withstand daily wear and tear. Scratch-resistant coatings are also beneficial, as they help maintain the clarity and appearance of the screen over time. Some privacy screens offer added protection against blue light and UV radiation,reducing eye strain during extended use. The longevity of a privacy screen is therefore often tied to the durability of its build.

Key features of laptop privacy screens include:

* Multi-layer technology for privacy
* Blue light reduction
* Anti-glare coating
* Scratch resistance

## Core Benefits

Laptop privacy screens provide several core benefits, from enhanced data security to improved work privacy and physical screen protection.

**Enhanced Data Security:** Privacy screens are vital for safeguarding sensitive details from prying eyes in public settings.

Whether you're working on confidential documents, accessing financial accounts, or handling sensitive client data, a privacy screen effectively restricts visual access to your screen's content.this reduces the risk of visual hacking and protects your personal and professional data from unauthorized observation. By limiting the viewing angle, privacy screens ensure that only the intended user can see the information displayed on the screen.

**Improved Work Privacy:** In shared workspaces or public areas, privacy screens allow you to focus on your work without others seeing what you're doing.

This is particularly useful when dealing with confidential emails,strategic plans,or proprietary information. Privacy screens minimize distractions and increase your sense of privacy, enabling you to work more efficiently and comfortably in busy environments. Improved work privacy also translates to reduced stress and enhanced productivity.

**Physical Screen Protection:** Privacy screens provide an extra layer of protection for your laptop screen.

This can prevent scratches, smudges, and minor impacts that can occur during daily use and transportation. Protecting the screen is especially vital for laptops that are frequently moved or used in diverse environments. This protection can extend the lifespan of your laptop screen and help maintain its resale value.

**Reduced Blue Light Exposure:** Many privacy screens come with blue light filters, which help to reduce eye strain.

Extended exposure to blue light emitted by screens can lead to eye fatigue, headaches, and disrupted sleep patterns. Privacy screens with blue light filters minimize these effects,allowing you to work comfortably for longer periods without experiencing eye discomfort. This is especially beneficial for individuals who spend numerous hours in front of a laptop screen each day.

**Anti-glare properties:** Glare can make it hard to see the screen, especially in brightly light areas or outside.

Many privacy screens use a matte finish to deflect glare which improves overall visibility. This is especially useful for people who work in spaces with sunlight or bright overhead lighting. This added level of clarity will make viewing your screen much easier on your eyes and reduce the chance of a headache appearing.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about laptop privacy screens:

**Do privacy screens affect screen resolution or image quality?**
Generally, good quality privacy screens are designed to minimize any noticeable impact on screen resolution or image quality when viewed from directly in front. Though, some reduction in brightness or sharpness may occur, especially when viewed from off-angles. Premium privacy screens use advanced technology to minimize distortion and maintain high-definition clarity for the user.**Are privacy screens compatible with touch screen laptops?**
Yes, there are privacy screens specifically designed for touch screen laptops. These screens are typically thinner and more responsive to touch inputs than standard privacy screens. However,its important to check the product specifications to ensure compatibility with your specific laptop model and touch screen functionality.

**Can privacy screens be removed and reused?**
The reusability of a privacy screen depends on the installation method. Magnetic privacy screens and those using tab-based attachments can be easily removed and reused multiple times without leaving residue. Adhesive privacy screens, however, may be more difficult to remove and reuse, as the adhesive can lose its stickiness over time.

**Do privacy screens protect the laptop screen from scratches?**
Yes, privacy screens act as a protective layer that helps to shield the laptop screen from scratches, dust, and smudges. Durable materials, such as acrylic or tempered glass, enhance the screen's ability to withstand daily wear and tear. Scratch-resistant coatings are also commonly used to maintain the clarity and appearance of the screen over time. This will increase the lifespan of your laptop and ensure the screen remains pristine.

Thank fuck for that,

I already feel like an overcapacity retirement home.


Thirty seven years young,

One foot in the grave,

And the other has tendonitis,

Limping from coffee pot to charity shop,

Working to afford the privilege,

Of a severely overpriced home,

And heating the fucking thing.


The Camel's back might be broken,

But he refuses to get it checked,

Just grits his teeth so hard they crack,

And refuses a dentist too.


Sorry I get metaphorical when I'm stressed,

And I've had it up to here

With emptying the dishwasher,

And convincing people I'm capable

Of living a normal life.


If I were rich,

Or mentally well,

I might want to do it all over again,

But you only live once,

So thank fuck for that.",1,1745483122.0,WisdomWriters,0,1.0,False

Let me start by saying this: I rarely write product reviews. But after what PrimeBiome has done for me, I felt *morally obligated* to share my experience. If you're reading this, chances are you're dealing with digestive discomfort, low energy, unexplained weight gain, or just a feeling that something inside you is ""off."" I’ve been there. And if you stick with me for a few minutes, I’ll explain why PrimeBiome might be the life-changing answer you’ve been looking for – just like it was for me.

# 🚨 My Breaking Point

For years, I suffered from constant bloating, unpredictable digestion, and fatigue that made it nearly impossible to get through the day. I tried everything – cutting out gluten, dairy, caffeine… even going keto for 6 months. Nothing worked long-term. My energy levels were crashing by midday, my immune system was weak, and my skin was dull and breaking out more than ever.

Doctors told me I was “fine,” but I knew something was seriously wrong with my gut.

# 🧠 The Gut-Brain Connection (That No One Talks About)

While browsing health forums, I stumbled across a term that changed everything: **gut microbiome**. I dove into the science and discovered that the gut isn't just about digestion – it's linked to your immunity, metabolism, skin, mood, sleep, and even mental clarity.

That’s when I found **PrimeBiome**, a premium probiotic + prebiotic formula designed to restore gut health at the source. At first, I was skeptical. I had tried probiotics before – cheap ones from the drugstore that did *nothing*. But after reading through the *thousands* of glowing reviews and seeing that PrimeBiome is backed by clinical research, I decided to give it one final shot.

# 🌿 What Makes PrimeBiome Different?

Here’s what stood out to me:

✅ **Clinically-Proven Strains** – Not all probiotics are created equal. PrimeBiome uses 11 scientifically-backed strains like Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum, which have been proven to improve digestion, immunity, and mood.

✅ **20 Billion CFUs Per Serving** – Many probiotics boast big numbers, but they die before reaching your gut. PrimeBiome uses patented delayed-release capsules to ensure every single strain survives stomach acid and reaches the intestines alive.

✅ **Prebiotics for Faster Results** – This was a game-changer. Prebiotics feed the good bacteria so they multiply faster, helping you feel results in days – not weeks.

✅ **Made in the USA, GMP-Certified, and No Fillers** – 100% transparency, no junk. Just pure, potent, gut-rebuilding power.

# 🔄 My 30-Day Transformation with PrimeBiome

**Day 1–3:**  
I noticed less bloating after meals. This alone felt like a miracle.

**Day 5:**  
I woke up without that heavy, groggy feeling. My digestion was smoother. I didn’t have to run to the bathroom or feel backed up anymore.

**Day 10:**  
My energy began to stabilize. I was able to work through the afternoon slump without coffee. My skin even started clearing up.

**Day 20:**  
My cravings for sugar dramatically dropped. I felt more “in control” of my food choices and mood.

**Day 30:**  
I felt like a new person. I lost 7 pounds of bloat, my brain fog was gone, and for the first time in years, I felt *normal*. Actually, better than normal — I felt *amazing*.

# 🌟 Unexpected Benefits That Blew Me Away

✅ **Better Sleep** – I fall asleep faster and sleep deeper. No more 3 a.m. tossing and turning.  
✅ **Improved Mood** – I didn’t expect this, but my anxiety levels dropped noticeably. My mind felt clearer and calmer.  
✅ **Flatter Stomach** – Yes, I lost weight, but more importantly, I lost that ""inflated"" feeling that made me dread wearing tight clothes.  
✅ **Fewer Sick Days** – My immune system is finally holding up, even during flu season.

# 💬 What Others Are Saying

Don’t just take my word for it. PrimeBiome has over 10,000+ verified reviews with stories just like mine. Moms, professionals, athletes – all finding relief from years of gut-related issues.

And the customer service? Incredible. I had a quick question about dosage, and they replied within *hours*, not days. That’s rare these days.

# ⚖️ Is It Worth It?

Absolutely. If you’ve spent hundreds on supplements, doctor visits, or fad diets – this one bottle could save you time, money, and frustration. PrimeBiome is not just another probiotic. It’s a complete gut-health *system* built on real science.

And considering it’s cheaper than a monthly coffee habit? It’s a no-brainer.

# 🛒 Final Verdict: BUY IT

I get emotional writing this because I remember the helplessness I felt before PrimeBiome. It’s not just about digestion – it’s about getting your *life* back.

If you're tired of feeling tired, bloated, foggy, and frustrated, **this is your sign**. Don’t waste another day guessing what’s wrong. Start healing from the inside out.

I don’t usually write reviews. I’m a busy mom of three, and like most people, I’ve bought tons of products online. But when something genuinely transforms your life – and I mean truly makes a *real difference* – you owe it to the world to share. That’s exactly what the **Aqua Tower** did for us.

Let me take you back a few months.

Our family had been struggling with constant health issues – nothing *major*, but those annoying, everyday things: fatigue, dry skin, weird stomach upsets, and a general lack of energy. We thought it was just the stress of life or diet, until one day I saw a shocking report online about what’s really in tap water – heavy metals, chlorine, microplastics... I was stunned. I ran to the kitchen and stared at the glass of water on the table, suddenly unsure if I was helping or *hurting* my family by letting them drink it.

That night, I started researching water purifiers – and I discovered the **Aqua Tower**.

# Why Aqua Tower?

Out of all the water purifiers I came across, **Aqua Tower stood out like a shining star**. The features were mind-blowing:

* **7-Stage Ultra Filtration** – Not just your basic carbon filter. This baby goes ALL OUT: sediment removal, activated carbon, ion exchange, and more.
* **Removes 99.99% of Contaminants** – Lead, chlorine, bacteria, heavy metals, even pharmaceutical residues. Yes, those can end up in your water.
* **No Electricity Required** – Completely gravity-based. So eco-friendly, and perfect even during power outages.
* **Huge Capacity** – The 4-gallon tank is perfect for large families like ours.
* **Easy Maintenance** – Filters last long, and the replacement process is simple.
* **Modern, Sleek Design** – Looks great on the countertop. Not bulky or ugly like other purifiers.

I was sold. I ordered it that night.

# Unboxing & Setup – So Easy a 10-Year-Old Could Do It

When the **Aqua Tower** arrived, it was packed beautifully and securely. Every piece felt solid and high-quality. Setup took maybe 10 minutes – no tools, no plumbing, no stress. It’s literally “stack and go.” We filled the tank, waited a bit for the water to filter, and then... we took our first sip.

**OH. MY. GOD.**

This wasn’t just “clean” water – it was *delicious*. Smooth, refreshing, almost sweet. My husband – a total skeptic – raised his eyebrows and said, “Wow. This tastes amazing.” Even the kids started drinking more water on their own, which, if you’re a parent, you know is a *miracle*.

# The Real Results – What Happened Next Shocked Us

Within just two weeks, I noticed a change.

* My **morning bloating was gone**.
* My **skin cleared up** – my face literally started glowing.
* My husband, who always complained about being tired, said he felt **more energized** and focused at work.
* The kids stopped getting random stomach aches that we used to brush off.
* Even our coffee tasted better – it’s unbelievable how much difference clean water makes in *everything*.

I realized… we’d been poisoning ourselves slowly, every single day, without knowing. The **Aqua Tower didn’t just give us clean water – it gave us peace of mind, health, and happiness.**

# Cost vs. Value – A No-Brainer

Let’s talk money.

Sure, you can buy cheap filters for $30 here and there. But they barely do anything. Most don’t even touch heavy metals or microplastics. The **Aqua Tower**, on the other hand, is a **complete water purification system**. It's *worth every penny* – especially when you think about:

* No more bottled water expenses (we used to spend over $100/month!)
* Fewer doctor visits
* Better health, better hydration, better energy
* Less environmental waste

And the filters? They last **months** and cost very little to replace compared to others.

If you care even a little about your family’s well-being, this isn’t a luxury – it’s a necessity.

# The One Thing I Wish I Did Sooner...

My only regret? **Not buying this sooner.**

We wasted *years* drinking questionable tap water. If I had known the damage it was doing, I would’ve rushed to get the Aqua Tower the moment it launched.

I’ve now recommended it to my sister, my parents, and even my coworkers. Every single one of them is raving about it.

# Final Thoughts – A Must-Have in Every Home

In today’s world, where clean water is no longer a guarantee, having a trustworthy filtration system is **non-negotiable**. The **Aqua Tower** isn’t just a product – it’s a health revolution in your kitchen.

I sleep better at night knowing my kids are drinking the cleanest, purest water on Earth. And that’s something you can’t put a price on.

So if you’re reading this, wondering whether it’s worth it – let me tell you: **YES. Buy it. Right now. Don’t wait. Your body will thank you. Your family will thank you. Your future self will thank you.**

And the filters? They last **months** and cost very little to replace compared to others.

If you care even a little about your family’s well-being, this isn’t a luxury – it’s a necessity.

# The One Thing I Wish I Did Sooner...

My only regret? **Not buying this sooner.**

We wasted *years* drinking questionable tap water. If I had known the damage it was doing, I would’ve rushed to get the Aqua Tower the moment it launched.

I’ve now recommended it to my sister, my parents, and even my coworkers. Every single one of them is raving about it.

# Final Thoughts – A Must-Have in Every Home

In today’s world, where clean water is no longer a guarantee, having a trustworthy filtration system is **non-negotiable**. The **Aqua Tower** isn’t just a product – it’s a health revolution in your kitchen.

I sleep better at night knowing my kids are drinking the cleanest, purest water on Earth. And that’s something you can’t put a price on.

So if you’re reading this, wondering whether it’s worth it – let me tell you: **YES. Buy it. Right now. Don’t wait. Your body will thank you. Your family will thank you. Your future self will thank you.**

**10/10. Highly recommended. I’d give it 100 stars if I could.** 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",0,1745482751.0,aliner,1,0.5,False

Candles always give me fond memories of my Granny and picking them out with her at the store, so this has brought back some wonderful memories as well. 

Up until this point, I had only done single colors, but I decided I wanted to try to make my coffee candle look like an actual latte. I had zero idea what I was doing, but I am so pleased with the result considering this. I also learned quite a few things as well and have some new things to try for the next time.

I just want to thank you guys as well. I've been lurking here for a bit now and everyone seems so helpful and passionate about candlemaking. This seems like such a great community and I hope y'all will welcome me and my first latte candle with open arms. ",11,1745482659.0,candlemaking,3,1.0,False
