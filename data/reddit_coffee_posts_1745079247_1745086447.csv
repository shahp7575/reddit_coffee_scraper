1k32ikz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k32ikz/am_i_crazy/,Am I crazy?,"My wife has a habit of making negative comments towards me, then when I get visibly upset,  back pedals and says“I’m just kidding, OMG”. Then she gets mad at me for being cranky/grumpy/can’t take a joke to the point where it causes a fight. If I try to talk to her about it, I am “always upset and angry” at her. Maybe it’s my demeanour but she is recommending me to seek anger management due to my behaviour 

I know if I did the same thing to her she would also get upset and tell me the same things. 

I have to just agree when she says something to me. An example is today, I went to use my panini press and told her she broke one of the clips for the retaining plates when she put it away. Immediately she told me “it was you, you know how you are, always breaking things”. When she said this I got visibly upset, and she followed up with “OMG, I was just kidding”. Those were the last words she said to me in the last 2 hours.  I have since apologized for being upset and all she said was “okay” clearly unimpressed by my actions. 

So now I’m writing this from my coffee table where my wife is passive aggressively walking around the house and ignoring me. 

What do I do? Do I need to seek anger management? Do I bring this up to her and start a fight which will end up with me begging her to stay? Is this a control issue?",2,1745086266.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

So much so that I’ve been listening to it whenever I can whether it’s in the shower on my tv or in my car on the way to work, you can probably see where this is going. It was early in the morning, around 3:30AM to be exact, on the first day of December I was traveling to work in my mom’s old car that I was planning on buying off of her at some point in the future. As I’m driving I’m listening to Distractible, I think it was one of the Christmas episodes but I’m not sure which one, during the drive I’m starting to get a little sleepy so I take a sip of my coffee to wake me up a little. As I am about 5 minutes from work I close my eyes intending to blink, however my body decided it was a good idea to keep my eyes closed for longer than the average blink usually allows. Big mistake, as when I open my eyes I see myself not on the road but in the air going into a ditch, head on into a telephone pole, all the while I am hearing Markiplier talk about lenses as my life flashes before my eyes. Next thing I know I’m in a ditch and I have a telephone pole in my passenger seat all while Mark is still talking about his lenses. Thankfully I wasn’t injured too badly, just a messed up rotary cuff and shaken a little, my mom’s car though was crumpled up like a ball of aluminum foil so I wasn’t going to be driving to work any time soon. Now how does any of this relate to me finding out I have severe sleep apnea? Well after the crash my parents and I decided to go to a sleep study to see why I might have dozed off behind the wheel. Did I not get enough sleep? Do I have narcolepsy? Or was Mark’s voice so soothing that it just lulled me into a deep sleep? Turns out when I sleep I don’t breathe as much as the average person should, resulting in me feeling tired even if I sleep for 12 hours straight. So they diagnosed me with severe sleep apnea and sent me home with a CPAP machine, ever since then I’ve been getting some of the best sleep Iv’e ever had and for the first time I actually feel well rested after a long night’s sleep. So thank you Distractible for helping me figure out that I have severe sleep apnea, and all it cost was my mom’s car (thanks for that Mark).

1k32es6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1k32es6/dcf_depressed_couch_fart_safe_place_for_all_the/,"$DCF- Depressed Couch Fart. Safe place for all the rekt, rugged and emotionally bankrupt","Let’s be real. Crypto hasn’t just been a financial rollercoaster—it’s been an emotional beatdown. One day you’re up 30x, the next you’re staring at your screen, eating cold pizza, wondering why you trusted a Telegram bot with your life savings. You start your day checking charts with hope, and end it Googling, “how to explain rug pulls to your therapist.” If this sounds familiar, welcome home.

This is $DCF – Depressed Couch Fart, the most painfully honest meme coin on the blockchain. No fake utility. No roadmaps filled with buzzwords. Just a bunch of tired, rugged, depressed couch-dwellers who’ve been through it all—and decided to fart in the face of this market madness.

What the Hell is $DCF?

$DCF stands for Depressed Couch Fart. Yes, we know it sounds stupid. Yes, that’s the point. Because the market is stupid. We’re just being honest about it.

It’s a meme coin. But not just any meme coin. It’s a therapy group wrapped in a token. It’s a collective sigh from everyone who lost money on the “next 100x” project that rugged in 6 hours. It’s for the people who stayed up until 3 a.m. watching a pump, only for the dev to disappear with the liquidity before sunrise.

We’re not trying to be the next Ethereum. We’re not launching an AI-powered NFT metaverse. We’re not promising passive income. We’re promising vibes. Safe, sarcastic, slightly gassy vibes.

The Origin Story

$DCF was born on a couch. More specifically, on a stained, saggy couch, occupied by a guy who had just been rugged for the fourth time that week. Empty coffee cup. Cigarette butts. Dead chart on the screen. Hope? Gone.

In that moment of despair, something beautiful happened: A fart. Not just any fart. A depressed couch fart.

And with that sacred sound, a movement began.

We realized there are millions of us. People who got into crypto to escape the 9-to-5, and ended up with PTSD from PancakeSwap. People who aped into coins with names like “GigaMoonLaunch69” and are now too ashamed to tell their friends. People who just want a community that gets it.

So we built $DCF.

Why Join the Fart? • Honesty: No lies. No hype. Just pure, unfiltered memes and solidarity. • Safety: We’ve locked liquidity, renounced ownership, and said goodbye to scammy tactics. We don’t need them. We’re not in it for a lambo. We’re in it for the couch. • Community: Our holders are tired, hilarious, slightly broken, and completely brilliant. If you’ve been rugged, scammed, or emotionally damaged by this market, you’ll fit right in. • Therapy (kind of): We won’t fix your bags. But we will laugh with you about them. And that’s worth something.

The Tokenomics

We’re not going to sugarcoat this: We kept it simple. Because we’re tired. • 1,000,000,000 total supply • No presale • No team allocation • Liquidity locked forever • Ownership renounced • Tax: 0/0 – No weird wallet-draining tricks • Contract verified and clean

This isn’t a pump-and-dump, it’s a lie-down-and-sob.

The Mission

We’re not building a DEX. We’re not launching a DAO. We’re not solving real-world problems. We’re making a safe space for the emotionally wrecked.

This is about community. About showing up, lighting a cigarette, pouring a cold cup of coffee, and saying, “Same bro. Same.”

Whether you’re here because you got rugged, rekt, or just needed to feel something again—we welcome you. You’re one of us now. A $DCF holder. A fart in the storm. A survivor of the chaos.

The Future (Probably)

Do we have a roadmap? No.

Do we have dreams? Yes. Mostly of having enough serotonin to sit upright.

But look, if the community grows, we’re open to: • Depressed Couch Merch (hoodies, candles, beanbags, air fresheners) • DCF NFT Collection – every piece a visual cry for help • Mental health collabs – actual real-world impact • Therapy group chats (featuring $DCF memes) • A game where you just sit on the couch and press “cope”

But we’re not going to promise any of that unless it actually happens. Because we’re tired of getting lied to, and we assume you are too.

Final Words

Crypto can be lonely, brutal, and exhausting. 

You lose money, trust, and sometimes your will to keep going. But out of that pain, $DCF was born. A coin not for pumping, but for processing. Not for mooning, but for mourning. A coin that understands.

If you’ve ever muttered “I hate this market” while watching your portfolio evaporate—this coin is for you.

If you’ve ever stared blankly at a chart and thought, “What am I doing with my life?”—this coin is for you.

If you’ve ever let out a depressed fart while lying on your couch—this coin is definitely for you.

Join us. Be a part of $DCF – Depressed Couch Fart. Not to get rich. But to feel seen.

Because sometimes… the fart is the only thing real.

We started to hangout and I realised she is a very good person,kind, caring,does a lot for the people she loves and tries to help.

As the time went by she started to open up to me more and more. Before I realised she was calling me pretty much every day explaining every little detail of her problems and flirts she had. 

Now I'm the kind of person that I don't talk too much. I really try to listen to her but it got to a point that it's tiring.

I have a new job now and she calls me everyday single day. Sometimes if I don't pick up she calls again.I know she deals with a lot right now but I honestly want to chill after a long day at work and not to listen her rumbling about her problems. When we talk it's usually 90% of her talking about her self. I tried many times to talk only about me but she somehow listens for a minute or two and then she continues about herself.

The thing is I feel exhausted lately.i avoid her calls and don't feel like talking. I feel guilty. She deals with a lot right now,her mom is sick,she has a really hard time at her new job and she lately suffered a small stroke.I try to support her as I can by listening to her but I can't anymore this daily thing. 

How do I approach this situation without hurting her? Also I moved to a different country so it's not like we can meet anytime soon so our interactions are only by phone calls.

I started taking beano & lactaid with food but they don't seem to help. Gas X also doesn't help. Sometimes pepto gives me some relief but that's the only thing that semi works.

My husband is a family medicine physician and he thought I needed a PPI bc the burping is out of control. After 2 weeks of omeprazole, I got no relief from any symptoms. He is going to get me in with a GI and thinks I could potentially have an ulcer. We are going on a beach trip in less than a week so I won't be seeing a GI until after vacation. I'm worried about having a miserable trip. I was eating super healthy and feeling my best for about 3 months before this suddenly started. I ate tons of high fodmap veggies, garlic, dairy. I pretty much completely cut out alcohol too (haven't had any in 6 months besides mimosas on Christmas).

My digestion issues really hit me out of nowhere. After digging on the internet, SIBO seems to be one of the few things that correlates with my symptoms. I brought it up to my husband, and he did not know what SIBO was. He looked into and said he could write me some Rifaximin to see if helped since he doesn't think it would do any harm to try it.

People who have taken this medication: Would you start it before a trip? IF my issue is SIBO, would it give me relief during the trip? If I get an RX today, then I could start it about 6 days before the trip. Do you think it's worth a shot or am I too late to bother?

Recently may problema ako with my mental health, di ako makatulog ng mabuti, my mind is everywhere, Im confused with my feelings towards a friend, Im trying to move on from a past relationship, work, etc.. 

Kanina while having dinner with  friends, bigla akong nanginig, like uncontrolled shaking, I cant feel my body, and cant even hold the icecream Im eating. Before the incident hindi na talaga mabuti ang pakiramdam ko, I cant maintain focus and i dont understand what  im feeling. 
Matagal na tong problema, kapag stress ako sa lahat bigla akong nagpapalpitate and all, dati sinisisi ko pa sa kape kaya ako nagstop uminom, pero even after I stopped coffee nangyayari to... 
Problem is I never show/share this to others, kasi kaya ko naman i control dati, yong ngayon lang tong matindi na its really obvious. 
Ngayon, here I am again, cant sleep. Yong nangyari kanina is the side of myself I dont want others to see. Though I consider these people friends, they're pretty new in my circle, I just recently moved to a new work in a new city and these are my new found friends and they knew me as outgoing, bubbly person. Plus the fact na nandon din yong isa na I am liking and as mentioned confused sa feelings sa kanya, adds to my anxiety. I really like this person and the fact na nagkaron ako ng ""attack"" in front of him makes me more anxious na baka biglang di niya ako maintindihan and lumayo siya and all. 
Di ko na alam. I know I should focus more on myself but I dont know. 
Ang gulo ng isip ko pati yong ""attack"" ko kanina, I am questioning if its really an attack or just a mere imagination or drama ko lang.

Lunch: ham & cheese sandwiches and chips (I had another PB&J and some chips)

So far, nothing has been particularly “traditional”—just standard meals with meat/dairy. And if I hadn’t brought the stuff for sandwiches, I would’ve had basically nothing to eat today.

I’m staying from Friday to Sunday, and it really feels like they just didn’t plan to feed me at all this weekend and expected me to be fine with that.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost three years, and I’ve met all of his extended family before. The last time I was here (not for a holiday), his grandparents actually got me plant milk and even made lentils and other protein options. So… yeah. Just wanted to vent.

I'm not measuring anything yet, just eating until I'm full. But it seems like I'm eating half of what I'd planned for. 

I'm down about 10lbs. I guess water/inflammation weight. Overall I feel better and I'm sleeping less. 

A little lethargic, I think that's mostly due to going from hundreds of carbs/sugar per day to like 3. I get cravings for my old carb-snacks from time to time, but not actually being hungry. 

Yesterday a ribeye lasted all day with leftovers. 

I haven't eaten any eggs yet because of my lack of hunger. I'm thinking about making keto deviled eggs this weekend. That sounds like something different. 

I guess so far things are successful. I need to make sure my body adapts from carbs to fat and I dial into the right ratios. And I know I need to be concerned how coke zero is going to throw things off and might prevent or make ketosis more difficult.

1k325ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/WellbeingHypnotherapy/comments/1k325ks/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts – just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let’s clear up a misconception: introversion doesn’t mean we’re anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren’t overwhelming.

Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished – unable to pass on their genes.) That’s one of the factors why we’re here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring—it’s exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It’s a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.

 

**Signs You’re an Introvert with Anxiety—which ones do you relate to the most?**

1. You Typically Overprepare

You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control—but it can also be draining.

Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‘’best case scenario’’ – luck isn’t a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn’t stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.

 

2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic

Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active—sometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.

Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won’t be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‘From Limitations to Liberation’ – it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs.

 

3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy

Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it’s a high energy ‘state’ – one of the reasons it can be so tiring)—constantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.

Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‘what is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?’

 

4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan

Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets – sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.

Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new café. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‘programmed’ by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‘programming’ new avenues of opportunity open up for us. 

 

5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask

You’ve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not taking a toll internally.

Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it’s just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.

 

6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations

Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options – see my article ‘Live the life you choose – expand your Thought-Action Repertoire’), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.

Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you’re anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event—like having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.

 

7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing

Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like “I need everyone to like me to be valuable” create intense anxiety around how you’re perceived.

Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‘them’?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you’re not responsible for everyone else’s happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.

 

8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker

Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.

Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it’s not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.

 

9. Trouble Sleeping

Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.

Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it’s time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‘lights out’ time – read until your eyes close and your head nods.

 

**Moving From Awareness to Action**

Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it’s also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You’re not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself—there’s strength in softness.

 

**Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert**

 

1.      Create and Protect Your Recharge Time

For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it’s 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you—it’s a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.

 

2.      Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions

We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.

 

3.      Prepare and Plan for Social Situations

One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn’t mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don’t even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.

 

4.      Create a Space at Home that Grounds You

Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed—this could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.

 

5.      Harness Your Listening Superpower

Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen—this not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.

 

So, ask yourself: What is one thing from this article that resonates most with you? What small action can you take today to start navigating your life in a healthier way?

And what are your own go to strategies?

They used to tell Riley, “Dream big.”
But every time he did, someone nearby had a needle — ready to pop it.

At home, dreaming wasn’t hope.  
It was disobedience.

""You need to make us proud,"" his dad would say —  
once every few months, like it still meant something.  
The same man who dipped when Riley couldn’t even tie his shoes…  
now acting like he had a say in who Riley became.

His mom would hand him the phone like it burned her fingers.  
""Talk to your father.""  
Like it was Riley’s job to fix something he didn’t break.  
Like a two-minute call could patch up a lifetime of silence.

Then came the family —  
those side-character relatives who only showed up to compare him to someone else.

""Your cousin just got into engineering.""  
""Did you hear David got a full scholarship?""  
""You should try that too.""

He hated those gatherings.  
Fake smiles. Stale cake.  
And those loaded questions:

""So, what do you wanna be?""

He used to say ""artist.""  
Said it with pride once.  
Now he just shrugs.

Because the last time he said it, the room froze —  
like he’d said *failure.*

""You’re wasting your life,"" someone whispered.  
And no one disagreed.

His mom?  
She didn’t back him up.  
Just stared at her coffee like it might offer an escape.  
Or maybe she agreed with them.  
Maybe she was tired too — tired of defending a son who never quite fit the mold.

Comparison became tradition.  
He walked into rooms and felt like a walking letdown.  
Didn’t matter what he did —  
it wasn’t *that*.  
It wasn’t *them.*

He used to draw to feel something.  
One time, he showed a portrait to his uncle — a soft pencil sketch, full of detail.  
The guy chuckled.

""Cool hobby. But what’s your real plan?""

Riley just nodded and walked off.  
Didn’t bother explaining.  
Not worth the breath.

After that, he kept his art to himself.  
Closed the sketchbook.  
Closed himself.

Because in that house, silence hurt less than trying.

And the scariest part?  
He started believing them.

Started hearing their voices when he looked in the mirror:  
lazy, lost, disappointing.

He wasn’t.

But when you’re constantly told you’re not enough,  
you stop dreaming.  
Not because you quit —  
but because you never got the space to even begin.

I got my younger sister a laptop a few years ago for college.  Nothing too fancy, midrange HP laptop with integrated graphics.  She got kicked out of the university her first year and fired from her first job because she was playing video games instead of going to class.  After that she stayed with my grandparents for the summer and got kicked out of there.  Then moved to my older sister's place and got kicked out of there too.  My younger sister never had a stable childhood.  My mom and stepdad moved like 4-5 times to different states as house flippers when she was growing up  By that time, us 3 older siblings we're already 18+ and living on our own but we works only visit a few times a year.

Youngest got kicked out of my older sister's house because she lied about going to school and work.  She was always late to get job 5 minutes away.  The last straw was instead of going to class at a community college, she would go to a coffee shop and play games.  My older sister found that out and gave her 3 months to move out.

At the end of the 3 months, my younger sister admitted herself to the psych ward for a few weeks.  After that, she refused to go back home so my mom flew up for a couple weeks to apartment search.  They found one and my mom paid for the first month rent of an apartment, with the promise that my younger sister would pay her own way after that.  My mom also pays for her cell phone and car insurance.  You guessed it, my younger sister didn't pay for anything so my mom footed thousands and thousands of dollars in paying for her rent and bills.  Younger sister admitted herself to the psych ward a couple more times and even tried to kill herself by driving until she ran out of gas and drove into a farmer's field.  The farmer found her and the ambulance took her to another psych ward.  After she got out, my mom and stepdad went to go pick her and the car up with the intention of bringing her back.  They paid to fix the car and rented a uhaul but as they were cleaning and packing up my sister's extremely dirty apartment, she had a breakdown and screamed at my mom and stepdad.  Avoiding wanting any more conflicts, my mom and stepdad decided to just leave and drove the 10 hours back home to Oklahoma.  That was last September.  My younger sister won't respond back to any calls or texts from any of us except when my mom leaves her a message that she's going to take her off the insurance and phone if she doesn't respond.

Fast forward to now, my younger sister has now moved back with my mom and stepdad for month.  My mom had to pay $5k to the apartment complex for late fees (can't evict tenants during the winter in Minnesota).  They expected her to find a job at least and while my sister agreed, it was all empty agreements.  She's still not doing anything productive and just plays games all day with no job.

Another thing to note, she lost her full ride scholarship to the university and blew away over $60k in child support/college fund in video games; stupid shit like Apex Legend skins or door dash or buying shit for her friends but being stingy when my older sister asked her to pay for food.

I'm tempted to just break the laptop that I gave her for school so she can't play video games.  I know my mom would never make her pay rent or kick her out, that's not the type of person my mom is.  Restricting the wifi won't work since she'll just leave to go play at a coffee shop like before.

When she comes out of the psych ward, she acts all cherry and normal like nothing happened, but then falls back into only playing video games.  It's turning into a cycle.

#  What It Does

* **Video editing:** trim, merge, convert, stabilize, apply filters
* **Audio editing:** trim, convert, enhance (noise reduction, normalization)
* **Image editing:** resize, compress, format‑convert, AI‑style transfer, EXIF tools
* **AI‑powered tools:** auto‑enhancements, style transfers, smart suggestions
* **YouTube integration:** browse & download (Following Youtube TOS)
* **Slideshow maker:** batch images → quick video with transitions



Most core features already work—just a few rough edges left to polish. The Ai for v1 does not work.



# My ScrewUp....aka Not paying attention. 

A couple of sleepless nights ago, I was  debugging  when I **accidentally deleted the entire Models/ folder thinking its the AiModels(which i was trying to fix)**.  Apple’s deletion is permanent, and no recovery tool could undo it ( i tried a lot). Two days later, I finally gave up on restoration. Now I have to rebuild every single CoreML model , which will take **way** more time than I anticipated—especially since my last Time Machine backup was back in March.

**Lessons learned:**

* Get sleep 
* Turn on Time Machine 
* Make backups…more backups and even more backup always

 **What’s Next**

* **Release v1**: I’m putting out the last working build today, bugs and all.

1k31ss2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1k31ss2/does_baby_jogger_city_mini_gt_travel_system_live/,Does Baby Jogger City Mini GT Travel System Live Up to Its 4.8 Rating?,"The Baby Jogger 1969679 City Mini GT Travel System, Black has been an absolute staple in my daily outings with a little one. Having tested it extensively, from park strolls to quick car seat installations, I feel pretty confident sharing my perspective. It’s more than just a stroller—it’s an entire travel solution bundled into an impressively sleek and functional package.

The travel system pairs the City Mini GT stroller with the City Go infant car seat. What struck me first was how effortlessly the infant car seat installed both with and without its base. Heading to a friend’s house in a taxi? No problem; the taxi-safe belt path is a lifesaver for quick installations. Whether clipped into its base in your personal car or secured directly, setup takes seconds, which is crucial when juggling bags, bottles, and a cranky baby. 

**Winning Points**

- The fold mechanism is worth raving about. You simply lift a strap, and the stroller folds itself. This one-handed magic makes tackling stairs, buses, or even tight storage situations a breeze.
- All-terrain wheels glide smoothly over uneven sidewalks, parks, and grocery store carpets with equal ease. It doesn’t matter if it's a gravel path or a cracked curb—this thing keeps rolling.
- The UV 50+ rated sun canopy with a peek-a-boo window is a thoughtful addition, shielding your baby on sunny days and letting you peek in without causing any unnecessary disturbance.
- Compact size and lightweight design make it easy to carry or maneuver, even one-handed, while wrangling a toddler or holding a coffee. (Yes, I somehow still need my caffeine.)
- Comes with everything you need: stroller, car seat, and adapters—no extra purchases necessary.

[Check Baby Jogger 1969679 price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b01fyc6qv0/)

At first, I was skeptical about how “compact” it would actually be. Thankfully, the lightweight aluminum frame handles beautifully, and the automatic locking mechanism after the fold felt secure enough to toss into a trunk. The under-seat basket is spacious compared to others I’ve used. It holds most of the toddler essentials—think diaper bag, snacks, maybe even my jacket on colder days. The storage is big and accessible but doesn’t bulge awkwardly, which keeps the stroller’s profile sleek.  

Adding to its versatility, the harness system deserves a shout-out. It’s adjustable and fits snugly but comfortably around a growing baby. The 5-point design offers peace of mind while ensuring the squishiest escape artists won’t wriggle free. I took this stroller to everything from casual mall strolls to outdoor festivals, and my small passenger was happy and supported every time.

**Areas for Improvement**

- While the stroller functions extremely well, it isn’t suitable for jogging or running. This may be disappointing for parents looking for an all-in-one stroller that supports more fitness-oriented activities.
- The overall weight, while fine for general use, feels a bit hefty when dealing with stairs or lifting into taller vehicles.
- Hand-operated brakes are efficient but could have been smoother with a bit more refinement in design.
- Taller parents (above 6ft) may find the handlebar, even at its tallest adjustment, slightly uncomfortable for extended periods of use. 

When directly compared to other travel systems, like the Graco Modes Travel System or Chicco Bravo Trio, there are some key differences to highlight. The all-terrain wheels on the City Mini GT are a game-changer that outclass the typical plastic wheels found on cheaper models, offering a smoother ride over bumpy terrains. However, the Chicco Bravo does feature a more cushioning seat for infants. Similarly, while the Graco Modes comes with additional bassinet conversion, it lacks the compact fold convenience of the City Mini GT. I found the Baby Jogger system most efficient for city settings, where portability and ease of use matter most, even if it sacrifices some extras like bulkier padding.

**Worth Every Penny**

There’s no denying the travel system leans on the pricier side, but the combination of convenience, durability, and versatility justifies the investment for many. When compared against similarly featured competitors, this product delivers a level of ease and functionality that feels well-calibrated to the needs of active parents. It’s not cheap but doesn’t feel overpriced given its specs and build quality. The premium features like the quick fold mechanism, quality of the car seat integration, and the sun canopy significantly elevate its value. If you often juggle city or suburban environments and want a system that’s reliable, stylish, and functional, this might be your pick.

**A Jewel**: Easter is tomorrow. It means a great deal to me because Father God left his residence to come into ours and meet us where we are. He took our shame, our guilt, our discouragement and lack of understanding and he wrapped it all up and brought it with him to the cross. Then, he left it all there when he died. Soon, he took off those death garments, had an angel open the door to His grave and walked out victoriously. Death carried no threat to Him. As a matter of fact, nothing can stand against him. We are his children and nothing can stand against us! He did it all for you and for me.

**Gem:** This morning I woke and read in bed with my morning coffee. I was learning about the kingdom of God — which is here on earth with his family (us!). It was such a beautiful start to my day. Then, I made these beautiful carrot, date, pecan muffins with a cream cheese and orange zest glaze. What a magnificent day!

**Metaphorical Gunpowder**: Shame shrouded my being for years upon years. It showed up in the people I hung around, the husband I lived with who brutally abused me and my children, and all the bad treatment I allowed. Not so today! Oh, I hear the ugly voice of my accuser but I fight to silence that voice now. It’s not who I am any more.

I’ve also just had two cups of coffee and so my thoughts might be scattered lol. 

I’m in my mid twenties, talking to a man 44 years older than me and as I consider moving forward with him, I’ve reflected on my past and realized a few things: In general I’m open to unconventional things, in both accepting and rebellious ways. This likely comes from my background. I was raised in a sheltered home (I think that can speak for itself). Also, my sensitive nature as a child gave my family more trouble than they probably either anticipated or knew how to deal with so it felt my siblings were naturally given more adoration and respect. Though unaddressed (directly at least), it made me feel unseen — this mixed with not having a father present my entire life, giving me what you can consider “daddy issues” — I’m not very surprised I’m considering moving out of state with a man 44 years older. There’s a lot of things that draw me to older men in ways I just don’t know I could feel from a man younger, or maybe I just haven’t experienced it yet.

But Im grappling how to reconcile with this. I’ve never really fantasized about marriage or kids… :/  But Ive fantasized about what my house would look like, and especially about older men. While my sister was obsessed with one direction, I was obsessed with Michael Jackson… and so forth. Is this something to fix or is it something to accept? Is my fate to be with a much older man, despite the taboo nature of what that it would entail? My family wouldn’t be for it, so there’s a lot to consider about something like this and I just need to express this somewhere. If you read this thank you for letting me share with you.

I'm standing in a Loew's Home Improvement store in front of the ""neutrals"" paint chips, huffing rubber cement to get high, and I am just...lost. (I got glue all over the Lexus key opening the can. That car is too big. It's just...that car is too big.) I have every single one of these colors painted in big squares all over the walls of the living room. And the bedroom. And both bathrooms and the hallway. I still can't decide. The only color we could decide on was the dining room and so we painted that. And then wallpapered over it. And then painted over that. With a trompe l'oeil mural of avocados. I hate it. He loves it. I hate it. (I'm not saying anything. It's done. It's over.) I have NO idea where the kids are. It's been like two days.

\[Srsly tho, guys, that color you actually picked last time (Accessable Blech) is just. plain. horrible. It's like the color of life leaving the body. Just GHASTLY. Guh. Like imagine one of those 'all painted white shitholes' painted in that color...like the one where they were all like 'I got a green blanket!' and it's like Charcoal Green ffs. Imagine THAT room painted THAT color. I bet if you put me in that room I would actually, literally DIE of it...from like, *soul* *poisoning*. ...I read a thing about Mars one time that said that, under ideal conditions (like summer, bottom of the Valles Marineris, high pressure front in...), you could survive, gasping, for about 74 minutes (why do I remember that number even?), until you suffocated in the CO2 with your eyballs popping. Like THAT. It would be like that. That color is like someone riding by on a bicycle shouting the n-word at the person you're talking to. That bad. Truly truly truly a soul-sucking shade...way to go guys. Nasty.\]",7,1745083342.0,homedecoratingCJ,3,1.0,False

1k31de9,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1k31de9/musician/,MUSICIAN,"The crystal glass in my hand felt heavy, the cut facets catching the soft glow of the city lights filtering through the panoramic window. It held a ruby-red Cabernet Sauvignon, a vintage I wouldn't have dared to dream of a year ago. Now, it was just… there. Like the sprawling apartment that swallowed my old life whole, or the hushed reverence in the eyes of strangers.

My phone lay on the plush velvet cushion beside me, its screen a swirling vortex of opinions, accolades, and outright venom. I’d told myself I wouldn't look. I’d promised Sarah, my fiercely protective manager, that I’d spend this rare quiet evening unwinding, maybe even attempting a coherent thought that wasn’t a lyric or a chord progression. But the siren call of the digital world, the validation and the vitriol, was too strong to resist.

With a sigh that tasted of exhaustion and something akin to disbelief, I picked it up. The first headline screamed in bold, digital ink: “Luna Reigns Supreme! ‘Starlight Symphony’ Shatters Records, Cementing Her Status as Music’s New Queen.” A small, weary smile touched my lips. Luna. That was me. Or rather, the me the world now knew. My real name, Elara Vance, felt like a ghost, a whisper from a life that was rapidly fading into memory.

I scrolled down, the comments blurring into a relentless stream. “Her voice is angelic! Pure talent.” “Those high notes give me chills every time.” “Finally, a real artist in a sea of manufactured pop.” These were the ones Sarah diligently screenshotted and sent with heart emojis. They were the fuel that kept the engine of ‘Luna’ running, the affirmation that all the years of dingy bars, open mic nights, and ramen noodle dinners hadn’t been in vain.

Then came the other side of the coin, the sharp edges of public scrutiny that sliced through the carefully constructed facade of stardom. “She’s only popular because she’s pretty. Another industry plant.” “Her lyrics are shallow. Where’s the depth?” “Look at her, all dolled up. Bet she’s nothing like her ‘authentic’ image.” These comments, often hidden behind anonymous avatars, stung with a peculiar intensity. They targeted not just my music, but me, the person beneath the layers of makeup and designer clothes.

And then there were the ones that delved deeper, the invasive probes into the territory of my personal life. “Is she still with Liam? Haven’t seen them together lately.” “Heard she’s been getting close to that actor from the music video.” “Her body looks amazing! What’s her workout routine?” These felt like a violation, a public dissection of something that should have remained private. Liam. My Liam. My anchor in the storm that my life had become. The comments about us were a constant, nagging worry. The relentless pressure of my sudden fame had cast a long shadow over our relationship, stretching it thin.

I took a long sip of the wine, the rich liquid doing little to soothe the knot in my stomach. It had all happened so fast. One moment, I was Elara, a struggling musician pouring her heart out in dimly lit venues for a handful of indifferent patrons. The next, ‘Starlight Symphony’ exploded. A melody I’d hummed to myself during a particularly lonely night, lyrics born from a yearning for connection, had somehow resonated with millions.

The song was everywhere. Radio stations played it on repeat. It dominated every streaming chart. My face, once familiar only to my closest friends and family, was plastered on billboards and magazine covers. Suddenly, I was Luna, the voice that everyone seemed to know, the face that everyone had an opinion on.

The whirlwind that followed was a blur of interviews, photoshoots, and performances. I went from playing to rooms of fifty people to stadiums filled with tens of thousands, their faces a sea of glowing phone screens and ecstatic expressions. The energy was intoxicating, the roar of the crowd a validation that sent shivers down my spine. But it was also isolating. Surrounded by a team of managers, publicists, and assistants, I often felt like the only one who remembered the quiet girl with a guitar and a dream.

Liam had been there from the beginning. He’d carried my equipment, cheered the loudest at my gigs, and patiently listened to countless iterations of half-finished songs. He was my rock, my constant in a world that was suddenly spinning wildly out of control. But the distance, both physical and emotional, was growing. My schedule was relentless, taking me to different cities, different countries, for weeks at a time. When I did manage to snatch a few precious hours at home, I was often too exhausted to be fully present.

The comments about other men, the insinuations of fleeting connections, were like tiny daggers, twisting in the wound of my guilt and insecurity. The truth was, the attention from others was overwhelming, sometimes even predatory. But Liam and I had always been so solid, our bond built on years of shared dreams and quiet understanding. Could this sudden shift in my reality truly erode something so strong?

I scrolled further, my thumb hovering over a particularly nasty comment about my weight. It was a familiar sting. Even before the fame, I’d battled with body image issues, the relentless pressure to conform to an impossible ideal. Now, under the harsh glare of the public eye, every perceived flaw was magnified, dissected, and judged.

The irony wasn’t lost on me. I’d poured my soul into my music, crafting melodies and lyrics that I hoped would touch people, would make them feel something. And yet, so much of the public discourse revolved around my appearance, my clothes, my perceived desirability. It felt like my art, the very essence of who I was, was being overshadowed by the superficial.

There were times, in the quiet solitude of hotel rooms or during long flights, when I wondered if it was all worth it. The constant scrutiny, the loss of privacy, the gnawing fear that I would somehow disappoint everyone – the fans, my team, Liam, myself. The weight of expectation felt immense, a crushing burden that threatened to suffocate the joy I had once found in creating music.

But then, a different kind of comment would catch my eye. “Your music helped me through a really tough time. Thank you, Luna.” “Starlight Symphony’ is our anthem! It reminds us that there’s always hope.” These messages, raw and heartfelt, were like a lifeline. They reminded me of the reason I had started this journey in the first place – the desire to connect, to share something meaningful with the world.

I remembered the small, dimly lit bar where I’d first played ‘Starlight Symphony’. The handful of people in the audience had been polite, their applause perfunctory. I’d almost given up on the song, convinced it was too sentimental, too vulnerable. But Liam had encouraged me, his belief in my music unwavering.

And then, that one night, a small independent blogger had been in the audience. She’d written a glowing review, praising the song’s raw emotion and my voice. That review had been the first domino, leading to a viral surge of interest, a record label deal, and ultimately, this dizzying, overwhelming reality.

The success of ‘Starlight Symphony’ felt both like a dream come true and a surreal out-of-body experience. I was living a life I had only ever fantasized about, yet a part of me felt disconnected, like I was watching it all unfold from behind a pane of glass.

The pressure to follow up with another hit was immense. My label was eager for a new album, my fans were clamoring for more music, and the fear of becoming a one-hit wonder loomed large. Every melody I wrote, every lyric I penned, was now scrutinized with a critical eye, the bar set impossibly high by the runaway success of my debut single.

I missed the anonymity of my old life, the simple pleasures of walking down the street without being recognized, of having conversations that weren’t dissected and analyzed by strangers. I missed the easy camaraderie of my musician friends, the shared struggles and triumphs that had forged a bond between us. Now, there was a distance, a subtle shift in their demeanor, a mixture of pride and perhaps a touch of envy.

Liam’s silence in the face of the online speculation was both a comfort and a source of anxiety. He wasn’t one for dramatic outbursts or public displays of emotion. His support had always been quiet and steadfast. But the lack of direct conversation about the rumors, the unspoken tension that sometimes hung in the air between us, was unsettling.

I knew I needed to talk to him, to bridge the growing gap that my new life had created. But the words often felt inadequate, the explanations hollow. How could I possibly convey the strange duality of feeling both incredibly successful and profoundly lost?

The comments about my body were a constant trigger. I’d always been self-conscious, but the relentless scrutiny of millions amplified those insecurities tenfold. Every outfit I wore, every photo that was taken, was analyzed for any perceived flaw. The pressure to maintain a perfect image was exhausting, a constant battle against my own natural imperfections.

I’d started working with a trainer, not because I particularly enjoyed grueling workouts, but because I felt like I had to. The comments, the subtle (and not-so-subtle) suggestions from my team, had chipped away at my self-acceptance. I wanted to be judged for my music, not my waistline.

As the night wore on, the city lights outside twinkled like distant stars, mirroring the digital constellations on my phone screen. I scrolled through more comments, the good and the bad swirling together in a dizzying vortex. It was a strange kind of intimacy, this connection with millions of strangers who felt entitled to an opinion on every aspect of my life.

I knew I couldn’t let the negativity consume me. I had to find a way to navigate this new reality, to hold onto the core of who I was amidst the chaos. My music was still my anchor, the one true thing that felt entirely mine.

With a newfound resolve, I closed the social media apps and placed my phone face down on the table. The silence in the apartment felt heavy, but also strangely liberating. I picked up the glass of wine again, the ruby liquid catching the light.

Tomorrow, there would be more interviews, more photoshoots, more demands on my time and energy. But tonight, in the quiet of my living room, I was just Elara again, a girl with a song in her heart and a story to tell. The journey was far from over, and the path ahead was uncertain. But for now, in this moment of quiet reflection, I allowed myself to simply be. The weight of the world could wait until morning. The music, however, would always be there, waiting to be heard. And that, I realized, was all that truly mattered.

The silence after putting down my phone was a fragile thing, easily shattered by the ghosts of the words I’d just read. My thumb still tingled with the phantom vibrations of scrolling, the endless feed of validation and vitriol. I took another sip of the Cabernet, the taste suddenly bitter on my tongue.

It wasn’t just the broad strokes of opinion that lingered. It was the specifics, the little barbs that burrowed under my skin and festered. Like the Motify (the sheer audacity of that name, a blatant rip-off of Spotify, yet somehow equally ubiquitous) notification that had popped up earlier, boasting a ludicrous increase in my monthly listeners. Millions. A number so vast it felt abstract, detached from the reality of me sitting here, grappling with the human cost of that very success.

And then there were the harmful clucks – the Twitter parody that had become a breeding ground for the most vile and unfounded accusations. I’d foolishly ventured onto it earlier, a morbid curiosity pulling me into the digital muck. One, in particular, had made my stomach churn: “Heard Luna’s ‘starlight’ came from spending nights with the label exec. Talentless hack riding on her back.” Another, equally poisonous: “Bet she’s got a casting couch in her studio. No way that voice is natural.”

A bitter laugh escaped my lips, echoing in the cavernous living room. Casting couch? I’d spent more nights sleeping on friends’ lumpy sofas than any executive’s anything. My studio was a cramped, soundproofed box in a less-than-glamorous part of town until about six months ago. The sheer audacity of these accusations, hurled by faceless strangers who knew nothing of the years of struggle, the sacrifices made, the sheer bloody hard work that had gone into every note, every lyric.

I rose from the plush sofa and walked to the window, the city lights blurring through the unshed tears that pricked at my eyes. “It’s a funny thing, isn’t it?” I murmured to the glass, my voice barely a whisper in the vast space. “You pour your heart and soul into something, you bleed onto the page, you hone your craft until your fingers ache and your voice is raw. You face rejection after rejection, you play to empty rooms, you eat instant noodles for weeks on end because that’s all you can afford. And then, finally, finally, something clicks. The world listens. They applaud. They call you ‘queen,’ ‘angel,’ ‘genius.’ And for a fleeting moment, you think, ‘Yes. It was worth it. All of it.’”

I turned away from the window, the reflection of my own weary face staring back at me. “But then… then the whispers start. The doubts creep in, amplified by a million anonymous voices. They don’t see the years of dedication. They don’t hear the cracked notes and the hesitant melodies of the early days. They don’t know the fear and the vulnerability that comes with sharing your innermost self with the world. No, they see a pretty face, a catchy tune, and they immediately look for the shortcut, the scandal, the easy explanation for your success that has nothing to do with the actual work.”

My fists clenched at my sides. “They dissect your body, they scrutinize your relationships, they invent tawdry narratives to explain away your achievements. They reduce years of passion and perseverance to a single, salacious rumour. And the worst part? The sheer, casual cruelty of it all. The way they type out these hateful things, hidden behind their screens, with no thought to the real person on the receiving end. It’s like throwing stones at a shadow, oblivious to the fact that the shadow belongs to someone who bleeds.”

The weight of it all settled back on my shoulders, heavy and suffocating. The irony wasn’t lost on me. I’d written a song about finding light in the darkness, about the power of connection and hope. And yet, the very platform that had catapulted that message to the world was also a breeding ground for so much darkness and disconnection.

I walked back to the coffee table, the empty wine glass a silent testament to the turbulent thoughts swirling in my head. The digital noise still echoed in the silence of the room, a phantom chorus of praise and condemnation. It was a constant battle to remember who I was beneath the layers of public perception, to hold onto the fragile core of Elara Vance in the overwhelming storm of Luna’s fame.

With a sigh that held a hint of weary resignation, I reached for the decanter. The rich, ruby liquid gurgled as it filled the glass once more. “Well,” I muttered to the empty room, a wry smile playing on my lips, “if they’re going to write dramatic narratives about my life, they might as well have a consistent prop.” And with that, Luna, or rather Elara, raised her refilled glass in a silent, slightly tipsy toast to the absurdity of it all. The online bullies could cluck and sneer, but at least she had a decent vintage to sip while they did.

Once you've chosen your ideal stroller hook, here are a few tips to ensure proper installation and usage:

*   **Follow the Manufacturer's Instructions:** Always refer to the product instructions for specific installation guidelines.

## Keeping It Safe: Important Safety Considerations

While a stroller hook can be a lifesaver, it's crucial to prioritize safety. Keep these points in mind:

*   **Never Hang Heavy Items on the Handlebar Alone:** Most stroller manufacturers advise against hanging heavy items directly on the handlebar, as this can compromise the stroller's stability and cause it to tip over, especially when the child is not in the seat.*   **Supervise Your Child:** Never leave your child unattended in a stroller, especially with added weight hanging from the stroller hook.
*   **Be Careful on Inclines:** When navigating hills or slopes, be extra cautious about the stroller's balance. Consider removing some items from the stroller hook to prevent tipping.
*   **Use with Caution on Uneven Terrain:** Bumpy sidewalks and uneven terrain can cause bags to swing and potentially dislodge from the stroller hook.
*   **Avoid Hanging Sharp or Risky objects:** Don't use the stroller hook to hang sharp objects or anything that could pose a safety hazard to your child or others.

It held a ruby-red Cabernet Sauvignon, a vintage I wouldn't have dared to dream of a year ago. Now, it was just… there. Like the sprawling apartment that swallowed my old life whole, or the hushed reverence in the eyes of strangers.

My phone lay on the plush velvet cushion beside me, its screen a swirling vortex of opinions, accolades, and outright venom. I’d told myself I wouldn't look. I’d promised Sarah, my fiercely protective manager, that I’d spend this rare quiet evening unwinding, maybe even attempting a coherent thought that wasn’t a lyric or a chord progression. But the siren call of the digital world, the validation and the vitriol, was too strong to resist.

With a sigh that tasted of exhaustion and something akin to disbelief, I picked it up. The first headline screamed in bold, digital ink: “Luna Reigns Supreme! ‘Starlight Symphony’ Shatters Records, Cementing Her Status as Music’s New Queen.” A small, weary smile touched my lips. Luna. That was me. Or rather, the me the world now knew. My real name, Elara Vance, felt like a ghost, a whisper from a life that was rapidly fading into memory.

I scrolled down, the comments blurring into a relentless stream. “Her voice is angelic! Pure talent.” “Those high notes give me chills every time.” “Finally, a real artist in a sea of manufactured pop.” These were the ones Sarah diligently screenshotted and sent with heart emojis. They were the fuel that kept the engine of ‘Luna’ running, the affirmation that all the years of dingy bars, open mic nights, and ramen noodle dinners hadn’t been in vain.

Then came the other side of the coin, the sharp edges of public scrutiny that sliced through the carefully constructed facade of stardom. “She’s only popular because she’s pretty. Another industry plant.” “Her lyrics are shallow. Where’s the depth?” “Look at her, all dolled up. Bet she’s nothing like her ‘authentic’ image.” These comments, often hidden behind anonymous avatars, stung with a peculiar intensity. They targeted not just my music, but me, the person beneath the layers of makeup and designer clothes.

And then there were the ones that delved deeper, the invasive probes into the territory of my personal life. “Is she still with Liam? Haven’t seen them together lately.” “Heard she’s been getting close to that actor from the music video.” “Her body looks amazing! What’s her workout routine?” These felt like a violation, a public dissection of something that should have remained private. Liam. My Liam. My anchor in the storm that my life had become. The comments about us were a constant, nagging worry. The relentless pressure of my sudden fame had cast a long shadow over our relationship, stretching it thin.

I took a long sip of the wine, the rich liquid doing little to soothe the knot in my stomach. It had all happened so fast. One moment, I was Elara, a struggling musician pouring her heart out in dimly lit venues for a handful of indifferent patrons. The next, ‘Starlight Symphony’ exploded. A melody I’d hummed to myself during a particularly lonely night, lyrics born from a yearning for connection, had somehow resonated with millions.

The song was everywhere. Radio stations played it on repeat. It dominated every streaming chart. My face, once familiar only to my closest friends and family, was plastered on billboards and magazine covers. Suddenly, I was Luna, the voice that everyone seemed to know, the face that everyone had an opinion on.

The whirlwind that followed was a blur of interviews, photoshoots, and performances. I went from playing to rooms of fifty people to stadiums filled with tens of thousands, their faces a sea of glowing phone screens and ecstatic expressions. The energy was intoxicating, the roar of the crowd a validation that sent shivers down my spine. But it was also isolating. Surrounded by a team of managers, publicists, and assistants, I often felt like the only one who remembered the quiet girl with a guitar and a dream.

Liam had been there from the beginning. He’d carried my equipment, cheered the loudest at my gigs, and patiently listened to countless iterations of half-finished songs. He was my rock, my constant in a world that was suddenly spinning wildly out of control. But the distance, both physical and emotional, was growing. My schedule was relentless, taking me to different cities, different countries, for weeks at a time. When I did manage to snatch a few precious hours at home, I was often too exhausted to be fully present.

The comments about other men, the insinuations of fleeting connections, were like tiny daggers, twisting in the wound of my guilt and insecurity. The truth was, the attention from others was overwhelming, sometimes even predatory. But Liam and I had always been so solid, our bond built on years of shared dreams and quiet understanding. Could this sudden shift in my reality truly erode something so strong?

I scrolled further, my thumb hovering over a particularly nasty comment about my weight. It was a familiar sting. Even before the fame, I’d battled with body image issues, the relentless pressure to conform to an impossible ideal. Now, under the harsh glare of the public eye, every perceived flaw was magnified, dissected, and judged.

The irony wasn’t lost on me. I’d poured my soul into my music, crafting melodies and lyrics that I hoped would touch people, would make them feel something. And yet, so much of the public discourse revolved around my appearance, my clothes, my perceived desirability. It felt like my art, the very essence of who I was, was being overshadowed by the superficial.

There were times, in the quiet solitude of hotel rooms or during long flights, when I wondered if it was all worth it. The constant scrutiny, the loss of privacy, the gnawing fear that I would somehow disappoint everyone – the fans, my team, Liam, myself. The weight of expectation felt immense, a crushing burden that threatened to suffocate the joy I had once found in creating music.

But then, a different kind of comment would catch my eye. “Your music helped me through a really tough time. Thank you, Luna.” “Starlight Symphony’ is our anthem! It reminds us that there’s always hope.” These messages, raw and heartfelt, were like a lifeline. They reminded me of the reason I had started this journey in the first place – the desire to connect, to share something meaningful with the world.

I remembered the small, dimly lit bar where I’d first played ‘Starlight Symphony’. The handful of people in the audience had been polite, their applause perfunctory. I’d almost given up on the song, convinced it was too sentimental, too vulnerable. But Liam had encouraged me, his belief in my music unwavering.

And then, that one night, a small independent blogger had been in the audience. She’d written a glowing review, praising the song’s raw emotion and my voice. That review had been the first domino, leading to a viral surge of interest, a record label deal, and ultimately, this dizzying, overwhelming reality.

The success of ‘Starlight Symphony’ felt both like a dream come true and a surreal out-of-body experience. I was living a life I had only ever fantasized about, yet a part of me felt disconnected, like I was watching it all unfold from behind a pane of glass.

The pressure to follow up with another hit was immense. My label was eager for a new album, my fans were clamoring for more music, and the fear of becoming a one-hit wonder loomed large. Every melody I wrote, every lyric I penned, was now scrutinized with a critical eye, the bar set impossibly high by the runaway success of my debut single.

I missed the anonymity of my old life, the simple pleasures of walking down the street without being recognized, of having conversations that weren’t dissected and analyzed by strangers. I missed the easy camaraderie of my musician friends, the shared struggles and triumphs that had forged a bond between us. Now, there was a distance, a subtle shift in their demeanor, a mixture of pride and perhaps a touch of envy.

Liam’s silence in the face of the online speculation was both a comfort and a source of anxiety. He wasn’t one for dramatic outbursts or public displays of emotion. His support had always been quiet and steadfast. But the lack of direct conversation about the rumors, the unspoken tension that sometimes hung in the air between us, was unsettling.

I knew I needed to talk to him, to bridge the growing gap that my new life had created. But the words often felt inadequate, the explanations hollow. How could I possibly convey the strange duality of feeling both incredibly successful and profoundly lost?

The comments about my body were a constant trigger. I’d always been self-conscious, but the relentless scrutiny of millions amplified those insecurities tenfold. Every outfit I wore, every photo that was taken, was analyzed for any perceived flaw. The pressure to maintain a perfect image was exhausting, a constant battle against my own natural imperfections.

I’d started working with a trainer, not because I particularly enjoyed grueling workouts, but because I felt like I had to. The comments, the subtle (and not-so-subtle) suggestions from my team, had chipped away at my self-acceptance. I wanted to be judged for my music, not my waistline.

As the night wore on, the city lights outside twinkled like distant stars, mirroring the digital constellations on my phone screen. I scrolled through more comments, the good and the bad swirling together in a dizzying vortex. It was a strange kind of intimacy, this connection with millions of strangers who felt entitled to an opinion on every aspect of my life.

I knew I couldn’t let the negativity consume me. I had to find a way to navigate this new reality, to hold onto the core of who I was amidst the chaos. My music was still my anchor, the one true thing that felt entirely mine.

With a newfound resolve, I closed the social media apps and placed my phone face down on the table. The silence in the apartment felt heavy, but also strangely liberating. I picked up the glass of wine again, the ruby liquid catching the light.

Tomorrow, there would be more interviews, more photoshoots, more demands on my time and energy. But tonight, in the quiet of my living room, I was just Elara again, a girl with a song in her heart and a story to tell. The journey was far from over, and the path ahead was uncertain. But for now, in this moment of quiet reflection, I allowed myself to simply be. The weight of the world could wait until morning. The music, however, would always be there, waiting to be heard. And that, I realized, was all that truly mattered.

The silence after putting down my phone was a fragile thing, easily shattered by the ghosts of the words I’d just read. My thumb still tingled with the phantom vibrations of scrolling, the endless feed of validation and vitriol. I took another sip of the Cabernet, the taste suddenly bitter on my tongue.

It wasn’t just the broad strokes of opinion that lingered. It was the specifics, the little barbs that burrowed under my skin and festered. Like the Motify (the sheer audacity of that name, a blatant rip-off of Spotify, yet somehow equally ubiquitous) notification that had popped up earlier, boasting a ludicrous increase in my monthly listeners. Millions. A number so vast it felt abstract, detached from the reality of me sitting here, grappling with the human cost of that very success.

And then there were the harmful clucks – the Twitter parody that had become a breeding ground for the most vile and unfounded accusations. I’d foolishly ventured onto it earlier, a morbid curiosity pulling me into the digital muck. One, in particular, had made my stomach churn: “Heard Luna’s ‘starlight’ came from spending nights with the label exec. Talentless hack riding on her back.” Another, equally poisonous: “Bet she’s got a casting couch in her studio. No way that voice is natural.”

A bitter laugh escaped my lips, echoing in the cavernous living room. Casting couch? I’d spent more nights sleeping on friends’ lumpy sofas than any executive’s anything. My studio was a cramped, soundproofed box in a less-than-glamorous part of town until about six months ago. The sheer audacity of these accusations, hurled by faceless strangers who knew nothing of the years of struggle, the sacrifices made, the sheer bloody hard work that had gone into every note, every lyric.

I rose from the plush sofa and walked to the window, the city lights blurring through the unshed tears that pricked at my eyes. “It’s a funny thing, isn’t it?” I murmured to the glass, my voice barely a whisper in the vast space. “You pour your heart and soul into something, you bleed onto the page, you hone your craft until your fingers ache and your voice is raw. You face rejection after rejection, you play to empty rooms, you eat instant noodles for weeks on end because that’s all you can afford. And then, finally, finally, something clicks. The world listens. They applaud. They call you ‘queen,’ ‘angel,’ ‘genius.’ And for a fleeting moment, you think, ‘Yes. It was worth it. All of it.’”

I turned away from the window, the reflection of my own weary face staring back at me. “But then… then the whispers start. The doubts creep in, amplified by a million anonymous voices. They don’t see the years of dedication. They don’t hear the cracked notes and the hesitant melodies of the early days. They don’t know the fear and the vulnerability that comes with sharing your innermost self with the world. No, they see a pretty face, a catchy tune, and they immediately look for the shortcut, the scandal, the easy explanation for your success that has nothing to do with the actual work.”

My fists clenched at my sides. “They dissect your body, they scrutinize your relationships, they invent tawdry narratives to explain away your achievements. They reduce years of passion and perseverance to a single, salacious rumour. And the worst part? The sheer, casual cruelty of it all. The way they type out these hateful things, hidden behind their screens, with no thought to the real person on the receiving end. It’s like throwing stones at a shadow, oblivious to the fact that the shadow belongs to someone who bleeds.”

The weight of it all settled back on my shoulders, heavy and suffocating. The irony wasn’t lost on me. I’d written a song about finding light in the darkness, about the power of connection and hope. And yet, the very platform that had catapulted that message to the world was also a breeding ground for so much darkness and disconnection.

I walked back to the coffee table, the empty wine glass a silent testament to the turbulent thoughts swirling in my head. The digital noise still echoed in the silence of the room, a phantom chorus of praise and condemnation. It was a constant battle to remember who I was beneath the layers of public perception, to hold onto the fragile core of Elara Vance in the overwhelming storm of Luna’s fame.

With a sigh that held a hint of weary resignation, I reached for the decanter. The rich, ruby liquid gurgled as it filled the glass once more. “Well,” I muttered to the empty room, a wry smile playing on my lips, “if they’re going to write dramatic narratives about my life, they might as well have a consistent prop.” And with that, Luna, or rather Elara, raised her refilled glass in a silent, slightly tipsy toast to the absurdity of it all. The online bullies could cluck and sneer, but at least she had a decent vintage to sip while they did.

1k316w5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k316w5,Advice for landscaping under Kentucky Coffee Tree,"Hi All! Bonjour!
Happy Spring!🌿

I just bought a house in greater Montreal (Zone 5b) that has a Ky coffee tree*. I'm unfamiliar with this species, having spent most of my life in Europe.

As you can see, the tree is bordered by a large hedge and some small beds, then patios on our side.
 The neighbor to the left has a small garden shed, and then behind the hedge is an east facing lawn in a public park. 

No heavy foot traffic on any side.

When we visited in the fall, there were peonies, hydrangea and LOTS of ferns underneath.

I'd really like to plant a higher diversity of plants here with some species that are more interesting to biodiversity. If I could, I'd love to plant where the grass is...

I'd love to take out at least some of the hydrangeas (and perhaps ferns, depending on the species) to establish a cottage style collection of native and nectar species.

My question is, how tolerant are KY coffee trees to this kind of root disturbance in your experience?

I think it's around 15 to 20 years old (30 at the most with this house).

I would try to be as respectful of the roots as possible when removing the hydrangeas, ferns, brick border and grass patch... I could plant very small plants, bulbs, or seeds... I would avoid adding too much soil/compost at once.

But this is definitely going to affect the fibrous roots at least some... I see KY Coffee trees also have taproots, so maybe it could handle it?

I don't want to kill the tree, obviously, but this is the only patch not paved in this tiny backyard for now 😫  And I find it terribly sad.

Any advice is much appreciated! 

If I can't rip out the plants there already, what do you think about smothering them with cardboard, for example?

Could I add a few raised beds, or is that just worse?

THANKS so much! 🙏 
Cheers!🌷🌿☀️

It's a mahagony coffeetable depicting the map of the world in Robinson Projection measuring 130 x 70 cm. I was consindering the more modern Winkel Triple Projektion but frankly the shape of the Robinson Projection seemed handier as a table 

I've used over 35 different Types of Wood veneer for the countries. The water masses are made out of Double bookmatched walnut burl. I've also used mother of pearl and silver gilding for cardinal direction markers. The negative in the water masses as well as complex coastal lines were Cut using a lasercutter. 

The table top is Made of veneered Blockboard with 5 cm thick Solid wood Edge banding in which a Profile was cut with a shaper and Handheld router. 

The table base was inspired by Waters and aclands tri-table and is Made of Birdseye mahagony and Maple utilizing bent lamination. It will later hold an elliptical brown-glass plate. 

Usually that's a Project one would typically want to finish by French polishing. As this is a table top that's meant to be used I opted for a 2 component acrylate varnish for Maximum protection.

1k314yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/bugfreeAI/comments/1k314yn/master_object_oriented_design_interviews_by/,Master Object Oriented Design Interviews by Recognizing the Problem Type,"After conducting and participating in many object-oriented design (OOD) interviews, I’ve learned that the key to performing well isn’t just about drawing clean class diagrams or throwing in design patterns. It’s about **understanding the type of problem you’re solving** and knowing how to approach it with the right mindset and tools.

Many candidates jump straight into implementation without fully grasping the domain or the core design challenge. This often leads to bloated, overly complex designs — or worse, solutions that miss the point entirely.

To avoid that, start by classifying the OOD question into one of the following common categories. Each type has a unique focus, and interviewers are typically looking for specific thinking patterns depending on the category.

https://preview.redd.it/jgg2qtqstcse1.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=2850c411ca06487785d8ba61bcc0a21a16df944e

Object Oriented Design Question Collection: [https://bugfree.ai/collection/ood-top](https://bugfree.ai/collection/ood-top)

# 1. Abstract Simulation Systems

These questions are focused on modeling physical systems or machines. You’re often asked to simulate real-world behaviors such as dispensing a product, moving between floors, or parking a car.

**Examples:**

* Design Vending Machine
* Design Parking Lot System
* Design Elevator System
* Design Coffee Machine

**How to approach:**

* Identify the core components: what entities are involved, and what behaviors do they exhibit?
* Focus on state transitions. For instance, a vending machine transitions between `Idle`, `ProcessingPayment`, and `DispensingItem`.
* Use patterns like **State**, **Strategy**, or **Command** where behavior changes over time or by input.
* Keep concerns separated: input handling, processing, and output should not all sit in the same class.

**What interviewers are evaluating:**

* Your ability to model stateful behavior cleanly
* Use of appropriate abstractions and encapsulation
* Flexibility to add new features or states without major redesign

**Common mistakes:**

* Hardcoding behaviors that should be dynamic
* Failing to handle edge cases (e.g., invalid input, out-of-stock items)
* Designing systems that aren’t extensible

# 2. Media and Control Systems

These problems involve systems with user-triggered actions, where components must react to events in real time. You’ll often be dealing with play controls, queues, and history tracking.

**Examples:**

* Design Music Player

**How to approach:**

* Identify the control flow: what are the user commands and what do they trigger?
* Implement the core interface (`Playable`, `Controllable`, etc.) with clear responsibilities.
* Handle complex behavior such as shuffle, repeat, and playback queues.
* Use the **Observer** pattern for things like updating UI or playback listeners.
* Plan for error states, such as when a track file is missing or corrupted.

**What interviewers are evaluating:**

* Your understanding of interactive workflows and real-time event handling
* Ability to design loosely coupled systems
* Clear modeling of control logic versus media data

**Common mistakes:**

* Tightly coupling playback logic with user interface
* Overlooking the data layer for track metadata or playback history
* Ignoring concurrency or asynchronous behavior

# 3. Real-World Application Systems

These simulate end-to-end applications such as booking platforms, e-commerce carts, or user profile management. These problems often mimic real startup or enterprise features.

**Examples:**

* Design Hotel Reservation System
* Design Online Shopping Cart
* Design Ride-Sharing App
* Design Student Information System

**How to approach:**

* Start by identifying user roles and primary use cases (e.g., guest books room, admin updates availability).
* Model relationships: user → booking → room, or customer → cart → product.
* Use layered architecture: separate controllers, services, and data models.
* Consider validations, constraints, and edge cases (e.g., overlapping reservations, time zone handling).
* Plan for extensibility: how will you add coupons, inventory management, or payment gateways later?

**What interviewers are evaluating:**

* Depth of domain modeling
* Ability to break down a complex workflow into clean, modular components
* Thoughtfulness in handling real-world constraints

**Common mistakes:**

* Not asking clarifying questions about business logic
* Creating overly simplified or overly complex models
* Ignoring the difference between temporary and persistent state

# 4. Consistency-Critical / Data-Intensive Systems

These systems require precision and safety over speed. They’re often found in domains like banking, academic records, or financial trading where **data integrity** is paramount.

**Examples:**

* Design Banking System
* Design Stock Trading System
* Design Student Information System

**How to approach:**

* Define operations that must be atomic (e.g., transfer funds, update grades).
* Think through data consistency, even in multi-threaded or distributed environments.
* Apply appropriate synchronization techniques or use transactions.
* Design around auditability and traceability. For example, log every transaction or update.
* Include role-based access control for sensitive actions.

**What interviewers are evaluating:**

* Your understanding of consistency guarantees and concurrency control
* Ability to reason about multi-user access, race conditions, and rollbacks
* Thoughtful trade-offs between complexity and robustness

**Common mistakes:**

* Ignoring thread safety or concurrent modifications
* Missing critical edge cases (e.g., double-spending, overdrafts)
* Not modeling long-term storage or logging requirements

# Final Thoughts

The goal of OOD interviews isn’t just to draw a pretty diagram — it’s to demonstrate how you think. Before you code or diagram anything, take time to:

* Understand the core domain and constraints
* Classify the question type and identify common patterns
* Think through interactions, scalability, and flexibility
* Communicate your assumptions and clarify ambiguities

Great candidates don’t just provide a solution — they lead the interviewer through a clean, structured thought process and show how they’d adapt the design in a real-world environment.",1,1745082619.0,bugfreeAI,0,1.0,False

anyway, is that weird? am i just chronically lonely? 😭 do i need to get a life?",4,1745082527.0,LesbianActually,1,1.0,False

23 yo single male, currently making $70k a year before taxes with a guaranteed $1.5k-$2k post tax bonus at my full time job. I also umpire softball/baseball in summers that typically generates an extra $3k-5k per year and I view it as a fun hobby/side hustle. All in all let’s say $75k pre tax. 

Current assets: I have a robinhood with $24k-26k (topped out at 32k a few months ago), as well as a Coinbase account with $5k. Roth IRA with ~$48k and Roth 401k at $5.5k. I have $10.3k between two savings accounts, as well as 3 fully paid off vehicles (93 ranger, 04 civic, 06 civic) with the intent to sell atleast one of them (06 civic ~ $1000-$1500, 93 ranger ~$2000–$2500)

Expenses and debt: $9.2k in student loans.  rent + utilities + wifi $400/month although I am moving back in with family shortly to save more for real estate. $800 between gasoline for vehicles, insurance, groceries, food out, subscriptions, as well as wants. I typically don’t buy anything that I don’t desperately need which is why my expenses may seem much lower than others. 

Like I stated at the top, my intention is to get into real estate with my first property this year or next. The average 1500-1900sq ft. “Decent/good” house in my area will be atleast 250k more likely 300+ if move in ready with hardly any updates needed. Ideally I would like a multi family 2-4 unit but are pretty rare in my market and surrounding cities. I would like to buy one that needs a facelift to save me money, as well as get me experience with minor repairs. 

Im meeting with an agent next week for coffee to ask some questions. When I want to put an offer on a property I will most likely need to drain my robinhood to cover the downpayment anytime in the next 6 months. Would others out there recommend this path or should I save and wait until the end of 2026 when I should have roughly 60-80k in savings.

I'm almost 2 months in and having success at a steady 2lbs a week, very minor side effects for the most part.  I did notice however that my usual daily after coffee bowel movements had shifted to every other day and this week I had a gap of a few days with no bm and then had a horrible experience with a hard stool movement and lets just say it was not fun.   

Coming out the other side now I realize I overlooked the warning signs and that while I think my daily water intake is good my fiber intake has been too low and when combined with the known side effect from the Bupropion it caught up with me.  

The support from hims has been great, I chatted with them and they recommended that I stop taking the meds until this is sorted out and that I consult with my primary care physician to get the ole cornhole checked out before resuming the program.

I'm a few days out now and feeling much better and will see my regular doc on Monday so hopefully I can get restarted, I'm sure he will give me a hard time as he was not a big fan of the hims treatment as he wanted me to go on Mounjaro, but my crappy insurance wouldn't cover it and I couldn't swing the $1000 a month on my own, so here we are...

## Herkent u deze problemen? Symptomen van een defecte Saeco pomp

Voordat we in de details treden over het vervangen van de pomp, is het cruciaal om vast te stellen of de pomp daadwerkelijk de oorzaak van het probleem is. Een **saeco pomp defect** kan zich op verschillende manieren uiten. Let op de volgende symptomen bij uw Philips EP2224/10:

*   **Geen water of een zwakke straal:** De meest voorkomende indicatie is dat er helemaal geen water uit de machine komt,of slechts een zwakke straal. Dit kan duiden op een verstopte of defecte waterpomp.
*   **Lawaaierige pomp:** Een gezonde pomp zou relatief stil moeten zijn. Als de pomp extreem luidruchtig is, vreemde geluiden maakt (zoals piepen, knarsen of brommen), kan dit een teken zijn van slijtage of een defect.
*   **Trage koffiezettijd:** Als het langer duurt dan normaal om een kop koffie te zetten, kan dit komen doordat de pomp niet voldoende druk kan opbouwen.
*   **Foutmeldingen:** De Philips EP2224/10 kan mogelijk een foutmelding weergeven die wijst op een probleem met de watertoevoer of de pomp. consulteer de handleiding van uw machine om de specifieke betekenis van de foutmelding te achterhalen.
*   **Water lekt:** Soms kan een defecte pomp leiden tot waterlekkage rondom de pomp zelf of in de machine. Het is belangrijk om te controleren op lekkage.
*   **Saeco machine maakt geen koffie:** Als de pomp niet functioneert, kan de machine logischerwijs geen koffie zetten.

Als u een of meerdere van deze symptomen herkent,is het waarschijnlijk dat de **philips ep2224/10 waterpomp** een probleem heeft en mogelijk vervangen moet worden.

## Oorzaken van Pomp Falen: Waarom begeeft uw Saeco pomp het?

Verschillende factoren kunnen bijdragen aan het falen van de pomp in uw Philips EP2224/10. Kennis van deze oorzaken kan u helpen bij het voorkomen van toekomstige problemen en het verlengen van de levensduur van uw espressomachine. Enkele veelvoorkomende oorzaken zijn:

*   **Kalkaanslag:** Kalkaanslag is de grootste vijand van espressomachines. Afzettingen van kalk kunnen de pomp verstoppen, waardoor deze harder moet werken en uiteindelijk kan falen.Regelmatig ontkalken is cruciaal. Het gebruik van een **saeco aqua clean filter**, hoewel niet een volledige oplossing, kan helpen om de kalkvorming te verminderen en de pomp te beschermen.
*   **Leeftijd en slijtage:** Net als alle andere mechanische onderdelen heeft de pomp een beperkte levensduur. Na verloop van tijd zal de pomp slijten en minder efficiënt worden,wat uiteindelijk tot een defect kan leiden.
*   **Overbelasting:** Het forceren van de machine om herhaaldelijk koffie te zetten zonder voldoende rust tussen de zetsessies kan de pomp overbelasten en de levensduur verkorten.
*   **Drooglopen:** Als de machine wordt ingeschakeld zonder voldoende water in het reservoir, kan de pomp drooglopen. Dit kan ernstige schade aan de pomp veroorzaken.
*   **Vervuiling:** Kleine deeltjes koffie of andere vreemde voorwerpen kunnen in de pomp terechtkomen en de werking ervan belemmeren.
*   **Defect Aquaclean filter philips:** Indien het Aquaclean filter verstopt is of niet op tijd wordt vervangen kan dit ook leiden tot problemen met de waterdoorvoer, de pomp extra belasten en hierdoor een defect veroorzaken.

*   **Vervanging:** De meest voorkomende en vaak de meest betrouwbare oplossing is om de pomp te vervangen. Dit garandeert dat de machine weer optimaal functioneert en verlengt de levensduur van de machine.

**Welke optie is het beste voor u?** Het hangt af van de volgende factoren:

*   **De ernst van het probleem:** Is de pomp slechts verstopt of is er sprake van ernstige schade?
*   **Uw technische vaardigheden:** Bent u comfortabel met het zelf uitvoeren van reparaties?
*   **De kosten:** Wat zijn de kosten van reparatie versus vervanging?
*   **De leeftijd van de machine:** Is de machine al oud? In dat geval kan het verstandiger zijn om te investeren in een nieuwe pomp.

Going to make this as short as possible. I (late 20s, M) met a guy at my school library who I’ll call *Charles*. We started hanging out almost every day. I felt safe opening up to him about serious stuff — childhood bullying, family issues, past mental health struggles (including suicidal thoughts). He was a good listener, and even introduced me to his church and his circle of friends.

Over time, I noticed some red flags. He and his brother started bringing up politics — mainly defending Donald Trump — and slowly tried to sway my views. I made it clear I wasn’t a supporter, and Charles asked me what *percentage* of my political views were influenced by my dad (a Democrat). I said I didn’t want to get into it and felt boxed in.

The next day, I told him his comments felt arrogant and asked for an apology. He refused to do it over text and insisted we meet in person. After a lot of back and forth, we met — I even bought him a coffee — but instead of an apology, I got insulted. He told me I had low self-esteem, said I was trying to ""bring him down to my level,"" and even told me the devil was speaking through me. He tried to force prayer on me, asked for a hug (I declined), and overall made me feel completely disrespected and belittled. I walked away from the friendship after that.

Since then, I’ve stopped going to the church group. People from church text me asking where I’ve been, and I just say I’m busy with school/work to avoid drama. His brother even deleted me off LinkedIn. Now when Charles sees me, he tries to act like nothing happened — gives me a fist bump and says “What’s up bro,” which I reciprocate just to avoid conflict. But it feels performative, like he’s trying to stay in my head.

I’m worried he might be telling people about personal things I shared — including that I once had suicidal thoughts — to make me look unstable or gain sympathy. I haven’t responded to him or his friends since late January. His friend occasionally texts saying, “Let me know when you’re around so we can catch up,” but I always say I’m busy.

So — AITA for walking away and not explaining anything to his friends or the church group? I feel like I’m protecting my peace, but part of me feels like I lost something or I’m letting him control the narrative.",9,1745081877.0,AITAH,25,1.0,False
1k30ubi,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1k30ubi/claridges_vs_mandarin_oriental_hyde_park_london/,Claridge’s vs. Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park – London Hotel Report + Lobster Pasta,"**TL;DR:** Claridge’s is by far the favorite. Mandarin Oriental is still a 4.0+ stay — just stylistically not for me.

**Claridge’s – 5 Nights in Mayfair**

Claridge’s for five nights was amazing. It’s a city hotel, so it’s not going to be the resort vibe, but once you’re in the hotel, it’s that amazing art deco, beautiful hotel with this amazing bone china and insane floral arrangements. The staff there feels like a warm hug — seriously, they were so attentive. Every morning they knew exactly what I wanted, what type of coffee I had, how hot I wanted it, if I wanted a paper or not. They were witty, humorous, engaging — just a joy.

They had a table reserved for me every morning right next to the floral arrangement in the foyer room, and it was just so amazing. The bar was really nice, not too loud, but a good vibe — good for dinner, relaxed and casual with a good music. Busy, and the food was great — I had fish and chips there and it was hands down the best I’ve ever had in London.

The gym is downstairs — it’s a nice, well-appointed gym, but it’s pretty small. Same with the spa — updated and beautiful, but again, just kind of small and tucked downstairs. The rooms are city rooms, of course, so they’re not massive, but for a Junior Suite it was really nice. I had a living room, a nice bedroom, a walk-in closet, and a beautiful bathroom with a standalone tub that looked out over London. Also a wonderful shower and the full Toto toilet with the warming seat, which is basically heaven.

I had Room 556 — I liked it, I didn’t love it. The layout wasn’t ideal. The living room was sectioned off in a way that made you lose some square footage. The balcony had a good view, not a *fantastic* one. But the bed was incredibly comfortable. The tech in the room is super modern, you don’t need any converters or anything, and again — the bathroom was all marble and just really, really well done.

But what makes Claridge’s truly special is the service. The whole place feels like a family giving you a warm hug. That’s the part that sticks.

**Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park – 3 Nights in Knightsbridge**

Mandarin Oriental — the room (721) was more open and less sectioned off than Claridge’s. It was just a large space with a **stunning view of Hyde Park**, and I could watch the horses for the changing of the guard. That’s actually why I booked the room, and yes, I got to see it — major highlight.

The big difference between the two hotels is the *vibe* of the service. Mandarin Oriental just felt more like a really attentive executive assistant — everything I needed was there, it was quick and seamless, but not as engaging or humorous or warm. One woman who seated me for tea was lovely, but everyone else felt a bit colder and more businesslike.

The **food wasn’t as good** either. Scones and pastries were better at Claridge’s. The sandwiches were about the same. I will say I liked that MO gave you iced tea options, which Claridge’s didn’t. Still, Claridge’s just had the better overall experience — softer, more relaxed, more enjoyable. I would have much rather been there.

As for the room — I think MO maybe had slightly nicer furniture, but Claridge’s had the much nicer bathroom. Mandarin Oriental wins for **views**, no question.

The **gym** at MO is also downstairs, but much larger and has all brand-new machines and a better weightlifting setup. It was fantastic. The **pool** was open — beautiful down there, but very humid and hot. A little overwhelming if you’re actually trying to get a workout in.

I didn’t use MO’s spa, so can’t comment on that.

**Location-wise**, Mayfair is quintessential London - to me. It’s quiet, walkable, and full of beautiful streets. Knightsbridge, where MO is, is right on the tube line and on the park, and definitely a busier area with more traffic. Great for shopping and hitting Harrods, but not really my style. I was much happier in Mayfair.

**FATTravel London Meetup, Raffles and Dinner with Sarah**

While I was in town, I also got to grab dinner with u/SarahWLee, which was a lot of fun. I work with Codi on her team, but it was great to finally meet Sarah in person. Huge shoutout to both of them — they’re incredible resources. I was traveling solo, so getting to catch up over dinner made the trip feel a little more social and fun.

We also ended up having a **FATTravel meetup** with some other folks at the **Raffles London** bar, which was lovely. I got a quick tour of the Raffles lobby and the dining room where James Bond was invented, which is just a great line to say out loud. Raffles itself is absolutely beautiful, both the façade and the interiors. I haven’t stayed there (yet), but it’s definitely on the list. It’s in a different part of the city — closer to the river — but it’s such a beautifully done building, and the location still feels central and connected.

**Bonus: The Great Lobster Pasta Face-Off**

I also decided to keep the **lobster pasta tour** alive and asked the concierges at Claridge’s, Mandarin Oriental, and The Lanesborough for their best recommendations. I went to all three + 1 bonus recco that made multiple lists (although it wasn't the top). Winner only based off the lobster pasta:

**Winner: Gaia’s** — this was the recommendation from the MO concierge, and it was fantastic. Good amount of sauce, good pasa, and served with the lobster.

**Second place: Cecconi's - Claridge’s pick** — very good sauce, and lots of it.

**Third: Signor Sassi - Lanesborough's pick** — totally fine, visually the most appetizing and enticing, just not as memorable - sauce was less flavorful..

Bonus shoutout to Claridge’s again — they actually followed up and asked me which one won. The other two didn’t. Again, Claridge’s staff just gets it. They match the guest where they’re at.

**Hotel Tour Extras - Not a travel agent, but ask and you shall receive.**

I also toured **The Emory** and **The Berkeley** while I was in town. At The Emory, I only got to see the **Presidential Suite** because that’s all that was open — and yeah, it was absolutely stunning. €60k/night kind of stunning. The Berkeley had a lot of character — I really liked that every floor is different, every suite is designed differently, with different views, stonework, and layouts.

If I had to pick? I’d take **The Emory** over **The Berkeley**, just because of the modern edge and those floor-to-ceiling windows. They do technically share a restaurant lobby passage near the **Cedric Grolet bakery**, by the way, which is also worth checking out if you like amazing pastries. Bonus: both are one minute from MO.

**Final Thoughts**

* **Claridge’s:** warm, thoughtful, stylish — and just a great vibe overall. I will be back.
* **Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park:** beautiful room, incredible views, but a little too “corporate luxury” for me.
* **Raffles:** on the future-stay list. Absolutely stunning and full of charm.
* **Sarah:** Fantastic.
* **Lobster pasta challenge:** taken seriously. Results delivered.
* **London:** It was my first time, and a solo trip—8 sunny days—couldn't have been luckier.
* **Using a TA?:** Yes, I used u/codigofar and there were gifts in my room, an upgrade at Claridge’s (jr suite to jr suite with balcony) and multiple amenities - plus the usual perks (free breakfast, late checkout, room credit - highly recommend).

I also did some **private historic tours,** and a lot of dining around - so feel free to ask if you want any recs.",6,1745081859.0,FATTravel,0,0.75,False

With Frostfall, drinks and hot soups are supposed to have an extra effect that adds to your Warmth Rating, but this isn't populating for me. I wonder if it has to do with the placement Warm Drinks mod, which I have ordered under ""Purely Craftable"" using the LLO 2 Spreadsheet, or if it has something to do with Frostfall itself.

1k30sup,https://i.redd.it/lbij2zdzntve1.jpeg,Finally tried the Coffee,"Just got back from a trip out of town and I was super tired getting off the plane. I was also hungry so we went to In n out since it is right by the airport we landed in (one exit over).

I was just going to get my usual Diet Coke since there’s caffeine in it, but I thought given how tired I was it was the near perfect scenario to try the coffee (I prefer Diet Coke to coffee or tea typically) since I heard good things about it.

Definitely did not disappoint. Maybe it’s because I don’t normally drink coffee but it was surprisingly strong and had a rich after taste. Pretty well balanced. 

I can’t tell if I’m surprised because it’s from in n out or because it’s actually good coffee.

I wouldn’t expect a latte or anything like that. Just imagine some surprisingly solid “house coffee” from a very unexpected place.

It makes sense tho when you think about it.

Harry (the founder) liked his coffee a certain way (from the in n out book)  “the Dutch love their coffee”). He wrote it down just like everything else.

I have questions for any associates reading this:
1. How often is it made?
2. Is it really the thing with the most prep steps at in n out?
3. I’m under the impression that the coffee was also something Harry offered to cops along with free burgers and fries. How true is that?

I don’t normally drink coffee, but I know decent coffee when I taste it. I also mentioned this to my dad who drinks coffee more regularly and he agreed that it was unexpectedly good and he said arguably better than McDonalds coffee, but I wouldn’t know perfectly.

Im 35f, husband is 31m, we have an 8 year old son. Married 10 years, 11 soon.


He had planned for a few weeks this trip to the beach yesterday, us and his ex co workers, he bought some stuff even though only one told him she was going, but she is the type of person if the others don't go she also doesn't. And that's what happened. Yesterday morning, he wrote again. No one, just one that said she would me us afterward to eat. He didn't tell me that the plan was to go to a restaurant. And since it was Good Friday, many places were closed. So I didn't bring any extra clothes since we were coming straight home (beach is just 45 min away) or eating in some less fancy place since we would have sand and all that other beach stuff.

I took a shower and got dressed feeling great about myself. A few months ago, I was diagnosed with Endometrial Cancer, but treatment worked, and since it was in stage 1, it regresed with treatment. I still have to monitor everything and keep taking some hormonal treatment, but for now Im out of the red. I got this good news 5 days ago. And I've been in a good space mentally since then. I was able to sleep without meds, and my chest stopped hurting because of the anxiety attacks I had. Yesterday was our first date out after the news. I was very happy.

He was in the bedroom with his coffee on the hand. He told me that he keeps leaving the places he likes to buy coffee because of me, I didn't understood, and I asked why? he told me in the last few months he has already changed places 4 times, because when he start going regularly they start talking to him differently and flirtly. And that he stops going because of me. 

I still wasn't sure what was happening. Until I asked him why was he telling me this, what was the point in bragging that he did that out of nowhere. He said he wasn't bragging but that he wanted to tell me about it because he thought it was a good thing to tell me he was doing it for me, but now he doesn't have many places to get his coffee. Which I reply with: then tell me:  I didn't feel comfortable going there and that's it, not because of me. I told him he sounded like he wanted me to acknowledge that he was faithful because of me, instead of him having respect out of the both of us.


We get to the beach. He started placing everything, just a few things, we didn't bring much. And then he starts complaining about doing everything by himself. I stopped and went to the water alone. Our son went after me and he stayed. On his phone and vaping. After a while, he comes to us and asks if Im mad or just ignoring him. 

I told him: it was about your stupid comment of you doing everything since I was the one who got up early to prepare everything this morning, but you don't see me complaining about you not helping me.
 
He told he he wanted me to help him set the beach umbrella and the towel in the sand. A very small unbrella and a towel. Something that took him 5 minutes to do, and he complains about it.

Out of nowhere, he was talking to our son and then shifted and started telling him that he is a liar and that I tell him that always. Trying to get me to talk, but I didn't. The day passed and we were going back, he told me about the restaurant and ask me why I didn't bring any more clothes to change. I told him since it was in the plans I decided to go light, and to eat some place where there is not a strick dress code. He gave me a look, and stopped talking, he told me to call the co worker to meet us but we have to check first what was open. I barely know them and Im not confortable talking to them like that. I told him he was the one with the plan, that he should do it, I only said nothing fancy because were not dress for it.

He didn't say much, he got us food and we came home..were at bed and I see a notification telling him that they hope I feel well soon. And to make plans for another day. 

So the excuse for us not going is because I wasn't feeling well and decided to come straight home. As always using me as an excuse, how many times will I keep hearing him cancel things with work and his family because of me ""not feeling well"" when I straight told him yesterday that I was feeling great. And many other times he wanted to get out of something but he doesn't want to one with the issue. And he tell me he doesn't lie and that he hates how his parents are liars. Is he not doing the same?

He portraits as the perfect husband, caring, loving, helpful, faithful. But no. He is carring but mostly and recently only through nagging, or telling me how weed would solve my issues/pain. Whenever he repeatedly ask for me to take some I tell him: you need to stop Dr. Weed, if I say no respect that. And the next day or few days after the same again.

He doesn't touch me at all, only to grab my ass and boobs, thats his way of telling me how much he wants me. I told him many many times that he need to stop doing that, and that he only wants me for sex. Even on the days we have sex he pushes for more. He as an issue with his depression med and that makes him finishing after a long period of time or not at all. Im not blaming him, its not his fault, but he think that me getting there for 30+ minutes without changing position is enjoyable for me, I always end up very sore and with chafed skin. Or to watch porn while he is on top, but barely looking at me.  

Yes he is the main bread winner at home. He works out 5 days a week. I go out too to clean houses some days a month, shower and groom an enderly, bedridden person on the weekends, weeks days Im with our son school, zoom clases, he has teachers to explain the stuff to learn, but we the parents have to be there with them and help with homework before deadline at 3:00pm, and mostly at home scheduling his route for his business. Almost everything I have money wise I give to him to help with the bill and his credit cards. I buy all my stuff, and our sons too, I pay for his school, cleaning supplies,  I try to keep the house as cleaninly as I possible can, we have a 5 month old kitten. I clean the dishes, clothes, bathroom, everything except his side next to the bed. 

Where he leaves plates with food, dozens of cups with coffee, water, juice. Maybe once or twice a week he would take them out to clean and leave it on the counter top. I end up cleaning them or when not in the mood it stay in there. He complains. I tell him to clean his stuff up he tells me Im nagging him.

I don't even what to get started on the weed, to resume, he is vaping every few minutes while were out. At home he is high, so its like he is not even here.


Today I woke up and went into my study, and stayed there. Just sitting there. I saw him coming out of the bedroom. And comes over to me and ask how long I have been awake, since I'm didn't take my pills. I told him I woke up at 6:45am when the cat wanted some food. I told him I didn't bother him, nor made much sound and for me that is not that early since I fell asleep before 9-10pm. He noticed my tone, and left. What am I even doing here?

I havent talk to him since this morning and I don't want to. I feel so much disappointment, and Im being resentful towards him. Lately everything he tells me or ask me in my head Im just: Why don't you just shut up. The other day he wanted me to give him a massage with some thc oil he ""bought for me"" since I only use it once, I put it in his stuff, but then he could find it, he kept looking at he while I was searching. And then telling me to stop searching over and over. I said: Shut Up already on a very faint voice, but he heard me and asked: did you really told me to shut up stupid?  Which I ignore and kept looking.

Things like that are what I hate about him, while everyone sees him as the good husband, caring, loving, and respectful, and he thinks he is all that.

And yes, I know he has his mental health conditions, and he's stressed out, but why everything has to revolve around him. I even stopped telling him whenever I felt bad because he would always counter with his pain or workload or whatever instead of just listening, he only shut up after I told him I need him to listen and dont say anything.

And when he pushes for an answer, I always reply with: yes, I feel horrible today, but I didn't want to tell you because I know you have it worse. Then he says is not a contest, but it sure does feel that way everyday.

-bacon, sausage, black pudding (just a slice)
-egg, poached preferable, fried acceptable not scrambled 
-mushrooms
-cooked tomato 
-beans (I like em thick and jammy) but I definitely appreciate them in their own pot so that I can choose where to tip them and what other components they touch.
-brown sauce not red (or the fruity sauce is allowed)
-one slice of fried bread
-a good side of toast, toast in a rack not on the plate, enough left over so you may or may not have marmalade on a slice after. This is gonna keep you going all day! The type of bread is personal preference, sometimes a posh brown sourdough but if you want a square white out of the packet I'll oblige. 
-controversially I do like the addition of green just so it's more aesthetically pleasing, spinach is perfect. Feel free to leave it if you don't want it but if I'm cooking I'll give it to you. 
-no potato based products thanks, they're for a roast dinner!

""It's an entire planet. Are we really going to miss?""

""Cut it.""

Captain Munroe takes a sip of his coffee, watching the asteroids close in for the kill. Easily thousands of the things, coated in stealth composite and guided with precision. The gas giant looms large in the background, silhouetting their target with razor-edged clarity. Though technically a moon, the forge world was larger than Mars, glittering with lights and pouring out radio signals into the void.

He spares a thought for all the aliens living there, savoring their calm, happy lives.

They should have thought about it too, before moving to territory claimed by humanity.

The asteroids cross detection range and the planet lights up, lances of collated plasma stabbing into the void. The rocks glitter, their stealth coating stripped away as the planet's orbital defenses melt them with terrible rapidity.

But there were too many, coming all at once. The first lands, splashing out a shockwave of molten stone and hazy dust. The second overlaps it, their impact ripples clashing in a terrible tidal wave of glowing red devastation.

Munroe takes another sip, watching the planet's cities go dead and their transmissions silent as yet more impactors smash into the surface.

""Good work, everyone. Secure from launch posture, make sure the next target is where we left it.""

""Aye, sir.""

""Aye, sir.""

""Aye.... incoming transmission. Tayn Coalition Command.""

His hand tightens on hid mug.

""So now they decide to pipe in, after we've done all the work for them. Okay, put it through.""

It wasn't a voice. Not really. Just a low-bandwidth text transmission that the launch carrier's VI was putting sound to.

\[UN vessel, this is a travel advisory. A Xel'Naya battlestar will be passing through your system to set up a superbulk navigational beacon. Authorization has already been given by the requisite authorities.\]

""Codes check out, sir.""

Damnit, were the powers that be on Earth just going to let their new allies roll all over them? Just because they had thrown around some empty promises about ""enforcing human sovereignty""?

""Acknowledged.""

\[Recommend you move beyond this system's Oort cloud for your safety.\]

""They're kicking us out? Seriously?""

The helm officer's comment echoes Captain Munroe's sentiment exactly.

""Send the following: 'Enemy forces are still present in this system. Recommend you halt planned construction until UN forces have finished neutralizing enemy presence.'""

""Sending, sir.""

There are a few seconds of pause.

""Receiving.""

\[Indications are that enemy automated defenses are trivial. Battlestar will make transit in five minutes. Recommend that you move beyond the Oort cloud.\]

""They closed the channel.""

Munroe has to work to unclench his jaw.

""Hold position. Let's keep an eye on them.""

The next five minutes pass like molasses as Munroe paces, waiting for whatever forces their allies were sending to arrive. Hopefully they would at least help him secure the system before setting up their little beacon.

""Holy shit!""

The helm officer's startled explanation is cut off by a sudden lurch as the deck heaves under Munroe's feet.

""Report, ensign.""

""Massive new gravitational field. I'm struggling to compensate.""

""Contact, contact! Massive contact. It's confusing the navigational system.""

""Project.""

The screen at the front of the bridge lights up, displaying... Munroe struggles to parse the image.

A geodesic sphere made of pinkish crystal and golden highlights, passing through the most violent subspace rift he had ever seen. The edges crackle with energy, wavy and insubstantial, as if the universe wanted to shut the whole thing as fast as possible. The deck heaves again.

""What are we looking at?""

The sensor officer taps at her console with one hand while the other holds fast to a stabilizing handle.

""I... it's... I think it's a Dyson sphere.""

""That's not possible.""

""What else- escort fleet warping in. Contacts number in the... billions, at least. The threat population system can't handle them all.""

""Captain, whatever they're doing, it's shaking us apart. I can't keep us at station. We're going to break up.""

Captain Munroe struggles to swallow past his suddenly dry throat. He realizes that he'd lost his coffee mug somewhere in the chaos.

Almost 3 years ago, a married guy showed interest in me, and I developed intense limerence. I tried to confront him, but he sent mixed signals, acted cold, and invalidated my mental health struggles. My past trauma resurfaced, and I went no contact to process my feelings. Later, I reached out with a casual message, but he never replied. Now, to gain closure and move on, I want to reach out again to disclose my feelings, but it feels too awkward.

**Full story:**

I met a new acquaintance about 3 years ago, and we spoke only 5 times over 2-3 months, so I barely know him. Before this LE, I had never been interested in people who were already in relationships.

It all started when, one day, he accidentally found out that I liked him. I became so nervous around him that he guessed why. He looked shocked and simply disappeared. About a month later, he suddenly appeared at my door and invited me to a small neighborhood social event he was hosting. I was perplexed to see how happy he seemed - he was glowing and appeared totally infatuated with me.

He wasn't even my neighbor - his parents were - but it seemed like he had intentionally chosen my neighborhood to invite me.

At that event, where his spouse was also present, he managed to find a few minutes when no one could hear us and basically asked me out. It was all very subtle, disguised as a casual offer to help with something I needed previously, followed by a suggestion of going out for a ""friendly"" coffee or drink. He even asked about my future plans (he knew I was considering moving to another city and asked if I wanted to stay in his). Then he said, ""You have my number"".

I freaked out. My first thought was that he was just trying to drag me into an affair. He also made a judgmental, sarcastic comment about how I had too much ""free time"" (according to his toxic parents, whom I'll mention below). I panicked and probably looked at him with disgust. Later, I realized he most likely took it personally, because I remember how suddenly upset and quiet he became and sometimes avoided even looking at me.

After that day, I immediately developed incredibly intense limerence. I had liked him from the first day, but actual limerent episode started because his sudden feelings appeared so genuine and endearing (e.g., his nonverbal cues), and he seemed very shy at times. I knew he had talked about me with other people, and they began noticing his interest in me. But, obviously, I didn't know his true intentions.

After a few weeks of contemplation, I decided I had to confront him for the sake of my peace of mind. I met him, but he acted cold, as if nothing had happened between us. He even casually mentioned his spouse. I was confused and shocked. I couldn't reveal my feelings and instinctively pretended I didn't even like him.

It's worth mentioning for context that I’ve had a lot of trauma in my past and have struggled with depression for years. When I met him, I was going through another depressive episode. Gradually, I was starting to get better, but then his parents began invalidating my struggles and emotionally abusing me (long story...). But LO also didn’t seem to take my struggles seriously, even though he didn’t know anything about my past trauma or that I actually had depression. I felt judged. (To be fair, he did validate my feelings once and admitted his parents were not without issues.) 

Back to my conversation with LO. He said something like, ""I see my parents' perspective, and I see yours too."" I looked at him with anger, because they had been abusive toward me. Then, while we were talking, his parent, who believed I 'owed' them, suddenly appeared and verbally attacked me (again), yelling that I was just ""doing nothing"" (because of my depression-related fatigue) and that I was ""lazy"". And LO grinned. Evilly.

There are no words to describe how hurtful it was. I was triggered immensely and began dissociating, seeing flashbacks from past abuse right in front of him. I remember seeing LO's confused face staring at me. Then he said he had to go but stood there, staring at me until his parent forced him to leave. 

That evening, I received the first and last message from him. It was quite formal but seemed kind in tone. He included some useful links and wrote, ""Hope this helps. I'm sorry about this situation. Take care.""

Several weeks later, I saw him standing on the street, very close to my house, looking at my window. I don't know for sure what he was doing there (he could have been just visiting his parents). But it seemed to me like he hoped to 'accidentally' meet me.

I haven’t seen him since then. Due to the intensity of my limerence and retraumatization, I felt too vulnerable to confront him again. I couldn't afford another trauma. So I went no contact to process my feelings, but without closure, limerence only worsened. I still don’t know why he suddenly withdrew and became cold.

After about 8 months of no contact, I messaged him wishing him Happy Holidays and offered a small present as a 'thank you' for those useful links. He didn’t reply. 

After this, despite working on myself and making progress in understanding my limerence,  I’m still struggling after almost 3 years.

I feel like my only solution is to reach out to him again. I think it's possible he didn't reply because he believed he had been 'rejected'. So this time, I want to tell him I was struggling with past trauma (without unnecessary details), and that's why I didn't contact him earlier. That I liked him back then. I want to ask him to explain his past behavior.

My main problem is timing. Again, it’s been almost 3 years, he never admitted to having feelings directly (there were only hints), and we only spoke about 5 times in total. So, it feels extremely awkward to reach out now, out of the blue, after all this time. I definitely have no intention of getting involved with someone who is already in a relationship, but I don’t see any other solution to this stupid obsession besides disclosing my feelings.

I’m also very angry at LO. Instead of dealing with whatever problems he might have had in his marriage or getting divorced, he made it my problem. Possibly tried to take advantage of my feelings. I’m suffering from limerent thoughts every single day to the point that it disrupts my concentration and sleep. I can’t date because I can only think about him. I’m wasting my life on this obsession. And he just moved on! And yet, I feel so much shame about reaching out after all this time. I endlessly hesitate and can’t decide what to do. Is it too late? I feel so stuck and tired. 

I guess I just need someone to tell me bluntly that reaching out to get closure is my only option.

anyway, this is the point of the post: i don't have the personality for a cult. i thought about it though. it's been suggested. by friends.

somebody says to me, ""i will be your disciple."" i looked in their eyes. sincere. what.

i looked at that Wild, Wild Country documentary about osho. amazing, i thought, huddled under blankets, binging it. way too lazy for it.

i've done the guru and teacher thing here on reddit. stopped because there were so many questions, and i saw how easy it is for somebody to use the student role as a crutch.

if you encounter me, interact in some meaningful way, you're headed straight to the end of the whole thing. maybe not today, or tomorrow, but you're already in line with total dissolution.

i watch it happen. i feel it. folks get swallowed up into the black hole. there's fear at first. pure existential dread, and then on the other side laughter, amazement and relief.

""has it always been this simple?"" yup.

and i love the twist of it. not insight, although that too, but how to take me. just who is this guy anyway? how arrogant. narcissist! i love it.

then some sincere seeker gets close, considers some of it, and swoop: right into the black hole of uncertainty. 

i shake my head at the soap boxing of it all. but i'll delete this post and this account like all the others. so it doesn't matter.

nothing i say ever actually matters. it's You and how you orchestrate yourself through it all. i don't have any power apart from whatever you give. not you personally of course. YOU all caps.

personally, i am utterly clueless, and lazy. so you'll never be able to follow me. i'll never start a cult. never collect disciples.

anybody who gets close enough either gets disgusted or dissolved. either you're pushed out, or drawn into Yourself.

and this is all from the first cup of coffee today. not even halfway sipped.

We had a nice, deep convo over a few days and it went sexual (she started it but I was happy to participate). She seemed nice and sweet, sent me nudes, we went to text and made a plan to meet.

We were gonna go for a walk and get coffee, but she gave me her address (bold move), so I just went over her house instead.

I had expected her to be nice and sweet, but what I found was a kinda unstable alcoholic woman. She looked like her photos but wasn't the person I imagined. She was a bit sad and maybe depressed.

But there I was in her living room, she hugged me, sat next to me.

So what did I do? The sexual build up of the prior convo was intense, so I went to make out with her. It was reciprocated. She took her shirt off. We went upstairs and had sex.

It was ok.

But now, a day later, I feel regret.

We haven't really texted, we may never again. I don't need to see her again. I don't want to reach out.

If I had met her any other way, we wouldn't have even kissed.

But she invited me over and I felt like that's why I was there, to have sex with her. And now I feel dirty.

I could have left her house instead, I should have, but I was selfish, wanted sex, who knows??

She told me she was looking for friendship/FWB and I was open before we met. Now I feel like I took advantage of her a little.",50,1745080389.0,Bumble,35,0.86,False

I worked as a contracted CSR to GFiber.a for about 1 year and 11 months ,  I will strt by saying GFiber Was amazing to work with , their protocols and polices and training methods provided were absolutely amazing, the CSR job responsibilities were not hard, we worked from home. Easy 8 hours , and  usually i cant say i like my jobs, but gfiber was soooooo easy. But gfiber had nothing to do with me being fired. My scores were top of the line , all my cx say i sound like a computer bc i talk so well. 
In Jan i was given a verbal warning for curing in google meet( proof was the closed captions) i accepted it bc i cusssed the trainer out bc she was talking to me crazy bc i didnt want her help only by the sup in the meeting and moved on, well one day in march i was given a final bc me a sup and other co workers said a few ciss words within our convo but no one else was give. One so i did not let it go , i took it to the director and head of HR, the cut me off and didnt let me say my peace as to why i think it should be a written, so i decided to tell me “ that is fine but i will sit in the chatroom day in and day out” “ screenshot every time someone cusses, and i hope it handled accordingly “ bc i knew for a fact that there has been worse thing said in there , since i said that things went left at work. While reading below, keep in mind the Sup i was in the meet breakout room alone with is the same one that would. Let me call her and cuss about other reps and laugh , the same one thats told me to go 🍃 when im aggi, same one that call me to complain about other employees lol . 

Me and my other contracted coworkers get along great , we talk in our google meets, and google chats, we make memes of each other , crack jokes , tlk a lil smack to each other etc. The tentures are based out if WV mainly and just started getting Out of State reps last 8 months or so . 

On Wed April 9th ,  2025 i was workikg my reg shift , 7am -330 pm , around 1 pm i was having some issues at work , i was on a cll with a customer and i was hving issues with thier account, thier acount was not showing any Dia for thier Fj or router, even though they were online, it would show the router info as if they had a 3rd party router. So i was using my resources provided and the person on the other side of that chat was not understanding me ( Nic agents) . So i ended that chat and went into a Verbal Google meet with the same tier resource but a different agent, one under the same Contractor. And the 3 that were im that verbal google chat, all had thier mics on and. Breathing hard but would not answer me about my questions. So i moved on to a supervisor. Lets call her kate. Kate helped me thru the call and helped me understand what was going on to help my customer and resolve his issue.  After i changed my Aux to  learning so the Time management team can see in doing some trainings , while doing them i was talking to kate and expressing life issues and frustrations. During this time i had stated sometimes i feel im over life,  over my job , over everything. Our conversation ended up ending well and she had to leave to smoke a cig and never came back . While she was gone, i ended up getting kicked out of my dialer and it wouldn’t let me log back in, while i was in the middle if working , i messaged her , and 4 other  superiors and their boss. lets call him Jacob. After 2 hours , jacob then processes to text one of the 4 sups to tell them to let me know Hr and Director will fix it in the morning but in the back of my head im like hmm tht weird bc tech stop usually fixes these kinds of things, but w.e aii so i chilled out the rest of the night, come morning at 530 am i get up make my coffee and 6 am i am in as soon as calls start coming in to go to log in and still cant, so i hit up the sup from yesterday and still same message waiting for the  director or hr 😂😂🤣🤣 so comes 830 am , i grt a call from the director saying they accept my resignation and my credentials are no longer in the system and that us why i cannot log in . 😂😂😂🤣 gurl what ??!!!!! Did i email u or hr in my dreams ? Did i submit a official notice of leave? 

So she goes on to says shes going to investigate this.  

I called and texted her from personal and work, hr, jacob , Kate, 1 other Hr member about getting back into work. No answer and was completely ignored for hours until 230 pm , i was texted by jacob to come into a Zoom meeting. I get into the zoom meeting and they told me they were firing me for stating i wanted to commit suicide, wanting to contact the dept of labor. 
Remind you that was a personal conversation i had. 

Now remind u, me and Kate talk for hours outside of work , she calls herself my mom , sometimes work mom, given me puppies. Shes always told me i can call her to cent ir if im having an issue at work wencan go into a private breakout room to talk and vent.

1k309gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eatingdisordersover30/comments/1k309gg/thought_i_was_fine_unexpected_triggers/,"thought I was fine, unexpected triggers","hey all, I’m 32. I am so happy to find this sub, so thank you all for being here and sharing. I’m so sorry this got so long, just wanted to share where people understand. No one irl to share with. Lots of triggering stuff in this post, but I followed the rules as far as I know. Please be aware of triggers in this. 

So, although I have pretty consistently struggled with disordered eating, even since getting back to a healthy weight several years ago, I’ve been mostly okay. I haven’t had a full relapse since I last recovered in my early 20s. I thought it was “over”. 

Well, I recently started nursing school. And I took anatomy and loved it, and I learned so much about how our body utilizes food as fuel, and the detriments that occur with malnutrition. Because of the stress of nursing school, while working and being a parent to a toddler, and depression/anxiety I guess, I’d started to slowly slip back into some old habits. But again… I didn’t think much of it. I just thought “hey, I’m stressed, I’ll be fine when the semester is over.”

About a week ago or so, we had our “nutrition” lecture. I thought “this is good, I’ll learn more specifics about good nutrition and why it’s good, I’ll take my health more seriously, blah blah.” Well it was triggering as fuck, yall. The entire lecture, I was white knuckling it. I knew SO MUCH about BMI, calories per gram of carb/fat/protein, stages of starvation, etc that it took me way back to my worst years with restricting and purging. And of course the lecture discussed eating disorders specifically. 

There was even a part about waist to hip ratio and measurements that indicate obesity that specifically is located in the waist (which is the kind most associated with ill health effects). 

I had been very low restricting/totally fasting for a few days leading up to that lecture, and I was visibly shaking when I picked up my coffee to drink it. My teacher asked if anyone had ever had weight loss surgery, and asked if anyone was willing to share what they had eaten throughout that day, and as people shared, I just felt physically sick. I felt like everyone could read my mind, I was just so self-conscious even though for the first time in a long time, I didn’t raise my hand to contribute to the discussion. 

On top of stress/anxiety/depression, it’s also recently the anniversary of a tragedy in my immediate family and so that doesn’t help. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m in full-blown relapse. I’ve lost a very noticeable amount in the past month and I’m back to old behavior. I won’t eat anything where I can’t find the nutrition info, getting very aggressive and angry with my spouse for pushing me to eat, only eating when I “have to” i.e., in front of my spouse so he sees that I’m eating. Lying about what I ate that day (I’m already starting to consider throwing away food to make it look like I ate it, which is obviously so shitty to do). Weighing myself every single day, in secret.

I even told myself “I’ll eat the day of my exam so that I can do well, it’ll be okay I’ve been restricting a lot” and then I got to the day of the exam… and I just couldn’t do it. I stayed fasting all day even though it’s a high stakes exam. 

I don’t know what to do, I haven’t been this deep back in it for nearly a decade. I’m worried I can’t dig myself out, and in my culture this isn’t something people discuss or generally even have any knowledge about. I know it’s bad but I can’t make myself stop. It’s like watching a car crash in slow motion. 

I don’t even know what I’m asking, I guess I just needed to share where people understand. I hope everyone is okay, and thank you for reading if you read any of it, and sorry if I bummed anyone out. ",9,1745080272.0,Eatingdisordersover30,0,1.0,False

I work in a small store inside a Walmart so we only have 2 people for opening the store, the manager that comes in at 5 am and an employee that comes in at 6 or 7am. I came in and was pulling everything out we needed, and it took about 30 minutes before the store was already slammed! Just rows of people coming. It wasn't a bus or anything people just came in droves, ordering so much food. Online orders of 16 sausage egg and cheese mcmuffins, 6 big breakfast with hotcakes. 12 griddle sandwiches and like 10 biscuits and a whole lot more I'm forgetting back to back in less than a minute apart. I was breaking a sweat constantly running back and forth. My manager was only at the front trying to make all the coffee and drinks and I had to manage making everything in the kitchen. It was non stop like that for almost all of breakfast before the switch over. The only help I got was someone else coming in at 9 am and they focused on the grill. I can't imagine what Easter day is going to be like. I already hate it enough when I have to work the kitchen by myself (i will tomorrow too because the same employee that didnt come today wont be coming tomorrow and they are my only help), it's so so so much worse when I had to also do a rush myself. 


Outside of that, I hope you guys stay strong! It's been no doubt a busy day, and probably even busier tomorrow. And I hope you guys have it a little easier than me! ",1,1745080267.0,McDonaldsEmployees,2,1.0,False

At just twenty, it felt like my life was finally getting started. I pictured myself thriving in a sleek cubicle, tapping away at a keyboard, sipping coffee like one of those women in the movies who had their lives together.

On my first day, the nerves hit me hard. But when I sat down at my desk, a voice popped over from the next cubicle.

“You must be the new girl,” she said. “I’m Kayla.”

We chatted through the partition wall while setting up our workstations, talking about commutes and favorite coffee shops. Then, in the middle of our back-and-forth, her tone shifted.

“Just a heads up,” she said, voice quieter now. “Watch out for Mr. Todd. He's… well, a sexist prick. Especially with the younger women.”

I paused, kind of taken aback. “Seriously?”

“Dead serious,” she replied. “Just… be careful.”

A few days passed before I even saw the guy. Mr. Todd. Sixty-something. Balding. Always walking around like the entire office existed because of him. One afternoon, I was eating lunch in the break room when he strolled in to grab a drink from the vending machine. He gave me a once-over, his eyes lingering in a way that made my stomach twist. I looked away quickly. He said nothing, just left.

The next morning, I was organizing files at my desk when he showed up, balancing a cup of coffee in one hand.

“Morning, Bella,” he said, setting the coffee down without asking. “How’s the new job treating you?”

“Good, thanks,” I said politely.

“I used to be in your seat once, believe it or not,” he went on. “Started back in the ‘80s when things were different. No fancy software, no remote work. You actually had to work.”

I forced a laugh, grateful when my phone rang and I had an excuse to cut the conversation short.

Later that day, I was back in my usual lunch spot when he walked in again. This time, he sat down right next to me. Uncomfortably close.

“You know, you’ve got this energy about you,” he said with a smirk. “I bet the guys in the office are already distracted.”

I laughed nervously, trying to shift the conversation. “I guess I just try to stay focused.”

“Oh, don’t be modest,” he said. “You’re the kind of girl who’ll go far… especially if you know how to play the game.”

I didn’t know what to say. Then, he shuffled closer. I glanced down and my heart stopped. He had an erection. Right there. In his slacks.

My appetite vanished. I stood up quickly. “I, uh… I should get back to work.”

He didn’t say anything. Just watched me walk out.

That afternoon, I got an email from him. *Please come to my office when you have a moment.*

My hands were shaking. Still, I went. I didn’t want to cause a scene or worse, lose my job.

“Come in, Bella,” he said smoothly, gesturing to the chair across from him.

I sat. He got up, walked over, and locked the door.

My pulse thudded in my ears.

“So,” he said casually, sitting back down. “How are you adjusting to everything? Keeping up?”

“Yeah, I think so,” I said, fidgeting with my hands. “Still learning, but it’s going well.”

He kicked off a shoe under the desk. A moment later, I felt it his foot brushing against my leg. I froze.

“I should probably get back to work,” I said quickly.

“Relax,” he said. “It’s okay to take a breather. Why don’t you take your shoes off too?”

I hesitated.

“Come on,” he said. “I don’t bite.”

Against every ounce of instinct, I slipped off my flats.

“Are you single, Bella?”

I shook my head. “No, I’m not.”

He leaned forward. “You ever think about making a little extra money on the side?”

I blinked. “Uh… maybe. Depends.”

He rubbed his hands together like some cartoon villain. “This stays in here, alright? Just between us.”

“…Okay,” I said, my voice barely audible. My gut was screaming at me to get out.

“I’ll give you $600 every two weeks. All I want is a few pictures of your feet. That’s it.”

I stared at him, completely stunned. Then I stood up so fast the chair scraped against the floor.

“This is incredibly inappropriate. You need to stop right now.”

He frowned. “You can leave.”

And I did stormed out, heart racing, hands shaking.

Since then, he’s been colder than ice. Nitpicking everything I do. Sending vague, passive aggressive emails. It’s like he’s waiting for me to crack.

Now I’m stuck here, second guessing every move I make. I worked so hard to get here… but this?

I don’t know if I should quit this job is really good money!",0,1745080249.0,office,25,0.24,False

1k308yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k308yg/dating_my_sisters_classmate/,Dating my sister's classmate,"Hi there. For context I am 24 (F) and my sister is 21. I don't want to overwhelm my friends with this heavyness on my heart and I need to see a strangers POV. 

Basically my sister is in med school. I'm also in the medical field myself. A couple days ago, I ran into her accidentally at a happy hour event which I didn't know she was attending. She was with her classmates, which one of them showed interest in me. He started talking to me and asking questions about me and asked me out for coffee after the event, which I declined because I was tired, but he took my number and said he will plan something when I finish school which is next week. I accepted. He's a very respectful, kind & intelligent man. He comes from a good background and is someone I could be interested in. He checks all my boxes. 

The next morning I went to see my sister and I asked her about her classmate who approached me the day before. She looked at me and said ""why are you asking me this? You're not interested in him are you?"" And I told her I might be. She then told me he was off limits because he's in her class and that could have an impact on her reputation and future career of a doctor if me and him don't work out or something bad happens between me and him. I told her it was weird and selfish of her and she started getting so mad at me, telling me I'm only causing her problems and she slammed the door on me. She called my mom, who called me right after, screaming at the top of her lungs telling me to stay away from my sister and her classmates and that the man in question only wants to have fun with me because of the way I was dressed and basically implying that I'm a sl**t. I was wearing a bodycon white long dress, I am naturally a curvy woman so naturally dresses look sexy on me but in my opinion it wasn't too much (according to my very honest friends also). This broke my heart, I didn't understand why they were being so mean to me. My sister then cancelled a ticket I had with her to go to her school's event which cost 150$ because she wants me to stay away from her classmates. She told me I was not her sister anymore and my mom backed her up. To keep the peace, I told her I had erased his number, but she still didn't care and doesn't consider me as her sister anymore. I didn't erase his number and I accepted a date with him very soon as I'm interested in getting to know him. 

I want to mention that my sister was interested in this man last year. He never made a move on her so she moved on. I feel like this is important information. Also, my sister is closer to my mom. My mom has a control issue and in her head knows best and she doesnt want us to make defisions without consulting her. My sister has a closer relationship with her because she listens to my mom which is not a bad thing. But I was always more of a rebel (not in a crazy way)

To you strangers, it might be obvious what's going on there, but to me I am deeply hurt from the treatment I received and I can't see clearly how to act in this situation. Now my sister isn't talking to me and she blocked me everywhere, same from my mother. My heart is heavy. 

My question is do you think her concerns are legitimate? What should I do ? How can I protect myself?

1k3041i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k3041i,Things that might even outlive me.,"Although I try to subscribe to a minimalist lifestyle, I’m not living out of a backpack with a single cup and two T-shirts. My version has room for well-made things - items that serve a purpose and are a pleasure to use. 

I like objects that earn their place, and they usually come from independent craftspeople or companies that still care about how things are made.

Good kitchen tools, quality clothes, solid furniture - they help shape my environment. I don’t need a lot of them, but I do want them to be right.

And with that, (for me anyway), there’s more reason to buy things that last, things that might even outlive me.

A few years ago, I cracked two of my Cornish Blue coffee mugs. They were favourites - not expensive, but familiar. The original factory was just down the road from my grandparents’ house in Derbyshire, England.  

Although their kitchen shelves held the brown, no-nonsense Parsons ware - sturdy, functional, and very “Northern serious,” - I’d always preferred the blue and white stripes of Cornish Blue. It felt brighter and reminded me of sunshine and toast.

So, I held on to the broken pieces without a plan, just a hunch that they weren’t done yet. 

Recently, my wife had them Kintsugi'd.

As we know, kintsugi doesn’t try to hide the break. It highlights it. The repair becomes part of the story, not an imperfection to expunge. 

It’s an important gesture to acknowledge the damage, to take time fixing it properly, and to let the result be something different, maybe even better.

That kind of thinking feels useful these days. Not everything needs to be replaced. Some things are worth holding onto, even after they’ve cracked.

Maybe especially then.

**Black coffee** is one of the most consumed beverages in the world—not just for its rich flavor and energy-boosting properties, but also for its growing reputation as a natural aid for weight loss and metabolic health. But how much of that is backed by science, and how much is just hype?

At [gomehedi.com](https://gomehedi.com), we’ve explored the scientific research, real-life experiences, and expert opinions to provide you with a clear, trustworthy answer. Let’s dive into the facts.

 

# ☕ The Science Behind Black Coffee and Weight Loss

# ✅ 1. Low in Calories

Black coffee contains **virtually no calories**—only 1 to 2 calories per cup, depending on brewing method. This makes it ideal for weight loss diets, especially when compared to sugar-loaded lattes or cream-based beverages.

**Stat:** According to the USDA, a standard 8-ounce cup of black coffee contains **only 2 calories** with no sugar or fat.

 

# ✅ 2. Boosts Metabolism Naturally

Black coffee is rich in **caffeine**, which stimulates the **central nervous system** and can increase your **metabolic rate**—helping your body burn more calories even while resting.

**Expert Insight:** Dr. Kris Gunnars, a nutrition researcher, explains,“Caffeine can increase your resting metabolic rate by 3–11%. The higher your metabolism, the easier it is to lose weight.”

**Study Reference:** A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that **caffeine increased energy expenditure by up to 13%** in lean individuals.

 

# ✅ 3. Enhances Physical Performance

Caffeine stimulates adrenaline release, which prepares your body for intense physical activity. This can help you **work out harder and longer**, ultimately leading to **greater fat burn**.

**Stat:** According to a meta-analysis in Sports Medicine, caffeine intake before exercise can improve performance by **11-12%**.

 

# ✅ 4. Appetite Suppression

Black coffee may temporarily suppress hunger due to caffeine’s effect on **ghrelin**, the hunger hormone. This makes it easier to stick to your calorie goals.

**User Review:**“I drink a cup of black coffee every morning before my intermittent fasting window ends. It helps suppress my appetite until lunchtime and keeps me energized. I’ve lost 18 pounds in 3 months!” – Jenny M., verified user on [gomehedi.com](http://gomehedi.com)

 

# ✅ 5. Improves Insulin Sensitivity

Black coffee may improve **insulin sensitivity**, which helps regulate blood sugar and reduce fat storage.

\*\*Expert Quote:\*\*Dr. Rob van Dam, Professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, notes:“Long-term coffee consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, which links directly to better weight regulation.”

Bad etiquette, cheapness or bridezilla?","I’m part of a bridal party and was asked to be apart of it last summer. I am the only one who is married in the group and has had a large wedding in a HCOL city. Our court was wasn’t the largest, maybe 6 total but all in all we footed the bill for their attire, hotel rooms (some travelled)…my husband even drove two hours to pick up his best man for the dinner rehearsal the day prior. We didn’t expect gifts from them or even had a shower, bachelor party etc. no pre wedding events. We even gifted them gifts for being with us the day of. My MOH treated me to a spa day and I actually gave her a facial treatment certificate for a different day. I understand this is all probably just us being generous and out of ordinary. When asked to be part of this bridal party I asked upfront for costs and what she expected of me. She said “oh nothing! Just help me plan! We actually won’t do an engagement party because it is too expensive etc”. So we left it at that.

Fast forward we are mere months away from the fall wedding and I see now we are expected to drop over 2k in the span of the summer months for this wedding and I keep asking and she keeps dodging my questions. Right now we are required monthly to meet for brunch or coffee to discuss her wedding. I took offense to this because she is always too busy to hang one on one as friends and discuss our lives but I digress. It turns out, she is now having an engagement party and wants it a rooftop bar or restaurant…. Around twenty of us so we can all meet. She said they’d pay for appetizers but if we want drinks or dinner that’s on us. I’m sorry we are invited to celebrate you two years after the fact of your engagement and we have to pay for the privilege to celebrate you? How are we going to split the bill when there is already a 30% percent gratuity include just for having such a large party.  Hubs and I thought that was tacky. 

Their wedding is already in the middle of the week in a far away city no one lives in because it was more affordable. The rehearsal is in the morning the day before and now people are expected to take three days off for this wedding, drive and pay for lodging. And she was insistent on not having a dinner rehearsal as a thank you because it is expensive. But she has gotten lipo for her wedding. She sends us beautiful inspo photos for her bridal shower that she expects us to pay for (not her extended family) and I am the only one  that is financially better off. There is a 19 year old college girl for crying out loud. The rest have kids.  I’m confused on the bridal shower too because there is no registry…she only has activities for her honeymoon which I also was taken aback by…they don’t plan to move out so a registry won’t make sense but a shower is for gifts and guests will be expected to take something and it feels more like a cash grab. 
Which is a bit more disappointing because I know she paid thousands of dollars for arm lipo etc for her own wedding (power to her but feels off in context of her being cheap with everything else).

What drove the nail in the coffin for me was during the last meeting I was not able to attend, my things were offered for the wedding. 
We (hubs and I) have a few family boats we regularly use in different cities. Like two hours away. These are full on live aboard boats.. rooms…kitchens..bathrooms…etc. when he is gone I usually go away to these just to sleep and relax and enjoy a new city. I do not take them out of the marina and drive them. Ideally you need a little staff or more than one person to do that. I’m no professional lol. I saw a link to a tiktok of the best cities to have a bachelorette in the groupchat…and one of the cities where we have a boat was on there. It is an incredibly expensive city and actually sleepy, it’s definitely not Vegas. And I have never heard them mention anything of it before. The bride sent me a voice memo updating me asking me to host the bachelorette on one the boats. And they went ahead and started planning a spa day in that city. I have not replied. I am completely dumbfounded. I feel blindsided and like a cash cow. The dates for all these pre wedding activities have been pre set monthly and I mentioned to her last year I will be in Europe for the whole month of May. She has failed to ask me about anything outside of the wedding and been too busy to see me so it hasnt come up. 

I feel it’s very easy to see us as childfree (for now but hopefully not soon!) and better off but it comes off as entitlement for us to foot most of these things because of it. The other bridesmaids have not offered anything. I can chalk some of these up to bad etiquette or ignorance but part of me sees it as cheap or a cash grab once she saw how expensive a wedding is. I told her upfront what we spent and she should budget and have the wedding they could afford. They both work minimum wage jobs while my husband and I both had careers ( I am now a housewife) so it is a bit different. There is nothing wrong with having a small quaint wedding without all the bells and whistle you see on IG but I think it falls on deaf ears. How do I approach all of this? Is it bad etiquette, cheapness, being a bridezilla? I am thinking of stepping down.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the replies. I wasn’t expecting to get as much traction as it did and might delete later because I feel it is oddly specific. But I decided to lift the rose colored glasses and gracefully bow out with my reasoning being I cannot give her wedding the time or attention it deserves as my life is picking up. Thank you all once more!!! ",70,1745079616.0,bridezillas,56,0.94,False

He is whiney, arrogant, immature, and has a quick temper. For my whole life, I've dealt with this kind of behavior from him, and I am SICK of it. Especially because there isn't much I can do at the moment.

We live on a ranch, it isn't ours it's a family members, and we have lived there for the past year BECAUSE of my father's ill-temper. He lost his last job (and got us evicted from our home) all because of his stupid pride. He didn't want anyone else to drive him around, which is so fucking stupid that he lost his temper over something so ridiculously small. Now, I am at a place where I have zero friends and I am miles away from my girlfriend and best friend. 

Anyway, I can't really leave 
because I don't have an ID or driver's license (I do know how to drive). I'm also staying for my mother's sake because it's just as hard on her (if not more) as it is on me.

He cries and moans about every little thing: 
 ""oh, I'm starving"" - there is food in the house, he just refuses to cook for himself

""oh, I'm in so much pain"" - he refuses to go to the hospital for his issues that are mainly self-inflicted

""oh, nothing ever works for me!"" - he gets angry as soon as things don't go his way and decides the world is against him

""THIS IS ALL GOD'S FAULT!"" - I'm not even a Christian, but to blame someone other than yourself is so dumb. Own up to it

""why isn't there any coffee made?"" - you can make it yourself, sir, no one in this house is your servant

I want to feel for him, but I literally can't when this is behavior is so common! He literally got mad at me just a few days ago because he wanted a hot meal and I didn't immediately jump to his aid,and so, he gave the the cold shoulder for the rest of the night. I cook for him often, if not almost every damn day. I HANDWASH his laundry (we have no washing machine atm). I clean up after his messes. I do a lot for the man, needless to say. And whenever someone tries to say something about his mishaps, he likes to get all jokey as if it isn't a big deal. As if what we said doesn't matter.


I'm just so tired of his attitude. Of him acting as if people need to cater to his every whim, of him treating people like shit whenever he isn't feeling well, of him being just a major A-hole for nothing. We've talked to him about his behavior and told him how anxious it makes us, and ill give it to him, he has calmed down considerably, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a monthly occurrence. He whines, yells, punches holes in walls, and it SUCKS! Of course it could be worse, he could lay hands on us and I am grateful that he doesn't, but it STILL doesn't change the fact that his yelling causes issues within the household.

Everytime I think about him getting irate, my chest tightens and hurts. Hell, I'm getting shakey even writing this. As much as I love him, it's hard to do so at times. I just wish he'd grow up and realize that the world doesn't revolve around him. I get his childhood was hard and it it most definitely impacted him to be the way he is today, but goddamn dude.

He invited me for coffee, but I had plans that day and then I was heading out of town for a work trip the next day. My plans ended up getting cancelled, so I messaged him if the offer was still open I'd like to meet up. He didn't reply that day, so I moved on. He did end up replying the next day apologizing. We ended up talking every night that I was out of town. I come back, and messaged him asking if he wanted to get together. He agreed, but said he lent out his truck to a buddy and would have to see when he would be getting it back. We get a time narrowed down, location picked. Something happened with buddy and the truck, so I got a play by play of that and that he wasn't going to make it. It's a pretty specific story that I feel would have been hard to make up. So, I kind of let that one slide. 

We did end up making plans for yesterday, with a time and location as well. I texted to confirm we were still on, we were, but he pushed out the time by 15 mins.

she shoves me off of her and throws me on the ground again, and i scraped my elbow. she tries to choke herself again. this time i accidentally scratched her neck. i didnt mean to. she was just repeatedly telling me she wanted to kill herself and i wasnt just gonna let her choke herself next to me. i feel so terrible and im so scared shes gonna go to the cops. i deserve it but still, im only 18, i just want to live the rest of my life. i didnt mean to make such a huge mistake. i was just trying to help all morning and get her to stop.

she left for work, but followed me to my car first and told me to take back me saying 'i hope work goes by fast i love you' or she would kill herself. i did it once and she said great so you dont love me. i said no i just said it so you dont die. she proceeds to sit in my car and tell me shes not leaving until i say i dont love her or shes crashing her car. im just so fed up at the point that i just sit and cry. she eventually walks away and drives off.

No coffee, no energy drinks, no pre-workout, no chocolate, not even green tea. My daily routine was a double expresso shot in the mornings and day filled with cokes. My caffeine intake started at a very young age. I would say around 10 years old. I remember My grandma would always give me a cup of coffee every so often. to be honest, I can't remember a time where I was not drinking some sort of caffeinated beverage. So I would say my life in the caffeinated world has been around 30 years. Quitting wasn’t easy—in fact, the first few months were brutal—but I can confidently say now: it was one of the hardest things I've done for sure but also one of the best decisions I’ve ever made for my health, my mind, and my life.

The Withdrawals Were Real

For the first few months, I felt like I was dragging myself through mud. Headaches that felt like hangovers. Constant fatigue. Joint pain. Nerve pain. TMJ. Restless leg. Mood swings. Brain fog that made me forget why I even started. Depersonalization. Memory loss. Nasty energy crash. Constant tiredness. Insomnia. IBS. Waking every few hours to pee at night. Anger. Blurry vision. Night sweats. Brittle finger nails. Bad breathe. Loss in libido. BO. It seemed as tho for the first few months I would take two steps forward and five back. Looking back now, I would say about 90% of these symptoms I probably had my whole life. I just never realized it because caffeine numbed my world.

Little by little each symptom would fade in and out to completely gone. Around Month 5, Something Shifted

That fifth month was a turning point. It was subtle at first—deeper sleep, fewer anxiety spikes—but then everything started clicking. I started feeling feelings again. Emotions hit with more clarity—not in an overwhelming way, but in a way that felt real and grounded. My thinking sharpened. The fog lifted. I stopped bouncing from high to crash and instead coasted through my days with mental clarity. For the first time in in decades. I started waking up feeling rested. My sleep cycles smoothed out. No more 2 a.m. wakeups. No more restless legs or shallow sleep. I tracked my journey with whoop and have been seeing a positive trend in all my numbers. Resting Heart Rate Dropped. Caffeine keeps the sympathetic nervous system fired up. Without it, my resting heart rate dropped significantly—showing that my body was no longer constantly on high alert. My HRV Increased ( something that I believe is a great marker in showing stress in both the mental and physical) My heart rate variability started climbing little by little. I was always between 25 and 30 HRV for years. Now I'm anywhere from 40 all the way to 55. I never was able to get past 50 in the five years I've had whoop.  It was as if my body could finally relax and recover. Higher HRV = lower stress, better recovery. 

I was constantly on this sub, in the background, following everybody else's journey. You all helped me get through some really dark days. I kept searching for reassurance in everybody else's story. I had to trust the process and know that there was light at the end of the tunnel. The person I was becoming was a real me.  To say my life has changed in a complete 180 is an understatement. Quitting caffeine has also helped me with other addictions. The biggest one being a porn addict. I struggled with that for years and years and even was in SA. I could never stay sober more than a month. Now I'm also six months sober from it. I attributed to caffeine.  I also quit sugar and drinking to add a few. I can tshort circuit negative feedback loops, and stop negative thoughts that lead to my addictions.    There's a lot of us in this sub that are hurting and suffering and all I can say is...just believe. You will be OK. In my heart of hearts, I know that and so should you. Here's a mantra that I said to myself every single day. Especially When I would get a withdrawal that I couldn't take...

Caffeine isn't pleasure. It's a trap design too keep me weak, empty, and controlled",13,1745079379.0,decaf,1,0.94,False

I feel as though applying on these websites where you just put your resume in is borderline a waste of time because of how competitive some of these positions are. I get the feeling that reaching out with humility to experienced water professionals in my area, either over coffee or Zoom, and asking about their work, explaining my goals, and getting referrals to other colleagues who may be looking for undergrads, is the most effective way to get a position in the job market today. I’m curious to hear people’s thoughts and stories on if I’m getting this right or not. ",2,1745079351.0,Environmental_Careers,1,1.0,False

I’ve never had this bad of constipation in my entire life. Took two doses of Exlax and a cup of coffee to get me moving.

I will say the food is probably one of my favorite parts of pregnancy so far. Other than seeing my child on ultrasounds. But food has never been so good and hit the spot so well. Right now I am eating laughing, cow cheese, and Ritz crackers and it is so delicious. This is probably one of the best perks of pregnancy cause it’s just so satisfying to eat. My husband is also caving into some of my cravings already. I wanted macaroni and cheese with shapes the other night and he went out and got them!

I've been looking for many years for an animation that I watched with my cousin, it was an animation from the 90s in which a boy was in front of the computer, laughing several times, while day and night passed through the next window. In those moments, the days appeared when he was already there, and his health was getting worse. There comes a time when he is already drinking coffee through the serum. The last part where he's inside the coffin still laughing and something is on top of him like a little worm. It was just a video with no possibility of interacting. Would anyone know the name or remember him? Thank you!",0,1745079265.0,tipofmytongue,2,0.5,False
