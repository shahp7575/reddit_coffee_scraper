1jpbz9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1jpbz9p/if_it_doesnt_spark_joy/,If it doesn't spark joy...,"When I got my first handheld for emulating retro games I did, what I think a lot of people do when starting out - I got a device w/ a card that came pre-loaded with thousands upon thousands of games.

Due to laziness on my side, the content on that one card has been carried over to be used on a number of devices as I acquired them. Some devices got some games added...but 90% of the games were from that same initial mega-batch of games I most likely would never play.

SO...fast-forward to this past weekend and week where I found myself with some spare time.

I loaded up some coffee and got to work. After several hours - split over a day or two - I had ended up deleting about 95% of all games. My launcher/front-end looked so much more 'curated' and reflected the type of gamer **I** am. I might not have 12,000 games to pick from right now - but I have maybe 6-700 games that I like and/or games that I am genuinely curious about one day checking out.

One could easily argue *""Well, in that case just start with a blank card and build from that""*  \- which is a valid point but I found myself rather enjoying going through all these games and 'discovered' quite a few that I backlisted for 'maybe play some day'. This way I already had the game and didn't have to download it.

Long story short - maybe take some time and weed your game collection if having a more clean and relevant library is appealing to you :)

Anyone done something similar?

Last year, I successfully deleted Facebook, and honestly, I haven’t missed it. Now, I’m focusing on Instagram and TikTok. I want to use technology as a tool, and shift towards a more analog lifestyle.

I spent my entire childhood and teenage years without the internet, and I didn’t get my first iPhone until my 30s. Maybe it’s the nostalgia talking, but I remember life feeling richer and more satisfying before I had the internet in my pocket. Now, I want to recapture some of that.

So far, I’ve deleted most apps besides utilities. I kept banking apps and a two-factor authentication app I need for work. It’s been a few days, and now I’m focusing on replacing some tech with analog alternatives:

Notes app → Switched to a notebook

New apps → Subscribed to the Sunday paper

Libby/Kindle → Dug out my library card and started reading physical books

My current struggle is figuring out what to do with my mornings. The usual advice is to get out of bed right away, meditate, exercise, eat breakfast, shower, etc. But for me, that feels like too much action. I really enjoy a slow, lazy morning. I’ll wake up earlier just to lay around in bed longer.

My typical routine is drinking coffee in bed while my cat snuggles my legs under the blanket, scrolling through TikTok. I’ll do this for at least an hour before I actually get up to exercise, eat, get ready for work, etc. And I LOVE it. It’s my favorite part of the day—the slow, cozy pace of it all.

The problem now is that I want to keep this slow, cozy morning routine, but without the tech. So I’m looking for ideas. What do you do in the morning? What can I do to entertain myself during that slow, lazy time while I drink my coffee under the covers—without the temptation of social media?

1jpbw60,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jpbw60/advice_for_our_dynamic_me_24m_and_her_24f_feeling/,"Advice for our dynamic, me (24M) and her (24F) - feeling unsure. Is there something here?","I (24M) have recently started seeing someone (24f) casually with the intention of dating, but I'm not sure what our dynamic is at the moment and wonder what people think. 

So I and her have known each other via a uni society (both post-grads) for the last 6 months on and off but in the last 4 weeks have become a lot closer.   
It began after my housemate (21F) noticed when we were out she would always sit next to me or strike up conversation with me.   
This led me to invite her out for group drinks with my house, which she came to. We both got very drunk and ended up both sleeping in my bed - nothing happened between us but spooning. We woke up awkwardly the next morning, but then I invited her back round again and she agreed. She came round and we both got drunk again, but before we got really drunk, we had a long conversation about how we felt about each other and our fears and how she didn't want to have sex as we didnt really know each other that well. That suited me fine as im the same. I also said just please dont lead me on and if youre not feeling it, say something. Dont let me do dating stuff with you to be told 4 weeks down the line you think its platonic - which I think is fair.   
Anyway, the week after that we start seeing each other more, going out for coffee, going out for car rides and she came out again for drinks with my flatmate. We've been out for dinner and gone out to do stuff together as just us two but never explicitly called it a 'date'. After dinner recently was the first time we held hands (prompted by me), for which I apologised for as I thought it was too forwards, but she said it was nice and took it back.   
  
She now comes round pretty consistently, 2-3 times a week and she stays over and we get up and make breakfast with each other, go shopping, play xbox etc and just generally chill. We both sleep in my bed and spoon at night with her usually falling asleep on me. We have a long list of stuff we want to do together and have a film list etc, so loads of plans for the future.  We seem to be getting closer as time goes on. 

Now, my hesitations are that I am often the one who is more physical and will instigate hugs, hand holding etc, which throws me off a bit, but she said shes happy. Secondly we haven't had sex or kissed which we said was fine as we were taking it slow, but after a pretty unhelpful conversation with my best friend, feel really insecure about this now. He really offset me and I now feel quite uneasy about it all. Lastly, as we aren't officially 'dating' or in a relationship, its really hard to describe our dynamic to people, including myself. Or, maybe we are just sort of dating in our own weird way. She is just fast becoming one of my best friends and its hard to describe it without it sounding platonic. Essentially I just worry that I am reading into it too much and that my feelings aren't mutual. I just don't want to get hurt. Being around her lights up my day and I really hope something comes of it.

1jpbrzk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpbrzk,My March 2025 Low Buy Results,"Hi, everyone! At the beginning of March, I decided to start a Low Buy year. I noticed movements like No Buy and Project Pan gaining traction at the beginning of 2025. I supported them and thought they were interesting, but I didn’t stop to think about and research them until the end of February. So that’s why I’ve had a bit of a late start, but it’s never too late to begin! To be honest, though, a No Buy challenge sounded daunting, so I started off with a Low Buy instead. But I’d like to transition to a No Buy eventually, when I feel like the time is right.

What motivates me is the idea of reducing clutter, having less of an impact on the environment, and boycotting the US economy as an American. I wouldn’t call myself a shopping addict, but being socialized as a woman, I’d get dopamine rushes from finding the next best thing and having certain possessions that help establish my identity. For example, I love fashion, so one of the hardest things for me to give up shopping for is clothing. The same goes for art supplies, as someone who loves dabbling in different creative activities. But I have plenty of clothes and art supplies, so why do I need to chase for more? I want to be content with what I have, and save space in my house.

I came up with a traffic light system that states which items or services are alright for me to buy. Green light means go for it, which applies to essentials like groceries and gas. Yellow light means yield or proceed with caution, which applies to acceptable non-essentials, like going out to eat or buying gifts for others (I don’t do these things too often anyway). Lastly, red light means stop, so be careful with frivolous items like clothes, art supplies, and makeup.

I was completely honest in tracking my spending this month. So I was shocked to see that I spent $630 for the month of March. It just feels like a lot for one person. I definitely had some slip-ups, especially since I took a beach trip in the middle of the month. I was also hoping to keep up with the green light streak that I started on the 17th, all the way until the end of the month. But I caved in by getting coffee and going thrifting the last 2 days of March.

Do I regret my spending this month, though? No, because this is only the beginning, and it’s counterproductive to beat myself up. I’ve actually been using the yellow and red light items I bought (I haven’t touched one of the new coloring books yet, though). And I was able to resist some unnecessary purchases, which saved me from spending an extra $78-$108 this month. Also, I hung out at the park with loved ones several times throughout March. Before, I’d never do this and mostly defaulted to going out to eat and thrifting, since that’s what they also like to do. It felt different spending time with them in this way—more enriching than splitting up at the store and losing out on precious time being together.

Going forward, what do I want to do differently in April? I’d love more days at the park for sure. I think it’d be smart to seek out cheaper alternatives for items too. For example, I spent $7 on a bottle of teriyaki sauce at the grocery store the other day. I was surprised, but I bought it anyway since I knew it was good—and I had had a long day, so I was ready to go home. But in the future, I could find a less expensive bottle of teriyaki sauce, look for a new grocery store, or just make it myself. I still live at home, but I’m planning to move out with my partner soon. If $630 a month sounds like a lot to me, that number is only going to become more outrageous when I start paying for rent and utilities. So it’s good that I’m beginning to be more mindful of where my money goes.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! How did March go for you guys?",3,1743554634.0,nobuy,1,1.0,False

-

’Twas the night before tariffs, and all through the Street,
The traders were anxious, all glued to their seats.
Their orders were placed with precision and care,
In hopes that the White House would choose to play fair.

The bulls clutched their charts, their bets running high,
While bears rubbed their hands, expecting a dive.
And I with my laptop, a coffee in tow,
Refreshed every headline, awaiting the blow.

When out on the tape there arose such a clatter,
I sprang to my screen to see what was the matter.
Away to my Bloomberg, I clicked with a flash,
Skimmed through the news, prepared for a crash.

The headlines declared in big, flashing red,
“Tariffs confirmed!”—my stomach felt dread.
Steel and aluminum, twenty-five strong,
With autos and tech not far along.

China, the EU, and Canada too,
All in the crosshairs—what else is new?
No deals, no breaks, no truce left in sight,
Just markets in turmoil and fear overnight.

Then what to my weary eyes should appear,
But Powell himself with a smirk ear to ear.
He lifted his mic and cleared out his throat,
Then gave us a speech with a familiar note.

“The economy’s strong, inflation runs high,
Rate cuts are coming, but don’t ask me why.
Tariffs may hit, but markets will fight,
Just buy the damn dip and you’ll be alright.”

And just like that, the futures turned green,
Traders rejoiced—it felt like a dream!
I sighed as I watched, for deep down I knew,
That Powell and tariffs were playing us too.

So I logged out my screen and turned off the light,
“Happy trading to all, and to all—hedge it right!”",79,1743554467.0,wallstreetbets,14,0.94,False

On the way to drop my friend off, I noticed a car behind me aggressively overtaking and cutting off other vehicles. He quickly caught up, lined up beside me, and tried to force me out of my lane. Since there was a car to my right, I had no choice but to brake to avoid a collision. As he forced his way in, he clipped my front bumper and then sped off.

I chased after him he repeatedly brake-checked me and even tried to push me off the road. Eventually, I caught up to him at a red light, where he was stuck behind other cars. I got out, walked up to his window, and knocked while my friend was on the phone with the police.

That’s when things escalated—he reached for a gun. The moment I saw that, I noped out of there and walked back to my car. As I neared the back of his car, I suddenly heard him slam into reverse. Reacting instinctively, I swung and punched his rear windshield, cracking it, he stopped I got into my car and he briefly tailed us before splitting off while my friend finished the call with the police, giving them his direction.

Now, here’s where I messed up—I did tell my friend about the gun while he was still on the phone, but I didn't tell him to mention it to the police. Doesn't really matter much given how the legal system works here, the fact that it wasn't pointed at me means it likely wouldn’t be considered in the case. If he got my license plate and reports the incident it could lead to court, this could easily turn into a situation where we’re just paying for each other’s damages.

Edit: For anyone wondering why didn't I just report his licence plate to the police for a hit and run, unless there's video evidence or the cops catch them right after the hit and run, nothing is going to be done about it.",0,1743554354.0,tifu,4,0.36,False

I wish every time he seasons his eggs, he accidentally adds just a bit too much salt—never enough to stop eating, just enough to regret every bite.

- Ryan woke up on base and immediately went to grab the cup of coffee next to his bunk it wasn't hot or even lukewarm but he enjoyed coffee and that's what got him through most of the day.
 he had joined the communication program although he was not allowed to talk about the jeagers due to the fact that the government wasn't really sure how the venlil would react to presumed predators with giant war machines bigger than buildings.
 along with the fact that he was extremely bored due to the low breach activity and no Kaiju is coming through in over 4 months.
He decided to grab his holo pad and try talking 

              
        Ryan:""Hi my name is Ryan""

                                   talta: ""Well what do you do for work""

- Ryan paused for a few seconds questioning himself on how to respond knowing that he was not supposed to talk about his job so he decided to give a vague description 

Ryan:""well I am a pilot..... How about you where do you work""
                                        
                                  Talta:""actually I work in my opinion one of the best jobs I'm a librarian actually you probably don't know what a library is basically it's a place where we store books""


Ryan:""no I know what a library is and we have plenty of them on Earth""

 POV:Talta
*Ha! The predators having books that's laughable I bet the predator barely knows how to read but alone knows about books I think I'll test them*

                                 Talta: ""so what exactly is your favorite kind of book Ryan?""

Ryan: ""Try not to laugh but I and pretty partial to romance novels""

                                             Talta:""......ok that's. Nice""

Ryan:""hey I'm sorry I got to go to work I'll talk to you later""

                                Talta:""okay talk to you later I...guess""


- The communication link shut off after Ryan closed out Talta was very much confused about the situation having her expectation dropped and trounced upon. 
 not really knowing how to react a little while later she finished eating her breakfast and went to work at the library it was a boring day as usual which she liked.

- 2 claws later
while she was working at the front desk taking inventory of the books that were borrowed someone who was familiar but not say enjoyable site came to the front desk it was a venlil named Marlo he had continuously made advances on her which she continuously shut down. 

Marlo:""hello my great friend how are you doing this fine day""

                  Talta:""well I was doing fine what do you want""

Marlo:""Well I wanted to make you aware that I have just joined the exterminators as a junior exterminator""

- He tapped his claws against the front desk with a smug look on his face. Sometimes she thought about reporting him for predator disease but always thought against it because of her morals she knew he possibly would not have predator disease and would be released a day after but it would inconvenience him which would be worth it enough. 

                             Talta:""and why would I care about that?""

Marlo:""because it means I'm moving up in the world of course""

                                   Talta:""well how about you move up on those books you haven't returned yet""
- She rolled her eyes at him somewhat tired of his antics.He scoffed and walked away flicking his tail at her in irritation.
Later on after she finished work and went home on her walk she still wondered about the human remembering that he said he was a pilot but didn't say what kind of pilot he was did he pilot that he see vessel a ship maybe something else? She would have to ask him tomorrow in the morning as it seems he was only available in the morning. Or maybe he just felt he had better things to do. Either way she wanted to ask.
And maybe in a few months she would actually get to meet Ryan and even more about the human.

It's 3:30 am and I can't sleep. I don't know why I can't. I've been up since 6 am yesterday - I should be tired. I only had one cup of coffee today, no other caffeine, and I hardly consumed any sugar or carbs.  Why won't my mind ever stop? Days like today are so exhausting. 

The therapist I've had for over a decade is no longer my therapist. Thanks to the current administration, she felt she had no other option but to move her family back to Colombia. She's a dual citizen, but her husband is not, and I don't blame her at all. I think she made the right decision, it just sucks for me and her other patients, and anyone else whose life will be emptier without her.

Now is a time I probably *should* talk to someone, but that also means starting over completely … I don't have the energy for that. I had a really good relationship with Inez, she *got* me, and I truly never felt judged, even when she would point out my mistakes or wrongdoing, she was always gentle in her rightful criticism - that's not easy to find in a therapist, or in people in general. I know that I was lucky, and she was definitely there when I needed it most, and I learned a lot from her. I'm doing my best to rely on that. By now I *should* have all of the tools I need to face any challenge …

But should is a tyrant, always assigning blame. You should do this, you shouldn't do that … says who? Think about it, how often is it your own voice? When you hear that voice in your mind telling what you should or shouldn't do, how often is it yours? In my case, I know it's almost never. But it's also not normally a voice I can place, maybe it's more an amalgamation of voices … be a lot cooler if it sounded like Darth Vader though. The James Earl Jones Darth Vader, obvi. 

It's 3:51 now, and I think I'm feeling a tinge sleepy … I'm going to take advantage, and ride this wave if I can … all the way to the shores of some far off land, where love never leaves and no one needs therapy. I'll meet you there 💜 sans Darth Vader voices (unless you're into that). 

p.s. pls don't ask why I write these like I'm talking to someone else, I don't understand it either. Maybe out of habit because I used to share them? Idk, I know no one reads them now, but I still write the same … 

Anyshit, g'night.

I didn’t feel the need too. 
My friend is someone I’ve known since kindergarten, we went to every school together, stayed at houses. We are 24 now. 
She went through a terrible loss at 18 when her husband committed suicide, and a year later both her grandparents who raised her died within 6 months of eachother. 
She moved about 45 mins from me but we would always see eachother on the weekends, drink, have fun. But the depression was weighing on her far more than any help I could offer her. I answered every phone call, every text, face time for hours. 

I noticed we started getting more distant memories nice we hit our 20’s.

I had an ex in middle school and dated this boy for 3 years. We broke it off. She started seeing him and because of this she stopped having me around. He is a drug user. (Fent/meth). 

I confronted her about it because obviously you wouldn’t think your best friend would ever go for someone you were with, and she denied. Later on fully admitting to me that they were in a serious relationship. I wasn’t happy about it obviously (girl code not lingering feelings) and then I let it go and wished them well, told her I loved her and hoped they were happy. 

She started losing weight relatively fast after they started dating, I mean.. 150 pounds in a year (she gave me the numbers). And I started to worry, not ever thinking that she would start using because that’s “not who she is” “that’s my friend! She would never” 

She has since then lost all power, water, is on the brink of being homeless, living with him, no job, her child from her previous marriage had gotten taken away from cps, etc. 

I was on phone with her, and I was feeling optimistic that maybe if I show a little bit more kindness, she will maybe get on the right track. 

So one day I picked her up, I took her to my house, I told her to shower, use my products, gave her a bag of clothes, made her food and coffee. I did her laundry and folded it nicely in a bag with some face masks for her to use, feminine products and so on. 

I went in the bathroom to bring her a towel, only to find a bunch of my clothes balled up, and hidden inside her shirt, makeup, my glasses went missing also and I couldn’t ever find those, 
 Pants, socks, underwear, perfume… allot of things. 

I’m feeling very hurt. I’ve spent all morning crying. 

I didn’t say anything. I did take my things back though, while she was distracted. And hid them in my room. She never said anything to me, and I didn’t say anything to her. She knew she had been caught. 

I told her that she needed to go home, that I had things to do and to hurry in the shower, and she did. The car ride was her just telling me how much she loves me, and looks at me like family and how much she appreciates me. 

It made me feel sick, violated and used. I nodded up until I dropped her off. And as soon as she got out I cried all the way home. 

It feels like I’m grieving someone who is still alive. She would have never done this to me before. 

I have this aching feeling in my stomach and it won’t go away. I feel sick. 

I don’t have very many friends. Allot of them fell into hard drugs, went homeless. Got off track with their lives. 

I feel lonely and like I’m just someone to use, to take from. I feel incredibly hurt and sad over this. 

I’m not sure what to do from here. I’m just venting. I wish I had just 1 solid. Good friend. ",1,1743554122.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I’d like to know if I’m in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable about this or not.

For context, I’m an AFAB nonbinary person, and was 23 at the time (25 now). I still live with my parents as of present due to my health problems.

I’m chronically ill and I try to make money doing freelance illustration work from home. I’ve been somewhat successful at this and felt somewhat proud that I’d signed a contract to have my work published in something, and got a decent chunk of change from it. 

I tried to tell my parents about this with the expectation they’d be happy for me or supportive, and decided to tell my dad one morning I was alone in the kitchen with him as we both got our morning coffee. I told him something along the lines of “So, guess who made (money amount) this week!”. Immediately my dad responded with “What’ve you been doing, selling naked pictures or something?” Embarrassingly I didn’t even make out what he said at first and thought he said “what have you been doing making pictures?” as in my freelance stuff, and excitedly said “yeah!” before he laughed and repeated himself and clarified what he actually said, assumedly implying I could have only made that amount through doing OnlyFans or something.

Naturally I was fucking mortified once he repeated himself and I told him that I felt uncomfortable and said that was inappropriate for him to say to me. I don’t have anything against sex workers but this felt really weird coming from my dad of all people, and him immediately following up with the “oh it was just a joke, don’t be so sensitive” routine certainly didn’t make me feel any better. 

He’s never sexually assaulted me or anything, but this isn’t his first rodeo making jokes that I frankly think are really fucking uncalled for coming from my parent. Joking that a charcoal sheet face mask I was wearing looked like a gimp mask, that studded pleather boots I bought looked like BDSM gear… he’s even barged on me while I was attempting to nap and chastised me for making him feel uncomfortable for not wearing a bra while I was in my own bedroom. Not my fault he walked in on me.

I don’t know. It’s all just very tasteless stuff in my opinion. I’m asexual but not particularly prude, I wouldn’t really care so much if this were coming from a friend who I was cool with as opposed to my fucking dad. He also additionally knows I’m asexual and tend to be uncomfortable with discussing sex with people in general. Would I be reasonable in considering this kind of behavior to be sexual harassment?

My partner in crime has arrived in my new city from south of the border on an Au Pair assignment. I'd met her for a short walk a few weeks ago - nothing more than a friendly chat, but she surprised me with a direct suggestion for something further via a message shortly after the first time we met.

Today, I was pleased to find a message from her suggesting a brief meeting. I live a spartan existence in an old home - the greying wood floors of my room are ancient and the lead paint of my windows is flaking off. Music comes from my classical guitar or a beat up speaker I've toted through three continents.

While I swept and cleaned, Bach's 6 Partitas played. This was enormously pleasant during the mindless activity of cleaning and waiting for my date to arrive.

We drank coffee - and I'll save you the details, but I just want you to know that Gould played the entire time during our brief tryst.

I'll start by saying that I am making a gastroenterologist appointment right after this post. I will seek a doctor in my current situation. 

In recent years, I've been hit with pretty bad whammies as far as stomach bugs. I got norovirus and food poisoning back-to-back about a year ago, and ever since then, my esophagus has felt less strong...if that makes any sense. Acid reflux seemed to follow soon after the sickness. If I ever bent over (working out, picking up something off the ground), I kind of felt like I had to ""hold back"" whatever might come up from my esophagus. Fortunately, for a long time, nothing came of it and it was just something I was mindful of.

  
Just the other day, I had another stomach bug albeit not as violent as the one prior, but I still puked. Two days later - today - I bent over to pick up something off the ground and completely vomited myself out of nowhere. I wasn't nauseous beforehand. I didn't feel it coming this time. I had no warning. It's as if I broke a valve in my esophagus.

I am healthy and exercise regularly. I have some ""bad"" habits like daily coffee. Maybe time to reaccess.

Now, the used car market at that time was insane. Covid supply chain issues massively increased demand for used cars and inflated prices. I really wanted a Prius, and unfortunately there were not many available in my area. After weeks of looking, the best deal I could find was a relatively high-mileage 2012 Prius for $21,000. I bought it, and this is the worst decision I have ever made.

Soon after, I moved out to Seattle for my job. I found an apartment sight-unseen, and as it turns out, the area I started living in was just ABSURDLY walkable. I have a grocery store literally across the street, and within a 10-minute walk, access to a million bars, restaurants and coffee shops, specialty stores, parks, a movie theater, a library. Even medical services: my dentist is 4 blocks away, and when I had appendicitis last month, I walked myself to the ER! I am continually amazed with this place, every time I think of something I want or need, I can consistently find it within a 15-minute walk. Even better, I didn't need my car to commute. There's a bus right outside my apartment that goes directly downtown, and the bike ride to my office took 30 minutes, almost entirely on quiet waterfront bike trails. So, during my daily life, my car mostly sat unused in the garage. At first, my partner and I would take the car farther away to the cheaper grocery stores, favorite restaurants, etc., but we slowly realized that driving was making us miserable, and we were much happier walking to the local stores and restaurants. Eventually, the car started to sit unused for weeks at a time.

Now, we did take some epic road trips and used the car to drive out into the mountains for hiking, camping, and skiing. I wouldn't give up those trips for anything. Luckily, I wouldn't have had to give them up to not own a car. For one, who goes to the mountains alone? I frequently had friends to carpool with. For two, I had both rental cars and a car-sharing services available to me. Of course, rental cars are expensive. I probably spent a good 30 days on road trips, total, which, assuming about $100/day, would have been $3000. I could easily have dropped another thousand on car-sharing over the years. That sounds like a lot, but you know what's also expensive? CAR OWNERSHIP.

Over the last two years I spent around:

- $4000 on auto insurance

- $2400 a year for a parking spot

- $500 on oil changes

- $1000+ in repairs

- $500 for new tires

- $400 for registration/tabs

(Some of these amounts are absurdly high, but remember, it's Seattle.)

Those expenses alone would have generously covered my projected car rental costs. But remember how back when I bought the car, the used market was insane? Well, the market went back to normal. My car is two years older and has 24k more miles on it. It is now worth... $4,000. That's a $17,000 depreciation. When I think back on my experience owning a car, there really have been some times that it's been extremely convenient to have. I also loved the feeling of having a car to call my own. We've been on some great adventures, and I am genuinely sad to be getting rid of her. Her name is Jane, by the way. But if you asked me to put a dollar amount on the convenience and good feelings? I can tell ya it would not be anywhere near the roughly TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I wasted on car ownership.

TL;DR: I got a car even though I didn't actually need one, and it was extremely expensive.",40,1743553213.0,fuckcars,4,0.95,False

The low rumble of a motorcycle echoed through the quiet streets as Maxine pulled up outside a dimly lit café, killing the engine with a practiced flick of her wrist. The cool night air carried the faint scent of rain, and she took a slow drag from her cigarette, letting the smoke curl into the sky before flicking the ember away.

She wasn’t here for company, not really. Just a coffee, maybe a moment to breathe before heading back to the chaos that was her life. The glow of her phone screen reflected off her glasses as she scrolled mindlessly, the distant hum of the city filling the silence.

Inside, the café was nearly empty—just a few late-night wanderers tucked into corners, lost in their own worlds. She stepped in, the scent of roasted beans and fresh pastries wrapping around her like a familiar embrace. A distraction. That’s all she needed. Something to pull her mind away from the weight pressing on her chest.

Maxine slid into a booth by the window, drumming her fingers against the table as she waited for her order. Whether she was looking for trouble, conversation, or just a few minutes of peace, she wasn’t sure. But the night was young, and anything could happen.

[Feel free to approach her—whether you’re a stranger, an old friend, or something in between.]

1jpb9gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jpb9gf/am_i_the_ahole_for_not_wanting_to_choose_sides/,Am I the AHole for not wanting to choose sides when my friends broke up?,"Hellooo!! I just made a Reddit account because I'm desperate and need external advice on this.

I am from Spain. Not relevant to the story, just in case I write something wrong. xD

So here is the story. I have a group of five friends: Pedro, Ana, David, Sofía and me (made up names). We met when we were studying our profesional degree (I think that's how you say it in english jajaja) of Illustration. So like higher studies of arts.

Pedro and Ana were dating. I mean, already dating before we met them. So we were equally friends with both of them. And it's not easy to pick a friend over another, especially when I think both of them acted very wrong. Like, there is not a good one and a bad one.
The relationship had always been really toxic. They had so many high and lows. And the highs were amazing, but oh my god the lows... XD You could feel the tension at every slightly difficult time. By that I mean, even choosing pizza at a restaurant was a reason to fight over. It was not a surprise when we recieved the news that they broke up. Well, it is a surprise that they lasted 10 years...

So she is the one who delivers the news in a groupchat that she created without Pedro in it and told us not to say nothing to him until he felt like opening up about it, because he was not taking it well. Kinda shady, but she should know him better than us. All she said at first is that she tried to end it in good terms and he made it impossible so she didn't want to see him again.
She litteraly said ""When you hang with him, I'm not gonna be there with you. But I would still like to meet you separetly"" **Keep this in mind** She then asked to meet us in person and we all agreed.

I went to this meeting fully knowing that it would be difficult to see Pedro whith the same eyes after. I mean, the one who gives their version first starts with advantage. That's why I told her that I didn't want to know private details unless she really needed to talk about it. The things that I heard were still not pleasent.

She told us how he would get really angry all the time and say nasty things, comment about her wheight and he would even spoil the surprises we prepared for her birthday. One day in the heat of an argument he broke his phone (that she paid) in two halves with his own hands and that's when she decided it was over. But he didn't want to break up so he wouldn't stop trying to contact her. The messages would switch from ""I love you so much I can't live without you"" to ""I hope you get run up by a truck"" an back. I told her to block him and she gave me an excuse not to. I dont remember exactly what she said because it didn't make a lot of sense. Kinda gave me the impression that she wanted him to keep sending messages.
Us- Well, then let us talk with him so we can calm him down.
Ana- No! He will think that I am talking shit about him. I will solve it myself.
After going back and forth we said okay and comforted her. It still didn't sit well with me because maybe all he needed was a little bit off support too and things could deescalate.

Days passed and he decided to talk about it too. He said that the relationship has always been shitty and full off resenment because he would give his all and take care of her but she wouldn't do the same for him. Then he would get really mad and do bad things in revenge to her or even break up, but then they would reconcile so the same issue would keep happening over and over again. He admitted that what he did was very wrong but its difficult to be ignored and stepped on in a relationship where you are giving so much. Not an excuse but he owned up to it so at least there's that. We didn't mention the messages that she showed us and just comforted him too in hopes that things would get better for both of them.

More days passed and she filed a restraining order against him.

(Dramatic pause) XD

We were shocked because they litteraly live in the same street. How is that restraining order gonna work? Maybe I am biased but I think it would be easier to block him and let us talk to him about it, but whatever.

Here I have to introduce another character. Ana's little sister, Noelia. She was the one who convinced her to file the restraining order and to break up with him (that last one was actually a good advice), and just kinda has been the main influence on Ana's life lately. Here are the main events that happened after the restraining order event.

- We learn Pedro lost a contract on a book publisher (and not an indie one) because he had to drive Ana to conventions all around Spain where she sold her art. He sold in these too, but much less than her so the publisher was a BIG OPORTUNITY. Us artists know how difficult it is to get in a book publisher as an illustrator. But because of the constant travel he couldn't keep up with the due dates and lost the job. He then got scolded by Ana for not trying enough, but never in this time she proposed to go alone to this conventions to give him time. 

- David cuts contact with Ana because she begins to ghost him when he talked to her about his self exit thoughts. She would text three days later saying she was busy. This made him very paranoid and worsened his mental state. So he decided to distance from her. They both had a conversation about this and he said that it was true what Pedro said, that she never offers emotional support and that she was selfish. Noelia's opinion on this is that she ""Shits on David's mother and on his dead relatives"" (a really mean spanish cursing).
When I asked why, she says ""My sister doesn't need to be reminded that Pedro exists"". (???)

- After the trial Pedro said that if he saw Ana he would beat her up, and regretted saying that right after. But, man... I know you are frustrated but you can't go saying that when you have a restraining order. After this Sofía starts doubting whether if its a good idea to keep having contact with him. He says he was so in his head and didn't realise that he was losing it. He only needed someone to tell him to stop (what I told her).

- Ana starts claiming that on a trip he once got mad and threatened to leave, so she got on the way. He aparently hold her tight by the arms an got her out of the way so this left the mark do his fingers on her arm. Pedro denies this. I dont know if its true or not.

- We learn that at one point Pedro was closer to Noelia than Ana, because the little sister listened to his problems and actually gave emotional support. Because off this he developed some kind of crush or platonic interest and confessed this to Ana. He never made a move with the sister apparently but she now claims that one day that the three of them were sleeping on the same bed with him sandwitched in the middle (wierd), he waddled his fingers around her crotch area. We were 19 and Noelia was 15. So because of this he is now also a PDF? I don't know seems kind of a reach. Like why they had him sleeping in the middle after he confessed that. And also sleeping you move??? If you are facing him pressed against him is it that unbelievable to think that it wasn't in purpose?

- David and Pedro are having coffee and Ana and Noelia want to go inside the coffee shop they are at. When the sisters don't see them anymore at the terraza (don't know the name of that in english) they go inside but turns out the boys were at the bathroom. Noelia lost it because Pedro was breaking the restraining order limits. But he was litteraly there first. She then says that its not true they came from the bathroom and that the boys entered before them and started looking for a seat inside. And honestly, I can't talk for Pedro anymore but I 100% know David wouldn't allow that.

- Ana and Noelia go to the groupchat and say that what David did is disgusting and that there is no need to say that you don't hang out with an ABUSER. And that that choice has concecuences (like stop talking to the person). I was so confused because at the start she acknowleged the fact that we were gonna hang out with him too. And now this??? 

So this is the situation. David and Pedro in one side, Ana and Noelia on the other. I dont really care for the little sister but I don't want to lose Ana, and neither the boys. I feel like Noelia is getting into her head and isolating her from other people. Or maybe I am too lenient on Pedro and that is the proper reaction to his doings. I don't know, they were pretty crappy with each other. None of them are saints, if he's an abuser then she can be considered one too for neglecting him (?).
The other day I was playing wrestling with my boyfriend and he ended almost going to ER, maybe I am an abuser too. Seems a reach.

Sofía is so done with this and thinking cutting the boys.
I just want to talk to Ana and reason with her, without Noelia by her side. I appreciate both of the friendships the same and I really don't want to lose them. Sofía thinks that its gonna dinamitate the whole friendship. I don't know anymore...

I was wondering what your thoughts are on explaining something that happens with my twin and I.

Examples:
- twin wrote a note on my window that says he is sorry and if I want to go to a certain place for dinner. I call him, never seeing the note and ask him if he wants that same thing for dinner. This happened again yesterday. I had veggies for lunch in my car but around 10 am I was thinking about how it would be nice to have something warm for lunch, which I never think to myself, and I thought that I wanted to go to a certain restaurant. I pondered the idea and decided that we could have it together for dinner. I called him that afternoon and asked him if we could have it for dinner. He said, “What?” I repeated the question. He excitedly said yes. Later on that evening when we were ready to leave I said that I needed to use the bathroom and then would be ready to go. When I got out of the bathroom he was already in the car. I got in and shut the door. He said, “I’m about to blow your mind.” He lifted up the disposable coffee cup he had made me that morning. On the bottom he had written if I wanted that same restaurant for dinner. This *did* blow my mind. We were long distance until I moved in with him October 1st. In that time we have only gone to that restaurant one time. So HOW is it just a coincidence? 

- I press the button to call him and the call doesn’t go through because my phone immediately starts ringing. It is him.

- He says something and I say, “I WAS LITERALLY THINKING ABOUT ASKING YOU JUST NOW.” He says, “I know.” Sometimes the same thing happens the other way around. 

He tells me constantly that he can read my mind. Then I thought I could read his too. This happens a few times each day. I don’t think it is mind reading at this point. I’m not trying to. He isn’t trying to. It still seems unbelievable to me each and every time. It reminds me of an experience with a haunting in that I confidently know what I experienced but I also can’t believe it. 

**What would you call this? Telepathy? Would you say it is coincidental? Is there another name for this that I could look into?**

When I’ve tried to read about it I’m just unsure about what exactly it is. If you could point me in the direction of proper terminology I would love to learn more. ",2,1743553062.0,TwinFlame,3,1.0,False

If you have been given this book, then it means you have either been assigned or volunteered to administer the MultiVer Medical Solutions takeover of a former Predator Disease Facility, with the goal of turning it into a modern and functioning hospital. In case no one has said it yet, congratulations on your new job! 

You may have heard the horror stories about the mistreatment, neglect, or even outright torture that have gone on at facilities such as the one you will be running. You may be wondering if you are capable of reforming such a facility, or even if such a facility can be reformed, and if you haven't, you will certainly wonder these things at some point, likely when you first arrive to meet the faculty and patients.

But fear not. With perseverance, intelligence, integrity, and the guidance of this book, you too can join the many brilliant minds with MultiVer Medical Solutions who have turned places of ruin and despair into beacons of healing and community, just as I did when I reformed the Ipsomath Predator Disease Facility in 2138, and showed the whole galaxy How to Fix a Predator Disease Facility.

### **MultiVer Housing Complex, Tonalu, Skalga**

### **January 9th, 2138**

The alarm clock was about to go off, and Chuck had already been up for an hour.

Skalga’s eternal daylight seeped in through the  cracks in the auto-blinds of his apartment window, a constant reminder that the planet never truly slept. It wasn’t that Chuck was a morning person, necessarily. It was more that his mind refused to sit still when something important loomed. And today was, indeed, important.

He stood in the narrow kitchenette of his small but well-kept apartment in the MultiVer Housing Complex, nursing a cup of black tea loaded with artificial sweetener. He never liked coffee- too bitter for his tastes- so tea was his morning beverage of choice. His breakfast was more utilitarian: a protein bar and a bowl of plain oat cereal, remnants of his time as a med student with no time for culinary finesse. He ate mechanically, reviewing bullet points in his head for the fifth time.

Qualifications. Leadership experience. Familiarity with interspecies care models. Flexibility in field conditions. Personal vision for the future of accessible medicine. He could recite it all forwards and backwards.

His clothes were laid out the night before: a crisp, white-collared shirt and a slate-gray jacket with narrow lapels. He smoothed the fabric over his arms as he dressed, taking a moment to check the collar in the mirror. A hint of nervous energy danced in his fingers, but he steadied them with a breath. Charles Shultz Broughton, MD, was ready.

Outside, the ever-present daylight gave the illusion of mid-afternoon, though it was just past seven AM local time. The MultiVer Housing Complex sat in the heart of Tonalu, built with practical angles and UV-shielded glass. Hover-cabs hummed through the traffic grid, and the streets teemed with a mix of human and alien life. The air was clean and clear, and the breeze carried the metallic tang of industrial vents and market aromas.

Chuck made his way to the corporate side of the complex, nodding politely to a janitor scrubbing the stairs and to a pair of nurses chatting by the entrance. One of them offered him a smile.

“Big day, Dr. Broughton?”

“The biggest,” he said with a polite grin, though he didn’t slow his stride. His mind was already two steps ahead.

The elevator ride to the President’s office was silent save for the hum of the motors and the soft tone of the floor indicators. When he arrived, the secretary outside Mr. Veir’s office gestured him in without looking up.

Dr. Broughton stepped into the office with his tablet in hand, ready to make his case. He stood tall, confidence in every inch of his posture.

Stanley Veir, President of the Skalga Division, didn’t look up from his desk. Veir was a man of few words, his demeanor often mistaken for hostility. Broughton knew better—or at least, he hoped he did. 

“Dr. Broughton. Take a seat.”

Chuck hesitated, then complied, tablet balanced on his knee.

“Mr. Veir, thank you for making time this early in the morning. I wanted to speak with you about the newly acquired hospital—”

“No need to make your case. The matter has already been settled,” Veir interrupted, voice clipped, eyes still fixed on the screen in front of him.

Chuck faltered. He shut his tablet with a soft snap. “Understood, sir. Thank you for your consideration.”

He rose smoothly, professionalism masking the sting in his chest. He turned to leave.

“Doctor.”

He stopped.

Veir finally looked up. His brow creased in what might have been regret. “I meant that I’ve already decided to tap you for the position. Congratulations.”

Chuck blinked. “I- sir?”

Veir sighed, running a hand down his face. “You’re the administrator for the Ipsomath hospital. You start next week. We have transit arranged for you, and we have housing set up in town. Sorry for the confusion. I’m not great with the… delivery.”

A smile tugged at the corner of Chuck’s mouth, but he kept it in check. “Thank you, Mr. Veir. I appreciate the opportunity. I won’t let you down.”

“I know you won’t,” Veir said gruffly. “We need someone qualified and driven, and you were, quite simply, the optimal candidate.” He paused, then added, almost reluctantly, “Apologies for the miscommunication.”

Broughton allowed himself a small, professional smile. “No harm done, sir.”

Mr. Veir took off his reading glasses and looked Chuck dead in the eye. “One last thing: medicine on Skalga is mostly public, so the local government is taking a large risk by selling this hospital to us. We need to show them that MultiVer can do it cheaper without cutting corners.”

Chuck nodded, heart still catching up with the news. As he stepped back into the eternal light of Skalga’s day, he knew this was just the beginning. Today would have to be spent packing, making phone calls to the right people, and getting ready to hit the ground running.

Oh, and he was _definitely_ going to have to get more used to wearing that dumb mask.

### **Ipsomath Magistrate’s Office, Ipsomath, Skalga**

### **January 12th, 2138**

Ipsomath, loosely translated as “Wheat Crossing” in English, was far from the hustle and bustle of Tonalu. The mostly agricultural town, named for the crossing point where farmers harvesting Ipsom grain would bring their crops to market, was isolated from bigger cities like Tonalu and Dayside, which might make one wonder why a hospital was built here. 

Of course, with space travel, the bar for being isolated was a bit higher, so perhaps that figured into the planning of the facility. 

Chuck stepped out of the modest transport shuttle and took in the town with a sweep of his eyes. Low, sun-faded buildings stretched along narrow roads. The air smelled faintly of dry grass and irrigation chemicals. The constant daylight of Skalga hung heavy, but the atmosphere here felt almost sleepy.

The Magistrate’s Office was a squat concrete structure at the town’s center, its outer walls coated in a pale orange plaster that was flaking in places. A faded wooden sign– “Ipsomath Magistrate Office,” written in Venscript-- hung over the door. Despite the Babelfish translator in his ear, Chuck had taken the time to familiarize himself with the written Venlil language, and knew some of the more important words.

Inside, the lobby was sparsely furnished, with a few potted plants and cushioned benches that looked like they hadn’t been sat on in years. A young Venlil male behind the reception desk froze when Chuck entered. His wide, tan-furred ears stiffened, and his tail flicked with nervous energy.

“Hi there,” Chuck said, offering a gentle smile, before realizing it wouldn’t be seen under his mask, and the Venlil before him might not understand the meaning if it was. “Dr. Charles Broughton. I have an appointment with Magister Shalon.”

The Venlil stared at him for a moment too long before stammering, “Y-you’re human.”

Dr. Broughton chuckled softly. “Guilty as charged. Don’t worry, I won’t be taking this mask off. Can you let the Magister know I’m here?”

The young Venlil flicked his ear and scrambled to his feet, disappearing into the door behind him. After a brief pause and some muffled conversation, Magister Shalon appeared in the doorway. She was older, with a silvery streak in her fur and the measured posture of someone who hadn’t expected visitors.

“Dr. Broughton,” she said, voice cautious but polite.

Chuck extended a hand, then quickly withdrew it with an apologetic smile. “Please, Dr. Broughton is my father. And my mother, come to think of it. You can call me Chuck.”

The Magister’s ear twitched. “ A Human cultural norm. In that case, call me Shalon.” She extended a paw, which Chuck shook.  “I wasn’t expecting a representative from MultiVer. They didn’t say anyone would be visiting.”

Beneath the mask, Chuck’s eyebrows raised in surprise. “Actually, I left a voicemail three days ago… I planned to tour the facility today.” He shot a brief glance toward the empty desk. “I guess your secretary forgot to pass that along.”

Shalon sighed, clearly connecting the dots. “He’s my nephew. He’s… still a little uneasy around humans. I can assure you, you’ll find no problem with me.”

“Good to know,” Chuck said with a nod. “But I _am_ here, and I’m not going anywhere. As you know, MultiVer acquired the Center for Physical and Mental Wellness last week. And as per the contract, we reserved the right to change its structure, staffing, and oversight as we see fit.”

Her ears twitched. “I thought that clause was hypothetical.”

“Really? That’s surprising. It tends to be standard operating procedure with facility acquisitions. But in any case, I’ll be overseeing the transition myself.”

The Magister stepped aside to let him in fully. Her office was as modest as the building itself: a wide desk, two chairs, and a cluttered shelf of agricultural reports. She gestured for him to sit.

“I have to admit something, Chuck. I’ve never actually been to the facility. It was built before my time, and to be honest, it ran itself. The government gave us a yearly grant to keep it operating, and I let the staff manage things internally.”

“That’s… also surprising,” Chuck said, polite but firm. “But I’m afraid that approach will end today. MultiVer will be conducting a full evaluation, and I intend to be very hands-on.”

Shalon nodded slowly. “Well, I suppose I should finally go see what it is we’re turning over to you.”

Chuck smiled. “I’d appreciate the company.”

The transport ride to the Ipsomath Center for Physical and Mental Wellness was quiet. Shalon kept glancing out the window, and Chuck used the time to review some facility maps on his tablet.

The building itself was large, surrounded by a high perimeter fence and tall hedges that blocked most of it from public view. The gates were old but well-maintained, and the signage was simple: Ipsomath Center for Physical and Mental Wellness. No logo. No branding. Just institutional gray.

Chuck stepped through the main doors with the Magister at his side. The interior was clean, though clearly outdated. A reception desk sat at the far end of the atrium, behind a glass barrier with a small service slot.

Before Chuck could speak, the receptionist—a narrow-faced Venlil with stiff posture—looked up and scowled.

“You’re not allowed in here,” she said sharply.

Chuck blinked. “Excuse me?”

“Visitors are by appointment only, and humans are not allowed on these premises,” she said curtly. “Please leave.”

Chuck stepped forward calmly. “Actually, I’m Dr. Charles Broughton. I’m the new administrator of this Center.”

The receptionist’s expression didn’t change. “That can’t be. This is a Predator Disease facility. A human has no business here.”

Chuck turned slowly toward the Magister, a pit forming in his stomach. “Magister… this is a Predator Disease facility?”

She looked uncomfortable, looking around, as if she was trying to find a way out of this situation. “Yes.”

Chuck’s gaze behind his mirrored mask hardened, even though he knew Shalon couldn’t see his eyes. “I thought Governor Tarva’s order shut all of them down last year. Why wasn’t this one closed?”

The receptionist scoffed and gave what passed as a pointed look among Venlil to Shalon. “We changed our name. Magister Shalon here approved it herself, in fact, she demanded it. We’re not officially a Predator Disease facility anymore, so we didn’t need to close.""

Chuck took a step back, staring at Shalon, who suddenly looked very uncomfortable. “You… changed the name to dodge a planetary executive order?”

The Magister's tail twitched nervously. “ No one ever came to check.”

Chuck exhaled slowly, jaw tight. “Excuse me. I need to make a call.”

He stepped outside, tapping his earpiece. It connected after only a ring.

“Veir,” came the gruff voice on the other end.

“Sir, we have a situation,” Chuck said. “The facility in Ipsomath isn’t just neglected and underfunded. It’s a repurposed Predator Disease facility. Illegally operating under a different name.”

There was a pause. “I see.”

Chuck looked back at the building. “I can’t reform a facility like this.”

A long pause. Veir let out a sigh. “If you’re not comfortable with this, Charles, we can find another administrator. This wasn’t in the documentation, so you’re well within your rights to drop out. I can have someone else out there by tomorrow.”

“That’s not what I meant,” Chuck replied. “I can’t reform a PD facility...” He paused, then straightened his shoulders. “Not alone.”

Another pause. Then Veir’s voice shifted ever so slightly. “Go on.”

“This isn’t just a project, sir. This is an opportunity. There are defunct PD facilities all over the galaxy, perhaps even some still active, like Ipsomath’s. If we can turn one into a legitimate, functioning hospital—we won’t just be healing patients. The galaxy will be lined up outside our offices, waving their pens and falling all over themselves to get MultiVer to take over their defunct PD facilities. We’ll be swimming in government contracts. This is an opportunity alright, and it’s the biggest one MultiVer has seen since the New Deal.”

Yet another pause, the longest yet. On the other side of Skalga, in his office, Stanley Veir did the impossible.

He smiled.

If only it had been a video call, then Chuck would have seen it. But outside the Center, Chuck could only hear his voice, as gruff as ever.

“I’ll authorize a full task force. You’ll have what you need.”

Chuck nodded with a smile. “Thank you, sir.”

He ended the call, squared his shoulders, and turned back toward the facility.

I got my one parcel for free and another one for confirming my phone number, otherwise I've just been watching ads every ~20 mins for more AB. However, my goal with the app is to get around 100-200 parcels for free and then just forget it. Let it build money over time, only check in about once a month to see where it's at, and cash out when it hits $5.

My question is: Is this possible? Is there a minimum requirement of how often you have to check/use the app or your balance expires? Would my account be deactivated if I don't use it/buy land every so often?

I don't want recommendations on how to maximize my time on the app, or how to get ""passports"" and ""boosters."" I also don't want any recommendations to spend money, even my Google play balance (I use that for other apps). I just want to spend a month grinding ads to get free parcels, then leave the app to do it's thing.

I don't care if I only get $5 every 8 months, money is money. If it lets me treat myself to an extra coffee twice a year that's all I need. I just want to make sure that if I stop checking the app daily and only check it once a month I won't lose my balance and progress.

I bought a second hand Jura Z10 last week for a neighbour. It’s 4 years old and brewed 1300 coffees so far. It was a good deal.

Since 5 days, I have been trying to have a good espresso without success. I’m coming from a Breville Barista Express on which I was able to make great espresso with nice gold crema. I wanted to go full automatic to save time in the morning.

After multiple reads here, dozens of tests and watching videos on YouTube I realize that my Z10 weak espresso with a gray creama is coming from the fact that the grinder does not output a lot of coffee..

For example with :

1) beans selection to 10 beans
2) espresso shot for 30 sec

The output of coffee is only 7 grams before the espresso is made. I did not realize at first but the coffee pucks are very thin once the espresso is done.

With the beans selection to 10 I was expecting  around 16g of grinded coffee.

As the ultimate test to confirm my issue, I grinded 16 grams of coffee beans  in my breville and made an espresso by putting the grinded coffee in the chute of the Z10. The coffee was amazing with thick gold crema.

What is wrong with my Z10? How can I get the machine to grind more coffee? 

I’ve executed all the maintenance that were required on the screen.

Took my LO out in the stroller today for his mid-day nap, which is typically 1.5 hours. I figured I'd venture further out and loop back, and get a coffee at the halfway mark. When I stopped to order, the barista was VERY loud and woke my baby up. I tried to rock him gently back to sleep in the stroller and he drifted back off. Then the barista called my order up loudly AGAIN, and this time my baby did not want to fall back asleep and was starting to get fussy We were still 50 minutes away from home.

At first I tried to walk back and sort of ignore him, bring down the sun shade and just encourage him to go back to sleep. It wasn't working and now my baby started to full on cry and scream. I walked faster. Baby is now covered in red splotches and is freaking out. I walk faster. He's crying harder and it dawns on me how far away I am, no option for transit, no carseat so I can't jump in an uber or anything. My body goes into fight or flight.

At this point I started to push the stroller very fast, I was basically running to try to get home faster. Which in hindsight was a TERRIBLE idea because our sidewalks aren't even. And alas, I ACCIDENTALLY HIT A CRACK in the sidewalk and I saw his head bounce up very sharply and he started crying even stronger. Of course I freak out, stop the stroller and pull him out, only to accidentally hit the top of his head on the stroller roof. And now I'm realizing how much damage I've done because I couldn't stay calm. I think about calling my husband to pick us up but he's slammed at work and my ego says no.

At this point, he's melting down and I'm melting down. I hold him, try to regulate both of us. He calms down, so I put him back in the stroller and he starts screaming again. At this point I gave in and called my husband at work to drop everything and pick us up.

I'm so mad at myself at how I handled the situation. I should have NEVER started running with the stroller, I did it out of rash and panic and ended up in a situation where I could have really hurt my baby. Looking back I should have just found a bench to nurse him while waiting for my husband to pick us up. I had so much ego to not disturb him at work that I wanted to prove that I could handle the situation myself. And I couldn't.

I feel like the world's worst mother that can't handle her emotions when her baby cries. I feel like I can never take him out in the stroller again.",16,1743552172.0,beyondthebump,8,0.86,False

We are in relationship for more than 9months and she love me very much and I love her very much . We are open to each other on everything and we communicate as much we can . We both are honest and straightforward and have pretty healthy relationship. 

So I’m out of country rn for trip with family . There is 2hr + time difference and I’ve poor network here so messages are delayed and we aren’t able to vid call / audio call due to privacy and network issues . 

For some more context she used to talk to many random guys online on all kind of stuff as she was single back then but after coming into relationship she herself stopped that without ever pointing out which is truly remarkable change I appreciate her I’m glad she did it herself but today she was texting a random senior she don’t even know . So I came online while she was talking to that guy in insta but she still continued chatting with him . Yeah I’ll agree my internet was slow so messages were delayed ( 10-40 sec ) , video / audio weren’t clear on call but I’m shocked that she was chatting with him simultaneously almost whole time literally even when we were arguing when I taunted her on this thing . 

She said she had opened the my chat waiting for messages but replying him from notifications. Yeah I got angry as today I rushed from the place to come to hotel and have a chat with her but she did this but later on things ended on good note but now I’m feeling disappointed. 

If she says I’m her first priority then why she was continuously talking to that guy , can’t she wait for my message as I’ve genuine issue.  

Also for the chatting it wasn’t much special he was trying to talk to her by roasting himself, she was just roasting her while staying respectful to him . She asked some study related questions ( little bit ). Also that guy was calling her names) idiot in native language which isn’t offensive, which further annoyed me ) . Also that guy asked for coffee but she turned it down and he complimented her also flirted ( I really hate it when someone flirts with her but she can’t control what other person will say) but she just stayed playful so that she won’t disrespect him. I have context above because I want to know that she had habit of that freedom of doing anything to anyone so what could be a possible reason she was chatting with him when I was talking to her ?

Maybe I’m insecure or very jealous person ( maybe both ) but I’m okay when she talks to her male friends / person she knows but this random person thing I’m not okay with it . Every time she had long chats with random person I’m overthinking , we have fight because of person we both even don’t know but she still do this like after 2-3 months .

I believe this my disrespect ( maybe over reacting ) .I feel like shit ngl . Like I don’t think basic things should be asked like please talk to me ( even though I’ve said earlier ( different story )) and not to someone else . We are grown up adults and we know what to do . How our action will affect other person . Yeah I check her Instagram too much read her almost every chat ( random person ones ). 

Did I overreacted? Am I controlling freak who can’t watch her talking to other guy ? Maybe I’m boring ? 

Yeah also I’m an overthinker so I can’t sleep rn even though I was very very tired .

I was thinking about getting an Allez Sprint but I found a roughly used 2024 Allez for a real steal. So much that I could upgrade it with an used Ultegra groupset, new brake rotors, carbon seatpost and used carbon wheels for way less than the price my LBS asked me for a new Allez Sprint with 105. I don't mind that much the endurance geometry of the entry level Allez, actually it's making me think that I could even do some light bikepacking with it.  
My concerns are about the frameset stiffness and its weight compared to the Allez Sprint. I'm not looking to spend money on a frame which weights a ton and is soft as butter. So, does anyone have/had/has had both and can tell me if there are some tangible differences in terms of weight and reactivity between the two frames? Forks too of course

Thank you :)

I love warm nights, playful banter, and the kind of connection that makes you feel like you’ve known someone in another lifetime.

I’m a cat lover, a Minecraft cottagecore enthusiast (yes, I have a virtual greenhouse and a barn, don’t judge), and someone who finds magic in little things—like the first breeze of spring, the smell of fresh coffee, or sharing snacks during a movie night. I’m the kind of person who’ll cheer you on even when you’re unsure of yourself—and yes, I’ll probably save your name in my phone with a cute emoji.

Mental health is important to me, and I’m drawn to people who are kind, emotionally present, and a little weird in the best way. If you’re the type to text random song lyrics or go on spontaneous late-night walks, we’ll get along.

Bonus points if you:
– speak more than one language
– know your way around a kitchen (or at least can hype me up while I cook)
– are sweet with a mischievous streak
– love trying new foods even if it’s “just for the story”

Let’s talk. Tell me what you’re passionate about or send me a voice note if you have an accent that could ruin my life (in a good way).

(Sorry for the messy English, it's not my 1st language)

About 8-9 months ago, I (19M) walked in on my then GF in bed with another guy. Needless to say, this one event (and the ensuing messy breakup) did a number on my mental health and it took me a very long time to get back to where I was. I went on a healing journey, picked up some hobbies, stayed consistent at the gym, and I tried to expand my horizons a little bit. All to make me a better person and with the goal of becoming more desirable. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my progress, but I was perfectly happy with the person I was before the breakup (Gym 5x a week, fluent in 3 languages, decent personality, etc.), so my main motivator behind further self improvement was finding a life partner.

Now recently, I felt ready enough to start dating again. The apps were a complete disaster. Less than 10 matches total over 2 months (I tended to swipe right on 50% of profiles), with most either never responding or being bots/scammers. I did also go out and meet people, both through my hobbies (Rugby, book club, volunteering mainly), and at bars and clubs (usually went out with my friends on Fridays). I've always struggled to talk to women (really bad social anxiety and ADHD), so I never got anywhere at clubs and bars. I was able to give good impressions but I could never keep someone's attention before they got bored or moved on to the next guy. I had a bit more luck at the food bank I volunteer at and met this wonderful girl there.

We hit it off really quickly. Turns out we share a lot of the same interests (she was also a big reader and had been interested in rugby), and she even had the same tastes as I did with both TV and books. It all really seemed too good to be true, but when we get comfortable with each other I asked her out for coffee. Things went really well, and we committed to a 2nd date. The 2nd date also went well and we started dating regularly. We really clicked and started dating regularly. I made sure to be myself, which she seemed to enjoy, and I didn't bring up anything too sexual unless the conversation prompted it. I felt like I may have finally found that happiness I was chasing with my ex, so I made plans to ask her to be exclusive on our 6th date. We made plans, and I paid for a reservation at a pretty nice restaurant. I also set up a small surprise at an overlook nearby where I'd pop the question.

I never got that far.

On the day, I texted her in the morning to make sure we were still on, and we updated each other throughout the day. Originally the plan was for me to pick her up and drive us, but she told me something came up and she'd meet me there. I guess this was the first red flag. I got to the restaurant, and I waited. I tried texting and calling, but 0 response. I waited until the restaurant called and told me they couldn't hold our reservation anymore, so I cancelled it, went home, and just cried for a very long time. I've been rejected, ghosted, and even stood up since I had started dating again but it never felt like actual betrayal before.

This was all 3 days ago and I don't think I've ever felt this lonely. At this point I've lost my motivation and only get out of bed to attend classes and get my homework done. I feel like some kind of freak, undeserving of love. I push everyone away, I did it with my ex, and now I've done it with this girl and I don't even know what I did wrong. She seemed fine earlier in the day but just dissappears later. We've met and hung out so many times. I just feel disgusted by myself. I thought I could handle failure but at this point it feels like a pattern with me as the common denominator. I feel pathetic getting this hung up over someone I wasn't even in a relationship with, and all the repressed memories from my past breakup have come rushing back.

I've started to resent dating, but there's nothing I'd hate more than to become that one guy who sits in front of his computer all day and blames women for all his misfortunes. I want to be better. I work on myself constantly in order to be someone I can take pride in, I work out 5 times a week and I'm proud of my current state. But whats the point of living this life if I've got no one to share it with? All my close friends rave about how awesome their partners are, and how great they feel as a couple, while all I could do was grin and bear it with the hopes that I would also find someone I could share that joy with, but not anymore. I'm so close to giving up and I just can't see the point of going thru all this effort when it results in nothing.

Sorry for the vent, but I'm just so frustrated, it seems that no matter what you do, something happens.

\[SFX: WALKING FOLLOWED BY CLOTHES RUSTLE\]

Hi, babyyyy. I was going through the closet and just found this sweatshirt. Do you remember it? It's still so comfortable. It feels so very soft and very much smells amazing. I can't believe I forgot about it... I used to wear it all the time.

...

Babyyy, did you hear me? Don't you remember this?

...

\[WHISPER\] Hmm, what are you so focused on?

\[SFX: SOFT FOOTSTEPS\]

\[UP CLOSE WHISPER\] Boo!

(Laugh) What are you doing?

...

I did call you! I even tried to start a little conversation with you about this sweatshirt, but your mind was attached to something else. What's got you so drawn in?

...

I'm just curious. You know me, I'm nosy. I want to know what you- or really anyone is doing at all times. It's in my nature, I can't help it.

...

You don't make it easier. Every time I ask you things like this, you immediately tell me. Your hand is in it as much as mine is, and there are no take backs. Only take forwards.

...

That is a real thing. If it wasn't, I wouldn't have said it.

...

(Laugh) No, no, no. It's an actual phrase or something. I've seen and heard it before, for sure.

...

It happened like a few seconds ago.

...

Exactly, Me. I just said it. (laugh) That's enough proof to know it's a true saying and that it makes the most sense. Would I... ever say something that doesn't make sense? Come on. Me? Never. I only say the most profound sentences and only speak facts. Straight facts. Or like whatever you're into facts! I don't judge.

...

\[HOLDING BACK LAUGHTER\] No, I wouldn't. You are such a hater. I feel like I'm in Mean Girls or some movie with a group of girls telling me I can't do things. Take forwards will happen. You hear me. It will be in the brightest and prettiest lights all around Hollywood. Everyone will be saying it, they'll put it on everything, including cakes. (Gasp) And whole birthday party themes.

...

I don't know. Normally, that's what happens... I think. I'm not famous, so I wouldn't know.

...

Anyway, what are you working on?

...

\[SOFT\] Ohhhh.

...

Yeah, I have no idea what that means in the slightest, but go you. I know whatever it is you are doing, you are amazing and absolutely aceing it.

...

Hmm?

...

Oh no, I don't need anything. Why?

...

(Gasp) No, I do notttt. Baby... I was just-

...

Yeah, I was just a little curious about the stuff you do. Is that so wrong? I don't think so...

...

(Soft Whine) Ughhhh. Stoppp.

\[SFX: FABRIC RUSTLE\]

...

Don't look at me like that. (Laugh) I want to sit next to you.

...

(Gasp) I am not scheming. I am extremely curious about what you're working on. You are all serious-looking, typing on your laptop surrounded by papers. You'd look like you're in an office building right now if you weren't at the coffee table, on the couch with that artwork behind you. \[WHISPERING TO SELF\] We should really take that down and put it somewhere else.

...

Well, yeah, I see that, but specifically. What does all this mean?

...

(Laugh) You are completely right, but I'd like to hear about it anyway. Pleaseeee.

...

Oh okay... I still don't know what that means, but I'm sure you do. If you didn't, you wouldn't be having this job. When do you think you'll be done?

...

Five hours!? Baby noooo.

...

That's way too long. I need your attention right now, and I'm sure you could use a great long break... \[WHISPER\] forever.

...

No, I didn't say anything.

...

(Laugh) Babyyy, I need you... forever. We say forever all the time, and I dang sure mean it.

…

Okay, so what if I help you finish it? With both of us working, it'll go by so fast,  and soon we'll be cuddling or something. I’m just throwing things out. We could do anything.

...

(Whine) I know I just said that. Babyyyy...

...

Mmm, how about a kiss? Then I'll leave you alone and let you work. That sounds like a fantastic great deal to me! You definitely don’t want to miss this amazing 10/10 chance. It won’t show up again. It’s a deal that has a five-minute limit.

...

What? No.... I am not planning anything else. Just a little quick kiss, and I will be out of your hair. I promise.

...

(Holding back laughter) No, I like having my hands behind my back. It's so comfortable.

...

I am not crossing my fingers, babyyy. It's a completely honest promise. No tricks. No hidden meanings. No other thoughts, just my love for you. And my oh my, there is so much of it. I'm seeping out love only for you, of course.

...

Sorry, no can do. It's too comfortable to move. You'll just have to believe me and my promise.

...

Yup, I'm definitely sure. Are you telling me you don’t want a sweet kiss from your baby, who you love very dearly?

...

Exactly. Just a simple one.

...

(Kiss) I love you.

...

Now, I am not the least bit sorry about this. Just know I do this with so much love.

\[SFX: STRUGGLE/FABRIC RUSTLING\]

No can do, baby.

…

You’ve been working all dayyyy. It’s time for a quick break.

…

Well, quick… long, it doesn’t matter. As long as it’s a break, it’s completely good... great even.

...

I also know if it were really so important, you would be actually trying to get me off of you. So I'm taking your soft touches as you are pretty fine with taking a break with me.

...

When do you need it finished by?

...

Baby.

...

Babyyyy.

...

Baby, that's six weeks from now! Why are you doing it now? Did Bryan say it was important?

...

Then what I'm hearing is that it can absolutely wait.

...

We could've been cuddling the whole day. (playful tsks) You didn't have to rush eating breakfast in the morning at all.

...

Well, you better be prepared not to be left alone for the rest of the day. I'm sticking to you like honey.

...

Eh, close enough. (soft laugh into kiss) I love you a lot, baby.

...

Oh, I'm so serious about not leaving your side. I could add on forever, but that's a little impossible. (Whine) Why do you have to work?

...

I knowwww I work too, but baby, I love you. My job doesn't matter at all. I will go quit right now. I bet I have some resignation papers lying around somewhere, completed with my special signature.

...

Do you think I'm joking?

...

Right, come on.

\[SFX: STRUGGLE\]

(Laugh) You wanted to try and call my bluff, but I have none. I'm bluffless. So little bluff happening around here that it's not even a word in my vocabulary.

...

I know; I just said it, baby. (hmph followed by many kisses) I love you a lot. So much that my heart hurts sometimes. You mean that absolute most to me and I want you to know that.

...

Well, stop being amazing, and I'll stop saying it.

...

You're right, I wouldn't. But I would've thought about it for a little second. Only one second, though.

...

Okayyyy. Here, can I save and close your laptop?

...

\[SFX: TYPING AND SHUT\]

There you go. No having to worry about that until WAY later down the line.

...

It's getting a little close to dinner. I'm going to be honest. I don't feel like cooking right now, and I'm sure you feel the same way. Mmm, but if you didn't, I wouldn't let you anyway. Unless you want to cook with my hanging onto you.

...

You say that now, but I know as soon as we get into the kitchen, you'll be telling me to stop and how you don't want me to get hurt. ""Wait until I'm done."" (laugh) It's okay. We can order out even if it's something we can easily make ourselves.

...

Sounds like a plan!! Now get comfortable; you will not move for like two hours.

...

Yeah, you can put your head on my chest.

\[SFX: CLOTHES SHUFFLING\]

Are you good?

...

\[SOFT\] Perfect. You can close your eyes, I don't mind at all.

...

Hmmm, one last thing, though... (Kiss) I love you, baby, so so much.",3,1743551599.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False

The new norm is that people treat small cafes like their personal WeWork. They buy one $4 coffee and occupy a 4-person table for an entire business day.

Next I know people will shout: ""BUT WHAT IF THEY'RE WORKING ON IMPORTANT STUFF?""

Guys, most of these people aren't doing anything that requires a public space. It's obvious it's not crucial work when they're watching Netflix half the time or having loud Zoom calls annoying everyone around them.

The business can't say anything because they don't want negative reviews or to lose even minimal business. Currently there's no time limit enforced so paying customers can't find anywhere to sit (lol).

It feels like cafe owners have just accepted this as inevitable. I've mentioned it to a manager once and they just shrugged and looked defeated.

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job and I travel a lot. I suppose it’s a good life, I don’t brag but I’ve been told that. It drives me insane because I’m always busy. I guess busy is good.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

I have connections with coffee grounds and spend mushroom bags. I also found free mulch left on the side of the road by the city. I’ve used most of the mulch in my garden and still have about 12 cubic feet left. I added only a small amount before deciding to save the mulch for my two new raised garden beds that I bought. I feel incredibly fortunate to have these connections.

At home, I use the obvious items: kitchen scraps, tea bags, home-brewed coffee grounds, wood ash, shredded paper, plant debris, paper towels, tissues, the center rolls, and cardboard. 

Based on what I’ve read here, I suppose all I need to do now is pee on it.  (◕__◕✿)

Both sides of the compost tumbler are about 75% full. I filled it almost immediately after assembly because I had all these connections. I’m afraid I won’t be able to contribute to this tumbler anymore if the composting process doesn’t speed up. I didn’t want to use the pile method for several reasons. It seems like I may have to purchase a second compost tumbler.

I'm not a coffee-drinker / caffeine-consumer. But I'm craving a frozen, coffee-adjacent drink. Unfortunately, even decaf has a small amount of caffeine (which I can't have). I'd love something similar to these frozen beverages: Tim Horton's (iced coffee), Balzac's (iced coffee), DQ (Moo Lates), etc...

Desired flavour profile:

* Deep caramel flavour without being candy-sweet...looking for a grounded, earthy after-taste
* Smooth blend; should be icy but without chunks of ice that create an uneven / rocky texture
* Something as coffee-adjacent as possible in terms of taste (think DQ's MooLate's or Tim Horton's iced coffees...the iconic bitter / nutty taste of coffee should be present)

Have been job searching for ten months. But I can’t find anything I’m actually capable of doing. I trained in something I can’t ever do for work now due to a disability I have.

I thought about being a postman but it requires a driving licence, I can’t drive due to epilepsy. This has cut me off from most things I’m interested in. Warehouses sounded appealing but they’re all too far to travel and require previous experience or heavy lifting. I’m weak as hell and due to my disability I can’t work out. 

I can’t do anything with screens, I’m awful at maths.

I can’t handle hot things like coffee and due to said weakness I’d be an awful waitor.

There seem to be 0 supermarket jobs in a 20 mile radius. I wouldn’t mind that but they don’t seem to exist. I got rejected from McDonald’s and can’t find any other fast food places hiring. 

I’ve applied to multiple temping agencies but none have got back and they all seem to need people with specialist skills such as health workers, dentists etc. 

I’m interested in being a paintor decerator, but I think it would probably be too physical and also require a drivers license. 

I’m so stuck and I want nothing more than to work. Sorry if this sounds like a vent. I can’t claim benefits and feel completely hopeless that I’ll ever have a future.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1jpah2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/brittanydawnsnark/comments/1jpah2g/podcast_34th_birthday_as_a_new_mom/,Podcast: 34th Birthday as a New Mom,"* The editing is weirder than usual. After the preview clip of Jordan talking there is a long pause then a weird squeaky noise, then another pause before Brit starts talking. She must have been rushed to get this out. 
* Yes the sub correctly guessed M's name months ago (shoutout Suitable-King3520)
* Mother in law is watching M while they record. She can't make much money from this podcast so what a waste of babysitting time. Go take a nap or shower! Geez! They say M is milk drunk and taking a nap with Grandma.
* Brit says she could cry because they are parents and postpartum and hormonal and Jordan makes a joke about how ""That would not be new as of late!"" I love when people make fun of me when I'm emotional and freshly postpartum 😬 Jordan suggests Brittany go over the things that she has cried about recently. 
   * Brit cried in the bathroom while holding M because he was growing so fast and almost 2 weeks old and ""He's going to be in college soon."" Not if they homeschool!
   * They struggle to think of a second time.
   * Brit cried 10 mins ago because she's worried her milk is going to dry up. Jordan says it's not. 
   * They can't name anymore times she cried.
* Jordan says they are doing OK on sleep. They praise God for Jordan's mom. Sounds like she is working overtime. 
* Brit is 34 and a mom. Yes we know. They are not going to share the birth story here that is for a different podcast. Jordan says the birth was traumatizing, and Brit says the birth was beautiful. 
* Jordan says last week was special because they got to celebrate Brit as a new mom AND her birthday
* Brit says, ""I really just wanted to encourage people to pray specific details over whatever it is you're believing for in life, because for the last three years, what has my prayer been, babe? I want to be a mom by the time I'm 34."" They LiTeRaLlY had him seven days before her birthday. Jordan asks ""Seven?"" LOL
* Brit says ""which when I looked into, when I like prayed into that, seven in the Bible is the number of completion."" Oh ffs. Here she goes with this bullshit again. God didn't do this. IUI and medical science did. It's all giving prosperity gospel too. Like she God's favourite little grifter and she prayed so much harder than all those other women who want nothing more than to be a mom so she obviously gets whatever she wants. God is so busy sending Brit all these signs like her baby being born 7 days before her birthday so He doesn't have time to respond to the people in Gaza pleading for their actual lives rn. Oh fuck off. 
* They thought M was going to arrive on Brit's dad's birthday, but didn't??? I don't know when his birthday is. 
* Jordan can't get Brit a birthday gift that compares to the gift that the Lord just gave them so HE DIDN'T! LOL. She constantly brags about what a great husband he is and he couldn't be arsed to get her a birthday gift. One of my babes was born right before my birthday and my family made sure I still felt special on my birthday and had gifts and tried to make it about me as much as they could, they didn't try to claim ""Well the Lord already gave you the best gift of all soo....""
* They've been up since 4 AM
* They had a newborn family photo shoot this morning with the photographer who did the maternity shoot
* Brit got up at 4 AM  and decided to just stay up snuggling M and let Jordan sleep because the night (or two she can't remember) before Jordan stayed up the whole night. Brittany thinks this is a helpful strategy for new parents. Sounds horrible and not at all sustainable unless you are two unemployed idiots. I have lots of newborn sleep tricks but I'm not dishing them out on here because I know she reads here. They deserve their sleep deprivation 🤪 And before anybody calls me out here... I will absolutely admit to having sour grapes! I got baby fever bad rn and wish I could be pregnant again rn. Also it's infuriating that Brit gets whatever she wants as God's most special girl when I know so many better, kinder, more capable and more deserving women who never got to have a baby after actually struggling with infertility for decades. 
* Jordan says the first week of 34 was not too glamorous. Today Brit did her makeup and hair for the first time since M. She now appreciates showers. Yeah that's real mom shit. Jordan says they are a very pro shower family? Wut? Who is an anti shower family? Jordan went two days without showering 😱 Brit says Jordan smells good for a man. He says, ""Got them pheromones!"" and Brit says, ""Yeah you do!"" EW 🤮 Jordan says Brit showers regularly but sometimes forgets to put on deodorant and Brit agrees. Jordan says sometimes when he hugs Brit he's like, ""What is that? Girl, put them arms back down."" LOL. And now we know she smells bad! Brit says, ""We're just here to keep it real, y'all!"" It's giving Paul and Morgan just ""keeping it real.""
* All Brit wanted for her birthday was to sleep in until 10. Jordan and his mom took M for a few hours and when she woke up there was a bouquet of roses and her favourite coffee in the bathroom because he knew she wanted a shower. Jordan then instructed her to get back in bed so he could make her breakfast in bed. Brittany always thought breakfast in bed was the coolest thing ever when she was a kid and nobody ever made her breakfast in bed until now. 
* The night before her birthday they had Brit's dad over to celebrate him. They said family and friends were over? Emma gave them that cookie cake for coming home from the hospital. To somehow celebrate Brittany's dad's birthday? Brit says again how they were in the hospital for four days and will share about that in the birth story. 
* They say again how Jordan couldn't top the birthday gift from the Lord. So he didn't bother trying lol. Brittany says the Lord was working on her heart ""because I'm not a materialistic person."" LOL. Since when? They one thing she wants for her birthday is a party. She loves parties. Note that earlier in this podcast she said the one thing she wanted for her birthday was to sleep in. Jordan says he hates every minute of parties. He is anti adult parties and Brit has beat him over the head with them. Wow what a match they make. Brit says she does that because she knows what it's like to not feel celebrated and to not appreciate life. Confirmation that she lives for attention and validation from other people. 
* Brit says they went on a walk through the stockyards on her birthday and probably pushed it a little too hard. Colour me SHOCKED that she is trying to exercise too hard freshly postpartum. 
* Brittany says she did have an episiotomy (ouch!), ""so that's not something to, that's not something to just, you know, you're not just going to jump up and go for a run after that."" Yeah no shit. Most moms don't get the clear for exercise, like running, until 6-12 weeks postpartum from a complication-free birth, something like an episiotomy can make recovery take even longer. She probably didn't bother listening to that part of the birth class because she didn't want to hear anything ""negative.""
* They then got tacos delivered from their friends for dinner. They've had a meal train and they won't know what to do when it ends. I still remember that one story Brittany posted about how she was delivering a meal to a new mom because she just knew one day it would be her turn. Friendship is so transactional with her.
* Jordan asks how her perspective has changed since being a mom, like with how different her birthday looked this year. Brittany says she's getting emotional thinking about ""their miracle"" 🙄 in the other room with her MIL, and about how precious life is. ""Just like, after a birth, like, how fast things went wrong. Life's a miracle."" I thought you only remembered the beautiful parts of childbirth? Because that's how women's bodies were designed or some bullshit like that? It's definitely a pet peeve of mine when people call their kids a miracle, unless they've actually gone through something miraculous. Being conceived through IUI is very run of the mill and not at all a miracle. 
* Brit says she would do *anything* for that baby. Would you go to therapy and genuinely fix yourself for that baby?
* Jordan tells the dad joke about how bad the dad beds are in the hospital rooms. His bed looked pretty fancy from the photo Brit posted. My husband had to sleep on basically a bench for the birth of one of our kids. He says, ""Which the only thing worse than a hospital bed are the guest beds, because those are the same beds they have in jail."" Brit says, ""And you know that cause you were a police officer."" Jordan says, ""Oh, thanks for clarifying. Viewers are going to be like, OH, he was in jail? Oh my gosh! That's not the worst thing they've thought about us. Who cares?"" Brit says, ""No. I know. Who cares?"" Jordan says ""Shoutout to the trolls"" 😈 hey we got a shoutout. He says, ""Can't do nothing about this one, y'all. Like go ahead. Come on!"" I'll *go ahead* and remind everybody that Jordan, as a police officer, slammed an innocent unarmed black mans head into the concrete after racially profiling him. You are a horrible, terrible person, Jordan. 
* Brittany says she was more worried about Jordan processing everything than herself. She says it's even been a lot for Jordan's mom and Brittany's dad. No mention of the other grandparents?
* Everybody is healthy. 
* Jordan, after telling Brittany not to give away what happened, says that 90% of their birth plan went according to plan. Something went almost too well? Brittany says Jordan knows what part she is talking about. I wonder if that part was their idiotic plan to transfer to the birthing center during transition labour LOL. 
* Jordan calls Brittany a ""hot mama at 34"" 🤮
* She has a Freudian slip and calls their newborn photoshoot a maternity shoot, and says she is still pregnant in her head. I just know she's going to miss the attention pregnancy got her. 
* Brittany goes on her prosperity gospel bullshit again. She says the Lord answered her prayers to a T in so many parts of her labor. Every little detail. ""Kim, there's people that are dying!""
* She now admits that there was ""a very good chance"" she was going to go past her birthday, when in a previous podcast she said M was *definitely* going to be born before her birthday. But now she has this new ""I prayed to be a mom before 34 for YEARS"" narrative to spin. 
* More prosperity gospel word salad
* Brittany says ""so I just really wanted to hop on here and encourage anyone listening, like He cares. And I know it's probably speaking to you, babe, on certain things already."" Sounds like Jordan has some unanswered prayers 🤔 After her word salad Jordan says, ""That was really well said, baby."" No it wasn't. 
* Brittany has a confession ""My quiet time right now with Jesus, it's just not..."" Jordan says, ""Yeah I think He knows your heart."" Brit says, ""There's so much grace, like, but that's been really, really hard for me."" She gets SO MUCH grace, but other people who do not subscribe to their warped, bigoted, prosperity gospel version of Christianity do not get any grace. Jordan says, ""It doesn't look like what it looked like before."" Brit says, ""No, and it probably never will. It probably never will."" She's never even finished reading the Bible after multiple attempts. Like how good was she truly at spending time with Jesus before M? Her rotten fruits say: not very. Also you know she thought she was going to handle it all way better than *those other moms* before she had M, and now she's realizing that she is in fact struggling the just the same as all the other moms. Motherhood is hard work, and we all know Brit isn't very good at working hard. 
* Brit says she is excited for prayer walks and ""I also can't wait for little picnics with M and just sunbathing with them."" Wow look at her using they/them pronouns 😂 Also I hope she doesn't give M a sunburn. 
* Brittany says M is a mini version of Jordan for her to hang out with while Jordan is at work 🙄
* Brittany says she is going to pray while driving to baby appointments. Doubtful but at least M is going to get some amount of healthcare by the sounds of it. 
* Brittany is praying over M when she wakes up to feed him in the middle of the night. Jordan doesn't ask for anything from God when he is up in the middle of the night with M, instead he is thanking God. Her and Jordan have such a ""heart posture"" for the Lord 🙄
* Brittany says M is probably sleeping because he just ate. This is a 30 min podcast and I'm assuming there was at least a little set up time. I guess cluster feeding hasn't hit them yet so that's something she can look forward to 😈
* They call M Brittany's ""present."" Jordan says, ""Go get your present."" Ew.
* The birth story is coming in the next episode",33,1743550902.0,brittanydawnsnark,7,0.98,False

April Fools has always been my little brother’s favorite holiday. Josh was the kind of kid who would wake up at the crack of dawn just to fill my shoes with shaving cream or put salt in my coffee. It was usually harmless stuff, and I’d always get him back. Last year, I put a fake eviction notice on his door and made him cry. He deserved it.

This year, I planned something even better. I found this old, creepy doll at a thrift store—porcelain, cracked face, eyes that didn’t quite line up. It was ugly as hell. I told Josh I found it in the attic and that Mom said it used to belong to “Aunt Claire.” We don’t have an Aunt Claire.

At first, he laughed. “Nice try.”

Then I took it a step further. I set an alarm for 3:00 AM and crept into his room. I placed the doll right next to his pillow, its cracked mouth an inch from his face. When he woke up, he screamed so loud the dog started barking.

Mom was pissed. “That was too far,” she said.

Josh wouldn’t talk to me all morning. When he finally did, he just muttered, “Not funny,” and shoved past me.

That should have been the end of it.

It wasn’t.

That night, I woke up to my door creaking open. I assumed it was Josh getting back at me. I groaned, rubbing my eyes.

“Dude, just get it over with.”

Silence.

I turned on my lamp. The doll was sitting on my nightstand.

Josh had left it there to freak me out. Fine. I picked it up, tossed it in his room, and shut the door.

I woke up again at 3:00 AM. My room was freezing.

I turned my head—and the doll was back on my nightstand.

I thought Josh had snuck in and moved it again. So I got up, stormed into his room, and threw it at him.

Except… he was already awake, sitting up in bed. He was pale, his eyes wide. “I didn’t move it,” he whispered.

I laughed. “Yeah, okay.”

Then he held up his phone. “I was filming, trying to catch you in the act. Look.”

He hit play. The screen was grainy, but I saw my own bedroom door. It never opened.

But the doll moved.

By itself.

It twitched, just slightly, like it was breathing. Then, slowly, it slid off my nightstand and onto the floor.

I felt sick. I ran back to my room and grabbed the thing, hurling it into the trash. I heard it crack.

That should have been the end of it.

But it wasn’t.

Because when I woke up the next morning, the doll was in my bed.

 ""I think he should advise every man ever on how to act as a man. 'cause he's the most perfect partner I could ever dream of. He doesn't feel real sometimes.”

Honestly, I don’t think Ashley is in love with ShSparkle. I will write a separate post about this later. She is SO EMBARRASSING! He doesn’t feel real because HE ISN’T REAL. He’s fake. 



On living with ShShunk: 

“It's been what, two months? Yeah. Okay. So I really do like love it so much. It's better than I could have ever imagined. I just feel like I love him more every day. Like yesterday was truly like the best day after he picked me up, he picked me up at work and he was actually off work… We came back to the house, we had sex on the kitchen counter. And then I went upstairs to change and pee. I come back downstairs. He had made me a snack, hummus and crackers. Is this Heaven? Like have I died? Like it's so I just love it. Both of us were like what a fun day. We had just random stuff. We ordered tacos. Like I just, and a lot of days are like that.” 

I’m in my hater bag right now, but THE VERY FIRST THING I THOUGHT when Ashley announced that her and ShShunk f\*cked on the counter was that that was the first time they had sex on the counter. And, um… I would have already effed on the counter within 2 days if I lived with some of the people I’ve been with. Sex on the counter certainly isn’t for everyone, but, like, did she get injured? Her hip bones, elbows, knees and bony flat ass shouldn’t be slammed against hard surfaces. 

Ashley will never be sexy, but she wants us to think that she is. SHE REALLY FELT SHE HAD TO LET LISTENERS KNOW THAT SHE HAD SEX WITH SPARX ON HER COUNTER to prove something none of us care about. I would think that they fuhk. They live together, are engaged and were always long distance.

Regarding crackers and hummus, I've said it before - it’s ALWAYS about what a guy has done FOR ASHLEY. It’s never the other way around. Still, I wouldn’t be won over by hummus and crackers. Someone can put that together in 3 minutes. 



On Shanky ruining her non-stick pans by cleaning them with steel wool:

“And then he was like, oh sorry I ruined your free pans. Because he knows they came from a brand partner…We're registered for those two fucking pants. Not even the whole set, just the two he ruined.”

I don’t think everything should be made available for public consumption. I think Ashley telling this story was incredibly rude and disrespectful and demeaning because it makes ShSugar Baby look like an idiot. I love that he clapped back, reminding her that she didn’t pay for those pans! It sounds like Ashley was surprised by that. I can’t imagine how much he bites his tongue.

No one should say anything in public that could embarrass their partner. It’s none of our business. And based upon what we’ve seen from Ashley on the podcast, like her wanting to pull her business form a perfume shop because of a coffee run, CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW ASHLEY WAS WHINING AND COMPLAINING NONSTOP OVER SHSHANK RUINING HER EFFING PANS? SHE. IS. INSUFFERABLE. She could have been kind to him in that moment. He didn’t intentionally ruin something she didn’t pay for.

Ashley is an idiot and I completely see her making a gift registry with two pans because she thinks something like that is hysterical and not emasculating at all. 🤡 ",2,1743549744.0,GirlsGottaEatRealTalk,2,0.75,False

1jp9zxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/1jp9zxb/yes_entj_4w5_does_exist/,"Yes, ENTJ 4w5 does exist.","As someone who consistently types as a ENTJ 4w5 on various tests, let me talk on behalf of the very contemplated and widely dismissed combination. It seems that some people tend to think introspection equals introversion. It also seems that some people think that ENTJs can't have that dual response to the world around them. So alas, here I am to explain how and why it is possible. 



I personally think that I developed into having 4w5 as my enneagram because of my upbringing. I was surrounded by ISFPs, ESFPs, INFPs, ENFPs, and ISFJs for the majority of my childhood. I'm not putting shame on these types, but under my circumstances these individuals weren't evolved. That meant from a young age, and in young ENTJ fashion- I was already thrust into a position to care for both people younger than me and older than me. I was the one who cleaned the house, scheduled events, ensured groceries were properly bought, and more.....from around age eight. I recognized then that the way I felt was a matter of private thought- because I had priorities to take care of first externally. This mindset mixed with natural youthful imagination led to a vast expanse of inner thought and contemplation that kept me afloat when I couldn't outwardly present myself as anything but reliable and mature. I didn't have room to be emotional, or exert creativity the way most kids could even just in trial. That being said....I still fit the bill needed. I've always been confident, upfront and externally forward in my opinions. I just had to ensure that my actions were also emotionally concentrated, because if they weren't the systems I had built that involved others (the ISFPs, ESFPs, INFPs, ENFPs, and ISFJs) would be dismantled because they were too 'demanding' without context. In example, it would be like me saying we should eat spaghetti for dinner- but that reasoning seemed selfish alone.....so I'd have to say that we should eat spaghetti because of a memory I had with someone else on a certain day. Everything became a catalog of how I could connect my emotions to my executive presentation without losing the authority I needed due to others gaining offense. I had to have the commanding nature of a dominating person, without dominating a room at all- so that when I needed to get things done I wouldn't be undermined by the assumption I was self-serving. Overall, that led to me feeling isolated young....not demonizing the emotions I felt, but using them alongside my need to build systems so that while they served their purpose they also brought me an emotional peace I couldn't find elsewhere. That's what made my combination possible. 



I'm not going to sit here and say that certain enneagrams are retrospectively impossible with certain MBTI, but I am going to say it's rare. It's rare and possible. If you study the systems at their core alongside human behavior, you'll find that contradictions can be made under the right stressors due to the way humans psychologically adapt. That's just fact. If you have any other questions or comments on this topic, feel free to share them. Until then I'll go back to my cold cup of coffee. ",0,1743549615.0,mbti,4,0.33,False

I remember them being small, maybe around 2-3 inches long. They were tan colored with dark brown spirals. I remember not having very much filling, if any filling at all. Possibly just a lining along the inside. The flavor was also definitely some sort of coffee or coffee product like tiramisu or cappuccino. There wasn’t any chocolate hazelnut filling or anything like that. Importantly, I also remember them coming in a brown plastic tray instead of metal tins you often see

For some context, I was born in the early 2000s so I think they were around then and maybe the early 2010s. I’m from the US but come from a Chinese background but I don’t believe they were an Asian brand.

My district manager has been caught making up policies a few times. A few examples are things like specific hair rules where every partner is supposed to wear a hair net if their hair is past a specific length, regardless if they put it in a pony or a bun, I personally have been threatened with being sent home because my blue jeans “weren’t blue enough” (not washed out jeans but just your average ordinary blue jeans that I have worn the same color of over my 4 years at the bucks), and my store still isn’t allowed to have personalized name tags at all. Just white chalk marker on black tag. If you are caught with one you get a write up. 

With all this being said, today we are now forced to not start a drink until the sticker prints out of the machine and is on the cup. I understand the sequencing of putting the sticker on the cup so don’t come at me for that, but as a drive through store who is constantly harassed for drive times (we have consistently been in the mid 30’s every single day for months during our peaks of 80+ customer half hours), there is no logical reason why we can’t start a drink once we here the customer order it on the headset. How the hell are we supposed to do our job and get fast times if we have to wait an extra 30 secs to start making the drink because little Timmy can’t decide what flavor cake pop he wants. There is literally no winning, either we get coached and drilled on how to decrease our drive times, or we get punished for starting a drink “to early” for god knows what reason. 

On top of that, once peak is over, we are now forced to switch the routing so that all of our mobiles, drive, and cafe drinks all come out of ONE sticker machine. I know that works for some stores but for a store with what I would consider a high volume through most of the day, this is awful. Having to explain to a customer why they have been waiting for 5 minutes at the window for a single drink because our poor one person bar has to stay in sequence with all of the stickers coming before their iced coffee is so defeating.  

This among the price increases, the item discontinuations, and just total lack of support for partners, is so draining as an employee who legitimately used to love this job. 

I miss being able to connect with my regulars. I miss feeling like I was quick and able to keep times down while still providing someone a delicious drink.

So, what does this longevity-boosting diet look like? It's a vibrant tapestry of colors, textures, and flavors, starting with the antioxidant powerhouses: **Blueberries**, bursting with anthocyanins, and leafy greens like **Spinach** and **Kale**, packed with vitamins and DNA-repairing compounds. Add in a daily dose of healthy fats and minerals with **Walnuts**, **Almonds**, and **Cashews**, and don't forget the omega-3 rich **Salmon**, **Sardines**, and **Mackerel** for brain and heart health.

To boost your body's natural detoxification processes, incorporate **Broccoli**, **Brussels Sprouts**, and **Cabbage**, all cruciferous vegetables brimming with beneficial compounds. Spice things up with **Turmeric**, harnessing the anti-inflammatory power of curcumin, and indulge in **Dark Chocolate (85%+ Cacao)** for a flavonoid-rich treat that supports blood flow and brain function. Drizzle your meals with **Extra Virgin Olive Oil**, a Mediterranean staple loaded with heart-healthy fats and antioxidants.

Nurture your gut microbiome with **Kimchi**, **Sauerkraut**, **Yogurt (Plain, Greek)**, and **Kefir**, all fermented foods teeming with probiotics. Sip on **Green Tea** and **Matcha**, both packed with catechins that repair DNA and reduce inflammation. Enjoy the creamy goodness of **Avocados**, full of monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, and savor the unique compounds in **Pomegranates** that enhance mitochondrial function.

Explore the world of medicinal mushrooms with **Reishi Mushrooms**, known for their immune-boosting and anti-cancer properties, and **Lion’s Mane Mushrooms**, which support nerve regeneration and brain function. Make legumes a staple with **Lentils**, **Chickpeas**, and **Black Beans**, all high in fiber, plant protein, and heart-healthy compounds. Dive into the ocean's bounty with **Spirulina**, a seaweed rich in omega-3s and antioxidants, and add flavor and immune support with **Garlic**.

Don't forget the power of **Onions**, high in quercetin, and the daily ritual of **Coffee**, rich in polyphenols that improve mitochondrial health. Enjoy **Red Grapes** for their resveratrol content, activating longevity genes, and explore other mushroom varieties like **Shiitake Mushrooms** and **Chaga Mushrooms**, each offering unique health benefits. Incorporate sea vegetables like **Wakame Seaweed** and **Nori Seaweed** for iodine and mineral support, and consider **Chlorella Algae** for its detoxification properties.

Add variety to your plate with **Sweet Potatoes**, rich in beta-carotene, and **Beets**, which improve blood flow. Enjoy **Asparagus** for its glutathione content and **Artichokes** for their fiber and liver-supporting properties. Enhance your meals with spices like **Cinnamon** and **Ginger**, both known for their anti-inflammatory effects. Incorporate seeds like **Flaxseeds** and **Chia Seeds** for omega-3 fatty acids and fiber, and choose grains like **Quinoa** and **Buckwheat** for complete protein, fiber, and minerals.

1jp9qvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jp9qvz/free_at_last_from_recipes/,Free at Last - From Recipes?,"Last post today. It's been a couple of years now on my specialty coffee journey.

For most of that time, I've adhered  as rigidly as possible to the  recipes handed down to us by the legends - Saint Hoffman,  Meister Hedrick, Aramse and Blessed Asser Christensen.

And as a beginner, that is good. Learn the basics. 

But after some time, I began to feel confined and restrained. 

I especially hated 4 or 5 pour recipes requiring you pour certain amounts at 15 or 20 second intervals. Not that the coffee wasn't good but I felt aggravated with the process rather than calmly meditative.

Then there was the different opinions on dose, ratio, temperature, etc. 

Now,  informed not only by influencers from YouTube on high, but by experience, I'm beginning to break free of the bonds. 

I now approach almost any brew with my standard 6g to 100g filtered water from my fridge. I almost always grind courser than usually called for. 

I determine bloom time by roast level, coffee freshness, and bed appearance  When I think its ready, I  wait some more. No timer bondage.

I seldom time pours any more. I usually do several slow pours, letting the slurry drain down to about a centimeter or two of the top of the bed, then pour again, drain and repeat to target yield.  Down with timers!  (Not original. I think this is pulse pouring?)

My other approach also requires no timer. Bloom 2x to 3x dose weight. After about a minute, I slow pour half the water, wait until it is almost drained, then pour the second half. I may change slow pour to higher agitation if needed but just adjust on the fly. 

None of this is original nor am I rigid about it. But I can mostly adjust grind, temperature, and pour technique to get a very decent cup from almost any pour over  brewer at the first go with out a specific recipe. 

Learning how was easy. I followed recipes doggedly for two years. That, plus viewing freaking hundreds of hours of  YouTube coffee vids. Spend a couple of hundred dollars and the same in hours with brewing equipment. Not to mention aggravating all the Redditors in this subreddit with questions asked a hundred times before. (I do use the search feature sometimes but mostly don't in case physics has changed.😎

Not saying that I now have a degree in coffee snobbery or have nothing to learn. The next stage is likely that I learn how much I don't know. But now I think I can fairly claim I have graduated from specialty coffee inquirer to coffee novice.

Thanks all. 

Edit: To be clear  I will look at recipes for general guidance and especially troubleshooting or hacks. Just not shackeled to them.

My fiance and I are going to move into with my father to support him and ourselves better. It's a win-win for everyone. My father is only 51, yet he has started getting a lot more tired and forgetful due to health issues. For example, he would have burnt down his house on Christmas Eve if he hadn't decided to go home instead of spend the night at our place, as he'd left his kettle on the stove.

Because he is still so ""young,"" and definitely doesn't have any sort of full blown dementia or the like, we're not sure if there's anything we can do to keep him from using the stove or such. We figure we could get him an electric kettle that turns itself to a keep warm setting or something, because he makes tons of coffee. 

Are there any gentle ways to propose him not using the stove? I can try to cook more for him so he has less reason to use it, but I'm just not sure. Any other redirection tactics?",1,1743548747.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1. **Performance Boost**: Both the RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 offer significantly better performance than the GTX 1080, particularly in modern gaming and applications that leverage ray tracing and DLSS technology.

2. **Compatibility**: Your motherboard (Z370-A PRO) supports the newer GPUs, and your power supply should be sufficient as long as it has the necessary PCIe power connectors.

3. **Future-Proofing**: Upgrading to an RTX card will help you handle upcoming games and software that require more graphical power, ensuring your system remains relevant for longer.

While a RAM upgrade could also enhance performance, especially if you are running memory-intensive applications, your current configuration of 16GB (2x8GB) at 3000MHz is generally adequate for most gaming and productivity tasks. Therefore, focusing on the GPU will yield the most noticeable improvement in performance.""

The user experience is WAY more important than what you've planned on Trello. These points are CRUCIAL for a better experience in the game. There are so many things in this game that's simply isn't working and I can imagine how many people feel the same. See this list as a huge advantage and massive opportunity to fix your game. I can easily write another list for you if you'd like, but here's a ""few"":

* Please, make the fridges wider. If I'm not spending an eternity placing the trays perfectly, I won’t fit 3 in a row.
* The ""Q"" option moves the camera when you hit left or right click (SUPER annoying since it's supposed to lock your screen—why's it still moving?). I can send you a video of it.
* When placing the cooked meat from the tray (with other meats on it) BACK on the grill because it wasn’t fully cooked yet, the wrong patty is placed back. The most recent patty you pick up is the first patty you put down.
* The text on the screen in the kitchen is WAY too small. I can barely see what it says. I get such a headache reading the screen. This is a HUGE concern. The text has to be LARGER.
* Why aren’t the ingredients on the burger displayed in the same order everytime? That goes for drinks as well.
* We NEED an option to NOT display what drinks etc. the orders on the kitchen screen include. It’s irrelevant. It takes up a lot of space, which brings me to the next point:
* I don’t want to have to click on the screen to click when I’m done with an order. Let me tab out an order without first having to click on the screen, THEN tab it out. These tiny things are HURTING the user experience.
* You need to fix it so you can carry 2 items. Seriously. At least make it an upgrade thing.
* The trays have to be larger. Can barely fit 3 items on it.
* Why in god's name do I have to click the vegetable tray a thousand times to fill it up? Why would I only want to fill it halfway? One click = fill it to the top. Makes prepping less painful.
* The soda machine has to be wider. Do I have to explain why? (Hint: cups don’t fit!)
* Delete the necessity to close the fridge doors before leaving, just to stop the items from despawning. I understand it’s supposed to be ""realistic"" but prioritize the user experience. Such an annoying detail.
* Let the users know what the difficulties mean. We’ve been playing for HOURS and still don’t understand what it means. More customers? Shorter attention spans?
* Does more players = more customers?
* Lower the levels in the fridges in the kitchen so you can see what’s in them without having to JUMP.
* The screen in the kitchen is way too high. Moving the mouse up and down to check what’s on the burger a thousand times is NOT good user experience. Lower the screen -> less mouse movements.
* Let us change the layout of the table in the kitchen. What’s that tiny table on the table? It’s in the way. It’s unnecessary.
* Why do I have to add one stack of cheese at a time when filling the tray? Make prepping less painful. One click = instantly fill the tray. That goes for everything. The ketchup cans do it amazing.
* Don’t tell us we’ve leveled up DURING the gameplay. It’s distracting. Tell us this at the end of the day and make the icons we’ve unlocked LARGER during the summary. Everything is so goddamn small in this game.
* Speaking of, why can’t the soda be dispensed when we put the cup on the soda machine? It’s such a small, (again) annoying thing that slows down the gameplay.
* The temperature rising or being lowered doesn’t tell the user when it’s getting cold/warm. So we’re just gonna guess? How’s that a good experience? Why aren’t you making it easy for us by telling us in seconds(!) how long it is until the ice cream gets hot? Add a countdown above the ice cream. You’re not supposed to hold your mouse over it to see the countdown. 
* Why are the numbers of the reciepts in random numbers? This is such a bizarre thing. First order of the day = 1. Not knowing which one is highest priority when there's 10 orders on the desk is making you wanna quit the game. 
* No more need to hold your mouse over the sodas to see what’s in them. Add the text above the cup, and below that, add the countdown that shows when it gets warm. Same goes for coffee, fries, nuggets.
* You can barely see the difference between small, medium, and large fries. So many times I've had to go BACK with the fries because it was the wrong size. 
* Let us pour out the fries we’ve packed.
* Let us change how short the customers’ attention spans are.
* I’m not getting into the drive-thru today.
* When tabbing in and out of the Q option, there has to be a tiny icon on the screen showing if you're in or out of it. So many times I haven't been able to move because I'm still using the motion sickness option. Imagine that when the time is ticking.

**EXTREMELY IMPORTANT !!!!**  
***REMOVE having to hover receipts to see what belongs to them. There HAS to be checkboxes on the receipts that automatically get checked when you place an item on the tray. When all checkboxes are filled, it automatically checks the entire tray as DONE. When it’s the wrong thing, it shows a CROSS.***

***We need a countdown for each order so they don’t just randomly disappear from the screen. This was (and still is) very confusing when it’s happening.***

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Not trying to sound rude, but adding new features to the game won’t make it better for now. What matters most right now is making the game work from a user experience point of view. Once it’s no longer a pain in the ass to play, *that’s* when you start adding new features.

Let me know if you want another list, video demonstrations, etc. Your game has HUGE potential and I overall love your game, but let’s fix what’s important first.",0,1743548354.0,fastfoodsimulator,0,0.25,False

We are both looking for a casual hook up. We have a similar communication style and get the same humor.
He set up a day to meet and what to do and on the day cancels because he’s exhausted from work, but says we will reschedule for the following weekend. It never happened. 
It has been 3 weeks of random texting/sexting (very mild version I should add) mostly late at night. (He always texts me first)
We’ve exchanged “sexy” pics but whenever I say “let’s meet for coffee or boba to see if we even have chemistry… the response is “for sure we will” and then nothing happens.
I enjoy talking to the dude but at this point it’s so suspicious and odd. 
I haven’t talked to him in a while. I think things fizzled out.
I should add at one point (out of frustration) I sent him a friendly “this isn’t working out” message and blocked him, but I missed talking to him so I unblocked and apologized and he responded well.
But it isn’t the same. (Probably because of the block/unblock)
