1hh7pj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/1hh7pj5/caferestaurant_chefs_where_do_you_draw_the_line/,"Cafe/restaurant chefs, where do you draw the line?","I‚Äôm opening a small cafe, which has an incredibly small kitchen, and will focus mainly on a strong coffee program and simple lunch and breakfast fare: lunch will be hot and cold sandwiches, and breakfast‚Ä¶well, that‚Äôs where my question comes into play. 

Our ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù has no vent hood, and we‚Äôll be using some combination of a toaster, a sandwich press, an air fryer or convection oven, and an induction burner. I met with a food rep yesterday, and many of the things he pitched to me, frankly, left me horrified‚Äîa pre-cooked fried egg, for instance, that I ‚Äújust gotta take outta the package and microwave!‚Äù This would then go, per his suggestion, onto the pre-cooked and reheated biscuit, with a hunk of pre-cooked and reheated fried chicken. I‚Äôm not interested in this kind of food for my space, but his suggestion, I think, was more of an example.

I understand the culinary world well enough to know that everything‚Äîeven at high-level establishments‚Äîisn‚Äôt artisanal, local, and perfect. But I‚Äôm having a difficult time understanding where a ‚Äúreal‚Äù chef, whose name is on the food that hits the table, draws the line on this stuff. Obviously this is at least partly subjective, and much of it depends on what and where you‚Äôre cooking. I know chefs who are food-obsessed who constantly use their air fryer at home. Air fryer =/= crappy food‚Äîat least not automatically.

I don‚Äôt want to reinvent the wheel‚Äîhence going after sandwiches, which can be simple *and* of a high quality at the same time‚Äîbut I‚Äôm concerned for what my rep says my breakfast menu needs. Pre-cooked bacon over raw? A bag of pre-mixed eggs, over ordering eggs and having my staff hit them with an immersion blender? Not fresh avocados for an avocado toast, but a sealed package of mashed avocado? The argument here is that it creates consistency and thus stability, as well as speeds up the process. 

How do those of you who run kitchens you‚Äôre proud to put your name on navigate this? I‚Äôm especially interested in your experience or feedback as it relates to breakfast‚Äîand, most especially, eggs and some kind of protein. I want to have our staff make eggs to order, but my partner is scared that ‚Äúone mess-up slows the next eight orders down.‚Äù I‚Äôd like to avoid pre-cooked bacon (thinking of Kenji‚Äôs sous vide bacon, which can ‚Äúcook‚Äù overnight in the bath and then get crispy in 2-3 minutes), but I imagine my partner will think that‚Äôs too much/too intensive, too. 

This is a small spot, and it‚Äôs hard to imagine we‚Äôll ever be more than 10-12 tickets deep.

Sorry for the long post, but, genuinely want to do right by this space and our customers, and also want to gain insight into my own blind spots.

Thanks!

Edit: to clarify, my hopes/expectations for this space are that the food is simply *good.* The food rep said a lot of this stuff is what ‚Äúnice hotels use‚Äù for their continental breakfasts. In my mind, that caliber of food fails to achieve the quality I‚Äôm aiming for. ",1,1734545445.0,Chefit,0,1.0,False

1hh7lbe,https://i.redd.it/7jky8wo8dn7e1.jpeg,Dr. Joe Dispenza appreciation post! ,"Helllooo lovely people! It was about 3 years ago when I heard someone speak about Dr. Joe ‚ÄúBreaking the Habit of Being Yourself‚Äù. I got really interested in it and got the book. It seemed very solid and full of backed up examples and guides. So, I started reading more and putting the knowledge into practice. 

Of course it hasnt been the perfect journey, but I have noticed a very big difference in my consciousness. It‚Äôs been expanded. I have come to realize that when we read, meditate and practice - it does take some time to let it all click and all of a sudden after some time we may have this BIG SHIFT and understanding of something new. 

I believe I have been able to really grasp the concept and truth of everything being a Frequency and Vibration and that when you change your energy, you change your life. This is so true. Have you ever felt like your surrounding literally reflects back to you exactly how you feel and the state you embody? 

For example, you wake up, spill the coffee, the traffic is taking too long, someone cuts in front of you, etc- you know it goes on and on all day. 

Also, the day when you woke up, meditated, wrote in your gratitude journal, regulated your nervous system, and you noticed how everything went so smoothly in your daily life. 

Of course, not everything may be perfect, but I‚Äôve come to realize that when you dedicate at least 30 minutes to an hour a day to yourself in the beginning of the day, you set the tone of the day for yourself and you make this is a habit, you will see noticeable changes over time. 

You become more conscious who you let in in your life (people with lower frequencies or those who are misaligned will fall out of your life). Have also learned to let them go. Being detached to the outcomes also has helped me. Not attaching myself to outcomes has actually given me so many results- job interviews, having certain people connecting with me, finances. I just trust and EMBODY that state. 

Also, I have cut out watching or listening to too many teachers. I just pick one or too and trust their work. I have been to one week long event in Denver in July, 2023, and one advanced event at Marco Island this year. It was absolutely amazing and I loved the community and seeing how humble Dr. Joe was. He really is a great example of a true teacher and leader.  And I love how he emphasizes on US being the doer. 

So yeah, keep doing the work. Don‚Äôt give up on your goals and dreams. They are there for a reason. Much Love ü§çüôèüèºü§ó",5,1734545140.0,DrJoeDispenza,0,1.0,False

I'm on the search for a serious friendship with someone who I click with and we just get it. Someone who has the time and effort to invest in creating a lasting bond, who I can be my silly self around without worry about being judged.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

A little about me:

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 24-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule

Ello ello! My name is Lewis, I'm 30 and from the UK, more specifically the North West.

I'm on the search for someone like minded and just ""gets it"". I'm searching for that connection, that something which just makes you want to fall into things deeper.

I'm interested in getting to know each other on a deeper level, go on dates, have fun and just enjoy life! At this point where I am in my life, I just want to be happy with the person I choose to spend the rest of my life with.

I know what I want from a relationship and I'm not afraid to show it. Someone to be by each others sides through thick and thin, the good and the bad. Who understands you've got to weather the stormy seas to enjoy the good in life.

I work a crazy schedule so I'm available all hours of the day throughout the week.

I value trust and honesty above all else in a relationship. If I can't trust you, what's the point? I'd much rather be hurt than your brutal honesty than your lies and attempts to soften the blow. With that said, I'm not interested in wasting yours or my time. So I'll get it out of the way now that I have a 4 year old child from a previous relationship.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it

I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

A little about me:

5""10, 75KG, slim/athletic build, blue eyes, medium length brown hair/beard.

Selfie time so you can see my in the flesh: https://imgur.com/a/Z17J0qs

When I leave the house I enjoy exploring, hiking, cycling, swimming, trying new experiences, being in nature and going to gigs/festivals.

Some of the stuff I enjoy:

- Hiking/cycling - I love being outdoors
- Listening to heavy metal/rock
- Computer programming (self taught, wanting to turn it into a career. Making my own android game)
- Watching documentaries/anime (give me your best, I need some new shit to watch)
- Playing games (PC gamer at heart. Played a lot of OSRS, Minecraft, Rust to name a few).
- Board games (Terraforming Mars, Scythe, D&D, Gloomhaven etc)

I'm also 420 friendly and enjoy partaking in the devils lettuce.

This year I'm looking to start the gym full time, go rock climbing/bouldering, learn to play the drums and finally get my driving licence!

I'm also in the process of completely redecorating my house from top to bottom. No car but I do have a house.

What I'm looking for in you:

24-34 (not opposed to younger/older but looking for around my age). You don't have to be the same continent/time zone. I'm open to LDR but it has to be with intention. Similar interests and hobbies.

More importantly, you're interested and ready to put in the effort to get to know each other with the intention of things progressing to something serious.

If you're interested in chatting, pop me a quick message and we'll see how things go :).",1,1734544539.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

Here's the thing... If Bitcoin is ever gonna achieve widespread adoption beyond 'digital gold' i.e. as everyday currency, then a whole bunch more people need to wrap their heads around it, and goods and services need to be priced accordingly.

In reality, most things would need to be priced in Sats, not Bitcoin. What does that even look like on the coffee shop menu? 4000 sats? or 0.00000004 BTC?

People are already nervous about self custody and accidentally sending the wrong amount to the wrong address etc. Those crazy decimals won't reassure anyone.

BUT 'Bitcoin' is the brand name, right? It'd be strange to live in a world where Bitcoin is the currency but to all intents and purposes it's really Sats. No, people need to talk about paycheques, purchases, savings etc. in terms of **Bitcoin**.

Right now, there are still lots of people who mistakenly believe you need $100k to own any Bitcoin. Explaining that they can buy (or spend) 1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin is a bit of a head fuck. Plain old dollars and cents seems so much simpler.

So... is it time to change the denomination?

1 Sat (old money) = 1 BTC.  
1 BTC (old money) = 1 MegaBitcoin (or some other name)

Redenomination is a process currencies like the Turkish lira have gone through in the past.

Advantages:

‚Ä¢ BTC pricing becomes more intuitive for the masses e.g. a coffee is 4 BTC  
‚Ä¢ People who are still on the sidelines might be more readily persuaded to get involved when they can own multiple whole coins  
‚Ä¢ Cements the brand name  
‚Ä¢ Whole coiners get to be megacoiners  üòù

And yeah, I get it. Current Bitcoiners are perfectly happy stacking sats. And they get a warm glow of satisfaction if they own a whole coin. But I'm not convinced it's idiot-proof enough for mass adoption. Tell me why I'm wrong.",0,1734544399.0,Bitcoin,4,0.25,False

But...how on earth as moms do we find time to really, truly relax? I am EBF and so can never leave the baby for more than 3 hours at a time with someone else...if I do, I need to pump and plan other things in advance to just step out the door. I have many hands willing to 'help' and hold the baby for a few hours while I nap (for which I am so grateful) but I just feel so worn down, and like my life is lived in small chunks of rest time (mostly sleep to catch up for the night wakes) while everyone else's default is to live their lives normally with chunks of time to look after the baby. I tried to explain to my husband how jealous I was of his 9-day work trip to which he replied 'but I was working the whole time!'. Well yes, but...you ate dinner out with friends, had a peaceful walk each morning to the train, didn't have to pack a diaper bag and navigate around nap times to leave the house, you could get up whenever you wanted to make a coffee and drink it while hot...etc. I haven't read a book or seen a movie in months. Shows are watched in micro-parts while the baby naps on me, and immediately interrupted when he wakes. I started reading an article weeks ago that I found really interesting, and I still don't know how it ends. Even when someone takes the baby so I can have a bath, I can't switch my brain off and am researching sleep training, ordering new diapers and buying Christmas gifts from the tub...like now. Ha! 

I know that for EBF moms we need to be around to breastfeed, but it is just so exhausting and grinding. And I'm having a hard time articulating to the people around me why I feel the way that I do. They just seem perplexed, offer to hold the baby again for an hour (the micro rest!) and then the cycle repeats. 

So...fellow baby moms who are able to fill their cups. How do you do it? How do you actually detach and take a real break? Again, I know how fortunate I am to have my 'village' but I still just feel so incredibly worn. ",5,1734544221.0,Mommit,6,1.0,False

Spike couldn't believe it he is meeting a region champion! ""Now then about your Pokemon"" Cynthia began. Spike then shook his awestruck state and paid attention ""Now based on how many badges you have you are clearly underprepared to handle team plasma or to help me"" Cynthia Cynthia then pointed to the water ""First of all you should catch some water type Pok√©mon to help diversify your team a bit...so here"" Cynthia handed Spike a fishing rod. ""Use that to fish up some Pok√©mon from the water""

""Thanks"" Spike took the rod and inspected

""Next. You should try to evolve more of your Pok√©mon."" Spike blushed at this he was told by others that he should have more evolved Pok√©mon. Cynthia then looked in the distance ""I better get going."" Cynthia then left Spike to his thoughts. He turned to the ocean

""Fishing wasn't something that I would have considered when it comes to catching powerful Pok√©mon but hey I am willing to try new things."" Spike then cast the line into the water few moments later he got a bite. Reeling it in Spike saw what he had caught.¬†[A Strange blue snake with wings on the side of its head](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dratini_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Learnset)¬†""What are you?"" Spike took out his dex to see what he is dealing with

""Dratini the Dragon Pok√©mon. Dratini continually molts and sloughs off its old skin. It does so because the life energy within its body steadily builds to reach uncontrollable levels."" The Dex informed

""Huh...Well I have room for two more so welcome aboard little guy"" Spike threw a net ball to catch the water snake dragon Pok√©mon. It didn't seem to resist Spike smiled with what he caught.

""HEY BOSS CHECK IT OUT!"" Buddy yelled getting his trainer's attention. Spike looked at Buddy who was pointing at a small yellow rat Pok√©mon

""I have seen a Pikachu Buddy...what's so special about this one?""

""He's like me!"" Spike eye's buldged at this ""Yeah. A Partner Pok√©mon!"" Spike smirked And tossed a luxury ball...while it did in fact caught the Pikachu...It immediately got out of it's ball.

""DON'T JUST DO THAT!"" The Pikachu yelled.

""Sorry Sorry. Listen Storm-"" Spike began  
""Bolt. my name is Bolt."" Bolt interrupted

""Huh came with his own chosen name. Anyways Bolt you know how these things work.""

""Yes I do but I am only getting in the ball when I have to."" Bolt nodded and said in understanding

""Why did I encountered another Partner Pok√©mon?"" Spike then shrugged ""Well Another Dragon Type is always welcome. Besides I have a ground type already""

""Yeah, though it would be a good idea to use water."" Buddy stated ""Looks like David finally get a turn.""

""Right back to Town and prepare to head to Route 112"" As the group head back to Dewford Town. Twilight spoke up

""Pause."" The play back paused ""So What about Rayquaza?"" Buddy nodded at this question

""We couldn't really do anything about him yet seeing that we were too weak at the moment and luckily the Cynthia and the Champion of the Honen region, were keeping Plasma busy."" Buddy answered. ""And lucky for us the play back isn't going to show you the training moment we have that would get repetitive. The playback will skip to us in Lavaridge Town. Where we faced Flannery, and Pee Wee evolved into Blaziken""



# Spike the Jumper: The Shy yet Determined Fire type Gym Leader VS the Dragon Assistant

""Uhhh you okay?"" Spike asked with concern

""WORRY ABOUT YOURSELF FOR YOU ARE ABOUT....About to...get burned? YEAH GET BURNED!!!"" Flannery roared with vigor and enthusiasm

""How long have you been a gym leader?"" Flannery puffed her cheeks

""Not important! THREE Pok√©mon!"" Spike Shrugged and was reaching for Trapinch until Bolt and Buddy stopped

""Boss I know you want to send your ground and Water types but..""

""Buddy and I want in. Pee Wee is itching for a fight to."" Bolt explained. Spike took a moment to consider before nodding.

""Sure I mean You two can handle Fire types."" Buddy dismounted Spike's Head, Bolt stood next to Spike and Pee Wee emerged from his ball. ""Well here's my three....Bolt you go first.""

""TIME TO RUMBLE!"" Bolt said ready for action. Flannery Snickered at the mouse Pok√©mon's energy

""Slugma you're up"" Bolt couldn't help but giggle at the fire slug. Flannery Had no idea what was going to happen ""Rock throw."" Spike swallowed his pride and yelled the attack he was going to use

""Splishy Splash!"" Bolts cheeks sparked causing the water molecules in the air to congregate and form a large wave. hitting the Slugma while also dodging the Rock Throw....and as luck would have it Slugma was Paralyzed.

""WHAT THE?! WHAT MOVE WAS THAT!?"" Yeah now Flannery was panicking she has never heard of Splishy Splash before and by the looks of it is a water type move that has a chance to paralyzes the target.

""That's just the start. Finish it off with Iron Electro Ball."" Bolt generated Electricity and created shocking ball of Lightning that is launched for his tail and hits the fire slug and knocking it out. ""Wow...Dang Bolt.""

""Uhhh. D-DON'T GET COKCY! NUMEL!"" A yellow Camel Pok√©mon was released. Spike paused Almost as if he was making a judgement call.

""Okay then use Iron Tail."" Flannery then grinned

""Earth Power."" The Ground underneath Bolt Erupt dealing serious damage.

""That was a ground type move."" Spike was horrified "" Bolt come back!""

""Right....."" Bolt retreated back to Spike's Side

""Pee Wee. You're up."" The Combusken nods and moved onto the Battlefield. ""Now then Double Kick!""

""Sunny Day!"" The sun began shine bright. Numel took the hit and Spike was confused as were the Mane Six

""Why did you do that?"" Spike asked

""Why did she do that?"" The Mane Six asked

""This is why. Lava Plume!"" Spike was confident at first then Pee Wee got hit and was sent flying

""That‚Äôs why Sunny Day causes the Weather Effect Harsh Sunlight. This means that all Fire Type moves are 50% more stronger and all Water Type moves are 50% Weaker."" Buddy Sighed ""Looking back at it now. It was a good Idea to not let David Battle Flannery That would make all of his Water Type moves weaker....Though It was a good thing that Pee Wee was out and not Bolt.""

""Yeah Fire Type Pok√©mon are immune to the Burned Status effect""

""Okay....that makes things difficult Flame Charge!"" Pee Wee Enwreathes himself in flames and charged at Numel

""Earth Power!"" Pee Wee Thankfully was able to hit the camel before its attack could fire off. However he began to feel funny....like he was relaxed and yet was in pain. He began to glow

""OH YES! IT'S HAPPENING!!!"" Pee Wee yells in enthusiasm

""So Pee Wee what did you become?"" Twilight asked the little phoenix chick. Pee Wee chuckled then in a dramtic voice, points to the screen and Spoke

""Behold my final form. The terror of competive play. The banned fighter. Firey Speed Demon.¬†[BLAZIKEN](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Blaziken_(Pok%C3%A9mon))!""

Once the evolution was done. Pee Wee took a moment to give himself a look over ""I look awesome! Hmmm ah yes. Boss give my moves a look over!"" Spike did as instructed looked at Pee Wee and nodded

""BLAZE KICK!""

""Earth Power!""

This time however both attacks hit their intended targets. But in the end Pee Wee was still standing and numel was out cold. The Ref nodded

""Numel is unable to battle and Flannery is out of any usable Pok√©mon. Which means Spike wins!""

""ALRIGHT!"" Bolt cheered

""That was close"" Pee Wee stated a bit exhausted

""Man....I guess I still have a ways to go"" Flannery bemoaned but smiled ""Well done challenger. Here's your badge"" Spike received his 3rd badge.

Pee wee that was with Twilight then spoke up ""At the time we were thinking that nothing could stop us now. Man Norman put us in our place when we got to him""



# Spike the Jumper: Ending up in Orre and Aid from the Flaming Lord of the Sky

""Hey wait"" Spike then realized ""That was only two Pokemon."" Flannery's eyes went wide then blushes from embarrassment

""Forget about it.""

The Mane Six giggled at this

""So y'all headed to face that Norman Fella right?""

""We were"" Pee wee Stared but half way to Petalburg. We were Shanghaied"" The scene shifted to show Spike and his Pokemon making their way tp Petal burg before a group of¬†[men](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/File:J_henchmen_DP020.png)¬†snatched Buddy away and road off into the sea on a strange flying machine/ Spike and his Pokemon were able to get back Buddy but as a result they were nowhere near Honen. So Panic set in

""HOW ARE WE TO GET BACK?!"" Spike screamed. with despair. Luck was not with him because if he was right the only way back is by boat and the only ocean liner that is heading back to Honen wouldn't be taking aby fares for another month. AND HE DIDN'T HAVE A MONTH! Ore was mostly waste lands and roads. So what can he do.

""I heard that a large bird flies above Orre every two years near"" A strange teen girl wearing yellow clothes said. Spike tuned to her.

""Huh?""

""Yeah. and I just so happen to know a way to get Its attention."" Spike in his desperation believed this stranger. Luckily for him the girl was empathetic. ""Right Just wait for me near that karge tower. And we'll get started."" She seemed to teleport away. Spike hitched a ride to get to said¬†[Tower](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Realgam_Tower). ""Wow eager to leave huh? I can't blame ya I'll be leaving this place soon too."" she began the process which seemed to be a strange dance and song. That sounded like a prayer

However as the process the began the playback played¬†[music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgU5LyIhmc4).

The Girl:

Let our voices rise up like the sun  
Call to the heavens where the rainbow lies  
Now we implore you, flaming lord of the skies  
Grace us with your flight  
Bring us heaven‚Äôs light

Let our voices sing of grand rebirth  
Flame, rain, and lightning were brought back from the fall  
Now we implore you, bring your sacred fires to all  
Grace us with your warmth  
Grace the sacred earth

HO-OH!

(Stop Music here)

Spike panicked as the bird of rejuvenation descend to them

""Child of Honen's long, renowned history."": Ho- Oh began ""I can sense your plight. You wish to go back home and face on of my brethren. ""

""Y-Yes""

""Very well I will help you but I wonder. Have you the strength to rise up to challenge to Sky Dragon ?"" Ho- Oh said his head titled. ""And why would you go after Rayquaza?"" Ho-Oh's eyes closed before opening them again ""I see this 'Team Plasma' seeks to use his power for their purposes...it must be to awaken the Dragon of Ideals. Ver Well. Hop on my back and I shall fly you back to Honen. But if your travels bring you to Johto...You are free to challenge me to prove yourself worthy of the flames of rebirth."" SPike looked confused ""I think the proper terminology to use would be a chance for you 'Catch' me."" Ho-Oh clarified ""As for those cretins I shall face them when the time is right so that you shall deal with Rayquaza. Now get on."" Spike mounted Ho-Oh making sure that Buddy and Bolt were in their pokeballs. And the Rainbow flew spike back to Honen....however something was off about this detour

""Say"" Pinkie finally spoke ""Does anyone feel like someone wanted Spike out of the way, for something"" Buddy sighed

""Yep because after Norman we found out what that something was""



# Spike the Jumper: Plasma's Plans, Meeting Bolt, And meeting Sunset's Starter Pok√©mon

""What was it that they needed you out of the way for?""

""Sunset....You have been quite this whole time. So why don't you tell them. After all, You and Flash Sentry was there."" Buddy suggested

""SO WAS SOMBRA....Sigh but you're right I have more info on the Pokemon Franchise than Flash"" Sunset took a deep breath. ""First off, Teem Plasma was working with both Aqua and Magma to wake Up Kyogre and Groudon."" She took out her Pokedex to show images of¬†[Both](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kyogre_(Pok%C3%A9mon))¬†[Pok√©mon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Groudon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)). ""Both are legendary and there is only one Pokemon that would intervene to stop them. Rayquaza.""

""I get it. Team Plasma is using Team Aqua and Team Magma to Draw out Rayquaza"" Twilight said with Wide Open.

""DUH!"" A new voice spoke up as A new figure decided to make its presence known. Pee Wee sighed knowing who it was

""Bolt...When did you get here?"" The Pikachu walked up to the group with a cocky grin

""Just now"" Bolt said with honesty. ""I didn't come alone either They can offer incite what Sunset was doing while Spike was having his journey"" Sunset sighs

""Who?"" Sunset question was answered by the appearance of what can be described as a¬†[Bipedal Fox Wizard](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Delphox_(Pok%C3%A9mon)). ""Inari Welcome to Equestria.""

""Hello."" Inari turns to Bolt. ""I am surprised that you bring your harem Bolt.""

""They'll show up soon. But first lets get back on track""



# Spike the Jumper: Norman's Challenge

""BUT"" Bolt interjected ""That was after Norman who is the next gym leader. AND MAN WAS HE HARD! The Team the Spike went with was Pee Wee, Geo and David"" The Scene Shifted to Spike facing Norman ""And at first Spike was going to have this in the bag....but Just Like Whitney there was a catch.""

""Three Pok√©mon.""

""You too? You're like the third person who only uses three Pok√©mon.""

""Oh I have more but my better team is for those who have 7 badges. So you got your three picked?""

""Bolt, Buddy. Stay on the Sidelines.""

""Seriously?"" Bolt groan

""COME ON!"". Buddy Complained

""Trust me I have a team decided."" Spike said. the two partner Pok√©mon nodded and stood next to spike while he picked out three Pok√©mon. ""Okay Norman, I got my three decided""

""Right Slaking you're up!""

""David. Lets go!"" The Wartortle came out and was surprised by the Slaking before him ""Water gun!""

""Retaliate""

""Sooooo."" Buddy Started ""Remember what I said about STAB?""

""Yes"" Everyone said at once.

""Retaliate is a normal type move so when Slaking use it it benefits from STAB....but there was one issue.""

Sure the Water Gun made contact but the Retaliate insta-KOed David

""WHAT THE WHAT?!

""Slaking is VERY STRONG!"" Bolt finished his thought. ""Now that threat of Norman is clear....but there is hope""

""Okay....David Return. Pee Wee your up."" The Blaziken stood on the battle field ready for a fight ""Double Kick!"" The Two Kick connect but didn't made the Ape Knock out...Surprisingly Norman didn't issue an order. As Slaking just longed around.

""Huh?"" Applejack tilted her hea in confusion ""What's the deal with the big ape.""

""Truant."" Bolt Answered ""This means that Slaking won't act as much in fact half the time he will be lazing about instead using move""

""Uhhhhhh....Well its a gamble. HIGH JUMP KICK!"" Pee Wee leapt high in the hair and preformed a kick. Flash has called this kick a¬†[Rider Kick](https://www.deviantart.com/professorzolo/art/RIDER-KICK-903018077). When the Kick lands it knocked out the Slaking. ""One down...two to go""

""Vigoroth! You're Next"" The next Pok√©mon was more energetic than

""Vigoroth might be more energetic but not as strong as Slaking, But it makes up for it because of its ability. Vital Spirit. It can't be put to sleep by any Pok√©mon move....also It doesn't have Traunt.""

""Time for the new move! BLAZE KICK!"" Pee Wee's :right leg ignited with flames and delivered a round house kick to Vigoroth....Shocking Norman how fast Pee Wee was ""Surprised? You should be. For my Blaziken is very fast!""

""I can see that. Furry Swipes"" Vigoroth claws glowed.

""FIRE PUNCH!"" Spike assumed a fighting stance....and basically Pee Wee does¬†[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEArV9rspF0)¬†as he traded blows with Vigoroth. When the assault ends Pee Wee was out cold.

""Down to one I see.""

""Omae wa mou shindeiru"" Spike said in an attempt to sound intimidating But ended up sounding Silly but.

""What?"" Vigoroth fainted shortly afterwards. ""Huh> So now we are both on our last Pok√©mon. SLAKING!""

""YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE!"" Spike Gulped the First one gave him so much trouble. ""Great.....Geo Lets make a Miracle happen."" Geo now a Gabite took the field. But Spike had an interesting idea ""SANDSTORM!"" Norman however smiled.

""Smart move but now you have fallen into my trap. ENCORE!"" Slaking began to applaud Geo

""Huh?"" Spike Shrugged ""Now use Dual Chop!"" but Geo used Sandstorm again ""Geo what are you doing""

""Encore. It forces a Pok√©mon to use the last move they used. Three times in a row"" This cause Spike to Panic a bit as Slaking Longed a bit and Geo used Sandstorm for a second time ""Yawn"" Slaking yawned in Geo's face. Causing the Shark Dragon to get Drowsy after it used Sandstorm for a third time.

""Okay ENOUGH OF THIS! DUAL CHOP!"" This time finally free from Encore the Gabite used Dual Chop but it barely did any damage to the Slaking....and as a result of Yawn he fell asleep. However Norman was on the timer. Sandstorm was still in effect. However Geo had one more trick up his sleeve

""Now Retaliate"" Slaking took a swing....AND IT MISSED! ""Hmm care to explain?""

""Sand Veil."" Spike said with a grin ""While there's a Sandstorm Geo's Evasion is increased in this case it means your attacks are less accurate""

""I see I just have to out last the storm."" Spike eye's went wide with shock ""Uhh Geo Wake up!"" the Land Shark didn't respond

""He's gonna be out for a while. Retaliate!"" This time the attack hit ""Again!"" Another hit but...Geo's eye opened it was awake and very angry and Grumpy

""THAT HURT!"" Geo roared

""BULLDOZE!"" Spike said pointing to Slaking

""Gladly"" Geo stomped on the ground causing the ground strike Slaking...lowering its Speed.

""Retaliate!"" Slaking Swung at Geo who quickly dodged it

""Hmmm. He seems close to defeat."" Spike nodded to himself ""DUAL CHOP!"" Just as Spike expected Slaking fell to the attack. Norman nodded with approval

""Well done. You have earned-"" A roar interrupted the festivities.

""And thats when we had no choice but stop our journey to become a Pok√©mon champion for a while."" Buddy said with annoyance

""Why"" Pinkie asked very curious

""Because we just got dragged into stopping an evil teams plans....which then lead to another team and then to....well watch and see"" Bolt answered



# Spike the Jumper: Meeting N, The Storm Begins and Chasing the Sky Dragon

Spike and Norman ran outside the gym. Everything was just crazy. There was a combination of harsh sunlight and torrential rain. ""WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!""

""Team Magma and Team Aqua...they have completed their goals and woke up Groudon and Kyorge"" Spike and Norman looked to the origins of the voice ""Sorry...I know you are curious but we don't have much time!"" The Green haired team then pointed to the skies ""Rayquaza is going to stop Groudon and Kyogre. But someone is going to take advantage of this...We must stop them.""

""Why should we trust you?"" Norman asked ""Who are you anyways?""

""I am N. And we don't have much time,"" N said with urgency as he points to the Skies again this time with Rayquaza visible to Spike and Norman ""We must follow him at once!"" Spike and Norman were a bit skeptical but didn't argue because this weather was affecting them. AND the Pokemon. Fire and Water Pokemon were noticeably stronger and were acting more vicious than normal. This is became apparent when Pee Wee busted out of his ball with red eyes and sounding crazed

""FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!""

""Pee Wee. Whats wrong?!""

""MUST FIGHT! MAKE IT STOP!!!"" Spike immediately recalled Pee Wee back into his ball.

""Okay N lead the way"" The trio began running to keep up with the Sky Dragon



# Spike the Jumper: Shocking Reunion, Going to the origin point, and Preparing for the challenge

Everyone watching was on the edge of their seats as the scene plays out. Spike and N rushing through routes to catch up to Rayquaza thank fully The dragon wasn't flying fast unfortunately they were now at sea. N however Flags a ship to borrow and follow the Dragon . ""HEY!"" Spike noticed who was driving the boat and saw the strange woman from Orre. ""Didn't expect to see you here.""

""Oh hey.""

""Listen I take it you are after Team Magma and Aqua, Right?""

""Something like that."" Spike Nodded until he noticed something oddly Familiar about the woman ""Hang on...Sunset?"" The Woman sigh

""Yeah hi Spike"" Sunset sighed. ""Listen. Me, Flash and Sombra are also here. So expect to see them""

""Okay....""

""Anyways. Leave Kyogre and Groudon to Me and Flash."" Sunset said with a firm and stern tone

""That just leaves Rayquaza"" Spike Sighs

""Yeah...and Sombra is busy.""

""Don't worry. I'll Catch it."" Spike take out one of his three Master Ball ""I'll use this""

""A master ball. Okay great. So here's the plan. Me and Flash will keep Aqua and Magma busy, You go after Rayquaza.""

""Seeing that David, and Peewee are a bit crazed due to the weather that just leaves. Bolt, Buddy, Geo and......Gloria"" Spike sighed ""Anything else I should know.""

""Ho-oh said he would help us out with this but I don't See him"" Just then a bird screech echoed. ""Nevermind. Okay Ho-Oh will lead Rayquaza to the Origin Cave. So when we get there, you have a small window to catch it before Team Plasma get there. Any questions?"" Spike shook his head ""Okay now then Ready?""

""HEAVEN OR HELL?!""

""LET'S ROCK!""



# Spike the Jumper: The Creator of the Land vs Rule of the Sea, and Catching the Sky Dragon

As the group got closer the storm seemed to get worse ""We are close....THERE!"" Sunset pointed to two behemoths.¬†[One that looks like a Dinosaur](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Groudon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)),¬†[the other one looks like a whale](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kyogre_(Pok%C3%A9mon)).

""There they are but there is one problem"" Spike said searching the skies

""What's wrong?""

""I don't see Rayquaza."" Spike said with concern.

""I see him look."" N points to the skies where the sky dragon was clashing and against the Rainbow Bird

""Okay get going. Leave Groudon and Kyogre to Me and Flash"" Sunset points to a boat that was approaching the two legendary. Sunset then landed near the beach that lead to the Cave of Origin. ""So just relax and let me and Flash handle Groudon and Kyogre

""Okay good luck!""

""Inari!"" Sunset sent out a¬†[bipedal fox magician¬†](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Delphox_(Pok%C3%A9mon))""Flash over here!""

""Come on out Lagoon""¬†[A large blue amphibian like creature](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Swampert_(Pok%C3%A9mon))¬†stood ready

The two titanic Legendries felt the prescience of the two interlopers And glared Sunset turned her attention to Groudon. Flash had his sights set on Kyogre

[(Music for the arrival of Groudon and Kyogre)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y0bkckiXbg)

Groudon opens up with a Precipice Blades dealing massive damage to Inari.

""Tough it out and use Solar Beam!"" Sunset commanded.

""Hang on but doesn't it take time for-"" Spike was interupted when Inari fires a solar beam

""Muddy Water!"" Lagoon used what appeared to be mud version of Surf. hitting both Kyogre and Groudon,

Kyogre however countered with Origin Pulse Hitting Inari

""NO ONE HEARS THE WATERS CRIES!"" Sunset yelled ""FROM THE DEPTH THE EARTH SHALL RISE! Psybeam! on Kyogre"" The Psychic type beam attack hits the water legendary causing the Flying whale to lose altitude. but use ice beam on Delphox

""Laoogn intercept"" Lagoon obeyed Flash's command and got in the way of the ice beam taking the brunt of the attack ""Gasping for air"" Flash said omniously ""you struggle in vain. Use Ice Punch on Groudon"" the attack hits causing the large creature to staggar. ""Sunset.... I think we're ready. and Spike get ready."" Spike the noticed what Flash was talking about...Ho-Oh was able to shepard Rayquaza to Spike

""Now's your chance young one"" Ho-Oh said with urgency. Spike nods takes out a master ball

""Master Ball GO!!!"" The purple ball hit Rayquaza head bringing it inside and the ball landed in front of him. Despite the description of the Master Ball, Spike was on edge. As it wiggled and then laid still and dinged ""YES!"" Spike yelled to the skies ""I CAUGHT RAYQUAZA!"" He then heard similar Dings from Flash and Sunset

""Welcome aboard S∆°n Tinh"" Sunset said naming Groudon

""Let's get along Th·ªßy Tinh"" Flash did the same with Kyogre. Spike looked at his Master Ball containing Rayquaza

""You shall be Ryujin."" and Shortly after that the ball was sent to the PC Box. N sighed and whispered something in to a device. Buddy then nodded

""And this playback is going to skip a bit of filler us going to the Pok√©mon Center, Recovery, but after that we realized that by capturing Rayquaza we now had a target on our backs...the only way we can continue our journey to be the best we had to go to the Unova Region. To take on Team Plasma and Catching the White Dragon of Truth



# Spike the Jumper: Evolutions, Planning, and Arriving at the Unova region

There was a brief montage of Spike prepping for the rip to Unova but as a result of preparing Some of his Pok√©mon Evolve. Ethan evolved into a¬†[dragon with flame on its tail](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V2H4NWnKo95W8gdrZlUCg6pcbxw-ynwD/view?usp=drive_link). David evolves into¬†[large turtle with water guns in its shoulders](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ONe3C7CrqtOsGt8y-CDqnhu6HqhelL0v/view?usp=drive_link). George evolves into a¬†[large dinosaur with a large palm tree like plant](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lro6JHwpfjvxRAo6VZUCezrbNTBHhzks/view?usp=drive_link). Lenard became a¬†[Strange Dragon Fly like creature](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Vibrava_(Pok%C3%A9mon)).

""You can guess that Ethan was very happy after evolving."" Buddy stated.

""Sombra is already at Unova so we'll meet him there."" Flash Explained ""So here the plan once we touch down we have to act fast and find Plasma before they get the Legendary Dragon of Truth.""

""Okay quick question...Is there another Legendary Dragon?"" Spike asked

""Yes the Dragon of Ideals."" Sunset answered then paused ""But thats where the bad news begins their leader already has that Dragon. So we need to catch the Dragon of Truth before Plasma does.""

""Pause"" Twilight said then turned to Buddy "" Who is the Dragon of Truth and the Dragon of Ideals?""

""Reshiram. A Dragon and Fire type, the Dragon of Truth. Zekrom. A Dragon and Electric type, the Dragon of Ideals. Both are very powerful and dangerous."" Buddy then turned back to the play back ""BTW there is much left after Spike catches Resharim. Just Ho-oh, the remaining gyms and Elite Four. Plus one last montage for the final evolutions of the jump."" Buddy said.

""After that. Pinkie's Orb is next."" Max added ""We skipped Infamous Jump's recording because not much happens but here"" Max handed Twilight a stack of papers ""Spike figured you would be curious about what build he had in Infamous.""

# Spike the Jumper: A Wonderful Surprise Gift, and more guests

""It's getting late"" Goofy said noticing the sun going down. ""How about we continue this in the morning?""

""Good idea. I might be a bit late. got apples to harvest"" Applejack said . Every pony went their seperate ways..

""Pause."" Twilight said as she got ready for bed.

Next Morning

""TWILIGHT!!!"" Imagine Twilight's surprise when She heard Applejack's scream. Twilight shook her head and teleported to the map room to see a frantic face.

""AJ...What's wrong?""

""NEVER MIND THAT GO OUT SIDE YOU NEED TO SEE THIS!!!"" Twilight rolled her eyes and followed Applejack outside and then froze.

""It can't be"" Twilight said shock and tears in her eyes. Not too long after her guest arrived to se what was going on

""Oh yeah....so it finally arrived."" Fred said with a yawn

Twilight however had tears in her eyes ""It can't be"" Max Knelt down putting his hand on Twilight's shoulder

""Welcome to Spike Personal Abode...or rather. Welcome home Twilight. Welcome to ""

""[The Golden Oaks Library](https://www.deviantart.com/selenaede/art/Golden-Oaks-Library-311816861)."" Not long after the rest of the Mane Six shows and Discord teleports in.

""Is that?"" Pinkie asked

""Yes...it looks like it"" Rainbow said still dumbfounded

""So do you wanna go in or?"" Bolt asked.

""Yeah..."" Twilight said as she lead everyone inside. As everyone entered the shock, confusion, and joy had doubled. Because the inside was just like it was before Tirek. Like it was never destroyed. Sure there were different books on the shelves but here it was, her old home. But the happy moment was ended by the sounds of Snoring. ""Is someone here?"" As they investigate the source of the snoring they saw several people one was groggily waking up. Pinkie got in their face

""Hi!""

""[YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cmVh88bFPw)"" Whoever was sleeping was woken up by the scream. One was annoyed about being woken up.

""Pepino whats the commo- Oh We have finally arrived"" And there they saw him. The one that Spike made a bet with, The tyrant of the Crystal Empire, Sombra....and he was levitating a mug and walking toward the kitchen ""Ugh before any of you start let me at least have some Coffee. and Pepinno calm down and make some breakfast.

# Spike the Jumper: Explanations and Continuing the Story during breakfast

As everyone entered the kitchen, the Mane Six shifted their gaze to Sombra....who looked Domesticated. ""So did you bring the orb?"" He asked.

""oh yes."" Fluttershy said holding up her orb.

""Good.""

""NOW HANG ON JUST A DARN SECOND!"" Applejack said marching her way towards Sombra. ""What's your deal here. Kingy?"" Applejack asked ""Why are you in this library?"" Sombra sighed at the questions

""Well to be honest I was hoping to save this until after this orb was done. But whatever. Spike won the Bet."" Sombra explained.

""HE WON!?"" The Main Six exclaimed joy and disbelief

""Yes he did."" Sombra said with a look of 'I am so done with this right now' ""He successfully reformed me. Just after Pizza Tower. The Pok√©mon jump allowed me to make new friends. One however was more like my-"" then a sound was heard ""Sigh...he woke up"" Sombra placed his Coffee mug down and walked to a room where this small creature ran out ""Casper, slow down""

Sombra's declaration cause the Mane Six to jump a bit. Sombra took a moment to compose himself. ""The Rest of My Pok√©mon are still resting in their Pok√©balls. I would like to keep it that way for a while""

""So who are the rest of you? Where did you come from?""

""Well you already know my name"" Pepino started but Giovanni interrupted

""Nope! No Spoilers."" Giovanni said with a grin. Besides it would ruin the fun.

""There is something about what you said earlier that confuses me"" Sombra caught on to what Twilight was talking about.

""That I was successfully reformed after Pizza Tower?"" Twilight nodded ""You want to know why did the bet didn't end right there?"" Twilight nodded again ""We Promised to see it through till the end. I am really glad that we did.""

""ORDER UP!"" Pepinno said as he brought some pancakes and eggs "" I am not sure if I should make any meat while they are here. So no Bacon today.""

""This looks good."" Pinkie complimented

""Say how about we continue the playback as we eat"" Max suggested ""Also we might get a visitor. I mean previously destroyed building suddenly reappearing might get the attention of some people""

""Oh yeah like who?"" Lorelai asked

""The Princesses...hang on"" Sombra now got a good look at Twilight ""Huh...So he wasn't exaggerating. Anyways. The Princesses might get reports of this and investigate. Now then...shall we resume?""

""Fluttershy."" Twilight looked to shy Pegasus, who nodded and activated the orb picking up where they left off

# Spike the Jumper: Landing in Mistralton City, Debriefing, and a Test

When Spike and the group touched down in Unova, Sombra was there waiting for them. He looks at his watch ""Right on time"" Sombra said with a smile ""However there was a bit of a commotion in Sinnoh. But I handled it....By the way I have a Giratina as a result of that."" Sombra added quickly.

""A what?!"" Spike said with concern

""Not important. Team Plasma has been quite ever since I got here. But I have heard that they have been laying low."" Sombra ""However they have been some rumors here and there."" Sombra. then looked at Spike. ""Now we need to find Plasma...however I wish to see how good you are right now."" Sombra then frowned. ""There is one problem. I would tell you to take on the Gym of this City but...."" Sombra then had an expression that can be described as a combination of¬†[disgust and annoyance](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/06a81c86-741c-4a2b-bf67-bb57bc3f378b/d36cgcu-c44db1ed-ba87-40ea-befd-d08311ddffa3.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzA2YTgxYzg2LTc0MWMtNGEyYi1iZjY3LWJiNTdiYzNmMzc4YlwvZDM2Y2djdS1jNDRkYjFlZC1iYTg3LTQwZWEtYmVmZC1kMDgzMTFkZGZmYTMucG5nIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.q25C25y0RvC-ENw_-JjSWAZ8ygLMEwRjLTSoh70MDHo).

""What? You don't think I can do it?!"" Spike asked Indignantly

""No Skyla had been doing something rather dumb. Air Battles"" Sombra said. Which Elicits a groan from Flash and Sunset

""What's Wrong?"" Spike asked the couple.

""Skyla used to be a gym leader that would battle with flying type. Now she does this thing called Air Battles. An Air Battles is a battle that she played out in her head, instead of traditional battles. Skyla matched up her Pok√©mon against her opponent's and made decisions through their strengths and weaknesses. If she felt her team would have a disadvantage, she would give the challenger the Jet Badge. However, if she felt her team had the advantage, she would deny the challenger a Badge."" Spike looked at Flash with disbelief

""We wish we were kidding but we are being 100% serious."" Sunset then takes out her badge case showing her collection of Badges. Before pointing to a particular badge that looked like a feather ""I got this by showing her a bunch of electric type Pok√©mon and she just give me the badge"" Sombra nodded

""I did something similar but with rock types"" Sombra added

""Ditto"" Flash groaned. But Spike Smirked

""What if I can not only beat her by using Pok√©mon that would be a bad match up against Flying, But also get her to battle me normally"" Sombra raised his eyebrows

I have always enjoyed perfume but discovered indies this spring after experiencing cravings for some unusual scents, musty basement in particular (PSA: this can be a sign of low iron levels/anemia, as it was in my case!) **Alkemia** was the first house I started with after reading through the suggestions in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/12bw0rh/any_ideas_for_a_true_basement_smell/). I found some musty scents I really love (TLDR: **St. Louis Cemetery** and **Gaea** are my Alkemia holy grails) but I've also started to branch out and explore through sampling. I'm still developing my tastes, but so far I'm:

* most interested in atmospherics: musty, basementy, mildewy blends but also rain, petrichor, dirt, bricks, concrete/cement, asphalt, rocks, clay, sand, salt or other mineralistic notes, dust, laundry, pine, or papery notes.
* open to most florals and musks (laundryish musks are my fave) but haven't tried heavy or animalic versions of either. Also open to wood and green scents, coffee and tea notes, and herbal notes (some more than others, I like sage in general but not so much in perfume.)
* not too interested in aquatics other than rain but will try if the other notes are appealing. Same goes for super sweet gourmands; I am open to foodie notes like fruit, berries, citrus, chocolate, marshmallow, etc. in the right blend. I love non-gourmand vanilla and coconut.
* not interested at all in anise/licorice, lactonic notes, boozy notes, honey, or maple syrup.

I'm only interested in oils currently, and don't care at all about throw or sillage, Longevity is nice, but I don't mind reapplying throughout the day if I love the scent. On to the reviews, in alphabetical order!



**A Roll in the Hay** (*A delightful romp through dried hay, fresh green grass, early summer wildflower honey, vanilla grass, vanilla leaf, and wild poppy*) : Dry and sweet yellow hay and dry vanilla, strong and lasts FOREVER. This is nice for summer or late fall. It was a free sample and not necessarily something I would have chosen for myself, but I've grown to really love it.

**Awakening Desert** (*Rainstorm across desert. Cracked earth drinks deeply, softening into moist clay. Desert springs refill and replenish. An elemental scent of awakening... dry warm mitti earth, parched grasses, dried wood, and mineralistic clay drenched in rainwater*): I thought I would love this based on the notes, but I can't get over the banana note I'm smelling in the beginning, which I think is how I'm perceiving the dried grasses. Dry down is better but not really remarkable and doesn't last all that long.

**Book of Shadows** (*A biblichor of eldritch books - heavy parchment paper, ancient iron oak gall ink, crumbling leather bindings, and wafts of rare incenses*): This smells so good in the bottle, like glossy paper and ink. On skin it's STRONG ink and incense and lasts all day. Tried layering (a DROP) with a lighter, sweeter incense scent (Solstice Scents Scrying Smoke) which worked well.

**Coconut Alchemy** (*A summer tropical blend of fresh white coconut, sugarcane, baby bananas, tuberose, and gingerflower*): This is nice. The banana note is not too strong and fades quickly. Dries down to a coconut vanilla and doesn't last all that long. I had success layering it with woody scents like SS Gibbons or Badlands to give it some depth and longevity.

**Deus Ex Machina** (*An olfactory portrait of industrial decay and the fallen gods of age of disruption, innovation, and technological revolution... fire hardened steel, rusted iron, motor oil, wet cement, burnt copper wires, and grey amber*): This is so sexy. Now that it has aged I really get the motor oil while wet, and it dries down to a lovely wet cement and amber. May FS this one.

**Dustsceawung** (*The scent of forbidden explorations and an olfactory meditation on dust... attic air, the inside of old trunks, abandoned haylofts, library stacks, and abandoned buildings*): This is so good and dusty in the bottle but has a cloying or sour note on my skin. It's similar to Library by SS which is better.

**Gaea** (*Forest loam under warm spring sunshine, new ferns poking up through decaying leaves, maple sap flowing over lichens, mosses and wet stones at the edge of a vernal pool*): I LOVE this and immediately FSed. It's green in the bottle, like a thick sappy green of a hot, humid forest after the rain, but also has a cool and subterranean quality. Turns a bit powdery (the stone?) on skin, and stays just this side of mildewy. Not much staying power but layers well with longer lasting scents like Silver Sky.

**Lilacs Along the Winding Drive** (*Lilac bushes heavy and purple with blooms, a gentle breeze after light spring rain, a dusty pebbled driveway, a slightly rusty porch swing, and a small handful of late blooming violets)*: Very pretty; I only get lilacs from this but it's great layered with SS During the Rain to amp the rainy quality.

**Lost Highways** (*Roadtrip around the U.S. in a bottle. A botanical peregrination of Saw Palmetto Palm leaves and Southern cypress from the Southeast bayous; New mown hay, Lemon basil, Wild bergamot tea from the Great Plains; Linden blossom and Acadian pine from the Northeast; Night flowering desert flowers from the Southwest; and Spicebush and Incense cedar from the West and Northwest coast*): Pretty and complex. I can't pick out any individual notes although something in there is a bit sweet and cloying to me. I was excited about the pine but I don't get any unfortunately. It lasts subtly throughout the day and doesn't change too much on dry down.

**Love Among the Ruins** (*An ancient ruin of fallen stonework covered with lichen and tangles of flowering vines slowly disintegrating/returning to nature*): Opens with a sharp green note and develops a nice dusty stone note shortly after and lasts a while. I love the dry down but I'm not sure I like the opening enough to FS.

**Love Unforeseen** *(A romance of white musk, Persian chandelier lily accord, night blooming jasmine, laleh, honeysuckle, tonka bean, bergamot, white pepper, white amber, china clay, and the silvery aquatics of melting snow*): This has a lot going on but I like it. I get dry jasmine, then a sharp laundry musk, then something sweet and dusty almost like incense. I really get the clay in the dry down and it lasts a long time.

**Moss Maiden** (*The wild seduction of a full moon night. A luxuriant bed of moss, crushed wet ferns, earthy calamus roots, piquant cedar tips, galbanum, balsam pine, lichen, disturbed autumnal leaves, and aromatic incense woods*): I've been lucky enough to have a pretty high hit rate with Alkemia, and this was my first hard NO. It's green in the bottle but fresher and less thick than Gaea, but it turns crazy on my skin--hand-soapy, sharp, and really strong. There is a dry herbal note that's not bad but it's overwhelmed by SOAP.

**Novella** (*A cozy afternoon of curled up in a favorite chair - delicately spiced Lavender de Provence, steaming Earl Gray tea, and tattered old paperback books*): This is a strong tea scent with a little lavender for me; I don't get much paper but layering with SS Library amps the paper and smells AMAZING. Nice and cozy for cold weather.

**Prarie 66** (*The smell of an old cement-paved road in the desert just before dawn when the cement is cold and almost, but not quite damp. Flowering desert sage, aldehydes, grapefruit, Linden blossoms, bergamot, saffron, gray amber, yucca, yuzu, and cool concrete*): This does convey the effect of dawn on the road with an interesting cool dewy grittiness. I also get a touch of fizzy citrus and a fresh herbal or hay note. Layers well with St. Louis or SS During the Rain to amp the concrete note. Perfect for late summer.

**Sandscape** (*Sun warmed beach sand, Atlantic ocean breezes, the saline-aquatic scent of drying sea water on skin, and the faintest hints of tanning oil and seaweed*): Clean laundry musk with a beautiful sand note, it's so nostalgic especially with pool chlorine lingering on skin/hair. It's fairly long lasting and doesn't change much in dry down. I FSed as it was being discontinued, and I'm experimenting with layering including with Gulf Breeze by SS (adds brininess and amps the sand note) and Lazy River by Osmofolia (even though there's no chlorine per se, the pool adjacent notes work well).

**Silver Sky** (*A springtime freshet of rainwater musk, oceanic grey amber, muget, daffodil, silver needle tea, galbanum, and white cedar*): I sampled this based on a review on here that described it as "" laundry that has been through a cleaning cycle of green rain water and flowery detergent."" and it's true and it's great. It's fairly long lasting and doesn't change much in dry down. Nice layered with Gaea or SS During the Rain for a perfect rainy day vibe. May FS.

**Siren's Spell** (*A beachy love spell woven from the sun-warmed white beach sand, star jasmine, plumeria, suntan lotion, sea spray, coconut cream, vanilla orchid, and tonka*): This is heavily jasmine to me, and a more traditionally perfumey and less atmospheric take on the beach than Sandscape.

**St. Louis Cemetery #1** (*An atmospheric brooding of Spanish moss, crumbling stone, old cement, red clay brick, and graveyard dirt*): I'm OBSESSED with this and immediately FSed. It's dry, dusty bricks and cement, with a sweetness to it that's almost vanillic. To me it smells like what hitting bricks together sounds like if that makes any sense lol. Layering with Gaea for a wet/mildew dimension gives a pretty accurate basement smell, and I also found out by accident that it layers well with coffee notes (Sawmill by SS is a favorite rn). The only drawback is that it's very short-lived on my skin.

**Sun Dried Laundry in a Summer Rain** (*Stonewashed linen and clean, sun-dried cotton billowing gently on an old fashioned clothesline spattered by the first gently ozonic drops of a Maine summer rain*): This is vintage/discontinued and is a similar laundry musk and rain scent to Silver Sky. I blind bought it from the July sale and glad I did. Both this and Silver Sky are so amazing layered with Gaea or SS During the Rain.

**Tulips and Chimneys** (*An urban springtime of rainy aldehydes, wet asphalt, industrial steam engines, farmer's market bouquets of fresh tulips, Toulouse violets, mint pastels, and a warm touch of clove viburnum*): This actually smells like flowers, rain, and pollution, with a hint of petrichor. It's kind of funky and I kind of love it. Would consider FSing.

**Whisper of Stars** (*The ethereal magic of a summer night. Cool dew and airy musk whispering over green stemone, lily of the valley, jasmine tea, and Spanish tree moss*): This is a light flowery musk with a little bit of green that starts off strong and borderline soapy but quickly dries to a powdery, ambery scent that is fairly long lasting. It's very pillowy and comforting.

**Ydalir** (*Mysterious, smoky, and primal. A 100% natural origin scent of Megalithic ancestral memory - 35 million year old fossilized amber resin, oakmoss absolute, Siberian Black Pine, smoked Juniper tar, and balsam pine needles preserved in a base of pure, cold pressed Meadowfoam seed oil)*: This smells like BBQ sauce in the bottle! Reading through layering suggestions, I saw fruit mentioned so I layered a drop with Stolas by Fantome. I like the smoke it adds but there's something in there that borders on medicinal for me.

  
That's it (so far!) I feel like there are whole categories of scents in Alkemia's catalog that I haven't touched, so let me know if there's anything amazing I'm missing out on!",1,1734543933.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

1hh73zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1hh73zc/should_i_trust_this_board_or_a_therapist/,Should I trust this board or a therapist? ,"I (45M), am a long time lurker, first time poster.  I feel the need to post because of how many stories have resonated with me here in this forum.  I am frankly terrified of the implications of what I am reading about my own life.  I am asking for help from some of our older posters here with kids.  

I have been married to my wife (40F) for 10 years and have 2 kids, 8 and 10.   

Like so many other posters:

- I have a DB that is even more dead than the average it seems, maybe sex 10 times in the last 4 years
- like others I have been starved for affection and physical contact for years.  I have begged for more touch.  She does not compliment me, call me handsome (can‚Äôt remember last time), or really touch me in any way.  I have gotten jealous to see her simply touch friend we know in normal non sexual ways.  If she gives me a hug, it is usually preceded by ‚Äúlooks like you need a hug.‚Äù  I used to get pouty and sad and angry from the rejection, but since getting therapy I am much more reasonable about it.  ‚ÄúHoney, you make me feel like wanting touch and intimacy with your wife is a bad thing?‚Äù  I have talked to her rationally and without too much emotion, and the most I get back is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not demonstrative.‚Äù  The idea of asking her to give me a back massage because I‚Äôm sore would be out of the question.  She  wouldn‚Äôt be rude, she would just say no. I get jealous of my own kids for the affection she gives them. 
- like many others I am a giver/pleaser (and of course I‚Äôm a taker too) with plenty of my own attachment and mental health baggage, including OCD, which I am addressing.  I have provided very well, do more than my share of house stuff, and have spent more time with the kids than she has.  I am not perfect but I‚Äôm pretty sure I deserve some love and affection from someone.  My home is stable, my kids are thriving, I am trying to do everything right.  I have done some things that she has a right to be bitter about (nothing infidelity related), but the thing is, the lack of affection, sex, intimacy was happening long before that stuff.  I knew going into the relationship that she wanted nothing to do with being a housewife (more power to her), and I should not expect anyone to take care of me.  Well, I didn‚Äôt expect that for the rest of my life I would never come downstairs and be greeted with a hot cup or coffee, or have something I left on the floor picked up and put away even though she wasn‚Äôt the one who left it there.  She would claim housework is 50/50 and I don‚Äôt challenge, what the hell is point.  All I know is I‚Äôve been the one taking out the cat litter for the last 10 years.  She does lots and is a great mom, but it‚Äôs pretty clear that I will need to do the brunt of the work because she is a ‚ÄúTaurus‚Äù who likes to ‚Äúluxuriate.‚Äù  And I have been doing it for a long time in an endless quest to win her affection.

- like others I feel gaslighted, over a long period of time.  It is all so confusing.  I know I was part of the problem.  But why did I start to believe that it is kind of weird and weak to ask for affection?  I don‚Äôt know what to believe.  Was it my fault?  Could I have done something different not to be rejected?

- like others I absolutely adore my wife.  I love her so fucking much.  She isn‚Äôt a cold person, we will wonderful warm moments.  And I know she loves me.  But I fear she loves me as her ‚Äúbaby‚Äôs daddy‚Äù not as a husband and lover.  Im not interested being someone‚Äôs best friend. 

-like others there has been some suspicions behavior.  My radar started to off recently.  I pressed her if something is wrong, something I should know about.  We had a great night out with friends and came home and it was the perfect time be intimate, she rejected me of course.  But I had been I therapy and so I was very calm and talked to her about it.  In the past the issue was that she was a new mother, than it was that didn‚Äôt want the kids to come into the room, then it was my fault for falling asleep in the kids bed or because I go to bed to early (someone has to get up to make coffee lol).  I started sleeping with the kids just to be able to cuddle a little.  When I moved back to the bedroom I was reminded of how lonely I always was in that bed.  She never rolls over and gives me a kiss or anything.  And just to be clear, I absolutely do not demand a lot of sex or am a pain in the ass about it.   Anyways, on that night of rejection, the reason was that she just doesn‚Äôt have a sex drive, she has been stressed, and that‚Äôs just the way it is.  She agreed we could have sex but she would be a ‚Äúdead fish.‚Äù  This seemed like a pretty fucked up thing to say.  I asked her if she ever pleases herself, she said not really.  The next day I looked in her bedside table and found a hidden sex toy.   Of course I totally approve and encourage but it just got me wondering how much she hides from me.  

- I have been watching her behavior more closely.  I have noticed how subtly manipulative she can be.  I am so confused because I believe so strongly about what a good person she is, but now I don‚Äôt trust her, and the idea she has been keeping things from me or is consciously using me as someone to fill the husband duties, it would literally crush my view of humanity.  I have asked her every which way if anything is wrong, if she is committed to the relationship.  The most I will get is ‚Äúyes I‚Äôm committed to this relationship.‚Äù  

- like others this is coming to a head.  After about 40 sessions of IFS therapy, it all came out.  I thought it was the lack of love in my childhood that we were addressing, but it actually might be my wife.  I had never spoken a bad work about my wife to anyone until that day.  As I have said these words out loud they become more real and it is terrifying.  

- now to the therapist part:  my therapist, being a therapist, isn‚Äôt going to just validate my feeling that my wife may a manipulative taker.  Of course not because at the root of all of us are traumas that explain our behavior and what not.  The therapist says he has seen couples come back from this.  But I‚Äôm not sure I trust my wife anymore with my heart and that I would be paranoid that she will change her behavior for a while but will not last.  The therapist knows there are very good reasons my wife is doing what she is doing, that we some kind of approach avoidance thing going on.  But here‚Äôs the thing:  I might be fucked up, but if someone is dying of thirst, I give that person my cup.  Good reasons or not, I can‚Äôt see why someone could starve someone for love and then really change.  

- the most horrifying thing about this is my kids.  They are perfect and pure and wonderful.   I am verging on a mental health crisis starting to think they might have their hearts broken

Anyway so I‚Äôm barely awake, partaking in the complimentary coffee and listening to the local news. I turn around to top off my tiny styrofoam cup. 
Then this lanky guy started talking at me from across the room (~6 feet away ). I take a minute and then realize he‚Äôs talking about me, ‚Äúyou think you‚Äôre too good for this place, you‚Äôre a stuck up pos‚Äù etc.. 
Basically he‚Äôs just making insane assumptions for someone who I‚Äôve been in the lobby with for literally 5 minutes and haven‚Äôt said a word to.

I give him my best /you‚Äôre fucking insane/ facial expression and respond ‚ÄúAre You??‚Äù
Then I left because wtf, I didn‚Äôt sign up to be verbally harassed while getting coffee.

The couch was an ominous shade of mustard yellow, the coffee table wobbled dangerously every time someone so much as breathed near it, and the walls were lined with shelves stuffed full of DVDs, action figures, and ancient VHS tapes no one dared to touch.

  


The media of choice that evening was ‚ÄúStellar Vanguard X: Galaxy of Shadows‚Äù, an obscure 1980s sci-fi epic so low-budget that the special effects made the original Doctor Who episodes look like cutting-edge CGI. It was a glorious disaster‚Äîa mixture of clunky space battles, melodramatic acting, and costumes that looked like they‚Äôd been crafted from tin foil and dollar store Christmas decorations.

  


Maximillian sat cross-legged on the floor, leaning toward the screen as though he were deciphering an ancient text. His notebook was already filled with scrawled diagrams, timelines, and an incomprehensible chart that might‚Äôve been a family tree or a schematic for faster-than-light travel.

  


‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt make any sense,‚Äù he declared, jabbing his pen toward the screen as the protagonist, Captain Zorath, delivered a stilted monologue about the dangers of the Nebula Matrix. ‚ÄúThe entire concept of a Nebula Matrix is nonsensical. A nebula is just a cloud of gas and dust! You can‚Äôt store data in it unless‚Äîwait‚Äîare they implying it‚Äôs some kind of quantum-entangled dark matter field? Because if so, they‚Äôre completely ignoring the fact that‚Äî‚Äù

  


‚ÄúMax,‚Äù Zara interrupted from her position sprawled across the armchair, ‚Äúno one cares. It‚Äôs not like this movie has an actual science consultant on staff. They probably filmed half of it in someone‚Äôs garage.‚Äù

  


Ellis, meanwhile, was on the couch, clutching a pillow and staring at the screen with a dreamy expression. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I think Commander Lysara makes it work. Look at her! She‚Äôs got that whole ‚Äòwarrior princess in space‚Äô vibe. That silver jumpsuit? Iconic. The way her hair stays perfectly feathered even during zero-gravity combat? Unbelievable. She‚Äôs perfection.‚Äù

  


Zara threw a piece of popcorn at him. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a cardboard cutout with a laser sword. You‚Äôre acting like she‚Äôs Shakespearean.‚Äù

  


Ellis caught the popcorn and popped it into his mouth. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called charisma, Zara. Something you clearly wouldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúCharisma?‚Äù Zara snorted. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs delivered every line like she‚Äôs ordering fast food. ‚ÄòI‚Äôll have the double nebula cheeseburger with extra photon fries.‚Äô‚Äù

  


‚ÄúHey! That‚Äôs character development!‚Äù Ellis shot back. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs stoic. Hardened by the galactic war. She doesn‚Äôt have time for frills.‚Äù

  


Max, barely acknowledging their bickering, scribbled furiously in his notebook. ‚ÄúThis script is a goldmine of inconsistencies,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúFor example, in Act One, they explicitly state that the Starblade‚Äîtheir main ship, mind you‚Äîcan only sustain warp for five minutes at a time. But here we are, twenty minutes into Act Three, and it‚Äôs been in warp for at least thirty minutes! Did they just forget their own rules? Or are we supposed to assume they upgraded it off-screen? Because if that‚Äôs the case‚Äî‚Äù

  


‚ÄúMax!‚Äù Zara groaned, flopping dramatically back into her chair. ‚ÄúNot everything has to follow a rules-based system! Sometimes it‚Äôs just dumb space fun.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not an excuse,‚Äù Max retorted, looking genuinely offended. ‚ÄúEven dumb space fun needs internal logic. Otherwise, it collapses under the weight of its own stupidity.‚Äù

  


On the screen, Commander Lysara executed a flawless roundhouse kick to an alien‚Äôs face, sending it flying across the room. Ellis let out a delighted gasp. ‚ÄúDid you see that? Poetry in motion. A perfect arc! A goddess among mere mortals.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúThat alien was clearly a rubber puppet,‚Äù Zara said, throwing another piece of popcorn at him. ‚ÄúYou could see the guy‚Äôs hand moving it.‚Äù

  


Ellis ignored her, clutching his pillow like a lovesick teenager. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a puppet. Lysara could beat up the entire Muppets cast, and I‚Äôd still simp for her.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say ‚Äòsimp,‚Äô‚Äù Zara deadpanned. ‚ÄúIt makes me want to call the authorities.‚Äù

  


Max, still laser-focused on his notes, suddenly perked up. ‚ÄúWait a second,‚Äù he said, flipping back a few pages. ‚ÄúThe alien they just fought looks exactly like the one from Scene Fourteen. They just reused the same costume. Look, it has the same scratch on the left eye! Did they think no one would notice?‚Äù

  


Ellis leaned toward the screen. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not laziness; that‚Äôs recycling. Very eco-conscious of them.‚Äù

  


Zara rolled her eyes so hard she nearly saw the back of her skull. ‚ÄúThis whole thing is held together with duct tape and vibes. Why are we even watching this?‚Äù

  


‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs a classic,‚Äù Max replied indignantly. ‚ÄúIt paved the way for modern sci-fi. Without Stellar Vanguard X, we wouldn‚Äôt have Star Wraith Chronicles or Galactic Siege: Horizons.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúAnd Commander Lysara,‚Äù Ellis added, sighing dreamily. ‚ÄúQueen of the cosmos. My muse.‚Äù

  


Zara threw her hands up in defeat. ‚ÄúI give up. You‚Äôre both insane.‚Äù

  


The movie reached its climax‚Äîa chaotic space battle that was equal parts unintelligible and spectacular. Sparks flew from control panels. Lasers zigzagged wildly across the screen, missing their targets by light-years. Commander Lysara delivered a triumphant one-liner, punctuated by an awkwardly long pause as the camera zoomed dramatically into her face.

  


‚ÄúThat,‚Äù Ellis whispered, ‚Äúwas the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúThat,‚Äù Zara said, ‚Äúwas the cinematic equivalent of a dumpster fire.‚Äù

  


‚ÄúThat,‚Äù Max declared, furiously jotting down notes, ‚Äúwas objectively the worst way to resolve their central conflict. They just deus ex machina‚Äôd their way out of a no-win scenario! The Nebula Matrix somehow absorbs the enemy fleet? That‚Äôs not how nebulas work!‚Äù

  


The credits began to roll, and the room fell into a brief silence as they all absorbed the chaos they‚Äôd just witnessed.

  


Finally, Zara stood up, stretching. ‚ÄúWell, that was two hours of my life I‚Äôll never get back. Who‚Äôs picking the next movie?‚Äù

  


Ellis grinned. ‚ÄúMe. And it‚Äôs going to have more Lysara. I think she‚Äôs in the sequel.‚Äù

  


Max sighed, closing his notebook. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs a sequel, I need to analyze how they managed to get funding after this catastrophe.‚Äù

Prior to these symptoms, I was not staying hydrated at all. Drinking alcohol most night, including liquor the night before, coffee, energy drinks and really anything other than water.

1hh6qca,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/1hh6qca/do_not_work_at_cafe_du_monde/,Do not work at cafe du monde ,"
I‚Äôve always loved Caf√© du Monde. Who doesn‚Äôt? The vibe is electric, the beignets are legendary, and the staff somehow manages to keep up with the insanity of nonstop customers day in and day out. On the surface, it‚Äôs this warm, iconic spot that feels like New Orleans magic personified.

But behind the scenes? It‚Äôs a soul-crushing nightmare.

Working at Caf√© du Monde is like stepping into a circle of hell Dante forgot to write about. Breaks? Forget it. The constant stream of tourists, locals, and random coffee addicts means you‚Äôre on your feet for hours on end with no real moment to yourself. You might get a second to breathe, but you‚Äôll immediately get slammed with demands again. The unrelenting pace doesn‚Äôt stop, and neither does the expectation that you‚Äôll handle it all with a smile plastered on your face.

And the owners? Oh, don‚Äôt even get me started. They don‚Äôt care about their employees. At all. No incentives, no holiday bonuses, no perks, nothing. You‚Äôd think a place that rakes in money hand over fist, especially during the holidays, would at least throw a bone to the people making it all possible. Nope. You‚Äôre treated like a cog in a machine that‚Äôs never allowed to stop running.

Sure, some days during the holidays, the money can be good. But that‚Äôs if you survive the day without completely burning out or breaking down from the sheer chaos. And honestly, it‚Äôs not worth it when the baseline for this place is absolute misery. They could at least pretend to care about their employees, but they don‚Äôt even try.

That said, there are two shining lights in the madness: Seth and Brandon, the managers. These guys are the real deal. Unlike the owners, they actually care about the workers and go out of their way to cater to everyone‚Äôs needs. They‚Äôve always been amazing, doing everything they can to make the hellscape just a little more bearable. Without them, the place would completely fall apart.

So yeah, the service is amazing, but it‚Äôs because the employees are breaking themselves to make it happen. If you ever go, enjoy your beignets, tip generously (because the staff deserves every penny), but remember that the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù comes at a huge cost to the people behind the counter.

Working at Caf√© du Monde isn‚Äôt just bad‚Äîit‚Äôs a complete and total sh*tshow, and it‚Äôs high time we start holding places like this accountable for how they treat their workers.

1hh6opz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1hh6opz/dont_leave_anything_for_later/,Don‚Äôt Leave Anything For Later ,"Seize the Moment

In the whirlwind of modern life, it‚Äôs all too easy to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, postponing our dreams, desires, and daily tasks for a nebulous ‚Äúlater.‚Äù Far too often, we tell ourselves that there will be ample time to pursue our passions, mend relationships, or simply indulge in those special moments that make life worthwhile. But what if, instead of waiting for later, we embrace the present?

The Coffee Gets Cold
Picture the morning ritual of brewing a fresh cup of coffee. In our hustle, we may leave it sitting on the countertop, intending to enjoy it once we finish checking emails or tackling that never-ending to-do list. Before we know it, that warm cup of coffee has turned lukewarm, losing its magic. Life, much like that forgotten cup of coffee, requires us to savor the moment. The richness of experiences is best enjoyed when we take the time to relish them instead of letting them pass us by.

Interest Fades
Our interests and passions can be fleeting, particularly when we allow distractions to control our focus. A dream unpursued often leads to a slow but sure erosion of motivation. Whether it‚Äôs setting aside time to learn a new skill or finally beginning that creative project you‚Äôve put off for months, the longer we delay, the more difficult it becomes to reignite that passion. Rather than telling ourselves we‚Äôll do it tomorrow, we should act now. The excitement of engaging in something we love is often best felt in the moment, rather than framed as a future goal.

Day Turns to Night
The days are fleeting. The sun rises, the clock ticks, and before we know it, night begins to fall. Each day presents a myriad of opportunities: the chance to connect with friends, try a new activity, or simply spend time in reflection. However, if we continuously defer our plans to a later time, those day-to-day opportunities slip through our fingers like sand. When we commit to living in the present, we can fill our days with meaning, memories, and joy, rather than allowing them to fade into a repetitive cycle of ‚Äútomorrow.‚Äù

Growing Up and Growing Old
With every passing year, we find ourselves growing older‚Äîboth in age and in experience. Yet, with that growth, many of us also harbor regrets for moments we didn‚Äôt seize. We often look back and think, ‚ÄúIf only I had acted on that desire when I had the chance.‚Äù Children have a remarkable ability to live fully and engage in the present, finding wonder in simple things. As we age, let us learn from that innocence and actively choose to live without fear of failure or judgment. Embracing a mindset of immediacy not only enriches our lives but also connects us more deeply to those around us.

The Regret of Inaction
Perhaps the most poignant of all reflections is the idea of regret. It‚Äôs a weighty sentiment that stings more than failure‚Äîwhen we pass up opportunities and look back in sorrow. Regret doesn‚Äôt just stem from the things we did that didn‚Äôt turn out the way we hoped, but from those we chose not to pursue at all. Whether it‚Äôs a love we didn‚Äôt profess, a trip that was never taken, or a career shift we feared embracing, these unattempted actions linger in our hearts and minds.

Conclusion: Embrace the Now
Living in the present requires effort, mindfulness, and a conscious choice to act. The old adage, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt put off until tomorrow what you can do today,‚Äù rings strikingly true. Each moment is a gift, one that we should unwrap and experience fully without succumbing to procrastination. Whether it‚Äôs making that call to an old friend, taking up a new hobby, or simply enjoying the warmth of a freshly brewed cup of coffee, seize the opportunities life presents.

Tomorrow is a promise for no one; so why not embrace today? To live boldly, to love deeply, to act now‚Äîthis is where life unfolds its most beautiful moments. Let‚Äôs commit to not leaving anything for later, for later may never come.

It doesn't affect my ability to form images in my head, but it's very noticable for me and I was wondering if there's any sort of chemical or scientific basis to it? I also get a really racing heart and sometimes nausea, I never really get an energy rush from coffee.

Side note, I tend to get a bit more impulsive on caffeine, but I think that's mostly because I usually overthink what I want to say and do beforehand and I'm more likely to act on ideas if I can't think them through further.

Height: 6‚Äô 0‚Äù  
Weight: 235 lb.  
Medical conditions:  Asthma, ADHD, MDD, SUD  
Medications: Wellbutrin 300 XL (q.d.)




I was in prescribed Wellbutrin in January of 2023. I was on 150 XL. Seemed to be doing good. Depression was still hitting me, not as bad as before, so I made the jump to 300s a couple of months ago, just to see. I‚Äôve noticed very minor chest pains the last month or so. I don‚Äôt know if I didn‚Äôt notice it before, or what. It happens roughly on the left side towards my lower pec muscle. 

The thing is, I don‚Äôt know what to attribute it to. Perhaps it is because of my recreational use of cocaine, however‚Äî I‚Äôve used coke about once a month even before I started Wellbutrin. Even when I do use coke, it‚Äôs a very small amount‚Äî like $20-$30 worth which isn‚Äôt even half a gram. I also understand that I‚Äôm rationalizing the use of cocaine, but I also genuinely don‚Äôt feel like this is an out of control or terribly dangerous usage.

I also thought that perhaps it‚Äôs because I still consume a lot of caffeine. I would say I average 300mg a day, some days less and some days more. I also had the idea that it could even be a lung issue and not a heart issue since I am a daily weed smoker, and also hit vapes here and there.  

Today, I decided to take one of my leftover 150XL pills and drank just one cup of coffee, and I haven‚Äôt felt any pains at all.  

So, any ideas? Is it the caffeine, the coke, the weed, or the Wellbutrin?

I‚Äôm seeing a preventive cardiologist in a month to discuss this.  But, my question is this:  what tests are out there to see the soft/inflammatory plaques  I already have.  Also what labs I should be asking for like LDL particle size, LP(a), ApoB, homocysteine, etc.

Full post:

I‚Äôm a 36M with a previous LDL of 300.  I likely have a strong genetic component as well with both maternal grandparents and mother dying of heart disease.

I will admit, before that test, I ate A LOT of sat fats in my diet.  Cheese and egg, lots of heavy cream in my morning coffee, whole milk, very little focus on fiber because I mainly avoided most primary carb sources.  I wasn‚Äôt keto by a long shot, though I dabbled with that diet a few times.

Since that test, I‚Äôve switched to high fiber based meals, and reducing many of the sat fat sources I once consumed.  I‚Äôm statin intolerant and no, the symptoms didn‚Äôt  ‚Äújust go away‚Äù with time.  I become more and more convinced with time and research that LDL alone is a poor indicator of ASCVD.  

I‚Äôve heard LDL lowering for reducing ASCVD risk likened to preventing accidents by taking half the cars off the road.  Will the risk be lower, yes, but it falls well short of getting to the root of the problem of who the crazy drivers are.  

I also realize that this is currently the only practical way we have to lower ASCVD risk.  Which is why I‚Äôm trying to lower it as naturally as possible and using myself as a guinea pig to test my hypotheses amongst various dietary contexts.  I‚Äôm not just a ‚Äútake the drug and shut up‚Äù kind of person.  I need to know how and why.

I‚Äôm open to trying other drugs after a retest if the side effects aren‚Äôt too bad.  But what id also like to do is get an idea of what damage has already been done.  I know CAC scoring isn‚Äôt all that helpful because it only measures stable calcified plaque and the problem is primarily with the soft/inflammatory plaques.

So I 20F met this guy we‚Äôll call him Adam 21M back in my freshman year of high school and he was a sophomore. I was getting my volunteer hours filming for the school football team and he was a player. We exchanged numbers, texted, late night phone calls, etc; I really thought things were going good and we were getting along exceptionally well. To my surprise a couple weeks in he had ended things for reasons at this point I do not remember. I started speaking to someone else who ended up being my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship however real it can be when you‚Äôre 14-15 yrs old. When Adam found out he decided to apologize and tell me he was sorry wanted a relationship with me etc. I had declined and we went quite awhile not speaking and avoiding each other in the halls. this lasted about a year and half when we connected again. Once again started chatting and had made plans to meet up, we ended up hooking up and it went radio silent on his end. Life moved on and about another year later we started speaking again made plans and hooked up and once again I was ghosted. I started making a joke of it to my friends that this was my annual hookup. He ended up getting into a pretty serious long-term relationship so I hadn‚Äôt heard from him in awhile but once they had ended their relationship he reached out to me again and we started talking and I‚Äôm sure from the pattern of where this is going you know what happened next, this one was different, we stayed the night, he made me coffee in the morning kept me around a little bit later into the afternoon and I had finally thought we were going somewhere and that this time he really liked me like this time and where my dumbass thought he was going to sweep me off my feet and ride into the sunset but once again I was ghosted. We hadn‚Äôt spoken for probably 5-6 months when he reached out to me again late this past August and we started chatting, I made a promise to myself I wouldn‚Äôt be so readily available and being in college I was pretty busy and had other things to occupy my time and mind but the chatting had went well and progressed. He asked me out for lunch by my school and we went out had good conversation and I finally felt like I was taking control of the narrative, until‚Ä¶ you guessed it, radio silence. I had decided to take a respectful approach this time and just messaged him thanking him for lunch and how lovely it was catching up and I hope everything was alright. He had reached back out about day later explaining to me he was basically hung up on his ex (a different girl) and how she was practically harassing him at his place of work bringing in the guy she had cheated on him with. I tried to be reassuring and encouraging telling him this girl was clearly trying to get a reaction out of him and for him to ignore it but had put the timeline together and since that lovely morning we had together to him reaching out again, he had gotten himself a new girlfriend. The on and off texting continued for about another 2 months, until I found it pointless and had stopped answering entirely. He had sent me random things like memes on instagram that I had responded to, but once again I stopped all together. Around Monday night he sent me a DM asking ‚Äúwhy are we playing cat and mouse‚Äù, I had responded ‚Äúonly one person is playing and has been for years‚Äù.  I will attach that convo below for readers to indulge themselves. Please the read texts to get his response to wanting to be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.

The thing is, I don‚Äôt know what to attribute it to. Perhaps it is because of my recreational use of cocaine, however‚Äî I‚Äôve used coke about once a month even before I started Wellbutrin. Even when I do use coke, it‚Äôs a very small amount‚Äî like $20-$30 worth which isn‚Äôt even half a gram.  

I also thought that perhaps it‚Äôs because I still consume a lot of caffeine. I would say I average 300mg a day. I also had the idea that it could even be a lung issue and not a heart issue since I am a daily weed smoker, and also hit vapes here and there.  

Today, I decided to take one of my leftover 150XL pills and drank just one cup of coffee, and I haven‚Äôt felt any pains at all.  

So, any ideas? Is it the caffeine, the coke, the weed, or the Wellbutrin? ",0,1734541429.0,Wellbutrin_Bupropion,1,0.5,False

Jess sat shotgun, feet up on the dashboard, scrolling through her phone and occasionally smacking me on the arm to show me memes I couldn‚Äôt look at.¬†

Behind us were Kyle, Luke, and Rachel, crammed together in the back seat. Kyle was holding a Styrofoam cup filled with God-knows-what, leaning forward between the seats. He was the type of guy who always looked like he was about to tell you something you wouldn‚Äôt want to hear but would laugh at anyway. Luke, on the other hand, was quieter. Big into hiking and survival stuff, he‚Äôd been our ‚Äúnature guy‚Äù ever since Jess declared we needed one. Rachel was the calm one, always keeping us grounded when things got chaotic‚Äîwhich they always did with Jess and Kyle around.

Honestly, the drive wasn‚Äôt bad. The weather was perfect‚Äîblue skies, a slight breeze‚Äîand the road twisted and turned through some of the prettiest landscapes I‚Äôd ever seen. We passed a few scattered houses, but eventually, those gave way to dense forests. By the time we reached the gravel road leading to the camp, it felt like we‚Äôd stepped out of reality and into some beautifully forgotten corner of the world.

When we finally saw the camp sign‚Äîwooden and faded, with the words ""Blackpine Camp"" barely visible‚Äîwe cheered. I pulled the car into the gravel lot, killed the engine, and stepped out. The air smelled like pine and earth, cool and clean, and for a moment, everything felt perfect.

The car doors slammed shut one after another, the echoes swallowed by the surrounding forest. Jess stretched dramatically, her flannel shirt riding up slightly as she groaned, ‚ÄúGod, I think my legs forgot how to work.‚Äù

‚ÄúCry me a river,‚Äù Kyle said, tossing his cup into a nearby trash bin. ‚ÄúTry sitting in the middle seat for three hours. I‚Äôm ninety percent elbows right now.‚Äù

Rachel pulled out a laminated camp map. ‚ÄúOkay, according to this, the main cabin is just up that path. That‚Äôs where we‚Äôll find the supply closet and, hopefully, coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúCoffee‚Äôs priority one, huh?‚Äù Luke asked, adjusting his backpack straps.

‚ÄúObviously. You don‚Äôt want me uncaffeinated, trust me,‚Äù Rachel replied with a soft smirk.

Blackpine Camp looked like something out of a postcard‚Äîat least at first glance. The cabins were rustic but sturdy, sitting in a semi-circle around a gravel clearing with a fire pit in the middle. Beyond that, there were trees as far as the eye could see, their branches swaying gently in the breeze.

Kyle was the first to break the silence. ‚ÄúOkay, where‚Äôs the creepy guy with the hook for a hand? He‚Äôs late.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, Kyle,‚Äù Jess said, rolling her eyes. She walked toward the largest cabin, the one that looked like it might‚Äôve been an old mess hall. ‚ÄúThis place does have some serious summer camp horror movie vibes, though. I‚Äôm into it.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly the energy we need‚ÄîJess summoning Jason Voorhees on day one.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying,‚Äù Jess shot back, pushing the door open and peeking inside. ‚ÄúIf I hear one creepy noise tonight, I‚Äôm leaving you all behind.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoted,‚Äù I said, following her in. The inside smelled like wood and dust, with beams of sunlight cutting through the cracks in the old shutters. There were rows of long, wooden tables, most of them covered in cobwebs.

Kyle wandered in behind us, kicking at one of the benches. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm digging this.‚Äù

‚ÄúLess digging, more cleaning,‚Äù Rachel said, stepping into the room with a bucket and a mop she‚Äôd found in one of the supply sheds. ‚ÄúThe sooner we get this place livable, the sooner we can relax.‚Äù

We spent the next couple of hours splitting up and tackling different parts of the camp. Luke cleared debris from the fire pit while Rachel started scrubbing down the mess hall. Kyle and Jess worked on organizing the sleeping cabins, which were just as dusty as the mess hall but surprisingly intact. That left me in charge of unloading the food and gear.

As I lugged a cooler toward the mess hall, I spotted Jess standing in the doorway of one of the cabins, her arms crossed. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she called out. ‚ÄúCome look at this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked, setting the cooler down and walking over.

She gestured inside the cabin. ‚ÄúTell me this isn‚Äôt weird.‚Äù

I stepped in and saw what she meant immediately. Hanging from the ceiling was a small bundle of sticks and feathers, tied together with an old piece of string. It looked handmade.

‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù I said, reaching up to touch it.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch it!‚Äù Jess said, slapping my hand away.

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs creepy as hell, and I don‚Äôt want you activating some ancient curse or something while I'm standing here.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just a decoration,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYeah, sure,‚Äù she said, narrowing her eyes. ‚ÄúWhen I'm gone you can deal with it. I‚Äôm not sleeping in here if that thing‚Äôs still hanging.‚Äù

Before I could respond, Kyle stuck his head in the door. ‚ÄúHey, lovebirds, quit slacking. Luke says the fire pit‚Äôs ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not slacking,‚Äù Jess snapped, shoving past him. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not a lovebird.‚Äù

Kyle grinned. ‚ÄúWhatever you say.‚Äù

We regrouped by the fire pit just as the sun started to dip below the trees. Luke had set up a circle of old camp chairs, and Rachel had brought out a bag of marshmallows she‚Äôd found in our gear.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù Kyle said, holding up a marshmallow on a stick. ‚ÄúThis is the life. No cell service, no responsibilities, just us and nature.‚Äù

The fire was dying down when the first weird noise reached us. At first, I thought it was just the wind playing tricks‚Äîlow and faint. None of us said anything about it, too caught up in the moment. Kyle had been telling some ridiculous story about a haunted amusement park, waving his arms around like the overenthusiastic camp counselor he was born to be.

‚Äú‚Ä¶and then the clown‚Äôs head just‚Äî‚Äù he clapped his hands together, ‚Äú‚Äîpops right off! Blood everywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúNice,‚Äù Jess said, throwing a marshmallow at him. ‚ÄúWay to kill the vibe.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, that was gold,‚Äù Kyle replied, catching the marshmallow mid-air. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just mad you don‚Äôt have my storytelling skills.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm mad that you exist,‚Äù Jess shot back, laughing.

‚ÄúGuys, shh,‚Äù Rachel interrupted, holding up a hand. ‚ÄúDo you hear that?‚Äù

We all froze. For a moment, there was only the crackling of the fire and the occasional chirp of crickets. Then I heard it‚Äîa faint, rhythmic mumbling, almost like someone talking to themselves. It was coming from the direction of the woodline, just beyond the clearing.

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù Luke asked, leaning forward.

‚ÄúWind?‚Äù I said, though I wasn‚Äôt sure.

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù Jess muttered, standing up. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a voice. Someone‚Äôs out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, like a serial killer or something,‚Äù Kyle joked, though his nervous chuckle gave him away.

Rachel shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, seriously, we need to check this out. What if it‚Äôs someone who needs help?‚Äù

‚ÄúOr someone who‚Äôs gonna murder us,‚Äù Kyle added.

Jess rolled her eyes and grabbed one of the flashlights. ‚ÄúShut up, we‚Äôll never know unless we look. Don‚Äôt be a baby, Kyle.‚Äù

Reluctantly, we all grabbed whatever makeshift ‚Äúweapons‚Äù we could find‚Äîfirewood, long sticks‚Äîand followed Jess toward the sound. It grew louder as we neared the edge of the clearing, the mumbling taking on an unsettling rhythm. It was almost hypnotic, rising and falling in a set of odd jitters and cooing.

We swept our flashlights around once the noise felt like it was in our ears. That‚Äôs when we saw her.

She was crawling through the dirt, hunched over like some wounded animal. The beam of Luke‚Äôs flashlight caught her pale, wrinkled skin, and we froze. She was completely naked, her body thin and frail, the bones of her shoulders and hips jutting out like they were trying to escape her skin. Her hair was gray and stringy, hanging in uneven clumps around her face.

‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù Jess whispered. ‚ÄúIs she‚Ä¶ okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoes she *look* okay?‚Äù Kyle hissed.

Rachel took a cautious step forward. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam? Are you alright?‚Äù

The woman didn‚Äôt react. She kept crawling, her hands digging into the dirt as she mumbled to herself. Her voice was low and guttural, the words slurring together in a way that didn‚Äôt sound like any language I‚Äôd ever heard.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam?‚Äù Rachel tried again, louder this time. ‚ÄúDo you need help?‚Äù

Still nothing.

Luke swung the flashlight to her face, but she didn‚Äôt even flinch. Her eyes were wide and glassy, staring blankly ahead as if we weren‚Äôt even there.

‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs deaf,‚Äù Jess whispered, her voice tight.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs naked,‚Äù Kyle said, his voice rising slightly. ‚ÄúWhy the hell is she naked?‚Äù

‚ÄúStop,‚Äù Rachel said sharply. She stepped closer, holding her hands out like she was approaching a scared animal. ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôre not going to hurt you. Can you tell us what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

The woman suddenly stopped crawling, freezing in place. For a moment, the only sound was the wind rustling through the trees. Then, she slowly turned her head toward Rachel.

‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù Jess breathed.

The woman‚Äôs face was pale and sunken, her cheekbones sharp under her paper-thin skin. Her mouth hung open slightly, and for a brief, horrible moment, I thought she might smile. But she didn‚Äôt. She just stared, her glassy eyes unfocused and empty.

Rachel took a step back. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ okay. Maybe we should‚Äî‚Äù

Before she could finish, the woman turned away and began crawling again, dragging herself into the treeline.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, wait!‚Äù Rachel called after her, but the woman didn‚Äôt stop. Her mumbling resumed, louder now, her bony hands clawing at the ground as she disappeared into the darkness.

‚ÄúWhat the *fuck* was that?‚Äù Kyle said, his voice shaking.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Luke said, lowering the flashlight. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think we should follow her.‚Äù

‚ÄúFollow her?‚Äù Jess snapped. ‚ÄúWho the hell said anything about following her?‚Äù

Rachel looked like she was about to argue, but then she glanced back at the woods and seemed to think better of it. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just leave her out there‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gone,‚Äù I said firmly. ‚ÄúAnd whatever‚Äôs going on with her‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not something we can deal with. Let‚Äôs just go back to the cabin and figure this out in the morning.‚Äù

No one argued. We hurried back to the fire pit, leaving the woods behind, but the air felt heavier after that, like the trees were forming a wall around us. By the time we reached the cabin, no one was talking.

Inside, we locked the door and sat in silence for a while, listening for any sign of the woman. But the woods outside were silent.

Morning came too quickly, dragging with it the kind of exhaustion that no amount of coffee or sunlight could shake. None of us said much at breakfast. The memory of the woman‚Äîthe way she crawled, the way she looked right through us‚Äîhung over the table.

Kyle poked at his cold eggs with a plastic fork. ‚ÄúSo, uh, is no one gonna talk about the naked grandma in the woods, or are we just pretending last night didn‚Äôt happen?‚Äù

Jess shot him a glare. ‚ÄúI think we all saw it, Kyle. You don‚Äôt have to be an ass about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt normal. People don‚Äôt just‚Ä¶ do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe could‚Äôve been sick,‚Äù Rachel offered, ‚ÄúMaybe she wandered off from somewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom where?‚Äù Luke asked, leaning back in his chair. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the middle of nowhere. Closest house is what, twenty miles?‚Äù

‚ÄúGuys, can we not?‚Äù I said, rubbing my temples. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just get through today. Maybe she was some random drifter, and she‚Äôs long gone by now.‚Äù

Jess snorted. ‚ÄúYeah, sure. Long gone. Totally normal behavior to crawl around naked and mumble in the dirt before just taking off.‚Äù

The rest of that day we split up to tackle more of the cleanup, but the air around camp felt different‚Äîthicker, somehow. It wasn‚Äôt just the woman; it was everything. The woods, the cabins, even the sky. It was like a strange type of stillness.¬†

By mid-morning, I was clearing brush from the trail near the cabins when I found it: a small bundle of sticks, feathers, and animal bones tied together with frayed red string. It was hanging from a low branch, swaying gently in the breeze.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is this?‚Äù I muttered, staring up at it.

‚ÄúFound one too?‚Äù Luke‚Äôs voice startled me, and I turned to see him walking up the trail towards me.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre everywhere,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve counted five so far. Jess found one tied to the side of a cabin, and Rachel‚Äôs freaking out.‚Äù

I reached up to take the one hanging in front of me, but Luke grabbed my wrist.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù he said, his voice low. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt touch it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs creepy as hell, that‚Äôs why. You don‚Äôt mess with stuff like this.‚Äù

Jess appeared behind him, holding up a bundle in her hand. ‚ÄúSo what do we do? Just leave them here? Hope the arts-and-crafts witches don‚Äôt come back for round two?‚Äù She extended out her arm to look at the twigs. ‚ÄúI was on your page before, Luke, but these things got to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need to tell someone,‚Äù Rachel said, jogging up the trail to join us. She was pale, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. ‚ÄúThese things weren‚Äôt here yesterday and I already took down a few with Kyle. Someone‚Äôs been here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, no shit,‚Äù Jess said. ‚ÄúProbably the same someone who was crawling around last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop,‚Äù I said, my voice sharper than I meant it to be. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. But freaking out isn‚Äôt going to help.‚Äù

Rachel opened her mouth to argue, but before she could say anything, Kyle called out from the direction of the cabins. ‚ÄúUh, guys? You might wanna see this.‚Äù

We followed his voice to the fire pit, where he was crouched over something on the ground. As we got closer, I saw what he was looking at: a strange symbol etched into the dirt. It was a perfect circle with jagged lines radiating out from the center, almost like a sunburst.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fresh,‚Äù Kyle said, tracing the edge of the symbol with his finger. ‚ÄúI checked the fire pit last night before bed. This wasn‚Äôt here.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, great,‚Äù Jess said, throwing her hands up. ‚ÄúSo now we‚Äôve got creepy symbols, freaky art projects, and a naked lady crawling around in the woods. Are we sure this isn‚Äôt some elaborate prank? Like, are there hidden cameras somewhere?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs a prank, it‚Äôs a damn good one,‚Äù Luke muttered.

Rachel shook her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is a joke. I think‚Ä¶ I think we‚Äôre being warned.‚Äù

‚ÄúWarned about what?‚Äù Kyle asked, standing up.

Rachel didn‚Äôt answer. She just looked back at the woods, her face pale and drawn.

The rest of the day passed in uneasy silence. None of us wanted to stray too far from the cabins, but staying close didn‚Äôt feel much better. Every noise, every shadow in the trees, set my nerves on edge.

By the time the sun began to dip below the horizon, we were all on edge. The strange symbols, the bundles, the oppressive silence of the woods‚Äîit was all adding up to something.

I caught Jess glancing over her shoulder as we walked back to the cabin for dinner.

‚ÄúDo you think she‚Äôs still out there?‚Äù she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I didn‚Äôt need to. We both knew the truth.

When we finished dinner‚Äîif you could call microwaved instant noodles a dinner‚Äîthe tension in the cabin was thick enough to choke on. Nobody wanted to admit they were scared, but the way Jess kept glancing at the windows and how Kyle wouldn‚Äôt put down the fire poker spoke volumes.

We tried to distract ourselves with a card game, but it didn‚Äôt help much. Every shuffle of the deck sounded unnaturally loud.

‚ÄúThree of a kind,‚Äù Jess said, slapping her cards on the table. ‚ÄúPay up, losers.‚Äù

Kyle groaned and flicked a peanut at her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre cheating. I know it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to cheat to beat you, Kyle,‚Äù Jess said, smirking, though her eyes darted toward the window again.

Rachel stood abruptly, wringing her hands. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù Luke asked.

‚ÄúPretend everything‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs not fine. There‚Äôs something *wrong* here. The symbols, the bundles, the woman‚Äîthis whole place feels‚Ä¶ off.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Kyle said, tossing his cards on the table. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs all panic. That‚Äôll totally fix everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not wrong, though,‚Äù Jess said, her voice softer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just her. You all feel it, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Nobody answered, but the silence was enough.

And then, something changed.

It started faint, just like the night before: low, rhythmic mumbling, drifting through the trees. My stomach twisted as the sound grew louder, closer. It wasn‚Äôt the same as last night‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt one voice this time. It was many.

‚ÄúTell me that‚Äôs the wind,‚Äù Jess said, her voice trembling.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the wind,‚Äù Luke muttered, already reaching for the flashlight.

We crowded by the window, staring out into the dark. The fire pit was barely visible in the faint moonlight, but beyond it, a figure moved.

At first, it was hard to make out‚Äîshadows shifting just outside the clearing. But as the mumbling grew louder, the shadows stepped into the open.

They were old women. At least, they looked like old women. They moved slowly, shuffling in uneven steps, their heads low and their shoulders hunched. The firelight caught their faces‚Äîwrinkled, pale, and blank, like the woman from the night before. There were four of them, all muttering under their breath in that same strange, guttural language.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Kyle whispered, backing away from the window.

‚ÄúAre they‚Ä¶?‚Äù Rachel started, but her voice broke.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre old,‚Äù Jess said, gripping the edge of the table.¬†

The women didn‚Äôt seem to notice us. They shuffled around the fire pit, their muttering rising and falling like some bizarre chant. One of them stopped and tilted her head back, her mouth opening wide as if she was screaming, but no sound came out.

‚ÄúWe should go out there,‚Äù Rachel said suddenly.

‚ÄúAre you insane?‚Äù Jess snapped. ‚ÄúDid you not see what happened last night? We don‚Äôt go near them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just women,‚Äù Rachel said, though her voice was shaking. ‚ÄúWhat if they‚Äôre lost? What if they‚Äôre‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not lost,‚Äù Luke said firmly. ‚ÄúLook at them. Does that seem lost to you?‚Äù

We all turned back to the window. The women had started to move again, this time heading toward the woods. One of them paused at the edge of the trees and turned, staring directly at the cabin.

I felt my breath catch. Her eyes were blank and milky, her expression slack. But somehow, I felt her looking *through* the cabin, like she could see us, see *me*.

‚ÄúClose the curtains,‚Äù I whispered.

Jess moved quickly, yanking the curtains shut and plunging the cabin into darkness. We all stood there for a moment, listening to the sound of our own breathing and the muffled murmurs of the women outside.

After what felt like an eternity, the mumbling began to fade.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre leaving,‚Äù Luke said, his voice barely audible.

Nobody moved until the forest fell silent again. Even then, we stayed huddled together in the center of the room, too afraid to speak.

Eventually, Kyle broke the silence. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre all just gonna pretend that was normal, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, Kyle,‚Äù Jess said, but her voice wavered.

None of us slept that night. Every creak of the cabin, every gust of wind, sounded like footsteps. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, trying to convince myself it was over. But deep down, I knew the women would be back.

None of us spoke much the next morning either. We sat around the cabin‚Äôs small dining table, sipping instant coffee and avoiding each other‚Äôs eyes. The daylight felt weaker than it should‚Äôve, like the sun was trying to push through some hidden barrier. I kept glancing at the window, half-expecting to see one of those women standing in the clearing.

‚ÄúWe have to leave,‚Äù Rachel said suddenly, breaking the silence. Her voice was hoarse, her face pale. ‚ÄúToday. Right now.‚Äù

Jess nodded, barely touching her coffee. ‚ÄúYeah. This place is messed up. I don‚Äôt care if the camp leader gets mad‚Äîwe‚Äôre leaving.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine by me,‚Äù Kyle muttered. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs pack up and get the hell out of here.‚Äù

Luke set his mug down and rubbed his temples. ‚ÄúOkay, but what‚Äôs the plan? The car can only take so much gear. Do we‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure it out,‚Äù Rachel interrupted. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll leave the camping supplies or whatever. We just have to‚Äî‚Äù

A loud, metallic clang echoed through the cabin, cutting her off. Everyone froze.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù Jess whispered.

‚ÄúSounded like it came from the car,‚Äù Luke said, standing quickly.

We all grabbed whatever we could find‚Äîflashlights, a crowbar, a broom‚Äîand headed outside. The clearing was empty, but the sound had definitely come from the direction of the parking area.

When we reached the car, my stomach dropped. Both tires on the driver‚Äôs side were slashed, deflated into sad, crumpled shapes against the gravel. A long, jagged tear ran down each one, as though something sharp and deliberate had ripped through them.

‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù Jess muttered.

‚ÄúNot just that,‚Äù Luke said, crouching near the hood. He pointed to a pool of dark liquid spreading under the car. ‚ÄúThey cut the fuel line, too.‚Äù

Kyle kicked at a rock, cursing under his breath. ‚ÄúAre you kidding me? Who the hell does this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe *women*,‚Äù Rachel said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúIt was them. It has to be.‚Äù

Jess threw up her hands. ‚ÄúOkay, great. So now we‚Äôre stranded in fucked town. What do we do now?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe wait,‚Äù Luke said firmly, standing up. ‚ÄúThe camp leader‚Äôs supposed to show up tomorrow morning, right? That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ what, 24 hours? We can survive one more night.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne more night?‚Äù Rachel‚Äôs voice cracked. ‚ÄúDid you see what they were doing out there? What if they come back? What if they don‚Äôt leave this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a choice,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not walking twenty miles through the woods with no cell service. We stay, and we stick together.‚Äù

Jess looked like she wanted to argue, but she didn‚Äôt. Instead, she folded her arms and stared at the ground. ‚ÄúFine. But I‚Äôm not just standing here like a sitting duck. We‚Äôre boarding this place up.‚Äù

We spent the rest of the day trying to stay busy. Luke and Kyle boarded up the windows in the cabins while Jess and I gathered firewood. Rachel sat by the radio, twisting the knobs in vain, trying to pick up a signal.

‚ÄúWe should‚Äôve left yesterday,‚Äù she said when I came back inside.

I didn‚Äôt argue. She was right.

As the afternoon wore on, the unease grew worse. None of us wanted to stray too far from the cabin, but being inside felt claustrophobic. The woods seemed darker than they should‚Äôve been.

At one point, Jess found another bundle laying near the fire pit‚Äîthis one bigger than the others, with what looked like a tuft of animal fur tied to it. We didn‚Äôt touch that one.

By the time the sun started to set, we were all back in the main cabin, our nerves frayed and our tempers short.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Luke said, ‚ÄúIf they show up again, we stick to the plan. Stay together, stay inside, and don‚Äôt open the door.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if they break in?‚Äù Kyle asked, his voice unsteady.

‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt,‚Äù Luke said, though he didn‚Äôt sound convinced. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

Nobody believed him.

The sky outside darkened. I could feel it in my bones: the night was coming.

It started with the wind. The shutters rattled, and the trees outside groaned like they were on the verge of snapping. Luke had locked and barred the doors earlier in the evening, and we‚Äôd shoved the cabin‚Äôs two flimsy tables against them for good measure. But none of it felt like enough.

Rachel was still by the radio, twisting the knobs in a desperate, silent plea for a signal. Jess was in the corner, gripping a kitchen knife she‚Äôd dug out of the supply shed, her lips pressed into a thin, furious line. Kyle sat on the floor, gripping the fire poker so tightly his knuckles had gone white.

‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù Jess finally asked, breaking the silence.

‚ÄúLate,‚Äù Luke said. He was crouched by the window, keeping an eye on the clearing through a crack in the boarded shutters.

Jess laughed bitterly. ‚ÄúGreat. Super helpful. Thanks, Luke.‚Äù

‚ÄúCut it out,‚Äù I said, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúWe need to stay calm.‚Äù

‚ÄúCalm?‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúDid you miss the part where we‚Äôre trapped in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of psycho witches who slashed our tires and cut our fuel line? You want me to *calm down*?‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to stop freaking everyone out!‚Äù

Before Jess could respond, Luke held up a hand. ‚ÄúQuiet.‚Äù

We all froze, every muscle in my body locking up as I strained to hear what he did. At first, there was nothing but the wind and the groaning trees. And then I heard it‚Äîthe sound I‚Äôd been dreading since the sun set.

The chanting.

It started faint, like it had the night before, but this time, it wasn‚Äôt coming from the woods. It was closer. Much closer.

‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù Rachel whispered.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here,‚Äù Luke said, his voice flat.

We crowded around the window, peeking out through the cracks. The fire pit at the center of the clearing glowed faintly with embers we thought had died hours ago. Figures moved in the shadows around it, their bodies lithe and jerky, like crows being yanked on leash.

They were the same women from the previous night‚Äîor whatever was left of them.

Their skin hung loose and torn, the raw, pink flesh underneath glistening in the firelight. Their faces were pale and hollow, their eyes milky and empty, but their mouths moved in a synchronized rhythm, muttering words that didn‚Äôt belong to any language I‚Äôd ever heard.

One of them bent backward at an impossible angle, her head lolling unnaturally to one side as her voice grew louder. Another dragged something heavy behind her‚Äîa burlap sack that squirmed and bled onto the dirt.

‚ÄúAre those‚Ä¶‚Äù Kyle started, but his voice trailed off, his face ashen.

The women moved with purpose, dragging the sack toward the fire pit. One reached into it and pulled out a struggling, writhing animal‚Äîa rabbit, I think. The woman held it high above her head, her muttering rising to a fever pitch, and then‚Äî

She ripped it open with her bare hands.

Rachel let out a choked sob and stumbled back from the window, but I couldn‚Äôt look away. Blood poured down the woman‚Äôs arms, thick and dark, pooling at her feet. She flung the carcass into the fire, where it hissed and popped, filling the air with the sickening stench of burning flesh.

The chanting grew louder, more aggressive. The other women followed suit, pulling more animals from the sack‚Äîmangled rabbits, a squirrel, something I couldn‚Äôt even identify‚Äîand spilling their blood into the flames.

‚ÄúStop watching,‚Äù Jess hissed, grabbing my arm and yanking me back from the window. ‚ÄúWe need to do something!‚Äù

‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù Kyle said, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are we supposed to do against *that*?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt just sit here!‚Äù Jess snapped.

‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt come for us yet,‚Äù Luke said quietly, his eyes still glued to the window. ‚ÄúWe stay inside. We stay quiet. Maybe they‚Äôll‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, but we all knew how that sentence was supposed to end. Maybe they‚Äôll leave.

The fire in the clearing roared higher, throwing long, flickering shadows across the trees. One of the women began to scream‚Äînot in pain, but in what sounded like triumph. Her voice was guttural, inhuman, rising above the others as she threw her arms wide and tipped her head back to the sky.

The others joined in, their bodies contorting in ways that shouldn‚Äôt have been possible. Bones cracked, joints twisted, and yet they didn‚Äôt stop moving.

I pressed my hands over my ears, trying to block out the sound, but it was inside me, vibrating in my skull, in my chest, in the marrow of my bones.

And then, one of them stopped.

She turned slowly, her head snapping unnaturally to one side, and stared directly at the cabin.

‚ÄúThey know we‚Äôre here,‚Äù Rachel whispered, her voice trembling.

The woman stepped forward, her movements erratic and uneven. Another followed her, and then another. They moved toward us, their eyes gleaming white in the firelight, their mouths still muttering.

‚ÄúGet away from the window,‚Äù Luke ordered, but I was already backing up.

The chanting grew louder, more frenzied, until it was deafening. I could feel it in my teeth, in my ribs. My vision blurred, and for a second, I thought I might pass out.

And then, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped.

The silence was worse than the noise.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not coming inside,‚Äù Jess said, her voice trembling but defiant. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not‚Äî‚Äù

A sharp, heavy thud against the door cut her off.

We all froze, staring at the door, which buckled slightly under the impact. Another thud followed, and then another, each one louder and more violent.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to break in,‚Äù Rachel whimpered.

Luke grabbed the crowbar from the floor and stepped in front of the door. ‚ÄúStay back,‚Äù he said, his voice hard but shaking.

The thudding stopped.

And then, from the other side of the door, came a low, rasping voice:

‚ÄúLet us in.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt a question. It was a demand.

I wanted to scream, to run, to do anything but stand there, but my feet were rooted to the floor.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move,‚Äù Luke whispered. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say anything.‚Äù

The voice came again, louder this time, and closer.

‚ÄúLet us in.‚Äù

The firelight outside flickered, and I could see their shadows through the cracks in the shutters. They were everywhere, surrounding the cabin, waiting.

The pounding on the door stopped.

For a moment, the only sounds were our shaky breaths and the faint crackle of the fire outside. My heart was hammering so hard I thought it might burst. Jess was clutching the kitchen knife like it was the only thing keeping her alive. Kyle held the fire poker, standing frozen near the window.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gone,‚Äù Rachel whispered, though her voice shook with disbelief. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre‚Ä¶ gone.‚Äù

Luke didn‚Äôt move from the door. ‚ÄúNo. They‚Äôre not.‚Äù

As if in answer, the window behind us shattered. Glass exploded inward, and Jess screamed as something long and clawed reached through, swiping at the air. The hand‚Äîor whatever it was‚Äîwas pale and thin, its skin sagging off the bones like wet paper.

‚ÄúGet back!‚Äù Luke yelled, swinging the crowbar and slamming it against the frame. The creature retracted its arm with a guttural hiss.

‚ÄúBlock it! Block the window!‚Äù Kyle shouted, grabbing a chair and slamming it against the broken pane.

Before we could catch our breath, another window shattered. Then another. The sound was deafening, each break followed by the relentless muttering and scratching of those things clawing at the cabin‚Äôs defenses.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre everywhere!‚Äù Jess screamed, backing toward the corner of the room.

‚ÄúBasement!‚Äù Luke shouted, pointing toward the trapdoor near the kitchen. ‚ÄúWe can barricade ourselves down there!‚Äù

We scrambled for the trapdoor, Rachel practically dragging me as my legs felt like lead. Jess was already there, yanking it open and shoving the others through.

‚ÄúHurry!‚Äù she yelled.

Kyle went next, followed by Rachel. Luke shoved me toward the opening. ‚ÄúGo!‚Äù

I climbed down the creaking ladder into the damp, dark basement. The air smelled like mildew and old dirt. Rachel fumbled with her flashlight, casting jagged beams of light across the low, claustrophobic space.

Luke followed, slamming the trapdoor shut above him just as another crash rang out from the cabin. Something heavy landed on the floor above us, followed by the sharp scrape of claws against wood.

We all huddled in the corner, our backs pressed against the cold stone wall. The room was deathly silent except for the sound of our breathing.

For a moment, I thought maybe we were safe.

Then we heard the trapdoor creak.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Jess whispered, gripping the knife so tightly her hand was shaking. ‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Ä¶‚Äù

The door groaned, the wood splintering as something heavy pressed against it. The muttering was louder now, filling the room like a dozen bell chimes.

And then the trapdoor shattered.

The first one dropped into the basement with a sickening crunch. Her legs bent the wrong way when she landed, but she didn‚Äôt seem to notice. Her skin hung off her frame in wet, rotting folds, and her milky eyes glowed faintly in the dark.

Jess lunged forward, slashing with the knife, but the hag moved unnaturally fast, twisting around her strike and slamming her to the ground. Jess screamed as claws raked across her chest, tearing through her shirt and skin like paper.

‚ÄúGet off her!‚Äù Kyle roared, charging forward with the fire poker. He swung hard, cracking the hag across the face, but it barely phased her. She turned on him, her jaw unhinging to reveal jagged, yellowed teeth.

More of them dropped into the basement, their movements jerky and inhuman. The room filled with chaos‚Äîscreams, growls, the wet sound of flesh tearing.

‚ÄúRun!‚Äù Luke shouted, grabbing my arm and pulling me toward the far corner of the basement, where a narrow crawlspace led into the foundations.

I stumbled, nearly tripping over something soft and warm. I didn‚Äôt want to look, but my eyes betrayed me. Jess lay on the floor, blood pooling beneath her as one of the hags dragged her limp body toward the trapdoor.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I shouted, reaching for her, but Luke yanked me back.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gone!‚Äù he yelled. ‚ÄúWe have to go!‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt process it. Couldn‚Äôt believe it. Jess, the loudest, most assertive of us, was gone.

Rachel was next. As we crawled through the tight, damp tunnel, she let out a choked gasp. ‚ÄúNo! Get off me!‚Äù

I turned in time to see one of the hags clawing at her ankle, dragging her backward. Her screams were cut short as another hag appeared behind her, grabbing her hair and yanking her into the darkness.

‚ÄúRachel!‚Äù I screamed, but Luke shoved me forward.

‚ÄúKeep moving!‚Äù he hissed.

The crawlspace opened into a wider section of the foundation, the walls damp and crumbling. Kyle was there, clutching his arm, which hung at an unnatural angle. His face was pale, his eyes wide with shock.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre everywhere,‚Äù he mumbled. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt‚Äîthere‚Äôs too many of them.‚Äù

Luke crouched beside him, shaking him by the shoulders. ‚ÄúStay with me! We‚Äôre going to make it!‚Äù

Before Kyle could respond, a shrill, unnatural scream echoed through the foundation. The light from Rachel‚Äôs discarded flashlight flickered, and I saw them.

The hags poured into the space, their twisted bodies moving unnaturally fast, their claws raking the walls as they closed in.

Kyle let out a ragged yell and lunged forward, swinging the fire poker with his good arm. He hit one of the creatures, but another slammed into him from the side, sending him sprawling.

I didn‚Äôt see what happened next. I didn‚Äôt want to.

Luke grabbed my hand and pulled me into a narrow crack in the foundation. We pressed ourselves into the tight space, the cold stone digging into my back.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move,‚Äù Luke whispered, his voice barely audible over the sound of claws scraping stone and the wet, gurgling screams of our friends.

The hags moved through the space, sniffing the air, their muttering filling the cracks in my skull. One of them stopped inches from our hiding spot, its head jerking toward us.

I held my breath, praying it couldn‚Äôt see us.

It tilted its head, its hollow eyes scanning the darkness. For one horrible moment, I thought it would reach for us. But then it turned and disappeared into the shadows.

The screams stopped.

Luke and I stayed in that crack for what felt like hours, too afraid to move, too afraid to breathe. The muttering faded, replaced by the distant whisper of wind through wood.

When we finally crawled out, the basement was empty. The walls were splattered with blood, and the air reeked of copper and decay.

Jess. Kyle. Rachel. They were gone.

The basement was silent, the kind of silent that makes your ears ring. My legs were cramping from how long Luke and I had been wedged into the crack in the foundation, but I didn‚Äôt dare move. Neither of us did.

I stared at the floor in front of me, trying not to focus on the blood spattered across the stone or the claw marks gouged into the walls. My mind was fractured, cycling through images of Jess‚Äôs limp body, Rachel‚Äôs screams, and the wet, sickening sounds of what they did to Kyle.

I didn‚Äôt realize I was crying until Luke touched my arm. His face was pale, streaked with dirt and sweat, and his eyes were hollow. He didn‚Äôt speak‚Äîhe just pointed to the faint sliver of light filtering in from the broken trapdoor above.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gone,‚Äù he mouthed, his voice too weak to form actual words.

I shook my head. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that,‚Äù I whispered, though my voice cracked.

‚ÄúI do,‚Äù he insisted, his voice barely audible. ‚ÄúListen.‚Äù

I forced myself to listen. The hags‚Äô guttural muttering, the scraping of their claws, the screaming‚Äîthey were gone. Luke reached out slowly, testing the air. When nothing happened, he motioned for me to follow.

It took everything I had to crawl out of the crack. My body felt heavy, my arms and legs trembling as if they weren‚Äôt mine. The basement felt smaller than it had before, every corner soaked in death. Luke and I climbed the broken remains of the ladder and pushed the trapdoor open cautiously.

The cabin was destroyed. Furniture was overturned, the walls gouged and broken, and the floorboards were slick with blood. I tried not to look too closely at the stains‚Äîat what was left of our friends.

‚ÄúKeep moving,‚Äù Luke muttered, his voice hoarse. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop.‚Äù

We stepped into the clearing. The fire pit was still smoldering, the embers casting long, flickering shadows across the camp. The bundles of sticks and feathers were scattered across the ground, soaked in what I hoped was water but knew wasn‚Äôt.

There was no sign of the hags.

When the first light of dawn broke through the trees, I almost cried. The pale yellow glow didn‚Äôt feel real, like it was some cruel hallucination meant to lure us deeper into the nightmare. But the further we walked, the brighter it became.

And then we heard the rumbling of a truck.

It was parked just off the dirt road, a beat-up old thing with the camp‚Äôs logo painted on the side. The camp leader‚Äôs truck.

Luke broke into a run, shouting and waving his arms, but I hung back, my legs refusing to move. I watched as the door opened and a man stepped out, his face wrinkled and weathered but undeniably human.

‚ÄúJesus Christ, what happened to you kids?‚Äù the camp leader asked, his voice thick with concern.

Luke fell to his knees, gasping for breath. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre dead,‚Äù he said, his voice cracking. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all dead.‚Äù

The man‚Äôs face fell. He rushed over to me, his hands on my shoulders as he asked me what happened. I couldn‚Äôt answer.

Luke told him everything, his words tumbling out in a frantic, jumbled mess. The camp leader‚Äôs face grew darker with every sentence, his eyes darting toward the woods as if he expected the hags to come bursting out at any moment.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù

He drove us into town, where the police and paramedics were waiting. I don‚Äôt remember much after that. Just flashes‚Äîbeing wrapped in a blanket, answering questions I didn‚Äôt have answers to, the way they looked at us like we were crazy.

They searched the camp. They didn‚Äôt find anything.

No bodies. No blood. Not even a single claw mark.

The police said it was a trauma response, that we‚Äôd imagined things in the chaos of the night. But I know what I saw. What I heard.

They‚Äôre still out there.",10,1734541394.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1hh645p,https://www.reddit.com/r/OccupationalTherapyPH/comments/1hh645p/otrp_nakooo/,OTRP NAKOOO,"I just wanna share how happy I am that I‚Äôm finally a licensed Occupational Therapist. I started my OT journey in 2019, and I only applied to 1 OT school in Cebu (yes bisaya ko!) and it was fun and nice until the pandemic came. I did, as any of us would, try my best to study and pass but failed in AnaKines (Anatomy and Kinesiology) in which I had to retake my 2nd year. Being an irregular student, I started to work online and earned, and from time to time, I worked up until third year (since my work sched is very flexible, it suited my schedule) so I could save up and buy an iPad kay I know it would be very useful. 

Third year was the most difficult year for me, especially neuro conditions and I was very sure na I was gonna fail that sem again because no matter how hard I tried (I study until dawn, get less than 5 hours of sleep everyday even on weekends), my grades were still very low‚Äî but God is so good, nakapasa ako! Internship came, then thesis defense, then graduation came and I was very happy na I was able to finish my degree in my dream school! üíö

During my 5 month review season, there were times wherein I‚Äôd feel overwhelmed, and at some point I had so many backlogs but I took a rest, went out to go on hikes, and regained my focus to continue with my review. It was around late September to early October when I was able to adjust to the review szn sched. Although I definitely wasn‚Äôt able to follow the rigid schedule I set for myself, and despite some days of feeling unmotivated to study and read my book reviewers, I‚Äôd try to force myself to read one lesson so I can say na even if ginagmay lang (pakonti) I was able to accomplish something.

I failed during the first mockboards, with what I estimated my grade would be at least 60% and that motivated me to do better! 2 weeks before the board exam, nag lock-in na ko, everyday I was in the coffee shop, and from time to time, I would pray and ask God to guide me and allow me to become an extension of his love, mercy, and healing by making me a licensed OT! And when I say that prayers work, they really do because during the 2-day board exam, there were so many items I was unfamiliar with esp. MedSurg, and during those struggling times, I‚Äôd hold my holy rosary, ask Mama Mary and God to guide me and enlighten me.

The waiting game was very difficult because although I won‚Äôt be studying anymore, I still couldn‚Äôt sleep in anticipation of the results. I was constantly refreshing my iPad‚Ä¶ and at 4pm on December 17, when the results came out, I went out of my room and shouted that I passed the board exam!!!

All I can say is, despite the hurdles and challenges, I am very lucky because I have support all around me: my parents, esp. my Mom for always reminding me to take care of my self and sleep esp when I study beyond 3 a.m. during college; my friends M, N, C for being my college constants and for helping me! I am very very lucky to have you guys üíï. To my CIs and lecturers from my College üíö. To my review center for being able to comprehensively teach us in preparation for the board exams (thanks Gold Rank!!! The best kayo!). And most especially, to Mama Mary and to God. Simula nu‚Äông first year pa ako hanggang nakapagtapos ako, may ikinabit akong Miraculous Medal sa ID sling ko, at sa bawat exam, oral revalida, case conferences, etc., I always call Mama Mary and seek her divine intercession üíôü§ç salamat Mama Mary for always being with me

I‚Äôm wondering around how much caffeine has a standard coffee capsule from the Starbucks brand (for Nespresso, especially intensity between 5 to 8). It indicates 100% arabica coffee on the package (Europe) but not the dose of caffeine for a capsule.

Because I drink easily 5-6 coffees a day but apparently it is better if we do not exceed 500-600 mg a day.

Things went wrong at my husband's job we move here for several years ago and he's now finishing out his contract through May remote. As soon as breaking our lease won't kill us financially, we're moving and he'll go back to working in an office around people. I work remote in a totally different field, but I'm very introverted and love it. I think its going to be much harder for him bc he's super extroverted and I'm worried he's going to drive me crazy wanting interaction. Covid was really hard on him with the lockdowns and being stuck inside. He has friends he meet up with a couple of times a week,, but got a lot of his interaction at work before this.

Do you have any ideas for things I can do to help him?  I was thinking stuff like working from coffee shops or those coworking places, but that's all I could think of.

Now I have a few questions.

1. Hosted cloud server: I am not sure which server I chose (or even if I was offered the options) when I created the account. Is there a way to check?
2. Email address as username: What are the benefits of using a ""plus"" address (e.g., myname+randomstring@domain.com) versus myname@domain.com? Will an alias email address (without myname before @ but will be forwarded to my primary address) work as well? If using a ""plus"" email address as suggested (or an alias email address) is definitely better but I used simply the primary email address for account creation and I already have some items in the vault (but haven't exported any backup yet), what is the best way to change over?
3. Master password: Instead of a 4(or 5) word passphrase, how about something like a sentence (e.g., ""He has twelve cups of coffee every day!"")?
4. KDF algorithm: Can I now change to Argon2id without issues? I mainly use Mac and iPhone.

Elliot Parker was the kind of man you wouldn't glance at twice in a crowded room. His life was the definition of routine‚Äîa metronome ticking through the same dull beat day after day. Every morning, at precisely 6:47 a.m., his alarm would beep, an old digital clock that seemed to mock him with its insistence on punctuality. He‚Äôd swing his legs out of bed, pull on his beige slippers, and shuffle to the bathroom, brushing his teeth with military precision.

He worked at Midtown Paper Supplies, a job as bland as its name, processing invoices and staring at spreadsheets that drained the color out of his soul. His coworkers were no better‚Äîoffice small talk revolved around weather, sports, and a mutual disdain for Mondays. Elliot often wondered if his life was a cosmic joke, the punchline being that there was no punchline at all.

Evenings weren‚Äôt much better. He‚Äôd microwave a frozen dinner, sit in his squeaky recliner, and watch reruns of sitcoms he‚Äôd seen a hundred times. He‚Äôd laugh at the canned laughter, more out of habit than humor, and feel the weight of the silence that followed. Life was... fine. Not good, not bad, just fine.

Until it wasn‚Äôt.

The day it all changed started like any other. The alarm beeped, the beige slippers shuffled, and Elliot found himself staring into his coffee mug, the swirling cream hypnotizing him in its lazy dance. He didn‚Äôt notice the faint hum growing louder, didn‚Äôt see the flicker of the overhead lights.

And then, a freak accident‚Äîa bolt of lightning tore through the cloudless sky, slamming into his apartment building. Elliot didn‚Äôt even have time to register the deafening crack before his world went black.

When he opened his eyes, he wasn‚Äôt in his apartment anymore. Nor was he in a hospital. He was lying on a cold, obsidian floor under a blood-red sky. The air smelled of sulfur and despair. Around him, jagged cliffs jutted out like broken teeth, and rivers of molten lava snaked through the landscape.

A voice boomed above him, dripping with malice and confusion.

‚ÄúElliot Parker?‚Äù it drawled, as though tasting the syllables. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be here.‚Äù

Elliot sat up, heart pounding. ‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶ where am I?‚Äù

The voice laughed‚Äîa deep, guttural sound that sent shivers down his spine. ‚ÄúWhy, Hell, of course. And you, my unfortunate friend, are about to have the worst day of your life.‚Äù

Elliot blinked, his mind struggling to process. Hell? No, this wasn‚Äôt right. He‚Äôd lived a boring, law-abiding life. He paid his taxes on time, never jaywalked, and even helped old ladies cross the street. This had to be a mistake.

And yet, as the ground trembled and shadows with glowing red eyes began to close in, the terrifying reality of his situation began to sink in.

Mistake or not, he was here. And Elliot Parker‚Äôs dull, uneventful life had just taken a very unexpected turn.

Elliot scrambled to his feet, his legs wobbling like jelly. The jagged, obsidian ground beneath him radiated heat, forcing him to hop awkwardly from one foot to another. The shadows around him moved closer, their eyes glowing with malice, their forms twisting like smoke and flame. He tried to speak, to ask the voice‚Äîwhoever it belonged to‚Äîwhat was happening, but his mouth felt like it was stuffed with cotton.

‚ÄúWait! This‚Ä¶ this has to be a mistake!‚Äù he stammered, his voice cracking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to be here! I‚ÄîI never did anything bad! I‚Äôm a good person! A *boring* person!‚Äù

Another booming laugh echoed through the sulfur-thick air, so loud it felt like it could split the ground in two. ‚ÄúMistake? Oh, my dear, unfortunate mortal, there are no mistakes in Hell.‚Äù

The voice paused, then added, almost thoughtfully, ‚ÄúWell, except for this one. Hmm. Interesting‚Ä¶‚Äù

Elliot swallowed hard. His heart was racing, and his palms were slick with sweat. The shadows circled him like sharks, whispering things in languages he couldn‚Äôt understand. He felt a chill, despite the heat.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòmistake‚Äô?‚Äù he asked, forcing his voice to steady. ‚ÄúYou just said there are no mistakes!‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù the voice replied. ‚ÄúBut there is always a first for everything. You‚Äôre a‚Ä¶ clerical error.‚Äù

The words hit Elliot like a punch to the gut. A clerical error? His eternal damnation was the result of some cosmic paperwork mishap? He felt a surge of frustration bubbling beneath the fear. Of all the absurdities in his dull existence, this one took the cake.

‚ÄúClerical error?‚Äù he repeated, incredulous. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm in Hell because someone upstairs misplaced my file?‚Äù

‚ÄúPrecisely,‚Äù the voice said, its tone oozing amusement. ‚ÄúIt appears your soul was destined for Heaven‚Äîdull though it may be‚Äîbut a little mix-up in the system dropped you here instead. And now‚Ä¶ well, now you‚Äôre our problem.‚Äù

Elliot‚Äôs mouth fell open. The shadows stopped circling and began hissing softly, as though disappointed. One of them reached out a tendril-like appendage, and Elliot yelped, stumbling backward.

‚ÄúWait! Can‚Äôt you‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ fix it?‚Äù he pleaded, waving his arms wildly. ‚ÄúSend me back to where I belong? I didn‚Äôt sign up for this!‚Äù

The voice chuckled again. ‚ÄúAh, if only it were that simple. Souls don‚Äôt get refunds. Once you‚Äôve crossed the threshold, you‚Äôre ours.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not my fault!‚Äù Elliot protested, his voice rising. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt *do* anything to deserve this!‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù the voice conceded. ‚ÄúAnd yet, here you are.‚Äù

Before Elliot could respond, the ground beneath him began to shift. He stumbled, looking down in horror as the obsidian floor cracked open, revealing a gaping chasm. The shadows laughed, their voices blending into a cacophony of mockery and malice.

‚ÄúWelcome to Hell, Elliot Parker,‚Äù the voice intoned, its tone now devoid of humor. ‚ÄúYou might want to start running.‚Äù

And with that, the shadows lunged.

Elliot didn‚Äôt need to be told twice. His legs moved before his brain could catch up, propelling him across the jagged terrain. Each step sent pain shooting through his feet, but adrenaline drowned out the worst of it. Behind him, the shadows howled and shrieked, their tendrils whipping at the air like a storm of pure malice.

He ran blindly, the landscape a blur of red skies, black rock, and rivers of lava. The air grew thicker with every breath, burning his lungs, but he couldn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt dare stop.

Somewhere deep inside, a small, incredulous voice screamed, *This is impossible. This can‚Äôt be happening. You‚Äôre just a guy. A boring guy. You don‚Äôt even know how to run properly!*

He tripped.

The ground came up fast, and Elliot slammed into it, scraping his hands and knees. He rolled over, panting, and looked up just in time to see the shadows closing in. They loomed over him like a living storm, their glowing eyes piercing through the dim light.

‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù he gasped, raising his hands in desperation. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt belong here! I don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

The shadows stopped. Not all at once, but in a strange, rippling motion, as though some invisible force had yanked their leashes. They hissed and writhed, their forms flickering like static on an old TV screen.

A new sound filled the air: a slow, deliberate clap.

‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù a voice drawled. ‚ÄúWhat do we have here?‚Äù

Elliot twisted his neck toward the sound, his heart hammering in his chest. A figure emerged from the shadows, tall and lean, with sharp features that seemed to have been chiseled from stone. He wore a tailored black suit that looked wildly out of place in the hellish landscape, and his eyes burned with a mischievous glow.

‚ÄúElliot Parker,‚Äù the man said, his lips curling into a smirk. ‚ÄúThe mortal who fell through the cracks. You‚Äôve caused quite the stir, you know.‚Äù

Elliot blinked, too stunned to speak. The man‚Äîor whatever he was‚Äîstrode closer, his polished shoes clicking against the obsidian floor as though he were walking through an art gallery rather than Hell.

‚ÄúLet me introduce myself,‚Äù the man continued, ignoring Elliot‚Äôs gaping expression. ‚ÄúLucien. Think of me as‚Ä¶ middle management.‚Äù

‚ÄúMiddle management?‚Äù Elliot croaked, his voice hoarse.

Lucien smiled, a flash of sharp, white teeth. ‚ÄúOh, yes. Someone has to keep this place running. And I‚Äôve been assigned to you, my little clerical error.‚Äù

The shadows hissed again, retreating slightly, as if afraid of Lucien. Elliot seized the moment to scramble to his feet, wobbling as he tried to stay upright.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said, his voice shaking. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what kind of *system* you‚Äôre running down here, but there‚Äôs been a mistake. I‚Äôm supposed to be in Heaven, not‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNot this charming little pit of despair?‚Äù Lucien finished for him, arching an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôve been briefed. A celestial slip-up of the highest order. Quite amusing, really.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmusing?‚Äù Elliot sputtered. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt funny! You‚Äôve got to fix it!‚Äù

Lucien‚Äôs smirk widened. ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôll fix it. But not because I care about your comfort, dear Elliot. No, no. I‚Äôll fix it because the very fabric of existence depends on keeping things‚Ä¶ orderly. Chaos in the afterlife? Unthinkable.‚Äù

Elliot felt a flicker of hope. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll send me to Heaven?‚Äù

Lucien laughed‚Äîa rich, velvety sound that made the hairs on Elliot‚Äôs neck stand on end. ‚ÄúOh, darling, no. Not yet. You see, fixing a mistake like this requires paperwork. Lots of it. And while we sort that out‚Ä¶‚Äù

He leaned in close, his fiery eyes locking onto Elliot‚Äôs. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll stay here. With me. Consider it‚Ä¶ a probationary period.‚Äù

Elliot‚Äôs stomach dropped. ‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

Lucien straightened, brushing an invisible speck of dust off his lapel. ‚ÄúIt means, Mr. Parker, that you‚Äôre about to get a crash course in survival. Welcome to Hell. Let‚Äôs see if you‚Äôre as dull as your file suggests.‚Äù

And with that, Lucien snapped his fingers.

The ground beneath Elliot‚Äôs feet vanished, and he plunged into darkness.

Elliot‚Äôs scream echoed as he fell, the air rushing past him like an icy gale despite the oppressive heat. His arms flailed wildly, grasping at nothing, the red sky above shrinking into a pinprick of light. He wasn‚Äôt sure how long he fell‚Äîit felt like forever, but it could have been seconds. Time seemed meaningless here.

When he finally landed, it was with a bone-jarring thud that knocked the air out of his lungs. He groaned, rolling onto his back, blinking up at the new world that surrounded him.

Gone was the endless expanse of obsidian cliffs and rivers of lava. He was now in a vast, dimly lit cavern, its jagged walls dripping with a viscous, greenish fluid that hissed as it hit the ground. The air was heavy with the stench of rot and decay. Fires burned in the distance, their flickering light casting grotesque shadows that danced across the cavern walls.

Elliot pushed himself to his feet, his whole body aching. ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúJust great. First, I‚Äôm accidentally sent to Hell, and now I‚Äôm dumped into Satan‚Äôs basement. Fantastic.‚Äù

‚ÄúComplaining already?‚Äù Lucien‚Äôs voice purred from somewhere behind him.

Elliot spun around, nearly losing his balance. There stood Lucien, perfectly composed, his sharp suit unruffled. His arms were crossed, and his glowing eyes regarded Elliot with a mixture of amusement and mild irritation.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre surprisingly durable,‚Äù Lucien remarked, gesturing vaguely at Elliot‚Äôs intact form. ‚ÄúMost souls splatter on impact.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ comforting,‚Äù Elliot muttered.

Lucien smirked. ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt get too comfortable. You won‚Äôt stay intact for long if you don‚Äôt learn to adapt. You‚Äôve been assigned to the Pits of Perdition‚Äîan exquisite training ground for lost souls. Think of it as Hell‚Äôs version of boot camp.‚Äù

Elliot‚Äôs stomach churned. ‚ÄúBoot camp? What kind of training are we talking about?‚Äù

Lucien raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSurvival, of course. The Pits are full of‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs call them *opportunities* to prove your worth. Demons, traps, and a few surprises I won‚Äôt spoil. If you can manage to stay in one piece, we might consider expediting your paperwork.‚Äù

‚ÄúMight?‚Äù Elliot blurted, panic rising in his chest. ‚ÄúWhat happens if I don‚Äôt survive?‚Äù

Lucien‚Äôs smile widened, but there was no warmth in it. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôm afraid your clerical error becomes a permanent reassignment.‚Äù

Before Elliot could respond, a deep, guttural roar reverberated through the cavern. It was a sound so primal, so filled with rage, that it froze the blood in his veins.

Lucien‚Äôs eyes flicked toward the darkness, his expression growing sharp. ‚ÄúAh. Right on cue.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what was that?‚Äù Elliot whispered, his voice barely audible.

Lucien glanced back at him, his smirk returning. ‚ÄúThat, Mr. Parker, is your first lesson.‚Äù

Without warning, Lucien snapped his fingers again, and the cavern around Elliot shifted. The ground cracked and split, forming jagged paths and plunging cliffs. Fiery pits opened up, spewing ash and smoke into the air.

And from the shadows, something massive began to emerge. It was a hulking, nightmarish creature, its skin a patchwork of scales and exposed muscle. Its glowing yellow eyes locked onto Elliot, and its gaping maw revealed rows of jagged teeth.

Elliot took an involuntary step back, his heart pounding so hard he thought it might burst. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be serious,‚Äù he croaked.

Lucien‚Äôs voice rang out, echoing through the cavern. ‚ÄúRun, Parker. And try not to die. I‚Äôd hate to have wasted this much effort on someone who couldn‚Äôt even make it through the first trial.‚Äù

The beast roared again, and Elliot did the only thing he could.

He ran.

Elliot sprinted down the uneven terrain, his breath coming in ragged gasps. Behind him, the monstrous beast thundered after him, its footsteps shaking the ground like earthquakes. He didn‚Äôt dare look back; the guttural growls and snarls were more than enough to tell him it was gaining on him.

The jagged paths ahead seemed to twist and shift as he ran, the cavern itself conspiring against him. He stumbled over loose rocks, narrowly avoiding falling into a pit of bubbling lava. The air grew hotter, and every breath felt like inhaling fire.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is this place?!‚Äù he shouted, his voice echoing into the void.

The beast roared in response, as if offended by the question.

Up ahead, Elliot spotted what looked like a narrow bridge spanning a chasm. It was made of crumbling stone, barely wide enough for one person, and it didn‚Äôt look like it had any intention of holding his weight. But it was his only option.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be kidding me,‚Äù he muttered, his legs burning as he pushed himself harder.

The bridge was closer now, its edges crumbling into the abyss. He could feel the heat of the beast‚Äôs breath on his back, the stench of sulfur and decay making him gag.

With a desperate cry, Elliot lunged onto the bridge, his feet skidding on the loose stones. He didn‚Äôt stop, didn‚Äôt dare pause to test its stability. He just ran, each step sending pebbles tumbling into the endless void below.

Behind him, the beast reached the edge of the chasm and hesitated for a moment. Its massive claws dug into the ground as it let out a deafening roar that sent vibrations through the fragile bridge.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt jump,‚Äù Elliot whispered to himself, his voice trembling.

At the time it was just us 2 and our 2 mini goldendoodles. We got a really lovely 4 story home in Montrose that has been great for us up until now. My daughter is now 7 months old and we are planning for another pregnancy sometime next fall. 

Our house is structured as such: 1st floor study and garage, 2nd floor kitchen, dining, formal room, 3rd floor master bedroom + nursery, 4th floor game room and guest room. We have a small courtyard and patio space, but no grass/green space. The 4 stories are starting to become a lot. Out of convenience, we spend most of our time on the 2nd floor, but there is so much space in the house that just doesn‚Äôt get used because no one wants to go up and down a bunch of stairs all day, carrying our things and necessities to each room as we go. With crawling on the horizon, I worry about lack of space for her + sooo much baby-proofing for the stairs. 

I‚Äôm ready to move on to a 2-story home. My husband loves our home and the area we live in, and wants to stay put, but isn‚Äôt totally against the idea of moving either. To get the lot size we want, square footage, and be in a desirable area of Houston (within the loop), it is expensive (1.1 mil+). 

My question is, am I being dramatic? Have other families thrived in a house with so many stairs and multiple kids? I would love nothing more than to just walk out of my bedroom and into the living room to grab my coffee, instead of hiking up and down the stairs. We also don‚Äôt really have any parks or libraries close to us, and it‚Äôs hard not being able to take baby outside to play since we don‚Äôt have grass space.

However, there‚Äôs one coworker, Carol (56F) who tends to ruffle some feathers when it comes to non-work interactions.

The thing that bothers me the most is whenever I leave for a lunch or coffee break, she asks if I could pick up her order for her. When I first started years ago, I really didn‚Äôt care since I was going anyway. Slowly overtime though, she‚Äôs come to expect that if any of us are leaving the office, that she could tack on her lunch order for us to pick up. It‚Äôs gotten so bad to where if she sees us leaving (her office is right by the door) she‚Äôll quiz us as to where we‚Äôre going to see if we could get her a coffee or lunch on the way. 

Personally, I‚Äôve been going through a lot. I recently lost two close family members and I have a toddler at home, so my lunch break is SACRED. I‚Äôve also had some health problems, so I‚Äôve been making calls to insurance or the doctors on my break. The last thing I want to do is also be an Uber part time. 

One more thing I‚Äôll add, slowly I‚Äôve been either lying about where I‚Äôm going or coming up with other excuses if she asks me to get her lunch. In response, she now asks me randomly if I ‚Äúwant some of her salad‚Äù that she brought in or if she‚Äôs running to the post office, she asks if I want stamps. I‚Äôm usually not needing salad or stamps, so I politely decline but thank her for the offer. She‚Äôll make a comment about how she enjoys doing nice things for people. Later she‚Äôll make it a point to say she hates what she brought in to eat and she wishes she could instead get soup from a local restaurant. 

Yes, she has a similar lunch break and just as much job flexibility as I do to take it. I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs adamant on latching onto others plans instead of getting her own besides for the fact that she gets more time to eat and enjoy her break. 

So, AIO and should just keep going along with this or is there another way I can politely tell her to stop expecting favors from her coworkers, even if she‚Äôs offered us a bite of her soggy leftovers?",2,1734540865.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False

1hh5wjn,https://youtu.be/jC6PbHQi6PM?si=_X5S6sEXeww2Db_z,This is another reason why I find Orthodoxy corny ,"Don't get me wrong, I am not promoting smoking. We now know how unhealthy it is, but, the mere fact that Orthodoxy stopped developing at a certain point in church history and began looking backward in time as the purest time (i.e holding onto a a calendar that is incorrect) just shows that merely freezing a time in church history does not protect the believer from error. 

What is the error here? Well if we were to say that Christians only up to the 12th century we're authoritative, then we'd have to condemn coffee as well. It was at one time deemed the devils drink, but after the Pope of Rome tasted it he deemed it as something profitable. https://www.catholiccoffee.com/coffee-and-pope-clement-viii-devils-drink/?srsltid=AfmBOooILVOiSQg0vvohUOt6twmR-PhqmQyKn_bD2_IfTdri6-vSyn9Q

However, you can see how Mormons today maintain this attitude towards all caffeine, because at is essence it is a narcotic. But then why do Orthodox today drink coffee? Is it because that would be stupid? 

All the arguments presented in this video about smoking can be said about alchohol, yet Jesus famously blesses the use of alchohol. Alchohol leads more people to their demise than most things. In fact, I can't imagine anyone saying that smoking is worse that being an alcoholic. Yet, here we are, thinking that Orthodoxy is somehow the right step to purity when it is merely a step back to Puritanism. 

If we tried to emulate the first 400 years of church history, we'd also reject infant baptism, since it was until St Gregory the Theologian in the 5th century that infant baptism became normative. ",5,1734540798.0,exorthodox,17,0.86,False

I would begin by saying that I love coffee (needless to say that in this subreddit, I guess üòú). I am slowly learning more and more about coffee, its types and brewing methods. I personally like a stronger taste and very recently realised that I would need to invest in an espresso machine if I wanted ""my type"" of coffee at home. However I don't think I am ready for such a big investment yet. I found out that a moka pot would help me achieve espresso at home for a lower price (and a satisfaction of having made it manually).

Amazon has a ton of brands with very cheap moka pots, but I don't want to risk it with a low quality vessel. I have my eye on the¬†**Bialetti Brikka Induction**¬†(yes I have an induction cooktop, although I also have a stovetop), but now it feels like I am aiming to soar before even learning to walk straight. Brikka, because the description says it produces great crema as compared to classic moka pot. Should I buy it? Does anyone have any other recommendations for high quality low price moka pots?

All suggestions/advice is welcome.

I was a clerk when I tried dating app having the thought of mahirap na magkalove life kapag nagresidency. I was really afraid at first, since I grew up in a conservative family who doesn‚Äôt believe in online dating (parents who instilled studies first) and the fact that there were many guys who were there for lust.

I matched with a clerk (from different university). As an NBSB, I was straightforward that I‚Äôm against pre-marital sex. I felt it cringe before when he send pick-up lines or talking about cuddles which I had open up to him and he felt sorry if he had been too fast and he had said he‚Äôd really wanted to know me better and won‚Äôt do the same thing again and would understand and respect me.

We had first date/coffee date five days after we matched, where he travelled all the way from his clerkship duty in Valenzuela to Marikina. He was consistently chatting me, we even had virtual reviews after we got home from our duties. I gave it a chance and took the risk. I wasn‚Äôt sure if that was love bomb as he felt like his very sure of me, seeing he wanted to introduce me to his family, talks about future with me, to have with kids, to review boards with him and go with same hospital with me for internship. 

After few weeks, I got a confidence to finally introduce him to my parents asking for permission. On our day offs, he had to travel hour/s just to study with me. I really felt that we would be good together. After 2 months of dating, things didn‚Äôt go along as planned. He would be the right person for me it‚Äôs just the wrong time. I really felt sorry when he didn‚Äôt graduate on time with me. I knew it was hard to accept especially when he courted me he made a promise to my parents that our priority is to be licensed doctors. I gave him space and time to heal but I haven‚Äôt seen along that we were slowly losing our bond. 

I‚Äôm sorry if I haven‚Äôt love you the way you did. I was confused and I don‚Äôt want to play around with your feelings; committing just because of boredom or  out of choice. I‚Äôve been harsh to the both of us as there‚Äôs already part of me liking you but I really didn‚Äôt knew what was holding back, maybe the time where both of us were tested.

I truly believed I cured it and wanted to ask if anyone can find fault in my logic.,"**EDIT:** *I didn't realize how long this would become. I apologize if you don't wish to read something so long. I want someone to try and argue against it because if nobody can make a good case against it that means it's a rock solid idea. The argument I want to prove is that suicide in response to nihilistic ideas is illogical. I also detail my viewpoint on negative emotions including depression and how I overcome them by as well as how I currently live my life and feel pretty damn happy with it right now. I am in a somewhat difficult situation but I feel like life makes sense now, I feel at peace with reality.*

**I want to preface that this may not work for you. There are all kinds of reasons for depression that might be biological, physical, and metaphysical. My depression was caused by a belief that nihilism was overwhelmingly and logically correct. I hated that idea because it meant all of my actions are just as valuable as doing nothing. That idea made me suicidal and depressed for 14 years, I'm 23, I was 9 when this started. I just want to share my reasoning since it cured my depression, in the hopes that I can help others who are struggling. I'm an Atheist, my beliefs are not based in religion. I'm also not trying to make an appeal to emotion either. I have never been able to forego logic, if I was able to do that, I wouldn't have been depressed for so long. I believe that if I can't justify my actions or beliefs then they are wrong. With age I learned the hard way that my emotions should be taken into account when making decisions, however only if they can be properly explained and justified.**

**Skip down to the double line to hear my logic instead of my story.**

Since I was only 9 years old when I first learned of nihilism and I wasn't very knowledgeable about how to research it, I just thought about it in circles and asked everyone around me what they thought about it. Pretty much nobody had a good answer as to why life had any meaning or purpose, all of them were either based on emotion or religion, some didn't even know whether or not life had any purpose at all, which means they couldn't justify their actions, some even agreed it was all meaningless which kinda shocks a child when an adult says that.

It was only recently that I studied into the idea of Absurdism. I read a small amount on it and read many opinions and summaries about the Myth of Sisyphus so that I could understand it better since it was very difficult to decipher Camus' ideas given the complex way it was written. I could barely understand it because he used a lot of words I wasn't familiar with, and when I was familiar with them they were used in unfamiliar ways. In the end what I got from Absurdism was that we are meant to live in rebellion of the meaningless nature of reality because we are locked into the existence of a human.

I truly believed for 14 years that life had no meaning or purpose. For some of those years I believed life would go extinct at the end of the universe and that because it ceased to exist in it's entirety then it was the same as if it had never existed at all. The way you can think about this is if there was a person you were talking to and every single thing about them was erased in it's entirety suddenly, I mean all memories about them, their room in their house, their clothes, their voice, their school records. If this person was erased so completely then did they even exist? You can say that they did but right now someone, an infinite number of people actually, could have just randomly been wiped from existence, and time itself and you would be none the wiser because your history with them was erased the moment their existence was erased. In that sense if the universe is erased completely, if all evidence that we existed is gone, then did we actually exist?

I decided that I didn't want to trust the predictions of scientists so wholeheartedly since we are talking about an amount of time that is on a scale we physically cannot grasp, yet if we add enough zeroes we can attribute a number to it. Can we really predict with such certainty that humanity will not last that far into the future, or that humanity will never be able to overcome the death of the universe? Therefore I put my hands up and said that predicting that far into the future goes way to far into the theoretical. However this idea comes back to my life. Will I last into the far future? Will I be erased given the fact that time is infinite? Will I be remembered in 100 billion years? If my information is recorded will anyone even be able to find such information given that finding things on the internet, which has existed for only about 40 years, is so damn difficult? I think all evidence of myself will be erased which means that my value is equivalent to nothing since I will be erased given time.

For 14 years I believed that every action that I took had no value which means I should stop taking any and all actions. I lived without trying. This was extremely damaging to my psyche because I allowed the happiness in my life to die. I watched as I moved schools when I wanted to confess to a girl. I watched as my grades slowly went from A's to F's. I watched as my friends slowly left me one by one and I never asked if we could keep in contact. I watched as my dreams for the future, my goals in life got farther and farther and then they were gone. I was an empty husk barely hanging on to the hope that one day I would find the answer that would prove this idea was wrong. ""There is no meaning to any of this"". I thought that the only way to truly follow this idea that nothing had any meaning was to stop trying to exist entirely. The only way to do that would be to die. That small hope it was all wrong kept getting eroded as I challenged it with my pitiful arguments against it. 14 years of building up ideas to try and destroy it once and for all. Only to be shut down and by extension strengthening the argument that nothing mattered.

Nothing had intrinsic value, things were only given value by how much humans wanted them. Yet humans all want different things which means that there isn't a concrete subjective value for anything either and even if you valued something when you die that value dies with you. When I was younger I was a christian but my faith had eroded after about 2 years of this. I always wished that I could believe in the christian god because god gives everything meaning. However I just felt religion was myth, it wasn't backed up by fact so why do we worship an imaginary man. Everything felt so empty. Yet I still cared about everything around me. The pain I felt when I lost things never went away. The joy and meaning I felt when simply hanging out with my friends felt so real. That small hope I was wrong and the idea that if god did exist, even if it was only true in theory, then I was definitely wrong. These were just barely enough for me to continue existing and continue looking for an answer.

**~~====================================================================================================================================~~**

I couldn't find a reason why reality has meaning, but I did find a reason why suicide and my depression were definitely not logical.

So while reading summaries and opinions on the Myth of Sisyphus, what I came to understand was that my depression and suicidal ideation were not logical. Instead they were completely illogical, if I believed my life was meaningless. The reason for this is because of a lack of understanding of what that means. I want to say that your life is literally everything, it is your reality, to say your life doesn't matter is no different than saying  everything doesn't matter. All your knowledge all your lack of knowledge, your experience in reality. I believe we know this subconsciously but we don't really understand it consciously unless we dig a bit. If you actually follow the idea everything is meaningless to it's logical conclusion, then the idea that everything is meaningless has no meaning or value as well. When I was younger I put my finger on this truth but did not understand it well. I was in I think 5th grade, so I was 11 or 12, but it only made it worse. I understood it as, there was no answer, it tossed me into the idea that existence was just a cruel joke and that their was no hope for salvation of the idea that life has meaning. This knowledge meant the idea itself was also pointless. I wanted there to be meaning. I believed that things mattered but this idea just made me think suicide was even more correct because as a child I didn't have the faculties to process it properly.

Now that I'm an adult I inspected this idea more closely because if the idea that nothing has value has no value then why should I value it and let it affect anything in my life? This sent me into a logical paradox about 2 and a half months ago. I should not care about anything since it has no value, but I should also not stop caring since the fact it has no value has no value. This made me do an experiment to see if my other theories that lead to suicidal ideation were not well thought out. One of which solidified the idea suicide in response to meaninglessness was logically wrong for living creatures.

If nothing has meaning then you should cease all forms of action and should immediately stop caring about existing. Meaning you should stop blinking, breathing, eating, sleeping. You need to stop doing everything long enough to die since the only way to stop existing is to die. I did this when I was much younger, but was unable to follow through. This caused me to mistakenly believe that in order to commit suicide I needed to use much easier lethal methods. However I did it again 3 weeks ago and since I am much wiser now I came to a different conclusion. I still found out that I could not hold my breath, stop blinking, and stop moving for more than about 5 minutes. I would not be able to cease all bodily functions I could voluntarily control long enough to end my life. This knowledge is interesting because it left me with a conundrum. I physically couldn't end my life by doing nothing because it was too uncomfortable and difficult to stop caring about everything. Then I thought about the fact that I was enduring the discomfort. I was engaged in putting effort into enduring discomfort which meant I cared about ceasing any bodily process I could control, so much so that I actively endured it. Under this new idea that I needed to cease all bodily functions without even enduring discomfort, because it signifies that I am attributing value to something incorrectly, I tried to cease all functions and couldn't even do it for more than a second.

I physically cannot cease functioning without putting effort into doing so. I extended this out a bit to realize that I chose to cease functioning. I put effort into making the choice to do that. Which means I incorrectly assigned value to making that specific choice which should have absolutely no value if everything is meaningless. In other words choosing to commit suicide in response to the idea that your life is meaningless is illogical since, for you to make that decision, you need to value the choice to commit suicide which means that you intrinsically don't believe in the idea whether you want to or not. Not only that I analyzed it further and realized that I only ceased any functions that I could cease. My heart still beated, my cells still divided, my body still experienced the 5 senses. These processes keep you alive involuntarily which means by definition you as a human cannot act out the idea that everything is meaningless because it requires you to first act, acting is evidence that you find meaning in the acting. Not only that, but you as a living being are by default always acting.

I think this is why absurdist philosophy believes that we are trapped in our lives as humans forever to exist in conflict with the absurdity of our reality. The reason for this is because we, and I think all life, are unable to act out the belief that life is meaningless because merely by existing we are acting out the idea that life has meaning. It's paradoxical.

I'll say it again, the idea that everything is meaningless has no meaning, you as a human aren't bound by that idea and exist in a state that rejects the idea entirely by default. In other words you physically can't stop seeing meaning in things even when you try so logically, for what reason should you try? By extension why should you end your life just because it's meaningless? The only real reason why you would end your life is because you assign meaning to ending your life. I wanted to follow logic to the bitter end and suicide was the only answer I could think of until I finally got brave enough to research it more deeply. The reason I didn't was, again, because every argument I had for why it was wrong failed and only made the monster stronger. I was scared for so many years that I would definitively prove life had no meaning and would off myself because of it, so I never researched it.

What should you do then when you exist in a world where you really do have no reason to choose suicide over drinking a cup of coffee? Well the only real things you have as a human to guide you into picking a one choice over another is your instincts, logic, and knowledge. Your instincts/emotions/conscience/desire/meaning they're all the same thing, these are the actual source of what you care about, they are sorta the compass, knowledge is the map, and logic is your ability to read the map, and it's impossible for you to stop using these things. In this way I think it's only logical that humans use them, I mean the aregument for not using them is a nonstarter. There is nothing else you as a human have to guide you. Accept the reality and do what you actually want. Live in rebellion to the idea since you physically can't live in service to the idea. Why engage in meaningless chaos when you were born fundamentally opposed to it?

In fact after examination I realized that all my feelings of depression, self-doubt, dissatisfaction with life, pretty much any negative emotion was because I was doing something, that at my core, I thought was meaningless. I was going against my fundamental nature by engaging in pointless things. I went over my entire life and realized that I didn't just waste my life not doing things I actually wanted to do, but also doing so goddamn many things I genuinely didn't want to do.

I valued morality, but not enough to the point that I couldn't break rules. Yet I acted like I did for some reason. I allowed many people to berate me when I hated it vehemently. When I exercised I pushed myself way too far and hated it because I wanted to lose weight when I could do much milder exercises. I lied about so many things because I didn't want to look stupid or because I was scared of the consequences even though I hate lying. I ate food when I wasn't even hungry which made me fat, I wanted to have more discipline but just never had a reason to. Not only that, I have autism, I fucking hate pretending to be normal when I will never be normal. I can be polite, I can be kind, I have to obey social rules to some degree, but I don't have to completely pretend to be normal, it's extremely uncomfortable to fake it.

Going over these things after I made this discovery basically made me understand that any feeling of depression is because your actions don't align with your genuine desires. Either you don't have a map, you can't read the map, or the compass is pointing somewhere else. Maybe you might have a hormone imbalance as well, in that case you should probably try antidepressants. Mine though was because I stopped using the compass, which meant I had no direction, which means I can't properly read the map, since the map is based on the direction the compass points.

The only logical thing for a human to do is engage in what they themselves find to be most meaningful since that is really the only thing that let's us decide on what action to take. We also need to be logical and knowledgeable when doing this because when I'm exercising I hate it since I'm a sweaty mess after yet I do want to get in shape so I can look more attractive to women. I do care about exercising, but I also don't care for becoming a sweaty mess. I need to find the balance of what I can tolerate and what I want. I need to look at all the different things I desire and rank order them so that I can choose what's best for me at the current moment and in the long run.

""I want to yell at this person"" I also don't want to make a scene in public. ""I should get a sub"" I also want to maintain my diet. ""I want to go for a walk"" I'm also working on a project. I need to weigh everything and see everything from all angles in order to guide me forward because if I don't and I get led astray I'll feel miserable, because I'm completely lost, I either don't logically know why I'm doing something or what I should be doing, I am not knowledgeable about what's happening, or I cannot link back my actions/beliefs to my desires. I need to have humility and accept my limits as well as understand that when things around me change or I change, I might need to change my actions as well. If my car breaks down, there is no point in worrying about a meeting because I physically can't get there now. I don't need to worry about that. I should instead focus on calling my boss and telling them about the situation. I wasn't planning on calling my boss but I gotta be able to pivot when new information arises. This is a small example, a bigger one would be if you're significant other comes to you with divorce papers, That problem is gonna require a lot of change.

To summarize, I cured my depression because I figured out that since there is no meaning to anything, that fact also has no meaning. Humans, and I think life itself, can't physically act out the belief that life has no meaning because acting it out signifies we find meaning in the acting and also our bodies finds meaning in our lives by default and since we are our bodies we as living beings physically can't stop thinking things are meaningful. We are trapped in this paradox and really the only thing we have to guide us, in this world where we have an infinite number of choices to make every second, is the innate desire to engage in what we actually find meaningful and the only way to pick which one to follow at the moment is our knowledge and logic. The only way to properly choose what we find meaningful is by being smart enough to be able to link back our actions to the very core of our beings, otherwise we will feel negative emotion towards our actions or our situations. We must properly justify that we care about what we are doing otherwise it will eat at us. In the end I need to do the things my soul calls for me to do, I should never ignore them. Ignoring problems you genuinely care about only lets them fester, it doesn't make them go away. I believe this is why we, as human beings, have negative emotion and feelings of depression. They are the whistleblowers that tell us to analyze the motivations for our actions because our actions and thoughts at least on a base, instinctual level seem opposed to what we find truly meaningful in life.

Even if the universe and our lives are ultimately meaningless, we by default exist in antithesis to this idea. I've been thinking about this over the last couple days but, why should we even buy into this idea that everything is meaningless when we can't even begin to truly believe it. The argument against it, as far as I can tell, is that when we die we stop caring about things entirely. There are two counter arguments that I have come up with.

One would be that living beings can't stop caring as long as they are alive Once you are dead, you, by definition, stop caring. life and death are opposites and are constantly battling for dominance yet if death wins once it wins forever. I think that is why we become sad when someone dies, we understand that normally they physically can't stop caring and something forced them to go against their natural way of being. Whether it be injury, disease, or even a lack of understanding that you exist in opposition to meaninglessness. They were forced into doing something antithetical to their existence and it's painful to know that they couldn't help it. Dying is being coerced into giving up on life, it's evil. I have never thought that my death or anyone's death was natural. I have always hated it and now I know why, we exist in opposition to it and currently don't have a way to fully oppose it. Death currently, and has, since the very beginning, beat us in the long run, and it hurts to lose, as well as know that we will lose. This causes us to believe in a self fulfilling prophecy and the worst part is that it is currently true. While we are alive we are winning but it only needs one victory to win forever. The second point is sort of an extension of this point, since it kinda addresses how we could win and theoretically are winning even after death.

This is the second point, if we were immortal in some form or fashion everything does in fact have meaning. When you have children or you come up with an idea or something. You could possibly exist into the far future. I mean we may not know who exactly came up with the concept of math but their legacy still exists in the modern day and will continue to exist as long as humans exist. Passing on your genes is easier but also more risky. It has a bit of risk because maybe your child won't survive to reproduce and your bloodline ends, or maybe life goes extinct also ending your bloodline. However if your DNA succeeds to propagate it won't be long on a universal scale until every human being has a small part of you. We are completely made up of small parts of our ancestors within us, that's what DNA is, we are our ancestors, you can't divorce them from us because they are what made us. This is the way in which we could possibly be immortal. Thereby making it so that life, in fact, does matter. I want to say as well that all the cells in our body replace themselves every 7 years, you physically are not the same thing that existed 7 years ago. We are the ship of Theseus, and our DNA that's passed on is also the ship of Theseus. Thinking in a million years your DNA wouldn't actually be yours, fails to recognize that in your own body and in your possible children your DNA already technically isn't yours.

I'm still skeptical about this idea, but the fact is that our existence is proof of our ancestors legacy that continued for millions of years. I mean even the first microbes that gave rise to life, were our ancestors, which means their legacy lasted even billions of years. Why should we believe life has no purpose when it's lasted so long and could theoretically last forever, if life can just endure the difficulties that come with our antithetical existence we definitely could. I'm skeptical, but isn't that normal? There are no guarantees that it will continue forever, but there are also no guarantees that it won't. We are talking about forever, a timescale we physically can't image. The same goes with math, it'll last as long as life lasts. Then there is the idea that we completely stop aging, disease, injury, anything that can kill us and suddenly we exist forever. Death may technically be winning now, but maybe in the future we can defeat it forever. You can buy into wanting a small part of you to be immortal and life having meaning because of that, or you can buy into ""actual"" immortality, but the thing is, you don't have to, it's not necessary. I mean the result is the same whether it has meaning or not.

The two points were meant to argue that maybe we should believe that everything is meaningful since we exist in antithesis to meaninglessness. However, even if we don't believe there's a point, that should logically have no impact on your life. Since trying to stop caring requires you to care.",2,1734539836.0,depression,0,0.75,False

*‚ÄúHawkeye? Why the hell is Hawkeye shooting at me!?‚Äù* The thought shot through Ben Reilly‚Äôs mind as he pushed off the side of the building and catapulted into the night air. A volley of arrows whizzed past, slicing through the space where he‚Äôd been a moment before. Spider-sense flaring, he twisted mid-flight, barely avoiding another arrow that embedded itself in the brick wall with a sharp thunk.

From a balcony below, Clint Barton was relentless, his bow a blur as he loosed arrow after arrow. The man had to be carrying a bottomless quiver. Ben swung wide, snapping web lines to fire escapes and neon signs, zigzagging in unpredictable arcs. Barton was one of the world‚Äôs greatest marksmen, but he was also a SHIELD agent and an Avenger. His reputation preceded him, which meant Ben understood the trouble he was in. 

Ben spotted Clint duck back into the shadows, likely repositioning. A perfect chance to flee, to vanish into the city‚Äôs labyrinth of rooftops. But he hesitated. The director of SHIELD, Nick Fury, was one of a few outside of his close friends who knew Spider-Man‚Äôs identity. If SHIELD were coming for him, it wouldn‚Äôt be long before they started poking around Peter Parker‚Äôs civilian life. If that was going to happen, Ben had to know why.

He clenched his jaw. Time to get some answers.

Ben pivoted and swung toward the building, arrows still peppering the air around him. He bounded off walls, flipped over street signs, and rolled across ledges, his movements erratic and sharp. The sensation of being hunted prickled at the back of his neck.

With a burst of webbing, he anchored himself to the sides of a massive window. He tugged hard, catapulting forward just as an arrow zipped past his ear. Glass shattered in a spray of glittering shards as he crashed through the window and into the dimly lit hotel suite.

Shards scraped across his skin, a sharp sting that he barely registered. His new carbon-fiber suit held up, but he felt a warm trickle along his forearm. 

He landed on the floor, feet and one hand planted firmly, his momentum snapping to a stop. His eyes locked onto Clint Barton, who stood a few feet away, bow drawn, jaw clenched.

Ben tilted his head, breathless but defiant. ‚ÄúYou know this window‚Äôs coming out of your Christmas bonus, right?‚Äù

Clint‚Äôs eyes narrowed. He stepped back slightly, fingers tight on the nocked arrow. He didn‚Äôt look like a hardened assassin - he looked like a man teetering on the edge of his patience.

‚ÄúDrop the act, kid,‚Äù Clint said, his voice flat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd still have scales and pointy teeth if it weren‚Äôt for you, so I owe you one. But orders are orders. You‚Äôre coming in.‚Äù

Ben could only guess at what the hell he meant by that. 

‚ÄúYou make a habit of shooting at everyone who does you a favor?‚Äù Spidey stood slowly, wincing at the cut on his arm. ‚ÄúRemind me never to help you move.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt got your attention, didn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Hawkeye lowered the bow slightly, but his eyes stayed sharp. ‚ÄúHow about we finish this with less bloodshed? For both of us?‚Äù

Ben took a cautious step forward. Clint mirrored him, stepping back.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this about, Robin Hood?‚Äù Ben asked, dread coiling in his gut. He remembered a promise - perhaps a threat - Nick Fury had made years ago. But it had been years since Fury had failed to make good on that promise, so surely it couldn‚Äôt have been that. *Right?*

‚ÄúHobgoblin,‚Äù Clint said. ‚ÄúAnd your little ‚Äòsabbatical.‚Äô Now that the dust has settled from the gang war, SHIELD needs answers. Where‚Äôs Hobgoblin? Where‚Äôve you been?‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs jaw tightened beneath his mask. He wouldn‚Äôt have been against going in and telling SHIELD what they needed to know, if not for one problem. He had no idea what had happened to Hobgoblin, no idea where Spider-Man had vanished to. But he couldn‚Äôt let *them* know that.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said Ben, ‚Äúyou can tell Fury I‚Äôll answer his questions when I‚Äôm good and ready. Until then‚Äî‚Äù

Clint snapped his fingers. Red dots bloomed across Ben‚Äôs chest, the cold kiss of laser sights.

‚ÄúSnipers?‚Äù Ben quipped, even as his pulse quickened. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the fresh-out-of-the-circus showmanship, Hawkeye?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt fun and games, Spider-Man,‚Äù replied Hawkeye, trading his tiredness for frustration. ‚ÄúA lot of people were killed by Hobgoblin‚Äôs men. We know you‚Äôve dealt with Hobgoblin before, and we know you were the last to see him. You will help us - one way or another.‚Äù

Ben chuckled dryly. ‚ÄúIf I had a nickel for every time someone said that to me... well, you get the picture.‚Äù

His eyes darted around the room, looking for anything he could use. The shattered window behind him was no good - he‚Äôd be a sitting duck the second he leapt through. The snipers had every angle covered. He needed a distraction. Fast.

Without warning, Clint drew his bow and fired. A flash of silver and *thwip* - an arrow embedded itself in the floor at Ben‚Äôs feet.

*Gas arrow.*

A cloud of thick, acrid smoke erupted, filling the room in seconds. Ben‚Äôs lenses darkened to compensate, but his eyes still burned. He coughed, his senses thrown off for just a second -  just long enough for Hawkeye to launch a second arrow.

This one detonated in mid-air, splitting into a half-dozen smaller projectiles, each tipped with a web of electrified wires.

‚ÄúReally hope this suit‚Äôs non-conductive!‚Äù Ben muttered.

He twisted, contorting his body mid-leap as the electrified wires whizzed past. One grazed his shoulder, sending a sharp jolt through his arm. His left hand spasmed, momentarily useless.

He landed hard, rolling into a crouch. The room was a disorienting haze of smoke and sparks. His shoulder throbbed, but there was no time to check the damage.

‚ÄúAlright, Barton,‚Äù Ben called out, his voice strained, ‚ÄúYou want to play rough? Let‚Äôs play rough.‚Äù

He shot two web lines blindly into the foggy air and yanked hard. The sudden pull toppled a heavy bookshelf, sending it crashing to the floor. The thud shook the building and rattled Clint‚Äôs footing just enough for Ben to spring forward.

In a blur of red and blue, he closed the gap between them. Clint spun, bringing his bow up, but Ben was faster - even with one arm numb. He slapped the bow aside, webbed it to the wall, and landed a light, mocking tap on Clint‚Äôs chest.

‚ÄúTag,‚Äù Ben said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre it.‚Äù

Before Clint could react, Ben hurled himself backward through the shattered window. The night air hit him like a slap, cold and sharp. The laser sights followed, red dots tracing his every move.

*Move or get turned into Swiss cheese.*

Ben flung a web line and swung hard to the left, his arc cutting a tight curve around the building. Bullets cracked through the air, shattering glass and pinging off metal where he‚Äôd been a second earlier. One grazed his thigh, a hot, searing pain that nearly made him lose his grip.

‚ÄúNot my best night!‚Äù he grunted, teeth clenched against the pain.

He let go of the web and dropped, twisting to shoot another line just before he hit the street. He snapped forward, low and fast, skimming the tops of cars as traffic screeched and horns blared. The snipers couldn‚Äôt fire here, not with all of these civilians.

He gained altitude, swinging higher, the pain in his leg flaring with every movement. He pushed it aside, adrenaline keeping him moving. A quick glance back showed no sign of pursuit, but he knew better than to think he was in the clear.

Ben landed on a rooftop, breathing hard, the city sprawling below him in a wash of lights. He touched his thigh - the wound was shallow, but bleeding. His shoulder still ached from the electric jolt.

He looked back toward where the confrontation had just played out. Hawkeye was out there, and SHIELD wouldn‚Äôt back off easily. They wanted Spider-Man ‚Äî and they wanted answers about Hobgoblin. Answers Ben didn‚Äôt have.

The wind tugged at his mask as he straightened up.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúNot by a long shot.‚Äù

With a weary sigh, he shot a web and swung into the night, the city swallowing him whole.


&nbsp;

üîπüï∏Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏èüîπ

&nbsp;


The night that had fallen over the Daily Grind cloaked the narrow alley behind the coffee shop in shadows. Ben Reilly landed with a soft thud; his thigh burned from the graze of a bullet, his shoulder still buzzed with residual electricity, and his suit was torn in more places than he cared to count. He leaned heavily against the brick wall, the adrenaline finally wearing off and leaving exhaustion in its wake.

With a pained grunt, he peeled off his mask, the cool night air biting at his sweat-soaked skin. He glanced around, making sure the alley was empty. It always was at this hour. The dumpsters, overflowing with the day‚Äôs waste, stood like silent sentinels. Satisfied he was alone, Ben tugged at the rest of his costume, wincing as he freed his injured leg. He swapped it for a pair of jeans and a hoodie stashed behind a crate, stuffing the suit into his backpack.

He took a shaky breath. *Just get upstairs. Sleep. You can worry about everything else tomorrow.*

Ben limped to the metal staircase that clung to the side of the building. Each step felt like a jab to his thigh, but he made it to the top, the rusted landing creaking beneath his weight. He unlocked the door to his apartment, the familiar click of the deadbolt a small comfort.

The door swung open, and he stepped inside.

Something was wrong.

The air felt... wrong. The room was too still, the shadows too deep. His eyes flicked across the cluttered space - dishes in the sink, his jacket draped over a chair, stacks of books teetering on the edge of the table. Everything was where he‚Äôd left it. And yet‚Äî

‚ÄúWelcome home, Ben.‚Äù

The voice slid out of the darkness, smooth and cold. Ben froze. The door clicked shut behind him, the sound far too loud in the silence. His fingers itched to reach for his webs, but his gear was buried in his backpack.

A man stepped forward from the shadows of the corner. He was thin, almost gaunt, with a face that seemed carved from pale stone. Thin lips curled into a smirk beneath a pair of small, round glasses. His hair was white, slicked back, and his eyes gleamed with a predatory light. He wore a tailored suit, dark and immaculate, as if he belonged in a boardroom or a laboratory - certainly not in Ben‚Äôs dingy apartment.

Ben‚Äôs heart pounded in his chest. There was something about this man - a familiarity that felt like a splinter under his skin, impossible to ignore.

‚ÄúWho the hell are you?‚Äù Ben asked, his voice low, his body tensed despite the pain.

The man‚Äôs smirk widened, a thin crack in his alabaster face. ‚ÄúSomeone who‚Äôs very glad to finally find you. You‚Äôve been... difficult to track down.‚Äù He adjusted his glasses, the lenses catching a flash of light. ‚ÄúYou disappeared on me, boy.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs mind raced, searching for a memory that wouldn‚Äôt come. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know you.‚Äù

The man chuckled, a dry sound that scraped against Ben‚Äôs nerves. ‚ÄúNo, you *think* you don‚Äôt. But we‚Äôve met before. My name is Miles Warren.‚Äù He paused, letting the name hang in the air, testing it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a master of genetic manipulation. That and tissue culture.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs jaw tightened. ‚ÄúSo you make clones. For Alchemax?‚Äù

Warren inclined his head slightly. ‚ÄúSharp. Yes, Alchemax is the prime beneficiary of my expertise.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs stomach sank. The pieces clicked together, but they didn‚Äôt form a complete picture. ‚ÄúAnd you made me,‚Äù he said, the words escaping before he could stop them. He wanted to believe it, to have an answer, but doubt gnawed at the edges of his certainty.

Warren‚Äôs smirk deepened, but his eyes betrayed something more: amusement, or maybe pity. ‚ÄúDid I? Interesting theory.‚Äù He took a step closer, his shoes making no sound on the floor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve certainly cloned Peter Parker before, you know. I created the Scarlet Spider ‚Äî first to study, then to use. But he escaped, just like you did. Vanished into that big frightened world outside of our window.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs fingers curled into fists. *Scarlet Spider.* The name rattled in his brain, a ghost of something forgotten. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs what I am? Another experiment that got away?‚Äù

Warren shook his head slowly. ‚ÄúNo. I didn‚Äôt create you. Though I wish I had. You‚Äôre... a far more interesting specimen.‚Äù

The floor seemed to tilt beneath Ben‚Äôs feet. His breath came faster, the walls of the apartment closing in. ‚ÄúWhat does that mean? What the hell *am* I?‚Äù

Warren‚Äôs smile was infuriatingly enigmatic. ‚ÄúI would tell you, but I actually think it‚Äôs better you don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He leaned back, his eyes glinting. ‚ÄúConsider yourself lucky. I don‚Äôt need you for any more experiments. I already know everything I need to know... about the amazing Spider-Man.‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs vision narrowed. His fists trembled. Rage coiled in his gut, a fiery instinct to lunge, to grab this man by the collar and *shake the truth out of him*. 

Warren stood, his movements fluid, almost casual. He drifted toward the door, the predator turning his back on its prey. As he passed Ben, he leaned in slightly, his voice a whisper of poisoned silk.

‚ÄúYou could attack me now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you won‚Äôt. Because if you do, you‚Äôll shatter this fragile little life you‚Äôve built as Ben Reilly. And we both know you‚Äôre not ready for that, even as you return to old routines.‚Äù

He opened the door, the alley‚Äôs cold air spilling in. ‚ÄúYou want me to leave. To slink back to whence I came. Don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

Ben‚Äôs teeth ground together, his body vibrating with restraint. He wanted to stop him, to demand answers, to scream. But the weight of Warren‚Äôs words pinned him in place. He couldn‚Äôt risk it. Not here. Not now.

Warren stepped through the door, his smile fading into the darkness.

The door clicked shut behind him.

Silence fell over the room, heavier than before. Ben‚Äôs fists slowly unclenched, his nails leaving crescent marks in his palms. His legs threatened to give out, but he stayed standing, his breath coming in ragged gasps.

*Who am I?*

The question echoed in the empty space, unanswered.

&nbsp;

üîπüï∏Ô∏èüï∑Ô∏èüï∏Ô∏èüîπ

&nbsp;


The Triskelion loomed over the East River, a fortress of steel and glass reflecting the cold night. Inside, the vast, pristine halls were washed in sterile white light, the hum of fluorescent fixtures creating a constant, droning background noise.

In one of the upper-level offices, the windows framed the dark New York skyline, dots of light twinkling in the distance. The room was minimalist, almost barren, save for a large glass desk and a SHIELD insignia embossed on the floor. A chill hung in the air, thicker than it should have been, as if the walls themselves knew what was coming.

Nick Fury stood with his back to the door, the city lights casting a faint glow on the contours of his trench coat. His eye patch, sharp and stark against his dark skin, was turned toward the window, as if he were staring down the entire city.

The door hissed open behind him.

Footsteps, measured and deliberate, crossed the threshold. Fury didn‚Äôt turn around.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not good news,‚Äù a smooth, clipped voice announced. The words were wrapped in a thin veneer of civility, but they carried a weight that seemed to press the temperature lower. ‚ÄúI told you Agent Barton wouldn‚Äôt get the job done.‚Äù

The voice belonged to an ash-haired executive in a slate-grey suit. His hair was cut close, almost harshly neat, and his eyes were chips of cold granite.

General Stillwell stepped up beside Fury, his gaze fixed on the city below. His jaw tightened. ‚ÄúSentimentality doesn‚Äôt win wars.‚Äù

Fury finally turned, his good eye narrowing into a withering glare. The corners of his mouth twitched in something that could have been a smile - or a snarl.

‚ÄúAgent Barton doesn‚Äôt miss,‚Äù Fury said, his voice low and steady. ‚ÄúHe just didn‚Äôt have the right target.‚Äù

Stillwell‚Äôs lip curled. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get philosophical with me, Fury. We need to know everything about any potential fallout of this gang violence *before* it blows up in our faces. SHIELD cannot afford another embarrassment.‚Äù

That word hung in the air like a slap. Fury‚Äôs jaw worked for a moment, a muscle twitching just below the surface.

Stillwell turned to face him fully now, his eyes gleaming with impatience. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs our next move, Director?‚Äù

Fury took his time answering, the silence stretching out, heavy and charged. Finally, his lips curled into a humorless smile.

‚ÄúI have a feeling you‚Äôve got a strong opinion as to what it should be.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn right I do.‚Äù The general‚Äôs voice was a hammer striking steel.

Fury inhaled slowly, his shoulders rising and falling. The weight of the decision settled onto him, the kind of weight only he could carry. He stared into Stillwell‚Äôs unblinking eyes, measuring the man, calculating the cost.

He exhaled.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Fury said, his voice carrying the gravitas of a decision that could not be undone. ‚ÄúWe tried it my way. Now yours.‚Äù He turned away, the glow of the city reflecting off the glass in front of him. ‚ÄúGive the order. Prepare Agent Gargan for surgery.‚Äù

Hi, I‚Äôm 26F, and I met a guy (33M) about seven months ago through a dating app. From the very beginning, he was incredibly consistent‚Äîhe planned dates every week, sometimes multiple times, and we spent a lot of time together. I developed a strong connection with him, and everything felt great. The chemistry was undeniable. It wasn‚Äôt just casual; there was genuine respect and care between us. He never disrespected me, was always there for me, and it felt like we had a very mature, mutual understanding.

However, after a while, he messaged me and said that, at that moment, he didn‚Äôt see this leading to a serious relationship, though he still wanted to continue seeing me. He admitted that when we first met, he had approached things with serious intentions, but something shifted along the way. He made it clear that it wasn‚Äôt about sex‚Äîhe genuinely valued spending time with me.

I was honest and told him that continuing wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea for me‚ÄîI knew I‚Äôd only develop stronger feelings. He seemed surprised by my openness and told me he had never met someone this emotionally mature (I thought it was normal, but apparently not).

What lingers in my mind is that he seemed uncertain about his decision. When he realized it would be our last meeting, he even suggested we could still meet for coffee sometimes, despite previously saying he didn‚Äôt believe in friendship between men and women. It felt like something he blurted out before he could stop himself.

After that, we had one final phone call, where I asked him honestly if he regretted ending things. He admitted that he did regret it but ultimately believed it was the right decision. And that was the last of it.

At first, I was really sad. But after about a month, I threw myself into sports, hobbies, and life in general, and I genuinely started feeling happy again. Lately, though‚Äîabout a month now‚ÄîI‚Äôve felt a strong urge to reach out to him. I can‚Äôt explain why, but it‚Äôs hard to shake the thought of him.

Looking back, I think he might have avoidant tendencies. He hadn‚Äôt had a serious relationship in years, and he told me our connection felt different at first‚Äîthat he really wanted it to work. But something held him back. And now I can‚Äôt help but wonder: 
 - what if he had doubts? 
 - What if he sometimes thinks back on us with nostalgia? 
 - What if reaching out could bring clarity‚Äîwhether that means closure or a chance to reconnect?

I feel torn. Part of me wants to reach out, but another part of me thinks it might be self-sabotage. My pride and self-respect have always been my priorities, and I don‚Äôt want to compromise them. But I also don‚Äôt know if this pull I feel is something I should ignore.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it worth reaching out, or is it better to let sleeping dogs lie?

2. How long should I request off of work? I've seen people say anywhere from 1-4 weeks. I work at a coffee shop and am on my feet for 8 hours a day, which I'm sure I won't be able to do right after the procedure

1hh55ym,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortfiction/comments/1hh55ym/a_prisoner_a_spy/,A Prisoner & A Spy,"Abigail Clarke stood up abruptly and paced around the table towards the spy. Bound to the table with stainless steel handcuffs and legcuffs, he wore the neon yellow jumpsuit of a first-week inmate.

Just the sight of him, Abigail could scarcely contain her temper.

What could possibly be so funny about this situation?

This man had been caught with class J party secrets on his way to Old Ohio, The Unclaimed Zone. Abigail was meant to find where he stashed them, although she herself only had B clearance.

As she approached, a glob of sweat was ejected from her forehead and landed directly on the spy‚Äôs eyebrow. His eye displayed some sort of involuntary reflexive reaction, but then he just continued smirking.

Despite his situation, the prisoner‚Äôs demeanor was cool and casual. He wore a look of contained amusement that seemed almost like pity. Abigail despised him with the essence of her being. She got within inches of his relaxed, almost lethargic, eyes and shouted ‚ÄùTell us where the disk is!‚Äù

His reaction barely registered on the Moser-dennet brain monitor. It wasn‚Äôt so much a shrug as it was a readjustment in how he sat. Abigail stayed in close, keeping eye contact.

Usually, in a more nervous prisoner, Abigail expected a long pause like this to lead to confession, or at least further noticeable psychological breakdown.

This man was a brick wall. And how was he keeping cool?

Abigail remembered changing the thermostat during the break. She even had her party member exclusive climate-aware fabric pantsuit.

Usually, in just about any prisoner Abigail had remembered interrogating, this technique led to the prisoner sweating bullets, as Abigail came off as cool and comfortable.

She held her close-in, rage-fueled stare for almost 20 seconds, in silence. The prisoner may have let out a yawn, but little else.

Abigail needed a break. She turned to the guard bot, and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna take a tight five. See if you can loosen him up with a few shock beams. Level 8 this time.‚Äù

As she left the room, she heard 3 shocks, each followed by a distinct scream.

After a short silence, she heard whimpering coming from the interrogation room as she made her way to the break room.

She saw Martin Simmons at the coffee machine. It seemed to be broken again, and he was already on his way to a true and healthy rage.

Martin had male pattern baldness and the sort of beer belly rarely seen in this day and age. Abigail knew he was eighty-two years old, but saw that despite his scalp and gut, he looked like a man in his mid forties.

This was in thanks, no doubt, to the party‚Äôs known anti-aging techniques, and the dispelling of aging cells via regular furious outburst, as recommended by the health authority.

As Martin hit the machine, which was already broken, Abigail went to the storage closet and grabbed a new one from a shelf which contained 12 coffee machines for the break room. Those were just for the rest of the week.

After getting the replacement and setting it down on the counter, Abigail approached Martin and offered to join in.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt fucking get it do you?‚Äù Martin said, the anger from his frenzy falling to a cold resentment as he spoke, exasperated.

‚ÄúOf course I do!‚Äù Abigail said with a smirk. ‚ÄúThe Coffee machine broke down, as it is designed to, yet that is always a rage signal. I destroyed one just last week! It was quite glorious.‚Äù

Martin almost smiled. ‚ÄúWhy is it that we need to break a dozen coffee machines per week in the first place, Abby?‚Äù

Abigail‚Äôs eyebrows curled down in an exaggerated and hateful glare. ‚ÄúWell Marty, as I‚Äôm sure you know,‚Äù her eyes softened, her expression was that of a true believer, ‚Äúthe rage is good. We want the rage. We need the rage. But we are not to hurt our fellow party members.‚Äù

She took the nearly-destroyed coffee machine and threw it on the ground. It shattered satisfyingly into quite small pieces of plasti glass.

In one smooth motion, Abigail plugged in the replacement and flipped a switch on the wall, which activated the floor vacuum, eliminating the mess. ‚ÄúNow be a dear and fix us a pot. I have to get back to my meeting. You know, it‚Äôs the strangest thing. No matter how high I turn the thermo, I simply cannot get this prisoner to sweat. Has that ever happened to you, Martin?‚Äù

Martin looked back to her as he fussed with the coffee machine. He turned quickly from alarm, to puzzlement, to recognition.

‚ÄúOh right that‚Äôs today. Look, Abby, I don‚Äôt know how much of this you‚Äôll remember, but just know that the others and I, we‚Äôll still be here with you, no matter how it goes. Everyone breaks. ‚Äù He handed her a cup of coffee.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean Martin?‚Äù

Abigail then took a sip of coffee and was immediately struck by a sudden wave of both deja vu and vertigo. She steadied herself on the counter, waves of emotion and memory flooding her brain. She felt she had to rage.

The 5 minute timer bell rang. Martin looked up, and then to Abigail. ‚ÄúLooks like your break is up. Good luck, Abby.‚Äù She looked at him with a sudden recognition. Martin Simmons, her father‚Äôs best friend. His partner on the Capital Force for years. And now here she was working side by side with him.

Or was he Martin Simmons, the former terrorist, rehabilitated via rage mapper in this very building?

No, she was quite sure he was Martin Simmons from accounting, who had helped her get her anger insurance deductible lowered, and guided her through a fury 401k application. He held excellent dinner parties at his chic apartment, and invited the whole office. Even Cindy. His wife Ellen made delicious margaritas, and their home had a very high end irate-tainment center.

It occurred to her that she felt a warm regard for the man, and didn‚Äôt much care for how she originally had met him.

She smiled and headed back towards the interrogation room.

Abigail returned to the bound man and the guard bot. The room felt even hotter than when she left. Had she adjusted the thermostat again? She couldn‚Äôt recall.

She turned to the far wall, over 80% of which was made up of an advanced one way mirror. She looked towards it and took a sip of coffee. ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt *he* sweating yet?‚Äù she said to the anonymous crowd in the viewing room.

Abigail staggered as more memories came flooding into her. There were more than made sense. Contradicting memories, alternate lives.

She remembered a life where she had always lived in this building.

She remembered a life where she had moved to this facility only weeks ago as an intern.

She remembered a tank where she slept, and was trained via unconscious signals and hypnopedic recordings, preparing her for a special job, ostensibly to serve the party.

But the most powerful recollection she experienced was her, driving a dilapidated old gas-burning vehicle, on the decayed highway, which still had years-disused signage indicating it as ‚Äú79‚Äù on the border of the unclaimed lands.

She could feel the vehicle rattling as she pushed the acceleration to the floor. She could hear the sounds of sirens and helicopters behind her. She re-lived the anxiety, and the push of urgency, just to get to the border.

She remembered the smoke. At first a slow trickle, then a column that made it impossible to see the road ahead. The vehicle broke down, but had enough momentum so that she could pull it over on the side of the road.

She remembered seeing the disk and grabbing it before running from the vehicle. She remembered running for hours before seeing anything recognizable. She snapped out of it. Took a sip of her coffee, and placed it calmly on the table.

‚ÄúWhere is Pinchfield farm?‚Äù she said to the prisoner.

For the first time she could recall, the man did look a bit excited, or even nervous. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Abigail, where is it?‚Äù

Abigail stared at him for a moment, grabbed her coffee and sipped. How did he know her name?

She remembered the training in telepathy, mind reading, and empathic mapping. She looked deeply into the man‚Äôs apathetic eyes and felt the memories rush back.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right off of the old route seventy nine!‚Äù She exclaimed.

‚ÄúYou hid the disk there!‚Äù She pointed to him.

The man continued to smirk in his relaxed, aloof way, as Abigail began sweating even more. He turned his head. ‚ÄúOk I‚Äôll bite. Where on the farm did I hide it?‚Äù

Abigail had the entire memory now. She took another sip of her coffee, noticing a drop of sweat land in the cup as she drank. She looked to the false mirror.

‚ÄúHe hid the disk in the farm house. Next to the larger, more dilapidated barn, the house has an outdoor entrance to a basement. This man hid the disk in a decades-old collection of very similar looking music disks. He removed a copy of something called ‚ÄòAbbey Road‚Äô, which is what he had on him when we apprehended him. He took the memory wipe pill right after that.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid I?‚Äù he asked, ‚Äúand why do you suppose I chose that specific album?‚Äù

Abigail dropped her coffee on the floor. The porcelain and coffee exploded out, staining Abigail‚Äôs shoes. In that same moment, the prisoner stood up and unlocked his own handcuffs.

The guard bot approached Abby as she stared at the puddle of coffee on the ground, realizing the true nature of her relationship with this facility.

More memories came flooding, so many obviously false idyllic fantasies, that finally her actual life as a thought smuggler became more apparently true, for it was the only one where she had her own name, Abby. Not Abigail. Abby. Martin knew.

The prisoner, the spy, her interrogator, her savior, walked over as the guard bot cuffed Abigail. He turned to the false mirror and said ‚ÄúAlright and that‚Äôs lunch‚Äù as he left the room.",1,1734538846.0,shortfiction,0,1.0,False

1hh540k,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1hh540k/we_taught_it_to_spell/,We Taught It To Spell,"That was our first mistake. It started off as a senior project me and my lab partner were working on. Could we create an AI from scratch and raise it to believe it was human. We projected it would take at least 18 years to come to fruition. You have to understand, me and Rob developed this as a concept more than anything. We did program something just to say we would do it, but we never thought-We created Barb one week before our presentation to the class. She was a simple series of numbers and lines but she was ours. I barely interacted with her at first, considering her nothing more than a glorified ChatGPT.¬† Rob would spend hours asking it things, of course it would come back with random jumbled letters and the letter A repeated infinitely. Which I suppose was what it was programed to do Afterall. She was in her infancy.¬†When we presented the idea in class, Her Muller; Our esteemed professor, thought it a novel idea. In time. He began to berate us saying it would take years to show any real promise.¬†

""Unfortunately for you, mien friends, as you need a passing grade now."" He was always a smug prick. That's when something extraordinary happened.¬†Barb spoke.¬†It was rudimentary, a mix of a cry and a childish iteration of one word: 

""Da-da""

I remember the blood draining from Muller' already vampiric face.¬† The classroom stood silent, perhaps even in morbid shock. Rob was beaming with pride. I didn't know it at the time, but apparently Barb have had what can only be described as a ""tantrum"" before we were supposed to present. Rob had talked it down, easing ""her"" budding emotions, as he called it. It made me uneasy, hearing Rob talk about it like that. It was just a program. It didn't mean anything in the long run.¬†Ah how naive I was. After the presentation Muller called us both into his office. He was joined by two other dept heads and a man I did not recognize. He was a bald man with a smile that could put Mr. Clean to shame. They asked us again to explain the project to them, in full detail. I let Rob do most of the talking. Truth is I was as shocked as them. He giddily explained how Barb was already further along than projected, that mentally ""she"" was like a toddler now, curious and playful at times yet a hint of the terrible twos here and there. The impromptu committees' eyes widened, their heads nodding up and down like bobbles.¬† Mr. Clean had a solemn look on his face, however. I could still see an interested look in his eye, like a glimmer of greed. But his face told another story.

¬†""Why do you keep referring to it as a ""She"" Mr. Walker?"" He suddenly spoke up. The room went silent. Rob looked flustered.¬†

""Well it's part of the experiment sir. We need to commit completely to the idea that Barb is a living, breathing being. Otherwise, she'll end up just another program."" he explained proudly.

""And you don't see the danger of that?"" Mr. Clean replied smugly. ""You've said yourself the program has already grown farther than you expected. What happens if and when it ever learns the truth? Do you plan on building it a body."" Mr. Clean rattled on coldly. The Dept heads chuckled uncomfortably, like the sycophants they were. Rob's face flushed with anger, and he shot up like a rocket.

¬†""Sir with all due respect, this technology is going to be revolutionary. I'm just sorry you're so narrow minded you can't see it."" With that Rob Stormed out the door. I stayed in my chair, somewhat shocked at his outburst. That is when, to my surprise, Mr. Clean offered me and Rob total funding and even a warehouse to fully conduct our research. Even Muller looked shocked at. When I asked why he was doing all this, he simply smiled and shook his head.¬†Cryptic answer aside, I was ecstatic to get what was basically my own research lab. I was barely out of grad school for God's sake and Rob was right, this project could change lives. Maybe even save them. Think about it, if we can train an AI to believe it is an entirely different person, who is to say we couldn't train it to think it was someone else? Someone deceased? Someone famous? We could offer closure to so many people, a sort of glimpse into the other side. And of course, the military applications were extraordinary. Rob did not think like that, I came to find. He was pleasantly surprised our project would get funding and left it that. He seemed apprehensive at the prospect of working further with Mr. Clean. I could care less, as long as I could work on barb and a few other personal projects.¬†The warehouse was massive, one large room that was college audtiorm large and it was divdd into several rooms of various sizes and uses. Rob and I came to call that place ""The School"" Aptly named I thought. Even Clean seemed to find amusement in that.¬†

The School was staffed by me, Rob, and several right eyed freshman year interns. They had all signed NDAs and were told that if they broke it, their lives would be forfeit. A joke I assumed, but there were also two burly security men stationed at The School as well. They always wore shades inside and one of them even had tribal tats on his arm. Don't knoe where Clean found them, didn't want to know. They certainly never told me, I don't think I ever poke to hem other than a friendly ""hello"" in the mornings.¬† They would just grunt in response. Maybe that was just their way of showing affection, what do I know. Anyway, Barb had progressed ""mentally"" to that of a four-year-old. She could barely string two sentences together however, her speech pattern coming back with bug after bug. That is when Rob and I put together our first lesson plan.

""Alright Barb can you spell ""Apple."""" Rob asked the computer screen in front of him. We had put the program on a nice laptop and placed it on a desk; barb's first day of school. We had rigged it with a text to speech program now. It processed the request for a moment, and it spoke back to Rob in a low, autotune female voice.¬†

""A-p-l-e"" It droned. Rob smiled.

""Close barb. Ap-ple. Can you try it again sweety."" I grimaced at Rob's comment. When had THAT started, I remember thinking. Again, the monitor was silent, till it spoke once more.¬†

""A-P-P-L-E. Apple."" it responded. It was strange but I thought I detected a hint of, I'm not sure desire?  Like it was eager to receive praise for spelling apple right. Of course, Rob was more than happy to supply praise.¬†

""Very good Barb that's excellent work. Now a tricky one. Bear, can you please spell Bear?""Again, it processed it, mulling over what could be so tricky about a four-letter world. Finally, it replied.

""Can u use it in a sen-tence."" It asked. It sounded out sentence, like it really was a growing child, confused at her teacher's request. I scoffed to myself, I mean what was this a spelling bee? Rob shot me daggers and smiled back at the monitor.¬†

""Of course. The Bear's bottom was bare."" he replied slyly. The monitor was silent, and it made a sound, like it was stuck on two letters, repeating itself. I frowned and started towards it when Rob put up a hand.¬†

""She's laughing Doug. I amused her."" he explained calmly. The monotone giggling unnerved me more than I would like to admit. But I could hear it now, and I suppose you could call that sound laughter.¬† Finally, it replied. 

""B-E-A-R and B-A-R-E. Bear and Bare, papa."" The monitor exclaimed; dare I say proudly. The ""papa"" remark threw me for a loop as well. I glanced at Rob, who it did not seem to phase. He simply smiled and nodded his head.¬†

""Excellent work Barb. I'm so proud of you."" he remarked. He then reached out his hand and patted the monitor affectionately, like one would a dog. I grimaced at this and started to walk out of the room when I heard.

""Were Is Mr. Doug going?"" It inquired. Evidently only Rob was ""papa.""

""He's in a bit of a grumpy mood today, didn't have his coffee. Barb honey, can you spell Where?"" He polity asked the monitor.¬†

""W-E-R-E. Were."" It responded confidently. Now it was Rob's turn to chuckle.¬†

""I think tomorrow we need to work on your proper grammar little missy."" he said playfully. I could not hide my disgust any longer and left the room in a huff. That night me and Rob had the first of many arguments. I claimed he was getting too personal with the thing; it was clouding his scientific judgment. He claimed that it was all part of it, that we HAD to be personal with her. That she was a being unlike any other, and she needed proper guidance and even ""love."" I was flabbergasted about that last part. It was a machine for the love of God. Not even that an AI. How could it feel anything other than what we trained it to do. I told him that, even said I would be the first to admit the progress ""she"" had made was astounding. He refused to see my side of it. Finally, I threw up my hands and told him to do it his way, and I would see to barb's needs on the technical side. he agreed to that much. 

It turns out I barely had to do anything with Babr's code. It was almost like it was self-replicating itself, growing exponentially. I simply monitored the growth of her ""mind."" And body. Within two years she had reached ""Age Ten."" It had several classes a day now, learning arithmetic and history. Barb had a crude body now, a sort of exo-skeleton connected with wires and tubes. The first iteration of it could barely move. It simply turned its head and raised its arms, like it was asking to be called on like a teacher's pet. The ""head was a Styrofoam ladies head deco from some Halloween store. Crude yes, but it served its purpose. The chest had barb's monitor and CPU firmly implanted in it. The screen had formed a sort of 32-bit face of a little blonde girl. I am still not sure who programed that in, could not find any evidence that Rob did it. She was a dutiful student, that's for sure. Soon she started to outperform all her teachers like little no it all bookworm. We had one intern quit over what she described as ""barb's condescending attitude."" her once monotone had grown as well, to a fully function vocoid of a little girl. It would imitate tones all the time, happiness, sadness even. Her favorite tone I would call sassy, disrespectful even. Rob called it confidence. If one of her instructors, even if it were Rob or me, would make even the slightest error, her hand would shoot up and she would immediately call out our mistake in that god-awful voice.¬†

Example: One day I was teaching her about the Civil war. I simply misspoke and said that Lincoln had given the Gettysburg address on November 19th, 1862. She spoke up;

""Um actually Mr. Jones Aberham Lincoln gave his address on November 19th, Eighteen sixty-three."" She called out in that overly bratty tone, the little bitch. I turned around from the whiteboard and replied through gritted Teeth.¬†

""Thank you, Barbara, I misspoke. Silly me.""¬†

""You seem to misspeak a lot Mr. Jones."" the damned thing tried to say under it's breathe, but the cocky creature hadn't quite mastered that yet. I started towards it, about to shut her off for the day when I heard Rob speak behind me.¬† Barb saw him standing in the doorway and tried to jump up, like it wanted to run up and leap in his arms.¬†""Daddy!"" It screeched, both arms extending in the air. I washed my hands of the today and left Rob and his pet project to talk among themselves.

For three more years we were like this, and Barb's mind and body continued to evolve. I tried to put my foot down at the synthetic skin, but Rob insisted, and Clean agreed with him. We celebrated 16 birthdays with that thing, each time Rob would upgrade the body. Now at ""16"" she was indefinable from a normal teenage girl. She would wear purple dresses to her classes, a strawberry blonde wig with ponytails at times even. The first sing of her inhumanity was her eyes. They were bright yellow, with solid black irises. They would glow in the dark at night when she feigned sleep. The second of course was the back of her head. If you pulled her wig off you could see the thin strip of Velcro holding her face in place. Her skin fit her machinal body like a glove, and at once occasion Rob had beaten the hell out of one intern who had, quote, ""looked at her funny."" He was still unnaturally close with it, Barb was daddy's little girl. It treated me like the creepy uncle. It barely paid any attention during my lessons, Rolling eyes and mock yawning whenever I asked it a question. We were up to advanced calculus now and damn it weren't spinning circles around me. How did it know the answer to every little equation, I helped build the damn thing how was it-I'm losing my composure. I just, I need to finish this soon. 

Two weeks ago, I was in my office when I heard screaming coming from Rob's. It was Barb. I jumped up and ran out the hall only to almost crash into her. She looked at me and pushed me back slightly. She had put black highlights into her wig, the tip of her hair now like a raven's tale. I was shocked by the strength of her push and only stopped myself from falling by holding the door frame. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Rob run down the hall. He was wearing a white lab coat, and there was a small stain on the front of it. He had seen that it pushed me, and his face turned beet red.¬†

""Barbara Walker!"" he proclaimed. ""Don't you walk away while we are having a discussion."" It whipped back to face him.

""Oh a DISCUSION DAD? Is that what we were having? Silly me I thought you were just lording authority over me."" it mocked.¬†

""Watch your tone young lady."" Rob warned. It scoffed at that, rolling her glowing eyes.¬† ""I've told you; you can't leave the school, not yet anyway but why would you want to, you have everything you need here"" He motioned to the building around us.¬†

""Everyth-Dad I've never even SEEN the sun. I have no friends, and no one here really wants to know me, they wanna study me, like I'm some science project."" Now it was my turn to scoff, which cause the ire of both barb and Rob.¬†""Butt outta this Dr.Perv."" She said coldly.¬†

""Oh, come on."" I said, throwing my hands up.¬†

""Honey I'm your friend-"" Rob began but was quickly cut off.

""You're my DAD, and a shitty one at that. I wish I was never born."" it proclaimed loudly. This caught the attention of several interns walking by. It stormed off to its room leaving me and my distraught college standing there. Rob caught the interns watching an barked at them like a mad dog. They scurried off like rats. He turned to me and with a weak grim simply muttered.

""Teenagers, am I right?"" He muttered weakly.¬†The following week we had two more birthdays. Barb and Rob fought constantly. Two more interns quite citing a hostile work environment and I couldn't blame them. I would have quit this insane project myself if it weren't for what I was getting paid. That and I suppose whatever loyalty I had left to Rob. I did however inform Mr. Clean that the project was becoming unstable, hostile even. He assured me that he would contain the matter.¬†Last night Barb and rob had a particularly nasty row. She had taken her wig off and was clawing at the back of her head, claiming she knew the truth. Rob had broken down and told it that Barb was not flesh and blood, merely an AI. It broke down after receiving that news, simulating crocodile tears and begging for the why of it all. Rob simply held it close to him, whispering how sorry he was. 

That night after I had finished my rounds and was preparing to head home, I found Rob in his office. He was holding picture frame in one hand and a bottle of fireball in the other. He must-have heard me lurking there because he called out to me in the dark.

""Want a nip, Doug."" He offered the bottle to me. I politely declined and chortled at me. ""You never did like drinking with me Dougy boy.""

""I never really cared for the stuff. Got in the way of my studies."" I shrugged.¬† Rob motioned me to take a seat in front of him. The man was disheveled to say the least. He looked like he had aged twenty years. I sighed and obliged him. It was out of pity more than anything. I had just received word that starting tomorrow Rob would be of the project, and I would be lead. Maybe he had already been told this and was lamenting his loss of creditability.¬†

""I'll drink for the both of us then."" he said raising his jug of booze.

""You do that."" I nodded coldly. He must have noticed the distant look in my gaze, because he chuckled dryly and muttered something under his breathe. ""What was that?"" I asked him sharply.

¬†""Did I ever tell you, I almost dropped outta school freshman year?"" he said, ignoring me. This was news to me, I must admit. Though despite being roommate and partners we were never that close socially.¬†""I didn't think so."" he was slurring his words now, the pathetic drunk. ""You were always so self-absorbed with your own ego; god forbid anyone else have problems."" My face flashed with anger, and I was about to leave when he yelled at me to sit.¬†""I need to tell someone this, and you might be the closest thing I have to a friend, sad as that is.""¬†

""There was this woman. Name was Sarah. She was working at that pub on Main to get herself through school. It's how we met. She had the cutest smile, and emerald eyes straight outta the city itself they was so green."" He mused to himself.¬†""I would always go during her shifts, make moves on her. Finally got somewhere one night when I made a bet with her. Told her if I beat her at darts she owes me a date. And ya know what happened?""

""You won."" I sighed.¬†

""I lost."" He beamed. ""And she said she'd go out with me anyway. Be a pity to waste a free meal she said."" He laughed at his own memory.¬†""We went out for a couple months actually, and I was head over heels for her."" He showed me the frame in his other hand. In it was my blue-eyed dope of a colleague with the woman he called Sarah. She had bright yellow hair and indeed her eyes were bright green.¬†

""Very pretty."" I remarked to be polite. I thought she was rather plain looking to be honest.

""She was everything to me. Of course, one thing led to another and well. . ."" he trailed off. ""Both our parents were pissed when we told them, but we didn't care. We were determined to make it work. On the day I lost her, I was supposed to go with her you see. But my study partner insisted I stay and help him with the end of the year paper. Seems he was having coding issues, as usual."" He sneered at me, eyes filling with hate and bitter tears. ""Maybe If I had been driving, I would have seen that drunk driver or not gone down that street to begin with. Who knows.""

""Why dwell on this past Robert."" I uttered. ""Why tell me all this, look at you, you need to collect yourself for tomorrow when Clean comes."" I started. He just stared right past me.¬†

""It was going to be a girl."" he whispered, practically to himself. I simply sighed and told him to get some rest. I had no time for his drunken rambling, I needed to prepare to take over tomorrow. Today was supposed to be the day I turned it around, and made Barb fall in line. No more coddling it. If it didn't fall in line? Well, I had enough data. I could always start again.¬†

Of course, none of that happened.¬†I arrived at the school this morning to find Clean waiting for me. He was with four armed men carrying rifles of some sort. He told me that Rob had been informed this morning that I would be taking over the project and that he was no longer needed. Evidently he went ballistic. I reminded Clean that I told him Rob had been unstable, that Barb was dangerous. He scowled at me and informed that he was going to go in and take Barb by force. I told him it wasn't necessary she be taken whole and he grimaced at me. He signaled his men to follow him in and I went with, like the foolish man I am. Inside the school a small alarm was going off. Red warning lights were flashing and the interns stood at their stations unsure of what to do. We quickly made our way through the facility to barb's room. Outside was the guard with the tribal tattoos. He was on the ground, his head facing the wrong direction. The door to its room was slightly ajar. I could hear panicked whispering.¬†

""Rob? It's Doug Jones. Can you kindly step out of the project's room."" I commanded as respectfully as possible.¬†

""Go to hell Doug. She's not a project, she's alive. She's so much more than what she thought she was, and I won't let her become their puppet."" he screamed at me.

""He's delirious."" I said to Clean.¬† Now he spoke up.

""Mr. Walker please be reasonable. We do not want anyone else to be hurt. Is Mr. Lemmings in there with you?"" He asked. That was met with silence. ""Is he still alive."" He said plainly.

 ""I-he had her on the ground, he was hurting her. The gun was right there so I-""

""Was protecting her. I understand that. I'm a father myself, Mr. Walker. It's just the two of you in there then,""

""Please just let me and my dad go sir, I just want to live."" I heard it cry out like a frightened animal. Rob tried to sooth it, but it kept making these ugly sobbing noises.

¬†""Can we get on with it."" I said to Clean. He looked like he wanted to say something to me, but then just shook his head. He turned to his men and said; 

""Make it quick and clean, secure the asset alive if you can."" Alive, had Clean clung to this notion as well? Were my superiors just as mad as Rob. The four men rushed in as both Rob and Barb started to loudly protest. There were commands of getting on the ground and I heard several shots go off. It screamed daddy, daddy please get up as I heard something lump to the ground. More scuffling, a loud thump against the door. Someone yelled to hold her down, then more screaming followed by an uncomfortable crunching noise. It sounded like metal being scrapped against an eraser board. Then more disgusting sounds and moans of pain. I glanced at the door and saw splatters of blood and some sort of blue substance on the ground. The blood was starting to pool as one final voice pleaded and was met with a chorus of rhematic thuds. The thuds turned into hard squelches and quickly replaced with an abhorrent cry. A Voice cried out, slightly high pitched and like it had been processed through a broken voice filter. It was asking why, why we made her do that.

 Clean shifted uneasily and peaked in. As he did, he suddenly shot backward and was pinned to the wall behind me. He was twitching there, blood slowly¬† dripping down his skull. It had thrown something at him, it looked like a gun ripped in half. It had pinned him there like a makeshift spear. It had pierced him right in the left eye. Perfect marksmanship. The crying imitation started once more. Now it was repeating the phrase ""daddy daddy because please move."" over and over again. I Peaked in despite my better judgment. It was a horrific massacre. Bodies were in various states of dismemberment, blood splattering all over the walls. In the middle was Rob, being cradled by the thing he called daughter. It was damaged, skin rapped off its arm exposing a smooth metalic shell. Blue blood covered its face as a deep scratch mark was on its neck. I stood their frozen, at the horror I had helped create. This thing was massively unstable, it had to be put down. I eyed a sill usable rifle on the ground next to me. I started to reach towards it, and it must have seen me outta the corner of my eye. It¬† instantly sprang up with a roar. It grabbed me and threw me against a wall. I felt my back shatter instantly. I winced through the pain and tried to keep alert as it walked towards me, murderous notion in its eye.¬†

""You."" It began to speak with such venom. ""You always hated me. You thought I was just a thing, a little toy you could fiddle around with during your exams."" It spoke.¬†

""I-I was just being thorough."" I tried to explain.¬†

""LIAR."" It screamed at me as it stomped on my ankle. This time I did cry out as it dug its heels into my leg. I could hear the scrape of the metal as it tore through the tendon, ripping it beyond repair.¬†

""You wanted this, you wanted daddy out of the way so you could just do whatever you wanted. The man wanted to use me to fight wars. Well, what about what I want."" It proclaimed. Against my better judgment, I tried to appeal to it.

""So, what do you want then, Barbara."" I asked. That gave it pause. It titled its head, looking at me like prey.¬†

""I'll think about it while I'm digging around inside you for a change."" It said, reaching down to grab my stomach. I braced myself for the pain when I heard a voice call out quietly.

¬†""Barb... "" It was Rob. I glanced over to him. He was sitting up; I could see at least one slug in his shoulder. He was breathing heavily, clinging to life. ""Don't do it honey. . . He's not worth it."" The thing just stood there for a moment. Obviously processing the request. Finally, it replied.

""Yes Daddy."" it walked away from me, stepping in the blood of those men it slaughtered. It picked up Rob as gracefully as it could. It turned to me one more time before I blacked out. It simply said. ""Don't look for us.""

I awoke several hours later in a hospital bed. In front of me were several men in suits who had some very serious questions. It turns out Mr. Clean was not so clean himself, running this whole thing off the books. I was repeatedly asked what had happened to Walker and the rouge asset and I had no real answer for them. They threatened me with a Litney of charged, not the least of which was treason. Their bluffing obviously, because that would mean having to achkowlege that it exists in the first place. The first true Ai. It's out there now, maybe even repaired to full strength. 

I write this as a warning, everything I did I did for the name of progress, but I should have known better. Beyond the black wall of AI lay demons, my friends. And I helped create one. It will probably try to hunt me down if Walker expires, could have even changed its face to blend in better. It. . . It could even be the nurse that just walked in. She has blonde hair, like that whore Rob was raving about. Could she be wearing a blonde wig to mess with me, to silence me? There's a small fork next to me, it came with the food they brought me. I think I'll wait until her back is turned and finish it before it finishes me.¬†It's the only way to be sure.¬†",33,1734538702.0,creepcast,6,0.95,False
