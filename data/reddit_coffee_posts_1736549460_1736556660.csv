1hyjwfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hyjwfp/ever_had_those_beans_that_just_dont_work/,Ever had those beans that just don’t work?,"Hello folks!
I am (dreadfully) finishing a bag of Ethiopian Washed Medium-Light roast coffee from a local roaster - Hatch.

The beans in question are called Starlight which are supposed to offer a Floral, Stonefruit, Citrus note.

Now, I don’t know if it’s a taste preference, and I don’t want to insult the roaster, nor is it my intention to do so - but I don’t know if this is just a subpar coffee, poor lot, or my technique.

I’ve tried every permutation I can think of a different pours: 4:6, 5 pour, Lance Hendricks method, different t bloom times.

Tried a Kasuya V60 (slower drawdown), regular V60, Origami (basically a V60) and different ratios between 15:1 and 17:1.

Also tried Hario Switch with Hoffmans recipe. 

Tried different grinds on my ZP6 and K Ultra, different water temperatures from 94 to 96, and now…. Well, out of ideas.

Drawdowns between 2:45 and 3:45

The coffee just does not taste appealing or good - it’s hollow, has an unpleasant sour note that’s masquerading behind some hollow flavours, and - well, that’s about it.

Also tried TWW in half and full strength.

I get consistent cups, just very unpleasant flavours.

Does anyone have any pointers?

Hi, I'm a 35 year-old nerdy guy living in New England. And yes, I made a dating site for myself.

I enjoy conventions, video games, cosplaying, etc. Outside of my cosplay I have a great taste in fashion. I also like to work out to keep in shape and stay healthy. In my spare time I fill out sweepstakes and enter raffles (that I often win!).

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay(not required), geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

1hyjrqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1hyjrqx/my_review_of_scarlett_lady_western_carribean/,My review of Scarlett Lady Western Carribean Charam,"I am writing this review as we are on our way back to Miami from a 6 night Western Carribean Cruise on the Scarlett Lady. This is our first Cruise ever. Me (27M) and my fiancee (25F) have been to numerous all inclusive resorts in Jamaica, Mexico, DR and Cuba so I will somewhat compare that to this cruising experience. I will break this review down into 7 categories (Room, Food, Activities/ Entertainment, Wifi/Technology, Service, Ship, and Crowd) and and give a rating out of 10 for each category. I am going to be as comprehensive as possible. 

Room 9/10
We initially booked a lock in interior cabin during the black friday sale and we ended up being assigned to the central sea terrace with an amazing view. We got our room assigned about 30 hours prior to sailing, so don't panic. I am very grateful for this massive upgrade that saved me a fortune. The bathroom wasn't big but it wasn't small. I am 6ft tall, I didn't have any problems with the shower. The bed was comfortable. The iPad/TV is loaded with great movies. Everything in the room can be controlled with the Tablet. To anyone contemplating if they should book a terrace, please do it. I don't even think our cruise would've been the same without the terrace. We spent a lot of time together on the balcony watching the sunset, sunrise, the waves passing by, drinking coffee, admiring the ocean, watching other cruise ships dock, etc. It really does elevate your experience. 

Food 8.5/10
I've had the opportunity to try out every restaurant and food stall. People hype the food on virgin all the time. We come from Toronto, a diverse city, so we are very stern when rating the food. Don't get me wrong, virgin has some of the best food I've tasted even when compared to some restaurants in Toronto, but people make it seem like it's the best food they've ever tasted in their life. I've really loved the food at Gunbae, Razzle Dazzle, Extra Virgin, and Pink Agave. Spicy Ramen at the Galley and Late night Pizza always hits differently. The ice cream parlor had top notch gelato. One afternoon, they served indian style chicken curry at the galley and it tasted very good. The jerk chicken thigh served at Bimini was very good. I can keep going, but you get the point. Con: I've noticed they use a lot of butter/oil in their cooking and sometimes it just looks unappetizing. For example, i ordered an omelette at the galley and it was soaking in butter. Even the toast was smothered in butter to a point it was all over my fingers. I've noticed that on some occasions throughout my dining experience. I thought i just got unlucky, but when my fiancee mentioned the use of heavy oil too, I knew i wasn't the only one. Not sure if it's an American thing, but it's just not our cup of tea. 

Activities/Entertainment 8.5/10
Throughout the day, there's always something going on whether it be a workout class, or a show, trivia, puzzle challenge, bungee class, etc. If you miss one today, there's always another opportunity to book the same class again for another day. The app really outlines the daily agenda throughout the cruise. The bungee class was fun. Magic/comedy show was the highlight of my trip. The red room always had a show going on either 8pm or 10pm, but try to get there early or you'll be standing. The DJ was playing some bangers during Scarlett Night and the sail away party. Since we're on the topic of activities/entertainment, I also want to mention the punctuality of these activities. For example, when they say an activity starts at 6pm and ends at 6:45p.m. It will start at EXACTLY 6 and end at EXACTLY 6:45. Friendly reminder: the HITT workout class will make you sore for the next few days, and this is coming from someone who works out 4 days a week. 

Wifi/Technology 9/10
This kinda ties in with what I've mentioned earlier. The app is your best friend. LITERALLY everything is done on the app. The app is a bit wonky from time to time but for the most part it works perfectly. Once you get on the ship's wifi, the app looks a bit different. And it tells you everything you need to know including how much you've spent on the ship so far. Speaking of wifi, the basic wifi worked amazingly for both of us. Aside from streaming, everything else (Tiktok, instagram, Snapchat, whatsapp, you name it) worked flawlessly. My fiancee video called her mom every single day and never had an issue. Throughout the ship, the use of modern technology was wonderful. Examples include the ipad that controls the TV, lights, temperature and Blinds in your room. The wristband that is used to pay for everything on board and open your room door, JBL sound system throughout the ship, etc. I don't think they get a lot of credit for the selection of movies that are pre loaded on the tablet. It's almost as if they've went inside my head and picked out movies I'd wanna watch. 

Service 8.5/10
Service is outstanding. I meet up with the same 3 housekeepers every time i exit my room. And they always ask me if i need water in my room or if anything needs to be replaced/cleaned. The managers will come at the end of my dinner at restaurants and ask if there's anything they could improve on for the future. One night our toilet got clogged, and someone came within 15 minutes and got it resolved. Servers will ask if you have any allergies before serving you every single time. If you forgot to pack a steamer, you can call sailor services and they'll have someone deliver it to your room within 15 minutes. On our first night at Gunbae, the server brought out a cake singing happy birthday, I was so confused. Turns out I had told sailor service this cruise is a birthday surprise for my fiancee (her birthday was 2 weeks prior to sailing). It's the little things they do to make your experience a bit better that makes them stand out. The only issue we had (it wasn't a deal breaker) is the LONG wait times in-between courses at the restaurants. I am going to cut some slack as I understand they make everything fresh and the ship is full but waiting 45 minutes from finishing your appetizer to getting your main can get a bit frustrating. We were averaging nearly 1 ½ hour per dinner. It wasn't just us, I've noticed a lot of folks complaining about waiting too long for their main courses. This can get more frustrating when you're running late for a show. 

Ship 9/10
The ship is very modern and it looks very sleek too. Everything is outlined perfectly, it's almost impossible to get lost. It is not very big when compared to other ships on the dock, but it does have all the amenities. At dinners, the tables are very close to each other, we felt like we were part of another group's conversation. Since it's a newer ship, everything looks clean and tighty. You can tell the staff works hard to maintain the beauty of the ship, and it really shows. I don't think the housekeepers, people working the garbage, security, maintenance and Cleaners get a lot of credit. We don't really see them, but they are the ones keeping the ship in good shape.

Crowd 9/10
When I initially booked this cruise, and read some of the reviews, I thought there were going to be a lot of older folks on this ship. To our surprise, we weren't even the youngest people on board. We came across so many people in their 20s and 30s. On our first night at Gunbae, we were seated with 2 other couples who were in their mid 20s, it was a lot of fun. The average age on our sailing was probably 35ish. Even though our sailing was sold out, I didn't feel like the ship was overcrowded. The cruise was catered to all crowds. Half of the people spent their days in the pool, or the pool bar while the other half spent their time doing trivia and just relaxing. We are not homophobic, but it was very evident this cruise line is very welcoming of the LGBTQ community.  It was a chill cruise with a party vibe, that's the best way to describe it. 

Conclusion 9/10
Overall my rating for this cruise is a 9/10. There is some room for improvement, but I would definitely hop on this cruise again in the future. And to those that are wondering how much bar tab they should purchase. I would recommend having a rough estimate of $50 per person per night. This is based on our experience, we are not heavy drinkers. We had a couple of cocktails (average 12.5$) and specialty coffees (Average $5) and beers/coolers (average $8) throughout the day. FYI: They charge 8% tax while docked at miami and 10% tax at Bimini. No tax when sailing on international waters. Don't stress if you didn't book all the activities and events on the first day. Most of the entertainment/activities are first come first show anyways. The only things that you need to book are the workout classes, comedy/magic show, and some health related classes. I booked most of the classes in the morning or the previous night of said activity. So don't get too anxious to get on the ship and start booking everything right away (like we did) because we ended up cancelling so many things as it can get very overwhelming. It's better to just go with the flow. ",4,1736556170.0,VirginVoyages,0,0.83,False

I feel I have the right microfoam as it comes out looking like 'silky white paint' and coats the sides of my milk cup as I swirl it around (also followed the videos on how to make good microfoam) it seems i got that down. But nothing is sticking the microfoam to the top surface after i 'set the canvas'.. i dont understand. only thing i can think of at this time is the beans/grind itself. I use the starbucks 'espresso roast' blend and fine grind 15grams into my portafilter (15grams is the max my portafilter can take loosely before you say i should be doing 18g). during the shot i get a nice rat tail shape then the tail brakes and splashes into my cup after about 5-6 seconds so i feel like part of the problem here is that im not really getting that nice 'crema' top layer in my cup as a result but i swear the setting of the portafilter with the puck is correct (good wdt tool use, good tamp,15g, etc.)

\- Maybe I went too far? – I thought as I watched my poor nephew who had a lost look after using my ability. – Ugh, I know I promised that airhead, but I think this is going too far – my train of thought stopped almost instantly when the tall brown skalgan with black and white spots shook his head with new energy and between big tears said.

“W-WHAT JUST HAPPENED? THOSE MEMORIES WERE SO REAL, WHAT WAS THAT?”. His ears stuck to his head almost immediately while his tail stiffened in an almost instinctive sign of panic.

Although deep down I didn't want him to know any of this I couldn't help but feel that this was what the not so little skalgan needed “heh heh, I don't know speep, I'm just a decrepit old lady who's hallucinating from old age, right? It wasn't because I was proud or anything, but I felt strangely satisfied making fun of him.

“Don't act innocent, you know very well that this is impossible for a human, skalgan or any alien in the entire galaxy to do!” Her fur fluffed up while her voice rose, at least two octaves higher in anger and frustration in equal parts

“ah… I know I have a lot to explain to you, but please, listen to me when I tell you that everything I told you at the beginning is true, the stands are real and people with those abilities are extremely dangerous.” I sighed and said in a serious tone but loaded with a solemnity noticeable enough to make him calm down.

I interrupted him before he could even say anything “Look, I’m telling you all this because I promised your father that I would do this, he is also a stand user like me. He made me promise that I would keep you away from all this until you were old enough to understand this.” I said in a reassuring tone

“Ok, then start now because there is time and plenty of it” he said in a somewhat self-conscious tone

\-this is going to be a long and bizarre story- “Ok, then prepare yourself some tea, coffee or whatever infusion you have at home because what I am going to tell you is very long”

“So to summarize the most relevant of all that you have said, it all began with the Joestar lineage with Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando two stepbrothers who hated each other to death in Liverpool, England, in the year 1880, Dio Brando being a bad man who only wanted power and money, who in his search for power found a mask that granted powers very similar to those of the vampires of yesteryear created by an ancient civilization of very powerful beings very similar to humans that became extinct due to a war caused by that mask, giving birth to DIO, a metrosexual vampire who after being defeated by his brother Jonathan with a power called Hammon which is a strange martial art whose power is to channel the power of the sun through breathing and as a final act of revenge decided to steal his brother's body and use it as his own hiding inside a double-bottomed coffin in which were also his wife and her descendant who miraculously survived the accident of the ship in which they were traveling caused by DIO, to finally be defeated in 1992 in Egypt by kujo jotaro the grandson of Joseph joestar who in turn is also the grandson of Jonathan joestar because DIO somehow discovered the existence of the stands and decided to use the arrow to obtain them by awakening the stand abilities of the entire family lineage of the same but unfortunately jotaro's mother did not possess the suffering willpower to possess a stand and fell seriously ill and the only way for her to be saved was by killing him, then tell me about dio's plan in which he was to restart the world with a stand with that ability for unknown reasons, using a father of a black church called puchi who was arrested by your grandparents along with your great-great-grandfather jotaro an ex-convict named Hermes, a child born in a prison called emporium, DIO's son who had with Jonathan's body who is a mafia boss who carries a stand “Requiem with the ability to nullify any stand and a kind of plankton hive mind stand called Foo Fighter (FF) in a prison called Green Dolphin in 2011 and after that incident the Speedwagon Foundation decided to be an organization that seeks to know about all the stands that exist to prevent another incident with that one from happening, am I okay?” The Skalgan said in a tone that mixed boredom and shock in equal proportions.

“Er... yeah, that’s basically it.” I said with a bit of discomfort while taking a sip of the String Fruit tea.

“Ok, for starters what the fuck? This story is the most bizarre thing I’ve heard in a long time, two, this sounds a lot like some kind of shadow caste and three, does the UN know about this?” He said in a tone that seemed like some kind of interrogation.",1,1736555955.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False

1hyjmbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1hyjmbu/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

We have two young children and currently live in the Bay Area. We will be retired so access to employers doesn't matter but great public schools do. There are many things we love about our current neighborhood. There’s a strong sense of community—families are always at the neighborhood park, there are tons of happy leashed dogs, people take pride in their homes and decorate for the holidays (which is a lot of fun for us), and there are community events a few times a year. We’re also close to many amenities—an airport, hiking trails, museums, children's activities, amazing food, really nice malls, redwoods, and the beach. Oh, and the WEATHER. It can get hot in the summer, but the rest of the year is bliss.

However, the Bay Area is competitive, PG&E is notoriously unreliable and out of control $$$, and the area surrounding our specific neighborhood has deteriorated significantly. There’s open drug use, numerous encampments with tons of trash, and people visibly unwell. Our grocery stores now have many items locked up, and cars are frequently broken into.

Because we will be retiring we can't stay here because we need to take the equity from our current home and buy elsewhere for under $1MM to make the math work. But also..a slower pace of life would be great. We'd love to size up to a 2k sq ft home, but we'll be fine with less.

Things that are important to us:

* Safe and clean, kids can safely walk to parts of the neighborhood
* Wonderful schools — coming from CA higher ed in state prices are pretty standardized, is there anything we should consider when moving for our children’s college education and costs if out of CA?
* A strong sense of community that isn’t tied to religion, we will be involved community members/have time to volunteer
* Low risk of natural disaster, good air quality
* Easy access to medical care
* Kid friendly! 
* Value is all relative coming from the Bay Area, but good value for a great neighborhood
* Close to nature— we like to hike and be outdoors. We would like to kayak or paddle board but no big if there isn’t water to do this on, we’ll live. A good few trails are a must though.
* Food choices that aren’t just chains, an Asian grocer relatively close by (within an hour?)

Ideally:

* State healthcare subsidies (CA, CO, CT, MD, MA, NJ, NM, NY, VT, WA), who knows what will happen with ACA though
* Four seasons, not a super hot and muggy place. I don’t love bugs, and our area has virtually none. So…if you know the status of the bugs in an area suggested I’d be curious lol
* Within an hour or two of an airport, flights direct to London and SF would be helpful to get to family (family is in SF and Europe)
* Lots of trees, cozy vibes would be awesome
* I don’t mind if we live in a cookie cutter neighborhood, but I’d love there to be easy access to a small downtown area with some character (not like..the intersection got a Target and they're calling it downtown), good spots to have a cup of coffee and a chat, not just strip malls and blah
* Blue or purple area would be nice

So I (24f) met a guy (23m, let’s call him Craig) on Bumble and immediately he asked me out on a date. We went out for coffee on Sunday and talked for hours and hours. It was absolutely incredible. The conversation flowed effortlessly and he is everything that I’ve been looking for in a partner and there was an instant spark. We made plans to go out again this weekend because we both work full time jobs with conflicting times and Sundays are the only day we both have off. 

Over the past week we’ve been talking constantly over text and on the phone. We both agreed that we don’t want to see anyone else and we would like to be exclusive. He ended up asking me to be his girlfriend to which I said yes. However, a lot of my family and some friends think that it is moving too fast and they think that it’s just puppy love and it’ll fizzle out and they don’t see that it’s gonna go anywhere. 

Me and Craig have had extensive conversations about what we want in our relationship. We have been very open and honest about our expectations of the other person. We’ve been open about our past and our trauma, and how we are trying to heal from that it, and we both want to support each other on that journey, in whatever ways we can. He makes me feel safe and understood. Which is saying a lot for me. 

My mom was initially excited and even asked if I could invite him over to her house for dinner so she could meet him this Sunday (what would be our second date. It was fully her idea. We were supposed to do something else entirely) but Craig was excited to meet her and agreed to it.

I told a friend of mine that Craig had asked me to be his girlfriend and that we were exclusive and she somehow let it slip to my mom and now when I talk about him to my mom, she rolls her eyes and says I’m jumping in way too fast and how can we possibly know what we want after only having one date. I kind of brushed it off but then I went on instagram and literally every single reel or post I see is about situationships etc and I’m starting to get worried that everyone is right and that I am rushing into this. 

I don’t know what to do because I really like Craig and he’s amazing and every thing I’ve ever wanted in a partner. He’s smart, respectful, chivalrous, funny, kind, supportive, emotionally self aware, he works hard and he doesn’t respond with just a few words. We write paragraphs back and forth to each other and when we talk on the phone it lasts hours and hours. The conversations actually matter and we have a ton in common. We’ve been honest about any flaws we may have and are very accepting of the each other. We talk about superficial stuff like our day at work or what our favorite movies are (generic beginning of relationship topics) but also deep personal stuff like our traumas with our fathers and what we want in life etc. we’ve both been very open and honest about what we want and expect and we both agreed that we want to build a very strong relationship. He wants to meet my family and I’m going to meet his next weekend. And it’s not like we’re getting married tomorrow etc. We literally just communicated honestly about committing our time and energy exclusively to each other and want to see what the future holds. 

Does it seem like it’s too much too soon or is it “if you know you know”? 

TLDR: People have started making me doubt the relationship I have with a guy I just met and I want to know if we’re moving too fast and this is in fact a situationship that will fizzle out in a few weeks like everyone else says or if it’s the start of a beautiful healthy relationship.",1,1736554915.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1hyjafi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1hyjafi/straight_males_with_straight_female_friends/,"Straight males with straight female friends, please weigh in.","I (41F) am in a relatively new relationship with K (M49). We have been dating for about 7 months, and things have been progressing pretty well. 

Prior to dating K, I was in a relationship with another man for 4 years, and before that relationship, I was married to my daughter’s father for 13 years. 

In those two previous relationships (and plenty of shorter term relationships before that) I have a history of ignoring red flags, and also have a history of pushing away green flags. I am working with my therapist on this, and K and I will be starting couples therapy soon as well, so we have a safe place to process things as they come up. 

But something has come up, and I am having an emotional response, and I am confused about what is normal v. what is my trauma. I’d like help unpacking before K and I meet again tonight to talk. 

I will also be meeting with my therapist on Monday, so I am not unsupported, I just maybe need some more evidence that my trauma is a liar before I potentially push away a good man. 

One of the green flags I was looking for when selecting a partner this time was someone with a strong social network, and someone who has been able to remain cordial or friendly with exes. I got both with K, and it’s challenging me to explore depths of my trauma that I hadn’t been willing to previously. 

K is very open and accepting of all types of people, and it’s important to him to maintain good relationships. I love this about him. And also, I am struggling. Many of his closest friends fall into two categories: sex workers, and his exes.

It has been my consistent experience that men aren’t truly “just friends” with women. This is coming from my limited lens of every man I ever thought was my good friend hitting on me as soon as I became single, and also from the lens of every man I’ve been in a relationship with having cheated on me with the girl I “don’t need to worry about.” 

I know these men aren’t K, and I know I chose those men to keep proving my trauma “right.”

So when I learn he had a lunch or coffee date or planned to go dancing with friends who are also his exes (like exes as recent as right up until we met) I can only thank him for telling me, while feeling like I am letting this man play me right in my face. Of course there is nothing wrong - on paper - with him hanging out with his friends, regardless of how their friendship started, without checking in with me. But I feel deeply unsettled by how frequently I have to swallow my trauma responses when I learn about him spending time with “friends I don’t need to worry about.” 

One of his closest friends, E, he has never dated, but they have lived together and she is an active sex worker and loud advocate of ethical non-monogamy. Sometimes I feel she is disrespectful to monogamous people, looking down on that choice and trying to push people beyond that. 

She recently asked K to star along side her in a music video. He was a sort of mad scientist bringing her - a creature babe - to life in his lab. Her scripting called for K to grope her breasts and body. When he asked me how I felt about it, and I told him I didn’t love it, he had her change the script so that he wasn’t actually touching her during their lap dance scene. She was cold with me for a long time after that. 

Her birthday is coming up, and last night K told me that every year E and K and a small handful of other friends who are also sex workers, go to a hot tub and get naked and get drunk/high and just have deep heartfelt conversations. Only the people who can fit in the hot tub are invited. One of the other women going is someone who acts like she has never met me before everytime we see each other. He asked me how I felt about it. I was pretty triggered, and tried to unpack with him as much as I could, and then woke up today to him telling me he wound just making up an excuse not to go. I told him I didn’t think that would work for the long term - that he would begin to resent me for getting in the way of how he likes to spend time with his friends. He’s coming over tonight so we can talk more in person.

He explained that because he doesn’t see these friends sexually, that this is a neutral event for him, even if I view it as a sexually charged event. That even if they are attracted to him, he isn’t going to sleep with anyone, so it doesn’t matter. 

I personally wouldn’t put myself in a hot tub of 3-4 naked straight male sex workers, get drunk/high and emotionally connect with them. I feel that choice is disrespectful to my monogamous partner. Even if no one is having sex/getting sexy, all of the elements are in place for boundaries to get muddy. 

I am trying to understand my own boundaries here. There is so much nuance to all of this that makes how he chooses to spend his time with his friends “okay” and within the bounds of monogamy, since he isn’t having sex with anyone else. 

But I cannot shake the feeling that I am once again pushing my own boundaries to someone else’s comfort level and will find myself disrespected on the other end of it. 

I cannot shake the feeling that K keeps a roster of women around to keep him feeling wanted and validated. 

And I cannot shake the feeling that I once again will be in the position where I am giving someone full license to cheat on me because I consented to all these other little things. 

I fear this dynamic could pave the way for behavior that feels like betrayal, even if it’s technically “allowed.” 

I KNOW I am insecure, and am actively trying to build a sense of security within myself and this relationship. But also, I don’t know that I want to be “secure” with his choices. 

Please help me see what I’m not seeing, consider what I am not considering.

Ghost stories, haunted houses, cursed objects — they were all just tales to entertain us around campfires or on stormy nights. But I learned, the hard way, that some things are far more terrifying than any story could ever capture.

It started with a box. A plain, unmarked package left on my doorstep one cold November morning. There was no return address, no note, just a neatly wrapped parcel with my name scrawled across it in an elegant but unfamiliar handwriting. At first, I assumed it was a mistake, a package meant for someone else. But curiosity has a way of overriding reason, so I brought it inside, set it on my kitchen table, and peeled back the paper.

Inside was a doll.

Not the cheerful kind you’d see in toy stores or a child’s bedroom. No, this was something entirely different. Its porcelain face was cracked, as though it had been dropped and hastily repaired. Its eyes — glassy, unblinking — were a vivid, unnatural blue that seemed to follow me no matter where I moved. The doll wore a faded Victorian-style dress, tattered at the hem, and clutched a small, threadbare teddy bear in its tiny hands. There was something off about it, something I couldn’t quite place but felt deep in my bones.

I should have thrown it away then and there. But instead, I set it on a shelf in my living room, thinking nothing more of it.

That night, I awoke to the sound of footsteps.

At first, I thought it was the creaking of the old wooden floors in my house. It was an old place, full of quirks and noises that I’d grown used to over the years. But these weren’t the random creaks of settling wood. They were deliberate, rhythmic, moving closer and closer to my bedroom.

I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. Someone was in my house.

I reached for my phone on the nightstand, my fingers trembling as I dialed 911. But before I could hit the call button, the footsteps stopped. Dead silence filled the house. I strained my ears, waiting for any sign of movement, but there was nothing. After what felt like an eternity, I summoned the courage to get out of bed and check the locks. Everything was secure. No sign of a break-in.

I didn’t sleep much that night.

The next morning, I noticed something strange. The doll wasn’t on the shelf where I’d left it. Instead, it was sitting on my coffee table, its unblinking eyes staring directly at me. A chill ran down my spine. I tried to convince myself that I must have moved it and forgotten, but deep down, I knew better. Still, I placed it back on the shelf and went about my day, trying to shake off the unease that clung to me like a second skin.

But the footsteps returned that night. Louder this time, accompanied by faint whispers that I couldn’t quite make out. I stayed in bed, clutching the covers like a lifeline, my mind racing with every worst-case scenario. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The house fell silent once more.

When I ventured into the living room the next morning, the doll was on the floor, its head turned to face the doorway as though it had been waiting for me. My stomach churned, a sickening wave of dread washing over me. This wasn’t

I decided to get rid of it.

I threw the doll into a box, taped it shut, and drove to the nearest thrift store. The clerk gave me a strange look as I handed it over, but I didn’t care. I just wanted it gone. For the first time in days, I felt a sense of relief, as though a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.

That night, I slept peacefully. No footsteps. No whispers. Just silence.

But the peace didn’t last.

The next morning, the doll was back. Sitting on my kitchen table, its glassy eyes fixed on mine. My breath caught in my throat, and I stumbled backward, nearly knocking over a chair. This couldn’t be happening. It wasn’t possible.

I grabbed the doll and drove to the edge of town, where an old quarry had been turned into a landfill. I hurled the doll as far as I could, watching as it disappeared into the sea of trash below. This time, I was sure it was gone for good.

Or so I thought.

When I returned home, the doll was waiting for me on the front porch.

The doll had crossed a line now. It wasn’t just an eerie object; it was something far worse, something malevolent. I stared at it, my hands trembling as I unlocked the front door. I thought about leaving it out there, abandoning the house altogether, but where would I go? This was my home.

I picked it up with shaking hands and brought it inside, though every fiber of my being screamed not to. I needed to understand what I was dealing with. There had to be a logical explanation. Or so I told myself.

I set the doll on the table and examined it closely. The cracks in its porcelain face seemed deeper, darker, almost like veins spreading beneath its surface. Its dress looked more tattered than before, and the teddy bear in its hands was now missing an eye. But the most unsettling change was its eyes. They weren’t just unblinking anymore. They were alive, shimmering faintly in the dim light, as though something was looking out from within.

I decided to research the doll’s origin. It had to come from somewhere, right? I took photos of it and uploaded them to a few online forums dedicated to antique dolls and paranormal oddities. Within hours, the responses started pouring in. Most were generic, guesses about its age or style. But one message stood out.

It came from a user with no profile picture and a username that was just a random string of numbers. The message read: ""Get rid of it. Burn it if you can. Do not keep it in your home. It’s not just a doll.""

My stomach churned as I read the words. I replied, asking what they meant, but the user never responded. The message haunted me all day, a seed of fear that grew with every passing hour.

That night, the whispers returned, louder and more distinct. I couldn’t understand the words, but they were undeniably there, circling through the house like a malevolent wind. And then came the laughter — soft, childlike, but twisted in a way that made my skin crawl. It was coming from the living room.

I grabbed a flashlight and crept down the hallway, my heart pounding so loudly I thought it might burst. The light flickered as I entered the room, casting eerie shadows on the walls. The doll was no longer on the table. It was sitting in my armchair, its head tilted slightly, as if it were smiling at me.

My breath caught, and I dropped the flashlight. The room plunged into darkness, and the whispers grew louder, more insistent. I stumbled backward, fumbling for the light switch, but when I finally turned it on, the doll was gone.

The room was empty.

I searched the entire house, every closet, every corner, but it had vanished. Yet I could still feel its presence, like a weight pressing down on me, suffocating and inescapable. I locked myself in my bedroom and stayed awake until dawn, clutching a knife for protection.

The next morning, I found the doll in my bed.

I was unraveling. My mind felt like it was fraying at the edges, each thread pulled loose by the presence of that cursed doll. Every logical thought I clung to had been shredded by the impossible. It wasn’t just my sanity at stake anymore; it felt like my very soul was under siege.

The doll wasn’t inanimate. It wasn’t just a creepy relic with a mysterious origin. It was alive in some way I couldn’t comprehend, and worse, it wanted something from me.

I spent the morning scouring the internet for anything that might help. Stories of haunted dolls weren’t exactly in short supply, but most were urban legends or thinly veiled horror fiction. None of them offered solutions, just warnings to stay away. But I couldn’t stay away; it was too late for that. The doll had already chosen me.

One post caught my eye. It was buried deep in a forum for occult enthusiasts. The user claimed to have encountered a similar doll, one that seemed to move on its own and torment its owner. They mentioned a ritual, a way to banish whatever entity was tied to the object. It was risky, they said, and not guaranteed to work, but it was the only lead I had.

The ritual required salt, candles, and something that bound me to the doll — in this case, the box it had arrived in. I would need to surround the doll with a circle of salt, light the candles at each cardinal point, and chant a specific incantation while focusing all my intent on severing the connection between me and the entity.

It sounded absurd. But absurdity had become my reality.

That night, I prepared for the ritual. I placed the doll in the center of my living room, surrounded it with a thick ring of salt, and positioned the candles as instructed. The doll’s eyes seemed to gleam in the flickering candlelight, as though it knew what I was attempting. I took a deep breath, clutching the box it had arrived in, and began to chant.

At first, nothing happened. The room was eerily silent, the only sound my own shaky voice repeating the incantation. But then the air grew heavy, thick with a presence that made my skin crawl. The flames of the candles flickered violently, casting distorted shadows on the walls. The whispers returned, louder than ever, overlapping and chaotic, filling my head with an unbearable cacophony.

And then, the doll moved.

Its head turned slowly, deliberately, until it was facing me. My voice faltered, the chant dying in my throat as I stared in horror. The whispers coalesced into a single voice — deep, guttural, and inhuman. ""You cannot escape me,"" it said. ""You invited me in.""

The candles extinguished all at once, plunging the room into darkness. I scrambled backward, clutching the box like a shield. The air was electric, charged with a malevolence that made it hard to breathe. I fumbled for the flashlight I’d left on the floor, my fingers trembling so badly I could barely hold it. When I finally managed to switch it on, the doll was gone.

But I wasn’t alone.

The shadows in the room seemed to shift, coalescing into a form that was both amorphous and distinctly humanoid. It towered over me, its presence oppressive and overwhelming. The voice came again, this time from everywhere and nowhere. ""You belong to me now.""

Reality itself seemed to ripple, the edges of the room dissolving into darkness. I tried to move, to scream, but my body refused to obey. The entity loomed closer, and for the first time, I saw its face — or rather, the absence of one. It was a void, a swirling chasm of nothingness that pulled at my very essence.

The doll appeared at its feet, its glassy eyes now glowing with a malevolent light. The entity reached out, its shadowy hand closing around me, and the world shattered.

I woke up to the sound of a doorbell.

Disoriented, I stumbled to the front door and found a plain, unmarked package waiting for me. My name was scrawled across it in elegant, unfamiliar handwriting.

Your heart swoons, you have a few months+ of bliss, then you're left with stress, anger, unmatchable sadness, etc. It legitimately is like a drug. You get a high for a bit, move from honeymooning to building a relationship, then come down off the high, leave the relationship, then look for that high again.

But, even with all of my cynicism and active resistance/avoidance of the notion, I still have a lonely man's romantic heart from time to time. Seeing a woman stare dreamily into a man's eyes and feel my heart ache. See couples cuddling on social media and suddenly feel cold. Today at work I saw a cupple nuzzling as they shared a coffee and felt my customary disgust, but, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't followed by a feeling of emptiness.",2,1736554579.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

This is a table for a friend and we will be working together with not much experience between us both but would love to take our time to make it right. She liked the idea of making the top a pop up (pictured in photos). Is there something I should be worried about with that approach?

I don’t like the term no contact, let’s instead call it, dignity preservation and respecting your ex’s boundaries. As a result I feel far more moments of greatness throughout the day, although to be fair even today I experienced two rather intense bursts of anxiety.

…

Now I’m exercising again.

Now I have plans with friends again.

Now I’m eating more regularly again.

Now I have stopped drinking coffee and replaced it with green tea.

Now I no longer consume alcohol.

The necklace that I decided to buy as a gift for my ex, I instead now wear myself, and when we meet, if she notices it, I may pass it on to her. Not to win her back, but as a thanks to them for their time and for putting up with me.

Healing is possible.

No contact is taking the higher road, respecting yourself and your ex.

You’ll have a chance to tell them in person what you wanted to say, just wait it out until you’re calm and arrange for it. Then when you meet, all the things you’ve been delaying will have crystallised, and the message will have an impact that will likely make your ex think … omfg what have I done, why did I break up with them … and you will think … do I want them back? They haven’t really improved at all … or maybe they have. Either way. Doing no contact right means that you will much much more quickly become comfortable in your own skin again, but of course you will miss them and of course they will be in your heart … there just won’t be that anxiety, that despair. 

Stay strong.

You will love yourself for sticking it through.

Remember, no contact doesn’t mean that you don’t respond to their texts, it just means you wait for them to reach out to you, and when you respond to them, you dont write a novel, you respond in a way that matches the wavelength they are at.

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Bread**: Well, now that I'm kind of an expert in fresh pour-over coffee, I've somehow stumbled onto sourdough. I obtained a 220 starter from San Francisco named Doughlene and am raising her child Doughrothy. I've managed to keep her alive (I'm really good at taking care of stuff!) so far and have made various flatbreads. Maybe I'll try an actual loaf soon...

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

1hyj1gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hyj1gv/was_she_being_groomed_is_this_type_of_marriage/,Was she being groomed? Is this type of marriage healthy? Why would a man in his 30s go out with someone that's 19/20 years old? ,"Can I ask you a question, why older men (mid 30s) want someone 10-15 years younger than them. Let me tell you a story about my cousin which i dont understand. She was 20 when she got married  to a guy 14 years older. They went out on 4 dates before they got engaged.  My cousin was 20 when she got married to a guy 14 years older. He didnt let her work, saying that she shouldn't worry and he'll take care of the bills. That's control to me as if she worked, made her own money, she would realise wtf am i doing with someone like him, that she had her whole World Infront of her. 

She did mention to me that she made the biggest mistake and she regrets rushing into it. It's too late now, they have been together 20 years and have 3 kids. She still thinks to herself, wtf was she doing and basically telling everyone to not rush it like the way she did. She was an immature stupid kid who had tantrums when she didn't get her way. She find him at a club and he opened up a whole new world to her, he had car, took her to places she's never been before, he was her way out and she took it. He was bouncing from job to job and gambling his whole paycheck away, she still stayed with him. I was talking to my mum about it thinking why in the world would someone like her who had her whole life ahead of her, only 20 years old settle for someone who had nothing, gambling his whole paycheck and putting pressure on her to have kids. He full yelled at her that she's expected to stay at home and take care of the kids, she just went with whatever he said/wants. 

Do you think that's a bit of control, he wanted to contain her at home. If the went out and experienced the world, she would 110% think yo herself, why the fuck am I wasting my time with him. 20 years later, she's running around taking kids to school, extracurricular activities, cooking, cleaning while his just staying at home laying on her sofa. Her own mother was complaining how she puts all the pressure on herself while her husband just lays on the sofa and she does everything. My aunty steps in and says that if that's how it was from the beginning and she tolerated it for 20 years, it's wayyyyy too late now and she can't change it. He manipulated her so much and she was took dumb to realise, it's only now 20 years later she realised that she fucked up badddddd. I'm just thinking about my cousin, she tolerated this man for 20 years. 

My cousin has always been immature, she still is now at the age of 41. Her husband who's like mid 50s now always gives advice about what to do and she's like yeah, I agree with everything he says. I think to myself im YEARS younger than him, and I have the same thoughts. That my cousin is super naive and immature hence why her husband manipulated her for sooooo many years. When they started dating, he would get her to stop talking to her friends and only hang out with HIS friends, isn't that control? When she was 20 and in her 20s, he would take her out and only hang with his mates, do what he wanted to do. I remember them going out and he'll decide where they go and what they do, she'll just go along with it. He would tell her not to worry about money, that'll he'll cover the bills, she should just stay at home at look after the kids and household, isn't that control?. Isn't that all RED FLAGS 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩. How was she soooooo dumb to not realise all of this.

 My cousin was 20 who had her whole life ahead of her, he was in his mid 30s who had his 20s to go out travel, live his life etc. Why in the world would someone so young want to go with someone who's heaps older, jumping from job to job, gambling his whole paycheck away. Like whyyyyyyy. He was good with words and took her to places she's never been before, he had a car and would drive her anywhere she wanted to go, basically did anything for her to fall for her and it worked. If she had abit of confidence in herself, she would say I want to work etc. That'll scare the shit out of him, that's why he wanted her contained within the household. If she did work, she would have thought why the fuck am I wasting my time with him when I have the whole world at my hands, I'm young , why am I wasting my time on him when I can get someone better. I feel like he took her youth and she was too dumb to realise it. She probably does realise it now and now it's too late. I also found it funny how she mentions that she's the ""boss"" in the marriage, ohh hunni, he has manipulated you, taken you for a ride and you just now realised it. 

Ohh, now this is funny. My cousin and her husband have been together for 20 years. They made a joint email account, bank account etc. In these 20 years, he still doesn't know the password. He was like to his boss, I'm gonna have to call my wife for the password to log into his email. My cousin thought it was cute that he relies on her. I was like wtf, in 20 years he couldn't remember the password, he couldn't have written it down on his phone. His soooo dependent on her. Good forbid something happens on her, how would be take care of the kids, how would he do anything, be would struggle bad. But then again, my cousin thinks that's cute 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦. My cousin was and is sooo dumb. Like she thinks it's cute that her husband of 20 years doesn't know simple things such as a password and had to rely on her. That's cute, like wtf is wrong with her 😳😳😳😳😳. 

She's sooooooooooooooo stupid in all levels. She does everything, I mean everything and she says that she's the boss. Like honestly,his taking advantage of you but you're too dumb to realise it. So her upbringing was difficult, she came to Australia when she was 18 due to war happening overseas. Her mum, dad and her came over for a better life.  She had a boyfriend that she wanted to go back to but obviously couldn't ad it was unsafe due to war. She gave her mum soooooo much shit and my mum's friend said that she needs to leave the house and get out. My mum's friend asked her niece's to take her out. They went clubbing, she met her loser husband. He provided and gave her everything she never had. He knew what to say to suck her in,had a car would drive her to the city, basically opened up a new world that she's never experienced before. After 4 dates, he proposed and she says yes. She cut all her friends out of her life, well he basically made her and she started hanging out with his friends. They got married, for their honeymoon, she back overseas to break up with that guy. So she was married to this old man and still had that boyfriend,had to break up with him, how fucked is that. 

When she got married to this old man, she eventually settled down, stopped the slamming doors, the calling her mum names etc. He calmed her down. When it was my brother's 21st birthday, she stated that she was already married at that age, was shaking her head and said that she regretted doing it. But then she goes ""when you know, you know"", I'm sorry but you're 21, you don't know shit. She's 42 now, still immature, like how bad was she before? From what I've heard, she was the biggest pain.She rushed into it. Hence why her husband was like to her, that he'll work and she'll stay home and look after kids,to trap her in. Because he knew that if she went out and experienced life, she'll know that she fucked up and she'll realise that wtf am I doing? That she's 21, has her whole life ahead of her and why the fuck is she wasting her time with him, who gambles. He trapped her, she was 23 when she had her first kid and the rest is history, too late and her youth was wasted. Now she's finally working 3 days. She has no confidence whatsoever, she's all about image, very materialistic. She needs to show the world what she had. Like one instance she met my mum at the ships and my mum asked a simple question, how are you and the conversation went on how she brought a new car, paid $70K for it etc. My mum's like I never asked anything about your car. She's one of those that brags about what she has. Another story, she got a coffee table imported from Italy, her son was only 6 years old at the time and he left finger prints on the table, she full yelled and screamed at him. Like cares more about the coffee table then her son, like how fucked is that!!! Yeah I can't believe she thinks she's the boss, I think he's lead her to believe that. She thinks she's the boss do runs around doing everything to prove herself while he just sits at home. 

Listen to this story, she was cooking stew on the stove. She told her useless husband to keep an eye on it as she had to go pick up the kids from karate. The kitchen is within  distance from the living room, he fell asleep and the sew burnt. Like honestly, and she's still with him. Like how dumb can she be. I would of dropped his arse early on and found myself a real man. But she still continues to be with him, because his lead her to believe that she's the boss 😂😂. Now what do you think of all this i mentioned? She thinks she's above everyone. Her husband had no money , nothing. The only reason she could buy a house, have furniture imported from Italy was because her father was injuried at work and got a hugeeeeeeeeee payout. My cousins husband is lucky that he has her that runs laps doing everything while he just sits on the sofa and the fact that my cousin's dad basically paid for their house. He didnt have to do anything. I know, I couldn't believe it, he fell asleep and the food got burnt and age was like, why couldn't you watch it. Like I would of lost my shit. I also hate how materialistic she is, before she got the huge payout, she was the most humble person. Now because she has money, she thinks she's above everyone. One time, she walks past me and knocked me with her Michael Kors bag and she was smirking about. It's soooo obvious she wanted to me know what she has. She's done that to multiple people. 

Ohhhh, you know what's funny she says ""when you know, you know"" in terms of finding your signify other. She says that then 5 mins later she states that she regrets getting married young 😂😂😂. Her heart is 100% with the guy she left overseas. When she came here, she was immature, having tantrums, slamming doors, list goes on. The old man calmed her down and did everything she wanted. That was to suck her in, 4 dates later and engaged. She wasn't even 21 when she got married to him. She fucked up bad and realises it but doesn't want to admit.  Like listen to this, they went on holidays to Europe and he yells that they'll never go again. She has absolute no input in anything, it's his way or the highway and she clams to be the ""boss"" in the relationship. Like honestly, wake up to yourself, how dumb and naive can she be 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦. How can she not understand that she was groomed?. She always sticks up for him when things go wrong, saying she's always to blame. Don't understand why she sticks up for him. How can she not know that she's been controlled from a young age?. Why does she think this relationship is normal. Her own mum sees what the relationship is like, that it's not fair as my cousin is doing everything while her partner just sits there. My cousin sticks up for him saying that it's all her fault. 

Why she sticking up for some manchild, no wonder no woman wanted him hence why he had to go for someone who was only 20, who was rebelling against her parents, who had no money, no job, no career. He saw the young girl who's troubled and manipulated her, took her out, sucked her in and she was too naive to believe it all. Is she that gulliable or she knows but pretends that everything is okay. My cousin thinks this type of relationship is normal because its all that she's experienced, she's always covering up for him, saying its always her fault when its not. 

My cousin went to the airport to pick up her parents, he told her that he had to go with her. The flight was delayed and by the time her parents got their luggage, it was a couple hours then expected, but you can't control international plane flights. He was so angry, didn't want to talk to her, he was pissed as he wanted to sleep and it was late at night. My cousin could of gone alone but he pressured her that he had to be there. They dropped her parents off, didn't even help getting the luggage of the car etc. My cousin just goes with what ever he wants. It's such a toxic marriage but she continued to just follow his lead, has no say in anything. My cousins only friends are his friends, his sister in law.

So I pick it up and flick it out the window and go back to making my coffee before I twigged. I went to try and retrieve it, but it had already walked up to one of our resident water dragons and said whatever passes for ""keeeel meeee!"" in cockroachese.

Looked like a generic *Periplaneta*, and this is in the southeast corner of Queensland, Australia.

Get inside and you have to order at the counter before you seat yourself. I find this super annoying and would prefer to have a waiter/waitress take my order.

You order, sit, and they bring food/drink.

What bugs me is that of I run out of a drink I have to get up, go all the way across to the counter, place a drink order, sit back down, and wait until they bring it. All while my food is getting cold.

Burgers here are good btw!

When ordering at the counter you only get a brief chance to look at the menu, order quickly, and at the end you are expected to leave a tip.

Many places like this are opening up around me and it seems to be commonplace.

Does anyone else dislike counter service and would prefer full service at restaurants (obv excluding coffee shops, subway, etc)?",10,1736553962.0,DAE,11,0.86,False

1hyizjs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hyizjs,Weird coffee bed,"Hello!

I picked up a 1-3 cup Chemex, and have just started my journey into pourover! Loving it so far.

I originally used a local espresso blend and got understandably average results, but my recipe seemed spot on. Just over 4 min brew time for 23g in, 16:1, and reasonable tasting coffee.

I then found a Colombian Filter roast which smells amazing, so decided to give it a crack. I’ve tasted this via cupping and was really pleased by the flavour.

The brew time winds up being more like 4 min 30 sec.
I’m using a Hario Slim Mini grinder, a basic kettle pouring in 3-4 pulses, following Hoffman’s Chemex technique (but without the stirring or shaking).

The coffee bed with the specialty coffee appears really muddy and dense. It looked great with the supermarket blend, but I have adjusted my grind ~2 steps finer since given that this is a lighter roast…

The brew tastes reasonably acidic. Not too bitter, but doesn’t have the distinct sweetness it did when cupping. I’d like to make sure I’m not totally butchering something, so would appreciate advice :) ",4,1736553946.0,pourover,12,1.0,False

Determine Your Weight Loss Goals: Are you seeking appetite suppression, fat burning, or energy? Different supplements target different elements of weight loss.  
Consider Your Lifestyle: For example, a highly committed OMAD supplement or even those for fasting might be compared with Leanbean or Trimtone, both much easier to fit into life without many disruptions. Look for All-Natural Ingredients: If one were to take in natural ingredients, that might reduce the chances of any kind of side effect from taking supplements.

The next morning, Eko woke up feeling groggy. *His phone rang and he picked it up to see it was Aldo*. “**What's up?” “What's Up? Malty just destroyed my damn laptop and my love consultation is ruined, that's what's up!”** From somewhere in Aldo's apartment, “**Hey that laptop or whatever that is calls me a bitch! so don't blame it on me!”** *Eko put his face in his palm*. “**You should teach her how to use the laptop” “Whatever but you need to get Malty out of my place and buy me a new laptop!” “Alright, alright calm down let me call Paul real quick”**  
  
After hanging up, Eko quickly called his friend Paul who drove a Toyota Prius. Paul agreed to drive them around, but before Eko left, Aldo made him promise to stay and be the driver. *Eko and Paul headed to Aldo's place in the Toyota Prius*. “**This better be worth it, my Prius battery is almost dead” “Oh great, another guy coming to see me! Maybe they can fight over who gets to keep me!”** Malty said with a big smile. *Malty jumped up onto the back of the sofa, crossing her legs like she was in a pinup poster*.  
  
When they got to Aldo's apartment, the scene was total chaos. Broken laptop pieces everywhere on the carpet. “**Look at this place! She kept throwing things until she found the power cord and yanked it out the window!”** *Malty twirled her hair, clearly proud of herself*. “**At least I got the last word!”** Paul stared at the mess, clearly wondering what he'd gotten himself into. “**Uh, guys? I can take her to buy a new laptop... but after that I'm out. My Prius can only take so much drama”**



Looking at the broken laptop parts scattered across the floor, *Eko steps between Malty and Paul, facing Malty*. “**Okay umm Malty can you please apologize to him for destroying the Laptop?”** Malty stands up from her perch on the couch, looking defiant. “**What if I say no?” “Then you will never gets what you want - fancy foods, a glass of wine and me,”** he says firmly. ***sigh*** Malty crosses her arms. “**Hmph... Fine,”** she pouts. *She turns to Aldo*, putting on her sweetest smile. “**I'm really sorry about your laptop. I just got a bit emotional over my love consultation,”** she says, but there's something fake about her apology.  
  
*Eko takes charge and starts picking up laptop pieces*, while Paul helps collect broken items off the floor. “**There's an electronics store at the Metreon, we can probably get a replacement there**.” *The group moves toward the door*, with Malty walking between Paul and Eko. “**I hope you boys are treating me to lunch after this. I've been dying to try that new Italian place by the theater,”** she says, clearly trying to shift the mood. Aldo is quiet, still mad about his laptop, but starts moving his stuff to make the place less messy.  
  
The short drive to the Metreon is tense, with Malty chattering about restaurants while Aldo stews in the backseat. *The car parks in the underground garage*, and they head toward the main entrance. The bright afternoon sun hits the big glass panels as they step out, and they can hear the distant sound of a movie playing at the cinema above. “**The computer store is this way,”** Paul says, pointing down the hall toward the Target and airsoft store. *A young guy with mullet brown hair in a blue vest waves at them from behind a counter*. “**Oh hey Eko!”** Abraham calls out. His name tag reads 'Abraham - Airsoft Specialist'



“**Abraham! You still working as airsoft specialist?”** *Eko steps closer to the counter where Abraham stands in his blue vest*. “**Yeah just trying to help my crew to get their hings done!” “What crew?” “Kodiak PMC which is my airsoft team who works here”** Paul steps forward with his British accent. “**Oi, mate! Concentrate on the laptop, sorry Abe, but we can talk about this later” “It's fine, take your time** Malty stands at a nearby TV display, staring at the screen showing a beautiful mountain view. “**Look at those hills! The moving pictures are amazing - what do you call this device again?”**  
  
Inside the electronics store, rows of shiny new laptops catch the light. “**Right this way mate”** *Paul leads the group deeper into the store*, passing shelves loaded with phones, tablets, and TVs. Malty keeps stopping to look at different screens showing nature scenes and cat videos, clearly amazed by each one. “**Why is this silly animal playing with wool? So odd but somehow funny”** *She reaches out to touch the screen* when she sees a cat knocking over glasses. Aldo sighs heavily, still upset about his broken laptop.  
  
*Paul grabs a laptop box off a nearby shelf*, showing it to Aldo. “**This one's got good specs for the price,” “Whatever just hurry up and buy it”** Malty has moved on to testing out different smart phone displays. “**Ooh these little ones are like tiny TVs!”** *She picks up a phone, turning it every way*. “**But why are people so interested in tiny moving pictures?” “Maybe we should explain technology after we deal with the laptop situation,”** Paul says, already walking toward the registers with Aldo close behind him.



Inside the electronics store, *Eko walks over to Malty who's still playing with phones*. “**Don't worry, I'll handle Malty so you guys can focus on the laptop.”** *Eko explains to Malty what a phone is*, showing her how to make calls and use apps. Malty gets really excited and wants one of her own. “**Hey Paul, you still have any dollars left?” “Don't worry mate I got you covered,”** Paul says while checking out with the laptop. They buy the laptop and Malty gets a simple phone, and as they leave the store Malty asks “**So can we get a lunch now?”**  
  
“**Sorry Malty but we need to go home now because I need to recharge my Toyota Prius,”** Paul says, which makes Malty pout. In the underground parking garage, *they find a group of thugs smashing Paul's car with bats*. “**Oi! What have you done to my car!”** The biggest thug turns around and grins. “**Looks like we got a party crasher!”** *Eko steps forward*, his fighting spirit pumped up by recent anime episodes. “**Stay back, I know how to deal with them!”** *Eko tries doing the Kamehameha from Dragon Ball*. “**Seriously Eko? Dragon Ball?”**  
  
*The biggest thug grabs Eko by his collar*, clearly annoyed. Paul breaks free and starts using his boxing skills while Aldo tries a shout from Skyrim (Fus Ro Dah) which just makes him sound silly. When neither attack works, Aldo turns to Malty. “**Malty, help us!”** But *she just watches the fight with interest*. The thug points at her with his knife. “**Hey why are you standing there? Fight us!** Malty looks down her nose at him. **Please, I'm far too classy to fight such riffraff.”** The thug gets mad and pulls out a switchblade. “**If you say so... LJ sends her regards!”** Then *Malty springs into action, disarms him with surprising skill and knocks him down*. “**Okay hun, game's over, why is LJ trying to kill me?”**

  


*The thug charges forward with his knife*, but when Malty lifts her hand and fire starts dancing around her fingers, his eyes go wide with fear. “**Yeah that's right wanker! Run along!”** *The thug drops his weapon and runs away fast*, his friends following right after him. *Eko looks at Malty with big eyes* as Malty puts out the flames. “**Well well, my magic finally came back!”** Aldo pushes his glasses up nervously. “**Oh this is not good... Paul's car is damaged and Malty got her power back!” “Eh actually it's not my car, it's my dad's car”** Eko looks at the busted-up Toyota with regret. “**Okay... that's real bad..”**  
  
*They drive to Paul's mansion in uncomfortable silence*, Paul's dad a famous saxophone player. The place has tall gates and a big garden. Inside, a bald man with jazz musician-style clothes stands with crossed arms, looking mad. “**I've been hearing about your little... adventure at the mall. Care to explain this?”** *He points at the car keys in Paul's hand*. “**Not only did you lose track of my car, but you let it get smashed up and now we have to deal with THIS?”** *He gestures at Malty*. “**A former princess from another world or whatever that is who nearly burned down the garage?”**  
  
*Malty steps forward, curtsying nicely*. “**Mr. Dukes, I assure you this was all a misunderstanding”** Paul's dad just rolls his eyes. “**Right, and I'm sure the repair bill will just fix itself too”** *He walks over to the window*, running his hands through his hair. “**I was in the middle of recording my new album and you had ONE job - pick up my car from the airport. Now look at it”** *The group stands there quietly* while the famous saxophone player paces back and forth. His music awards on the wall shine in the afternoon sun.

  
  


While Mr. Dukes is still mad about his car, *he turns to a large calendar hanging on the wall and his face changes*. “**Oh god dammit”** he says, putting his hands on his head. “**I completely forgot about tomorrow's birthday party. I need to get a singer last minute, and everyone good is already booked.You can count on Eko & The Majestic, we also play funky stuff like Patrice Rushen!”** *Mr. Dukes spins around, looking hopeful*. “**Oh really? What song?” “Forget Me Nots, And Malty? She's good at singing.”** Malty's eyes go wide at the mention of her name. “**Good! You're both attending my birthday party. If you mess up, don't blame it on me. My driver will take you home in the limo - it's almost midnight now, you kids need to get some sleep.”**  
  
The next morning, *Malty wakes up in Eko's spare room*. Her clothes from yesterday are laid out neatly - a kind gesture she's not used to. “**At least someone here has proper manners”** she mutters, getting dressed. Downstairs, Eko is eating cereal and watching anime. “**Morning! You okay with singing at the party today?” “I suppose if it means I'm not sleeping on a park bench”** Malty says, pouring herself some coffee. *There's a knock at the door*. It's the limo driver, all in his black suit. “**Well this is fancy”** Malty says, running her hand over the car's leather seats.  
  
*The limo drives through the streets of San Francisco*, passing by Lombard Street as the sun comes up. Inside, Malty is making fun of how the driver has to close his eyes during sharp turns, while Eko tunes his bass. “**I've never seen this part of the world before”** Malty says, looking out at the Golden Gate Bridge. “**Yeah it's pretty cool - hey, we should do some singing practice”** *Eko starts playing a simple funky basslines*. Malty raises her eyebrow but starts humming along. “**You know, I could get used to traveling in style like this”** she says with a small smile. “**Just wait until we get to the gig”** Eko says, noticing how the bridge is getting closer. They're almost there.

  
  


Back at Paul's mansion, *Aldo is on his laptop talking to someone named Roy*. The tension in Aldo's voice is clear even from across the room. “**This is all your fault, you broke up LJ and I and now look what's happening!”** Aldo shakes his head, not having time for Roy's drama. “**What- are you blaming me for breaking up with your girl? But that's what you want right?”** Roy's voice gets louder through the laptop. “**YES! BUT IT WAS A MISTAKE, now hear me loud and clear do not let Malty go to his dad birthday because LJ's parent is there”** Aldo looks confused. “**What does it have to do with malty and LJ's parent?” “LJ is going to the party too and if she caught Malty in the party she's going to uses her parents bodyguard to do something terrible to her!”** Aldo's face turns white. “**Shit.... let me call Abraham real quick”** *Aldo grabs his phone and calls Abraham, who's getting ready for the gig*.  
  
“**Hey Aldo what's up? You're ready for the gig for Mr Duke party?”** *Abraham is adjusting his drumsticks, unaware of the situation*. “**We need your airsoft crew to dress as Malty's bodyguard. LJ is at the party and if she sees Malty her parents' real bodyguards will hurt her**.” Abraham laughs. “**You need protection from the Kodiak? That costs 5 Snicker bars for us”** *Aldo opens his desk drawer and counts out 5 chocolate bars*. “**Deal! We have a deal”** Abraham smiles, already thinking about his sugar high. “**We'll be there in 10 minutes, looking sharp and dangerous”**  
  
*The limo stops in front of Jim's mansion*. The black SUV pulls up behind them - Abraham's airsoft team looks impressive in their fake security uniforms. *Eko steps out first, bass case in hand*. “**Thanks guys, this is gonna work perfectly”** Malty gets out next, looking stunning in her borrowed dress. “**About time someone showed me proper respect”** *The airsoft team forms a circle around them both*. Abraham nods at Eko. “**We got your back chief, just don't get us shot for real” “Don't worry, our song selection is family-friendly”**

  
  


*Eko looks at the security team with confusion on his face*. “**Who are these guys?”** Abraham steps forward, adjusting his fake military gear. “**These are my trusted Airsoft crews; remember the Kodiak from the airsoft store? They are going to be Malty's bodyguard” “Oooh, bodyguard, what's that?”** Malty's eyes light up, seeing the tactical vests and gear. One of the Kodiak team members walks up, speaking with a thick accent. “**Those are replicas, my darling, not real, but they will protect us from BB guns” “Guys, enough with the Spetsnaz accent!** Abraham says, getting serious. “**Listen Eko, Malty is in danger and you need to be careful about LJ and her parents. Do you know her parents was a lawyer?”**  
  
*Eko shakes his head, still holding his bass case*. “**No but I heard those thugs were hired by LJ”** Abraham leans in close, keeping his voice low. “**That's because her parents has a connection with the mob, Lilah, LJ's Mother was a lawyer for Don Martino so you gotta be careful with her parents” “We have your back, boss”** one of the team members says in his usual accent, making Abraham roll his eyes. *The airsoft team forms a tight circle around Malty and Eko*, their fake guns at the ready as they walk toward the mansion entrance.  
  
*A large man in a dark suit steps forward* from the security team posted at the door. “**Identity verification required for all non-invited personnel”** Abraham quickly produces some fake security passes while his team maintains their formation. *Malty adjusts her dress nervously*, now seeing just how serious this situation might be. “**This better not mess up my performance,”** she says under her breath to Eko. “**Alright, on my mark we go in quick - two by two, keep tight”** *The door guard scrutinizes their fake credentials through magnifying glasses* while more party guests arrive in fancy cars.



*The security team's credentials finally get approved*. “**Hey, you made it!”** Paul walks over to them, looking happy to see Eko again. Paul's father Jim stands nearby talking with the Folger family - Robert, Lilah, and LJ. “**This place is huge,”** Malty says while looking around the grand entry hall with its high ceiling and chandeliers. “**Eyes open, stay sharp team”** Abraham orders his fake security team as they move into position. “**Remember when you first performed at my wedding reception?”** Jim says to Paul's father, who nods fondly. “**That's right, you played That's Amore by Dean Martin”** Lilah chimes in with a warm smile.  
  
*LJ catches Malty looking at her* and quickly makes a hand signal threatening Malty. “**Oh please, like she could do anything,”** Malty scoffs and *sticks her tongue out at LJ*. But Erik catches this exchange and uses hand signals of his own to tell Malty he's watching her and going to end her. “**Hey Eko, let's go warm up in the music room,”** Paul suggests, noticing the rising tension. “**Of course, the studio's all set up downstairs,”** Jim adds, trying to keep things friendly despite the awkward moment. “**Do tell us about that wedding performance,”** Robert says with a fake smile, while LJ continues glaring daggers at Malty.  
  
The air feels heavy with unspoken threats as everyone moves toward the music room. *The fake security team follows close behind*, maintaining their professional appearance. “**We'll have a team posted at both exits,”** Abraham tells his crew under his breath. “**Affirmative boss man”** one replies with another exaggerated accent. *Paul leads the way down the grand staircase* while Malty pretends to admire the crystal chandeliers, but keeps looking back to make sure she's safe. “**At least they hired real entertainment this time,”** she mutters to Eko as they descend.

  
  


*Everyone heads downstairs to check out the equipment in Jim's music studio*. The room is big with old style recording gear from the 70s and 80s, with big mixing boards and microphones that look like they cost a fortune. Paul opens a cabinet full of vinyl records while Abraham admires the vintage equipment. “**Dad always loved keeping the old stuff, said it had more character than digital”** Malty walks up to a fancy looking mic stand but seems lost. “**How do you even turn this thing on?”** *Eko shows her the power button and input jacks*. Abraham gets excited seeing a classic Fender amp in the corner. “**This baby is worth more than my car!”**  
  
*Eko pulls out his phone and shows Malty how to use music apps*. She takes to it quickly, playing a Patrice Rushen song. “**Forget Me Nots? This is nice”** Eko nods, “**I thought you might like this one. Here are the lyrics I wrote out for you”** *He hands her some handwritten sheets of music*. Paul and Abraham chat about gear while Malty starts to sing softly. “**Sending you forget me nots, To help me to remember, Baby please forget me not, I want you to remember”** Her voice fills the room perfectly with the vintage mics. Abraham stops talking to listen. “**Damn girl, you can really sing!”**  
  
The fake security team keeps watching the doors as *Malty keeps practicing Forget Me Nots*. Her voice gets stronger with each run through. Paul finds an old bass guitar and starts jamming along. “**This thing sounds amazing!” “Play that groove again, this place sounds sick”** Even Erik the security guard stops to listen for a moment. “**This song really lets you hit some big notes”** Malty says between verses, her voice echoing nicely in the room. The fake guards tap their feet along with the simple groove they're building.

  
  


After finalizing their set, *the group waits backstage until they get the signal from Paul's dad to perform*. The grand ballroom is packed with well-dressed guests sipping champagne and talking loudly. “**And now, please welcome Eko & The Majestic!”** *Eko leads his band onto the stage with Malty front and center*. *They take their positions - Eko on bass, Aldo at the keyboards, Paul with his sax, and Abraham behind the vintage drum kit*. “**One two three four!”** They launch into Forget Me Nots with *Malty taking center stage, her voice commanding attention*.  
  
“**Those were the times we had, Sharing a joy that we thought would last, Memories of love and affection, Never really was just like a dream, Was it the simple things that made me so crazy about you? Was it your charm or your passion? It's not hard to believe, I love you and I need you so I...”** *Eko matches his bass playing with Malty's strong vocals*. “**Sending you forget me nots, To help me to remember.”** Paul's saxophone weaves through Malty's melody while *Abraham keeps perfect time on drums*. “**Baby please forget me not, I want you to remember”** Aldo's keyboard work adds depth to the classic 80s sound.  
  
The crowd responds enthusiastically, *dancing and swaying to the familiar tune*. Even the stern security guards seem impressed as *Malty works the stage like a seasoned performer*

  
  


*The crowd keeps clapping as the band finishes the chorus*. Jim stands up from his front-row seat, *clapping his hands with pride while Lilah and Robert smile and nod at the performance*. “**That's amazing! Never heard it played that well!”** *LJ Folger just rolls her eyes and looks bored*. But Malty keeps singing stronger than ever. “**Did we give up too soon Maybe we needed just a little room Wondering how it all happened Maybe we just need a little time Though we did end as friends Given the chance we could love again She'll always love you forever It's not hard to believe I want you and I need you so I...”** *Eko sings backup while playing bass, hitting all the right notes with Malty*. The whole room feels the emotion in their voices.  
  
*The final chorus starts and Malty hits some perfect high notes*. Paul jumps in with his best saxophone solo, making the brass wail while Malty holds those long notes. “**Yeah, like that!”** Abraham keeps the beat steady on drums. “**Da, da da!”** The security team nods along, even the fake ones getting into it. “**Good times we had...”** *The band finishes the song with everyone standing and applauding*. Even LJ has to admit it sounds good.  
  
“**That was incredible! Better than the original recording!”** The guests rush to compliment them as *Eko wipes some sweat from his brow*. Paul comes over to Eko with a big smile. “**We should totally record that version!”** Jim pushes through the crowd to talk to them. “**Kid, that was amazing. Want to play another set?”** Abraham checks his watch - they still have an hour before the security team's cover might blow. “**Boss, we got more songs ready to go.”** Malty basks in the applause while fixing her dress. “**See? Told you we'd rock this place.”**

  
  


As the crowd cheers, *one of Abraham's fake security guards notices Erik and his team of armed bodyguards*. The guard leans into his radio, whispering quickly. “**Boss, boss - multiple Folger's security with knives on their hands. Looks like they're planning something big like Caesar's assassination in Assassin's Creed Origin. One's packing serious heat!”** Abraham responds through his earpiece, “**Distract them and be careful”** The guard responds with a thick fake accent, “**Yes sir! For our Snickers payment...”** *Two security guards march over to Erik's team*, their costumes looking impressive from afar.  
  
**Step away from the concert!** the guard commands. *Erik turns slowly, hands visible*. “**And who are you supposed to be?We're the Kodiak PMC. State your business!”** Erik shrugs calmly. “**We just wanted to see the performance, that's all.”** The guard notices something metallic in Erik's pocket. “**Oh really? Why's the knife?”** he says, pointing at one guard's weapon. “**It's for slicing steaks, that's all,”** the guard replies with a straight face. The Kodiak guard narrows his eyes. “**Oh really, and what are you holding in your pocket, Mr...”**  
  
“**Erik Sotto. Look, you so-called soldiers better get the fuck out of here before things get messy.”** “**You think we're not soldiers?”** *Erik looks over their cheap tactical gear*. “**Yeah, because you're wearing cheap-ass armor plates and carrying airsoft guns while thinking you've been in war!”** The guard responds with a thick Russian accent. “**Pfft, we're all involved in combat! And you? You're just small potatoes.”** Another guard joins in. “**Oh yeah? And what's that?” “Battle of Berlin, 1945. Using only PPSH-41 on veteran difficulty, with thousands of grenades thrown at me. But I survived!”** Erik's expression darkens. “**You play Call of Duty World at War?” “Of course I do! World at War...”** *Before he can finish, Erik lunges forward,* ***crack*** *throwing a powerful punch that connects with the guard's jaw*  
  
*The Kodiak guard stumbles backward*, his fake armor clattering. ***boom*** The guards begin trading punches and kicks. “**Playing pretend soldier ends now!”** *Erik blocks a karate kick, countering with a sweeping leg that takes one guard off his feet*. The fight spreads out onto the dance floor as guests back away, some pulling out phones to record the brawl. Abraham watches the melee from stage, trying to decide if intervention is needed. “**Ooh, this is better entertainment than our performance!”** Malty says while watching the fight. *The remaining Kodiak guards pull out collapsible batons*, but they're clearly outmatched by Erik's combat experience.

  
  


*Abraham rushes back to Eko and the band*, sweat running down his face. “**Crap our cover is blown! Malty do something!”** Malty smiles coldly. ""**Please give me a glass of wine then I'll help them…"" “No time Malty! Just do what he says!”** *Eko grabs a wine glass from a nearby table and fills it from an expensive-looking bottle*. “**No glass of wine, then I won't help your bodyguard.”** *Eko hands over the glass reluctantly*. Malty takes a long sip, her red lips leaving a mark on the crystal. ""**Time for a firestarter,""** she says with a wicked grin. *She waves her hand and red flames burst from her fingertips, setting one of the chandeliers ablaze*. ***whoosh*** *The sprinklers activate automatically*.  
  
*The fire alarm screams through the ballroom as water rains down, making everyone scatter*. ***whoosh*** The remaining Kodiak guards stumble away, their cheap weapons getting wet. “**This is ridiculous!”** she complains, *slipping on the now-wet floor*. “**Everyone follow me - NOW!”** Erik yells. *They run for the main entrance*, leaving behind expensive shoes and purses. *The group sprints across the lawn to a black Escalade waiting by the gates*. “**Where did you get this Escalade?” “From my dad's birthday!”**  
  
*They pile into the SUV - Eko, Malty, the band, and four Kodiak mercenaries*. *Water soaks through Eko's nice clothes as Malty sits next to him, still holding the half-empty wine glass*. “**Malty, that fire alarm thing - you cast real magic in someone's mansion…” “Oh? And here I thought that was part of the plan,”** she says with a smug look. *The driver peels out, tires squealing on wet pavement*. Through the rear window, Eko watches the mansion get smaller, its lights blinking against the dark sky.

this year i met someone i’ll call a(19mtf) and i pretty much instantly got a crush on her. she’s kind of nerdy, really pretty, just my type. we’ve been hanging out a lot lately and we’ve known each other for about 3 months now. for me, crushes are a very much “if it’s not too serious, i can just turn it off” kind of experience. it had been a while since i had a serious crush, and so i let myself develop feelings for her. she flirts with everyone, which is both confusing and entertaining, and for a while i thought she liked my friend until she said she was demiromantic and ace. we get along great, we’re getting really comfortable with each other, and lately i’ve been thinking about asking her out on a date. i really like her and i think i could fall in love with her easily, and im starting to think she might like me. 

the only problem is this last month, i realized i was still kind of in love with my ex(19ftm) who’s also my best friend. we broke up three, almost four years ago and became friends again. we’ve both been in love with each other since relatively when we first met, or whatever that means for 13 year olds, and then dated for a while. when we broke up, it was a loss of feelings on his end. i got over it, i’ve had crushes on other people that didn’t go anywhere, and it was fine. it was about a month ago that i realized i still had feelings; but not in a simple way. we’d only ever interacted when i had a crush on him and when we were dating, and i’ve been struggling with how to act and feel around him since that’s all i know.

i want to specify that my feelings for him arent really feelings the same way it is for anyone else, and it doesn’t impact the way i act or the feelings i have for this girl. he’s not really an issue, just a complication: the same way i feel bad having a crush because my mental health isn’t always the best. 

the real problem is my other friend. we talk on and off, we haven’t been really close since maybe freshman year of hs. i saw her yesterday and we got to taking, maybe the third time since summer, and i said we really should hangout more, and she said i should text her. i’ll call her b(18mtf). i “cracked her egg” when we were younger, we’re both bi, and she admitted she had a crush on me a couple of years ago, a pretty intense one. at the time she had a girlfriend, but they broke up, so now… idk

whenever i’m around her it’s like time doesn’t pass. we could talk forever, and it’s so fun, intellectual but also laid back. i miss hanging out with her so much and i used to have a crush on her, too, but the timelines never matched up. 

me and a are hanging out next weekend, which i’m so excited about, and i was thinking about asking b out for coffee- just coffee, i’m not going to phrase it as a date. but i think she might like me, just a little. 

i feel bad. i’m not polyamorous and i’m not interested in that kind of relationship, and while i like them both i can’t guarantee that if i bet all on one that it’ll work out in my favor. i like them both, so much, but i feel like i’d be leading them on or something if i didn’t make a choice. would it be rude to keep hanging out with both and flirting a little with the intention of going out with whoever will take me, or waiting it out until i decide? is there an obvious answer of who? i feel wonderful when i’m hanging out with either of them, but when i’m alone and i think about the situation i feel like a dick. i just need some advice.

1hyivjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1hyivjo/i_reached_400_hours_today/,I reached 400 hours today!,"Hey all! A couple months ago when I was at 250 hours I posted about my experience living as a new immigrant in Salamanca, Spain. I was feeling very frustrated with my level of Spanish and my lack of speaking practice when I arrived here, but I kept at it, and now I am feeling more confident :) I reached 400 hours today, and I am very happy with my progress.

The first few weeks have been tough, since I had to learn common phrases for daily life, like ordering coffee, going to the supermarket, etc. I sometimes found ways to avoid interacting with people due to fear, but I knew that I had to overcome it and try to practice as much as possible. I started doing speaking classes (with Jose Maria btw!) and that helped a lot in gaining confidence in speaking. Once I ""memorized"" how people say certain things in certain situations, I became more comfortable saying them myself. I encountered a lot of phrases and sentences that I don't think i'll ever hear in Dreaming Spanish, and that motivated me to go outside more often, try to talk to more people and just enjoy.

I pretty much speak full spanish and never switch to english. People also don't try to answer back at me in english which is good. I get a lot of ""Hablas muy bien""s and it really makes my day. I even met some people at a bar who invited me to a local football match. People show their appreciation to me for trying and it's amazing to get that encouragement.

Although I still have a lot of bad days and days where practicing spanish is the last thing I want to do, I am very happy with my current level. I am proud of myself for sticking to a habit for this long and i'm proud of everyone who's grinding up to 1000+ hours with me :) It's a long journey, but I know it's worth it!",4,1736553626.0,dreamingspanish,1,1.0,False

2. I added more food. At lunch I eat 2 boiled eggs, one avocado and cooked veggie as I like hot food in winter. At dinner I eat raw bell pepper, then cooked veggie and protein. Meatballs were today. 
Then I snack on almonds, sometimes cheese but will finish three hours before sleep. 

With all that, yesterday was a hell of stressful day, I had no cravings. Today after work went groceries shopping and purchased broccoli, carrots, and a bag of almonds. Walked by all the cakes, cold meats, chocolate and did not feel anything. And that is Friday night after stressful week!!!

I feel like outie Irving works for and is in support of Lumon. I feel as though he may even be part of the board or hold a high position.

\- he is all about praise kier which people say is just his alleged military background coming through, but It to me felt genuine and real. Like since his outie is pro lumon his innie is too.

\- The lumon documents could be proof that he works for them and this is why he has access to the other employees locations-he's allowed to. Amongst the lumon papers was also an invoice for lumon-I think this is proof that he actively orders things for the business. idk there was also blueprints which he could only get I feel, if he worked there and was trusted with them. Like expanding their operations.

\- Him painting the testing floor with the down arrow could go in two directions-either he's painting what his subconscious is seeing/memory bleed from innie, or he's simply painting things he's probably seen before as an outie/milchick type position. Because if you really think about it, it makes NO sense to me why his innie would see the testing floor. There isn't any inclination that the innies even know that it exists. Idk to me this could make sense. 

\- In the what's for dinner ep where the board actually speaks for the first time and just says ""yes"" I swear it sounds like Irving to me.

\- honestly I feel like the whole military stuff is to point us in the wrong direction to make him seem more victimized like a poor veteran who suffers from ptsd. it feels too rich and predictable and could be a red herring. Whereas he may actually be the oppressor and is literally head of lumon. also his character seems too small to have a huge impact (which I know he already does have a big impact by changing his whole identity when experiencing the beauty of real human emotions through love) but it could be like oh the character we never suspected to be on lumons side bc he was too predictable and a good veteran!

\- someone said this but I also noticed this in the beginning marks sister says like  ""have you seen your therapist the one with the funny mustache"" someone said or he could be a severance therapist/psychologist who works for lumon-this also makes sooo much sense to me as it explains his coffee theory of him trying to induce fatigue at work-he's analyzing himself/his innie self. Seeing if something will happen when he falls asleep at work. Also trying to trigger subconscious memories by playing that song over and over.

\- a theory by someone named KinkoDigby credit to them. they mentioned right before Helena goes on stage Natalie is heard in the background saying """"\[t\]he humble military doctor you may know..."" This could prove that Irving works for Lumon/holds some kind of position there.

I know this is SUCH a dumb stupid theory and I don't even believe it myself trust- its just that on the OFF chance this is right I would forever be mad at myself for not saying it earlier. lol",1,1736553302.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,0,0.67,False

Now, I feel extreme executive dysfunction. Its so difficult for me to do anything, even brushing my teeth or readying a text. My adderall no longer works. Might as well be taking a sugar pill.

How could this happen seemingly overnight? I have a hunch it has somethign to do with Covid. Around that time I remember having some strong hypnic jerks while falling asleep. That lasted for a few days and every since then ive had a tremor. I dont shake at rest, only when activating a muscle. It happens all over my body. Nothing severe but this leads me to believe that I have some kind of neurological issue or brain damage. In addition to that, I seem to have some heart issues (waiting on appointments for this but they are months out). They mentioned it could be POTS related.

Anyway, I read a few posts here with others having similar issues so I figured id see if anyone has suggestions on what to do. I cant take this mental exhaustion any longer.

1hyikgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/altadena/comments/1hyikgm/one_piece_in_the_mosaic_of_tragedies_eaton_fire/,One Piece in the Mosaic of Tragedies (Eaton Fire),"Our family is experiencing two unspeakable losses, which I know are just two pieces in the mosaic of tragedies in Altadena, Pasadena, and LA more generally. In the next day or so, I'll share thoughts on the grief of losing my sister's home. But included below is my account of the loss of Mike and Tamar's home.

\---

My name is Ara Astourian. Tamar is my first cousin and is like a sister to me, and Mike is a very close friend of mine. As we share the grief of everyone affected by the fires, I want to give you a window into the way that this tragedy is affecting Tamar and Mike. 

For the last few years, Mike has been working for an agency that helps nonprofits with marketing and fundraising. On the morning of Tuesday, January 7, Mike got an email stating that the agency was restructuring and that January 7 would be his last day. Totally unexpected. No warning. As he drove to work for the exit interview, we got on the phone and tried to process what was happening. He was at a loss. He was asking a lot of questions, trying to understand why this was happening to him and his family and why it was happening now.

Meanwhile, Tamar, who teaches English and Humanities at Fresno City College and Glendale Community College, was responding to student emails and trying to get some grading done. As she waited for Mike to get back to their home on Alicia Avenue, she decided to take their kids, Emelia (Emi) (10) and Ara (6), to her parents’ house. That would give her and Mike some time and space to cry and talk and plan.

It would be good for the kids too. A temporary shield from reality. Maybe grandpa and grandma would take them to Eaton Canyon, which was just a short walk from their home on Altadena Drive. Maybe they’d make a pit stop at the McDonald’s down the street for some Happy Meals. Mike sent a message in our cousins group chat and shared about the loss of his job with these words: “Hey fam: some wild weather outside and in our Mekredijian household . . . Prayers appreciated.”

When evening came, my wife Lilit and I drove up to the Mekredijians’ home through the powerful wind gusts, hoping to hug them, ask them questions, and listen. We sat down in their living room and asked Mike how he was feeling.

Halfway through his first answer, Tamar got a call from her parents. They said there was a fire in Eaton Canyon and that it was rapidly approaching their home. Mike and I immediately left to pick up the kids from their grandparents’ house.

The bright red glow in the night sky was ominous. Within seconds, we could see flames raging on the face of the San Gabriels. When we reached the fire, the scene was apocalytpic. Chaotic wind. Embers flying everywhere. Toxic air. As I lifted a fallen fence that was blocking our path, Mike got the kids in the car. We raced away. The kids peppered us with anxious questions. They wanted to know if their grandparents’ house was going to burn down. They wanted to know if their house was going to burn down. They wanted to know if we were going to die. We reassured them. We reassured ourselves. “We’re just trying to get away from the ash and smoke. The canyon and the mountain might burn, but the firefighters will fight really hard to defend our homes. We’ve seen fires like this before. We’ve seen winds like this before.” We left it at that.

As we made our way back to the upper reaches of Altadena, Tamar called and told us a neighbor had come banging on the door, saying that they had to evacuate immediately and that she and Lilit had started to pack their things. When we arrived, Mike and Tamar packed frantically, as Lilit and I took the kids to their rooms and told them to pick out their favorite things.

Emi grabbed one of her little brother’s original onesies, but she left behind her one-of-a-kind crafts and drawings, including the drawing she’d recently made of the lady at the museum. Ara grabbed his stuffies and his fire truck, but he left behind his remote control cars, which were hidden from us in the darkness of the backyard. Mike grabbed a watch that his parents had gotten him, but he left behind 20 years of journals, his wedding band, and the custom cufflinks his dad made for Mike’s ordination in 2007. Tamar grabbed the original copy of her Master’s thesis but left behind her book collection and the meticulously arranged storyboard for her next novel.

We brought the Mekredijians to our place several miles to the south, but before we could get the kids to bed, we had to evacuate from our place too. Mike, Tamar, Emi, and Ara found shelter at a hotel in downtown LA with Tamar’s parents and sister.

\---

On Wednesday morning, Lilit and I tried to get to Mike’s house, but we eventually found ourselves surrounded by burning homes and businesses. Dark black smoke was billowing in every direction. We’d come too close to the destruction. There in the chaos, we found Mike driving around in his car, trying to get to his house too. We decided to escape together.

We drove under sagging power lines. We drove by teetering telephone poles. We drove past Emi’s and Ara’s elementary school and saw it being eaten up by flames.

After getting to safety, we heard that our uncle’s garage was burning down and that his home was in danger. So Mike and I used hoses from a neighboring home to try to slow the flames. As we pointed our hoses over the fence between the houses, I saw Mike break down, and I heard him break down. He was confronting something none of us wanted to talk about. If it was too dangerous to make it into their neighborhood, what was happening to their home? What was happening to their car? What was happening to their books and their photos and their countless mementos?

After some firefighters arrived, we got a chance to put down our hoses. We stood in the street with tears in our eyes and scrolled through the hundreds of messages in our phones.Then, suddenly, Mike turned the screen of his phone toward Lilit. What she saw was the icon of a loading file. He said he couldn’t look and asked her to let him know if his house was visible in the photo. But reception was horrible, and the photo was lagging. The moment he turned the phone back toward himself, the photo loaded, and Mike fell to his knees.

He wailed. He bawled. We fell to the asphalt with him and wept bitter tears. Right then, his mom called from New Jersey, and he cried to her in Armenian, “It’s all gone! Everything! It’s gone! It’s done!”No more school. No more job. No more home. It was all gone.

We sat in silence for a long time, watching the flames peel out of our uncle’s work truck.

Mike finally broke the silence. He started talking about his wife and his kids. He said he didn’t want them to see their memories in shambles. He said he didn’t want them to see everything they’d worked for and everything they’d built in ruins.We also heard the things he didn’t say. He didn’t want his kids to go through what he’d gone through. He didn’t want them to be traumatized like he’d been traumatized by the bombs that destroyed his childhood in Lebanon and left undying wounds in his heart, soul, and mind.

\---

On Thursday, we finally got access to Mike and Tamar’s neighborhood. Not a single home was left standing. All we saw, block after block, was smoldering piles of ash and stone, distinguished only by the sizes and shapes of their chimneys.

We got to their address and searched in vain for Mike’s cherished cufflinks. We wept over the unrecognizable remains of the bookshelf that held Tamar’s novels, Mike’s Bible commentaries, and the special journal they’d shared in their early dating days. We grieved for the irreplaceable family photos and handwritten notes.

We found a charred version of the typewriter Mike had given Tamar for their anniversary. We found a blackened coffee “jezveh” that Tamar had inherited from our grandmother. And we found one of Ara’s tiny monster truck toys, its oversized tires melted out of shape. But Mike’s triathlon bike was nowhere to be seen. Emi’s drawings and crafts were gone.

The winds had come, and they’d swept away the Mekredijians’ income, their school, and their every earthly possession.

\---

We don’t know what recovery will look like for Mike, Tamar, Emi, and Ara. We’re praying for hope to bud in their souls, and we’re showering the ground of their hearts with our tears, but there’s no sign of life yet. There’s just utter devastation.

We’re asking for your help. Please pray for a new source of income. Please pray for a peace that surpasses all understanding and a renewal of hope and joy. 

I know we're all experiencing our own tragedies within the larger tragedy, but if anyone who reads this is able and inclined to help the Mekredijians financially, there's a GoFundMe here:

Ghost stories, haunted houses, cursed objects — they were all just tales to entertain us around campfires or on stormy nights. But I learned, the hard way, that some things are far more terrifying than any story could ever capture.

It started with a box. A plain, unmarked package left on my doorstep one cold November morning. There was no return address, no note, just a neatly wrapped parcel with my name scrawled across it in an elegant but unfamiliar handwriting. At first, I assumed it was a mistake, a package meant for someone else. But curiosity has a way of overriding reason, so I brought it inside, set it on my kitchen table, and peeled back the paper.

Inside was a doll.

Not the cheerful kind you’d see in toy stores or a child’s bedroom. No, this was something entirely different. Its porcelain face was cracked, as though it had been dropped and hastily repaired. Its eyes — glassy, unblinking — were a vivid, unnatural blue that seemed to follow me no matter where I moved. The doll wore a faded Victorian-style dress, tattered at the hem, and clutched a small, threadbare teddy bear in its tiny hands. There was something off about it, something I couldn’t quite place but felt deep in my bones.

I should have thrown it away then and there. But instead, I set it on a shelf in my living room, thinking nothing more of it.

That night, I awoke to the sound of footsteps.

At first, I thought it was the creaking of the old wooden floors in my house. It was an old place, full of quirks and noises that I’d grown used to over the years. But these weren’t the random creaks of settling wood. They were deliberate, rhythmic, moving closer and closer to my bedroom.

I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. Someone was in my house.

I reached for my phone on the nightstand, my fingers trembling as I dialed 911. But before I could hit the call button, the footsteps stopped. Dead silence filled the house. I strained my ears, waiting for any sign of movement, but there was nothing. After what felt like an eternity, I summoned the courage to get out of bed and check the locks. Everything was secure. No sign of a break-in.

I didn’t sleep much that night.

The next morning, I noticed something strange. The doll wasn’t on the shelf where I’d left it. Instead, it was sitting on my coffee table, its unblinking eyes staring directly at me. A chill ran down my spine. I tried to convince myself that I must have moved it and forgotten, but deep down, I knew better. Still, I placed it back on the shelf and went about my day, trying to shake off the unease that clung to me like a second skin.

But the footsteps returned that night. Louder this time, accompanied by faint whispers that I couldn’t quite make out. I stayed in bed, clutching the covers like a lifeline, my mind racing with every worst-case scenario. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The house fell silent once more.

When I ventured into the living room the next morning, the doll was on the floor, its head turned to face the doorway as though it had been waiting for me. My stomach churned, a sickening wave of dread washing over me. This wasn’t 

I decided to get rid of it.

I threw the doll into a box, taped it shut, and drove to the nearest thrift store. The clerk gave me a strange look as I handed it over, but I didn’t care. I just wanted it gone. For the first time in days, I felt a sense of relief, as though a weight had been lifted from my shoulders.

That night, I slept peacefully. No footsteps. No whispers. Just silence.

But the peace didn’t last.

The next morning, the doll was back. Sitting on my kitchen table, its glassy eyes fixed on mine. My breath caught in my throat, and I stumbled backward, nearly knocking over a chair. This couldn’t be happening. It wasn’t possible.

I grabbed the doll and drove to the edge of town, where an old quarry had been turned into a landfill. I hurled the doll as far as I could, watching as it disappeared into the sea of trash below. This time, I was sure it was gone for good.

Or so I thought.

When I returned home, the doll was waiting for me on the front porch.

The doll had crossed a line now. It wasn’t just an eerie object; it was something far worse, something malevolent. I stared at it, my hands trembling as I unlocked the front door. I thought about leaving it out there, abandoning the house altogether, but where would I go? This was my home.

I picked it up with shaking hands and brought it inside, though every fiber of my being screamed not to. I needed to understand what I was dealing with. There had to be a logical explanation. Or so I told myself.

I set the doll on the table and examined it closely. The cracks in its porcelain face seemed deeper, darker, almost like veins spreading beneath its surface. Its dress looked more tattered than before, and the teddy bear in its hands was now missing an eye. But the most unsettling change was its eyes. They weren’t just unblinking anymore. They were alive, shimmering faintly in the dim light, as though something was looking out from within.

I decided to research the doll’s origin. It had to come from somewhere, right? I took photos of it and uploaded them to a few online forums dedicated to antique dolls and paranormal oddities. Within hours, the responses started pouring in. Most were generic, guesses about its age or style. But one message stood out.

It came from a user with no profile picture and a username that was just a random string of numbers. The message read: ""Get rid of it. Burn it if you can. Do not keep it in your home. It’s not just a doll.""

My stomach churned as I read the words. I replied, asking what they meant, but the user never responded. The message haunted me all day, a seed of fear that grew with every passing hour.

That night, the whispers returned, louder and more distinct. I couldn’t understand the words, but they were undeniably there, circling through the house like a malevolent wind. And then came the laughter — soft, childlike, but twisted in a way that made my skin crawl. It was coming from the living room.

I grabbed a flashlight and crept down the hallway, my heart pounding so loudly I thought it might burst. The light flickered as I entered the room, casting eerie shadows on the walls. The doll was no longer on the table. It was sitting in my armchair, its head tilted slightly, as if it were smiling at me.

My breath caught, and I dropped the flashlight. The room plunged into darkness, and the whispers grew louder, more insistent. I stumbled backward, fumbling for the light switch, but when I finally turned it on, the doll was gone.

The room was empty.

I searched the entire house, every closet, every corner, but it had vanished. Yet I could still feel its presence, like a weight pressing down on me, suffocating and inescapable. I locked myself in my bedroom and stayed awake until dawn, clutching a knife for protection.

The next morning, I found the doll in my bed.

I was unraveling. My mind felt like it was fraying at the edges, each thread pulled loose by the presence of that cursed doll. Every logical thought I clung to had been shredded by the impossible. It wasn’t just my sanity at stake anymore; it felt like my very soul was under siege.

The doll wasn’t inanimate. It wasn’t just a creepy relic with a mysterious origin. It was alive in some way I couldn’t comprehend, and worse, it wanted something from me.

I spent the morning scouring the internet for anything that might help. Stories of haunted dolls weren’t exactly in short supply, but most were urban legends or thinly veiled horror fiction. None of them offered solutions, just warnings to stay away. But I couldn’t stay away; it was too late for that. The doll had already chosen me.

One post caught my eye. It was buried deep in a forum for occult enthusiasts. The user claimed to have encountered a similar doll, one that seemed to move on its own and torment its owner. They mentioned a ritual, a way to banish whatever entity was tied to the object. It was risky, they said, and not guaranteed to work, but it was the only lead I had.

The ritual required salt, candles, and something that bound me to the doll — in this case, the box it had arrived in. I would need to surround the doll with a circle of salt, light the candles at each cardinal point, and chant a specific incantation while focusing all my intent on severing the connection between me and the entity.

It sounded absurd. But absurdity had become my reality.

That night, I prepared for the ritual. I placed the doll in the center of my living room, surrounded it with a thick ring of salt, and positioned the candles as instructed. The doll’s eyes seemed to gleam in the flickering candlelight, as though it knew what I was attempting. I took a deep breath, clutching the box it had arrived in, and began to chant.

At first, nothing happened. The room was eerily silent, the only sound my own shaky voice repeating the incantation. But then the air grew heavy, thick with a presence that made my skin crawl. The flames of the candles flickered violently, casting distorted shadows on the walls. The whispers returned, louder than ever, overlapping and chaotic, filling my head with an unbearable cacophony.

And then, the doll moved.

Its head turned slowly, deliberately, until it was facing me. My voice faltered, the chant dying in my throat as I stared in horror. The whispers coalesced into a single voice — deep, guttural, and inhuman. ""You cannot escape me,"" it said. ""You invited me in.""

The candles extinguished all at once, plunging the room into darkness. I scrambled backward, clutching the box like a shield. The air was electric, charged with a malevolence that made it hard to breathe. I fumbled for the flashlight I’d left on the floor, my fingers trembling so badly I could barely hold it. When I finally managed to switch it on, the doll was gone.

But I wasn’t alone.

The shadows in the room seemed to shift, coalescing into a form that was both amorphous and distinctly humanoid. It towered over me, its presence oppressive and overwhelming. The voice came again, this time from everywhere and nowhere. ""You belong to me now.""

Reality itself seemed to ripple, the edges of the room dissolving into darkness. I tried to move, to scream, but my body refused to obey. The entity loomed closer, and for the first time, I saw its face — or rather, the absence of one. It was a void, a swirling chasm of nothingness that pulled at my very essence.

The doll appeared at its feet, its glassy eyes now glowing with a malevolent light. The entity reached out, its shadowy hand closing around me, and the world shattered.

I woke up to the sound of a doorbell.

Disoriented, I stumbled to the front door and found a plain, unmarked package waiting for me. My name was scrawled across it in elegant, unfamiliar handwriting.

There have been more than a few problems till we got here, her meth addiction for one, also she took a while to delete her dating app account where she messaged people from time to time, then on our 1st anniversary she was downstairs drugged up texting her best friend saying how she would have sex with him for money so she could but drugs but also cos she missed normal sex, I know this cos I checked her phone at the time due to constant lies about where money was going, then on and off she would have days where she would go on in for several days, police were at the door so where social services at a point promises to change came and went but I dealt with it the best I could.

I was new to family life and did my best to adjust but in the end she ran the household and was frequently upset when I helped or didn't help.

Life went on and I'd do my best to be part of the family, however her drug abuse and the way she texted her friend that time always made me paranoid I went from being anxious if she died in a car crash to being anxious about other things when she was late, meanwhile I simply learned to stop caring. 

Through arguments and more empty promises I left the house for a time and went back only to leave again for this time it was no longer just the drugs but I by going through her phone found she had texted someone else professing her feelings towards him, eventually with the anxiety and inability to let it go I burst out in tears saying I could do this anymore and I didn't want to be there and so I left and I am still at my friends.

Few months gone by and she would still lie to me about not being on drugs, at this point I was no longer going through her phone I could just tell her body changes a lot when she's on it, she and her friend that she messaged about having sex during our 1 year anniversary decided it was a good idea to get matching best friends tattoos, a heart with an infinity symbol that says think and thin, I didn't say anything for it was her body and I knew the way she would tell the story would be that I didn't let her get the tattoo and she would leave out the whys and how comes.

We are now at Christmas eve and we went out her me her tattoo friend and a friend of mine, due to my anxiety I came home earlier and she called me when she got to her house 1h later, then she started always canceling our plans, making excuses left right and center, after a while she asked me if she could ask me something, she asked me if I was going to break up with her again, we had broken up for 1 week before, to which I said no everything is OK, SO! her friend said that my friend said that I said I was gonna break up and that's why she was distant after back and forward with messages she said she hates to not be sure about people and that her friend probably misunderstood, I thought she meant she was unsure about her friend or my friend but I now believe she meant me, because she went on to avoid me for longer.

Coming close to new years I asked if she wanted to come over or do something to which she replied that she was gonna stay in on new years eve with the kids, I was kinda sad but was like ok fair, I called her at 1 point cos I knew she was out and she was at her friends house........bruh.

She went to his house after telling me she was staying home! My heart sank we messaged a bit for 1h or so she asked me if I wanted to come up I said yes there I was she was dismissive of my kisses a few times and dude apologies saying he didn't mean to cause a whole thing.

Few days go by its back at work on Monday I didn't sleep girl is feeling like I'm distant but I really wasn't just tiered as fk and busy playing games to text right way when I'm home, anyway we go out for a bit to eat she ain't got money cos she had a surprise bill so I'm like don't worry I got just enough for both of us, I just wanted to spend more time with her before I went comatose in bed, all goes well she takes me home, I had my friend who's having problems with he's health condition so I had to help him and sit with him for a bit eventually I went up tried to go to my PC but could not focus so I laid in bed for a bit wanting to just watch tik tok but I fell asleep. 

I wake up to her texting me on why I'm being distant and pulling away and stuff like that, I'm really out of it I could tell you left from right and I may not have answered the nicest, might even have used the word dam, she went off mad I got ticked off and blew up in her face about some her ignoring me for 1 week, then I couldn't sleep again back to work with almost no sleep she ain't happy said something about us breaking up, I said OK walked away and proceeded like we broke up like she said, but she didn't mean it, I don't care I'm to stressed and tiered for all that fk it, I leave work put phone on airplane mode sleep so we'll dam.

Next day she even more angry I asked her to explain what happen to me, I still can't make sense of it we don't talk for the rest of the day, I get home she texts, so what is it, i put my phone on airplane mode again cos I don't want to deal with it, eventually she gets my friend to get me to look at my phone, I had a few more texts, stuff like if I don't say anything she's moving with her life, so I go over everything she asks why I'm being nasty and what not and then starts acting like she's worried and have i taken my meds or eaten.

We haven't broken up, we texted some more she went bowling with the kids which made me sad cos all I wanted was to be part of a family and now I'm sitting her sad and alone wondering if it is my fault.

I was not the best at keeping with house chores but at the weekend I'd get up early clean all of downstairs go to shop get her her favourite monster and sometimes also chocolate and when she would wake up I'd make her coffee and chat with her.

I have anxiety problems that she had to work with, ie making phone calls for me or leaving parties earlier. 

Can't think of much else I did.

1hyi8un,https://i.redd.it/lkm8glr849ce1.jpeg,My little fragrance collection,"Hey y'all. Heres my little fragrance collection after about 4 months into the hobby. Its mostly dupes but theres also some designer and niche. 

Time for some brief reviews. I havent had the chance to smell the originals for some of these I'll start with those that i wont buy again. 

Dumont Celerios Epic: my bottle needed marceration badly because when I spray I can smell nothing but alcohol, and i'd go nose blind right away. In the brief time that I can smell it its smell like a stronger version of Khamrah. I blind bought it from all the reviews and its probably my worst buy. 

Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa: same problem as the Dumont, not as bad but i still need at least 2 months of marceration for it to brought out the coffee note. Even then, I struggle to wear it because I'd get nose blinded hard. At least it was very cheap unlike Celerios Epic. 

Khadlaj Island: its alright, but not something i'd buy again. The opening smell good, coconut and pineapple opening are great but the dry down is just mid. The sandalwood is rather uninspiring. I also feel like the juice is not that well blended. 

Afnan Supremacy Not Only Intense: superb fruity smoky opening but the earthy, green mossy dry down is not my vibe. The dry down is better in cool/cold weather where it is smoother but thats about it. 

Now for those that I'd consider to be ""mid"". I'd buy these again but I feel like there could be better ones out there in the same category.

Valentino Uomo Intense: dark, powdery vanilla iris bomb. Its rather linear and i struggle to smell the leather. But its a decent date night/formal event fragrance if you want to smell great yet masculine. Gonna try Mancera Black Noir once this runs out. 

Guerlain L'Homme Ideal EDT : refined aromatic citrus with some almond and leather. Its a good buy. It reminded me of a hot cup of lemonade with some spices. Its very well blended and decent performer. Too bad Mancera Saharian Wind is just straight up better in every regard in the same ballpark. 

Dumont Nitro White: sweet opening with a honey/vanilla dry down. Its creamy, on the bright side and very playful. But at the same time I dont feel like its very well blended. The notes get more intense after letting it marcerate for a while, which is great. 

Dumont Nitro Intense: sour fruity opening into a smoky fruity dry down. Compare to the Aventus Absolu, it lacked the refinement but because of that it is a more playful, intense take. Solid performer all around and you can wear this all seasons

Armaf CDNIM Pure Parfum: this probably needs any introduction. Strong citrusy opening and dry down into Aventus. I can certainly see why ppl think the opening is nasty. I personally have no problem to it. That being said, i think theres probably some better more well rounded dupe out there. 

And lastly, here are some that I'd buy again because its has decent value, good performance and smell. 

Al Haramain Amber Oud Dubai Nights: smoky fruity Aventus style opening but with a sweet, sugary dry down that had many ppl compare to Arabian Tonka. Its actually well blended and perform great out of the gate. 

Armaf The Pride of Armaf: its a surprising one because i dont like it that much but its a great clean, sporty day time scent and a decent dupe of the Sauvage EDT but in EDP form. And it performs out of the gate without any marceration as well. 

French Avenue Liquid Brun: almost a 1 to 1 clone to Althair, in my opinion. One of the few hype beasts that I think worth all the hype. Beautiful opening and drydown, well blended and perform well right away. 

Mancera Saharian Wind: picked out by my girlfriend and honestly it rocked. Aromatic, relatively fresh and spicy opening with a great, classy dry down. It performs very well and outside of winter where it can be a bit weak you can probably use this all year around. 

Now thats my collection, what do you think should I take a look at? I'm thinking of Rayhaan Tiger Cal Cologne Edition, French Avenue Royal Blend, Spectre Wraith, Missoni Parfum Pour Homme and some other niche/designer brand like Mancera Cedrat Boise

Hi everyone,

I’m on my second day of taking 30mg of Elvanse, and I’ve noticed a few things I wanted to check if others have experienced too.

I take my dose at 9 AM, and by late morning (around 11 AM–1 PM), I feel a slight improvement in focus and energy. However, it’s not as noticeable as the energy boost I’d get pre-medication when I’d have a Monster energy drink or a large coffee. That’s fine—I expected some adjustment—but the main issue is the crash I experience later in the day.

By around 3 PM, I feel completely drained: tired, bored, and mentally exhausted. This has happened on both days so far. I’ve been staying hydrated and eating regular meals (even though my appetite has decreased), so I don’t think it’s related to those factors.

I’m also wondering how long the medication should typically last during the day. Is it normal for it to wear off so early in the afternoon? Could the crash be due to the absence of my usual caffeine intake, or is it just part of the adjustment process? I’m also a little concerned that my peak energy levels on Elvanse seem lower than what I used to feel mid-morning before starting it.

Has anyone else experienced this? Did it improve over time as your body adjusted? Was it resolved by a dosage change or switching medication?

I had been on my feet since 4am and every part of my body was weary, but I was happy. The shop was thriving. The number of orders were a testament to that. Now I could take a breath and relax. I climbed the stairs slowly, my legs protesting. When I got to the second floor landing, I noticed a light coming from my husband's office door. I headed toward the room but stopped when I heard a high-pitched giggle.

When she graduated college last spring, I had begged Jonathon to hire her as a paralegal. After some initial reluctance, it seemed to be working out. Alyssa told me how much she appreciated me helping her get the job and that Jon was going out of his way to train her and had taken her under his wing. She was like a little sister to me, I never considered Jonathan would look at her as anything more than that.
My stomach revolted and a wave of nausea ran through me. Not wanting to make a sound I took small inhales through my nose as I grabbed my phone and took a picture. It felt like a cold hand had a grip on my chest. I listened as my husband praised Alyssa telling her how much better she was than me how screwing her was the best part of his days. I quickly used the recorder app on my phone to capture the audio as he described sleeping with her in OUR bed. Unable to handle seeing or hearing anymore I backed away and quietly exited the house.
I don't remember much about the ride to my best friend's place. But here I was sitting on her couch wrapped in our favorite fluffy blankets holding a glass of whiskey while Jen and her husband Aiden listened to me blurt out what I had walked in on. I knew Aiden was ready to storm over and confront the two of them, or at least punch Jon out, but there was something brewing within me.
I wasn't going to roll over and let this crushing grief render me useless. I wasn't going to let those pathetic excuses of humans see a single tear from me. I would cut them out of my life with the precision of a surgeon. They will get nothing from me. I sat up and both Aiden and Jen stopped their commentary waiting patiently.
""I need to let him know I'm not coming home tonight - I'll say I'm too tired to drive so I'm crashing in my office."" I stopped, gnawing on my lip and trying to organize my chaotic thoughts. ""I need to make an appointment to see a lawyer right away - I have to get ahead of this.""
""Aiden? Are any of those apartments still available at your friend's building? I'll need to find a new place and arrange to get all of my things there, I can't spend another minute in that house knowing those two soiled it.""
Aiden whipped his phone out ""Ok I got you Lala, I'm on top of the apartment."" He pecked the top of my head and gave my shoulder a squeeze as he left to make calls in another room.
Jen sat down and grabbed my hand. ""Do you have a lawyer in mind? We can see if they're available to meet us in the morning despite the holiday. Have you thought about calling your mom?"" My heart stuttered at that. My mom loved Jonathan like a son, and she was so happy when we got married.
This was going to hurt everyone. It disgusted me how little consideration they gave to how their actions would affect all of those around them. Everyone's life was changing drastically, and the ball was already rolling. I gave Jen the number for the law office I used when I was opening the bakery. I specifically went to a different firm to avoid any personal conflict with Jonathan's firm. I had never been more grateful. I sent Jonathan a text to say I wouldn't be home tonight and then prepared to call my mom.

I hadn't moved from my spot on Jen and Aiden's couch. The clock over the stove indicated it was past 3am. I wondered what they were doing back at my house, were they in my bed now? Talking about me, laughing behind my back? What were they thinking! What had I done to make them betray me like this? I rubbed my fist over my chest. I loved Alyssa dearly, from as far back as I can remember we were constant companions. I always felt like my relationship with her and Wes were closer to siblings more than cousins.
Was she in love with him? Was he in love with her? Did it matter? Questions pinged around in my skull. I grabbed my ever-full cup of whiskey and drowned it, trying to blur out the images and questions floating around in my head. I thought back to the phone call with my mother and quickly refilled my glass. When I had called earlier, she had answered, her usual excitement and joy in her voice.
""Hello buttercup! How are you doing love? How's Jon?""
I couldn't hide the quick intake of breath, the gut punch of hearing his name. I tried to control any wobble in my voice as I calmly asked my mom if she was alone and if she could talk privately, that I had something I needed to tell her. The last thing I wanted was for my aunt and uncle to get involved - not yet at least.
""I'm home alone. I was just putting some tea on, what's going on? Oh my gosh, are you pregnant? Oh my god!"" I could hear my mother working herself up to an excited frenzy and felt terrible when I cut her off.
""Mother, I am not pregnant, please sit down and let me talk. This is very difficult for me, please just let me get it out."" I heard a chair scraping against tile and my mom spoke into the phone.
""Alright dear you have my attention, please tell me what's going on are you OK? Is Jonathan OK?""
""No mom, I'm not okay. I mean I'm safe - I'm not sick or anything. I just, I don't know how to say this, but Jonathan is having an affair. I walked in on him earlier - he doesn't know I saw but let's just say I saw plenty. I'm at Jen and Aiden's now.""
""He wouldn't! Are you sure? Could you be mistaken?"" My mother stuttered out the questions rapid fire.
""Mom, I am very sure. I have some footage on my phone if you need further evidence, but you need to understand what's going on. He cheated - I am not going to stay with him. There is nothing he could say or do that would make what I just saw and heard OK."" I heard my mom sniffle, and I felt my heart breaking.
""There's more mom, I uh, we know the person he's having an affair with.""
""Who is it? Tell me the name of that hussy - I'll call Susie, and we'll find out everything about her. Why don't you come and stay with me? Why are you at Jen's instead of kicking that prick and his bimbo out?""
""It's not that easy mom, I need you to promise me something before I tell you anymore.""
""There's more? Dear lord, I am going to kill this man, whatever it is I promise, just tell me.""
""I need you to promise not to breathe a word of this to anyone - especially Aunt Suzie and Uncle Charlie. Do you understand?""
""Oh, honey you have nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed about, family is here to support you.""
""Mother, promise me that you will not talk to anyone about this conversation otherwise I will add you to my block list alongside Jonathan and his mistress."" I snapped, it wasn't her fault but my tolerance for any conversation at this point was very small. She gasped and I took that as agreement.
""It's Alyssa, he's sleeping with Alyssa."" I heard her harsh protestation and could picture her wane face, her hand clasped over her mouth.
""I know how much this is going to hurt Suz and Charlie, I just - I can't deal with that yet, or her. I will tell them when I'm ready, I don't want this to ruin the family, but I need some time to get my ducks in a row. I need to figure out what my next move is, and I do not want Jonathan or Alyssa to know what I'm doing. Do you understand now, why I can't come stay with you and why you cannot talk about this with anyone.""
I could hear the tears in my mother's voice when she finally replied. ""Of course, honey, I'm so sorry. I can't believe this, I just - whatever you need I am here for you my strong, beautiful daughter. You will get through this. Anything you need you tell me, and I'm just going to have to be too busy cooking tomorrow to have to interact with your Aunt, or THAT girl. What was she thinking! How could she do this to you? I can't, I just can't even think about it. Oh, my poor child, I love you.""
We cried on the phone together and I promised I would update her soon once I got my head on straight. Next step was to figure out how to get out of going to Thanksgiving with Jonathan's family and keep away from the hapless couple for as long as I could.
I thought of the one person who neither Jonathan or Alyssa would dare cross. My grandmother Dorothy was my only family member from my father's side. She lived two towns over, and I was the closest family member in her life. Grams would help me with an alibi - then I would spend the weekend at the cabin I had rented to try and save my marriage. I would spend the holiday there tearing it apart instead.",1,1736551319.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

i guess 1st: full disclosure. marriage isn't huge for me. commitment, however, is. and some might say marriage the clearest form of that but...in all of our cases...infidelity happens regardless. so. that's my current pessimisms shining through. :)

we have almost been together three years...

been talking about that we are IT for each other pretty much from the beginning...we had some rocky times...i wanted a family, he just wasn't ready to start a family but starting like 5 months ago...we got on the same page and he was and we started talking more seriously about it.

Aside from some rocky moments...our relationship was my favorite.

BUT....three months ago...i found out that he had had multiple emotional affairs and just engaged inappropriately with women. the last one being about 7 months now.

it's been three months. and I just feel so fooled. i'm pretty sure i know everything: no physical infidelity. in his words: he was feeding his own insecurities...being selfish, narcissistic, immature, inconsiderate.

he knows that he ruined our relationship...

he hates that he hurt me. he is trying to show me in all the ways that he knows how...that he cares, that he wants this, that he will never do this again...that he will put our relationship first...etc...

he makes me coffee every morning he does the dishes everyday...in a way he is more considerate, we started going to couples therapy

annnnnnnnnnd...after three months...i am almost over it. here's why:

i don't feel like he actually knows how to be considerate or work through this with me in the way that i need. we are in such a fragile time...and yet he'll still prioritize his hobbies...he will still bring up things that are super triggering for me and then be so surprised when i all the sudden shut down. I'm starting to feel like he actually just doesn't get it, like i don't think it's a matter of how much he loves me or wants to make it work, and at the same time...i feel like if it was as much as he says it is...he would just do the things i need.

admittedly some days are great and then other days, like today, i'm like...this is so fucking stupid. what am i doing trying to salvage this. i don't know when to just like draw the line and say i'm done. And the reason why i don't know when is because i want it to work...but it is so hard...and painful...and comes in waves of rage and then sadness. i guess i'm just tired.

A couple of things you can do:

1) talk to your real friends, in real life. Go for a coffee, play a boardgame, watch a movie - get off social media for a while. Anxiety shared is anxiety halved, and you may help each other.

2) Give yourself a social media detox. Honestly, social media is designed in such a way as to make you click stuff that ilicites a reaction. It will show you stuff that makes you angry, sad, anxious - as long as you keep clicking. Don't give it the satisfaction for a while. Constantly bombarding yourself with negativity is not good for you.

3) Go for a walk! No seriously! Go for a walk. I live in a city near the outskirts, so I can walk into the countryside within 45 minutes, and it really helps me to spend some time in nature. If you don't live near such an area, go to a park, or to your nearest green space. Just get some fresh air. The world still has beauty to see, even at local level.

4) Read a book, play a game, do something to escape the world for a few hours. It's not a long-term fix, but it might help distract your mind.

5) If you're so anxious it affects your ability to function, please seek help. You can either go to your GP who can refer you to various therapies, or you can look up local talking therapy centeres, or even speak to the Samaritans if you need to - they can signpost you to longer term support.

6) Finally, you can be a support for other people as well. If you even make a small difference to someone you know, or someone nearby, you've made life just that little bit better. Be a positive beacon to those around you.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

Even when I sleep well at night ( and since using loop earplugs for sleep and having. Magnesium before bed I’m actually sleeping well ) I get up, go sort out my horse, by the time I’m back from the yard I need 2-3 hours nap. Apparently my boyfriend tried to wake me up at about 7pm today and I growled at him. Is there anything else other than meds that you guys found helpful? Any of the shroom coffees etc? 

Edit: I have blood tests frequently as I’ve had anaemia since being a kid - which was first diagnosed when I started complaining about always being tired as a kid. Iron and b12 supplements never helped. Actually going vegan helped and my iron and b12 levels been in green since. I was hoping asking here I would get different ideas than what the neurotypicals throw my way every time I say I’m always tired and have been for almost 25 years. I always thought that was the way of life, but meds helped me realise that I can go through a day without a nap, but I don’t want to keep taking them purely for this ",1,1736550131.0,adhdwomen,12,0.67,False

1hyhkwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1hyhkwn/cant_seem_to_get_past_the_3month_mark_in_dating/,Can't seem to get past the 3-month mark in dating....,"I (30F) have been dating a coworker (34M) for three months. He is an ER doctor and I am an ER nurse who specializes in forensic exams. At first, things seemed to go really well - he took me on fancy dates, we went to holiday pop-up bars, he held my hand in public, he would get sad if I didn't spend the night, etc.

At first, I was honestly struggling to be attracted to him (he's not really my type physically) but he won me over with how nice he was. I really felt special. I have my own office in our department at work and he would frequently come visit me there. He would bring me coffee and just be super nice.

The beginning of December, I had an emergency surgery on my abdomen. I was out on medical leave for 3 weeks and had to stay with my parents' at their house an hour away. The night that I was in the ER, he was super sweet - he even called me when I was in the waiting room and texted me about my medical care.

He works long shifts, but during that 3-week break, he would text me when he got off work. When I had a week before returning to work (the week of Christmas) he seemed to get more distant. I was always respectful of not texting him when he was at work, but he was in his hometown this week, so I assumed we would be talking more. I was disappointed and texted him something like ""I don't want to be annoying by saying this, but I expected us to talk more now that we both aren't working."" He said something like ""well read any good books lately? watch any good movies? Kinda need something to talk about ya know."" I said I was just wondering where I stood with him and he said ""What do you want me to say."" I said ""It's been 3 months, I was just wondering if this is progressing or if you want it to be a casual thing."" He said he was downtown with friends and we set up a time to talk the next day.

The next day, he called me, and he started off by saying that I don't really ""text with a purpose"" or have a topic in mind when I text him. We started talking about our text conversation and he said he wasn't sure about our long-term compatibility, that we don't have the same values/interests/personality, etc. He started talking about how he likes me and has feelings for me but isn't sure about if we should be in a committed relationship, etc. He said he still wants to see me at work, he still wants to hang out with me, he doesn't know if it could work long-term, all of that. He said ""I really wanted to see you during your surgery leave but understand why you had to go to your parents'."" We ended the conversation deciding to take a break for a week.

Two days later I saw him at work and he stopped me in the hall. He started asking me a bunch of questions and when the conversation was about to end, would ask another, like he didn't want it to end.

I texted him a week later and asked if he wanted to meet up in a no pressure sort of way. He asked about coffee. It ended up that he visited me in my office at work, and we hung out after work. We didn't hook up but he brought me pizza, spent the night, and we cuddled. He told me that during our phone conversation, he had felt pressured, and he said ""I like you and am attracted to you, but maybe not in the same way."" I asked what he meant and he said ""I don't ... love you."" I almost choked on my spit because I had never said anything about ""loving"" him. I told him ""I don't love you either, I just wanted to see where it goes. Do you?"" He said ""yeah, do you?"" I said ""yeah.""

We've texted briefly since then but not much. It's just weird. I feel like I'm a catch: smart, pretty, good job, caring. But I always seem to hit a roadblock at the 3-month mark and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Do any of you feel this way?

If Bitcoin were a movie, Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) would be the action heroes—bold, efficient, and always there when you need them. They’re revolutionizing the way people buy and sell Bitcoin, making crypto accessible to everyone from seasoned traders to first-time dabblers. But even heroes need sidekicks, and that’s where our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** swoops in to save the day.

In this fun romp through the world of Bitcoin ATMs, we’ll explore how these machines work, why QR codes are the unsung heroes of crypto transactions, and how our app is the ultimate tool for anyone diving into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

# Bitcoin ATMs: What Are They and Why Are They Awesome?

Imagine a regular ATM—but instead of spitting out cash, it opens the gateway to the magical land of cryptocurrency. That’s a Bitcoin ATM in a nutshell.

Bitcoin ATMs let you:

1. **Buy Bitcoin** using cash, debit, or credit cards.
2. **Sell Bitcoin** and withdraw fiat currency.
3. **Access crypto markets** without needing a traditional exchange.

These machines are popping up everywhere—from your favorite coffee shop to the local gas station. Why? Because they make crypto easy. No lengthy sign-ups, no waiting for bank approvals, and no complicated exchanges. Just instant Bitcoin magic.

But here’s the twist: To use a Bitcoin ATM, you need a Bitcoin wallet—and your wallet needs a QR code.

# QR Codes: The Secret Sauce of Bitcoin ATMs

If Bitcoin ATMs are the action heroes, QR codes are the clever tech that keeps everything running smoothly. They’re the bridge between the machine and your Bitcoin wallet, ensuring your transactions are swift, secure, and typo-free.

# Why QR Codes Matter

* **Speed:** Scanning a QR code takes seconds, while typing out a wallet address feels like trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded.
* **Accuracy:** One wrong character in a wallet address, and your Bitcoin could disappear into the crypto void. QR codes eliminate that risk.
* **Convenience:** With a QR code, all you need is your phone and a quick scan.

# Enter the Bitcoin QR Code Maker App

Now, let’s talk about the real MVP of this story: our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**. Whether you’re a Bitcoin ATM aficionado or a crypto newbie, our app ensures you’re always prepared for any Bitcoin transaction.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Input Your Wallet Address:** Just copy and paste your Bitcoin wallet address into the app.
2. **Generate Your QR Code:** With one click, your unique QR code is ready to roll.
3. **Customize It:** Add colors, logos, or designs to make your QR code stand out.
4. **Save and Share:** Download your QR code or share it directly from the app.

And just like that, you’ve got the perfect companion for any Bitcoin ATM adventure.

# A Day in the Life of a Bitcoin ATM User (Powered by Our App!)

At the ATM, you insert $100, scan your QR code, and watch as Bitcoin magically appears in your wallet. Coffee and crypto? Yes, please.

# Afternoon: The Bitcoin Gift

Your friend’s birthday is coming up, and you want to gift them something unique. How about Bitcoin? You use our app to generate a QR code for their wallet, head to the ATM, and load up their wallet with a thoughtful Bitcoin surprise.

# Evening: The Bitcoin Sell

It’s date night, and you realize you need some extra cash. No problem. You head back to the Bitcoin ATM, scan your QR code, sell some Bitcoin, and withdraw fiat. Date night saved, thanks to crypto and QR codes!

# Why Bitcoin ATMs and QR Codes Are the Future

Bitcoin ATMs are already transforming the way people access cryptocurrency. But their full potential lies in their partnership with QR codes. Here’s why this duo is unstoppable:

1. **Mass Adoption:** As more people discover Bitcoin, the demand for user-friendly tools will skyrocket. QR codes simplify the process, making crypto accessible to everyone.
2. **Security:** QR codes minimize the risk of human error and ensure every transaction is secure.
3. **Innovation:** From colorful QR codes to NFC-enabled ATMs, the future of Bitcoin ATMs and QR codes is full of exciting possibilities.

# How Our App Stands Out

There are plenty of QR code generators out there, but none quite like ours. Here’s what sets the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** apart:

* **Tailored for Bitcoin:** Unlike generic QR code tools, our app is designed specifically for Bitcoin transactions.
* **Customizable Designs:** Add a personal or professional touch to your QR codes with colors, logos, and more.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** No tech expertise required. Just a few clicks, and you’re ready to go.
