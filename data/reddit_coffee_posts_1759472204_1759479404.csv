Namkeen has long been celebrated as one of the most beloved Indian snacks. Known for its crispy texture, bold flavors, and diverse varieties, [Namkeen](https://bharatnamkeens.com/product-category/namkeen/) continues to be a favorite for people of all ages. From the traditional spirals of Bhakharwadi to the nutty richness of Masala Kaju and the tangy crunch of Corn Chips, Namkeen offers a snacking experience that is both satisfying and versatile. Its enduring popularity is a testament to the unique place it holds in India’s culinary landscape.

# The Variety That Defines Namkeen

One of the most remarkable aspects of Namkeen is its sheer variety. Every region in India has contributed its own flavors and recipes, making Namkeen an essential part of regional cuisine. From Maharashtra’s spicy Bhakharwadi to Gujarat’s crispy Fafda, and from Rajasthan’s flavorful Bikaneri Bhujia to the savory Ratlami Sev of Madhya Pradesh, each type offers a unique taste profile. This diversity ensures that Namkeen is suitable for every occasion, whether it is a festive celebration, a casual tea-time snack, or a treat for guests.

# Namkeen: A Snack for Every Occasion

Namkeen’s appeal lies in its adaptability. It is the perfect companion for tea, providing a crunchy counterpoint to a steaming cup of chai or coffee. During festivals and family gatherings, Namkeen adds flavor and excitement to the dining experience. It is also ideal for travel or office snacks, as packaged Namkeen maintains its freshness and crunch, making it a convenient and portable option. Its versatility ensures that Namkeen is not just a snack but a go-to choice for any moment of indulgence.

# Modern Twists on Traditional Namkeen

While Namkeen has its roots in traditional Indian recipes, modern innovations have expanded its appeal. Today, snack lovers can enjoy baked Namkeen, multigrain varieties, and fusion snacks like Corn Chips with masala or nut-based mixes. These healthier and creative options have allowed Namkeen to evolve, catering to contemporary tastes while still retaining its authentic Indian flavor. The fusion of traditional and modern styles has made Namkeen a snack that resonates with both older generations and younger, trend-conscious consumers.

# Crunch, Flavor, and Satisfaction

What sets Namkeen apart from other snacks is its perfect combination of crunch and flavor. Whether it is the crispiness of Sev, the spiced layers of Bhakharwadi, or the nutty richness of Masala Kaju, Namkeen engages both the palate and the senses. Its bold, savory taste and satisfying texture create an experience that goes beyond mere eating—it becomes a moment of indulgence. This distinctive quality ensures that Namkeen remains an enduring favorite, even in a market flooded with modern snack alternatives.

# Health-Conscious Options

In response to growing awareness of healthy eating, many brands now offer low-oil, baked, and protein-rich Namkeen varieties. Roasted nuts, pulse-based mixtures, and multigrain snacks provide the traditional Namkeen taste while supporting a balanced lifestyle. These health-oriented innovations have further increased the appeal of Namkeen, making it suitable for everyday snacking without compromising on flavor or satisfaction.

# Conclusion

Namkeen is more than a snack; it is a celebration of Indian flavors, textures, and traditions. Its versatility, variety, and rich taste make it a preferred choice for tea-time, festivals, travel, or casual snacking. With modern innovations and health-conscious options, Namkeen continues to delight generations while maintaining its authentic Indian charm. From the crunchy Bhakharwadi to the spicy Sev and beyond, Namkeen stands as a timeless favorite in the world of Indian snacks, proving that a simple snack can hold a special place in culture, memory, and daily life.

1nwstbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nwstbp/am_i_just_exploring_or_am_i_being_reckless_after/,Am I just exploring or am I being reckless after my 8-year relationship?,"Hi everyone, please don’t judge me, I just really need advice and an outside perspective.

I was in a relationship for 8 years (he was also my first boyfriend). We broke up last January because he cheated on me with a coworker. That relationship started when I was 19 and lasted until 27, so basically all my early adult life was spent with him.

After the breakup, I ended up in a short “situationship” with a guy who showered me with gifts and attention, but he ghosted me. That hurt a lot, but I tried to move forward and started exploring dating.

Since then, I’ve been on different dates:

* **Engineer guy:** He said it would just be a quick coffee after work, but he took me sightseeing and to his favorite resto-bar. He was respectful most of the time, but when he dropped me off, he kissed me and grabbed my chest out of nowhere. I felt really disrespected (I was even dressed decently), so I blocked him.
* **Basketball player:** Found me on Threads and said he found me attractive. We were supposed to hang out casually, but things overlapped with another guy (a vocalist) I also met the same day. Long story short, it turned messy — almost a double-booked date situation. I ended up drinking with the basketball guy, and we slept together. Later, I found out he lied about his age and was way younger than me. I ghosted him after because I honestly felt disgusted with myself.
* **The rich TikTok guy:** Grew up in the US, took me to a fine dining restaurant. He was attractive and nice, but I felt intimidated, so I ghosted him too.
* **The “model-looking” IG guy:** Looked great in pictures, but in person he was glued to his phone. We both ended up scrolling instead of connecting. Big turn-off.
* **Ayman (my fave so far):** Cooked for me, helped me move out, seemed genuinely nice. I thought he was boyfriend material, but he ghosted me too.
* **Kenneth (current):** Consistent so far — first a bar date, then coffee, then my place, then Airbnb. He even invited me to a trip, but I declined because I was sick and busy. Still, he continues to put in effort.

Now here’s my realization:  
When I was younger, I only entertained my ex because he seemed genuine. He turned out to be a cheater, so now I don’t waste time. If I see red flags, I block or ghost because I feel like there are always other options. Words don’t make me kilig anymore — I only look at actions and vibes.

Sometimes I wonder though: am I just finally “exploring” because I never dated around in my teens/early 20s, or am I being reckless? Is this really how modern dating works? I feel like I’m trying to figure things out at 27 that other people already learned way earlier.

Would love some advice — especially from people who went through a long-term breakup and had to start over. How do you know if you’re just exploring or if you’re sabotaging yourself?",1,1759477521.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False
1nwssm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1nwssm8/handling_laziness_weight_gain_and_burn_out/,"Handling laziness, weight gain and burn out.","I am so lucky to have a dream remote job, its a senior role in fintech. Its hard work, fast past but I love my job.  Our offices are global, I have teams in 5 locations round the globe. I am also a parent with young kids. I find myself waking up at 6am checking slack right away and sometimes there are meetings very early so I barely have time for a morning coffee or shower before I need to login. I also work late some evenings to catch up with other teams. I then have to wake up in the night occasionally with my kids. I'm pretty burned out.  
I notice the impact on my body, I gained 15kg over the last few years, I eat at my desk fast usually because I'll miss a meeting if I don't. I barely take proper breaks and usually use them to pick up the kids or run an errand. I go to the gym only at the weekend as its the only time I have to go. 

Some days I find myself losing productivity as I have too many things on at the same time I can't think straight or finish anything. Those days I feel lazy, and do the bare minimum on those days. 

I am so thankful this job gives me flexibility, I couldn't imagine being a parent and having to go into the city to work in an office.  I would have to work part time, less income and probably take on a less senior role. 

  
How does everyone do this? I mean I'm sure there is an easy answer here but I can't seem to find it!

I recently joined this subreddit and thought it’s time to share my love story — or more honestly, the love story that broke me. I still wonder if I did something wrong, so I want to know your honest opinion.

At that time, I was 17, still in school, and he was 19, a college student. We were deeply in love — or so I thought. It was a secret relationship. He asked me not to tell anyone, but I didn’t realize that included even my close friends. When I told them, he was a little upset but not mad, so I assumed it was okay.

Later, he had to move to another city for higher studies. We stayed in touch — called, texted, video-called. I’m a shy person, and I didn’t feel comfortable showing my face much because I hadn’t done threading in a long time (it hurts, and I was scared to go to salons). I have joint eyebrows, and I used to feel like I looked like a hairy gorilla. But still, he never complained or said anything rude.

But after some weeks, his texts stopped. He used to message first since he was busy and had said he’d text when free. When four days passed with no messages, I finally texted. He said he was overwhelmed with projects and practicals. I understood — just asked him to send at least a “Good morning” or “Good night” message when he could. He agreed… but didn’t.

For nearly a month, he didn’t text. Out of worry, I searched for his Instagram (he had told me he didn’t have one). I found it.
He had posts of coffee with friends, movie nights, and even a shirtless photo taken by someone else. I was shocked. If he had time for all of that, why not for me?

Out of frustration, I posted a WhatsApp status:
“Are you cheating on me?”

Within 5 minutes, he suddenly had time to text me.
He acted like everything was normal, like nothing had happened. I didn’t confront him about the Instagram because I didn’t want him to think I was stalking.

He started texting again, but it felt… forced. The spark was gone. Then one day, he told me his father had found out about our relationship and that we should stop talking for a while.

Something felt off. His father was far away, so how would he even know?

Still, I said okay and gave him space — weeks passed again.

Eventually, I posted another sad status. He called and said:

> “Can we just be friends again?”



I agreed. I respected his decision. I acted like a friend and even told him my family missed him (they didn’t know about our relationship, but he was close to them).
One day, my mom asked me to call him, so I messaged:

> “Brother, if you’re free, can you call?”



(I called him “brother” since my mom was next to me.)

He called, talked to my family, and then — completely ignored me again.

Then came my 18th birthday. I thought at least he’d wish me — as a friend.
But he didn’t.
I waited 2 days.
Still nothing.

I cried. A lot.
I messaged him out of anger:

> “You’re not even worthy of being a friend.”



He blocked me.

A few days later, he unblocked me again. I felt guilty and messaged him on his birthday — apologized for being rude.
He coldly replied:

> “Oh! I thought I wasn’t even worthy of being your friend.”



I apologized again. Still no proper reply. I wished him anyway.
I still hoped… maybe our friendship at least would survive.

One day, I had to pass by his house with my brother.
My brother wanted to talk to him — they used to be close.
But when my ex saw my brother walking toward him, he slammed the door shut in his face.
My brother came back in tears.

That was my breaking point.

He might hate me. Fine.
But why insult my little brother?

I finally blocked him.
I hate him…
But I don’t know why I still can’t stop thinking about him.

💭 So, Reddit — AITA for telling him he wasn’t even worthy of being a friend?

I don’t need something fancy, I just want somewhere quiet-ish where I can sit after 5pm with a book, maybe do some light coding, and not feel weird for being solo.

TLDR Is there a Melbourne version of that kind of place? What do people do if they just want to be out, but not social, and not at home?

*April 11, 2025*

Hi Reddit. I’m F25 and I’m honestly at my breaking point with this one. I need outside perspective because my entire family is acting like I’m Hitler for standing my ground.

So, I (25F) am a student software developer and a pretty serious PC gamer in my free time. I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment that I’ve spent years making cozy and functional. I saved up for a long time to build my dream PC setup … triple monitors, custom mechanical keyboard, ergonomic chair, the works. Altogether, my rig is worth a bit over $2,000, and I take care of it like it’s a damn child.

Last weekend, my older sister (30F) asked if she could crash at my place for one night because her apartment was being fumigated, and her husband was out of town. She has a 3-year-old son, Max, who’s… let’s say “spirited.” I love him, but he’s a little chaos goblin. I hesitated, but she swore she’d keep an eye on him and that it’d just be for one night.

They show up Saturday afternoon, and immediately it’s clear she wasn’t kidding about Max being a handful. Within ten minutes of arriving, he’d pulled four books off my shelf, thrown my houseplants on the floor, and spilled juice on my area rug. I tried to stay chill, he’s three, I get it … but I asked my sister politely to please keep him out of my office, where my PC setup is.

She rolls her eyes and goes, “He’s just exploring, he’s curious, it’s normal.” But she closes the office door anyway.

Cut to Sunday morning. I wake up to screaming. Max had apparently woken up before his mom, managed to open the office door, and decided my setup was his new jungle gym.

He pulled down one of my monitors, cracking the screen. He stuck crackers into the PC tower’s ventilation slots (I’m not kidding), yanked out my keyboard’s keycaps, and had colored on my chair with permanent marker. The cherry on top? He poured apple juice INTO the tower. INTO IT.

When I tell you I went silent… I mean dead silent. My sister comes in, sees the damage, and just says, “Oh nooo,” in this incredibly flat tone, like someone knocked over a cup of coffee. I start freaking out, and she has the AUDACITY to say, “You should’ve baby-proofed the room if it was that important to you.”

I lost it. I told her that 1) she KNEW he wasn’t supposed to be in there, 2) this is my space, not a damn daycare, and 3) baby-proofing a $2,000 gaming setup is not a standard requirement for adults living alone.

She told me to “calm down” and said that “he’s just a kid, and stuff is replaceable.” I told her she could replace it then. She said she didn’t have the money right now, but maybe in a few months she could give me a few hundred. I told her that wasn’t acceptable and that she needed to take full responsibility.

She left in a huff and now my whole family is blowing up my phone. My mom says I’m being “materialistic” and should understand that my nephew didn’t mean it. My dad said I should’ve “locked the door” if it was that important. My brother actually said, “Why do you even need three monitors anyway? That’s kind of overkill.”

I’ve filed a claim with my insurance but there’s no guarantee it’ll be covered since it was technically “guest damage.” I also told her that if she does not pay up, I'll take her to court for what happened.

Now I’m getting texts from my sister demanding an apology for “blaming her kid for being curious.” I told her I’d drop it if she covered the cost of repairs and replacements … or at least met me halfway … and she BLOCKED me.

So… Am I overreacting if I take my sister to court over this?

># UPDATE: 
*about 4 hours later*

Wow. Just wow. Four hours later, I wake up from my nap to this. Thank you guys, it'll take a bit for me to read all of this.

My sister still has not unblocked me, but her husband reached out to find out what happened. I'm sorry I don't have more to tell yet, but I'll update again when I do. Seriously, thanks for the insights everyone. My head is a lot clearer now ❤️

>#UPDATE2: 
*about 8 hours later*

Hey all. My sister’s husband reached out as mentioned earlier, and we’re working out a solution if possible. He’s been really understanding as have all of you.

Also, to clarify the office situation: my one-bedroom apartment is on the smaller side (33m2/355sq ft?), so the landlord converted an old ex-clothes cabinet into a makeshift ’office.’ It’s weird, but the building is from the 40s, and ig they had to get creative with the space with an old tenant or something. So its living room (sister and her kid slept there) + kitchen (i slept there) + the ’office.’

Thanks for all the support. And the award. I really don't have the words for how nice people have been in both DMs and the comments. ❤️‍🩹

*[About going no contact with the whole family for taking sisters side*
I’m not ready to go full no contact right now, but I really appreciate your perspective.

It’s definitely something I’ll keep in mind if things keep escalating and no one starts showing even a little respect for my boundaries.

I just want accountability, not drama. But if they keep pushing, I won’t hesitate to step back. I don't think I want to know my family if they can’t appreciate the work I put into my hobbies.

- 

As a bit of an update: my sister’s husband actually reached out to me privately earlier and said he wants to figure something out. He didn’t know the full extent of what happened (he suspected my sister lied to him and yeah), and he seemed genuinely sorry. That gives me a little hope.

Part of what’s made this so frustrating is that I work as a janitor (part time too) and don’t make a lot. I saved for years to build that setup and its not even a year old yet. Seeing it treated like it’s no big deal by my family members who know how much I struggle, has been honestly disheartening…

Your advice about collecting evidence and presenting it calmly is something I’ll definitely do. Just knowing I have a game plan and options helps a lot. Thank you!!!

- 

1. The “office” is a converted clothes closet. The apartment’s from the 40s and has a weird layout. There’s no lock on the door, the door is just a heavy old one.

Tbh I’ve been wondering if my sister might have opened it for him. I just don't get why???

2. The crackers and juice weren’t mine, sister brought them. I had no idea he had access to them during the night until after the fact.

3. I didn’t get much notice. I saw her message around 10AM Saturday, and they arrived around 2PM. My place was a mess, so I spent most of that time cleaning before they came by.

In hindsight, yeah, I should’ve been more cautious with my setup, but it didn’t even cross my mind that anything like this would happen as I thought the office area was inaccessible to him. What he did pull off of the shelves was moved higher up and out of reach and in an area where he could be kept an eye on.

- 

*[Somebody said she should've put her setup away before they came over as part of cleaning]*
…Are you my sister? You're really sounding like my sister. Unblock me if you are, but just in case…

I’m not talking about ”tidying up,” as in a few cans of this and that— my apartment was a MESS. I don’t live in a clinically ready space that can just be handed to a relative and a toddler on a short notice.

That four hours included making breakfast, cleaning, doomscrolling and bringing out the trash. I don’t understand this comment. Is it because I’m a janitor and should be quicker or something …?

*April 16, 2025, 5 days later*

Hey again.

Just wanted to post a quick update since it’s been a little under a week and a few people asked what happened next. Things are better, pretty fucking weird, and still ongoing, but here’s where we're at.

Last Saturday, my brother-in-law (BIL) came over to check out the damage himself. He actually brought Max (toddler) with him, which I was almost livid about at first, but he had a reason. He asked Max to try opening the office/closet door. The kid couldn’t do it. The door was too heavy for him.

You probably can guess where this is going. :=)

BIL offered to take my PC to the store that originally built it for me, just to see what was fixable. I agreed, but asked for something in writing just so I had some peace of mind. We put together a little agreement that he’d be responsible for it while it was with him. Yeah, yeah, it was just a formality and would not hold much merit anywhere, but it helped me feel a bit more in control.

On Monday, he dropped it off at the shop and gave them my number so they could keep me updated. He also told me he confronted my sister about how things played out. I sent him my original Reddit post too, he read the comments and apparently showed them to her. She still hasn’t unblocked me, and from what I’ve heard, was not happy about the fact my BIL is actually listening to me.

I also shared the post and some comments with my parents and brother since no one really believed me before. My parents still don’t fully get it, but they’ve at least stopped pushing back. My brother is more understanding now, though for some reason he mostly wanted to talk about how many people saw the post. I don't think either of those three still care, really, and I'm fine if they see this. Do better.

Anyway, I went to see the PC today (wednesday here). The shop said it’s mostly salvageable. It needs a very very careful internal clean and a few fans replaced, and some wiring fixed, but overall the main parts survived somehow. BIL told me he’ll cover the cost of the repair, no hesitation.

When I brought up what my sister said about not being able to pay even $200, he said she’s lying. He also said he’s not sure Max actually did all the damage. He thinks the door was left open on purpose, or that my sister might have even done some of it herself. Based on the height of the tower and where the crackers ended up, it didn’t quite add up to a toddler acting alone.

Apparently, she’s been telling him I have a “gambling addiction” (I did get a bit hooked on Genshin like 4 years ago I guess?) and that maybe this whole thing will “wake me up,” which is… new. She used to be supportive or at least indifferent. No idea where that switch came from.

So yeah. That’s where we’re at:

* My PC is being cleaned up and fixed, and BIL is covering the cost.
* Sister still has me blocked and won’t talk to me. Still tempted to start something with her tbh, especially if she actually did all of this on purpose.
* Still not ruling out small claims court depending on how things go.

Thanks again to everyone who responded to the original post. Seeing how many people understood what happened really helped me hold the line with my family when I felt like I was losing my mind.

One thing I’ve been turning over in my head lately is what if my sister *did* do something to my setup on purpose?

I don’t want to believe that, it feels like a stretch, but the more I think about it, the less so, I guess...? But then I remember how she acted when I asked her to keep Max out of the office. The eye-roll and the ""he's just curious"" comments like she didn’t take any of it seriously...??? And now hearing from my BIL that she’s been saying I have a “crippling gambling/gaming/whatever addiction” and needed to “grow up”????

It’s just… weird. She used to be cool about it. Never super into games herself, but she got that it was important to me. If something changed, I don’t know when or why. And if this was some weird way to make a point or “teach me a lesson”… that’s messed up. You're not our mom. How about talking first instead of this? I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but the more I think about it, the less it makes sense that Max could’ve done all of that alone. It's sick if she blamed her own son for it.

So yeah. Not accusing anyone outright, but that thought is there now.

And if you're my sister reading this… Which I'm guessing you are, because I bet you'd love to look at the comments that are on your side a lot. :)))

I don’t know why you blocked me. I don’t know what shifted in your head about all this. But if you actually had anything to do with damaging my setup whether it was on purpose or just through complete carelessness... Fuck. You. You know I worked hard for that. You know what that rig meant to me, and you know I would never do something like this to your stuff.

And if Max really did all of it on his own… I hope you’re paying closer attention now. Not for my sake, but for his. Read the comments on my first post again, from other parents and people with younger siblings who CLEARLY know better than you. That's all.

Thanks for reading, those who did.

*[People said it was suspicious BIL immediately took OOPs side and probably a) knows more than he lets on, and b) his wife did more on other fronts, so he knows what she is capable of.]*
Tbh… It sucks to admit but I think you're spot on. BIL is a very calm/happy person, but he seemed more resigned than anything when we met last weekend and idk. I get asking about it might not be my place but I’m worried. ://

- 

My chair is okay, the cushion, legs and back are stained with red permanent marker but I’ve learned to live with it. Coworkers and I are trying to find a chemical to fix the situation on the cushions, but an ethanol solution (small amounts, i dont want to ruin the chair further) has slowly been working at cleaning the other parts. (being a janitor does have its perks)

Keyboard… ehh. I could not find all of the keycaps that were pulled off. I replaced the missing ones with an old keyboard’s ones (both mechanical) so it’s a bit awkward but it works for now. I might get custom ones for it if I find some that fit.

The cracked monitor on the other hand needs to be replaced. I guess calling it ”cracked” was a kindness in itself. Still got the other two left and at least it wasnt the most expensive one… but yeah. 3:

- 

*[what sister told the defending family]*
My sister was talking incredible smack about me to them, making it seem like I ”screamed at her child” over a ”minor mistake.”

- 

I'll admit, during covid, I did spend $300 on Ganyu when she came out, but that was the ’worst’ of it. (And it was so worth it)

I don't play much anymore, (mostly stuck on Marvel Rivals rn) but the overall margin from Genshin release to this day I've spent under $600.

I get it, even that might look crazy to people who don't play video games, but sheesh. GAMBLING addiction…? Bruh.

She should be more concerned of what I spend on Pokemon packs in this economy, if she's gotta be concerned over something. 🤣🤣🤣

- 

We are waiting to see if my sister confesses to anything. If so, she will be paying out of her own pocket (and paying back), not my BIL. If she confesses and refuses, then, well… 👨‍⚖️📝🔒

The computer is essential, but the keyboard works and I still have two monitors. Thats why I am willing to wait for the other damage to be solved.

># [Update 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kds0zk/my_25f_sister_30f_is_spiraling_but_i_dont_know/)
*May 3, 2025, about 3 weeks after the first posting*

A few weeks ago, I made a post (not here) about how my sister’s toddler [3M] almost destroyed my PC setup. Long story short, she and her son were staying with me for one night, he got into my office, and the whole setup got wrecked with juice and cracker bits shoved into the tower. The situation was awful, and when I asked my sister for help covering the damage, she made an excuse and blamed me instead.

It became whole family drama. My sister blocked me and acted like the whole thing was my fault, but her husband (my BIL) reached out on his own. He checked the damage himself, helped take the PC in for repairs, and ended up covering the costs because he was genuinely embarrassed by the way she acted. He even started questioning whether their toddler could have done that much damage on his own, especially after the kid couldn’t even open the door by himself. My BIL thought maybe my sister left it open or did something herself.

Within a week of that, my BIL confronted her and well, she kicked him out of the house. Like, full-on, told him to get the hell out, packed up his things, dumped them and left them by the curb like he was a stray dog. He told me she screamed that he was “betraying her” and “taking the side of that fucking Reddit bitch,” meaning me. She also apparently accused him of conspiring and cheating on her with me to “humiliate her publicly,” which… What???

She hasn’t let him see their kid since. No visits. No phone calls. She’s gone full black hole mode and is completely unreachable, threatening cops if he goes near. She’s blocked me, my brother, even some extended family, and is only talking to our parents, who are still enabling her but I think its only so they can keep Max at arm’s lenght.

Meanwhile, I’m hearing rumors she’s been telling people I’m unhinged, psychotic, and that I made the whole thing up. She told one of our cousins that I “lured” her kid into the office like some kind of trap or setup.

I don’t know if this is postpartum-related, or if something snapped, or if she’s just always been this vindictive and I didn’t want to see it. But I’m scared. Scared for her kid. Scared for her husband. And yeah I’m also scared for myself, because if she’s willing to ruin her whole marriage and turn the family against me just to protect a lie…?

My parents want to keep it under wraps, but I know my BIL wants to get her help. I want to get her help too, but I don’t know where to start or what to do.

What can I start with to possibly push her towards someone who can help her out? Has someone here dealt with a situation like this before? I feel helpless, as I know she is an adult and has free-will but I fear for her safety and my nephew’s safety as well…

My BIL voiced wanting to divorce her and told my parents he will get his son whether they approve or not. His side of the family is furious with mine and I’ve no idea where I stand because yeah, I guess I started this.

Is this salvageable? If so, how? What can I do? Who can I contact within the states…? Is there anything I can do even? Does anyone know?

*October 2, 2025, about 6 months later*

Hey everyone.

It’s been a long while since I last posted, and honestly I wasn’t sure if I wanted to give another update at all. A lot has happened over the past six months, some of it good, some of it really heavy, and some of it that I’m still struggling to process. But I know a lot of you followed the whole thing from the beginning and my direct messages have been full of so many awesome, supportive people, I feel as if I owe all of you a final update before letting this matter go.

First, the positives: My PC is alive and well and has been for a while. The shop did a miracle job restoring it and it’s running beautifully again. It almost feels symbolic now, like after everything blew up in my life, at least this one thing that mattered to me is still standing. xd

I’ve also gotten closer to my brother-in-law (well, ex-BIL now, I guess, though it feels weird to call him that since he’s still family to me). He has full custody of my nephew, and that little kid is thriving. He’s calmer, happier, and honestly just a joy to be around in ways I didn’t even realize before. And he turned four *after* all the court stuff ended, so we could have his birthday in peace!!! :)

My BIL has his own family helping him, and I’ve been pitching in too whenever I can. It’s exhausting at times, but I don’t regret a second of it. My nephew deserves stability, and my BIL deserves support after everything he’s had to go through. Watching him step up as a single dad has been inspiring.

Now for the complicated part: my family.

When things first went down, my parents were still on my sister’s side, and I was basically the black sheep. But something happened during the legal proceedings that made them realize she wasn’t well and that I hadn’t been exaggerating about any of it. For the first time in what feels like forever, they stopped defending her blindly. They actually reached out to me, apologized, and admitted they’d been wrong... well, kind of. But I couldn't be asked to escalate it again. It’s been slow, but they’ve been trying to rebuild things with me. Part of me resents that it took them *this much* to finally see the truth, but I’m also relieved not to be completely estranged from my parents anymore. I'm still trying to decide what kind of a relationship they deserve to have with me after all of this.

As for my sister…

I don’t even know how to start. During the custody battle, she completely broke down. A lot of stuff came out, including the fact that she had broken and damaged other people’s things in the past (friends, her coworker's stuff), intentionally. She admitted she did it because, in her words, BIL “owed her more” as the mother of their child, and destroying things was her way of “making him notice her.”

She also said something else that stuck with me: that when she broke things, she felt powerful. She said people underestimated her, ignored her, treated her like she was just “a mom.” But when she destroyed something, she knew she couldn’t be ignored. It forced people to react, and it sure did. I know some of the people witnessing this in real time still pity her, which... I don't know how to feel about it.

Still, it explains so much of her behavior, not just with the PC, but with her marriage, with our family and how she’s spiraled. She wanted to feel like she mattered, but instead of asking for help in a healthy way or seeking support, she turned to control and destruction. And when that wasn’t enough, she escalated.

Writing that out makes me feel so sad, honestly. It’s like everything I suspected about the PC wasn’t just a suspicion. And to think all of this could have been avoided if she sought help or accepted going to couple's therapy properly. Apparently my BIL had suggested it a few times to her, but she declined.

After she lost custody of my nephew, things spiraled fast. She had a complete breakdown, and long story short, she’s now in jail awaiting transfer to a psychiatric facility. I don’t want to go into every detail, but it’s safe to say it’ll be a long time before I see her again. Or want to see her again.

And here’s the part I can’t quite make peace with: I feel bad for her.

I know that might sound crazy after everything she put me through, after how she tore our family apart, and after what she did to her own son. But she’s still my sister. There’s this ache I can’t quite get rid of, because I don’t know if the person she is now is who she always was, or if something in her just snapped along the way. I look back on our childhood and teenage years and wonder if there were signs that I missed, if there was some pattern of behavior I brushed off as moodiness or sibling rivalry that was actually something worse.

What complicates those feelings even more is everything that happened after my posts started spreading. I never expected them to blow up the way they did. I just wanted an outside perspective because my whole family was gaslighting me, making me feel insane for protecting my own belongings. And then, suddenly, it was everywhere. On Twitter, YouTube, Tiktok, even some news article was made about it. Someone tagged me to let me know that Smosh had even featured my story, which was surreal and honestly sort of humiliating in its own way. (Even though being noticed was kind of cool, I guess?)

Strangers were debating my family like it was some kind of reality TV show, and I had no control over it. At first, I was grateful for the validation, but over time, it started to eat away at my conscience. Keeping my posts public turned out to be a mistake.

I know hindsight is 20/20, but I regret not locking them down sooner. By the time BIL’s lawyer told us it would be best to hide everything, the damage had already been done. My sister had already seen the comments and the full force of the internet turned against her. And she hyperfixated on it.

That is not just me speculating either, one of our cousins told me she would rant constantly about it during the legal proceedings, always bringing it back to the posts and how I had “publicly humiliated her.” Apparently, she would spend hours scrolling, trying to dig up my posts, looking for new comments, even after I hid them. It was like pouring salt in a wound, and she couldn’t stop picking at it. 

I keep asking myself if I made things worse by letting it all stay up as long as it did. If I gave her more ammunition for her paranoia orr if I pushed her further toward the breakdown that ended with her losing everything. Part of me feels like I failed her, like maybe if I had been more careful, she wouldn’t have spiraled so badly. But then another part of me reminds myself that it wasn’t the internet that broke her, it was something already inside her. The posts didn’t cause her to smash my PC, or to lash out at BIL, or to neglect her own child. Those were choices she made long before Reddit ever came into the picture.

I realize there’s no point in deleting them. Even if I scrubbed my entire account clean, the internet never forgets. Copies are out there somewhere, archived and dissected on forums I’ll never even see. I can’t control that, no matter how much I might want to. What I can control is how I move forward, how I take care of myself, my nephew, and the family I still have.

The truth is, moving forward has been a mixed bag. On one hand, my daily life feels lighter without the constant chaos of my sister’s presence. I’m not coming home to find something broken, I’m not waking up to accusatory texts, and I’m not walking on eggshells waiting for the next outburst. That alone has been a kind of freedom I didn’t realize how badly I needed. On the other hand, there’s this strange emptiness where she used to be. Even if her presence was destructive, she was still there, part of the fabric of my family, and now there’s just this jagged hole.

My nephew asks about her sometimes. He doesn’t fully understand what happened, of course. He just knows “mommy is sick” and can’t take care of him right now. BIL and I try to keep our answers simple, but the truth is, I don’t know what kind of relationship, if any, he’ll be able to have with her in the future. I think about that a lot, because no matter how much I’ve been hurt by her, I can’t help but imagine what it’ll feel like for him one day when he’s old enough to learn the truth. How do you explain to a child that their mother did what my sister has done? How can it ever make sense to him? I don't know what to do when the day comes that either BIL or I have to explain what happened.

As for me, I’ve been in therapy since all of this started (recommended by some of the lovely people in the comments and in my direct messages, thank you.) At first, it was just a way to vent, but it’s become essential, to be honest. My therapist keeps reminding me that none of this is my fault and that my sister’s choices were her own, that I didn’t “ruin her life” by posting about the PC, and that it’s not my job to fix her. I hope to one day believe everything that my therapist is telling me.

As for my sister, I don’t know what the future holds for her, or if she’ll ever get better.

But if anyone else has problems like this, maybe be a bit more careful than I was. I spent the last months worrying I'd get charged with something for causing emotional turmoil over a Reddit post.

On a positive note, the stress caused me to get reconnected with an old hobby, retro electronics! Did you know the 3DS is considered retro now? I didn't! I feel old! I'm the same age as Pokemon Crystal!!!

Anyways, from now on I will be focusing on graduating and working to help my BIL pay off the debt that accumulated during the legal proceedings/investigation. But now that it's over, it's nice to know that at least for the coming months, things should be peaceful for me and those who matter the most to me. :)

Thank you to everyone who followed this from the beginning. ˚ʚ♡ɞ˚

1nwshk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1nwshk7/do_i_have_adhd_or_just_dopamine_dysregulation/,Do I have ADHD or just dopamine dysregulation?,"Hello,

I have recently been asking myself whether I suffer from ADHD or simply feeling the effects of dopamine dysregulation due to technology, which I am sure is getting more and more common these days. On top of that, it could be some other issue due to early trauma. The main reason I am reluctant to suspect ADHD is that I do not remember struggling with my present symptoms as a kid or adolescent.

I have drafted a rough description of my symptoms/'personality' below. This is highly condensed and unpolished but should give the gist, I hope.

Here it is: My life feels erratic, like I am constantly running out of time or there aren't enough hours in the day to get things done, or I am on fast-forward. Whenever I am doing something, my mind keeps jumping to the next thing I could be doing instead and sometimes I feel like I have to act on that impulse, unless I am engaging in creative work like music, in which case I can get engrossed in it for hours and feel more mentally calm. I would love to be able to organise my days and get multiple things done, and deeply admire those who can, but I just can't seem to and seem to only be able to focus on one major activity or two at the most within the day. I always feel like I need to rush off to do the next thing and struggle to concentrate or calmly get one task done before moving onto the next one. Busy work schedules overwhelm and stress me, I much prefer instead slow-paced work environments. I struggle with analysis paralysis, I am undecisive and get overwhelmed by too many options because I feel I need to check out and carefully evaluate each of of them, lest I choose the wrong one and regret it. I often change idea about my plan whilst in the middle of it or change course of action often. My internet browser can be full of open tabs and I jump from video to video or article to article before finishing one. I am extremely creative and have too many interests and too many ideas and not enough time to ever focus on any of finish a single project. I start lots of things but hardly ever finish them. Loud noises and people irritate me, in fact many things irritate me. Waiting and non-responsive technology can at times lead to anger outbursts when I am alone and I have smashed quite a few mobile phone screens and punched a few laptops because they were too slow/frozen. In intimate relationships I have mood swings and get easily irritated but in friendships and professional relationships I seem to be fine or be able to control these moods. My mind is always coming up with new tunes or songs, and I was an extremely creative child. I still am but since I started using smart phones and got a full time job I am unable to find time for my creative endeavours, which really hurts. When I get interested in something I need to do it straight away, I am unable to postpone it. Same thing if an idea creeps into my head that I need to buy something. On the contrary, if I am not interested in something or the deadline is not looming, I postpone that thing indefinitely, usually until it’s really late. In fact, things getting in the way of me wanting to do something lead to extreme frustration and irritation. One those rare occasions—these days—I am composing music and get interrupted I can get very irritated, but this was very common when I was a teenager living at home and people would knock on my door while I was in the middle of my creative process.  My day job can also feel extremely frustrating as it often feels understimulating and like I am wasting my precious time on meaningless, perfunctory tasks just for the sake of earning money when I could be doing so many more interesting, meaningful things. One of the best times I had in recent years was during COVID, when I retreated to a country home alone for months, was living off my savings and a part-time remote job, and had a slow life pace and plenty of solitude and time to focus on my creative endeavours. I can get engrossed into research a topics for hours, days and sometimes weeks if they peak my interests, and sometimes I am even unable to stop and go to bed or do chores. In fact, I almost never do chores, cuz they feel to me like wasting time (laundry, cleaning, hanging my clothes feels atrociously slow and like a waste of time). I am/have been addicted to pornography (I can waste a whole night or afternoon just consuming content), sex and cruising, going to bars (but not alcohol, just the thrill of flirting with someone), and coffee. Not the caffeine though, but the taste of coffee. If I do not get what I consider to be good coffee on any given day I can feel really frustrated and sometimes end up spending quite a bit of money to have two coffees in order to seek that 'rush'. I generally feel frustrated, like I have achieved nothing in my life or I am wasting my creative power, and when I am unable to create I feel meaningless. Long work shifts with nothing going on to keep me stimulated or busy schedules feel suffocating, I detest rule-based or meaningless structure, 9-5 jobs or sitting at a desk for a long time just 'for the sake of it', professional or mandated attire, performativity and 'work theatre' or 'productivity theatre', when people get together and, say, have meetings just to look busy but nothing gets done. I enjoy solitude, I struggle to find a meaningful job (I would want to live off my art but I am too scared to try), I detest small talk and people invading my personal space. I thoroughly enjoy moving around, freedom and independence in my work, including the ability to choose the space where I work and the hours, dislike inflexible deadlines, pressure, and impositions. In relationships, I often have conflicting feelings, like I think I wanna be with a person one day, then feel like I wanna break up with them the next. I handwrite very fast, sometimes so fast I skip letters because my mind skips ahead to the next part of the word before my hand can finish writing the present letter. I can read lots and have completed a PhD, but I easily get distracted when reading and have to re-read the same passage over and over, unless I find it highly interesting and engaging, in which case I can finish a book in a few sittings. I feel that, when I am unable to create, the above symptoms worsen and I feel more restless, dissatisfied and frustrated.

 Having said this, as mentioned above, I do not remember struggling with many of these things in very early adulthood, adolescence or childhood. I was for sure a highly creative kid (I used to make ‘stuff’, write stories, record music ‘albums’ etc.) but I was also good at school, had mostly very high grades (except in maths and science), and was told to be ‘very mature for my age’. I grew up with a controlling, authoritarian father who has grievous trauma, mood instability, and was prone to anger outbursts and a very affectionate but depressed mother. As such, I grew up as a hypervigilant kid. In my adolescence, I started developing all sorts of odd somatic anxieties, some of which were quite debilitating and got resolved after I left home to go to university (oh, I am gay and grew up in a homophobic environment). I think that many of the symptoms I described above, however, did not start or became debilitating until after I finished my PhD and started working. Until then, I was vastly in charge of my schedule and thus was able to get my PhD done by procrastinating and getting things done efficiently and quickly at the last minute, while maintaining a very flexible, slow-paced daily routine during the rest of the time. I also used to greatly enjoy being able to work on my research at my own pace and time. Having said that, even during my student days, I was always prone to sleeping very late and getting up late, and, come to think it, already had the feeling of 'wasting a lot of my time'. Still, I do feel my symptoms either appeared or got worse after I started using a smartphone. Since then and definitely since I stopped studying and started working, I feel my life has spiralled out of control. I do try to keep it all together by going to great lengths to find and keep jobs with very flexible and unstructered schedules, and that allows me to function ‘relatively’ well, but when my job schedule gets busy or I have several deadlines, that is when I feel overwhelmed and like things start falling apart.

Okay, I know that was a lot of information crammed into a few paragraphs. I am sure I have left out much, but there you go. Many thanks indeed to anybody willing to read/help. P.S. I have spent the past 24 hours consuming vast amounts of online content on ADHD and neurodivergence (I am feeling exhausted but I just cannot stop) and feel like I cannot do anything else until I have 'resolved' this (and yes, I am ignoring more impending deadlines), though I know of course I may have to consider counselling or therapy to get to the bottom of this. I do want to find out what's up with me, but do not want to fall into the trend of just getting a label or overexplaining everything by resorting to mental illness diagnoses (I am sure there's a name for that; there's a name for everything these days!)

1. Morning Routine
	•	I started my day with a juice made of sweet potato, kale, and apple (a small piece of sweet potato, one kale leaf, and half an apple blended and then strained, leaving only the juice).
	•	A 300 ml glass on an empty stomach, and I waited about one hour before eating anything else.

2. Gentle First Meal
	•	Something light and non-acidic, like plain yogurt with a little honey and some fruit.
	•	This helped my stomach feel comfortable and less irritated.

3. Healing Foods
	•	Added lots of broccoli (supports stomach regeneration).
	•	Ate light vegetables: corn, asparagus, peas, etc.
	•	Took probiotics in capsules.
	•	At meals: included sauerkraut, and afterwards, kefir — gut health is key for reflux healing.

4. Drinks & Herbal Support
	•	Chamomile tea with ginger: 2–3 times daily.
	•	Later, also tried Espinheira Santa tea, which was very beneficial.

5. Proteins & Restrictions
	•	Only lean meats (poultry and fish), without heavy seasoning or sauces.
	•	Completely avoided: tomato, onion, garlic, bread, pasta, sugar.

6. Daily Habits
	•	Last meal: 3 hours before bed.
	•	Last glass of water: 2 hours before bed (since even water can trigger reflux).
	•	Raised the head of the bed by 7 cm (using bricks 🧱).
	•	Regular walking and physical activity — staying upright helped a lot.
	•	Lost some weight, which also reduced reflux significantly.

7. Lifestyle Choices
	•	No coffee, alcohol, or tobacco. Coffee especially was a big trigger.
	•	Over time, my body adapted — and these healthier habits became natural.

8. Supplements That Helped
	•	L-Glutamine
	•	Zinc Carnosine
	•	Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice (DGL)
	•	Betaine with Pepsin

9. Results

After about 20 days, I noticed a huge improvement.
Now I can even enjoy an occasional coffee — without stress.

Good luck to everyone fighting reflux — healing is possible!

For decades, the hoodie has been a wardrobe staple—but it’s often been typecast: casual, sporty, sometimes even sloppy. At **Allwear**, that narrative changes. The **Organic Half-Zip Hoodie** takes this everyday classic and redefines it as a **polished essential**: refined enough for errands in the city, cozy enough for downtime, and versatile enough to anchor a minimalist wardrobe.

This isn’t your average hoodie. It’s the elevated version—stripped down, thoughtfully designed, and built to last.

**Comfort That Feels Refined**

The foundation of Allwear’s hoodie is its **organic cotton fabric**, which is both toxin-free and luxuriously soft. Unlike synthetic blends that can feel heavy or trap heat, this fabric is breathable and naturally insulating.

Slip it on once, and you’ll notice the difference: it’s comfort that feels **considered, not careless**.

**A Minimalist Take on Design**

Allwear’s Organic Hoodie embraces the brand’s **“less is more” philosophy**. Instead of oversized graphics or bulky construction, the focus is on:

* **A sleek half-zip front** for easy layering and a modern edge
* **Clean lines and a tailored fit** that drape without bulk
* **Neutral tones** that match seamlessly with any wardrobe

It’s still a hoodie, but one that communicates subtle refinement—whether you’re pairing it with joggers at home or trousers in the city.

**Versatility Beyond Loungewear**

What makes the Elevated Hoodie stand out is its ability to **transition effortlessly between roles**:

* **At Home**: A cozy layer for reading, relaxing, or working remotely.
* **On the Move**: Perfect for flights, errands, or weekend coffee runs.
* **Out & About**: Style it with wide-leg trousers and clean sneakers for a minimalist streetwear look.

It’s the hoodie that moves with you—never confined to one setting.

**Built for Everyday Wear**

Allwear doesn’t design pieces to be temporary. The Elevated Hoodie is constructed with **durability in mind**, holding its shape and softness wash after wash. It’s the kind of staple you’ll reach for year after year, making it not only a style investment but also a sustainable one.

And with **inclusive sizing from XXS to 7XL**, it ensures that **refined comfort is for everyone.**

**A Capsule Wardrobe Hero**

If you’re curating a **capsule wardrobe**, the Elevated Hoodie is a must-have layering piece. It bridges the gap between laid-back and polished, pairing just as easily with leggings as with cargos or tailored trousers.

Minimalists know that true essentials aren’t about quantity—they’re about **quality and adaptability**. The Elevated Hoodie checks both boxes.

**Final Word**

The **Allwear Organic Half-Zip Hoodie** proves that a hoodie doesn’t have to be basic or casual-only. By focusing on clean design, premium natural fabrics, and versatile wearability, it becomes something greater: an **elevated essential** that reflects Allwear’s vision of refined simplicity.

With this hoodie in your lineup, you’re not just dressing for comfort—you’re dressing with intention.",1,1759475872.0,allwearcom,0,1.0,False

Also, can we talk about the universal BPO starter pack?

* Unlimited coffee that somehow still doesn’t work after 3 AM.
* A headset that makes you look like a low-budget K-pop idol.
* That one teammate who has full energy at 4 AM (we all secretly hate you).
* And of course, the life-saving “after-shift inuman” where you drink at 8 AM like it’s happy hour. 🍻

Chapter 1 

While I was doing laundry for my son, I found a condom in his school uniform pocket. 

Then **I** saw the disturbing texts on his phone. My son was definitely up to something. 

I posted for advice: \[My eighth-grade son is dating, what should I do?\] 

Top comment: \[You should worry about yourself first, not your son.\] 

What? I asked them what they meant. 

They replied: \[Dude, take a closer look at your screenshot. ""Clean up quickly, Room 1508 at the Horriston Hotel, I don't want to hear any pleading."" Kids don't talk like that. Also, the Horriston Hotel costs $150 a night. Where would your son gets that kind of money?\] 

\[Plus, hotels require a credit card for reservations these days. How would a middle schooler even book a room?\] 

\[I'll bet twenty bucks, it's not your son who's dating. You need to check his phone... and prepare for what you might find.\] 

The comments were getting crazier. 

The speculation in the comments just got crazier and crazier the further I read. 

A new reply suddenly popped up under the top comment. 

Someone highlighted part of my screenshot and wrote: \[Public service announcement for everyone, see that ""sildenafil"" in the chat? 

That's Viagra. You know, to... enhance sexual performance.\] 

\[A teenage boy doesn't need that. Middle schoolers get excited just from Victoria's Secret ads.\] 

\[I bet the OP's husband is using the kid's phone to text his mistress. This isn't a coming-of-age love story, folks! If you agree**,** hit like!\] 

The likes kept rising, climbing to the top. 

At first, I thought this was absurd. 

But as I kept reading, my palms started to sweat. 

I felt tightness in my chest. Everything became blurry. 

Even **so**, I couldn't bring myself to believe Adrian, my perfect Alpha mate, would betray me. 

I heard the sound of keys at the front door. 

Adrian wasn't home. 

He'd gone to a conference in the next city and had been gone for two days. 

When he's away, we text and FaceTime non-stop. 

He even tells me when he's eating or taking a shower. 

The first thing he did was pull me into a deep embrace. 

Then, he cupped my face in his hands, his nose nuzzling gently against my neck as he inhaled my scent. 

""Baby, two days felt like forever. I missed you so much 

He produced a small, elegantly wrapped box. 

A Bulgari necklace. 

"" 

He remembered. I only glanced at it once while we were shopping 

Noticing my lack of excitement, his expression shifted to concern.

Okay, maybe not *burn it down*, but my internal monologue was definitely spiraling at 1 AM. Another Tuesday, another kitchen counter piled high with someone else’s dinner remnants. Chloe’s ceramic bowl, Liam’s ramen pot, Maya’s smoothie blender—it was like a museum of forgotten meals. I swear, sometimes I felt like I was living with actual toddlers. NGL, the passive-aggressive energy I was radiating was probably palpable through the walls.

I took a deep breath, trying to channel my inner zen, but it was *gone*. This wasn't the first time. It felt like a lowkey silent battle for weeks, each of us hoping someone else would crack and do the communal dishes. I’d tried leaving little notes (""Kindly wash your dishes, folks!""), but they just seemed to disappear into the ether, like the dirty spoons themselves. I genuinely thought we were all mature adults, but this kitchen situation was sending me. I just wanted to make myself some tea without having to excavate a clean mug. Seriously, how hard is it?

That night, fueled by a potent mix of sleep deprivation and righteous indignation, I snapped. I didn't yell. I didn't send a scathing group text. Instead, I carefully gathered every single dirty dish, pot, and utensil, stacked them all neatly, and then—I put them *in front* of the respective bedroom doors. My heart was pounding, but also, lowkey, I felt a surge of petty victory. Let's see them ignore *that*.

The next morning was, predictably, awkward. Chloe emerged first, blinking at the ceramic bowl by her door, then looking at me. ""Uh, good morning?"" she offered, a sheepish grin spreading across her face. Liam, usually reserved, actually chuckled when he saw his ramen pot. Even Maya, who usually ghosts out early, stopped to stare at her blender.

I didn't say anything, just poured my coffee. Chloe, bless her heart, finally broke the silence. ""Okay, valid. Point taken, Sarah. My bad."" Liam nodded in agreement. Maya, surprisingly, added, ""Yeah, no cap, we've been slackin'. My bad too."" We ended up having a proper sit-down later that evening, not a heated argument, but an actual conversation. We talked about how we all felt, how the mess was impacting everyone's vibe. We decided on a rotating chore chart for the kitchen, and, honestly, it felt like a weight lifted.

That night, we ordered a huge pizza, laughed about ""The Great Dish Migration of '24,"" and for the first time in a while, the kitchen felt like a shared space again, not a battleground. We even started planning a house movie night. It wasn't just about clean dishes; it was about truly seeing each other and making our shared space feel like home again. We love to see it.

1nws2te,https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/comments/1nws2te/anhedonia_feeling_the_atmosphere_of_places/,Anhedonia - feeling the atmosphere of places,"I wanted to ask you about a specific dimension of anhedonia - the lack of feeling the atmosphere of places.

I'll explain what I mean.

Since childhood, I've had this tendency for certain places to evoke certain emotions, feelings, memories - I could simply feel the atmosphere of those places. It could be a specific building, a landscape, or a specific location during changing weather conditions - for example, rain or fog.

When I became depressed, I started taking SSRIs, and anhedonia set in, and I slowly lost that feeling. Now, after years on antidepressants, I've been off all medication for almost a year and a half, and I feel NOTHING.

I'm interested in photography of landscapes and historic buildings. The easiest way to see if I feel it is by looking at photos of these places online – currently, I feel nothing. Absolute emptiness; they don't move me at all, they don't evoke any emotions or memories, and I have no desire to be there.

To make matters even more interesting, some of the medications that restored this sensation were SSRIs -but not always, not all of them, not at all doses - it was very inconsistent. I remember once being on a higher dose of paroxetine (40 mg) for a very long time, and it would appear when I drank coffee. It was similar when I started taking fluoxetine. When I looked at the photos, these emotions arose. I felt the urge to go there and photograph these objects.

Do you experience the same thing with this sense of places? I remember user ""caffeinehell"" writing about this sense of atmosphere – that's when I realized that anhedonia has many facets and symptoms.

This feeling of atmosphere can also apply to, for example, meeting people, being with them at a party, in a beautiful place, etc. Let's imagine, for example, a beautiful sunset in the mountains with a loved one - a normal, healthy person would feel it with all their senses - I feel NOTHING.

I admit that this symptom of anhedonia bothers me the most. It's related to my passions and interests, which I've had to abandon because I don't feel any pleasure.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From a medical perspective, I suspect I have underactivity in my prefrontal cortex and VTA/NAc, but this effect on SSRIs shows me that serotonin (specifically, 5-HT1a activation) is required for plasticity in these areas. There are studies on this topic:

**""Effect of Dopaminergic D1 Receptors on Plasticity Is Dependent of Serotoninergic 5-HT1A Receptors in L5-Pyramidal Neurons of the Prefrontal Cortex""**

I suspect that for me (and probably for some of you) the benefit will be increasing dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, which activates D1 receptors (activating D2 in this area has the opposite effect - that's why atypical neuroleptics combined with SSRIs are sometimes effective - they increase dopamine in the mPFC, which activates D1 and D2 are blocked by these drugs), which in turn increases AMPA and then acts like ketamine:

**""Ketamine-like effects of a combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine on AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat""**

**""Adjunctive Treatment with Asenapine Augments the Escitalopram-Induced Effects on Monoaminergic Outflow and Glutamatergic Neurotransmission in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex of the Rat""**

I have had some temporary improvement in anhedonia with the combination of mirtazapine (dopamine in the mPFC) with an SSRI and olanzapine with fluoxetine.

Unfortunately, we know how SSRIs work and that some people on this forum experience anhedonia from these medications. Their major drawback is that they activate 5-HT2c receptors, which reduces VTA firing and, consequently, dopamine in the NAc – this in itself causes anhedonia.

Therefore, I'm looking for other solutions, other medications. There aren't many options. I haven't tried ketamine or rTMS, but I think they would work well in activating the mPFC and VTA. If all goes well, I'll try them next year.

In summary:

I see increasing mPFC activation as very important in anhedonia, which can be achieved by increasing dopamine in this area – but 5-HT1a activation is also necessary. The result is AMPA activation > mTOR and plasticity. Increasing pyramidal neurons in the mPFC increases VTA activation > NAc and quiets the amygdala. Increasing dopamine alone may not be enough; increased circuit activation and plasticity must occur. Theoretically, ketamine should be the most effective, but as we know, it doesn't work for everyone - why is that? I don't know.

I visited Berlin last year to attend a similar conference. I stayed in a hostel that time and had the chance to meet up with other travelers and explore the city a bit. That was my first time in a different country which also ended up giving me a handful of firsts (first time having Sushi, Meat balls and Doner kebab, being on a tram, for example). I think back to that trip very fondly and wish I had more time to explore the city, as I only had a couple of days or so and very little money to explore outside the conference.  
This time, I am planning for a longer trip and I am also visiting my friend who just recently moved (close) to Munich to pursue his Master's degree at the TUM Straubing Campus. I am really into programming and software development, I recently also started dabbling with entry level ML courses. I play football (ironically, I don't watch it at all anymore), badminton and I hit the gym (though I wouldn't refer to myself as a gymrat, I just started out). I absolutely love coffee, and really came to like hanging out in pubs after my trip to Berlin. My favorite way to kick it back is with a few beers and good company. I got absolutely piss drunk with an Irish dude during my last trip. Turns out mixing 4 beers, coffee and pre-mixes is a very bad idea. I want to explore new activities, cuisines and places. Rock climbing and volunteering are something I have wanted to do for some time now. Oh, and I am looking to get a tattoo while I am there. I know a little bit of German from Duolingo with a 280 day streak XD

For centuries, books have been written the same way: one author, countless hours, and endless cups of coffee. But in today’s digital age, authors aren’t writing alone anymore.

Enter **AI-assisted writing**—a new way to create books faster, smarter, and with more polish. But the big question is: **does an AI-written book actually compare to a human-written one?**

And more importantly… which option helps you **make money with AI** as an author?

# ✍️ The Human-Written Book

There’s no denying the power of a purely human-written book. Every sentence carries the author’s voice, creativity, and personal experiences. Readers can feel the authenticity.

But here’s the challenge:

* Writing takes **months (sometimes years)**
* Editing and polishing require extra investment
* Many great ideas **never see the light of day** because authors run out of time

If you’ve ever dreamed of writing a book, you know how overwhelming the process can feel.

# 🤝 The Human + AI Co-Written Book

Now imagine this: instead of staring at a blank page, you have an **AI co-writer** by your side.

Here’s how it changes the game:  
✅ **Speed** – Draft chapters in days, not months  
✅ **Structure** – AI helps outline, organize, and keep flow consistent  
✅ **Creativity boost** – AI generates ideas you might not have thought of  
✅ **Editing support** – Grammar, style, and formatting handled instantly

The result?  
A book that still feels **human**, but is written **faster, cleaner, and more market-ready**.

# 💡 So, Which One Helps You Make Money with AI?

Truth is, **both methods can make money**—but the hybrid approach gives you the edge.

* **Human-only writing** → deeply personal, but slower to monetize.
* **Human + AI writing** → efficient, scalable, and lets you publish multiple books faster.

The more books you publish, the more income streams you create—whether through **Amazon Kindle, eBooks, or audiobooks.**

This is exactly why authors and entrepreneurs are turning to AI-assisted writing.

# 🚀 How to Start Writing Smarter

If you’re curious about blending human creativity with AI efficiency, tools like [**Aivolut Books**](https://aivolut.com/books/) make it simple.

With Aivolut, you can:  
👉 Generate book outlines and drafts in minutes  
👉 Polish writing with AI suggestions  
👉 Accelerate your publishing process  
👉 Create content that feels authentically *you*

The faster you publish, the sooner you can start to **make money with AI** through your books.

# 📌 Final Thoughts

The choice isn’t “AI vs. Human.” It’s **Human + AI.**  
The best books of the future won’t be written by machines alone, but by authors who know how to **leverage AI as a partner.**

If you’ve been waiting to finally write (and profit from) your book, now’s the time. AI makes it faster, easier, and more possible than ever.

# What is bacopa, and why do brains seem to like it?

*Do we start with a plant or with a problem?* We start with a plant, oddly enough. Bacopa monnieri—also called brahmi—grew up in Ayurveda and ended up in lab notebooks for one plain reason: it helps people form and keep memories. You take a standardised extract, you give it time, and recall stops slipping through your fingers quite so quick.

[Bacopa for Memory](https://preview.redd.it/dosadtcggusf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d236358837eebd1fbb93fa30b804390808290681)

Is this just “brain health” waffle? Nah, that’s lazy. What we see is fewer tip-of-the-tongue stalls, cleaner recall after a delay, and a small lift in how long attention holds without wobble. That’s not fireworks; that’s Monday going a bit smoother. If your base habits are messy, though, bacopa can’t mop all that. Set sleep first—[**sleep for better focus**](https://herbalnootropics.life/sleep-for-focus) lays out the bits that actually move the needle, no faff, no sugar on top. Then layer bacopa as the steady helper, not the hero cape.

What makes it plausible under the hood? The word you see is “bacosides”. These compounds support antioxidant enzymes, reduce lipid peroxidation, and keep mitochondria from acting like knackered batteries. That reads dry, sure, but neurons like stable energy and low background inflammation. Add small acetylcholinesterase inhibition, and you get more acetylcholine time-on-task, which the memory circuits rather enjoy. Sounds tidy, because it is tidy. One last thing—keep expectations normal-sized. You won’t wake up Shakespeare on day two; you’ll likely notice fewer small slips by week six.

# 2) What memory skills change first, and how can you tell?

What do people actually notice first, like in real life not lab-land? Lists stick. Names don’t leg it so fast. You stand up to do a thing and still recall the thing, which sounds tiny till it saves two minutes five times a day. Working memory goes from slippery to grippy; you hold a number while the kettle moans and still punch it in right. That’s a feel thing, but you can measure it without turning your home into a clinic, promise.

How do you track this without getting bored to tears? Keep three dinky metrics: deep-work minutes (Pomodoro ≥25 minutes only, no cheating), planned-tasks completion percentage (done ÷ planned, simple maths), and a “recall felt easy?” score from 1–10. That’s it. Takes one minute. Do a weekly delayed-recall check with the same 15-word list and note errors, not pride points. If week six beats week one, you’re not imagining it, mate. Keep caffeine flat; changing five variables then guessing which one worked is how we all lie to ourselves, a lil bit anyway.

Is there a bigger picture for context, like where bacopa sits in a sensible routine? Yes, and it’s not glamorous. You stack low-risk, single-ingredient steps before fancy blends. Read [**benefits of natural nootropic supplements**](https://www.herbalnootropics.life/benefits-natural-nootropic-supplements) for how to judge ingredient lists, standardisation, and dose honesty. If you prefer blends later, cool, but get your personal baseline first. That way data talks, vibes don’t. And keep notes like you’ll forget (because you will, ironically): date, dose, sleep hours, stress level, any stomach grumbles. That tiny log makes decisions easy and future you less cross.

# 3) Attention, focus, and working memory: are they the same thing?

Aren’t these just synonyms someone sprinkled about to sound clever? No, and the difference matters. Working memory holds and manipulates info for a short spell; attention filters noise; focus keeps you with one chosen task while the rest taps on the window like rain. Bacopa tickles each of these, but working memory often blinks first on tests like digit span and spatial span. Less drop, fewer “uhh, where was I” moments mid-tab-switch. That feels small. It’s not. It’s where productivity hides.

How does this land during a messy day with pings and people? You catch notifications, glance, and do nowt because your brain actually shields the task. You dial a number while someone asks a question, answer them, and still hit the right digits—no backtrack. Reaction times wobble less after a stressful meeting. Focus sessions extend by five to ten minutes before the first urge to fidget. That’s not drama; that’s friction falling. Feels almost boring, which is how you know it’s real.

Want a dirt-simple drill that builds the same muscles? Try an “n-back-lite”: read a stream of digits at one per second and say the previous one (1-back) for two minutes. Rest a minute. Do five rounds, three days a week. Track errors. That’s your floor. If you’re curious about adding a multi-ingredient product later, park this for later reading: [**SynaBoost natural nootropic review**](https://www.herbalnootropics.life/synaboost-natural-nootropic-review). It shows how brands combine cholinergic, adaptogenic, and antioxidant angles without making folks jittery. Start simple, then compare. Easy life.

# 4) Stress, cortisol, and staying sharp under pressure

Why mention stress in a memory article; isn’t that scope creep? Not really. Cortisol can nick your recall when pressure spikes, and that is when recall matters most. Bacopa behaves like an adaptogen: it softens the over-reaction so you keep a steady hand while the inbox does its usual siren act. We’re not talking couch-level calm here; we’re talking “carry on without silly mistakes” calm. Reduced distractibility shows up in reaction time tasks and fewer post-stress errors. That’s the money.

What changes on a rough day you can’t dodge? After a tough call, you don’t need a full reset just to re-enter a spreadsheet. Your error rate in simple copy-paste tasks doesn’t jump like a cat. Working memory bumps down less when interruptions pile up. You finish work chunks before checking chats. And then you check chats, like a normal human who isn’t pretending to be a monk. The shape of the day shifts from ragged to blocky, and blocky days ship more.

What pairs well with bacopa for stress without starting a supplement orchestra? A walk outside (ten to twenty minutes), two set focus blocks before lunch, and one good bedtime habit. If your sleep’s messy, you’ll spin your wheels; fix that first with [**sleep for better focus**](https://herbalnootropics.life/sleep-for-focus). Keep coffee steady. Keep email windows closed during focus blocks. Tiny rules beat heroic plans you won’t follow. It’s not glamorous, I know, but the graphs do not care for vibes—they chart what you actually did, not what you meant to do, which is a bit rude but fair.

# 5) The neuroprotective toolkit: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and more

Is there a mechanistic backbone here, or are we waving hands about? There’s a backbone. Bacosides support the brain’s antioxidant systems, which means less oxidative stress and fewer “lipid peroxidation” messes—think membranes staying intact so signalling stays crisp. Mitochondrial function holds up better, so neurons don’t sulk mid-afternoon. That sort of cellular housekeeping sounds dry, but it’s the bedrock that keeps circuits tidy under load.

What about inflammation—does that actually hit recall? Microglia can go loud when they shouldn’t; pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6 climb and start causing collateral damage near synapses. Bacopa nudges these pathways down (NF-κB signalling included), which lowers the background noise of neuroinflammation. Less noise means cleaner plasticity and steadier long-term potentiation, which is fancy for “learning sticks better”. Add anti-apoptotic moves—modulating Keap1-Nrf2, easing caspase activity, keeping mitochondrial membranes stable—and you’ve got a broad “protect and preserve” profile that suits long-haul brain health.

Any action on transmitters and the nastier protein tangles? Bacopa mildly inhibits acetylcholinesterase, leaving acetylcholine on the scene a tick longer for memory work. In models, it leans against β-amyloid and Tau aggregation, which you’ll recognise from Alzheimer’s chat. We’re not selling miracles here; we’re noting converging nudges in the same helpful direction. Stack these with baseline lifestyle (sleep, activity, boring hydration), and you get an odds-improver. Not a wand. An odds-improver. That’s grown-up science, a bit unsexy, very useful.

https://preview.redd.it/h66189fvgusf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=17aa9245766c1ce53e3e268e412c7795e6d50284

# 6) Who should actually consider bacopa—and who should leave it be?

Is this only for students cramming with highlighters and hope? Not at all. Healthy adults who want steadier recall can benefit. Older adults often report easier acquisition of new information—new names, new routes, new Wi-Fi passwords that shouldn’t be that long but are. Busy professionals like the way attention doesn’t fray at 3pm quite as fast. The common thread: consistent daily use, patient tracking, and realistic expectations. That trio beats any “super herb” headline, every time, promise.

What about ADHD traits—does bacopa help or is that wishful thinking? Evidence is early but suggestive. Some people report calmer distractibility and better working memory, which shows up as fewer mid-task detours and less tab-sprawl. It is not a replacement for clinical care. It is a small lever that sometimes moves a bigger rock a few centimetres, which can be enough to change a day’s shape. If you’re weighing single-ingredient versus blends, read [**benefits of natural nootropic supplements**](https://www.herbalnootropics.life/benefits-natural-nootropic-supplements) to see how to judge blends without getting dazzled by long labels.

Who should avoid or seek medical advice first? Pregnant or breastfeeding folks should pass. People with thyroid disorders, GI blockages, slow heart rate, or some lung conditions should speak with a clinician. If you’re on medicines that affect acetylcholine (certain Alzheimer’s drugs), thyroid hormones, or anything that leans on CYP450 pathways, check with a pharmacist. Boring safety chats save headaches—literally sometimes. If you later want to test a blend, the [**SynaBoost natural nootropic review**](https://www.herbalnootropics.life/synaboost-natural-nootropic-review) shows how brands state standardisation and what that actually means on the label.

# 7) Dose, standardisation, timing, and the week-by-week timeline

What dose actually did something in human trials—not just on a label? The boring, consistent answer is 300 mg per day of a standardised extract at roughly 20–24% bacosides. Some trials run 450–600 mg/day, but 300 mg is the sensible, well-tolerated starting point. Take it once daily or split into two 150 mg doses if your stomach’s a bit precious. Many people take it with food; some don’t; your gut will vote and you will listen. That’s science too, just messier.

When does it kick in—tomorrow, next Tuesday, or later? Expect a whisper by week 4–6, then a clear bump by week 8–12. That shape repeats a lot. Intriguingly, some studies see gains hang around for a few weeks after stopping, which hints at plasticity changes rather than a simple on/off effect. Keep caffeine stable, keep sleep regular, and don’t stack ten new behaviours then guess. You can’t out-smart confounding variables with optimism, sadly.

# Quick reference you can screenshot and be done with it

|Item|Details|
|:-|:-|
|Standard dose|300 mg/day (20–24% bacosides)|
|Dosing pattern|1×300 mg or 2×150 mg with meals|
|First signs|Week 4–6 (subtle)|
|Stronger change|Week 8–12 (clear)|
|Trackers|Deep-work minutes; task completion %; “recall easy?” 1–10|

If you decide later to compare a single-ingredient run with a blend, do them in separate blocks. That A/B makes your notes useful instead of cute. Keep one off-day per week if your gut says so; compliance beats perfection with a stick.

# Safety, interactions, and how to run a clean experiment

What side effects pop up most, and are they scary? GI stuff leads the list: nausea, cramps, more frequent bowel movements, dry mouth. Usually mild, often fade, food helps. If symptoms hang about or annoy you, reduce the dose or stop; common sense isn’t fancy but it works. If you’ve any thyroid history, have that chat first; tidier to prevent than to patch.

Which interactions should put you on alert? Medicines that touch acetylcholine signalling (some Alzheimer’s treatments), thyroid hormones, and drugs using CYP450 pathways may tangle with bacopa. That doesn’t mean “never”; it means “ask someone who knows your meds”. Pharmacists save more days than they get credit for. If you’re on lots of supplements already, list them all in one note and check overlaps for the cholinergic angle, just so you don’t stack like a magpie collecting shiny things.

- Aries: they are big on smoothies and boba. Not coffee though. Drinks that are also snacks. Like, not cooooool, but cool! 

- Taurus: gave me a whole pantry. “Feel free to showcase your creativity!”

- Gem: ok so Gem men do not buy me food whatsoever and it’s ridiculous! 👎👎👎 

- Cancer: baked goods! Soups for cold days! Perfect husband materials!

- Leo: they host parties. I need to show up, and look like I contribute.

- Virgo: Virgo men and their never ending explanations implore I must check out Arby’s. Like 9/10 of them. I’ve explained I eat at Potbelly, to no avail. 

- Libra: they know the one item I like and appease me with that one item like it’s a class assignment. At least it’s something! 

- Scorpio: Scorpios understand sandwiches. Ie. Bread to meat ratio, the secret sauce, the punch card, economic incentives, etc. I need food that’s filling, especially if I have to work an irregular 12 hrs shift on a Saturday. 

- Sag: hot pot. Soups for days that aren’t cold, so to speak. Seafood, meat, brothy mixture abound.

- Capricorn: I don’t think Capricorns ever eat anything remotely tasty. I think they eat calculators. 

- Aquarius: it’s like another Gemini. Shame! 

- Pisces: Pisces sent me cookies and I had diarrhea. Then they got other people to bring me more cookies at my workplace. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!!!!

I would always tell my coffee crowd about my antics - transferring money to myself for profit, parking money in casinos and getting rewarded for doing so before withdrawing my cash and laughing all the way to the bank. If I was in their shoes I would be falling over myself to follow that yellow brick road.

  
I even had my own brother ask me to stop sharing offers with him. I know he does alright for money and he doesn't have kids but I never could imagine a time where i wasn't up for a spot of shenanigans to get a few extra quid.

  
I remember telling my nephews about some of my antics and they positively gushed with enthusiasm. I set up a whatsapp group with them, sent them links and stuff. They did exactly nothing. They are both students, they always want extra cash - right?

Meet the **Allwear Organic Sweat Shorts**, available in **3"", 5"", and 7"" inseam lengths**. Whether you prefer a shorter cut for workouts, a mid-length for all-around wear, or a longer fit for added coverage, these shorts are designed to move with you. And with versatile shades—**Black, Bone, Mist, and Sand**—they pair effortlessly with your everyday wardrobe.

# Softness You’ll Want to Live In

The moment you slip into these shorts, you’ll feel the difference. Made from a **non-toxic, GOTS- and OEKO-TEX-certified organic cotton fleece blend**, they deliver plush softness that feels gentle on your skin, breathable on your body, and unbeatably cozy over time. And, intentionally, there’s **zero polyester or nylon**, so you avoid the synthetic fabric drawbacks entirely.

# Built for Movement, Designed for Life

These shorts are all about utility with comfort. Equipped with **three spacious pockets**, they ensure your essentials stay secure—whether you’re lounging at home, grabbing a quick coffee, or heading out for errands. The **different inseam options (3"", 5"", 7"")** let you choose the cut that matches your lifestyle best: short and breezy, balanced mid-thigh, or slightly longer for added ease.

# A Wardrobe That Works for Everyone

Inclusivity isn’t just a buzzword here—it’s baked into the design. Available in sizes **XXS through 7XL**, Allwear welcomes a broad range of body types with open arms. Plus, with colorways like **Black, Bone, Mist, and Sand**, styling them is effortless—neutral shades that go with everything.

# The Health and Eco Edge

Synthetic alternatives often rely on harmful additives—like **phthalates**, **BPA**, **antimony**, and **PFAS (""forever chemicals"")**—that threaten both our health and the environment. Allwear’s shorts sidestep all of that. You get pure organic cotton comfort without the hidden chemical baggage. And by refusing polyester or nylon, they help reduce microplastic pollution in washwater too.

# Versatile, Year-Round Wear

These shorts don’t clock out when seasons change. They're **easy to style and functional for any activity, any time of year**—whether paired with a tee for summer ease, layered over tights in cooler weather, or simply worn as the perfect at-home lounge essential.

# What Sets Them Apart

Here’s why the **Allwear Organic Sweat Shorts** are worth the upgrade:

1. **Three inseam lengths** – 3"", 5"", and 7"" to suit every preference.  
2. **Premium soft feel** – crafted with eco-certified organic cotton fleece, no synthetics allowed.  
3. **Functional pocket design** – three large pockets keep your essentials close.  
4. **Inclusive sizing** – thoughtfully sized from XXS to 7XL.  
5. **Safe and sustainable** – non-toxic materials that support your health and protect the planet.  
6. **Four versatile colors** – Black, Bone, Mist, and Sand, easy to mix and match.  
7. **Effortless versatility** – designed for comfort, ease, and all-season styling.  

# The Final Sit-Down

In a world filled with throwaway fashion, these shorts stand out—slow, intentional, and built to last. They’re a statement that comfort doesn’t have to cost the earth or compromise your well-being.

If you're someone who appreciates clothing that’s soft, inclusive, practical, and sustainably designed—make these your go-to. The **Allwear Organic Sweat Shorts** are quietly confident essentials that feel as intentional as they look.

1nwrs03,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nwrs03/whats_the_real_difference_between_portable_mug/,What's the real difference between portable mug warmer types?,"Hey everyone! I've been using mug warmers for years, and I thought I'd share my experience with different types since I see this question pop up pretty often.

I remember how frustrated I used to get when my coffee would go cold while I was working. After trying various mug warmers, I've learned there's actually quite a bit of difference between them.

First, let's talk about basic electric warmers. These are the most common ones you'll find - basically a hot plate for your mug. They're simple and usually pretty cheap, but here's the catch: they only heat from the bottom, which means uneven warming. I used one for about six months before upgrading.

Then there's the gravity-sensing warmers - these are pretty cool. They automatically turn on when you place your mug down and off when you lift it. I got mine from this store (https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer) and it's been a game-changer for my home office setup.

The newest tech I'm excited about is temperature-control warmers. These let you set exact temperatures, usually between 95-165°F. They're perfect if you're picky about your drink temperature (like me with green tea). Found a great deal on one here: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer

USB-powered warmers are another option, but honestly, they're hit or miss. The power output isn't always enough to keep drinks properly hot. I tried one and went back to a regular plug-in version after a week.

Some key things to consider:
- Power source (USB vs. wall plug)
- Temperature control options
- Auto-shutoff features
- Size (some only fit standard mugs)
- Material compatibility (glass vs ceramic)

Pro tip: If you're using a warmer regularly, ceramic mugs work best. They retain heat better than glass and distribute it more evenly.

I've noticed my productivity actually improved since getting a good mug warmer - no more multiple trips to the microwave! Plus, it's way better than repeatedly reheating coffee, which can make it taste bitter.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions - I've probably tried most brands out there at this point!",1,1759473480.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nwrovg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Razmik_raz/comments/1nwrovg/natasha_part_2/,Natasha- Part 2,"""Natasha, stay here. I'll be back, okay? You can watch TV. Can you climb on a chair and lock the door from inside after I leave?"" Natasha nodded. Voider put on a cartoon channel on TV and walked out. Natasha did as he said and sat down on the couch dangling her feet, watching Masha and the Bear. The cartoon got her fully engrossed in it within minutes. By the time Voider came back, she was asleep on the couch. He knocked loudly on the door. She didn't wake up. The TV was blaring. Stupid cartoon show. It's designed to scratch all your nerves. Voider went to the backdoor and picked the lock. She's fast asleep. He almost picked her up before he saw the bloodstains on his clothes. He went to the bathroom and cleaned himself of the blood and changed clothes. Then he came back to scoop her up like a tiny bird and carry her to his guest bedroom. He tucked her in gently. It felt strange, but somehow natural. Natasha's little hands unconsciously searched for something. Finding nothing, they hugged the blanket instead. Voider found himself making a mental note to buy her a plushie. Which is crazy because he never liked plushies. They're just soft little things that can do nothing for you, what's the big deal about them?

When she woke up the next day, Voider was already in the kitchen. He had made himself a strong black coffee and was sipping it leaning against the counter when she walked in, her pigtails hanging loose, rubbing her eyes and waddling barefoot. Voider put his coffee down, like a reflex, like it was liquor or something. Though to be fair, the way he takes his coffee, you might as well call that liquor. He crouched down. ""Morning, Natasha... So... I sent your dad away last night, but I couldn't find the other guy. Vasily, right?"" She nodded. ""I wanted to ask you about him when I got back but you were asleep... But don't worry, I'll find him. Just don't go back home for now..."" Voider paused, then held her shoulder. ""What's your plan now?"" Natasha scrunched her little nose and contemplated for a while ""I will... I could... Sell lemonade and make some money! And buy a house!"" Voider held back a laugh. ""Very clever, Natasha!"" He chuckled shortly. Then he took a deep breath and stood up, looking out of the window. The day was just breaking. Birds were stretching their wings about, clouds rehearsing their dance. He looked back at the little girl's face. ""Malyshka..."" He called softly. Little one. It somehow slipped easily from his tongue. ""Do you want to stay here? Let me be your new papa?"" He said softly. The softest he has ever spoken in his life. There was a weight in his chest that he ignored. ""Okay... I'll stay with you until mama gets back from her trip to heaven"" Natasha swayed from side to side. Voider felt like something was choking him. He let out a shuddering breath. He nodded and reached out to touch her hair. His hand was slightly trembling. Something that has never happened before. He hated how many first time things have been happening since this little girl came into his life. He touched her hairtie which was hanging loose, her hair all frizzy and disheveled from sleep. He stood up. ""I'll make you some breakfast and let's go out, mm? Get you some new clothes and all?"" Natasha smiled and nodded happily.

He took her to a mall and she immediately started pointing at everything sparkly and cute. She wrapped her small fingers around his index finger as she walked through all the aisles, sometimes skipping. He bought her pretty dresses and shoes, some hair accessories and other things like a kids' toothbrush and small cutlery. While she was looking through hairclips with bows on them, a woman approached her and crouched down. ""Sweetie your hair is all loose, love..."" The woman showed her the hairtie that fell off her hair. Voider stepped beside Natasha. The woman looked up at him. ""Are you her dad?"" He froze. His chest tensed up slightly. ""Why?"" He managed to choke out. ""Well look at her hair!"" Voider sighed with frustration. Being judged by some random woman now because of this little thing? Great. Just wonderful. ""Watch now"" the woman took it upon herself to demonstrate how to tie up hair. ""Like this... I swear you can't leave kids with their dads or they come out looking like they were living inside a cave"" the woman shook her head. ""Now you do the other side"" Voider sighed and crouched down, and decided to give it a go. It took him a few tried but he pulled it off. The woman nodded appreciatively. Natasha smiled and jumped, making the pigtails bounce.

On their way out, Natasha suddenly stopped, hopping up and down and pointing at a store window. He stopped to look. The store display was full of giant plushies and stuffed toys. He followed her lead as Natasha pulled him inside by his index finger. He looked around at all the fluffy animals. She pointed at a big teddy bear. A brown fluffy one that's almost double her size. The salesman pulled it down from the shelf and leaned down to show it to her. ""You like the papa bear plushie?"" He asked. Natasha nodded with a big smile. Watching that made something melt inside Voider. Suddenly he wanted to buy her all the plushies in the world. Natasha held the teddy bear and it engulfed her small figure. He could only see her little hands on the sides and her feet poking out under. He chuckled. He leaned down and took it from her. ""Bill that"" he handed it to the salesman.

Natasha joyfully skipped through the mall as they walked out together. Voider's usual hyper vigilance was failing him due to his attention being focused on the little girl, because otherwise, he would've noticed the eyes that followed them both from the other side of the mall.",1,1759473148.0,u_Razmik_raz,0,1.0,False

ACT ONE: THE STATIC

September 5, 2025 - The White House Residence - Evening

President Donald Trump, 79, sits in the blue-gray light of six television screens, a silent king in a court of ghosts. The air in the residence is still and heavy, thick with the scent of old paper and the low, constant hum of the mansion’s life support. Outside the bulletproof windows, the Washington Monument is a pale needle against a bruised twilight sky, and beyond it, just visible over the horizon, one of the Towers stands impassive and immense. It has been there for six years, a silent visitor from an unknown place, its surface rippling with colors that have no name. Like all the others across the globe, it does nothing. It simply is.

On the largest screen, Fox News is a fever dream of past and present. A segment on Portland, Oregon, shows fires, federal agents, and chaos. The graphics say ""Portland"" and ""Now,"" but the fire is old, from 2020. The chaos is a memory. The peaceful, present-day protesters are almost invisible, ghosts in their own story.

Trump leans forward, his reflection a pale, indistinct smudge on the screen. “It’s happening again,” he whispers to the empty room. “The fires. The riots.” He turns to an aide who stands by the door, a young man who has learned the art of being human furniture. “Do you see? It’s just like before.”

The aide nods. He has seen the internal memos. He knows what happens to those who contradict the screen.

Trump picks up his phone, his thumb moving slowly across the glass. He looks back at the television, then at the aide. “This is now, right? They’re saying now.”

“Yes, sir,” the aide says, his voice a quiet, neutral hum.

“We did something about this before,” Trump says, his voice a dry rustle of leaves. He walks to the window, his movements slow and careful, as if navigating a dream. He looks out at the silent Tower, a colossal, sleeping god in the distance. “We sent the military. It worked. That was good.” He turns back to the aide, his eyes unfocused. “We should do that again. The same thing. What we did.”

ACT TWO: THE ECHO

September 27, 2025 - Morning

A post appears on Truth Social at 6:47 AM, a digital whisper that will soon become a storm: “Portland is under SEIGE by ANTIFA terrorists! Worse than ever! Fires everywhere! We will use FULL FORCE like we did before. STRENGTH!”

At the Pentagon, the message arrives not as an order, but as a tremor. Generals and admirals, men and women who have spent their lives in a world of clear directives and hard facts, now find themselves navigating a landscape of shadows and echoes. There is no intelligence briefing. No threat assessment. Only a post.

At 11 AM, Oregon’s Governor, Tina Kotek, receives a call. She is in her office in Portland, a city of quiet streets, open coffee shops, and joggers on the waterfront. She has crime statistics, police reports, and live-camera feeds ready to share.

“Mr. President,” she begins, “I want to assure you that Portland is…”

“I’m watching it right now,” Trump interrupts. His voice is thin, distant, like a voice on a fading radio broadcast. “The fires. Terrible fires. Like a war. Portland has fires now. I’m looking at it.”

“Sir,” Kotek says, her voice slow and clear, as if speaking to a sleepwalker. “What you may be seeing is older footage. There is no insurrection in Portland. The protests are small and peaceful.”

There is a long pause on the other end of the line. When Trump speaks again, his voice is small, vulnerable, a child lost in the dark. “Am I watching things on television that are different from what’s happening? My people tell me different. Or maybe…did I see this before? Did this happen before?”

The call ends. Kotetok stares at her phone, the quiet hum of a functioning city outside her window. She realizes that she is not in a political disagreement. She is in a conversation with a ghost, a man haunted by a television screen.

September 28, 2025

The memo arrives, a ghost in the machine. 200 Oregon National Guard members, federalized. A sixty-day deployment to a war that exists only in memory.

ACT THREE: THE GATHERING OF SLEEPWALKERS

September 30, 2025 - Quantico Marine Base

Hundreds of generals and admirals fill an auditorium, a silent sea of stars and medals. They have been summoned from across the world, pulled from their posts without explanation. They wait. In the distance, through the large windows of the auditorium, another of the alien Towers can be seen, a silent, patient observer of human folly.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a man who seems more like a television host than a public servant, takes the stage. “The era of the Department of Defense is over,” he announces. “We are now the Department of War.”

He speaks of fat generals and beardos, of looking like soldiers for the cameras. The generals sit in stunned silence, their faces impassive masks.

Then Trump enters. The room stands, a silent, disciplined reflex. He moves slowly, his suit unbuttoned, his steps a careful shuffle. He looks out at the silent room, a sea of faces he no longer seems to recognize.

“I’ve never walked into a room so silent before,” he says, his voice a low murmur. He loses his train of thought, staring out at the crowd. “Don’t laugh. You’re not allowed to do that. Just have a good time.”

He speaks of Portland, of fires that no one else can see. He talks about walking down stairs, a long, rambling discourse on the fear of falling. He speaks of the Department of War, a name he loves because it is a “beautiful word.” He speaks of using American cities as training grounds for the military. “Because some of them, like Portland, they already look like war zones. So why not? Why not train there?”

He tries to remember a phrase, something about “kingdom come,” but the words escape him. “Kingdom,” he says, the word hanging in the air, an empty vessel. “Kingdom…the place. The coming. Kingdom come. That’s it. Kingdom come. We blew them to kingdom come.” But he didn’t say it the first time. His brain, like an old, failing machine, could not retrieve the data. Everyone in the room noticed.

He ends his speech by looking out at the generals, at the thousands of stars on their uniforms. “So many stars,” he says, his voice a whisper. “How many stars? Must be thousands. Thousands of stars.” He seems to be counting the rank insignia as if they were literal stars in the night sky, distant and cold and beautiful.

He shuffles off the stage, his hand gripping the rail as he navigates the three steps down to the floor. The generals and admirals watch in silence, their faces unreadable. They have just been told to prepare for a war that does not exist, by a man who can barely walk, a man who has confused the stars on their shoulders with the heavens.

ACT FOUR: THE SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY

October 1, 2025 - Portland, Oregon

The National Guard troops arrive in a city that is not at war. They find coffee shops opening, joggers on the waterfront, morning commuters biking to work. They find a small protest of maybe 30 people with signs.

They take up their positions, guarding a federal building from people having picnics. They are soldiers in a dream, fighting a phantom enemy.

But their presence is not a dream. It is a reality. And it creates a new reality. The protests grow, no longer about the original cause, but about the military occupation itself. A small scuffle breaks out. Police respond. The news cameras arrive.

In the White House, Trump watches the coverage. The screen shows troops, and now, real protesters, angry and shouting. The footage is mixed with the old, fiery images from 2020. It is impossible to tell what is now and what is then.

“See?” Trump says to his Chief of Staff. “I was right. I told you it was bad. Everyone said I was wrong, but I was right. Like I always am.”

The loop is complete. The dream has become real. The television is now telling the truth, a truth that it created.

ACT FIVE: THE SILENT ROOM

Quantico - Later

In the officers’ quarters, two generals sit in the dark. The Tower is visible through their window, a silent, colossal silhouette against the dawning sky.

“Did that really happen?” one asks.

“What part?”

“All of it. Being called fat. Being told a name change stops wars. Being told to occupy Portland because it ‘looks like a war zone.’”

Silence.

“He couldn’t remember the phrase ‘kingdom come.’ Just stopped mid-sentence.”

More silence.

“And we’re doing it anyway. We’re sending troops based on…on television.”

“Based on television from five years ago.”

“Does he know it’s from five years ago?”

“I don’t think he knows what year it is.”

They sit in the dark, two men with decades of military service, with advanced degrees in strategic planning, with combat experience. They are two of the most powerful men in the world, and they are helpless.

“What do we do?”

“We follow orders.”

“Even when—”

“Especially when.”

They look out the window at the Tower, a silent, impossible thing that has been there for six years, a thing they have learned to live with, a thing that has become part of the landscape. It is a mystery, but it is a harmless mystery. It is not like the mystery that now sits in the Oval Office, a man who is the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world, a man who is lost in a dream from which he cannot wake, a dream that he is now making real for everyone else.

The Tower is silent. The generals are silent. The world holds its breath, waiting to see if anyone will dare to break the silence, to say the unsayable: the emperor is not well, the king is sundowning, and the world is in his hands.

But no one does. The silence holds. The dream continues. And in Portland, the soldiers stand their watch, guarding a city that is not at war, waiting for an enemy that will never come, an enemy that is already here, in the heart of the machine, in the mind of the king.

And the Towers, silent and patient, watch it all, dreaming their long, slow dreams of whatever comes next.

1nwrl1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhStartups/comments/1nwrl1c/10_startup_ideas_that_will_fail_if_you_start_in/,10 startup ideas that will fail if you start in 2025 in the Philippines,"In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhStartups/comments/1nq5vhk/why_arent_there_any_filipino_startups_like_shopee/), I asked why isn’t there an e-commerce platform like Lazada and Shopee founded and funded in the Philippines, today. Madaming nag attempt, pero walang nag survive.

Alot of comments mentioned that both platforms only recently became profitable, and it seemed like the consensus is that a Filipino startup must be profitable within 3 years. Longer than that and funding usually runs out.

There were a lot of good insights in that thread, which got me thinking, what other startup ideas won’t work in the Philippines, especially if you start it in 2025?

So here’s my list:

1. **E-commerce Platforms**: *Lazada, Shopee*. Among other reasons listed in my previous post, I believe a big factor is the late role out of internet infrastructure in our country nationwide compared to SG and China, thus putting their startups in a better position to come in and dominate than Filipino e-commerce startup attemps, since mas late naging familiar ung majority ng population natin sa internet, online payment, and online shopping. So if you’ll attempt a new e-commerce platform in 2025, even niche once, I don’t see it. 
2. **Website Builders**. *SquareSpace, Wix, Smugmug, Wordpress dot com*. If you’re doing business in the Philippines a facebook page and listings on facebook marketplace is a must. Websites are nice-to-have but the masang pinoy are not comfortable using websites. Mas gusto nila chat lng sa FB or Viber or go thru Lazada or Shoppee. So if gagawa ka ng SquareSpace competitor targeting Filipino business, I doubt you’ll get users. But maybe if you make a better service than SquareSpace and target the international market, who knows?
3. **Movie Streaming**. There was already *Iflix*, and of course recently *Vivamax* has been very successful with a subscriber count of [11 million](https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2024/06/01/2359433/vivamax-hits-11-million-subscribers-sees-overseas-growth), each paying 169 pesos a month totaling to 1.859 BILLION pesos in monthly revenue. I’m don’t know how much they spend on storage space, bandwidth, and film production, but I’m assuming they’re already profitable. I think the reason for their success was that they filled the void of Filipino R-18/bomba content which was a staple in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. [In 2004, SM Malls banned ](https://www.philstar.com/news-commentary/2004/08/30/263110/sm-cinemas-lauded-ban-r-18-films)R-18 movies in their cinemas, and online and CD piracy put a nail to the coffin for that genre. In the 2010s virtually 0 bold films were produced until Vivamax came during the pandemic. If you do the same exact thing they’re doing, I don’t see you taking market share from them. 
4. **Blockchain**. I originally had a more pessimistic take on this. But [the DPWH just signed an agreement](https://www.rappler.com/philippines/dpwh-blockchain-council-integrity-chain/) with a local blockchain last Oct 1. Sen. Bam Aquino has also filed [senate bill 1330 National Budget Blockchain Act](https://web.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2025/0902_aquino1.asp). I watched the full [senate hearing last Oct 2](https://www.youtube.com/live/4Z6f-d4MRmY?si=fA6NuMtVYLJtyXBc), and I think very promising for local blockchain startups. If the bill is passed into law, there could be a strong demand from various government agencies and the private sector for blockchain providers. But if you start in 2025, is it too late?
5. **Payment Solution**. *Gcash* and *Maya*. Okay this is debatable if they can even be considered a startup since they are both attached to telcos. My personal opinion, the Gcash team within Globe still had a startup mindset and their efforts since the 2000s put them in a position to be the default payment solution during and after the pandemic. Now, even PayMaya gave up and rebranded to just Maya, leaving Gcash alone and ubiquitous. So if you start your own Venmo in 2025, it’s going to be a steep uphill battle.
6. **Micro Business.** An app targeting sari-sari store owners, farmers, small hardware stores, talyer, fishball vendors, etc. Okay so eto dapat sana ung quintessential market mo kung pinoy startup ka. Kaso conservative ang mga yan on trying new tech, and ultimately wala silang pang bayad sayo kahit panong monitization ang gawin mo. So I doubt you’ll make profit in 3 years. Anybody here successfully monetize this niche?
7. **Messaging apps**: *Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram*. Viber entered the Philippines around 2014/15, and started aggressive marketing including physical brand activations events. They had mall shows and to enter, you had to make a group chat in the app and send a sticker. It was a new thing, fb messenger didn’t even have a group chat function yet at that point. Viber sponsored a lot of EDM-festival events, concerts, the week long laboracay parties (pronounced as lay-boracay, portmanteau of labor day + Boracay because it takes place during Labor Day weekend). With all of their efforts, Viber became the default number-based messaging app in the country with WhatsApp and Telegram getting their own Filipino market shares organically, albeit smaller, in the years that followed. Along with FB messenger, the space is too saturated already. 
8. **Professional sports** related: An app that does stats tracking, roaster management, salary tracking, or play calling. Very very small ang professional sports sa Pinas. If gusto mo gumawa ng passion project para sa barangay liga niyo, feel free to do so, pero don’t expect to turn any profit. But to be fair I don’t think may successful n gantong app kahit sa US.
9. **Dating** **apps**. *Bumble, Tinder, Coffee Meets Bagel, Grindr, adultfriendfinder, CatholicMatch, facebook dating*. I’m in my 30s already. 10 years ago nakaka-kuha ako ng dates, pero lately hindi. I don’t have statistics pero feel ko ung mga pinoy gen z hindi pa rin “gets” kung pano ung mga dating apps. Pag may nakaka match ako parang di gets nung ka match ko n dapat na kaming mag date or leading towards a date. Parang okay mag match, chat onti tapos wala na. (Or baka naman pangit lng ako talaga at ako ung problema? 😂) Nonetheless I doubt you’ll get enough users and make profit in 3 years.
10. **Livestream apps**. *Kumu* and *Bigo* tried during the pandemic. I don’t actually know how they’re doing right now, pero di ko n sila nadidinig. I think for live streamers who are more interested in making money than building themselves as an entertainer, yung Yellow Basket system of Tiktok is really a great system since may commission from sales agad. [In my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyVloggers/s/yI6y8ucHjS) in r/pinoyvloggers someone said they can easily do Php50k in a month thru Tiktok Yellow Basket especially pag ber months na. To earn sa mga livestream apps, you’re basically begging for donations from your viewers, which, given na low income country tayo, I don’t know of any full time content creator in the Philippines that survives mainly on livestreaming. So if you start your own platform, I doubt you’ll make profit in 3 years if you start today.

What do guys think of this list?

Do you agree or disagree with some?

Do you consider some of the ideas I mentioned, not a startup?

What other ideas do you think won’t work in the Philippine market?

What ideas do you think have the best chance of turning a profit in 3 years?",0,1759472756.0,PhStartups,1,0.5,False
1nwrkud,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nwrkud,Quick Revision: Indian Climate,"# Factors Influencing India's Climate

* **Location & Latitude:** The Tropic of Cancer divides India into tropical and sub-tropical zones.
* **Himalayan Mountains:** Act as a climatic divide, blocking cold Central Asian winds and forcing monsoon winds to shed rain.
* **Distribution of Land & Water:** Differential heating creates pressure differences, driving monsoons.
* **Altitude & Relief:** Western Ghats cause orographic rain.
* **Upper Air Circulation:** Crucial role of Jet Streams.

# The Indian Monsoon Mechanism

* **Classical Theory:** Differential heating of land and sea.
* **Modern Theory (Key Factors):**
   * **Shift of Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ):** Northward shift in summer creates a low-pressure monsoon trough over the Gangetic plains.
   * **Sub-Tropical Westerly Jet Stream (STWJ):** Blows over North India in winter. Its withdrawal north of the Himalayas is crucial for monsoon onset.
   * **Tropical Easterly Jet Stream (TEJ):** Develops in summer due to intense heating of the Tibetan Plateau. It strengthens the monsoon.
   * **Mascarene High:** A high-pressure area in the southern Indian Ocean from where monsoon winds originate.

# The Four Seasons of India

**1. The Cold Weather Season (Winter / Dec-Feb)**

* Clear skies, low temperatures. Sun is in the Southern Hemisphere.
* Prevalent winds are offshore (land to sea), hence dry.
* **Western Disturbances:** Cyclonic depressions from the Mediterranean Sea cause light rain in North-West India ('Mahawat'), beneficial for Rabi crops (wheat). STWJ brings them to India.
* Some rainfall on the Tamil Nadu coast from North-East Monsoon winds picking moisture from the Bay of Bengal.

**2. The Hot Weather Season (Summer / Mar-May)**

* Apparent northward movement of the sun. Intense heating of land.
* Development of a strong low-pressure trough in North-West India.
* **Local Storms:**
   * **Mango Shower:** Pre-monsoon showers in Kerala/Karnataka, help in ripening of mangoes.
   * **Blossom Shower:** In Kerala, good for coffee blossoms.
   * **Nor'westers (Kal Baisakhi):** Thunderstorms in Bengal and Assam, beneficial for tea, jute, and rice.
   * **Loo:** Hot, dry, strong local winds over North India.

**3. Advancing Monsoon (South-West Monsoon / Jun-Sep)**

* Caused by intense low pressure over North India attracting moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean.
* Sudden onset is called 'burst' of the monsoon.
* **Two Branches:**
   1. **Arabian Sea Branch:** Strikes Western Ghats first (causing heavy orographic rain on windward side), then moves to Mumbai, Gujarat, and central India.
   2. **Bay of Bengal Branch:** Strikes Myanmar coast and deflected by Arakan Hills towards India. Causes heavy rain in NE India (Mawsynram). Moves up the Gangetic plains, rainfall decreases from east to west.
* **Monsoon Breaks:** Dry spells during the rainy season.

**4. Retreating Monsoon (North-East Monsoon / Oct-Nov)**

* Low-pressure trough weakens and shifts southwards.
* Clear skies and rise in temperature, leading to oppressive weather known as 'October Heat'.
* Main rainfall season for the Tamil Nadu coast and southern Andhra Pradesh.
* Associated with the formation of tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal which often strike the East Coast.

# ENSO and the Indian Monsoon 

El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and air pressure across the equatorial Pacific Ocean.

|Aspect|El Niño|La Niña|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Pacific Ocean**|Warm pool in East Pacific|Cold pool in East Pacific|
|**Trade Winds**|Weak trade winds|Strong trade winds|
|**India Monsoon**|Weak monsoon|Strong monsoon|

* **Normal Conditions (Walker Circulation):** Strong trade winds blow westwards, piling up warm water in the Western Pacific (near Australia). Cold, nutrient-rich water upwells along the Peruvian coast (Eastern Pacific). This leads to a Low Pressure over Western Pacific and High Pressure over Eastern Pacific.
* **El Niño (Warm Phase):**
   * **Event:** Abnormal warming of the Central and East Pacific Ocean.
   * **Mechanism:** Trade winds weaken or reverse. Upwelling stops off the Peruvian coast. Warm water shifts eastward.
   * **Impact on India:** Correlated with a weak monsoon and drought-like conditions. Disrupts the normal pressure patterns.
* **La Niña (Cool Phase):**
   * **Event:** Abnormal cooling of the Central and East Pacific Ocean.
   * **Mechanism:** An intensification of the normal conditions. Trade winds become stronger.
   * **Impact on India:** Correlated with a strong monsoon and above-average rainfall.

**Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)**

* **Positive IOD:** Warmer than normal sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea) and cooler in the east. Favourable for the Indian monsoon.
* **Negative IOD:** Reverse conditions. Warmer in the eastern Indian Ocean and cooler in the west. Unfavourable for the Indian monsoon.",3,1759472736.0,SavalAI,0,1.0,False

My name is JP, and I'm a 41-year-old writer in the GMT-5 time zone. I am looking for female or female-identifying writing partners who are 18 years of age or older.

While I don't have specific plots in mind, I am a big fan of romance, slice-of-life (SOL), and science fiction. I've also recently developed an interest in fantasy settings. I typically write 2-4 paragraphs per post but am happy to match my partner's length. I prioritize quality over quantity in my writing.

I have been roleplaying for about 20 years, starting in the classic Yahoo chatrooms.

For platform and style, I prefer writing in the third-person past tense on Discord. I am primarily looking for original character (OC) pairings.

Here are some fandoms that I enjoy and can draw inspiration from:

Anime:

While I don't watch a lot of anime, I've been craving a plot similar to ""My Senpai is Annoying."" I'm drawn to the dynamic of coworkers who initially find each other bothersome but grow closer over time, becoming indispensable to one another. The humorous commentary from their colleagues is also a fun element I'd be interested in exploring.

Video Games:

Stardew Valley Cyberpunk 2077 Baldur’s Gate 3 Horizon series Coffee Talk 1 & 2

Movies/TV:

Blade Runner Star Trek (Prime Timeline) - As a huge fan, I am open to a wide variety of plots within this universe.

The plots we create can be entirely original while still utilizing inspiration from any of these sources. I'm a fan of many other things as well, so please feel free to send me a direct message with your ideas or any questions you might have about potential plots or other shows I might enjoy.",1,1759472445.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

Yesterday I came home after 1,5hrs overtime in work and then went grocery shopping so I came home much later than usual. Aurelion was sleeping on his floating wood log on the other half of the aquarium and the moment he noticed me, he literally sprinted towards me. He was so excited to see me, wiggling, flaring and even doing spins. 
Safe to say he is familiar with me now 🤣
Yes I will take out the Spongebob deco in the future but it's the shrimps' java moss filled home right now 🤣",2,1759472230.0,bettafish,0,0.76,False
