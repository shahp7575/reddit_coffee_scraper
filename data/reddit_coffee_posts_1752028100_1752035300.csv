1lv9mpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1lv9mpa/do_carpet_cleaning_companies_move_furniture/,Do carpet cleaning companies move furniture?,"As someone who's worked in professional carpet cleaning for over 8 years, I've noticed this question comes up a lot. Let me break down what you can actually expect when hiring a carpet cleaning company.

Most carpet cleaning companies will move lighter furniture like coffee tables, chairs, and small items. However, they typically won't move heavy pieces like beds, dressers, entertainment centers, or pianos. This is mainly for liability reasons and to protect their workers from injury.

I learned this the hard way when I first started my own cleaning business. Moving heavy furniture can lead to damaged items, injured workers, and costly insurance claims. That's why most companies now have clear policies about what they will and won't move.

If you want a thorough carpet cleaning under all your furniture, you have two options:

1. Move the heavy items yourself before the cleaners arrive
2. Clean the accessible areas only and leave the furniture in place

Here's what I've found works best: Get yourself a good carpet cleaner machine for regular maintenance. I personally use one I found on Amazon (https://explorehomedeals.com/Carpet-Cleaner) - it's perfect for cleaning under furniture because you can easily maneuver it yourself without worrying about liability issues.

What professional companies typically WILL move:
- Dining room chairs
- Coffee tables
- End tables
- Floor lamps
- Small ottomans
- Lightweight furniture

What they typically WON'T move:
- Heavy appliances
- Beds and mattresses
- Large dressers
- Entertainment centers
- Pianos
- Antique furniture
- Heavy bookcases
- Electronic equipment

Pro tip: If you're planning to hire a cleaning service, ask about their furniture moving policy during booking. Some companies charge extra for furniture moving, while others flat-out refuse to move certain items.

For maintaining your carpets between professional cleanings, I highly recommend getting your own carpet cleaner. I've found this one on Amazon (https://explorehomedeals.com/Carpet-Cleaner) to be particularly effective for regular maintenance. It's saved me hundreds on professional cleaning services.

Remember to always clear the area as much as possible before any carpet cleaning - whether you're doing it yourself or hiring professionals. This ensures the best possible results and prevents any potential issues with furniture damage or worker injury.

The bottom line is: don't assume carpet cleaners will move everything. Always check their policies beforehand and be prepared to move heavy items yourself or leave them in place. Your best bet is combining professional services for deep cleaning with regular maintenance using your own carpet cleaner.",1,1752034990.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1lv9lqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1lv9lqu/the_divorce_is_ready_my_exhusband/,"The Divorce is Ready, My Ex-Husband","“I’m agreeing to your marriage offer now,” I said into the phone, my voice barely steady. “Just… hurry up and pick me.”

There was a pause. Then his deep, confused voice came through. “You’re agreeing now? After rejecting it before? What about Clinton?”

“I’m divorcing him,” I said firmly. “So if you still want to marry me, come get me in a week.”

I hung up before I could hear his answer, hands shaking as I clutched the ultrasound — the last piece of the baby I lost in that crash my half-sister caused. She lied about it, blamed me, and my own father spat hate at me instead of asking if I was even okay. And what’s worse? She was pregnant with my husband’s child.

I overheard Clinton, too: “Marrying her was a mistake. But don’t worry — at the birthday party, I’ll slip something in her drink, set her up. He’ll think she was cheating. Then I’ll be rid of her for good.”

That was the final straw. On the day of my the party, I gave them my last gift — my signed divorce papers and my wedding ring. Then, leave them. But, as I prepare to marry the man who truly loves me, Clinton crawls back, begging for another chance.

\--

“I’m agreeing to your marriage offer now,” I said into the phone, my voice barely steady. “Just… hurry up and pick me.”

There was a pause. Then a deep, confused voice replied on the other end, “You’re agreeing now? After rejecting it before? What about Clinton?”

“I’m divorcing him,” I said firmly. “So if you still want to marry me, come pick me up after one week.”

I hung up before I could hear his response.

My hand trembled slightly as I lowered the phone. I sighed, not from relief—but from exhaustion. My body ached in places I couldn’t name, and my heart felt like it had been stitched together with pins and broken promises.

A soft knock at the door snapped me out of my thoughts. A nurse entered, offering me a gentle smile.

“You’re ready to be discharged, Miss Moore. Here’s the last scan from your check-up,” she said, placing a printed image into my hand.

It was the ultrasound of my baby—my last photo with the little soul I never got to meet.

I stared at the black-and-white image. Seven months. I was seven months pregnant when the accident happened. When I lost everything.

And it was Alynna’s fault. My half-sister. We were on our way home. She insisted on driving, even though she was clearly drunk. I told her to pull over. She didn’t listen. Then the headlights came out of nowhere.

Crash. Screams. Blood. Shattered glass.

When I woke up in the hospital, the baby was already gone.

But the worst part? Alynna lied. She told everyone I had been the one driving. That I was the one drunk. That the crash was my fault.

She pinned it all on me. My father didn’t even ask for my side of the story. He stormed into the hospital two days after the crash—red-faced, livid, and full of disgust.

“You’ve humiliated this family again,” he spat. “Your half-sister is injured because of you. Haven’t you done enough damage already?”

Not once did he ask how I was doing. Not once did he mention the baby. Not once did he look at me and see his daughter.

But then again, he never really did. He never loved me. Not even as a child. I was the reminder of everything he hated—of the woman he once married and lost.

He blamed me for my mother’s death. She died in a car accident too, trying to rush home from work when I had a fever. I was only eight, but he never forgave me, even after he married Alynna’s mother who was actually his mistress.

“She wouldn’t have died if it weren’t for you,” he had said once, in one of his quieter fits of anger. “You cursed everything you touched.”

No one stood by me. Not one soul came to ask how I was doing. Not after the miscarriage. Not after the surgery. Not even after I begged someone to call Clinton. But unfortunately, he was busy treating Alynna who was faking her injury.

It was in that silence I knew. I had to leave before they completely ruined me.

I grabbed my small duffel bag, filled with folded clothes and pills I could barely pronounce, and made my way down the hallway of the hospital.

But fate wasn’t finished with me yet. I heard it before I saw them—familiar voices just around the corner.

Alynna and Clinton.

I froze, pressing myself against the wall, heart pounding.

“What about Chloe?” Alynna said, her tone cautious. “She’s going to lose it once she finds out I’m pregnant.”

My breath caught.

“And why would she get mad?” Clinton replied, not even bothering to lower his voice. “Our baby died because of her. It was her fault you got into that accident and got hurt. He should be thankful that you’re giving me an heir.”

My mouth fell open. I gripped the ultrasound picture in my hand tighter, my nails cutting into the paper.

“Thankfully our baby is safe,” he continued. “And it’s not like I ever loved her.”

“She’s still your wife,” Alynna said, voice laced with something almost mocking. “If you don’t love her, why not just leave?”

“You know I can’t do that yet,” Clinton muttered. “My grandfather hates divorce, and he adores Chloe for some reason. Still don’t know why. Marrying her was a mistake from the beginning. But don’t worry…”

I leaned closer, nausea rising in my throat.

“…at my grandfather’s birthday party next week, I’ll slip something in her drink. Set her up with someone. Then my grandfather will have to believe she was cheating, and I’ll be rid of her for good.”

Laughter followed. Their laughter.

And then Clinton added, “Doctor said you’re already three months, right?”

“Three months,” Alynna confirmed, giggling. “Our little heir.”

I didn’t wait to hear more. I turned, walked down the hall with every ounce of dignity I had left, and stepped into the first cab I could find.

Tears blurred my vision, but I didn’t let them fall. Not yet.

I reached into my bag, pulled out my phone, and dialed a number I’d been avoiding for weeks.

“This is Chloe Rose Moore,” I said when the line picked up.

“Yes, ma’am?”

“I want to file for divorce,” I said. “Immediately.”

Chapter 2

“I want to file for divorce,” I said firmly, clutching my phone like a lifeline. “Immediately.”

A pause on the other end. “Mrs. Moore… under your marital contract, both parties—especially the families—must be involved. Your in-laws must approve.”

“I don’t care.” My voice didn’t waver. “Just draft the papers and send them to me. Whether they sign or not, I’ll find a way.”

And with that, I hung up.

The silence in the hallway felt heavier after that. I hadn’t even made it to the gates of our home before I already felt like a stranger in it.

The moment I stepped inside, I sensed something had changed. No one greeted me. No one asked how I was. The air was colder, stiffer. My room, the one that had always felt like mine even when nothing else did, had been emptied. The curtains were different. The bedcovers were replaced. My dresser was filled with someone else’s things.

Alynna’s. Panic rising in my chest, I opened the cabinet only to find my belongings boxed up and shoved into a corner. Dusty, neglected. As if I had already been erased.

I hurried outside, searching for someone—anything familiar—and stopped short when I saw the maid near the garden, standing beside a small flame. A pile of items fed the fire: old jewelry boxes, yellowed letters, delicate fabrics. Things that looked painfully familiar.

I ran to her. “What is this? What are you burning?”

She turned with a hesitant look. “Miss Alynna said to dispose of the old things from storage… These were marked as ‘unnecessary.’”

My stomach turned. “These belonged to my mother!”

Just then, Alynna appeared behind me, holding another box in her hands. “Oh good, you’re here. I was just about to tell them to burn this one too. Dad said we’re clearing out old junk for the renovations. Sentimental clutter just slows things down.”

I stepped forward, my hands trembling. “That’s not clutter. Those are my mother’s memories. You don’t get to decide what stays.”

Alynna gave me a flat smile. “She’s dead, Chloe. She’s not coming back. And let’s be honest—you were the reason she died, weren’t you?”

The sting of her words landed harder than the slap I gave her.

She burst out theatrically. “Oh God—did you just hit me?”

Clinton appeared then, footsteps sharp, face unreadable. “What’s going on?”

“She slapped me,” Alynna sniffled. “I was just trying to help. Chloe got upset about some old things. I didn’t mean to upset her…”

Clinton turned to me. “What’s your problem? She’s trying to help and you lash out like this?”

“They were my mother’s,” I said, barely able to raise my voice. “And she’s throwing them away like they mean nothing.”

“So what?” he snapped. “She’s gone. We’re moving forward.”

And there it was. The truth, out loud. He had already left me in his heart. Maybe he never truly stayed.

I couldn’t even argue. I was too tired to. Too empty.

But then the memories came rushing in—how it all started. Six years ago. Back when Alynna had left the country for school and left Clinton devastated. I had been there, a silent shadow, a friend, someone who offered him comfort when he was drinking and miserable. And in a single, foolish night… everything changed.

He proposed months later, saying he wanted something real. I believed him.

And then Alynna came back. And suddenly I wasn’t enough anymore.

Their affair started slowly—subtle glances, inside jokes. And then it wasn’t hidden at all. She told me herself, over wine one afternoon: “He was mine first. He’ll always be mine. You were just a substitute until I came back.”

I should’ve left then. But I stayed. For the baby. For a love that clearly didn’t exist.

“You’ve caused enough trouble,” my father’s voice boomed from the patio. “After everything, now you’re fighting with Alynna too? Haven’t you done enough?”

His words hit me like another slap. “You’re grounded. Go to your room and stay there. Don’t come out until you’ve learned your place.”

And so I was locked inside.

The hours passed slowly, the silence louder than ever. Laughter echoed from downstairs—the three of them living, celebrating, pretending I never existed.

I cried myself to sleep that night.

A day later, the door creaked open. Alynna stepped in, holding a tray of food. Her smile was cold and victorious.

“Eat up, sister. You must be starving. It’s been a day. You know your place now, right?”

I glared at her. “I don’t want anything from you.”

She tilted her head. “Suit yourself. But Clinton did say you looked pale. Wouldn’t want to worry anyone.”

I hesitated, my stomach churning. But hunger won over suspicion.

Minutes after I took a bite, I started to sweat. My throat closed. My skin began to itch. Then I knew.

Seafood. I was allergic.

I stumbled to the bathroom, clutching the wall, calling for help. No one answered.

I faintly heard Clinton’s voice from the hall. “What’s going on?”

“She didn’t like the food,” Alynna replied calmly. “She was screaming for no reason.”

“What? An ungrateful woman! You already cook for her and she’d say that? Let’s just leave her and have fun outside.”

The last thing I heard was their voices laughing before everything went black.

Chapter 3

I woke up to the sterile white of the hospital ceiling again. The smell of antiseptic was too familiar by now, as if even my lungs had learned to live with it.

A nurse leaned over, gently checking my vitals. “You’re awake,” she said softly, then sighed. “Chloe… this is the third time this month. I really think you should call someone. A family member. A friend? Or should we report this to the police?”

I gave her a faint smile, though it didn’t reach my eyes. “There’s no one left to call. And I’m okay, I’ll handle this myself.”

She hesitated, clearly unsure of how to respond. Then she nodded and quietly excused herself.

As soon as the door clicked shut, I turned to my phone resting on the side table. Notifications flashed across the screen. One, in particular, made my breath catch.

It was a message from Alynna.

There was a photo. A fresh one—Alynna curled up in Clinton’s arms, the two of them smiling like the world hadn’t just shattered around me. Like I hadn't just buried our baby. Like I didn't exist.

A second later, a video followed. I hesitated—my finger hovering—then tapped play.

It was them. In our room. My room.

Alynna giggling as Clinton pulled her close. His hands around her body. Her lips pressing to his as he lifted her onto the bed. And then—her calling his name like I never existed.

My throat tightened. My chest felt hollow.

Another message lit up my screen.

“Oops, I don’t think you were supposed to see that. But since you did—sorry. Clinton can’t come today. He’s… busy. With me. Don’t worry. You won’t die from a little food mishap, right?”

I stared at it for a long time. But I didn’t cry.

Not anymore.

Instead, I deleted the message and placed my phone face down. My heart felt strangely light—like it had been emptied out long ago, and now there was nothing left to break.

Moments later, the phone buzzed again. This time, it was from Nathan.

“Everything’s ready. Just give me the signal and I’ll pick you up. No more delays, Chloe.”

A lump formed in my throat.

“I’ll be there,” I typed back.

“You better be,” he replied. “I’m not going to let you waste your life with that man anymore.”

Nathan. The one I once rejected because I thought loyalty to Clinton mattered more than love. The one who waited anyway. The one who offered me an out.

It was time to take it.

Later that day, I was discharged. No one came to pick me up—not that I expected anyone to.

When I returned home, I headed straight to my room, only to find more of Alynna’s things in place of mine. Makeup scattered on my vanity. Her heels in my closet. Like I was already erased from the life I supposedly owned.

But I wasn’t staying long. I just had one final thing to do.

The divorce papers were inside my bag, freshly printed and ready. The only missing part was Clinton’s signature.

And as if the universe heard me, there he was at the dining table, buried under a stack of documents. He didn’t even look up.

“Bring me some coffee,” he muttered. “And sort through these. Just flip them when I’m done.”

I approached slowly, heart pounding, and slipped the divorce papers into the stack. When he reached for the pen, I flipped the page without blinking.

He signed. Just like that.

“Anything else?” he asked flatly.

“No,” I said quietly. “I’m not feeling well. I’ll rest after I cook.”

“Good,” he grunted. “Alynna’s craving something spicy. Don’t mess it up.”

I nodded and walked to the kitchen.

No more arguments. No more shouting. Just this one last performance before the curtain dropped on this life.

I chopped the vegetables in silence. The knife hitting the board was the only rhythm left in my heart.

Alynna walked in moments later. She leaned against the counter like she owned the entire house. “You’re still here?” she said, her voice sharp and smug.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t need to.

“I mean, why?” she pressed on. “Shouldn’t you be gone by now? Honestly, I thought I got rid of you already. You’re like gum on a shoe.”

I kept chopping, refusing to give her the satisfaction of a response.

Then she leaned closer and whispered, “Why are you still alive?”

That made me stop.

“I will be gone soon,” I said evenly. “You don’t have to worry about me anymore.”

A slow, wicked smile spread across her face. “Good. Be gone before I give him his heir. I don’t want you clinging to our lives like a ghost.”

She turned and walked out, heels clicking against the tile.

But what she didn’t know—what none of them knew—was that I was already gone.

All that remained now was my shadow.

Chapter 4

I was folding the last of my clothes into the suitcase when the door slammed open.

“What do you think you’re doing?” my father barked from the doorway.

I looked up slowly, calmly. “I’m going on a short trip. Just a few days by myself.”

His eyes narrowed, like he was waiting for me to flinch. “Did I say you could go anywhere? Have you forgotten you’re supposed to prepare for my birthday tomorrow?”

“I already did,” I said, quietly. “The venue is booked. The catering confirmed. I made sure everything was taken care of.”

“Oh, really?” he sneered. “Then why did the venue call just now threatening to cancel because someone failed to confirm the guest list?”

My lips parted, confused. I was certain everything was handled. But before I could speak, he cut me off.

“Useless,” he muttered. “Just like always.”

I stiffened.

Behind him, Alynna appeared with that sweet, soft voice of hers.

“Dad, please don’t get mad at her. She probably just forgot. It happens.” She turned to me with a smile. “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. You’ve done enough already.”

I looked at her. And in that moment, I knew.

She had sabotaged it. Again.

It had always been like this.

I remembered being ten when Alynna shattered one of our mother’s favorite porcelain vases. She looked me dead in the eyes, lip trembling, and cried, “Chloe pushed me!” Even as I stood there, frozen, hands tucked behind my back, our father stormed in and didn’t even ask. He grabbed me by the arm, yelling about how I was reckless, ungrateful—that I didn’t deserve anything in the house I broke.

A few years later, it was the entrance exam forms. I’d spent the night carefully filling them out for both of us. The next morning, hers were torn, mine untouched. She cried again—“Chloe must’ve switched them! She probably wanted to be the only one to pass!”

And again, he believed her.

He always did. Every broken thing. Every mistake. Every missed appointment or misunderstood chore—it was Chloe’s fault. Alynna was the golden one, even when she was cruel. She had the smiles, the charm, the lies dressed in silk. I was the stain on the family name.

And every time I tried to speak? I was silenced. Dismissed. So I stopped speaking. What was the point?

They left me in my room, like they always did, with nothing but my thoughts and my bag.

Just one more day, I reminded myself. Just tomorrow… and I’ll be gone.

The next morning was filled with noise. Decorations. Staff. Laughter.

Of course, Alynna was the star of the show. Everyone praised her for “fixing” the problem with the venue. No one even looked my way. My father, dressed in his finest, gave me a glance of disdain.

“For your punishment,” he said loudly, “you’ll be serving drinks tonight. Stay away from our table. I don’t want you embarrassing me.”

Then Clinton chimed in, already buttoning his cufflinks. “And give your necklace to Alynna. It matches her dress better.”

My fingers instinctively clutched the pendant at my throat—delicate, gold-plated, and worn from years of holding it close. My mother’s. The last thing she ever gave me before she died. My breath caught.

“No,” I said quietly, then louder, firmer. “No. This necklace is mine. It was my mother’s. It’s the only thing I have left of her.”

Alynna stepped forward, already in full performance mode. “It’s okay, Chloe,” she said in that sweet voice that always made people fall for her lies. “I didn’t know it was that important to you. I just thought… maybe I could wear it just for tonight. It would mean a lot—”

“It means everything to me,” I cut in. “You already took everything else.”

Clinton’s jaw tightened. “Don’t be dramatic.”

“I’m not being dramatic, I’m asking you to respect this. Just this one thing.”

Clinton strode over to me in two quick steps. “Fine. If you won’t hand it over…” He reached out, his hand curling around the chain. “Then I’ll take it.”

“Clinton, don’t—!”

He yanked.

The clasp snapped against the back of my neck, a sharp sting biting into my skin. I flinched, but I didn’t cry out. Not this time.

He tossed it to Alynna like it meant nothing.

“It looks better on her anyway,” he said flatly.

They all walked out without me. I was truly done.

Later that evening, when the last car rolled down the driveway and the estate went quiet, I stood up from the bench outside the gate and walked to the back garage. My suitcase was already packed. The limousine I’d arranged with Nathan was waiting.

I handed my old house key to the mailman at the gate, along with a sealed envelope.

Inside it: the divorce papers, the wedding ring, and a thick folder of evidence—proof of every lie Alynna had told, every mistake she blamed on me, and every time I took the fall.

As I slid into the back seat of the limousine, my phone buzzed.

It was Clinton.

“Where the heck are you? The party started. My grandfather’s asking where you are. Don’t you dare ruin this for me. Get here now and be a good wife.”

I stared at the screen for a second. Then, with a steady hand, I typed:

“I’m no longer your wife. So enjoy the party. I already sent you my goodbye gift, my dear ex-husband.”

I hit send. Turned my phone off. And watched as the gates closed behind me.

I am the shadow that walks the hallways while you sleep.
Silent as regret, carved in secrets I keep.
I step through the doors, begin the walk—
No need for words, no time for talk.

Fluorescent flicker, vending hum,
The day is gone, the night has come.
I trade the noise for muted tone,
Where whispers echo, and I roam alone.

I know the rhythm of your midnight breath,
The twitch of your feet, the scent of death.
Not here to judge, nor here to save,
Just marking time between cradle and grave.

A call light blinks like a ticking bomb,
The halls stay quiet, but never calm.
I pass the rooms where secrets lie,
Where some hang on, and some say goodbye.

The Code came fast, with fists and fear—
I stepped in close, and drew in near.
No thanks required, no glory sought,
I do the work that must be wrought.

I walk the grounds beneath the moon,
Where shadows stretch and endings loom.
Out by the dock, the silence sings,
And something waits with ragged wings.

The coffee’s cold, the air sits still,
This kind of peace can feel like chill.
The world outside keeps dreaming on,
While I hold watch until it’s gone.

The sun returns with quiet grace,
Light crawls across this worn-out place.
I fade like mist, unseen, unnamed—
Standing proud, I have no shame.

I am the shadow that walks the hallways while you sleep.

A skill, a grinder, or a coffee?","My wife and I have been pulling shots for lattes and cortados about 10 years now. Started with a Breville infuser and bodum grinder. Stepped up to a Sette 270 after about 2 years. Then at 5 years we graduated machines to a Profitec Pro 700. Around the same time we added a Niche Zero alongside the Sette for pourover and decaf single dosing. Eventually we just turned the Niche into our daily grinder for everything. We have gotten to the point of where we feel like we are wanting more from our coffee; more nuance or something that we get from our good local coffee shops when we stop in, but we can't reproduce at home.

We have tried getting bags of what the shops are brewing and dialing them in at home. The ratios and timing that the shop tells us get dialed in well and repeatable, but there just doesn't seem like there is anything exciting in the cup. Tried some Proud Mary light roasts, everything got lost in the milk to where it just tasted like steamed milk in a cup with leftover coffee. Tried some Dark Matter and Andytown medium roasts, Mayorgas, Toby's Estate. Medium roasts just come out generic, but at least they have a flavor. So we've been riding the same medium roast for about 7 years now, consistently enjoyable for us, but we would like to get outside of our lines a bit more and experience at home what we experience in shops.

I know for a fact I'm not looking for a new machine. I'm trying to convince myself that I'm not in need of a flat burr grinder, because I'm trying to actively block an upgrade syndrome. So that leaves me to only criticize my technique. Perhaps there is more to hitting the checkboxes and adjusting accordingly, but I have no problem dialing a bag in for 18g:36-42g in 27-36 seconds. We use custom water, WDT, and controlled tamping. So perhaps I'm missing something in the nooks and crannies of technique.

What change did you do one day that you look back on and can point to as the moment your home espresso took a leap?

I need advice on how to be friends with my ex-girlfriend. For some context; We broke up around five months ago, because she did not really know herself outside of our relationship. I can totally understand that, as most of our friends referred to us as a whole, and I can admit both of us didn’t really have our own identities outside of “us.” I was fine with being us, and she wanted to be her, I get it. We moved away from our hometown for college and lived together, we even got a cat. Then she broke up with me, moved out, then the college year ended (I kept the cat, she is very lovely). I know I am young, but I thought we had that high-school sweethearts kind of love you hear about, we dated for three years total. The breakup blindsided me, I will admit.

The problem is we have the same friend-groups, some of which were originally my friends, some were hers. They are separate groups of two each, and I can say we each hang out with one group more, albeit separately (with originally my friend group). We haven’t hung out within this friend group but eventually it I think it will happen. They offered to not be her friend anymore, which I denied, and even encouraged them to stay friends with her. She is a very sweet girl, and I have nothing bad to say about her. We did try to hang out for a birthday dinner, to where I got too drunk in the restaurant, and she ended up driving me home, I told her I was still in love with her (yikes!), nothing happened, she cried, I cried, I puked around the corner, it was a whole thing. After that though, we did the adult thing and met up for coffee to discuss maturely (and soberly). We agreed that it’s obvious we can’t be friends right away so we took a friend-break, this happened two months ago. 

We have talked sporadically since that coffee talk, never without a reason. I drunk called her once, not my proudest moment, she was very understanding though. She does wonder why I never say anything bad about her even though she broke up with me, and the truth is I just can’t. She is a good person, and shes sweet and kind, I’m not blind, I know I hold her in very high regard. 

Truthfully, I’m not sure if I am entirely over her. I think about her a lot. When I hear songs, when I see cowboy boots, the usual. I developed hobbies and I talked about it. I walked around, I talk more, I took up journaling. She was my best friend though, she knew me more than myself, I knew her likewise. I’m taking small steps. I know I’m still very young, and maybe in a few years I won’t think about her this much, and it’s not the end of the world, but it is today. And it is what I think about today, and what I will think about tomorrow. 

My friend group is kind of like an inner circle, with my two friends, and me, or her interchangeably. But we also have an outer circle of seven friends total. We all go out to dinners, or outings, and one of these times I know we will both be invited. I’m not opposed to it, I think I  could be okay with it, but I am worried that it’ll end up like last time. I’m also kind of jealous, if she brings someone else into that outer-group, like a new boyfriend or something. I have no idea what I would do if that happened, but that’s a problem that hasn’t even happened yet. 

I don’t want to leave my friend group, and I don’t want to separate them from her either. How can I manage to have a friendship with her? Even if I am still (mildly) in love with her?

TLDR; Me and my ex-gf have the same friends, and we’d like to be friends with each other eventually. How can I be friends with her?

1lv9gmv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lv9gmv,"25M, USA, Spokane County","Hi! The name's Jack. I'm looking for gals to go on casual dates with for the purpose of pursuing something more serious (gotta get a good read on people before committing). I currently work for a non-profit in town as a donation pick up driver (yes, I see many, many cool things). At least, that's what it says I do on paper, but I do much more than just picking up donations.

I'm always up for a cup of coffee or going out for a drink and a good conversation is always an enjoyable accompaniment to that.

Some of my other interests include:
Hiking, backpacking/camping, hammocking, baking bread, watching really good movies that provide fantastic discussions (e.g. Shrek, Fiddler on the Roof, Peanut Butter Falcon) [bad movies such as Birdemic: Shock & Terror or Airplane vs. Volcano are also a pleasure], sword fighting, having long, solid talks with people, games (tabletop, RPG, and videogames), chess, folk/contra dances, and visiting museums and art galleries.

I'm a bit of a wandering soul, although not by choice. Grew up in China for ten years, then Canada for eight, and then made my way to the US. Never lived in any town longer than 5 years, although I'm hoping to beat my record here in Spokane. My parents were foreign workers in China. I myself grew up in a Baptist family. I made the choice to submit to God when I was in jr. high (summer of 2013), but had always accepted the faith of Christianity as a fact of life. I had a fairly significant deconstruction of my Baptist beliefs in 2023 and reconstruction into something different that I'm not sure how to put words to (not liberal theology just to make that clarification). I've been attending the Anglican church I am currently at for a short amount of time (less than a year), but I've found good people there, been able to have productive conversations about my beliefs there, and find much good health in the life of the Church.

Deal breakers for me are smoking (pipe tobacco and cigars are exceptions), weed, not wanting children in the future (I'd like to be a dad thanks), and having children of your own (but not be a dad that fast). I'd prefer to have a decent amount of crossover in interests, (3 shared interests/hobbies is ideal) and being able to be outdoors with other people is pretty important to me so it would be nice to meet someone who enjoys being outside.

Looking for people between 21-29 y/o. 

I'm willing to travel 3 hours in any direction from the general downtown Spokane area to meet. To help set some cardinal directions for time/distance limits, see below.
East: Missoula, MT
West: Wenatchee/Leavenworth, WA
North: Trail/Fruitvale/Rossland, BC, Canada (I have both my USA and CA Passports)

Headed out 8/1 from horseshoe meadows. Planning on taking 16 days, which I think should be within my capabilities. Haven't done a multi day trip besides a TRT segment a few years ago, but 15-20mi days felt leisurely on that trail (lots of breaks, late starts, etc.). Did one 27mi day which felt like a bit of a grind. No hard time limit I guess, but I don't plan on taking more than 20 days.I understand that once I hit the trail my plans are going to change from what I linked above.

The only fixed thing in my schedule is that for the first leg of the trip (HM -> whitney) is that I'll be doing it with some friends where they're doing a shorter trip, exiting whitney on 8/3 (day 3).

For resupplies, I plan on the following:

(Bold is where I am shipping myself stuff)

1. Starting with 4 days of food
2. **Mailing a box to independence and hitching from onion valley** with 4-5 days worth of food (enough to get to MTR/VVR), but 8 days of expensive things like liquid IV and coffee
   1. Despite the detour, people seem to really enjoy the scenery along kearsarge pass. Also, this avoids a heavy carry and expensive resupply at MTR.
3. MTR - hiker buckets for enough calories to VVR (one day)
4. VVR - buckets and general store if I can't get enough stuff at the MTR buckets to make it to RM
5. **Red's meadow** \- 3 days, enough to make it to the end.
   1. Maybe I should skip mailing a resupply here and just buy stuff from the general store (and mail myself even more coffee/liquid IV in independence)? My original plan was to take the bus into Mammoth and shop at the grocery stores there, but it might not work out with the new limited schedule.



Would also appreciate a shakedown :)

On the border of Federation space, in the near useless system Ur, you will find the space station TFSS Ascension. Ur has no habitable planets and little spaceborn industry to support the station. It had been just not financially feasible for private industry to invest this far away from any populous system.

The Federation built the station over a hundred years ago to support border defenses. It did not even have a name, just a number, DBS-10-1A. It was an unpopular posting. Those that got sent there referred to it as the ‘Ass End of the Federation.’ That evolved into Ascend Station. The Navy hated that name but could not stamp it out. So they altered it to Ascension, claiming it was named after Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean on Terra.

Ascension Island was garrisoned by the British and was an important refueling stop for ships and commercial airliners in the days of international air travel by flying boats. During World War II, it was an important naval and air station and provided a base for antisubmarine warfare. The similarities were enough that many people accepted the change with little argument or discontent.

When it was first built, it boasted a permanent squadron of only two cruisers, four light cruisers, six frigates, and twelve destroyers. The station housed a hundred fighters and twenty gunships. All told, it was an underwhelming naval force. Ascension’s defensive capabilities are somewhat impressive, but ultimately, without a large fleet presence, it was little more than a tripwire.

But in the last forty years things had changed. Its strategic military location was also a strategic transshipping location. Long haul shipping was a complex web of nodal orbital warehouses and transshipping ports. It was more cost effective to have ships run specific routes drop and pickup loads at these ports and return than to run from pickup to drop off points.

This empty chunk of space became an important hub for transshipping from Federation hulls to non-human ships. As such, it had developed into a large support infrastructure with thousands of cubic kilometers of warehouses and docking facilities, and very little was government owned.

The fleet defenses had expanded into a powerful task group totaling forty ships, the largest the *Audacious* class battle cruiser, TFN *Retribution*. but the economic benefits of the location meant all the local political entities had a stake in its continued prosperity. In all the years Ascension had existed, it had not once been attacked.

Under pressure from all the local star nations, especially the Confederation, even the Zygels and Vredeen stayed away. That was helped by the fact that multiple nations sent their own ships, sometimes flotillas up to seventy ships, to pass through the area on ‘friendly visits.’

This led to a unique situation in the system. While under Federation law, there were often forty or more sentient species in the system. Which meant that there were many opportunities for simple misunderstandings or disputes to escalate. It often resembled the old Wild West more than a modern space station. That meant the station security was not staffed entirely by humans.

Outside any local gravity well, the station was not limited to traditional designs. Most human space stations were long spindles with multiple rings connected by large spokes. Ascension Station was more like interconnected snowflakes. Many of the sections were owned and operated by private entities, both corporate and foreign governments. These foreign government-owned sections had been given unofficial embassy status, even if there were no real embassy personnel.

The station itself took up over five hundred chaotic cubic kilometers, and the system had an average of nine hundred every day. That meant system control had to be on the ball. Mistakes could lead to massive damages and loss of life.

The central command and control deck for the station was state-of-the-art, constantly manned with a hundred thirty-five-person crew. The large main holotank stood sixty meters tall and fifty in diameter and filled the center of the workspace. The central tank tracked incoming and outgoing vessels on a system scale.

Spaced evenly around it were twelve smaller holotanks, each twenty meters in diameter. Each of these twelve tanks were dedicated to a specific area of the station. They took over from the system control and guided ships into the docking ports of their assigned section.

Further out were fifteen other smaller tanks dedicated to the guidance of ships into the private ports. These stations handed over incoming ships to the private flight controllers only when they reached the designated space for the private docks and their accompanying orbital warehouses.

That was all the civilian space control. Military ships came under the military controllers who occupied a small deck above the civilian controllers. The military had final decision-making authority on any ship in the system and the firepower to back it up.

While the military had control over the local space, Customs Enforcement and the system’s local patrol cutters plied all through the local space, enforcing the laws as needed. Because, by law, the military cannot enforce Federation laws. There are some exceptions. The military can put down an insurrection, defend against any overwhelming forces that the civilian forces cannot handle, defend law enforcement or civilians under attack, and support law enforcement operations in a technical, transport, intelligence, or support role.

Needless to say, it is a complex soup with way too many chefs.

“Central Control, we got a Zecu'i'id merchie coming in asking permission to dock on the main arm, section C.” It was one of the inbound system controllers calling.

“C-3, confirm,” Mario Ybarra replied. “Inbound Zecu'i'id merchant ship for main arm. Pass it through.”

Division C handled all traffic to and from the station’s main docking arm. The main arm being five times as long as any other arm, it was divided into sections 1 through 5. Mario worked the third shift, and his main assignment was section three, though he could handle all five if needed.

The ship’s icon popped into his control station’s smaller holoscreen. From the trajectory, it had come in from the direction of the Ghenge Empire.

The ship’s name was unpronounceable by human vocal cords. Zecu’i’ish physiology was so different than humans. Their breathing and vocal apparatus was separate from their mouths and digestive system. Instead of vocal cords like many species, the Zecu’i’ish have a hollow structure that performs much like a flute. By opening and closing internal valves, they can create thousands of unique sounds. Their language is completely tonal, even into ranges humans cannot hear.

The ship’s tag showed the human translation, ‘*Eye of the Pale Flower in Moonlight Under a Cloudy Sky*.’ Humans had used other sentient’s languages, peoples who had interacted with the Zecu’i’id for hundreds to thousands of years, as a basis for translations.

“That’s a mouthful,” he mumbled. Luckily, he could use his primary link to easily translate for him.

“System Control to Zecu’i’id cargo ship, *Eye of the Pale Flower in Moonlight Under a Cloudy Sky.* Sending navigation waypoints now. Come to zeroes at waypoint Zulu. Confirm please.”

Coming to zeroes is the astro navigation term for zero velocity and zero rotation in the X, Y, and Z axes. It did not matter how many waypoints were set, waypoint Zulu is always the final waypoint in the navigation string.

“System Control, *Eye of the Pale Flower in Moonlight Under a Cloudy Sky* confirms. Starting navigation to waypoint Alpha. Come to zeroes at Waypoint Zulu. Estimated time to Point Zulu is nine hours, fifteen minutes.” The reply was an excellent mimicry of a female human’s speech. A melodic voice with a hint of huskiness.

“Your AI translator program is excellent. It almost sounds like I am talking to a human,” he said.

“That’s because it is not a translator. My name is Éadaoin, and I am human, from Acadia.”

“Well, my name is Mario, nice to meet you. I haven’t heard of humans being hired aboard Zecu’i’ish hulls.”

“It is becoming more commonplace. Hulls that interact with human territories are hiring people like me as translators and intermediaries because we understand humans and human activities. It pays well and I have seen a bunch of planets I’d never even known about.”

“Sounds fun. Are you unloading or transshipping any cargo?”

“Yes,” Éadaoin replied. “Full load of cargo inbound for Ascension station. Foodstuffs and supplies for several businesses on station, mostly non-human restaurants. List of cargo and destinations sent.”

“Gotcha. You are assigned docking bay C-3-12. I will have a customs inspection team meet you at the cargo unloading bays. Any personnel leaving your ship must submit proof of identification, medical paperwork, and consent to biosignature monitoring.”

“Why biosignature monitoring? I’ve never seen that before,” Éadaoin said. “When did this start?”

“The Federation is on a war footing. All traffic through Federation space is being closely monitored. All transshipments are being searched, and all non-Federation sentients are logged and tracked while on Federation planets or stations.”

“I see. And does this apply to ships docking in non-Terran controlled ports on Ascension?”

“Non-Terran sections, including all orbiting warehouses and stations are still subject to Federation laws. This whole system is Federation territory, no matter how much other sentients have invested in building their own infrastructure or industry. If you have anyone aboard that doesn’t want to be scanned, don’t let them off the ship. It’s that simple.”

When the ship did not reply, he continued, “I will continue to monitor your progress and check in if needed. Contact me if you need anything.”

“Affirmative, Control. *Eye of the Pale Flower in Moonlight Under a Cloudy Sky* clear.”

“I think she likes you,” The comment came from the station to his left. Jenna Elcyzyn was a close friend, if a bit inexperienced.                              

“Pfft. Get real, Jen. A two-minute audio conversation does not give anyone that feeling.”

“You should have switched to video,” she chuckled. “You know, haven’t seen a Zecu ship come through here before.

“It is a bit odd. The Empire is opposite side of Federation space from the Zecu’i’id Republic space. You’d expect that a Zecu’i’id ship would ply Zecu’i’id spacelanes. But there’s nothing illegal about it, as long as they are following all the laws and abiding by the trade agreements, they are golden.”

They were interrupted by their team lead, Charles Pfluger. “Flag that ship. Send a report up the chain. Send it to FIIS, customs and system patrol. Something feels off about it. I want someone to pay close attention to it.”

“Again?” Mario replied. “You know the last three times you had me do that they told us to stay in our lane. The first one was polite. The last one was not. How about I send the flag report to you, and you send it up the chain?”

“Because I told you to do it. Clear?” Pfluger snapped.

“Clear.” Mario opened the flag report and spoke, “Over my protest, based on the feedback given on previous reports, my team lead, Charles Pfluger has instructed me to send up an addendum to the flag for the Zecu’i’id cargo ship, the *Eye of the Pale Flower in Moonlight Under a Cloudy Sky.* He thinks you should pay close attention to it. Have a nice day.”

Jen held back a chuckle because Pfluger was still standing nearby. She could see him seething and glaring at Mario.

“Mario, sign off. In my office now.” Pfluger’s voice was clipped with barely controlled anger. He pivoted and nearly stomped into his office.

“Signing off. Ya’ll have fun without me.” Mario connected his class two government link to his workstation, sending several files before logging out.

He followed Pfluger into the office but did not close the door. Pfluger sat down at his desk with a frown and triggered it to close. “Sit.”

Mario followed the order, deciding not to push the issue, but as he did, he slipped his datapad off his wrist and tapped it flat.

“Effective immediately, you are on a three-day suspension.” Marti sat back with a small smile.

“For what reason?”

“Gross insubordination.”

‘Okay. Hold that thought.” Mario placed his datapad on the desk and activated it. A small hologram of another man’s face floated above it. “First of all, you decided to have a discipline meeting without letting me get a union steward. That’s against the rules, and you know it.”

“But you are a steward,” Pfluger protested.

“I’ll let Dmitri handle that.”

“A steward cannot be the representative on his own disciplinary charge,” the hologram answered. “And if you don’t know that, you need to go back to basic management training. And there is no regulatory statute or rule defining gross insubordination within the Space Traffic Control, nor is there anything in the union contract.”

Pfluger glared at Mario and the hologram in turn. “Mario sent an addendum to a report as I instructed, but in a way to specifically make me look bad.”

“Really?” Dmitri asked. “I am looking at the report right now, with the accompanying video footage.”

“I didn’t give you access to that,” Pfluger complained. “How’d you get access to that?”

“I sent it to him. Part of the grievance process. We get access to all the raw data pertaining to the complaint. Don’t worry, Dmitri has a higher security clearance than you.”

Pfluger harrumphed in displeasure.

“While Mario could have said it a bit more politically correct, nothing he said in his addendum was inaccurate. And unfortunately for you, there are also no rules on internal or interagency communications that cover this. That means you cannot suspend him without us filing a grievance.”

“No, Dmitri, He’s already flagged my personnel file. That makes it official. I think I will let him suspend me and we file the grievance and take it to upper management, and if we get nowhere, we take it to the Federal Labor Relations Board.”

“What?” Pfluger sounded a bit panicked now. “Well, there’s no need-”

“I disagree, Chuck.” Mario knew his boss hated to be called Chuck, but at this point he did not care a bit. “For some reason, since you walked onto this deck, you’ve gone out of your way to make my job more difficult, even creating on a hostile work environment. And other people have noted it. You assign me duties outside the scope of my job description, yet you never do that with anyone else. You review my decisions at four times the rate of the next controller. You countermand my traffic control decisions an average of two times a shift. The most you have done for anyone else averages once in a three-point-five-week period. And when you do that to me, you never give me a valid reason why.

“I have added all that to the grievance, also. I do not know why you dislike me, but right now, the feeling is well beyond mutual. In the six-month period you have been here, you have had eleven grievances filed against you. And six have been successful. You are not a Marine captain anymore. And we are not dumb ass privates that you can mistreat. Honestly, if this is what you call leadership, it is no wonder you are no longer a Marine officer.”

“That’s uncalled for,” Pfluger seethed. Mario had hit a nerve.

“Maybe, but that doesn’t make it any less true. Now, if you will excuse me, I have three days to kill.” He picked up his datapad, “Dmitri, I will talk to you later.”

 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

 

Hours later, Mario wandered across a moderately busy atrium. Ascension had a dozen or more atriums. Unlike atriums on a planet, these had large overhead domes equipped with holoprojectors that showed images from different planets. Some even had live birds or their xeno-equivalents. These large spaces allowed the station’s residents to experience something like being on a planet when they chose. This one had a large pond with Terran waterfowl.

He checked his datapad and discovered that the sky shown right now was noon over Acadia’s largest national park. It was an unlikely coincidence, but one that didn’t bother him at all.

He found his favorite spot, a secluded clearing near the pond, where a small, artificial brook bubbled down a hill into it. The area was surrounded by large bushes and a few evergreens. It was not precisely that he was avoiding people, but when he had downtime, he often came here to relax and read.

He pulled his backpack off and quickly set up a portable hammock chair. He pulled a paperback book from the pack, along with a large, sealed mug of iced Calabrian coffee, heavy cream, light sugar and a hint of vanilla. Calabria was the only planet humans had found that produced superior coffee to Terra. Its soil made it the most productive agricultural planet in the Federation, and within the top ten in known space. More importantly, it required very little in the way of terraforming. It was damned near paradise.

The paperback was a bit of an affection. All literature was published electronically. Some planets still had paper printing presses. The paper was nothing like it was in centuries past. Instead of simple wood pulp pressed together and rolled out flat, this ‘paper’ was high tech, durable, and could last for centuries. Some often had imbedded smart ink that could be used for animated images.

He used his datapad to read often, but he just liked the feel of the book and turning pages with his hands. Today he was reading *War of the Worlds*, by H.G. Wells. This antique story, published in 1897, was one of the first science fiction stories to deal with conflicts with an extraterrestrial enemy. He liked to read this kind of older story because it shined a light on pre-space humanity’s fears and expectations of what extraterrestrial life and interactions would be. And how wrong it often was.

The artificial environment included a refreshing breeze, and the wind rippled across the pond. He sat back in the chair and cracked open the coffee with a satisfied sigh. This coffee was expensive, but worth it. It wasn’t like he couldn’t afford it.

Before he started reading, he tossed some floating feed out on the pond for the waterfowl. They were pretty tame already, but he’d developed a relationship with the larger swans. These large birds would even come lay down next to him, especially if he brought along some raw fish. Today was no different. The mated pair swam up and gracefully, with heads bobbing up and down with each step, waddled out of the water.

“Ola, ‘Ricardo. Ola’ Lucie,” he called out to them. “I got your fishies. Come and get them.”

Mario opened a sealed bag and grimaced. The fish had gone a bit ripe, but the swans didn’t care one bit. He tossed a few to his large feathered friends, who eagerly gulped them down. Lucie was quite a bit more friendly than Ricardo. He trusted Mario, but kept a bit of distance. She would come close and all her head to be scratched occasionally.

When she did, Mario waved his left hand over a small tag on her left leg. All of the animals on the station had a tag. It allowed the station to track their location as well as monitor their health. Lucie’s tag had a bit extra built into it.

Mario, like all government employees, had the primary link with the secondary secure government link. He also had a third, covert link. This link had a longer range than the others, out to almost a meter. It was similar in concept to the Omni-link. It was grown from the host’s own DNA and completely separate from the other links. Unlike the Omni-link, this covert link was much smaller, with more limited purpose and capacity. This made it damn near invisible to all but the most invasive medical scans.

His covert link accessed a data file hidden in Lucie’s tag. It was a simple way to pass information, an unsuspecting mobile dead drop. The tag was designed in such a way as only specific covert links could even see it, much less access it. In addition to Mario, only four people knew of the tag’s existence.

“That’s a good girl,” he said softly. “Here’s the rest of the fish for your troubles.”

He tossed the rest of the fish to the mated pair before accessing the downloaded data. It took just a few seconds to scan through it all before deleting the data entirely. Deleting the stored data was easy and unretrievable for the organic computer. It simply killed the cells where the data was stored. Once these cells died, their organic material was process through the body, just like any other waste. It was an elegant and simple process.

“Interesting. Now how can I use that information?” He mumbled. His three-day suspension was now something more than a small vacation. He had work to do.

But first he needed to spend the right amount of time next to the pond reading, to ensure anyone watching him would see something he did regularly with no discernible differences. Hiding in plain sight was often as easy as showing people what they expected to see.



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

 

Forty-three minutes later, his reverie was interrupted by a petite blonde woman with short curly hair and bright blue-grey eyes pushing through the shrubs. It almost irritated him, but he realized it was a public space. It would be wrong to get mad at someone for doing the same thing as him.

“Sorry to interrupt you,” she said.

The voice was familiar, but he couldn’t quite place where he’d heard it before.

“She was right,” the stranger announced.

“Who was right?” He asked. “And what was she right about.”

“Oh, sorry. Jenna was right. She said you’d be here and that I should come meet you.”

“Éadaoin?”

“Right in one. Jenna took over when you went off shift. We had a good, long conversation. She talked quite highly of you. She went on and on about how handsome and funny you were. And smart, and clever, and honorable… and so much more Honestly, I think she likes you a bit.”

“That’s funny. She said the same thing about you after you signed off.”

“Really? How could we have had that kind of connection over just a few minutes,” she replied. “I mean, I thought you sounded quite nice. But you can never tell until you meet someone in person.”

“Yeah. So, Jenna talked you into meeting me? I guess I shouldn’t get upset with a friend who is trying to meddle with the best of intentions.”

“Oh. Um… Does that mean you don’t want to meet me?” Éadaoin’s voice held a hint of sorrow and he felt bad for how he’d said it.

“Oh, no. Not at all. I am sorry if it came across that way. It’s just that I haven’t had many people try to set me up on blind dates.”

“And they don’t get any blinder than this,” she agreed. “But I am not really out looking for romance, and I am not the type to sleep around. I asked Jenna what fun things were to do aboard the station, and she said that you’d be the best person to ask. You know more about this place than most people, and you have a lot of contacts with people. My contract is up aboard the *Eye*, and I am looking for a new berth. With all the bad shit going on lately, I feel the need to come home.”

“I see. Not a problem then. I do know a lot of fun things to do. I can take you to some very nice restaurants, or the hole in the wall greasy spoons that have authentic ethnic foods from all over the galaxy. We recently had a Khuglan set up shop on the Blue Arm, habitat section. Or we could do some Acadian cuisine on the Red Arm. But we can figure all of that out later. I need to pack up here and drop this all back at my place.”

“Your place? Remember, I said I don’t sleep around.”

“I remember. You can wait outside if it satisfies your honor. The last thing I’d do is something immoral like that. I don’t know you yet, but I’d like to. As my sister would tell me, ‘Don’t fuck it up like guys do.’ I like to think I am a bit better than that.”

“Older sister?”

“One of four older sisters. I am the only boy out of nine. I was surrounded by girls. Plus, my mom and all my nine aunts, and don’t get me started on my abuelas. They’d whip with a thorn bush if they thought I did anything to harm a woman.”

“I like your family already. I was an only child for thirty years, but mom decided I needed a brother about nine years ago. I think she got bored. I don’t really see him much, and we don’t have much in common.”

After Mario packed his gear into his pack, they headed down the banks to the more popular areas. “That’ll change when you get older. If you put the effort in.”

As they spoke, Mario started to worry a bit. After the message he’d gotten, letting a stranger into his life could be problematic. He doubted she was lying about why she was here. Complications were something he avoided religiously, but turning away a pretty girl, no a beautiful woman, was not something a normal guy would do. He was just stuck with it, might as well enjoy it. Keeping his eyes open, of course.

Ideally I would like to replace both my grinders with one. I know there are iterations of this question that always come up from time to time so I appreciate any insight.

Currently:  
\- 1 to 3 espresso shots daily plus a flat white every other day  
\- filter coffee every other day (orea, aeropress or switch)  
\- I primarily drink specialty light roast (Dak, Fried Hats, Sey, Onyx, Manhattan, ONA ..typical fanboy stuff) and occasionally will dip into something a little bit darker like The Barn espresso roasts that are light medium or so  
\- I enjoy experimenting with flow control, compound chilling, turbos, and other ECJ favourites approved by my wife's bf  
\- currently using DF64 with SSP high uniformity and ODE gen 1 with SSP MP for filter brews

EG1  
\- this grinder will replace both grinders  
\- love the build quality and aesthetic  
\- a little slower than I would like but ok as it will do espresso and filter  
\- personal opinion but I am not crazy about the grinding sound (maybe its different in person?)  
\- a little concerned about the stalling at low rpm but seems to be mixed opinions about this  
\- will be going for the Core burr option  
\- don't mind the idea of using the shaker, but I prefer straight to portafilter  
\- digital rpm display  
\- costs more than 01

Lagom 01  
\- the speed is appealing, even at low rpm it grinds fast  
\- I like the aesthetic, but the EG1 edges it out slightly  
\- better grind to portafilter option  
\- 102 mizen blind burr would be the choice  
\- cheaper option  
\- rpm isn't as accurate based on the dial vs digital display of EG1  
\- I prefer the sound of this grinder personally

I would be particularly interested in hearing from those who use the Lagom for espresso and filter, open to other suggestions (DF83v was considered but I cannot unsee the train look), I would still consider the Monolith but currently out of the running because I wouldn't consider it for filter (at least that is what I gather from the videos I've watched)

I’m always the one taking him to football practices and games etc. Usually when we’ve to travel to a match we organise in a group chat who drives who. As I always drive people often asks if I can pick them up. My son’s bf is always with us and it’s either one of his parent or he comes along. 

Well last couple of weeks his older brother has been coming instead and during the game we’ve been talking. He’s a tall handsome man and of course this was the first thing I thought but being a 52 year old woman I didn’t think much of it as he’s younger. We talked casually during the first time we met and we clicked well. I preferred to talk to him rather than the other parents my age. After that day he started showing up for practices and other matches and we got to know eachother better. After  few meets at football practices he asked for my number so we could «schedule pickups easier» and I gave it to him. Couple days later I was shocked when he asked me out on messages for a coffee.

I agreed and we got to know eachother even more. Couple dates later it started to get a bit intimate and let’s just say he’s been visiting me sometimes when I’m home alone. I do love this man but he’s much younger and I’m afraid my son will find it weird and don’t want me around as much. Our relationship is great right now but I’m afraid this can ruin it.

In pictures - 
1. Jalapeño Dijon Pork Belly - the meat was cooked to perfection and the Apple and the charred Brussels Sprouts added amazing texture and flavour to the Pork that literally melted in your mouth. We ordered a second round.
2. ⁠The Warm Almond Olive Oil Cake was fairly average for my liking. The Tiramisu was brilliant. Not too sweet and the Coffee and Cocoa were in perfect proportions. Not sure what the third thing is called. They sent that to us - on the house. It was a Vanilla Ice Cream with Candied Nuts. Simple but delicious.
3. ⁠Half-and-half Pizza - Carnivore (Bacon & Salami) & Truffle Mushroom. I preferred the Carnivore half but that’s not to say the Truffle one was bad in any way. 
4. ⁠Torta Tenerina 2.0 - This was the best dessert we had had here. You’ll love it if you like dark chocolate.
5. ⁠ Cacio e Pepe - Best I’ve had so far in Mumbai. I prefer a lot more pepper, but this was a sensible amount of pepper and cheese. 
6. ⁠Duck Ravioli. 
7. ⁠Crudo of Sea Bass - This got wiped clean in about 10 seconds. 
8. ⁠Meatballs al Forno - definitely order this. The meatballs were perfectly seasoned and not dry at all. 
9. ⁠House-aged Tenderloin Steak - wasn’t really a steak. The quality of the meat was good but overall the dish was strictly average. There are much better “steaks” out there in Mumbai. Can be skipped according to me.

The box and bottle is quite good, it also has a magnetic cap with an Ok atomiser.

Now coming to the scent , it opens with a harsh alcohol blast for few minutes which disappears quickly. Then you get some artificial coco/coffee notes which also fades away and then it becomes a sweet  biscuit vanilla kind of scent for few hours before it disappears entirely. I also kind of get some lipstick notes at the end. 
If you are a fan of Gourmand fragrances like me, you can try a sample of this one. 

I have never used the OG so can’t compare with it directly. 

The longevity is Ok, I got 5-6 hours with 6 sprays on my clothes as I don’t use ME on skin however the projection is terrible. 

I have kept the bottle for now to let it macerate in a hope that this may improve the scent or its performance.

Bottle / Presentation: 8/10

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Mets vs. Orioles: A Tale of Two Pitchers (and Why the Orioles Should Bring a Sieve)**

The New York Mets (-130) are favored to continue their winning ways against the Baltimore Orioles, thanks to a pitching matchup that’s as lopsided as a hot dog at a salad bar. Clay Holmes (2.99 ERA) takes the mound for New York, while Brandon Young (7.02 ERA) toes the rubber for Baltimore—a duo so mismatched, it’s like sending a navy seal and a toddler to a sword fight.

**The Numbers That Make You Snort Coffee**

* **Mets Moneyline Implied Probability**: 56.5% (per -130 odds).
* **Orioles Moneyline Implied Probability**: 30.3% (per +230 odds).
* **Total**: 9.5 runs (Over at -114, Under at -114). With Young’s ERA high enough to flood a bathtub, and Baltimore’s warm weather helping balls fly like they’re on rocket fuel, the Over 9.5 is a 53.2% implied play.

Earlier this May, I had a very promising meeting with a professor who would be going on sabbatical the next year. Our talk was long and lovely, he gave a lot of helpful advice on doing research and said he hoped to work with me in the future. I was really happy, because he was working on some very cool research in computational biology and I was hoping to join. 

Anyways jump cut to finals, one of my friends rushes up to me 7 minutes before her final and asks me to grab her a coffee from the campus café. I am not someone who makes good decisions under time pressure, and so I accepted without asking how I would get it to her in the exam room when it would definitely be past the start time. I grab the coffee, go to the room and see the exam is underway. She is in the second row from the door, so I powerwalk in, slam the coffee on her desk, and turn to leave. Lo and behold the proctor was unseen behind me, and it is the prof I talked with. I just smiled politely and left, screaming internally the whole time. He let me.

I have not had any contact with this professor since, because I do not know what to do. I feel like an emailed apology would be insincere, but a physical one is impossible until he returns from sabbatical and by then it would be too late. I was thinking of requesting a Teams call and apologizing (because I am fully willing to accept any academic consequences that would result from my actions, I know I f\*cked up) but I just feel really out of my depth here.

**“How did you even start keto?”**  
They expect some complicated meal prep or expensive supplements.

But honestly?  
It was just **one clean, no-cheat keto day** — that changed *everything.*

# 🕐 Why 24 Hours Matter More Than You Think

I was overwhelmed.  
100+ recipes, macros, electrolytes, keto flu, net carbs… it was too much.

So I said:  
**“Forget all that. Let’s just win ONE day.”**

Not a diet.  
Not a new identity.  
Just one experiment to feel better — and it worked.

# 🍳 Here’s the Exact 24-Hour Keto Plan That Kickstarted My Journey:

# 🔅 Morning (7–9am)

**Keto Bulletproof Coffee**

* Black coffee
* 1 tsp unsalted butter or ghee
* 1 tsp MCT oil or coconut oil → Blend and sip slow. No sugar. No milk.

**If you're hungry:**

* 2 boiled or scrambled eggs cooked in butter
* Handful of sautéed spinach or ½ avocado

# 🌞 Midday (12–2pm)

**High-Fat, Low-Carb Lunch Bowl**

* Grilled chicken or paneer
* Steamed or roasted veggies (cauliflower, zucchini, spinach)
* Drizzle of olive oil or a spoon of mayo
* Sprinkle salt, pepper, lemon juice, chili flakes

**Pro tip:** Add a boiled egg or cheese cubes for extra satiety.

# 🌙 Evening (6–8pm)

**Cauliflower Rice Stir-Fry**

* 1 cup cauliflower rice
* ½ cup chopped bell pepper or cabbage
* 1 tsp butter/ghee + spices (turmeric, cumin, garlic, salt)
* Optional: 1 egg or tofu for protein

**Bonus:** Herbal tea with pink salt if you’re feeling tired or headachy

# ✅ Rules for the 24-Hour Keto Reset:

* No sugar
* No bread, rice, or wheat
* No fruit (except maybe berries)
* No alcohol or soda
* Hydrate like crazy — add a pinch of pink salt to water
* Don’t overeat — just eat until satisfied

# 🧠 What Happened After Just 1 Day?

* No sugar cravings by bedtime
* Woke up feeling lighter
* Digestion improved
* Energy more stable
* I realized: *I CAN do this.*

Never told her. Thinking it was uncool since I was a lot older than most for all that. I played the casual guy she wanted me to be. And after a couple months we split ways that summer. I thought she was special but the setting was one set for no attachments. So I played the part and let it go. Years later we caught up. She in a relationship and myself single after another heartbreak. We talked and hanged and something about it felt home. But I respected her relationship even when she may not wanted me to. A lingering smile and conversations over coffee on campus while studying was enough. I fell for her really the second time we met rather than the first. But I dismissed it all and played the part of friend. A lingering thought that it would work out at the end was there even though I didn’t want it to be. Overtime I dated someone new. She actually introduced us. And we were happy to be friends with some past but everyone knew just a past. 

Years later I moved away. Moved away from everyone I knew and started over. But on Friday evenings surrounded with new friends I would wonder if she would like them. Thoughts of hometown and her were there in social events and nights out on rooftops later into the evening. 

A while back it was her turn to leave. The hometown we both said we would leave ever since forever. Both dreams accomplished. Both untethered to nostalgia. Both forever set on different paths. 

I never could admit to her. To myself. To my subconscious what she meant to me. Visiting home and not catching up for the first time was different. So many friends left our hometown (that was a common dream where we grew up). But never did nostalgia hit harder until she left. 

Now I’m back to my apartment. Overlooking the city. I got the apartment overlooking the city. Everything I wanted. Everything I told her I would one day do. But for some reasons it feels without depth. 

We talked before she left. I wished her well and said “finally you got out”. I’m happy for her. 

I wish I had said something. But I don’t know what could have been said. 

Frustrated that I never had the spine. Venting since none of my new friends know her. And none of my old can know what I felt about her. 

Now I have to move on. There’s no moving back to my home. My friends left she left and I left and the old days we were all together are gone. 

I can’t go back to that summer. The summer after my freshman year. The summer I looked forwards to concerts and getting into my real college classes (no more filler classes). The summer where I drove that old Camry and it felt like the fasted thing alive. The summer of my early 20s. The summer I met her. And the summer I let her go. 

Venting isn’t going to bring back the time but man. Does it suck I didn’t make different choices. Or maybe in a couple years I’ll be happy I did make the ones I have made. ",1,1752031896.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

The moon stared back—bright, full, and impossibly close. Stars flickered behind it like forgotten memories. I exhaled slowly. I smiled without thinking. The air smelled sweet, the warmth of the flowers wrapping around me like a blanket.

A black silhouette floated toward me, backlit by the moon, turning it into a tear in reality. As it drew closer, tentacles unfurled from its head, drifting behind it like ink bleeding through water.

Its limbs were thin and wrong, arms sagging with torn flesh that swayed behind like tattered cloth. Its torso stretched too long, its legs stunted and jerking like broken marionettes. Bone—porcelain-white and gleaming—jutted through the gaps in its rib cage.

Its skin was leathery and grey, impossibly dry yet glistening in the light. Beneath it, bulging veins slithered along its form, twitching as though alive—like leeches trapped just under the surface.



It reached out for me. Behind it, the tentacles pulsed and writhed, stretching high above, swaying like weeds in deep water. I followed them upward. At first, I couldn’t tell what I was seeing. A shape, suspended in the dark—white, trembling— Then I realized. Daria.

The tentacles—God—were coming from her. They spilled out from between her legs, twisting, pulsing, impossibly alive. Her pregnant belly had been split wide, dried blood crusted at the edges. Her skin was stark white, veined and brittle. Her once-red hair had gone ghostly pale, clinging to her face in damp strands.

Her eyes drooped, her mouth hung half open—like she'd screamed herself hoarse and then simply stopped.

Her skin cracked like dry porcelain, flaking at the edges. She looked ancient. Drained. Dead.

But she was still looking at me.

My scream echoed in my ears as I sat bolt upright. The marigolds were gone—but the image of her white hair still clung to the inside of my skull. The silence pressed in. No moon. No marigolds. Just the hum of the box fan and Daria’s gentle breathing—soft, steady, normal. I was back.

Sweat clung to my skin, soaking the sheets beneath me. I shivered, despite the boiling room, our AC had broken. I turned to look at Daria. The memory of her—twisted, hollowed out, fused with that creature—flashed behind my eyes. But she lay beside me, untouched. Her hair fell across her face like a curtain. I could just make out her closed eyelids, her parted lips, the soft snore rising and falling every few seconds. One hand rested protectively over her belly; the other stretched beneath her pillow and dangled off the edge of the mattress. It would be numb when she woke. Daria looked like she was having the best sleep of her life.

I’ve been having these nightmares ever since Daria got pregnant. They’ve gradually been getting worse. Each time, the thing comes a little closer. But this was the first time she was present.

That changed everything.

Cold dread pooled in my gut. In the dream, I knew that it came from her. Somehow. I felt sick. Her face had been so pale, her eyes hollow, her hair thin and stringy like old threads. Her body cracked and frail. Drained.

*Just a dream*, I told myself. *Just a nightmare.* But it didn’t feel like one

I slipped out of bed as carefully as I could, trying not to wake Daria, and shuffled into the bathroom.

In the mirror, my brown eyes stared back—wide, sunken, bloodshot. My skin looked pale, almost sickly. I splashed cold water on my face. A little color came back, I looked just a bit better.

That’s when I saw it. A single grey hair, curled against the brown. I reached to smooth it into the rest—and came away with a small tuft.

I froze.

My heart thudded in my chest, just a beat faster than before. *Just stress.* *It has to be.*

3:12 a.m. The dim glow of the bathroom clock blinked above the mirror.

I wasn’t going to be able to get back to sleep.

I paused at the door and glanced back. Daria had rolled over, facing the wall now, hair spilling across her shoulder like it always did. We’d only been married a year, but it already felt impossible to remember life before her. Our anniversary was coming up. I still had no idea what to get her.

I stepped into the kitchen and flicked on the light.

Something moved—fast. A dark shape.

A tentacle slithered into the shadows of the living room.

My breath caught. I rushed forward, flipped on the living room light.

Nothing. 

I stood there for a long second, staring at the empty floor. *I’m just tired.*

I went back to the stove, turned on the burner, and tossed some bacon into the pan.

Daria’s dead eyes flashed across my mind—staring, white, empty.

My grip slipped, I fumbled with the carton, nearly dropping the eggs. As I tried to steady myself my hip knocked into the fridge door.. The door bounced off the counter with a loud *thud*.

I froze, heart in my throat, listening for any sign that Daria had woken up.

Silence.

I put the eggs back and closed the fridge softly this time.

I gripped the counter, breathing slow.

*I need to get a handle on this.*

I’ve got bills to pay. A real estate deal to close. Groceries to buy. Two car payments. Medication insurance won’t cover. And Daria—Daria’s pregnant. The baby’s coming soon.

I absolutely can’t afford to fall apart now.

Thank God my dad gave us this house. If we had rent or mortgage payments on top of everything else… I don’t know how we’d manage.

I stared at the sizzling bacon.

Daria won’t be up for another hour.

*Why the hell am I making breakfast?*

  


Daria shuffled into the kitchen at exactly 5:05, clutching her arm like it had betrayed her. Breakfast was ready—eggs steaming, bacon crackling faintly in the cooling pan. The room still held a trace of the peppery grease smell, mixing with the soft hum of the fridge.

She dragged her feet toward me, half-asleep, and leaned her forehead into my chest with a dramatic sigh.

“James, my arm’s asleep again,” she groaned. Her red hair was a tangle of wild strands, sticking out like she'd been electrocuted in her sleep. I always wondered how she managed to wrestle it straight by morning.

She tilted her chin up, green eyes locking onto mine like it took effort to keep them open. “What’d you make?”

“Bacon and eggs,” I said.

She rolled her eyes and let out a mock whine. “You *always* make that. Lucky for you it’s my favorite.”

I turned toward the living room, grabbing my keys from the hook.

“You’re not eating with me?” she asked, faking a wounded tone.

“Daria, I keep telling you—if you want to eat with me, you’ve gotta be up by 4:30.”

She slumped into the chair and laid her head on the table, cheek to the wood. “I got a baby in me. I need, like, sixteen hours of sleep now. It’s only fair. And it’s not my fault you work stupid early.”

I shrugged, rinsing out my coffee mug. “McDonald’s pays just enough to keep the lights on. And somebody doesn’t have a job.”

She stabbed her fork in my direction, mock-offended. “Don’t be throwing around the J-word in my kitchen. *You* told me to quit, remember?”

“At Subway,” I said, sighing with exaggerated suffering. “And I’m not making my pregnant wife work, Daria. If you *do* get a job, I might quit mine and start drinking beer for breakfast. Maybe gamble. Maybe start throwing the bottles.”

She giggled, eyes crinkling. “Don’t wanna risk it, do we, James.”

I walked over and kissed her on the forehead. “Hey. Dad’s talking about handing me the Agency. Mom’s been on his case to retire early.”

She arched an eyebrow. “So… does that mean you can finally stop flipping burgers?”

“Not a chance. I’m going to be a real estate broker *and* a fry cook. Dreams do come true.”





Outside, the summer morning air was cool against my skin. The sky was soft and pale—no stars left, just the early wash of blue and the faint outline of the moon, already fading.

I got into the car and backed out slowly, gravel crunching under the tires. As I shifted into drive, something made me pause.

I glanced up at the bedroom window.

A figure stood behind the curtain—still, silent, framed in the pale light. Watching.

I swallowed. Probably Daria.



My shift at McDonald’s dragged. A man threw a tantrum over his pancakes being “too fluffy.” I stared at him blankly and wondered if I was still dreaming.

At 9:30, I drove across town to my dad’s real estate firm, my second job.

I finally closed a deal—small house, barely held together, but the couple was desperate. Their little boy had wandered through the empty rooms like he was discovering treasure. Probably three years old, maybe four. I really hope my kid can grow up with the same wonder.

The house sold for $100,000. A 3% commission meant $3,000 in my pocket. Enough to breathe for a month.

After the paperwork, I sat back in my chair and stared at the ceiling, eyes gritty from lack of sleep. Then Dad walked in. 



His hair was starting to grey at the temples, but his grin was as smug as ever. “James,” he said, leaning against the doorframe, “how’s the babymaker?”

“It’s Daria.” I muttered. “She’s okay. We’re okay.”

He raised an eyebrow. “You’re cranky. That means she’s healthy.”

“We got the house sold.” I pushed the paperwork toward him. “You want your half of the commission?”

He shook his head. “Hell no. You need it more than I do. If I don’t retire soon, I’m never going to.”

I forced a smile. “That’s the plan. I need the agency. I need out of McDonald’s.”

“The housing market’s garbage, James.” He sighed. “If I’d known, I would’ve gone into rentals.”

“Sold a one-bed, one-bath shack today for six figures. We live in a world of miracles.” I stated.

He laughed, rubbing his chin. “That house I gave you—I paid the same back in… Um… I believe it was 1990, my first house. I lived in it with my 1st Wife before… well, you know.” His face fell for a second then he slapped the door frame, his face lighting up again “You know that house has a balcony? You and Daria should use it more. I want to see pictures.”

There was an awkward pause

He shuffled in place, turned to leave, stopped and then finally turned back. “Your mom told me that you’ve been having nightmares.”

I went still.

“If you ever need to talk,” he said, quieter now, “you know I’m here, right?”

I nodded. “It’s just stress…” 

He looked at me concerned 

“I even found a grey hair this morning.” I added trying to end the subject.

His face tightened. Then he nodded and left.

**—**

At 2:30 I left to go back and finish my day working at McDonalds.



My shift finally ended at 6 p.m.

Daria called as I pulled out of the parking lot.

Her voice was bright with excitement. *“Jamie! I got us a pizza.”*

I frowned, gripping the wheel. *“Yeah? What kind?”*

*“Supreme.”*

I paused. *“…Seriously?”*

*“Jamie?”*

I sighed. *“Daria, one day I really am gonna start throwing beer bottles at you.”*

She laughed, the sound soft and familiar in my ear. *“You love me.”*

*“Sure. But not more than I hate olives.”*

*“Suit yourself,”* she said. *“But you better guard that cheese pizza you’re about to buy. I might eat it while you’re asleep.”*

I could still hear her giggling as she hung up.

I pictured her sprawled out on the couch, a pizza box balanced on her belly, hair sticking up like wild red grass.

Warmth settled over me. I felt a stupid grin spread across my face.

Then the image of that thing flickered through my mind.

The smile vanished.



Fifteen minutes later, I walked through the door, pizza box in hand. Daria was exactly where I’d imagined her: slouched on the couch, belly pushing up against the stretched fabric of her nightgown, her wild red hair pointing in every direction like she’d been struck by lightning.

“Hey James, welcome home,” she said with a lazy wave.

The slight smell of bleach lingered in the air.

“Daria… did you clean?”

She sheepishly slid her pizza slice back into the box. “I—uhh… yeah?”

I sighed and opened my own box. “Daria… you know I don’t want you doing that stuff right now.”

Her eyes narrowed.

“It doesn’t get done, James. You work like  twelve hours a day,” she said, voice tight with concern.

I sat down next to her, leaning back into the couch cushions.

I glanced at Daria expecting more, but she was transfixed on the TV.

She was watching that one SpongeBob episode—*Rock-a-Bye Bivalve*, where they raise a baby clam.

We ate in silence, Daria, focused on Spongebob, and I, happy to be home.

“Daria,” I said softly.

“Yup?”

“You know the beer bottle thing… it’s a joke. I’d never actually do that.”

She paused, looked over, her left eyebrow raised.

“James, I may not have had the best grades, but I know when you’re joking.”

She slid the half-empty pizza box onto the table, scooted toward me awkwardly, and laid her head on my shoulder. Her hand found the top of mine.

“But seriously… thanks, Jamie.”

“For what?”

She shrugged, “Just in case.”





I lay there, eyes wired shut, heart tight in my chest like a fist refusing to unclench. The air felt wrong—thick, heavy—and cold dread trickled down my spine like melting ice.

I didn’t know why. But I felt it. **Something was going to happen.**

Daria had fallen asleep before I even switched off the light. Her breathing was slow, steady, and soft. For a moment, that rhythm eased something in me.

Then— **a sound.**

*Wet.* *Slithering.*

My eyes snapped open.

It was in the corner.

Still. Towering. Watching.

Moonlight filtered through the curtains, glinting off its leathery, grey skin. Tentacles unraveled from its head—rising like smoke, then slipping across the ceiling with a silent, serpentine grace.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t blink. Not out of fear— out of **instinct.** Like moving would make it real.

It wasn’t looking at me. Its head was tilted toward Daria.

I followed its gaze.

The tentacles crept toward her—slow, pulsing cords that writhed across the ceiling, veined like they carried some thick, black blood.

Adrenaline snapped through me.

I lunged from the bed, slapped the light switch.

A harsh flicker. Light flooded the room.

Daria stirred, eyes barely open. “James… wha—are you okay?”

I turned.

The tentacles **snapped** back into the dark, as if burned by the light. But the thing was still there—bones gleaming through shredded flesh, like broken porcelain crammed into meat. Its skin hung in ragged strips, trailing across the floor like unraveling bandages.

“I… I’m okay,” I croaked, throat raw and dry.

She squinted at me. “You sure?”

I nodded too fast and turned the light off.

But I didn’t lie down.

I sat on the edge of the bed. **Watching.**

It didn’t leave.

The slithering returned—low and wet, like something breathing through water. The thing didn’t move. Didn’t blink. But it watched me. Patient. Present. A hunter with all the time in the world.

Daria’s breathing evened out again—soft and rhythmic. Comforting. Human.

But the thing stayed. All night.

Headlights passed outside, sweeping over the room, but never reached the corner. The fan hummed faintly behind me. And the creature stood, silent, absolute.

I stayed frozen—muscles locked, nerves frayed.

**It didn’t need to move.**

Then, after what felt like a lifetime, my alarm shrieked.

4:30 a.m.

I didn’t flinch. Neither did it.

I stared ahead, breath caught in my throat. Then blinked.

The corner was empty.

Daria stirred behind me. “What is he doing…” she mumbled.

The alarm stopped. I felt her hand on my shoulder—gentle, grounding.

She pulled me down beside her, wrapping an arm across my chest.

I turned toward her.

Her eyes met mine. Sharp. Awake. Concerned.

“You didn’t move,” she said softly. “You were in that same spot when I fell asleep.” She glanced at the clock. “You’re never here at 4:30.”

I pulled her close and buried my face in her hair. It smelled like lavender and skin.

“I couldn’t sleep,” I whispered.

A lie.

She cupped my cheek, her thumb brushing beneath my eye.

Warmth bled into me. Before I could drift off, she tugged me gently to her chest. One hand rubbed slow circles into my back; the other combed through my hair.

“Okay,” she whispered again, more firmly now. “But James… don’t sit there like that again. And hit your alarm when it rings. Please.”

I got up before I could fall asleep in her arms.

In the kitchen, I cooked in silence. Left the house before she could even come downstairs.

As I pulled out of the driveway, the living room light flicked on. The curtains shifted.

Daria’s face appeared in the window.

I couldn’t make out her expression.

—

The day was torturous. The first half of my McDonald’s shift crawled by. Fifteen customers would order, I’d serve them, then check the clock—only five minutes had passed.

At 9:45, I stumbled out and into my car. Fighting sleep, I turned the key and shifted into reverse.

At the intersection, I thought the light was green. Blinked. It was red.

I was halfway through before I realized. Cars slammed their brakes. Even over the music blaring to keep me awake, I heard the screech of tires.

Thank God no one got hit.

Still, I could already feel the ticket draining my checking account.

At 10:00 I walked into the wrong building—a hair salon next to the agency.



Mary looked up from her desk when I finally made it into the agency door. “You okay?”

“Yeah, yeah…” I mumbled, heading straight for the coffee pot.

Luckily, she’d just made a fresh batch. McDonald’s coffee just wasn’t cutting it.

I poured a cup, didn’t wait for it to cool. I downed it in one go. It burned my mouth, throat, stomach.

But I was awake.

“James! I *just* made that! Are you okay?” Mary’s hand flew to her chin.

I coughed. “Yeah... just had a rough night.”

Her face softened. “Is it about Daria? Is everything okay?”

She touched my arm—gentle, maternal concern.

“Yeah... pregnancy stuff. I don’t know how you guys do it.” I took the easy excuse.

She nodded, distracted, then perked up. “Oh! Mr. Carter said to give you this.” She handed me a sheet of paper with a sticky note attached.

“Let’s see what Dad’s got for me today…”

The note read:

“James, I’m busy today. Can you go set up this house for sale? Just needs to be listed and stuff. I’ll make it worth your time—$500.”

So... not *my* listing.

I sighed and skimmed the sheet. Address, square footage, photos. All there.

I slumped into the chair, cursing my economic reality. I’d been hoping to nap in my office chair.

“I can do it for you if you want,” Mary said, reading over my shoulder.

I shrugged. “Nah. I got it.”

I grabbed a second coffee and headed back out.

—

The house was overgrown. The listing photo made it look like a magazine cover. Now, weeds climbed up the porch rail.

I sighed and started calling landscaping companies. First call: busy. Second call: voicemail. Third: booked until next week.

*Of course. It’s Friday.*

I texted my dad:

“Do they have a mower here?”

His reply was immediate:

“Yes. Shed key under front mat w/ door key. Thanks. Also a weed eater in there.”

The push mower was a beast—thank God. It cut through the high grass like butter.

The weed eater, on the other hand, was a disaster. I had to reset the string three times.

But eventually, I got it done. Swept the sidewalk, staked the “For Sale” sign into the dirt, took a few pictures, and listed the place back at the office.

I was late to my second McDonald’s shift. I was scared I Was going to get reprimanded. I walked in the door. The manager just laughed and told me to stay to make up the difference.

My manager’s cool about the weird hours, thank God.

I pulled into our driveway at 8:30.

The sun was already dipping, staining the sky with orange and pink streaks.

My body felt hollow. I almost fell asleep leaning against the front door. It was only the jingle of my keys that kept me upright.

I stepped inside.

The house was dark and quiet—but warm. Still welcoming.

I headed to the kitchen, set my stuff down.

Two empty pizza boxes sat on the table. I felt a pang of disappointment. I was looking forward to having some. Yesterday’s dinner. Both boxes cleaned out by her.

I guess it’s peanut butter sandwiches for me.  
  


I fixed the plate and walked into the bedroom—expecting to find her curled up in bed.

The bed was untouched, unmade. Quilt still balled from this morning.

I turned, ready to search—then saw her.

Through the window.

Out on the balcony.

I opened the door and stepped outside, plate in hand.

Daria was sitting in one of the chairs I’d bought this spring—two big ones and a little one.

She had her headphones on, nodding along to a rhythm only she could hear.

Her hair was straight now, the usual wildness tamed, at least for the moment.

She tapped her foot to the beat, drumming softly on a pillow in her lap like it was a snare. She was singing under her breath, just loud enough to move her lips—too soft for me to make out the words.

The setting sun caught her hair, setting it aglow. Her pale, freckled skin shimmered in the orange light, so radiant it almost looked painted.

She looked so alive. So beautiful. So **her**.

I glanced down at her phone on the table beside her.

She still hadn’t noticed me.

She was listening to *Kiss Me* by Sixpence None the Richer. I’d never heard it before.

She looked over and saw me. Her face lit up.

“Hey!” she shouted, waving furiously.

She pulled off her headphones, set them beside her phone, and hopped up. She wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me, then leaned over my shoulder in a tight hug.

I noticed a heating pad on the chair where she’d been sitting.

She let go and stepped back. “Welcome home, James.”

She glanced at her phone. “You’re later than usual.”

“Yeah, sorry. Had to work late.” I sank into one of the chairs.

She plopped down on my lap, studying me.

“James, you don’t look so good.”

She touched my cheek. “Oh my God, you’re so pale.”

“Didn’t sleep well last night.”

She frowned. “James… you didn’t sleep at all.”

She sighed. “Well, you better sleep tonight. I’ll wake you up at 4:30.”

“I don’t need to be at work till nine. But I won’t be back home till seven.”

She smiled and looked up at the darkening sky. “It’s going to be a full moon tonight.”

I chuckled. “Don’t know if I’ll make it that long.”

There was a long silence.

She leaned her head against my shoulder, eyes misty.

“I’m so excited,” she whispered. “We’re going to be mom and dad.”

She ran her hand through my hair.

“First day of preschool… first day of school… graduation… we’ll see him off to college.”

She smiled. “I love you.”

“Love you too, Daria,” I murmured, struggling to keep my eyes open.

She giggled. “James, let’s get you to bed.”

I shivered as she stood.

She pulled me to my feet. I could barely keep my balance—I was that tired.

She led me inside, sat me on the bed, and undressed me like a child.

I felt warm all over as she laid me down and pulled the covers over me.

“Nighty night, Jamie.”

I felt her crawl into bed behind me. Her arms wrapped around my chest.

**And I was out.** —

I felt icy.

I was in the field again.

The full moon loomed overhead—impossibly large, so close I could see its scars. A cold breeze slid down my spine like a whisper.

The marigolds were brighter than ever, glowing like lanterns. Petals blanketed the ground, hiding the grass beneath, which had turned from green to a brittle, corpse-grey.

I was terrified—but I didn’t move. I stared toward the spot where the thing always entered.

I blinked.

And there it was.

The tentacles unfurled first, curling like smoke through the air. Daria was part of them now—impaled and suspended, a marionette strung by meat.

This time, the tentacles didn’t just emerge from her. They ran *through* her—threaded under her skin like pulsating veins, bulging and twitching. A bundle of them spilled from her mouth in a wet, choking tangle, still moving.

Her belly was gone. Flattened. The skin around her torso drifted like fabric underwater—thin, weightless, empty.

Then the moon changed.

Its white glow deepened into blue. The surface shimmered—rippled, fluid. Landmasses began to rise: first Eurasia, then the Americas.

It wasn’t the moon.

It was Earth.

Whole. Radiant. Perfect.

I looked back to the marigolds. They were so bright now they burned. My eyes watered.

Then the Earth cracked—*like an egg*.

A jagged line split the globe in half. The continents fractured. The oceans boiled into steam.

Fire gushed from the core. Not lava—*light*. Blinding, holy, wrong.

Cities folded in on themselves, sucked into spirals. Skyscrapers bent like wet paper. Forests went up in columns of ash.

People screamed—**not just dying, but unraveling**. I saw flesh peeling from bone, souls turned inside out. I saw families hugging as they dissolved, praying to gods that didn’t come. I saw **Daria**, duplicated a thousand times—each version split, split, and split again, until she was just fragments of skin in the fire.

I saw **me**—dozens of versions. Crawling. Burning. Watching.

Then, at the shattered core of the world, *something* emerged.

It had no form I could understand—just light and motion and vast, unknowable hunger.

I tried to look at it.

I couldn’t.

It radiated light, but I saw nothing. My brain refused to shape it.

Then tentacles erupted outward—towering, endless. They wrapped around the edges of the universe, pulling everything in.

They reached for me.

A scream ripped from my chest—

**Mine.**

I woke up.

I was sitting straight up in bed. Daria snored softly beside me.

In a daze, I slid out from under the covers and stumbled into the bathroom. My eyes flicked up to the clock above the mirror.

**3:12 a.m.**

I sighed—but the breath caught in my throat.

It was behind me.

In the mirror, I saw it standing there. Its reflection loomed over my shoulder, silent and watching.

I spun around—nothing.

I turned back.

It was still in the mirror. Closer now. One of its tentacles reached toward me.

Before I could react, something thick and rotten flooded my mouth. I gagged on the slime, the taste of decay choking me. I couldn’t breathe. My throat sealed shut.

I looked in the mirror again.

It was gone.

But I still couldn’t breathe.

My knees hit the tile. I clawed at the countertop, vision swimming. The pressure behind my eyes was unbearable.

I looked up—just in time to see my own eyes being forced out of my head in the mirror.

Then everything went black.

—





I jerked awake.

Daria flinched beside me, pulling back quickly.

“James! Oh my God, don’t scare me like that.” She gave a nervous laugh, brushing the hair from her face.

The clock read 7:30.

Daria climbed on top of me with a grin. “Welcome back to the land of the living,” she giggled. “You wake up like someone being resuscitated.”

“Baby Archibald’s kicking,” she said, rubbing her belly with a smile.

“Really?” I placed my hand gently on her stomach. The kick came—sudden and sharp, like a muscle twitch just beneath warm skin. I half expected to see a tiny footprint stretch the fabric.

I paused. “We’re not naming our baby Archibald.”

She chuckled. “Well, then you better help me pick something, or I’m going with a long, boring name. He won’t get any ladies that way—and we don’t want that.”





In the shower, I let the hot water run over my shoulders and tried to stop thinking about the dream. But it clung to me like steam.

What does it even mean? Is this just sleep deprivation and nerves? Or is our baby going to... end the world?

I rubbed my eyes and glanced out through the fogged shower door. My reflection stared back in the mirror. My eyes looked normal. Clear.

But something was off.

I was thinner than usual. Hollow, maybe. Just stress, I told myself. Probably skipped too many meals this week. I turned away before I could think too hard about it.





Daria had made breakfast.

The smell of chocolate chip pancakes hit me first—her second favorite. Scrambled eggs were still sizzling on the burner, nearly forgotten.

She stood over the griddle in an apron that didn’t quite fit anymore, her full belly pulling the fabric taut. She was laser-focused on the pancakes, flipping them with mechanical precision.

She didn’t notice the eggs burning.

I walked over, turned off the burner, cut them up with a spatula, and slid them into a bowl.

“Thanks, James. I didn’t even realize,” she said softly.

I glanced up.

She was looking at me, her pancakes forgotten. 

“uh, your pancakes are done,” I muttered,

“Oh!” She spun around fumbling for the burner knob.





Breakfast was good. I prefer normal pancakes, but it was worth it just to see Daria happy. She closed her eyes on the first bite, smiling like it was the best thing she’d tasted in years.

Then—

Daria was replaced with the thing, it’s tentacles flew toward me.

I blinked. Back to normal.

Daria was pointing her fork at me, a bit of pancake dangling from the tines.

“So what are we going to tell him, James?”

I stared at her.

“Sorry—what?”

She sighed, exaggerated and playful. “The baby. What do we tell him when he asks why the grass is green?” She stabbed another bite, eyes narrowed in mock seriousness. “When he can talk, obviously.”

“Oh. Uh... chlorophyll,” I said. “It absorbs everything but green light.”

She raised an eyebrow.

I stumbled. “We’ll dumb it down. Make it cute. So he understands.”

She nodded, already moving on.

“What about the sky? Why’s it—”

Her phone chimed from the pocket of her apron. She pulled it out and glanced at the screen.

Her face lit up.

“They’re doing the growth scan on Monday,” she said brightly. Then, softer: “Will you be able to come this time?”

I hesitated, running through my mental schedule.

“What time?”

“One o’clock.”

“I’ll talk to Dad. I’m sure he’ll let me go if I bring him pictures.” I smirked. “But I have to be at McDonald’s by two.”

She nodded, tucking her phone away.





**My day at work was utterly mind-numbing.** No real estate shift today—just a long McDonald’s stretch from 9:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.

It was Saturday. I watched happy parents shuffle in with their kids. Some hid behind their parents as they ordered Happy Meals in hushed voices. Others shouted their orders with big smiles, always slightly mispronounced.

It felt like I was supposed to be reminded of something.

Most days, it's just tired people wanting something cheap and greasy. But today? Today it was all kids.

And the whole shift, I couldn’t stop thinking.

About the nightmares. The hallucinations. The pressure. Two jobs. Daria’s student loans. The baby arriving next month. Groceries. Insurance. The damn AC unit that probably won’t survive the summer.

I kept punching the wrong buttons on the register. Every time, I cursed under my breath. The manager noticed. He shook his head and walked off.

If I get fired… I don’t know what I’ll do. McDonald’s is the closest job I have. Losing it would mean more gas, more time, more strain.

Those thoughts played on repeat in my mind while I waited at Little Caesars. I ordered a half-supreme, half-cheese pizza and stood there watching the rain as the worker boxed it.

Then my phone rang.

I fumbled the pizza onto the dash and snatched the phone up.

Daria’s voice came through, quiet and broken. “I… James…”

My stomach tightened. “What’s wrong? Are you okay?”

There was a second of silence. Then a sharp pop of static. “James,” she said again, voice cracking, “I need you here. I had an accident…”

I froze.

“What happened?” I asked, panicked. My voice sounded hoarse, too loud.

“Don’t freak out… just please come. Come home.”

I drove faster than I should’ve. Rain poured hard, turning the road into a misty blur. My wipers were useless at full speed. I tapped the wheel nervously at red lights, blasted through yellow ones.

I felt the car straining as I pulled into the driveway. Tires squealed. I slammed the brakes.

I ran through the rain, fumbled the keys at the door, swore under my breath. My hands were shaking.

I burst inside, soaked through.

And there she was—leaning against the kitchen table. Eyes red and puffy. But she was okay. I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding.

I stepped into the kitchen. A small plastic bucket lay tipped over, water spreading across the tile and soaking into the hardwood.

I walked up to Daria, still dizzy with relief, and pulled her into a tight hug. I kissed the top of her head.

Then I stepped away, bent down, and picked up the bucket. That’s when I noticed the wet stain running down her nightgown.

“James…” she started, her voice trembling. “I was just washing the dishes, when… it happened.” She tried to swallow the words. “I didn’t mean to—I tried to clean it, but I knocked over the bucket.”

She covered her face with both hands. “I can’t even bend down to dry it up.”

I didn’t say anything. I just walked into the bathroom, grabbed some towels, and returned. I dropped them on the floor and slowly began soaking up the water, one towel at a time.

“Are you mad at me?” she asked quietly, tears hitting the tile.

“I didn’t mean to scare you, I just…” Her voice cracked. “I feel so useless. You do everything, and I just… I don’t even know why I’m here.” 

I put the bucket and mop back in the closet. The sound of the door clicking shut echoed a little too loud in the quiet house.

I walked over to Daria and put my arm around her. She leaned into me, avoiding eye contact.

“It’s alright, Daria. It happens,” I said softly.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered.

“Hey.” I cupped her cheek, gently turning her toward me. Her eyes were wet, glassy. I kissed her forehead. “You don’t have to be sorry. You’re growing a person. That’s more than enough.”

She gave a shaky breath, trying to smile but failing.

“Ok, let’s get you cleaned up,” I said. “Bath or shower?”

“Bath,” she murmured.

I ran the water, adjusting the temperature with practiced care. I added the lavender stuff she likes—bought on a whim during one of our grocery runs last month.

While the tub filled, I helped her peel off her soaked nightgown and eased her into the warm water. She sighed as she sank in.

I sat beside the tub on the floor, one arm resting on the edge.

“You know,” she said after a while, eyes half-closed, “I thought I’d be good at this. Motherhood. But I just feel like... a burden.”

I didn’t have a perfect answer. Just reached in and brushed my fingers over her arm beneath the water.

“You’re not,” I said. 

She sniffled

“Thanks for coming home James.”

“Just call when you need me.” 

She closed her eyes again.

The faucet dripped. The house was quiet. Just the hum of the AC.

I felt at peace. 

I hope all this stress doesn’t affect the baby.

The hum of the AC was steady. But for a second, I swore I heard something slithering in the ductwork. Just water, I told myself. Just the pipes.



**Sleep came hard that night.** Daria was already out, curled beneath the quilt. The AC had cut off hours ago. For once, the house was cold.

Outside, cars hissed along the wet asphalt, their headlights sweeping across the ceiling like ghosts. Nothing else moved. Just the soft hum of silence. Then— A faint slither. Maybe a pipe. Maybe the house settling. Probably.

My eyelids grew heavy. The room pulsed dim. Just as I slipped beneath the surface of sleep— The bathroom light snapped on. And something stood in the doorway.",1,1752031671.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

It defined Generation X as being slightly older than I was (I was born in 1980), so I totally grew up with the understanding that Generation X were the slightly older cool kids who were independent and living in loft apartments accessible by a freight elevator and chain smoking American Spirit cigarettes and either complaining about life, culture, and society, or being completely nihilistic. I knew that they were the subject of Rent and WIRED magazine and Dave Eggers novels and Kevin Smith movies.  I also knew that if Quick Stop Groceries were real, and I were to try to go in and hang out with Randall and Dante and pretend to be equally annoyed by customers, that I would just be this annoying middle school kid who shows up and they would have to get rid of.  I'd be coming in all short, wearing my flannel, ""Hi Randall, Hi Dante! Can you believe these customers?""  I looked up to Gen X, but I knew that no amount of showing up at poetry nights at the local coffee shop and forcing myself to learn to enjoy Cafe Americanos would ever make me Gen X.

So I accepted that, and look forward to find my own identity.

In the last 5 years or so, people have been claiming that I'm on the tail end of Gen X, and I'm like, ""nooooo.... Stop reinventing that shit, tryna gaslight me.""  Also, whenever I see those lists of characteristics comparing Gen X to Millennial, in terms of experience and values, I'm almost 100% in the millennial category.

The only thing that makes me remotely Gen X is that I watched Knight Rider instead of Power Rangers when I was a little kid.

I never saw a typewriter being used for real (only in movies).  I grew up with a computer in my home. Our driver's ed assumed everyone would use automatic transmission (kids who wanted to drive manual took their own initiative to learn that).  I didn't come home by the street lights: I wore a digital watch, came home for supper, and then didn't go back out after.  I had cable TV from basically the time I was a little kid.  I never called to find out the time and temperature (but I saw people do that in movies when they wanted to pretend to have a phone call) because we had tons of clocks in the house, and I could tell the temperature well enough.  I always wore seat belts.  The only time I used, or even saw, a rotary phone was when I discovered a rotary pay phone in the front entryway of a bank, and rode my bike out there too put some money in just to try out dialing it.

So, yeah, stop trying to call me Gen X.

1lv8lv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lv8lv4/aio_for_being_annoyed_with_my_bfs_family/,AIO for being annoyed with my bf's family?,"I (f20) have been dating my boyfriend (m21) for almost two years now. Recently, I was offered a job at his family’s company, something related to my major in school. I love the job and I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity. The only downside is that it’s a 1.5-hour drive from where I live.

Around the same time, my boyfriend’s dad lost his job (back in February) and started working at the same company. Because of everything going on, his family decided to sell their house and move into a modest 3-bedroom, 2-bath apartment just 3 minutes from work. They asked me if I wanted to move in too. This was a big downgrade for them, and the change has clearly caused a lot of stress.

Now here’s where things start to get complicated:

My boyfriend’s family is not charging me rent. My parents, who are very protective of me (I’m the baby of the family), found this odd, especially since my family is tight on money right now. On top of that, my parents didn’t want me on the lease, and I agreed with that. Due to a lot of miscommunication and tension, my mom and his mom ended up meeting to talk things over. From what I heard, it wasn’t very productive. But the final outcome was: I’m not on the lease, and I’m not paying rent. And me moving in is a temporary situation until school starts up again.

Fast forward to move-in.

The house hadn’t sold yet, so just my boyfriend and I moved into the apartment at first. That first weekend, we started bringing in the few things we had (since most of the family’s stuff was still at the house). We also did all the grocery shopping for the week, while the rest of the family relaxed at the apartment pool. When we got back, we were actually scolded for buying one pot and one pan, because “we already have those at home.” But no one brought any kitchen stuff over, nor planned to. Plus, we paid for everything ourselves and didn’t even get a “thank you.”

So far, here’s what I’ve personally brought into the apartment (for just the kitchen):

\- Cups, plates, bowls, silverware

\- Air fryer

\- Knives

\- Cookbooks

\- Two-burner stovetop (the oven was broken for the entire first week)

\- Keurig

\- Brita filter

\- Sponge/dish soap

All of this is on top of everything that we bought, which is a much longer list. The only thing they’ve provided is a microwave.

Then my boyfriend left for a 2-week school trip to Costa Rica.

The first week alone was fine; my childhood friend came to visit from out of state. I stayed at my parents’ house so she could be closer to her friends and use my car if needed. I still stopped at the apartment every morning before work to make coffee with my Keurig.

But on the morning of Monday (7/1), I noticed some weird stuff:

\- Lights were left on

\- My bed was made differently

\- My things were clearly moved around/knocked over

It was clear someone had been in my room and slept in my bed, without telling me. I understand it’s the only bed in the apartment right now, but it still felt very disrespectful. On top of that, they had eaten some of the food I had bought specifically for work lunches. I hadn’t asked for reimbursement because it was my food that only I planned on eating. I was also under the impression that they would not be at the apartment at all until the house was sold. So this was a surprise. I bought five bags of snacks to last the month. They opened three, ate most of them, and didn’t bother sealing them properly, so now they are stale.

Then came Sunday (7/6).

My mom and I drove my friend 6.5 hours each way, home and back. Afterward, she came into the apartment for 2 minutes to help me bring in my bags. This is also when I found out they had all partly moved in their beds and furniture. While they are not living there full time now, they do come and go as they please, and spend some nights here. This is totally fine, as it is their apartment at the end of the day. I would have appreciated knowing that they planned on moving in when they did. It just caught me off guard coming into an almost fully furnished apartment, after walking into an empty one for 3 weeks.

As soon as I walked back into the apartment after walking her out, my boyfriend’s mom pulled me aside, crying, saying my mom had been “so mean” to her during their talk and that she “can’t be in the apartment.” I get that it’s her space and she has the right to say who can and can’t be there. But the way she brought it up felt manipulative, like she was trying to pit me against my mom.

She kept saying this apartment is her safe space, and she doesn’t feel safe around my mom. And here’s the thing: my mom is stern, yes, but she’s not mean. She’s not the type to threaten or be intentionally rude. I love my mom to the end of the earth, and the way she came at me felt childish and very disrespectful. At the end of the day, I will always choose my mom because she is the only person who has always been there for me.

After that convo, I went to my room, but even that space isn’t private. It has the only TV in the apartment, and she’s told her 10-year-old son he can use it whenever he wants, and he proceeded to spend the next 2ish hours watching YouTube at the end of my bed. This does explain the messed-up bed and the moved stuff from earlier. So while she’s talking about needing her own safe space, she doesn’t respect mine\*,\* which is the only private place I have here.

Then there’s the food issue.

I’m very territorial about food. I prefer to buy my own groceries and eat my own food. I don’t touch anything I didn’t buy. So yesterday (7/7), when I came home to find someone had used an ingredient I needed for dinner, I was seriously upset. I’d planned all day to cook a family recipe, and one of the main ingredients, something that should’ve lasted me a month, was gone. I had even announced what I was making and what was in it, and nobody told me they used it. They just left me to figure it out.

It probably sounds like I’m picking everything apart, but I’m a very independent person. I like doing things on my own. And when my space and boundaries are repeatedly crossed, I shut down.

My boyfriend comes back in two days, so I’ll finally have someone to help me mediate. But for now, I feel a little stuck. I don’t want to get kicked out, and I don’t want to seem ungrateful, especially since they say I can eat whatever I want from the fridge and pantry… even though I’m the one who stocked 98% of it. Also, one more very important thing to note, the most they have bought for food here is a loaf of bread and a pack of string cheese. I have bought EVERYTHING else. If they were buying most of the food, and I was only buying a small portion, this would be a different situation, but I feel like I am feeding 3 other people on the salary of one.

I hope this situation makes sense. I guess I’m just trying to figure out, am I wrong to be annoyed?",2,1752031617.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

1lv8g8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1lv8g8d/marigolds_part_12/,Marigolds (Part 1/2),"The marigolds reached up around me, golden and glowing, as I stood beneath the night sky. The moon stared back—bright, full, and impossibly close. Stars flickered behind it like forgotten memories. I exhaled slowly. I smiled without thinking. The air smelled sweet, the warmth of the flowers wrapping around me like a blanket.

A black silhouette floated toward me, backlit by the moon, turning it into a tear in reality. As it drew closer, tentacles unfurled from its head, drifting behind it like ink bleeding through water.

Its limbs were thin and wrong, arms sagging with torn flesh that swayed behind like tattered cloth. Its torso stretched too long, its legs stunted and jerking like broken marionettes. Bone—porcelain-white and gleaming—jutted through the gaps in its rib cage.

Its skin was leathery and grey, impossibly dry yet glistening in the light. Beneath it, bulging veins slithered along its form, twitching as though alive—like leeches trapped just under the surface.

It reached out for me. Behind it, the tentacles pulsed and writhed, stretching high above, swaying like weeds in deep water. I followed them upward. At first, I couldn’t tell what I was seeing. A shape, suspended in the dark—white, trembling— Then I realized. Daria.

The tentacles—God—were coming from her. They spilled out from between her legs, twisting, pulsing, impossibly alive. Her pregnant belly had been split wide, dried blood crusted at the edges. Her skin was stark white, veined and brittle. Her once-red hair had gone ghostly pale, clinging to her face in damp strands.

Her eyes drooped, her mouth hung half open—like she'd screamed herself hoarse and then simply stopped.

Her skin cracked like dry porcelain, flaking at the edges. She looked ancient. Drained. Dead.

But she was still looking at me.

My scream echoed in my ears as I sat bolt upright. The marigolds were gone—but the image of her white hair still clung to the inside of my skull. The silence pressed in. No moon. No marigolds. Just the hum of the box fan and Daria’s gentle breathing—soft, steady, normal. I was back.

Sweat clung to my skin, soaking the sheets beneath me. I shivered, despite the boiling room, our AC had broken. I turned to look at Daria. The memory of her—twisted, hollowed out, fused with that creature—flashed behind my eyes. But she lay beside me, untouched. Her hair fell across her face like a curtain. I could just make out her closed eyelids, her parted lips, the soft snore rising and falling every few seconds. One hand rested protectively over her belly; the other stretched beneath her pillow and dangled off the edge of the mattress. It would be numb when she woke. Daria looked like she was having the best sleep of her life.

I’ve been having these nightmares ever since Daria got pregnant. They’ve gradually been getting worse. Each time, the thing comes a little closer. But this was the first time she was present.

That changed everything.

Cold dread pooled in my gut. In the dream, I knew that it came from her. Somehow. I felt sick. Her face had been so pale, her eyes hollow, her hair thin and stringy like old threads. Her body cracked and frail. Drained.

Just a dream, I told myself. Just a nightmare. But it didn’t feel like one

I slipped out of bed as carefully as I could, trying not to wake Daria, and shuffled into the bathroom.

In the mirror, my brown eyes stared back—wide, sunken, bloodshot. My skin looked pale, almost sickly. I splashed cold water on my face. A little color came back, I looked just a bit better.

That’s when I saw it. A single grey hair, curled against the brown. I reached to smooth it into the rest—and came away with a small tuft.

I froze.

My heart thudded in my chest, just a beat faster than before. Just stress. It has to be.

3:12 a.m. The dim glow of the bathroom clock blinked above the mirror.

I wasn’t going to be able to get back to sleep.

I paused at the door and glanced back. Daria had rolled over, facing the wall now, hair spilling across her shoulder like it always did. We’d only been married a year, but it already felt impossible to remember life before her. Our anniversary was coming up. I still had no idea what to get her.

I stepped into the kitchen and flicked on the light.

Something moved—fast. A dark shape.

A tentacle slithered into the shadows of the living room.

My breath caught. I rushed forward, flipped on the living room light.

Nothing. 

I stood there for a long second, staring at the empty floor. I’m just tired.

I went back to the stove, turned on the burner, and tossed some bacon into the pan.

Daria’s dead eyes flashed across my mind—staring, white, empty.

My grip slipped, I fumbled with the carton, nearly dropping the eggs. As I tried to steady myself my hip knocked into the fridge door.. The door bounced off the counter with a loud thud.

I froze, heart in my throat, listening for any sign that Daria had woken up.

Silence.

I put the eggs back and closed the fridge softly this time.

I gripped the counter, breathing slow.

I need to get a handle on this.

I’ve got bills to pay. A real estate deal to close. Groceries to buy. Two car payments. Medication insurance won’t cover. And Daria—Daria’s pregnant. The baby’s coming soon.

I absolutely can’t afford to fall apart now.

Thank God my dad gave us this house. If we had rent or mortgage payments on top of everything else… I don’t know how we’d manage.

I stared at the sizzling bacon.

Daria won’t be up for another hour.

Why the hell am I making breakfast?

Daria shuffled into the kitchen at exactly 5:05, clutching her arm like it had betrayed her. Breakfast was ready—eggs steaming, bacon crackling faintly in the cooling pan. The room still held a trace of the peppery grease smell, mixing with the soft hum of the fridge.

She dragged her feet toward me, half-asleep, and leaned her forehead into my chest with a dramatic sigh.

“James, my arm’s asleep again,” she groaned. Her red hair was a tangle of wild strands, sticking out like she'd been electrocuted in her sleep. I always wondered how she managed to wrestle it straight by morning.

She tilted her chin up, green eyes locking onto mine like it took effort to keep them open. “What’d you make?”

“Bacon and eggs,” I said.

She rolled her eyes and let out a mock whine. “You always make that. Lucky for you it’s my favorite.”

I turned toward the living room, grabbing my keys from the hook.

“You’re not eating with me?” she asked, faking a wounded tone.

“Daria, I keep telling you—if you want to eat with me, you’ve gotta be up by 4:30.”

She slumped into the chair and laid her head on the table, cheek to the wood. “I got a baby in me. I need, like, sixteen hours of sleep now. It’s only fair. And it’s not my fault you work stupid early.”

I shrugged, rinsing out my coffee mug. “McDonald’s pays just enough to keep the lights on. And somebody doesn’t have a job.”

She stabbed her fork in my direction, mock-offended. “Don’t be throwing around the J-word in my kitchen. You told me to quit, remember?”

“At Subway,” I said, sighing with exaggerated suffering. “And I’m not making my pregnant wife work, Daria. If you do get a job, I might quit mine and start drinking beer for breakfast. Maybe gamble. Maybe start throwing the bottles.”

She giggled, eyes crinkling. “Don’t wanna risk it, do we, James.”

I walked over and kissed her on the forehead. “Hey. Dad’s talking about handing me the Agency. Mom’s been on his case to retire early.”

She arched an eyebrow. “So… does that mean you can finally stop flipping burgers?”

“Not a chance. I’m going to be a real estate broker and a fry cook. Dreams do come true.”

Outside, the summer morning air was cool against my skin. The sky was soft and pale—no stars left, just the early wash of blue and the faint outline of the moon, already fading.

I got into the car and backed out slowly, gravel crunching under the tires. As I shifted into drive, something made me pause.

I glanced up at the bedroom window.

A figure stood behind the curtain—still, silent, framed in the pale light. Watching.

I swallowed. Probably Daria.

My shift at McDonald’s dragged. A man threw a tantrum over his pancakes being “too fluffy.” I stared at him blankly and wondered if I was still dreaming.

At 9:30, I drove across town to my dad’s real estate firm, my second job.

I finally closed a deal—small house, barely held together, but the couple was desperate. Their little boy had wandered through the empty rooms like he was discovering treasure. Probably three years old, maybe four. I really hope my kid can grow up with the same wonder.

The house sold for $100,000. A 3% commission meant $3,000 in my pocket. Enough to breathe for a month.

After the paperwork, I sat back in my chair and stared at the ceiling, eyes gritty from lack of sleep. Then Dad walked in. 

His hair was starting to grey at the temples, but his grin was as smug as ever. “James,” he said, leaning against the doorframe, “how’s the babymaker?”

“It’s Daria.” I muttered. “She’s okay. We’re okay.”

He raised an eyebrow. “You’re cranky. That means she’s healthy.”

“We got the house sold.” I pushed the paperwork toward him. “You want your half of the commission?”

He shook his head. “Hell no. You need it more than I do. If I don’t retire soon, I’m never going to.”

I forced a smile. “That’s the plan. I need the agency. I need out of McDonald’s.”

“The housing market’s garbage, James.” He sighed. “If I’d known, I would’ve gone into rentals.”

“Sold a one-bed, one-bath shack today for six figures. We live in a world of miracles.” I stated.

He laughed, rubbing his chin. “That house I gave you—I paid the same back in… Um… I believe it was 1990, my first house. I lived in it with my 1st Wife before… well, you know.” His face fell for a second then he slapped the door frame, his face lighting up again “You know that house has a balcony? You and Daria should use it more. I want to see pictures.”

There was an awkward pause

He shuffled in place, turned to leave, stopped and then finally turned back. “Your mom told me that you’ve been having nightmares.”

I went still.

“If you ever need to talk,” he said, quieter now, “you know I’m here, right?”

I nodded. “It’s just stress…” 

He looked at me concerned 

“I even found a grey hair this morning.” I added trying to end the subject.

His face tightened. Then he nodded and left.

—

At 2:30 I left to go back and finish my day working at McDonalds.

My shift finally ended at 6 p.m.

Daria called as I pulled out of the parking lot.

Her voice was bright with excitement. “Jamie! I got us a pizza.”

I frowned, gripping the wheel. “Yeah? What kind?”

“Supreme.”

I paused. “…Seriously?”

“Jamie?”

I sighed. “Daria, one day I really am gonna start throwing beer bottles at you.”

She laughed, the sound soft and familiar in my ear. “You love me.”

“Sure. But not more than I hate olives.”

“Suit yourself,” she said. “But you better guard that cheese pizza you’re about to buy. I might eat it while you’re asleep.”

I could still hear her giggling as she hung up.

I pictured her sprawled out on the couch, a pizza box balanced on her belly, hair sticking up like wild red grass.

Warmth settled over me. I felt a stupid grin spread across my face.

Then the image of that thing flickered through my mind.

The smile vanished.

Fifteen minutes later, I walked through the door, pizza box in hand. Daria was exactly where I’d imagined her: slouched on the couch, belly pushing up against the stretched fabric of her nightgown, her wild red hair pointing in every direction like she’d been struck by lightning.

“Hey James, welcome home,” she said with a lazy wave.

The slight smell of bleach lingered in the air.

“Daria… did you clean?”

She sheepishly slid her pizza slice back into the box. “I—uhh… yeah?”

I sighed and opened my own box. “Daria… you know I don’t want you doing that stuff right now.”

Her eyes narrowed.

“It doesn’t get done, James. You work like  twelve hours a day,” she said, voice tight with concern.

I sat down next to her, leaning back into the couch cushions.

I glanced at Daria expecting more, but she was transfixed on the TV.

She was watching that one SpongeBob episode—Rock-a-Bye Bivalve, where they raise a baby clam.

We ate in silence, Daria, focused on Spongebob, and I, happy to be home.

“Daria,” I said softly.

“Yup?”

“You know the beer bottle thing… it’s a joke. I’d never actually do that.”

She paused, looked over, her left eyebrow raised.

“James, I may not have had the best grades, but I know when you’re joking.”

She slid the half-empty pizza box onto the table, scooted toward me awkwardly, and laid her head on my shoulder. Her hand found the top of mine.

“But seriously… thanks, Jamie.”

“For what?”

She shrugged, “Just in case.”

I lay there, eyes wired shut, heart tight in my chest like a fist refusing to unclench. The air felt wrong—thick, heavy—and cold dread trickled down my spine like melting ice.

I didn’t know why. But I felt it. Something was going to happen.

Daria had fallen asleep before I even switched off the light. Her breathing was slow, steady, and soft. For a moment, that rhythm eased something in me.

Then— a sound.

Wet. Slithering.

My eyes snapped open.

It was in the corner.

Still. Towering. Watching.

Moonlight filtered through the curtains, glinting off its leathery, grey skin. Tentacles unraveled from its head—rising like smoke, then slipping across the ceiling with a silent, serpentine grace.

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t blink. Not out of fear— out of instinct. Like moving would make it real.

It wasn’t looking at me. Its head was tilted toward Daria.

I followed its gaze.

The tentacles crept toward her—slow, pulsing cords that writhed across the ceiling, veined like they carried some thick, black blood.

Adrenaline snapped through me.

I lunged from the bed, slapped the light switch.

A harsh flicker. Light flooded the room.

Daria stirred, eyes barely open. “James… wha—are you okay?”

I turned.

The tentacles snapped back into the dark, as if burned by the light. But the thing was still there—bones gleaming through shredded flesh, like broken porcelain crammed into meat. Its skin hung in ragged strips, trailing across the floor like unraveling bandages.

“I… I’m okay,” I croaked, throat raw and dry.

She squinted at me. “You sure?”

I nodded too fast and turned the light off.

But I didn’t lie down.

I sat on the edge of the bed. Watching.

It didn’t leave.

The slithering returned—low and wet, like something breathing through water. The thing didn’t move. Didn’t blink. But it watched me. Patient. Present. A hunter with all the time in the world.

Daria’s breathing evened out again—soft and rhythmic. Comforting. Human.

But the thing stayed. All night.

Headlights passed outside, sweeping over the room, but never reached the corner. The fan hummed faintly behind me. And the creature stood, silent, absolute.

I stayed frozen—muscles locked, nerves frayed.

It didn’t need to move.

Then, after what felt like a lifetime, my alarm shrieked.

4:30 a.m.

I didn’t flinch. Neither did it.

I stared ahead, breath caught in my throat. Then blinked.

The corner was empty.

Daria stirred behind me. “What is he doing…” she mumbled.

The alarm stopped. I felt her hand on my shoulder—gentle, grounding.

She pulled me down beside her, wrapping an arm across my chest.

I turned toward her.

Her eyes met mine. Sharp. Awake. Concerned.

“You didn’t move,” she said softly. “You were in that same spot when I fell asleep.” She glanced at the clock. “You’re never here at 4:30.”

I pulled her close and buried my face in her hair. It smelled like lavender and skin.

“I couldn’t sleep,” I whispered.

A lie.

She cupped my cheek, her thumb brushing beneath my eye.

Warmth bled into me. Before I could drift off, she tugged me gently to her chest. One hand rubbed slow circles into my back; the other combed through my hair.

“Okay,” she whispered again, more firmly now. “But James… don’t sit there like that again. And hit your alarm when it rings. Please.”

I got up before I could fall asleep in her arms.

In the kitchen, I cooked in silence. Left the house before she could even come downstairs.

As I pulled out of the driveway, the living room light flicked on. The curtains shifted.

Daria’s face appeared in the window.

I couldn’t make out her expression.

—

The day was torturous. The first half of my McDonald’s shift crawled by. Fifteen customers would order, I’d serve them, then check the clock—only five minutes had passed.

At 9:45, I stumbled out and into my car. Fighting sleep, I turned the key and shifted into reverse.

At the intersection, I thought the light was green. Blinked. It was red.

I was halfway through before I realized. Cars slammed their brakes. Even over the music blaring to keep me awake, I heard the screech of tires.

Thank God no one got hit.

Still, I could already feel the ticket draining my checking account.

At 10:00 I walked into the wrong building—a hair salon next to the agency.

Mary looked up from her desk when I finally made it into the agency door. “You okay?”

“Yeah, yeah…” I mumbled, heading straight for the coffee pot.

Luckily, she’d just made a fresh batch. McDonald’s coffee just wasn’t cutting it.

I poured a cup, didn’t wait for it to cool. I downed it in one go. It burned my mouth, throat, stomach.

But I was awake.

“James! I just made that! Are you okay?” Mary’s hand flew to her chin.

I coughed. “Yeah... just had a rough night.”

Her face softened. “Is it about Daria? Is everything okay?”

She touched my arm—gentle, maternal concern.

“Yeah... pregnancy stuff. I don’t know how you guys do it.” I took the easy excuse.

She nodded, distracted, then perked up. “Oh! Mr. Carter said to give you this.” She handed me a sheet of paper with a sticky note attached.

“Let’s see what Dad’s got for me today…”

The note read:

“James, I’m busy today. Can you go set up this house for sale? Just needs to be listed and stuff. I’ll make it worth your time—$500.”

So... not my listing.

I sighed and skimmed the sheet. Address, square footage, photos. All there.

I slumped into the chair, cursing my economic reality. I’d been hoping to nap in my office chair.

“I can do it for you if you want,” Mary said, reading over my shoulder.

I shrugged. “Nah. I got it.”

I grabbed a second coffee and headed back out.

—

The house was overgrown. The listing photo made it look like a magazine cover. Now, weeds climbed up the porch rail.

I sighed and started calling landscaping companies. First call: busy. Second call: voicemail. Third: booked until next week.

Of course. It’s Friday.

I texted my dad:

“Do they have a mower here?”

His reply was immediate:

“Yes. Shed key under front mat w/ door key. Thanks. Also a weed eater in there.”

The push mower was a beast—thank God. It cut through the high grass like butter.

The weed eater, on the other hand, was a disaster. I had to reset the string three times.

But eventually, I got it done. Swept the sidewalk, staked the “For Sale” sign into the dirt, took a few pictures, and listed the place back at the office.

I was late to my second McDonald’s shift. I was scared I Was going to get reprimanded. I walked in the door. The manager just laughed and told me to stay to make up the difference.

My manager’s cool about the weird hours, thank God.

I pulled into our driveway at 8:30.

The sun was already dipping, staining the sky with orange and pink streaks.

My body felt hollow. I almost fell asleep leaning against the front door. It was only the jingle of my keys that kept me upright.

I stepped inside.

The house was dark and quiet—but warm. Still welcoming.

I headed to the kitchen, set my stuff down.

Two empty pizza boxes sat on the table. I felt a pang of disappointment. I was looking forward to having some. Yesterday’s dinner. Both boxes cleaned out by her.

I guess it’s peanut butter sandwiches for me.

I fixed the plate and walked into the bedroom—expecting to find her curled up in bed.

The bed was untouched, unmade. Quilt still balled from this morning.

I turned, ready to search—then saw her.

Through the window.

Out on the balcony.

I opened the door and stepped outside, plate in hand.

Daria was sitting in one of the chairs I’d bought this spring—two big ones and a little one.

She had her headphones on, nodding along to a rhythm only she could hear.

Her hair was straight now, the usual wildness tamed, at least for the moment.

She tapped her foot to the beat, drumming softly on a pillow in her lap like it was a snare. She was singing under her breath, just loud enough to move her lips—too soft for me to make out the words.

The setting sun caught her hair, setting it aglow. Her pale, freckled skin shimmered in the orange light, so radiant it almost looked painted.

She looked so alive. So beautiful. So her.

I glanced down at her phone on the table beside her.

She still hadn’t noticed me.

She was listening to Kiss Me by Sixpence None the Richer. I’d never heard it before.

She looked over and saw me. Her face lit up.

“Hey!” she shouted, waving furiously.

She pulled off her headphones, set them beside her phone, and hopped up. She wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me, then leaned over my shoulder in a tight hug.

I noticed a heating pad on the chair where she’d been sitting.

She let go and stepped back. “Welcome home, James.”

She glanced at her phone. “You’re later than usual.”

“Yeah, sorry. Had to work late.” I sank into one of the chairs.

She plopped down on my lap, studying me.

“James, you don’t look so good.”

She touched my cheek. “Oh my God, you’re so pale.”

“Didn’t sleep well last night.”

She frowned. “James… you didn’t sleep at all.”

She sighed. “Well, you better sleep tonight. I’ll wake you up at 4:30.”

“I don’t need to be at work till nine. But I won’t be back home till seven.”

She smiled and looked up at the darkening sky. “It’s going to be a full moon tonight.”

I chuckled. “Don’t know if I’ll make it that long.”

There was a long silence.

She leaned her head against my shoulder, eyes misty.

“I’m so excited,” she whispered. “We’re going to be mom and dad.”

She ran her hand through my hair.

“First day of preschool… first day of school… graduation… we’ll see him off to college.”

She smiled. “I love you.”

“Love you too, Daria,” I murmured, struggling to keep my eyes open.

She giggled. “James, let’s get you to bed.”

I shivered as she stood.

She pulled me to my feet. I could barely keep my balance—I was that tired.

She led me inside, sat me on the bed, and undressed me like a child.

I felt warm all over as she laid me down and pulled the covers over me.

“Nighty night, Jamie.”

I felt her crawl into bed behind me. Her arms wrapped around my chest.

And I was out. —

I felt icy.

I was in the field again.

The full moon loomed overhead—impossibly large, so close I could see its scars. A cold breeze slid down my spine like a whisper.

The marigolds were brighter than ever, glowing like lanterns. Petals blanketed the ground, hiding the grass beneath, which had turned from green to a brittle, corpse-grey.

I was terrified—but I didn’t move. I stared toward the spot where the thing always entered.

I blinked.

And there it was.

The tentacles unfurled first, curling like smoke through the air. Daria was part of them now—impaled and suspended, a marionette strung by meat.

This time, the tentacles didn’t just emerge from her. They ran through her—threaded under her skin like pulsating veins, bulging and twitching. A bundle of them spilled from her mouth in a wet, choking tangle, still moving.

Her belly was gone. Flattened. The skin around her torso drifted like fabric underwater—thin, weightless, empty.

Then the moon changed.

Its white glow deepened into blue. The surface shimmered—rippled, fluid. Landmasses began to rise: first Eurasia, then the Americas.

It wasn’t the moon.

It was Earth.

Whole. Radiant. Perfect.

I looked back to the marigolds. They were so bright now they burned. My eyes watered.

Then the Earth cracked—like an egg.

A jagged line split the globe in half. The continents fractured. The oceans boiled into steam.

Fire gushed from the core. Not lava—light. Blinding, holy, wrong.

Cities folded in on themselves, sucked into spirals. Skyscrapers bent like wet paper. Forests went up in columns of ash.

People screamed—not just dying, but unraveling. I saw flesh peeling from bone, souls turned inside out. I saw families hugging as they dissolved, praying to gods that didn’t come. I saw Daria, duplicated a thousand times—each version split, split, and split again, until she was just fragments of skin in the fire.

I saw me—dozens of versions. Crawling. Burning. Watching.

Then, at the shattered core of the world, something emerged.

It had no form I could understand—just light and motion and vast, unknowable hunger.

I tried to look at it.

I couldn’t.

It radiated light, but I saw nothing. My brain refused to shape it.

Then tentacles erupted outward—towering, endless. They wrapped around the edges of the universe, pulling everything in.

They reached for me.

A scream ripped from my chest—

Mine.

I woke up.

I was sitting straight up in bed. Daria snored softly beside me.

In a daze, I slid out from under the covers and stumbled into the bathroom. My eyes flicked up to the clock above the mirror.

3:12 a.m.

I sighed—but the breath caught in my throat.

It was behind me.

In the mirror, I saw it standing there. Its reflection loomed over my shoulder, silent and watching.

I spun around—nothing.

I turned back.

It was still in the mirror. Closer now. One of its tentacles reached toward me.

Before I could react, something thick and rotten flooded my mouth. I gagged on the slime, the taste of decay choking me. I couldn’t breathe. My throat sealed shut.

I looked in the mirror again.

It was gone.

But I still couldn’t breathe.

My knees hit the tile. I clawed at the countertop, vision swimming. The pressure behind my eyes was unbearable.

I looked up—just in time to see my own eyes being forced out of my head in the mirror.

Then everything went black.

—

I jerked awake.

Daria flinched beside me, pulling back quickly.

“James! Oh my God, don’t scare me like that.” She gave a nervous laugh, brushing the hair from her face.

The clock read 7:30.

Daria climbed on top of me with a grin. “Welcome back to the land of the living,” she giggled. “You wake up like someone being resuscitated.”

“Baby Archibald’s kicking,” she said, rubbing her belly with a smile.

“Really?” I placed my hand gently on her stomach. The kick came—sudden and sharp, like a muscle twitch just beneath warm skin. I half expected to see a tiny footprint stretch the fabric.

I paused. “We’re not naming our baby Archibald.”

She chuckled. “Well, then you better help me pick something, or I’m going with a long, boring name. He won’t get any ladies that way—and we don’t want that.”

In the shower, I let the hot water run over my shoulders and tried to stop thinking about the dream. But it clung to me like steam.

What does it even mean? Is this just sleep deprivation and nerves? Or is our baby going to... end the world?

I rubbed my eyes and glanced out through the fogged shower door. My reflection stared back in the mirror. My eyes looked normal. Clear.

But something was off.

I was thinner than usual. Hollow, maybe. Just stress, I told myself. Probably skipped too many meals this week. I turned away before I could think too hard about it.

Daria had made breakfast.

The smell of chocolate chip pancakes hit me first—her second favorite. Scrambled eggs were still sizzling on the burner, nearly forgotten.

She stood over the griddle in an apron that didn’t quite fit anymore, her full belly pulling the fabric taut. She was laser-focused on the pancakes, flipping them with mechanical precision.

She didn’t notice the eggs burning.

I walked over, turned off the burner, cut them up with a spatula, and slid them into a bowl.

“Thanks, James. I didn’t even realize,” she said softly.

I glanced up.

She was looking at me, her pancakes forgotten. 

“uh, your pancakes are done,” I muttered,

“Oh!” She spun around fumbling for the burner knob.

Breakfast was good. I prefer normal pancakes, but it was worth it just to see Daria happy. She closed her eyes on the first bite, smiling like it was the best thing she’d tasted in years.

Then—

Daria was replaced with the thing, it’s tentacles flew toward me.

I blinked. Back to normal.

Daria was pointing her fork at me, a bit of pancake dangling from the tines.

“So what are we going to tell him, James?”

I stared at her.

“Sorry—what?”

She sighed, exaggerated and playful. “The baby. What do we tell him when he asks why the grass is green?” She stabbed another bite, eyes narrowed in mock seriousness. “When he can talk, obviously.”

“Oh. Uh... chlorophyll,” I said. “It absorbs everything but green light.”

She raised an eyebrow.

I stumbled. “We’ll dumb it down. Make it cute. So he understands.”

She nodded, already moving on.

“What about the sky? Why’s it—”

Her phone chimed from the pocket of her apron. She pulled it out and glanced at the screen.

Her face lit up.

“They’re doing the growth scan on Monday,” she said brightly. Then, softer: “Will you be able to come this time?”

I hesitated, running through my mental schedule.

“What time?”

“One o’clock.”

“I’ll talk to Dad. I’m sure he’ll let me go if I bring him pictures.” I smirked. “But I have to be at McDonald’s by two.”

She nodded, tucking her phone away.

My day at work was utterly mind-numbing. No real estate shift today—just a long McDonald’s stretch from 9:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.

It was Saturday. I watched happy parents shuffle in with their kids. Some hid behind their parents as they ordered Happy Meals in hushed voices. Others shouted their orders with big smiles, always slightly mispronounced.

It felt like I was supposed to be reminded of something.

Most days, it's just tired people wanting something cheap and greasy. But today? Today it was all kids.

And the whole shift, I couldn’t stop thinking.

About the nightmares. The hallucinations. The pressure. Two jobs. Daria’s student loans. The baby arriving next month. Groceries. Insurance. The damn AC unit that probably won’t survive the summer.

I kept punching the wrong buttons on the register. Every time, I cursed under my breath. The manager noticed. He shook his head and walked off.

If I get fired… I don’t know what I’ll do. McDonald’s is the closest job I have. Losing it would mean more gas, more time, more strain.

Those thoughts played on repeat in my mind while I waited at Little Caesars. I ordered a half-supreme, half-cheese pizza and stood there watching the rain as the worker boxed it.

Then my phone rang.

I fumbled the pizza onto the dash and snatched the phone up.

Daria’s voice came through, quiet and broken. “I… James…”

My stomach tightened. “What’s wrong? Are you okay?”

There was a second of silence. Then a sharp pop of static. “James,” she said again, voice cracking, “I need you here. I had an accident…”

I froze.

“What happened?” I asked, panicked. My voice sounded hoarse, too loud.

“Don’t freak out… just please come. Come home.”

I drove faster than I should’ve. Rain poured hard, turning the road into a misty blur. My wipers were useless at full speed. I tapped the wheel nervously at red lights, blasted through yellow ones.

I felt the car straining as I pulled into the driveway. Tires squealed. I slammed the brakes.

I ran through the rain, fumbled the keys at the door, swore under my breath. My hands were shaking.

I burst inside, soaked through.

And there she was—leaning against the kitchen table. Eyes red and puffy. But she was okay. I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding.

I stepped into the kitchen. A small plastic bucket lay tipped over, water spreading across the tile and soaking into the hardwood.

I walked up to Daria, still dizzy with relief, and pulled her into a tight hug. I kissed the top of her head.

Then I stepped away, bent down, and picked up the bucket. That’s when I noticed the wet stain running down her nightgown.

“James…” she started, her voice trembling. “I was just washing the dishes, when… it happened.” She tried to swallow the words. “I didn’t mean to—I tried to clean it, but I knocked over the bucket.”

She covered her face with both hands. “I can’t even bend down to dry it up.”

I didn’t say anything. I just walked into the bathroom, grabbed some towels, and returned. I dropped them on the floor and slowly began soaking up the water, one towel at a time.

“Are you mad at me?” she asked quietly, tears hitting the tile.

“I didn’t mean to scare you, I just…” Her voice cracked. “I feel so useless. You do everything, and I just… I don’t even know why I’m here.” 

I put the bucket and mop back in the closet. The sound of the door clicking shut echoed a little too loud in the quiet house.

I walked over to Daria and put my arm around her. She leaned into me, avoiding eye contact.

“It’s alright, Daria. It happens,” I said softly.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered.

“Hey.” I cupped her cheek, gently turning her toward me. Her eyes were wet, glassy. I kissed her forehead. “You don’t have to be sorry. You’re growing a person. That’s more than enough.”

She gave a shaky breath, trying to smile but failing.

“Ok, let’s get you cleaned up,” I said. “Bath or shower?”

“Bath,” she murmured.

I ran the water, adjusting the temperature with practiced care. I added the lavender stuff she likes—bought on a whim during one of our grocery runs last month.

While the tub filled, I helped her peel off her soaked nightgown and eased her into the warm water. She sighed as she sank in.

I sat beside the tub on the floor, one arm resting on the edge.

“You know,” she said after a while, eyes half-closed, “I thought I’d be good at this. Motherhood. But I just feel like... a burden.”

I didn’t have a perfect answer. Just reached in and brushed my fingers over her arm beneath the water.

“You’re not,” I said. 

She sniffled

“Thanks for coming home James.”

“Just call when you need me.” 

She closed her eyes again.

The faucet dripped. The house was quiet. Just the hum of the AC.

I felt at peace. 

I hope all this stress doesn’t affect the baby.

The hum of the AC was steady. But for a second, I swore I heard something slithering in the ductwork. Just water, I told myself. Just the pipes.

Sleep came hard that night. Daria was already out, curled beneath the quilt. The AC had cut off hours ago. For once, the house was cold.

Outside, cars hissed along the wet asphalt, their headlights sweeping across the ceiling like ghosts. Nothing else moved. Just the soft hum of silence. Then— A faint slither. Maybe a pipe. Maybe the house settling. Probably.

My eyelids grew heavy. The room pulsed dim. Just as I slipped beneath the surface of sleep— The bathroom light snapped on. And something stood in the doorway.",1,1752031118.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

She lives just 3 doors away from me and i find her cute as hell. i thought maybe she liked me as well and always used to say hi immediately whenever she sees me and her hand shakes when she presses the button on the lift. I was also terrified of saying something awkward and weird that would set her off, so i just stayed silent and asked questions like aap job karte ho?office kaha hain(dumb questions ik but my mind stops working whenever i see her).Last week i gathered enough courage and waited for her near the elevator to come out.We went down silently without saying a thing and I got cold feet but the moment door opened and she went out, i went after her and called her name.She turned around and i went blank for a second and then asked""aapke paas time ho toh, aap coffee aur walk par chalna chahoge?""
she said""mujhe late ho jaata office se aane mai,10 baj jaate hain"".
i replied""aur jis din office nahi ho tab?""
""sure"" she said after a 2 second gap
and then left after saying""meri shuttle aa rahi hain,mujhe late ho raha hain""
i thought i finally got a date with her and feeling very excited but in my dumbness forgot to take her number. So just had to wait for few more days before i could see her again. That day came after navratri and one morning i went to the lift and saw her again. I asked about our conversation was left unfinished and if she will come.
""mera bohot busy schedule hain, aur jis din office nahi hota tab aur bhi zyada busy hoti hain, toh mai neeche nahi aa sakti"" and that's it!!!
I mean what went wrong in this case???
did i asked too many stupid questions and put her off or was it too early to ask?
is there any chance to convince her at this point? what could be the reason why she said yes initially and then declined afterwards? 
i am confused at this point and wanted opinion on this.
I changed my time in the morning for gym so I couldn't see her waiting for the elevator and just avoid the awkwardness and it's been a long time since i saw her again. But damn i just could not get her off my mind and she's so cute and pretty. I don't think there's any chance anything would happen between us in the future.
so yeah any leads would be welcome.

A few days in, I wasn’t just feeling more focused. I was also less jittery, less anxious, and somehow a bit more level throughout the day.

Salary starting next month: 83k (pre tax- estimating I will take home around $4800 a month)

Extra income: around $1500 take home after tax 

HYSA: $20,000 (3.65% APY)

Brokerage account: $100 invested in VOO (lol) 

Checking: $1400

No Roth IRA or 401k started yet. New job starting next month offers 11% 401k match so I plan to start contributing right away. I am also going to open a Roth IRA and contribute the max each month (around 580) 


BILLS:
- Student loans: 97,000 at 7% interest rate. My main goal is to pay this off in 5 years, which means $2k a month. I would only have to contribute $1700 to reach this number because my job offers a $300 monthly tax free contribution to loans. 
- car payment $455 
- no rent (I live at home) 
- no additional credit card debt 
- around $250-300 ish a month for subscriptions + nails + food/coffee + minimal   daily spending  

Doing the math,  after contributing to my 401k, Roth IRA, student loans, car payment and daily spending, I’ll have around 2200 extra a month left. Although additional expenses are bound to happen and this number may be significantly less some months, what would be the best thing to do with any extra money? Do I put it in my HYS? Brokerage account ? Contribute more to my loans?

I got a shed!! Which means… no more preserve jars in the living room! I’ve officially cleared out my house and moved all production to a fully loaded shed packed with kegs, oil makers, and preserve jars. But now my house feels… kinda empty? Like, eerily quiet. I went from sleeping among the sweet scent of melon jelly to just… walls. Send interior decorating tips. Please.

Meanwhile, on the farm:
	•	So many pigs… They’re cute, rich in truffles, a pain in the butt to pet, and absolutely reek. This is why they’re stationed far, far away from my freshly cleared-out home.
	•	Greenhouse is nearly maxed out. A few fruit trees, tons of ancient fruit, and some coffee to keep things buzzing.
	•	Double tree farms. One for lumber that I only chop when fully grown. The other’s my syrup/resin operation, tapped and thriving.
	•	Beehive chaos. I finally got a full setup going, but I forgot one minor detail… flowers. So now I have one poor flower out there working overtime to keep a whole swarm of bees happy. Pray for her.
	•	Berry overload. Blueberries, strawberries, and now cranberries. I seem to be drowning in berries, but with winter on the way, I want those kegs working overtime.

Looking for advice:
	•	Are preserve jars still worth it long-term?
	•	Should I finally invest in a coop, or nah?
	•	What do you think I’m behind on?

Still Joja (I can feel the spirits disapproving), but I’m definitely thinking about going the community route next time.

Appreciate the positive, negative, and hilarious feedback you all give! Happy farming!",1,1752030208.0,StardewValley,0,0.67,False

Anyone have other suggestions? And is my coffee table/ TV table okay? Or should I get something darker to match the floors? Like a walnut brown. Open to changing all furniture except the couch and desk.

So far, I’ve done three—Dora‘s Loft, Sunshine Town, and Slow Life Cafe. I enjoyed the ladder two, a book nook and a cozy coffee shop, but Dora’s Loft definitely takes the cake for my favourite. It was not the best first taste into the word of Rolife miniatures due to the complexity and time it takes to build, but I loved it. Maybe I wanted to scream at times and stomp all over those annoying little wire decorations that would fall apart before the glue dried, but ever since I finished it I’ve longed for something that challenging again. Something that takes at least a month, something that makes me want to rip my hair out. So my question is, what should my next Rolife creation be? My two strong contenders are Emily’s Flower Shop and Casey’s Greenhouse, leaning more towards Emily’s. The one slight concern is that according to my internet sleuthing, Emily’s Flower Shop comes in two separate variants—the original, substantially more challenging one, and the newer, updated, and way easier one. Is there a way to ensure I get the harder one? Is the updated one actually easier? With Casey’s Greenhouse, I’d appreciate knowing roughly how long it takes, how complicated it is, etc, etc. Either way, I’d love to know your experiences with building either Emily’s or Casey’s, or any other mega-hard rolife kits you’ve done that you’d recommend to someone who wants to get frustrated by it. At least 20h or a month ish total of building time. Or more! The longer and harder the better!",2,1752029967.0,Dollhouses,0,0.75,False

1lv7zj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1lv7zj4/husband_loves_to_play_dead_i_made_it_happen_he/,"Husband loves to play dead? I made it happen - He thought for a second, ""I'll give it another week, maybe.","Three months after my husband went missing in a skiing accident, I saw him at a bar.

He had his arm slung around ""sis-bro"" Jamie's shoulder, laughing like he was free from a life sentence. “Thanks to you, dude,” he was saying, ""I was starting to forget what real freedom felt like.""

His bros were buying him shots, one after another, asking when he was going to surface.

He thought for a second, ""I'll give it another week, maybe. Let her sweat it out a bit, you know, drive her crazy before I show my face again.""

I was standing in the shadows, watching him bask in his 'freedom', and dialed my friend at the county records office.

1.

“I’m going to have Mark Harrison declared legally deceased,” I said, my voice tight.

“You're not going to keep looking?” my friend asked, hesitating.

I looked up at Mark, who was now whispering something to Jamie, and my eyes stung. “There’s no point.”

You can’t find someone who doesn’t want to be found.

I hung up and went back to my booth.

My bestie, Sarah, saw my face and shoved a drink into my hand. “Look, honey, Mark’s been gone for three months. The odds of him being alive are basically zero. You need to let go, move on.”

I stared at the colorful drink in my glass and downed it in one go.

The burn of the liquor made my eyes water, and I blinked back the tears, asking, “Do you think anyone would fake their own death to get away from their wife?”

She looked at me like I’d sprouted a second head. ""What kind of crazy talk is that? Only a real dirtbag would pull a stunt like that. He’d be better off actually dead!”

I wiped away the tears and grabbed my purse.

“You’re right, I need to let him go.”

I left and went home.

The house was silent. It’d been this way for three months. I hated the silence. I’d started leaving all the lights on, brewing a cup of his favorite tea and putting it on the coffee table, pretending he was still there.

I just didn't understand. If he didn't want to be married to me anymore, he could have just filed for divorce. Why fake a skiing accident and disappear?

I sat on the couch and picked up the two cartoonish figurines of us he'd given me.

“When I’m not here,"" he’d said, grinning, ""these little guys can keep you company.""

His words clashed with the annoyed tone I’d heard at the bar.

“Chloe was sweet and chill before we got married, but now she’s way too clingy. This fake-out will teach her a lesson and she’ll lay off.”

Jamie had poured him another shot. “Well, at least I never cling to you! We've been buds for years.”

“You’re the best, man,” he'd replied.

They called themselves “bros” but their legs were intertwined.

The thought made my stomach churn.

I chucked the figurines in the trash and grabbed my phone, sending a mass text:

Mark Harrison passed away in an accident three months ago. Memorial service next week.

Mark’s buddies started hammering me with texts, full of outrage.

“How can you have a funeral if you haven’t found his body?”

“Chloe, have you lost it? Mark's not dead!”

“If Mark comes back and sees his own memorial service he’s gonna lose it! Chloe, think this through, do you want to make Mark angry?”

I didn't reply to the first texts, only to the last:

“He’s dead. He’s beyond being angry now.”

I tossed my phone aside and started packing up Mark’s stuff.

For the past three months, I had been searching for him in the mountain town where he was “skiing,” and barely been home.

The bedroom was mostly as we'd left it.

I opened his closet and froze.

His clothes were gone, like half of them, and all that was left were the items he’d never wear at this time of year.

Tears started to fall.

I had spent three months looking for him, and he’d been sneaking back here to grab his crap whenever I wasn't around.

2.

I pulled up the security footage and fast-forwarded through the last month.

At the start of the month, Mark had walked in with his arm around Jamie, leaving two hours later with a ton of clothes.

Mid-month, he’d carried Jamie into the house, and Jamie hadn't left till the morning.

A couple of nights ago, they'd come home under the cover of darkness, leaving early yesterday morning.

I had been looking for him in the next state over when these things had happened.

I watched the screen as tears streamed down my face, not for Mark, but for myself.

How had I fallen for such a scum bag?

I had been losing sleep, worrying about him, while he and his ""bro"" were sleeping in my house, maybe even my bed.

I clenched my fist and willed myself not to start hyperventilating.

The phone rang.

I didn’t want to answer but it kept ringing.

I took a deep breath, got up and looked at the caller ID.

It was Mark's uncle, Ben Harrison. I quickly answered. “Uncle Ben, is everything okay?”

“Mark’s not dead.”

He sent a video.

It was Mark and Jamie doing a sake bomb, their eyes glued to one another.

My breath hitched, and my fingers trembled as I spoke. “I know he’s not dead.”

The man sounded surprised, but then laughed. “Then why are you planning a funeral?”

“Everyone kept saying he was dead. I wanted to believe it. So, he gets a funeral.”

Ben was silent for a second. “So you’re saying you’re widowed?”

“Yeah,” I replied.

Ben Harrison was Mark's uncle by adoption, and I barely knew him.

He was the first person to tell me straight up that Mark was alive. I felt like I owed him something for that.

“If you’re free next week, you can come to the service.”

“I will.”

Then another video came through.

Mark’s friends are showing him something on their phone and he throws his drink. Jamie puts her hand on his chest like she’s trying to calm him down.

The bar was too loud for me to hear, but I could see Mark's face soften. He even buried his face in Jamie’s shoulder.

He must have seen my mass text, and he got pissed. And, somehow, just a few words from Jamie had soothed him.

Whenever he got mad at me, he’d make me spend the night thinking about what I did wrong. Only then he would forgive me.

I closed my eyes, saved the videos, and set the phone down.

Right then, Jamie called.

I answered, and the loud music in the background nearly deafened me.

Jamie was shouting. “Chloe! Are you planning a memorial service for Mark? Are you crazy? Cancel that thing now! If he ever sees it when he comes back, you’ll be sorry!”

Before she finished, I hung up, grabbed a blanket, and crashed on the couch.

It was the first good sleep I’d had in three months.

The next morning, I went down to the courthouse to get Mark declared officially deceased.

Once I got the paperwork, I went to Jamie’s place.

Her front door was closed, and it took me several tries on the doorbell before I heard footsteps.

She was wearing a silk robe, leaning against the doorframe, and there was evidence of a good time all over her neck and collarbone.

“Oh, it’s you. What do you want?”

I glanced at her neck, then her face, which held nothing but contempt.

“I wanted to invite you to Mark’s memorial service. Seeing as you were his ‘best bro’ after all.”

Jamie rolled her eyes and sneered. “Chloe, you’re his wife. He went missing three months ago. Instead of looking for him, you’re just planning a funeral?

“What if he’s not dead? Are you trying to wish him into his grave? What kind of a wife does that?”

I pulled the death certificate from my bag, laughing. “He's been under the snow for three months. I couldn't find him, so he's officially dead now.”

“That’s what everyone told me to do. To move on.”

When I’d gotten the bad news, I’d fainted.

The next morning all of Mark's friends were sitting around my bed.

""Honey, the area he went missing is really dangerous, it’s going to be hard to find anyone. Maybe you should just give up.”

""Yeah, it's a lost cause.""

I’d gotten up, booked a ticket, hired a rescue team and headed to the mountains.

For two and a half weeks I didn’t sleep or eat.

I hadn’t noticed then, how there wasn’t any panic in any of his so-called friend’s eyes. Just amusement.

Jamie’s jaw dropped, and then I heard a crash from inside her apartment.

She glared at me and warned, “Don’t pull anything stupid. When Mark gets back you’ll be sorry!”

I ignored her, like I had the night before, and walked away.

3.

The argument from behind her door was loud.

Now that he heard that I declared him officially deceased, Mark was starting to lose his mind.

But I wasn't going to let him find me.

If he could disappear for three months, I could certainly be gone for a few days.

I grabbed a packed bag and asked Sarah to book a hotel room for me using her name and ID.

I've been hiding out at the hotel for the past few days, buying funeral supplies and that's it.

Sarah showed up looking smug.

“I hear some dude is tearing up the city looking for you. Dude's flipped out. They're all over the news.""

I watched the news, seeing a missing person poster with Mark’s face and smiled. “He can look all he wants. I won’t let him find me. When he said he wanted to make me sweat and then come back, why is he sweating now?”

“He deserves it, the jerk. Why does the world have such awful men in it?”

She was getting worked up, and I had to cut her off, ""Hey, it's my husband's funeral today, I'm supposed to be sad, remember?""

I got out my makeup bag, and turned myself into a hollow, sad, wreck.

Once Sarah was certain I looked miserable enough, we left for the funeral.

On the way, I gave her a USB drive with all the videos of Mark and Jamie, and told her to play it when I gave the signal.

Only then did I send out the funeral address.

First to arrive was Ben. He stepped out of his black car and took a white flower from me, pinning it to his lapel. ""My condolences.""

Next came the clueless relatives.

Their grief was genuine, and it made my heart ache.

Mark, you fake your own death, and you hurt the people who actually care about you.

Today, you’ll pay for it.

Finally, his “bros” arrived.

They all looked pale and sick, and their hands trembled when they took their flowers.

One of them dragged me to the side.

“Hey, honey, you need to stop this! Mark is not dead! He’s going insane looking for you! Have you seen the missing person posters?”

I blinked, and let out two tears.

“Don’t try to cheer me up, those missing posters were Jamie’s idea.”

""A dead man cannot return to life. I’ve given up hope that he will.""

He tried to say something but I nodded to Sarah, who grabbed his arm and sat him down.

Once everyone had arrived, I got up on stage, and adjusted the mic.

“Thank you all for coming to the memorial service for my late husband...”

A scream cut me off.

“Chloe! What the hell are you doing? I said Mark isn’t dead!”

Jamie was standing at the entrance, glaring at me.

“Are you even his wife? How can you have a funeral when he’s been missing for three months? I won’t let you!”

I looked behind her. Mark wasn’t there.

So, even now Mark still wasn’t going to show his face.

I glared back at Jamie, “You won’t let me? Who are you to tell me what to do? You just said it yourself, I’m his wife.”

Jamie stared at me, tears filling her eyes. “How can you be so cruel? Mark loves you so much. How can you just declare him dead like that?”

“What if he isn’t?”

My eyes went to her marked neck and I smiled. ""Even if he isn’t, I don’t want to waste my time on a cheater.”

I had Jamie dragged off to a side and continued with the service.

I was about to say something when a disheveled looking man appeared at the door.

“Honey, I’m not dead! I’m back!”

Chapter 2

4.

Mark ran to me and pulled me into a tight hug, shaking as he whispered my name.

“Chloe, you have no idea how much I’ve missed you.”

“I fell while skiing and broke several bones. Luckily, a kind soul got me to the hospital. It took me three months to heal before I could see you.”

“I’m alive, look! I’m right here!”

He grabbed my hands and made me feel him all over, like he needed to prove he'd really had a brush with death.

I just watched him act.

Once he finally noticed how awkward he looked, I laughed.

""Are you done now?""

1lv7zig,https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/1lv7zig/hey_reddit_i_built_a_social_donation_app_called/,"Hey Reddit! I built a social donation app called ""hey!"" and need your marketing wisdom 🫒","Hey everyone! 👋

So I've been working on something pretty cool for the past few months (okay, maybe more like a year 😅) and I'm excited to share it with you all!



\## What is ""hey!""?

I created a social donation app called **""hey!""** where users can donate ""olive points"" that they naturally earn through everyday social activities like:

\- Chatting with friends

\- Posting on social media

\- Engaging with content



The cool part? You can donate without spending any money! and Anyone who needs help can create a donation project and receive these olive points from the Users. It's like turning your social media time into something meaningful! 🌱



\## The Journey So Far

I built this entire thing by myself—from planning and design to all the frontend and backend development. Honestly, it would've been impossible without the help of AI! (Shoutout to all the AI tools that saved my sanity 😂) Yes, I'm that crazy person who decided to solo-develop a social app. It's been a wild ride - lots of late nights, coffee, and probably way too much time staring at code. But hey, it's finally live and working!



\## The Marketing Challenge

Here's where I need your help, Reddit fam! The app is out there, but getting people to discover it is proving to be... well, let's just say it's harder than debugging that one bug that took me 3 weeks to find! 

I'm not exactly a marketing guru (I'm more of a ""build cool stuff and hope people like it"" kind of person), so I'm turning to you all for advice.

  
\## Why I'm Sharing This

I believe in the concept - turning social media engagement into real help for people who need it. But I also know that great ideas need great marketing to reach the right people.

So, Reddit, what's your take? Any marketing wizards out there who want to help a fellow developer figure out how to get this thing in front of the right people?



Thanks for reading my ramble! 🙏



\*P.S. If anyone's curious about the technical side or wants to know more about how the olive points system works, I'm happy to geek out about that too!\*

And, somehow, just a few words from Jamie had soothed him.Whenever he got mad at me, he’d make me spend the night thinking about what I did wrong. Only then he would forgive me.I closed my eyes, saved the videos, and set the phone down.Right then, Jamie called.I answered, and the loud music in the background nearly deafened me.Jamie was shouting. “Chloe! Are you planning a memorial service for Mark? Are you crazy? Cancel that thing now! If he ever sees it when he comes back, you’ll be sorry!”Before she finished, I hung up, grabbed a blanket, and crashed on the couch.It was the first good sleep I’d had in three months.The next morning, I went down to the courthouse to get Mark declared officially deceased.Once I got the paperwork, I went to Jamie’s place.Her front door was closed, and it took me several tries on the doorbell before I heard footsteps.She was wearing a silk robe, leaning against the doorframe, and there was evidence of a good time all over her neck and collarbone.“Oh, it’s you. What do you want?”I glanced at her neck, then her face, which held nothing but contempt.“I wanted to invite you to Mark’s memorial service. Seeing as you were his ‘best bro’ after all.”Jamie rolled her eyes and sneered. “Chloe, you’re his wife. He went missing three months ago. Instead of looking for him, you’re just planning a funeral?“What if he’s not dead? Are you trying to wish him into his grave? What kind of a wife does that?”I pulled the death certificate from my bag, laughing. “He's been under the snow for three months. I couldn't find him, so he's officially dead now.”“That’s what everyone told me to do. To move on.”When I’d gotten the bad news, I’d fainted.The next morning all of Mark's friends were sitting around my bed.""Honey, the area he went missing is really dangerous, it’s going to be hard to find anyone. Maybe you should just give up.”""Yeah, it's a lost cause.""I’d gotten up, booked a ticket, hired a rescue team and headed to the mountains.For two and a half weeks I didn’t sleep or eat.I hadn’t noticed then, how there wasn’t any panic in any of his so-called friend’s eyes. Just amusement.Jamie’s jaw dropped, and then I heard a crash from inside her apartment.She glared at me and warned, “Don’t pull anything stupid. When Mark gets back you’ll be sorry!”I ignored her, like I had the night before, and walked away.3.The argument from behind her door was loud.Now that he heard that I declared him officially deceased, Mark was starting to lose his mind.But I wasn't going to let him find me.If he could disappear for three months, I could certainly be gone for a few days.I grabbed a packed bag and asked Sarah to book a hotel room for me using her name and ID.I've been hiding out at the hotel for the past few days, buying funeral supplies and that's it.Sarah showed up looking smug.“I hear some dude is tearing up the city looking for you. Dude's flipped out. They're all over the news.""I watched the news, seeing a missing person poster with Mark’s face and smiled. “He can look all he wants. I won’t let him find me. When he said he wanted to make me sweat and then come back, why is he sweating now?”“He deserves it, the jerk. Why does the world have such awful men in it?”She was getting worked up, and I had to cut her off, ""Hey, it's my husband's funeral today, I'm supposed to be sad, remember?""I got out my makeup bag, and turned myself into a hollow, sad, wreck.Once Sarah was certain I looked miserable enough, we left for the funeral.On the way, I gave her a USB drive with all the videos of Mark and Jamie, and told her to play it when I gave the signal.Only then did I send out the funeral address.First to arrive was Ben. He stepped out of his black car and took a white flower from me, pinning it to his lapel. ""My condolences.""Next came the clueless relatives.Their grief was genuine, and it made my heart ache.Mark, you fake your own death, and you hurt the people who actually care about you.Today, you’ll pay for it.Finally, his “bros” arrived.They all looked pale and sick, and their hands trembled when they took their flowers.One of them dragged me to the side.“Hey, honey, you need to stop this! Mark is not dead! He’s going insane looking for you! Have you seen the missing person posters?”I blinked, and let out two tears.“Don’t try to cheer me up, those missing posters were Jamie’s idea.”""A dead man cannot return to life. I’ve given up hope that he will.""He tried to say something but I nodded to Sarah, who grabbed his arm and sat him down.Once everyone had arrived, I got up on stage, and adjusted the mic.“Thank you all for coming to the memorial service for my late husband...”A scream cut me off.“Chloe! What the hell are you doing? I said Mark isn’t dead!”Jamie was standing at the entrance, glaring at me.“Are you even his wife? How can you have a funeral when he’s been missing for three months? I won’t let you!”I looked behind her. Mark wasn’t there.So, even now Mark still wasn’t going to show his face.I glared back at Jamie, “You won’t let me? Who are you to tell me what to do? You just said it yourself, I’m his wife.”Jamie stared at me, tears filling her eyes. “How can you be so cruel? Mark loves you so much. How can you just declare him dead like that?”“What if he isn’t?”My eyes went to her marked neck and I smiled. ""Even if he isn’t, I don’t want to waste my time on a cheater.”I had Jamie dragged off to a side and continued with the service.I was about to say something when a disheveled looking man appeared at the door.“Honey, I’m not dead! I’m back!”Chapter 24.Mark ran to me and pulled me into a tight hug, shaking as he whispered my name.“Chloe, you have no idea how much I’ve missed you.”“I fell while skiing and broke several bones. Luckily, a kind soul got me to the hospital. It took me three months to heal before I could see you.”“I’m alive, look! I’m right here!”He grabbed my hands and made me feel him all over, like he needed to prove he'd really had a brush with death.I just watched him act.Once he finally noticed how awkward he looked, I laughed.""Are you done now?""""The kind soul that took you to the hospital...that was Jamie, right?""Mark froze.He tried to look confused. “Chloe, what are you talking about? I don’t understand.”I watched him fake confusion. After three months of being lied to, I slapped him.“You hid from me for three months. Why didn't you just stay hidden?""Weren’t you planning to show your face once I'd gone crazy looking for you? I'm not crazy yet.

1lv7vu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lv7vu9/my_exs_kid_is_staying_with_me_for_a_few_days_its/,My ex's kid is staying with me for a few days. It's causing some tension between me and my girlfriend.,"I was backing my car up my driveway after a long day of work, eager to get out of my uniform and onto the couch, when I first saw him.

There was a little kid, a boy, standing on my porch. 

Oddly, my first reaction was fear, though I couldn’t tell you why. But I could feel my heart speed up as soon as I saw his face pop up in my rear-view mirror. He was dressed in denim shorts and a red t-shirt, and a backpack was slung over his shoulders. His face was pale, and he had light brown hair peeking out from underneath a blue baseball cap. His eyes locked onto mine in the reflection as I put the car in park and pulled the keys out of the ignition.

I broke off the unsettling eye contact to glance up and down the street. *What if this is a robbery*, I thought wildly. *That’s a thing, isn’t it? Children used as decoys, to get your guard down?* I shook my head a little, realizing how ridiculous I sounded. *Jesus, I need to lay off the late-night true crime rabbit holes.* 

The street was empty, except a tabby cat wandering idly by the storm drain. I glanced back toward the boy as I gathered my duffel bag and laptop case from the backseat. Then it dawned on me, and I laughed at myself. Once every few weeks or so, I’d get neighborhood kids knocking on my door, asking to retrieve a frisbee or football or whatever else out of my backyard. My fence shared a side with two other yards, both of which housed apparently very social and rambunctious children,

Chuckling, I shut the car door a little too hard, sending the cat scurrying off down the street. I waved at the boy. “So what is it this time? Soccer ball?” I asked him as I stepped up onto the porch.

He cocked his head slightly. “Ball?”

“Yeah, did y’all throw something over the fence again? If you give me a minute to set my stuff down, I’ll grab it for ya.” That’s when I realized something. I couldn’t hear any kids playing behind the house. Besides a sprinkler across the street and a police car siren going off in the distance, it was quiet. I could feel myself getting a little nervous again, this time worried that this kid was lost or in some sort of trouble. I squatted down, concerned. “Hey, what’s your name?”

“Matt.” Something about him seemed familiar but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it yet.

“Alright, Matt, you okay? Where’s your parents?”

He shuffled his feet. “She brought me here.”

“Your mom, you mean? She dropped you off…here? Like on my porch? Why-” Then an idea hit me. The reason he looked familiar.

I tried to smile at him. “Is your mom’s name Jennifer? Jenny?”

He nodded. I sighed, probably failing to hide how frustrated this whole situation was making me.

Jenny was my ex. We didn’t date very long. I’m the one who called it off. She’d been great, at first, but it soon became apparent she had a serious drug problem. I couldn’t deal with the mood swings or the constant stealing and lying, so after a last-ditch effort to get her to get help- which she staunchly refused- I broke it off. *Damn, maybe this is a robbery after all* I thought darkly. Part of me still felt bad about dumping someone that was obviously in a bad place, but honestly, I just wasn’t equipped to handle that sort of thing. I was *also* not equipped to handle kids, and looking at Matt, I realized this was the longest conversation I’d had with someone other than an adult in years. 

I found out Jenny had a kid, or perhaps multiple, pretty early on in our relationship, but I never met them. They didn’t live with Jenny, and it was obviously a bit of a sore topic for her. When I asked, she told me that the dad was an asshole that refused to let her see them, and that was the first and last time it was brought up. Of course, later I’d realize the real reasons behind her lack of custody, but at the time I didn’t want to upset her so I didn’t pry into it further.

And here I was, still unable to shake her out of my life. This was really putting a damper on my plans of doing absolutely nothing on a rare stretch of off days.  I unlocked the door and walked into the house, setting my bags down inside. “You can put yours down with mine here.” No reply. I turned back and saw Matt had not followed me in yet. He stood right outside the doorway, head tilted, eyes on me. 

“Hey, come on inside. It’s getting dark out here and the porch light is busted.” I shepherded the boy into my living room and onto the couch. I sat across from him in an armchair. After a couple minutes of awkward silence, I asked him why Jenny had dropped him at my doorstep.

“There was no one else. None close enough.” Matt hadn’t yet blinked. His eyes were wide and dark. They reminded me of a shark, or some other cold-blooded animal.

I rubbed my eyes wearily and groaned. That didn’t surprise me. The only bridges Jenny *hadn’t* burned were shady characters that had no business taking care of a kid. Not that I had any idea how to, either, but at least she didn’t have to worry about Matt stepping on a dirty needle or seeing God-knows-what at a wild house party. And Marlene, Jenny’s mother- God, I did not want to have to deal with her again, but I figured she would be my best bet to pass along the kid. She lived about four hours away- likely why he hadn’t been dropped in her care to begin with- but I would be more than happy to make the drive. I just needed to call her to get the address. 

I glanced at my phone. Nearly 9 o’clock. I looked over at the boy. He’d been staring at me blankly the whole time. I’m not a fan of kids, to be honest- I don’t hate them, I’m just never around them much. But this kid gave me the creeps. I wondered why she had to leave him behind so quickly, and why he was with her in the first place. I hoped she had checked herself into rehab, getting help before she could talk herself out of it again, and not something nefarious. 

“Do you, uh, want some food?” Matt shook his head. “Not hungry? Okay. Are you tired? It’s getting kinda late. When’s your bedtime?” He shrugged. *This is like pulling teeth. Come on, Patrick, get it together. You’re the adult here.* 

I pulled out some spare sheets and an extra pillow, turning the couch into a makeshift bed. I opened the backpack and found a couple changes of clothes and some toiletries. I handed Matt a pair of PJ’s and a toothbrush and guided him to the bathroom. Once he shut the door, I wandered into my own bedroom and pulled out my phone. I tried calling Jenny first. **The number you are trying to call is no longer in service.** I wasn’t that surprised. Her not paying her phone bill, or losing her phone, had always been a point of tension while we were together. 

I sighed. Steeling myself, I dialed Marlene’s number. After a few rings, it put me through to voicemail. I left a quick one, stammering out a couple sentences explaining what was going on and to call me back ASAP, then hung up. 

*Should I call the police?* I didn’t want to get Jenny in trouble, not if she was trying to turn things around. Besides, I had no idea where she was currently since she moved to a new apartment after the breakup. I walked out into the living room and was surprised to see Matt already fast asleep on the couch. It hit me just how exhausted I was. It had been an insane week at work, and I’d put in a nearly 11-hour shift. Yawning,  I decided that I’d be able to deal with everything better after getting some rest. I double checked all the locks and then got into bed, leaving my door open a crack in case anything happened and Matt needed me. I passed out almost immediately.

“*Daddy. Daddy*.” 

My eyes shot open. The soft glow of the alarm clock illuminated a pair of eyes inches from my own. “Shit!” I scrambled upright. “Jesus, Matt, you scared me. I’m sorry.” I frowned. “I’m not your dad.”

The eyes stared, unblinking. ”Oh.” I could barely make out his outline in the dark. 

“Are you okay?”

“There’s a monster trying to get in.”

“Monsters aren’t real. You probably had a bad dream.” Like I said, I’m not great with kids. “Go back to bed, okay?”

“Can I sleep in here with you?”

“No, I don’t think that’s appro-”

“I can sleep on the floor.” I didn’t like the thought of that, but I was too tired to argue. “Okay, sure, I guess.”

Up until that point, Matt hadn’t been very emotive. He hadn’t laughed, or smiled, or cried. But when I said that, he grinned wide, and something about it made my stomach flip. Maybe it was the way the green light bounced off of his teeth, evoking the image of a cheshire-cat, or maybe a wolf. 

I stayed frozen as he disappeared beneath the side of my bed. I couldn’t see him, but I could hear his soft breathing, and every once in a while he’d make this odd clicking sound, the way one might against the roof of your mouth with your tongue. It took me a long time to fall back asleep, and when I did, it was fitful.

I woke to knocking on the front door. The clock read 11 o’clock. I must’ve slept straight through my alarm. Sunlight streamed in through the cracks in the blinds, making me squint. I peeked over the edge of the bed, half-hoping last night was just a weird dream, but the crumpled blanket and pillow were still laying on the floor. Matt, however, was not. 

I hastily pulled on some jeans and made my way to the front door. The boy was in the living room, staring blankly at the TV. It was off. “Morning,” I said, a little nervously. “Here, let me help.” I switched the TV on. A solemn-looking news anchor stood above a running banner reading **Suicide 'epidemic' has experts...** I quickly flipped through channels before landing on something more child-friendly. The knocking got louder. “Okay, okay, I’m coming!” I jogged to the door and cracked it open. 

“Were you still sleeping? It’s almost noon! What, did you forget your hot, awesome girlfriend was coming over?” She winked playfully, smiling.

I blinked, still groggy. Yeah, I had. With the long workday yesterday and all the strangeness of last night’s events, I had totally forgotten about our plans. Sheepishly, I grinned. “I’m sorry, it’s been a long night.” Her eyes wandered over my shoulder and her smile faltered slightly. “Who’s that?”

“Um, it’s kind of a long story. Come on in, I’ll make you some coffee.”

A few minutes later, I had gotten her up to speed. She did not look pleased. “How long is he going to be staying here?”

“Not long.” I answered quickly. “I mean, shouldn’t be.” I led her into the living room. Matt looked at us out of the corner of his eye but didn’t say anything.

I cleared my throat. “Matt, this is my… friend, uh-”

“Claire.” She interrupted, finishing my sentence. “Nice to meet you, Matt.” She wasn’t very convincing. *Maybe she thinks he’s secretly my kid.* She turned back to me. “So, now’s not a good time?”

“No!” I sputtered, “No, it’s fine. Stay.” I smiled weakly at her. ”It’s just for a few days, if that. I promise.” I felt claustrophobic suddenly. “Hey, I could do with some fresh air, get out of the house for a bit.”

Claire looked a little uncomfortable, glancing over at Matt. “I don’t know, maybe we should stay in…”

“We can grab a bite to eat, make a date out of it. My treat.”

About an hour later, we were all seated on the outdoor patio of a little cafe downtown. I had brought some paper and markers along, hoping to keep the kid entertained while we waited. A waiter brought a pitcher of water and a couple cups to our table. “Hey, we’ll actually need one more,” I gestured towards Matt.

 I was half-worried he'd ask us to put the markers away- the tablecloth was white- but the waiter didn't even look at the boy, just apologized. “I’ll bring another right away. Are you ready to order?” I nodded. “I’ll have the burger, medium-well, side of fries.” 

He scribbled away at his pen pad. “Anything else?” 

“Yeah, a chicken tenders basket with, how ‘bout the fruit cup , and uh-” I paused for Claire to order, but the waiter just kept looking at me expectantly. Claire cleared her throat and pointed down at my menu. “And a chicken caesar salad, please. Thanks.” I relayed her order to the waiter. He nodded and wrote the rest of it down. “Hungry, huh? I’ll have the extra glass out in just a sec.” 

He walked off and I poured some water for Matt and Claire, figuring it would be the chivalrous thing to do to wait on the third myself. As I was sliding the last one over to Matt- who was now fully absorbed in his drawing- a snippet of conversation caught my attention. 

“*...worried about her, you know. She called me up the other day to tell me her daughter was visiting, asked if I wanted to make the drive up to see them. But like, my aunt died nearly a decade ago.*”

I looked over out of the corner of my eye, not wanting to seem nosy. Two young women were sitting at the table across from us. One was nodding sympathetically, hand over the other’s.

“*Mine had memory issues, dementia I guess, towards the end too. It might be time to consider*...”

“Pat, are you with us?” Claire interrupted my eavesdropping. “I was asking you how work has been lately.”

Embarrassed, I turned my attention to her. I vented about my job for a bit and apologized again for forgetting about our date, which she laughed off. “It’s okay, Pat, don’t worry about it. We’ve been together for- well, a year next week, time’s gone by so fast, I know it’s not as exc-” her voice trailed off. I noticed the girls at the other table were now trying to steal glances at *us*, whispering among themselves nervously.

I followed Claire’s gaze to Matt. I had almost forgotten he was there. He hadn’t said a peep the entire time. He had the red marker in his hands and was putting some finishing touches on his drawing. I craned my neck to get a better view. He had drawn what looked like a crow, its eyes scratched out with little Xs. The neck flopped to the side at an awkward angle. He was dotting its head with the red ink, which I assumed was meant to be blood. 

“Hey, watcha drawing there?” I kept my voice light. 

He didn’t answer, just smirked slightly and kept working. He was holding his left hand rigidly under the table, something that I normally wouldn’t notice except his eyes would dart down to his lap every couple of seconds. Claire and I exchanged a worried glance. “Matt,” I said softly, “What do you have under there?”

He slowly raised his hand so we could see what he held. When I gasped, he dropped it quickly onto the table. It was a crow, its head twisted sharply to the side. A fleck of red smeared off onto the light tablecloth. “I found it.” That grin again. It looked so unnatural on the face of a child. 

“Alright, I’m so sorry about the wait sir, it’s been a busy- ” A glass clanged against the patio. Of course, the waiter picked the absolute worst time to return. He stared at the dead bird, then up at me. I apologized profusely, handing him my card and a hefty cash tip before asking to get everything to-go. He complied- quickly, this time- and I grabbed the bags in one hand and Matt with the other, quickly crumpling the drawing and shoving it deep into my pockets before ushering the boy and a mortified Claire into the car. 

Once the three of us were back home, I asked Claire to keep an eye on Matt and excused myself to try and call Jenny again. I turned on the TV in my bedroom on low to keep my voice from carrying into the living room. **The number you are trying to call is no longer in service.** I dialed Marlene once more and was robotically informed her voicemail was full.

 I slammed my phone down onto the bed. “Fuck!” This was *not* the relaxing time off I had hoped for. Of all the kids in the world, of course I get stuck with the poster boy for the next horror blockbuster.

“...*another strange case in which the would-be perpetrator tried to turn themselves in for, ultimately, a crime that police say never actually took place. The woman, whose name cannot be released at this time, said the boy claimed to be her nephew, whom she hadn’t*...”
 
I swiveled towards the TV, straining to make out the muffled words..

“....*after conducting an extensive search, it was determined that the teenager she claimed she killed most likely never existed in the first place. Neighbors report no*…”

The signal cut out for a moment. I heard a clap of thunder in the distance.

“...*claimed self defense, stating that the intruders exhibiting odd behavior posed an active threat to their lives. However, when they tried to show law enforcement the ‘crime scene’, the bodies seem, apparently, to vanish into thin…”

*What the hell?* I ran my hands wildly around the bed to find the remote, knocking it off in the process. Once I retrieved it, I turned up the volume a notch or two, hoping the closed door would still muffle it enough.

“...*follows on the heels of two other similar cases this week alone, though in the first we covered, a family member did report seeing the supposed female. However, their testimony has been called into question by*...”

“I know you’re not my dad.”

I jumped. Matt had the door slightly open and was staring at me through the crack. I hastily turned off the TV. “What?”

“I know you’re not my dad because my dad is dead.”

“Oh. I’m, uh, I’m sorry to hear that.” 

He stared at me for a very uncomfortable moment before closing the door. Once I heard the footsteps fade down the hall, I let out a breath I didn’t know I had been holding. I was shaking. *Get it together, man, it’s a kid. A creepy kid, sure, but his mom’s a crackhead, what kid wouldn’t be a little messed up in the head from all that.*

 I glanced at the dark screen of the now-silent TV. *And people have always been a little crazy. We’re only seeing these nonexistent patterns now, because we’re so connected, we have all the information in the world at our fingertips these days*...

Footsteps approached my room once again, followed by a soft knock. “Hey, it’s me. Can I come in?” To my relief, it was Claire.

“Yeah, no problem.” She sat on the bed with me, legs crossed. “I’m going to stay with you tonight. If that’s okay. Just in case.” She lowered her voice slightly, glancing toward the now-wide-open door. “That really freaked me out, at the restaurant. I’m not saying the kid is dangerous, but it wouldn't hurt to have an extra pair of eyes and ears, you know?” 

I nodded, kissing her forehead gratefully. “Hey, have you watched the news lately, by any chance?” 

“No.” She frowned. “Why, should I?”

I hesitated a moment before answering. ”Nah, things are so depressing in the world right now, it’s good to take a break.” I figured I was just being paranoid, and I didn’t want her thinking I was losing it. 

“Maybe you should take a break from watching, too. You seem tense.” She smiled thinly. “Also, I thought you said Jennifer had a daughter.”

“Did I?” I frowned. Jen and I had barely discussed her child. It was possible I hadn’t remembered correctly, or at all. ""Must've been mistaken.""

We ate our boxed lunch- now technically our dinner- in silence. Matt didn’t present us with any more dead animals, thankfully, but every so often I caught him shooting a dark look towards Claire. She didn’t seem to notice, and I didn’t want to bring it to her attention by calling him out on it. Later that night, I once again arranged the couch into a makeshift bed, and he settled in without complaint. I felt bad for him, then. He didn’t ask to be here. 

“Hey, I’ve been trying to get in contact with your mom and grandma. I know it’s no fun staying here. I’m sorry, I’m not used to kids around. I’m sure I’ll be able to talk to them soon, figure this out.”

“Okay.” Another soft click. I suppose he had a nervous tic.

“Try to stay out here this time, okay?”

“Okay.” 

His eyes again seemed to darken for a moment and I suppressed a shudder. I patted his shoulder awkwardly. “Alright, uh, goodnight then.”

Claire was waiting for me in the bedroom, sitting cross-legged on the bed. “Is this legal?”

“What?”

“I mean, are you going to get in trouble for having him here? What if your ex tried to say you kidnapped him?” She gestured vaguely towards the direction of the living room.

“And why the hell would she do that? She was upset about the breakup, yeah, but not *that* upset.” She stared at me as I talked, arms crossed. I tried softening my tone. “I mean, he’s just visiting. It’s not against the law to have a friend’s- er, acquaintance’s- kid at your house.” 

“I want him gone. Soon.” For a brief moment, an odd look passed over her face. It didn’t look like the sweet woman I’d been dating. I was taken aback. But then, it was back to normal, so fast I wasn’t sure I had seen it at all.

“That’s not really your call, is it? It’s my house.” It came out harsher than I intended. She was out of line, but I wasn’t trying to start a fight. I knew the kid was making her uncomfortable just like me.

She laid down and adjusted her pillow slightly and I saw something glint beneath it, reflecting the light from the lamp. “Claire, what’d you put under there?” When she didn’t answer right away, I pulled up the side of the pillow to see for myself. “What the *hell*, Claire? A knife?”

She stared at me, face unreadable. “It’s just a precaution. Like I said, he scared me earlier. I don’t trust him.”

“This is insane. He’s a little kid, Claire.” I was pissed, but half of the anger was coming from a little voice in my mind saying she might be right.  I pushed the thought away. “ Just leave if you’re that freaked out.”

She huffed and turned angrily to her side, facing away from me. I sighed and turned off the lamp, the cold pit in my stomach growing bigger. For once, the dark made me uneasy instead of relaxed. Needing a distraction, I rummaged around my nightstand for my earbuds, popping one in and turning my phone’s brightness all the way down so as not to disturb Claire. I scrolled through youtube shorts- I've stubbornly refused to download tiktok- and the comedy skits did help put me at ease. That is, until a weird one popped up.

The camera was pointed at an open front door, but from an awkward, low angle off to the side, as if the person filming was trying not to be obvious. I couldn’t see through the doorway from this vantage point, only a woman with her back turned towards the camera, holding open the door. Suppressed laughter kept causing the image to unfocus and shake. “*Jess, why’d you even invite her?*” Someone unseen whispered. Low voices agreed. I guessed there were three or four girls behind the camera. “*Dude, my mom made me, I think she feels sorry for her. I didn’t want to. She’s a total freak.*”

""*She's like the girl from the Grudge. Or, like, a vampire. For real, would it kill her to get some sun once in awhile?*"" One snickered.

I assumed the woman at the door was her mother. She was talking to whoever was outside. I turned the volume up, trying to make out what she was saying. “*...no problem at all. Both of you come right on in.*”

“*Oh my freaking god, no way. She brought an imaginary friend?*” Fits of poorly-muffled giggles all around. “*That’s so freaking crazy. Even for her.*” The mother must’ve heard the laughter, because she turned and shot a quick glare at the group. As she did, a small, pale girl appeared behind her, stepping through the doorway. The group hastily shoved the phone into the couch before she fully entered, video going dark. 

I thought back to my less-than-popular school days. Middle schoolers can be absolutely brutal, as I remembered all too well, but after recent events the video just got to me. A kid showing up randomly, acting creepy? It hit a little close to home. And, as silly as it made me feel...the vampire comment admittedly freaked me out. I thought back to Matt standing rigidly right outside the threshold, waiting for me to invite him in. How pale he was. *He didn't say Jenny was his mother. I assumed and he barely agreed...*

 I clicked on the account name. The most recent video had only been posted an hour ago, less than a day after the one I just watched. A girl’s tear streaked face filled the thumbnail. A small smear of something  suspiciously rust-colored dotted her t-shirt. I clicked nervously, but the video was stuck buffering. *Damn storm. I thought that 5G crap was supposed to fix all this.*

“Patrick. You need to get some sleep.” Claire’s voice was right by my ear. She laughed a little when I jumped. I closed the app quickly. My phone was about to die anyway, so I handed it to Claire, asking her to plug it in to the outlet on her side, and she agreed before rolling back over.  I shut my eyes, willing myself to sleep. Eventually, I did manage to pass out- for about an hour, until-

My eyes shot open. Something had woken me but I couldn’t immediately pinpoint what. I rolled over to look at Claire, but she was still facing away, sleeping peacefully. 

*click*

Matt. I squinted, trying to find his silhouette in the darkness, but couldn’t. I shifted uneasily.

*click*

“Matt, is that you?” I whispered.

No one answered, but I heard a slight rustling. I thought back to the other night, how he’d laid on the floor. I inched toward the edge of the bed and peered over, my eyes having adjusted to the darkness somewhat. Nothing. 

My stomach flipped as an unsettling thought popped into my head, and I slowly swung my feet off the bed until I was standing upright. It would be a tight squeeze, yes, but he was small enough. An image of him,  teeth bared sharp and limbs contorted tightly, flashed unbidden in my mind. I quietly got down onto my knees, craning my neck to look underneath the bed. I took a deep breath and swept my gaze back and forth and…nothing. 

*click*
 
The feeling of being watched raised the hairs on my neck. I whipped around, eyes landing on the closet. I saw something move behind the slats.

*Matt, is that you?”

*clickclickclickclick*

Heart in my throat, I closed the distance and threw open the door. Matt was crouched in the corner of the closet, wide-eyed. He held something tightly behind his back.

“Give it to me.” I spoke low but forcefully, hoping he couldn’t see how much I was shaking. “Now.”

He dropped a jagged shard of glass on the floor. I thought back to the shocked waiter shattering the cup on the patio. *Had he been hiding it this whole time? Why?*

I hurriedly scooped it up, nearly slicing my thumb open in the process. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” 

He held my gaze. “Killing monsters.” *click*

“Go ” I pointed towards the door. “Do *not* come back in here, you hear me? Stay on the couch and don’t move. I’ll be out in a minute to talk.”

He slunk past me quietly. I stood vigilantly by the door until I heard the creak of him clamboring onto the couch. *I can’t do this. I can’t. I’ve got to get him out. Tonight.* But where could I take him? I pulled at my hair in desperation. I glanced over at Claire. Still fast asleep, somehow.
 
*Call mom. She’ll know. Why haven’t I thought to call my own mother?* It was well past midnight, but where my mother lived it wouldn’t be much past 10. I padded softly to the side of the bed where Claire was sleeping, careful not to wake her. My phone was charging on the floor next to her. I unplugged it from the outlet and hurried into the hall bathroom, shutting the door behind me.

She picked up on the second ring. “Patrick!” She sounded panicked. “I’ve been trying to call you all night.” I frowned, pulling up the call logs. It was empty. “Honey, have you seen the news?”

Her anxiety was only heightening my own. “Yeah, a little, but hey, mom-” 

“Something is really wrong, hon. I wish you were here. I don’t like the thought of you living alone with everything going on.” She paused. “My neighbor- you might remember Betty- she died last night.”

“Oh my god, mom, what happened?”

“The police say she killed herself.” She sounded dubious.

“But you don’t think so?”

“Well, they found her hanging from the shower rod in the bathroom, you know, one of those actually built into the wall.” 

I glanced uneasily at my own shower. “So why don’t you think she did it?”

“It certainly looks like she did. But, Patrick, all these cases on the news…” She paused. “Betty had a visitor for a few days leading up to her death. She introduced him as her cousin. But…she’s told me before, both her parents were an only child.”

“Okay, so maybe second cousin or whatever they’re called. Mom, slow down, I need-”

“No, just listen for a minute. Our other neighbors, they didn’t seem to notice him. I mentioned him to Paul next door, and he said Betty didn’t have anyone staying with her. But I had seen both Betty and her cousin at his door earlier that day. It looked like Betty was returning a book she must’ve borrowed.”

She took a breath. “And then, she wasn’t reported deceased until her daughter stopped by to check on her. If this ‘cousin’ was staying there, he must’ve seen her body. The daughter- Anna’s her name- she said there wasn’t any signs someone had been staying there *at all*. She didn’t know her mother had any cousins, either. And, Patrick, there was no car besides Betty’s old sedan in her driveway the entire time. How’d he get there? How did he leave? I had seen him just the night before. It just doesn’t make sense.”

“Well, maybe he took an uber…” I trailed off weakly. I didn’t even believe that myself and I knew she wouldn’t, either. “Mom, make sure you keep your doors locked, okay? Don’t let anyone in if you haven’t specifically asked them over. Maybe call your friend, what’s her name, to stay with you for a while.”

She agreed, then asked, “Is everything okay? I’m glad you called, of course. But it must be, what, 1 o’clock over there? What are you doing up?” She paused. “I know things have been tough for you lately, with…you know. I worry about you, living so far away.”

I realized then I didn’t have the heart to scare her right now, not when she was already so worked up and couldn’t come to see me. “I’m just, uh, returning your calls. Seeing if you’re alright. Couldn’t sleep.”

After hanging up, I slumped against the tub, heart beating out of my chest. I had been hoping to get some advice, but instead our conversation had only cemented my suspicion, slowly building since that first day, that Matt wasn’t just a troubled child. He was something more, something potentially otherworldly, and he was dangerous. 

I had barely begun wrapping my head around all of this when I heard a yelp and a sharp crack, followed by a thud. *Shit, Claire! How could  you leave her alone?*

I raced back to the bedroom, flipping the switch to the overhead light. “Oh my God,” I breathed.

Blood was slowly soaking into the white sheets. Claire was holding her shoulder. “I had to. “ She looked at me blankly. “He stabbed me, Patrick, I was just trying to get him off me.”

I saw a pair of small feet peeking out beyond the end of the bed. Slowly, I walked around, revealing Matt sprawled across the floor. His neck was twisted unnaturally to the side. Blood flecked his lips. *Just like the bird* I thought feverishly. *Like the crow*

“He hit the bed post. I didn’t mean to.” I turned towards Claire. I stared at her, speechless.

I didn’t know what to feel. Seeing a dead child is absolutely horrific, of course, and his pale face burned in my mind. But... *was* he even a child? And for it to be self-defense…honestly, a very, very small part of me felt *relieved.* It didn’t have to be me. It was over. I swallowed the bile creeping up my throat, head pounding. “Claire, we need to get you to a hospital.”

“No!” She snapped loudly. She lowered her voice. “No, it’s not that deep. I’ll go wrap it up.”

I buried my face in my hands as she walked off. I knew I should probably call the cops, but they wouldn’t notice the body, would they? They’d throw me in the looney bin like they did all the others. I’d lose my job. I'd lose the house. My life would be ruined even more than it already had. *This is insane. This is way too insane. Oh my god, why did all of this have to happen to me? To us?*

When Claire returned, a bandage plastered neatly around her arm, she helped me strip the bed. We wrapped the body in the sheets and dragged it into the bathroom in silence. *The body will be gone in the morning. It will be gone like the others on the news. It was self-defense. He wasn’t human.*

Claire laid down on the bare mattress and closed her eyes. We were both exhausted but I knew I wouldn’t be able to sleep. I left her there and fell onto the sofa. I pulled up the search engine on my phone and typed **mystery visitor murder**. I needed answers. The screen loaded pages of results, all from the past month. The first one was a write-up recapping the news report I saw earlier in the day. A thumbnail of a low-resolution YouTube video read **kill or be killed** in bold above a conspiracy-nut looking dude miming holding a gun. I rolled my eyes and scrolled past, finally clicking on a short-form video that caught my eye. A manic-looking face filled my screen. 

“*Not everyone can see them. That’s how you can test it.*” The teenager talked rapidly as she filmed herself in a car. “I think, from the research I’ve done, the people I’ve talked to, my theory is that only people who have seen someone die, or dead, can see them. The visitors.*"" She sucked in a deep breath. “I saw my grandfather die when I was ten. I could see my ‘uncle’-” she threw exaggerated air quotations as she said this- “when I came home from school. Mom said he was visiting. I’d never met him before. When my brother got home later that night, he ignored the guy and just went to his room. I thought he was being an asshole like usual.”

 Her face screwed up, and she paused to wipe a tear running down her cheek. “My mom died that night. I found her in her bed. She had pills stuffed down her throat, the ones she keeps in her bedside table.” Another pause for another tear. She wiped it away angrily. “The police say she killed herself. That I invented this ‘uncle’ as a coping mechanism. My brother thinks I’m mental.” She looked straight at the camera, defiant. “But people will see soon. It’s all over the news, now. People are catching on. And whoever finds the body- well, now they’re suseptic-super-” she stumbled over the words for a minute. “They’re susceptible to them too, now. It’s an invasion. It’s spreading. Don’t invite them in.”

The video ended there. I sat silently, considering her chilling words. My mother and I were in a car crash when I was twelve. My dad, the driver, didn’t make it. What she was saying made sense, at least as much as anything else about this did.

My eyelids felt like lead and my head was pounding. The late and interrupted nights were taking its toll, insomnia slowing my thoughts to a dull crawl. Flashes of Matt's dark, lifeless eyes kept worming into my head. 

Somehow, I must have managed to fall asleep, because I woke to the sound of my phone blasting my ringtone in my ear. **Unknown number**. My stomach churned uneasily as I answered.  Birds chirped merrily outside the window. “Hello?”

“Hey, Patrick, this is Jen.” I sat up, suddenly wide awake.

“I’m so sorry I’m just now calling. I left the rehab early- my mother died, and I have to deal with her things. She, uh, killed herself.” Jenny started crying. “I’m getting myself on track, Pat, I swear. But it’s my fault. She’s been at the end of her rope with me for a long time now. I didn’t tell her I was getting help- I wanted it to be a surprise- and now she’s gone and it’s all my fault.” She hiccupped wetly. “I’ll come by tomorrow to pick up Matt. Like I wrote in the letter, he can be a handful, he hasn’t been right since he saw his dad die and I’m so sorry, but I really didn’t have anyone else, I just…”

She kept talking, but the ringing in my ears drowned her out. My mind was struggling to connect the dots. *Letter? What letter? Matt isn’t real. He doesn’t exist. Jenny has a daughter. He…he…* my eyes wandered toward the shut bathroom door. *No, no, no, Jesus Christ…*

“Patrick, are you still there? Is it okay to come by tomorrow around noon? That’s the earliest I can get there, if I could come sooner, I would.”

“I’ll have to ask my girlfriend,” I croaked out hoarsely. I walked dazedly into the bedroom, shutting the door behind me. Claire wasn’t in bed. I heard water running in the bathroom. 

“I didn’t know you had a girlfriend.”

“Yeah, uh, we’ve been dating for a year now…” an uncomfortable thought was trying to weasel to the front of my mind. *A year? But…*

“What? Pat, we broke up four months ago. Are you saying you were cheating on me? …Patrick?” The phone dropped out of my hand. I was suddenly aware how quiet it was. The water in the bath had been shut off. I held my breath.

“Patrick? Who were you talking to?” Claire’s voice floated from behind the door, low and cold.

*tap tap*

It didn’t sound like a knock. It sounded like something sharp against the wood. I shoved Claire’s pillow off the bed. The knife was gone.

“Can I come in?” I could hear the predatory grin in her voice. The true wolf in sheep's clothing. 

I sank onto the mattress, mind racing. 

*Your coworkers have noticed you’ve been depressed lately, calling out more often. People know it’s the anniversary of your dad’s death.*

I imagined her running the knife down my arms, propping me up on a pillow, wrapping my stiffening fingers around the handle.

*People will be sad, but not surprised. They’ll say the signs were there.*

I started hyperventilating. 

The waiter, the two women at the cafe… they saw me with Matt. They saw me turn to the empty chair next to me, talking aloud to no one.

*They’ll find Matt’s body. It won’t disappear, because he’s real. They’ll think you killed him, that you snapped under the pressure. They’ll say you couldn't handle the guilt once you came to your senses. *

Sour bile creeped up my throat. I felt like I was going to throw up.

*tap*

“You’ll invite me in.” A soft, cruel laugh. “I can wait all day. I’ll wait all night long.” 

And I believed her.

So that’s where I am now. I decided to take this time to send a message to my mom, to tell her I love her. I also spent a few hours writing this all down. I know I could’ve kept it short- and I know most people will think it’s bullshit, that I’m just trying to cover my tracks- but I really want you to *understand*. To put yourself in my shoes and see why things happened the way they did. Also, I took my time writing to delay the inevitable.

 I’ll be calling 911 shortly to let them know they’ll find two bodies. 

Because Claire is right. My life is over, one way or another. I *will* let her in. 

So, if anyone is reading this and you think you know me- if you’re a friend or loved one- I’m sorry. Jenny, I’m so unbelievably sorry.

It’s an invasion, and it's spreading. Be careful who you invite into your home.

I’m 24 (M) and just graduated college three months ago. With the gap years and mental health chaos, it took a lot of work. and I landed a full time, well paying job right out of college. I recognize I’m super lucky, but the hours are long and the pay is NOT good enough to support two people in the US economy.

My girlfriend (27 F), let’s call her G, also just graduated college, she got her first bachelors degree. She graduated with me. She only applies to jobs when I’m with her, prompting her to do so. It’s taking a strain on my own mental health since I’m worrying about my own future and about hers.

I’ve talked to her about it. She keeps saying she’ll do job applications on her own, then doesn’t. Just recently, we were gonna go to a library to body double so she can do job applications and I could do personal work. She bailed on those plans to get coffee with friends she just met last week with the saying “I wanna prioritize my social life.”

Her only income is doing her dad’s laundry. Shes literally doing her father’s laundry in order to fund this coffee get together.

I don’t know if I’m insane or overreacting about this. But it’s been three months of me CONSTANTLY trying to communicate and help her, and her constantly just not reciprocating.

Here is where the problem starts.

My dad goes ""You don't have ADHD! You don't have problems! God didn't make you sick!""

Immediately I felt like I was going to cry. I have all the signs of ADHD. I just want to get diagnosed so they can believe me and treat me well. I need them to take me seriously.

And them my mom comes into the picture. She says ""Thank God you kids don't have ADHD!"" 

It's not like it's some death sentence! It's not a terrible horrible thing! I tried to explain to them what it was, and so did my brother, but they were unwilling to listen and began yelling at us.

I am scared to tell them how I feel, and I most likely won't until I get diagnosed. They are unwilling to listen and learn. On top of that, they're verbally and emotionally abusive.

1lv7t2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1lv7t2o/the_scarecrows_watch/,The Scarecrows Watch,"My name’s Ben, and I was fifteen the summer I stayed with my grandparents.

Mom said it would be “good for me.” A break from the city life. Somewhere quiet after Dad died in that car crash. I didn’t argue. What was there to argue about anymore?

Their house sat on a couple dozen acres in rural North Carolina, surrounded by woods and with a massive cornfield that buzzed with cicadas day and night. My grandfather, Grady, still worked the land, even though he was in his seventies. Grandma June mostly stayed in the house, baking, knitting, and watching old TV shows on a television twice my age.

They were kind, but strange. Grady never smiled, and Grandma’s eyes always seemed to be looking at something just over your shoulder. The cornfield was their pride and joy. Tall stalks, thick rows, perfectly maintained. And right in the middle stood the scarecrow. I saw it on the first day I arrived.

It was too tall (like seven feet) and its limbs were wrong. Thin and knotted like old tree branches you’d see in rain forest videos. It wore a faded flannel shirt and a burlap sack over its head, stitched in a crude smile. I don’t know what it was but something about it made my skin crawl. When I asked about it, Grandma just said, “It keeps the birds out. Don’t want them crows eating our corn Benny.”

Grady didn’t answer at all.

But at night, I’d hear things. Rustling from the field. Thuds. Low groans, like someone dragging a heavy sack over dry ground. I convinced myself it was wind. Or raccoons. Or just being away from home, messing with my head. I just wasn’t use to the quiet at night. I was hearing things I never would or could in the city.

Until the fifth  night.

I woke up thirsty and walked past the kitchen window to get a glass of water. That’s when I saw it. The scarecrow wasn’t where it should’ve been. Now it was closer to the house.

It had moved. I blinked. Rubbed my eyes. But there it stood, just at the edge of the field now. Still. Watching.

I told Grady the next morning. He just looked up from his coffee and said, “Don’t go into the corn. Not unless you want to take its place.”

I laughed nervously, thinking it was a joke. He didn’t laugh back.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. So I did what every dumb kid in your classic Hollywood horror story does. I grabbed a flashlight and went into the field.

The corn was thick, and hard to move through. Every rustle made me flinch. I turned in circles, trying to find the scarecrow.

The corn stocks rustled just off to my left. I froze in place. My heart thudded in my chest like a jackhammer. I peeked a few rows over and there it was. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was… Walking.

Its feet dragged in the dirt, but it was moving, limbs twitching, head tilted unnaturally to one side. It stopped a few rows away from me, as if it knew I was there.

I didn’t scream. Hell, I couldn’t. I just turned and ran, crashing through stalks, until I saw the porch light. Grady stood outside, shotgun in hand.

“You went into the corn, didn’t you!?” he said, not angry. Just…

Behind me, I heard the rows rustle.

“You better get inside now,” he yelled. “It’s seen you!”

While it started with hope and connection, I now find myself emotionally drained, unappreciated, and unsure of where I stand. The imbalance has become increasingly clear — especially during a recent trip to Chicago that I planned and paid for entirely.

I spent over $500 on the trip, covering the rental car, gas, accommodations, food, and more. I didn’t expect her to split the cost 50/50, but I had hoped she would show appreciation in some form — maybe a coffee, a small gift, or just a genuine “thank you.” Instead, she didn’t offer to pay for anything, not even a cocktail. When she bought souvenirs at the museum gift shop, she didn’t think to get me anything — her explanation being that I wouldn’t have liked it. That may have been true, but it reflected a broader theme: she doesn’t really see me.

Throughout the trip, I carried the emotional and logistical weight. She had what she called an “autistic meltdown,” which left me to calm her down, find food options, and guide us back to the car — all while managing my own stress. Later, she got upset that I hadn’t made a dinner reservation, questioning my leadership. When I asked her on the drive back why she had considered breaking up with me previously, she said I made her feel “unseen” during Step 1 studying — even though I had communicated clearly that I’d be busy and still stayed in contact daily. Her reason felt like it shifted blame onto me, without acknowledging the support I was giving. For who dont know. Step 1 is a very hard medical school test. It take 3 months to study for it. So from April to May I stop planning dates and just would call and hang out at her house. She would cook for me and let me stay over. In june, she later admitted she hated doing that for me and she would never do it anything. I made her feel like less of a woman.

Back home, she didn’t text or call after the trip. Not once. After everything I put into that weekend, the silence felt like a slap in the face. I decided not to reach out first — not to play the emotional laborer once again. If she cared, she’d show up. But she hasn’t.

It has been 3 days since the chicago trip. I made a rule that I will not reach out until she text me first. I forgot to mentioned that she told me that I should text her good morning everyday or else she would not talk to me. I decided to break that rule since I feel like Chicago should have made up for my neglectful behavior in the past.

His leaf blower sat silently. The air no longer smelled of sweat, gasoline, and ethically questionable labor.

Panicked, I called his number. A deep robotic voice answered:

“This number has been detained and deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Press 1 to speak to a representative. Press 2 to feel overwhelming liberal guilt.”
I pressed 2.

My kale instantly wilted. My solar panels stopped working. The HOA sent me a violation for ""emotional disorderliness."" My neighbor Chad (who owns a crypto-startup called GringoChain) walked by and muttered, “Should’ve paid him in Dogecoin, bro.”

Now I’m forced to maintain my garden myself. My hands touched dirt. Real, actual dirt. I haven't been this humbled since I accidentally wore H-E-B sandals to Cosmic Coffee.

If anyone sees Juan Carlos Jesus Manuel, tell him I miss him. And I promise I’ll move the “Abolish ICE” sign from the backyard to the front lawn where it belongs.

Now I’m on my way to Home Depot to pick up a new Juan.

Enjoy long, aimless walks, learning about history and trying new foods. No day is complete without ample iced coffee and dessert.

I enjoy people who are kind, genuine and thoughtful. And a willingness to laugh at my stupid jokes.

My favorite places include bookstores, cafes and museums. Yes, you can see I am a very wild person indeed.

Physically, I am white with brown hair and eyes. Breathtakingly handsome. 5'4

1lv7mer,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lv7mer,My experience riding the California Zephyr from Emeryville to Chicago in coach class,"I wanted to make this post because when I was preparing for the trip, I didn't find too much detailed info on riding this route from West to East and in coach. A couple YouTube videos helped but overwhelmingly the comments were a bit discouraging. Im glad I did it anyway because I really enjoyed the trip! For context I'm an able-bodied 29 year old female and traveled alone, so obviously informs my physical comfort. 

Before leaving I packed the following:
- A large blanket
- A travel pillow
- Sleeping eye mask
- Ear plugs
- Fuzzy socks
- Sandals
- A set of pyjamas
- Two extra sets of clothes
- Snacks: grapes, Prunes, vegetable chips, and cheeze-its (I also bought a sandwich by the station before boarding for the first day's lunch)
- Body wipes
- Disinfecting wipes
- Hand wipes
- Hand sanitizer
- All the toiletries for morning/night 
- Kindle
- Headphones 
- A half gallon bottle filled with ice cubes

Obviously this is a lot of stuff but I genuinely believe this helped make the trip so enjoyable. Being able to change into PJs at night, clean my body down with the wipes, and mimic a normal sleeping routine really helped, as well as having clean clothes to change into since coach doesn't have access to a shower.

Food:
I had some snacks with me as mentioned above but I also got food from the café car. I had seen the menu online so I knew what to expect. Honestly, it was not as bad as I expected. I tried the Mac n Cheese, hot dog (I was super happy to learn the specific ones they had were kosher, since Im Muslim and can only eat halal or kosher), and garden salad. For breakfast on the 2nd and 3rd day I got the muffin, coffee and fruit juice. The blueberry muffin was amazing! Im going to Google where they're from after this, I miss them lol. The water I brought lasted me until the last day, then I asked the bartender in the sightseer car to fill it for me.

Entertainment:
I thought I'd get bored on the train, but truly I didn't. Just going back between the sightseer car and my seat, enjoying the views, listening to music and reading made it incredibly relaxing for me. I'm more introverted and only had a couple short condos with people, but next time I'll challenge myself to talk to more. I never once got the feeling ""when is this over"" like I do on planes.

Sleep:
The first night unfortunately, the AC in my car broke down. We went about 24 hours without AC so it did start to smell. They left the door open between cars which allowed some breeze in. The warmth was a bit uncomfortable, but I still managed to get maybe 5 to 6 cumulative hours of sleep. That was enough given I didnt need a tremendous amount of energy for the next day. I was also extremely lucky that the seat next to me was empty so I was able to lay down. I did sleep a bit funny on my shoulder and it hurts even 3 weeks later lol, but that's on me. I used the travel pillow and a rolled up sweater on the arm rest which made me feel like I was in bed. They also let the sightseer car open for people, some slept in there. When we got to Denver the second evening, thankfully they got someone to fix the AC. it took a while to cool down the car, but by nighttime was much more comfortable. Other than that, the movement and sound of the train kind of lulled me to sleep. I really recommend bringing an eye mask because the light is really annoying. I didn't use the earplugs but it does get a bit noisy so having those on hand is good too.

Stops:
I stopped at every fresh air break, including the ones in the middle of the night. This helped me to not get antsy which was my biggest fear going into the trip, as I tend to get cabin fever when I dont move a lot. That combined with being able to move around the coach car and sightseer car was great. We had a 25 min stop in Denver where I got some boba and snack. I also stopped by CVS to get Hand lotion because damn that amtrak soap is harsh! My hands literally started to bleed from dryness lol. That was the only thing id forgotten to pack

Bathrooms:
Obviously the bathrooms leave something to be desired and the water shooting out the faucets was a bit annoying, but overall it was fine. It didn't get as dirty as I expected tbh. 

We ended up arriving in Chicago about 2 hours late, which was good in my eyes, considering such a long route. The employees on the train were all great throughout. I really enjoyed this experience and Im excited to plan my next trip! I hope this post helped anyone who is considering this route in this direction! I had read some people say the opposite is better so you get through the less interesting scenery like farmland first, but actually I liked it this way because by the end I was kind of tired of gluing my eyes to the window and just chilled 😂 

Overall I rate the trip and 8/10. It was just the lack of AC the first night and the faucets in the bathroom that bothered me.

1lv7j79,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusTRT/comments/1lv7j79/what_do_you_think_my_chances_are_getting_trt_from/,What do you think my chances are getting TRT from a clinic?,"Hey guys,

I have been researching TRT for maybe 1 year now, on and off and I am now seriously jumping into contacting clinics. I already contacted one via e-mail yesterday PHC.

I just got my bloodwork done and got the results. Test taken at 10am, fasting.

I am 37m.

Results as of 9 July 2025:  
Total Test: 15.7 nmol/l  
SHBG: 18 nmol/l  
Free Test: 428.1 pmol/l

I did a test in Sept 2024 but that wasn't comprehensive, my total test was 10.5 and I don't know how my test increased cause I feel exactly the same. I didn't request anything else from the doctor, I was simply interested in my total test at that time.

Prior to those 2 tests, never crossed my mind ever to see what my testosterone levels are.

Thing is, for years and years, I have been tired everyday (don't drink coffee), sluggish, unmotivated etc..... Not to the point where I am bed ridden, but to the point where I don't want to go out with friends cause I am tired.

I wake up at least 8+ times per night, then go back to sleep 10 minutes after. This has been happening since I was a teenager and multiple doctors and myself can't cure it. A doctor even gave me this strong sleeping pull, while it did work to an extent, I woke up at least 4 times and when I woke up, I was so damn drowsy, it felt like I was on the last few seconds of sleeping gas, I was so surprise my body even woke up from that state a few times.

Apparently, my SHBG being 18 nmol/l, this should be a strong point to my case to try be on TRT.

If I do reach out to a clinic, I will most likely need to undergo another blood test and go from there? But has anyone been rejected from a clinic with similar results as mine?

Should I even bother? ",2,1752028306.0,AusTRT,7,1.0,False
