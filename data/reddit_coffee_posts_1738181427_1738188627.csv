I’m a stay-at-home dad with two kids under two, which means my days are a chaotic mix of diaper changes, snack negotiations, and existential crises brought on by The Wiggles. I love my kids, but let’s be real—my brain is slowly turning into puréed sweet potatoes.

I’m looking for audiobook recommendations to keep me motivated, creative, and maybe even help with my mental health. Something that inspires me (I’m a woodworker, currently on pause) but doesn’t require intense focus—because let’s be honest, I spend most of my day preventing my toddler from feeding the baby LEGOs.

I recently finished Paddle Your Own Canoe by Nick Offerman and enjoyed it, but I’d prefer something more educational and less memoir/biographical. I’m open to anything—business books that don’t feel like corporate fluff, creative inspiration that won’t make me roll my eyes, or self-help that’s actually helpful.

Any recommendations? Bonus points if it pairs well with cold coffee and whatever snack my toddler refuses to eat that day.",1,1738188437.0,daddit,0,1.0,False

When we talk in person or on the phone it is great, it feels like how we talked when we were together and sometimes it seems like she really misses me. However lately it seems like she isn't interested at all, taking hours or at one time even days to respond. I know she started a new job, but even when she isn't working she seems like she's ignoring me and responding with short answers or just liking the message. Like i said in person or over the phone our conversation are always great and i didn't really mind this behavior at first, but now it is confusing me.

I do know she probably feels guilty by the way she always asks if it is ok with me that we hang out, because she did hurt me by leaving me out of nowhere. But i do understand that she left me because of her past relationships, she was scared of commitment and confused, even tho she said i was the best guy she ever dated. I dont hate her for it, it was a shitty situation for the both of us.

We went no contact for a month and a half, two weeks after we broke up, before i reached out to wish her a merry Christmas. After that she initiated contact once because she wanted to hear me and later asked me if i was going to the concert that i mentioned before (i invited her to this concert even before we started dating), i told her that i was and that i bought tickets just a day before and she said she did too.

I think i might have messed up by suggesting no contact, because i was just too hurt at the time to only see her as a friend. I have come to realize i dont want to give up on us yet, i truly love her and miss the connection we had. I want her to be happy with or without me, but i need to try. What we had was the best time of my life and i believe she shared these feelings too. Maybe she still does. I dont want to lose her forever.

To elaborate more:

I have quite the mold situation. Quite honestly it is terrifying. I may make a separate post, but point is there’s a terrifying amount of mold I have to deal with in a bathroom that has been neglected for about half a year. 

To try to summarize it quickly: my in-laws left their house for half a year and my FIL seems to had forgotten to drain the bathtub after he used it, which has now turned into 6 months of bacteria growing into…scary stuff in a very very murky mass of water left. Also, the shower seems to have never been cleaned and has a bunch of black mold so now that needs addressing too. Apparently they never noticed it because of their eyesight. 

Very gross, I’m very scared. 

For the bathtub: I plan to use a mesh strainer lined with a cheesecloth or coffee filter to scoop out the…fungi?mold?… floating on the surface. Then, I don’t know if I should drain the bathtub or use a wet/dry vacuum to suck out the remaining murky water? What’s the best way to clean out all the mold/gross buildup in the bathtub pipes? The water level is pretty low now, I think part from evaporation part from gradual leakage/drainage from the bathtub plug into the pipes. And then, how would you deep clean the tub?

For the shower: I was thinking of using zep for a first round of cleaning and then Irish spring 5in1 cause the results of IS51 look incredible. 

Also question on scrubbing tools: is there a real difference between sponges? I see a lot of refs for like scrub daddy, magic eraser, but what makes them so special and which one should I go with? I usually use the scotch-brite dish wand cause it has a handle. Would that be okay or is there actually something superior about the scrub daddy or magic eraser?

And are sponges better than brushes?",1,1738188116.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False

Confession: I’ve been coding like a gremlin for the past month, surviving on cold coffee and chaos, to build **IdeaHive** 🐝—a place where you can *publicly share your project’s journey* and turn your audience into collaborators.

**The good news:** It’s working (sort of).  
**The bad news:** My dog is my only beta tester, and he’s more interested in chewing my laptop charger.

**I need YOU**—yes, you, the person reading this—to poke holes in this thing. Break it. Yell at it. Tell me why it sucks. Or, if you’re feeling generous, tell me what *doesn’t* suck.

# Why bother?

* **You get:**
   * **Free ""OG Alpha"" status** (future bragging rights + forever-free premium features).
   * **Influence the roadmap** (I’ll literally add a “/rant” button if you ask for it).
   * **A front-row seat** to watch me panic-fix bugs at 2 AM.
* **I get:**
   * Feedback that’s not from my mom (she says it’s “very nice, sweetie”).
   * Proof that I’m not just screaming into the void.

# How it works (for now):

1. **Sign up** [here](https://ideahive.one/sign-up) — takes 10 seconds, no credit card, no soul-selling.
2. **Post your project** (even if it’s just a half-baked notion doc and a dream).
3. **Share updates**, collect feedback, and pretend you’re a tech influencer for a day.

# The catch:

This is **alpha software**. Translation:

* The UI looks like a toddler’s finger-painting.
* Some buttons do nothing (surprise!).
* You might accidentally summon a demon (not tested yet, but possible).

# Who should join?

* Indie hackers who **build in public** (or want to start).
* People who think “MVP” stands for “Minimum Viable *Pain*.”
* Anyone who’s ever thought, “I wish my audience could watch me suffer through this feature.”

# TL;DR:

Help me make IdeaHive less terrible. In return, I’ll give you a platform to flex your project *and* a community that cares about your progress. Deal?

People with their hopes and dreams, ambitions, and vision for the future. Who for some reason see life as this big wonderful, meaningful experience. 

I see all of this shit as completely pointless, and genuinely don't care if I live or not. I'm in no way S\*icidal, but i don't care about living either. I do whatever I want, and live entirely in the moment. I drink on weekends, i workout because I like how cardio makes me sleep better during the week, and I drink a ton of coffee. I do my work, and go home at night. I play video games. I just exist. No bigger purpose, no plan. 

Which is why i firmly believe that I will be cursed with a long life. Even with all the cancer increasing risk factors i do like drinking alcohol. I just KNOW ill never get cancer. I don't see life as this big great wonderful thing, and because of that I wont be a victim of such irony. 

There is no reason to fear life ending diseases because life is 100% luck you either get lucky or unlucky. Just do EXACTLY what you want to do every day, don't care or think about the future at all because your actions are futile and you are here for no reason other than to consume resources. People say you increase your risk by doing certain things, but what they really mean is that instead of a .0005% chance of getting stomach cancer, you now have a .001% chance of getting stomach cancer if you drink alcohol. Still negligible. I dont believe risk factors to be a factor at all. I will either get it, or I won't. And I think I won't because I have zero lust for life. ",5,1738187953.0,nihilism,4,1.0,False

I'm brand new to websites, trying to drag our 3rd generation family business into the current century.

I elected to use Wix, no real reason why and I'm starting to regret it!!

  
I'm a child of the 80s and have grown up using windows PCs from the 386 Win3.11 days through to current, part of my organised life on PCs is tree structures, logical places to keep things. Now as you all know Wix doesn't support common sense in this way, so how do I best go about structuring my site?



I currently wish to have, as an example:

(Main) Appliances >  (Lvl1) Food Prep and Coffee > (Lvl2) Stand Mixers > (Lvl3) KitchenAid 125



But in the the mighty Wix I can only have the completely unstructured:

(Main) Appliances > (Lvl1) Food Prep and Coffee  (Lvl1) Stand Mixers  (Lvl1) KitchenAid 125

  
I've been trawling through google trying to find a solution but haven't been able to, horizontal menu is the only thing I can find, but that still doesn't organise the site for me

1id5sle,https://i.redd.it/6slahlte80ge1.jpeg,M/24/5'9 [212lbs > 172lbs = 40lbs] (36 months) Face gains after losing 30+ lbs these last four months. About 15-20 to go. Think I hit a plateau. Long time lurker and I need accountability to finish what I started,"How I lost 30+lbs in 16 weeks:
- calculated my metabolic rate and adjusted my CICO as weight changed (I did a rather agressive deficit)
- boxing classes (>= 3x per week)
- weights (3x per week) (increased mass by 5lbs about once a week but only when I felt comfortable)
- running (10% weekly mileage increase) (90% zone 2 training)
- stationary bike (1hr 2-3x per week)

What I've didnt expect after losing 30+ lbs:
- cold most of the time (live in midwest)
- had to go down a ring size
- stamina is fun
- is your ass supposed to hurt when sitting?
- I dont sweat nearly as much as I used to (bye bye swamp ass)
- appetite for fast food is diminished, but put cheese curds in front of me and I'll fold like a chair in a church basement
- maybe I don't have ADHD (aka I can focus now)
- newfound confidence (would not recommend losing weight if you have a superiority complex)
- talking to strangers is cool
- ""wait, was she flirting with me?""
- ""wait, was he flirting with me?""

Tips:
- low calorie snacks: low-fat cottage cheese, sugar-free jello, rice cakes, grapes, apples, watermelon, unbuttered popcorn
- low calorie/nutritional ingredients and meals: low-carb tortillas, whole wheat bread, oatmeal, skinny noodles, tomato soup, garlic
- dry-bag in your gym duffel is very very useful for keeping your sweaty clothes sans-workout
- try intermiddent fasting. Start with 8-16. Doesnt take too long to get used to it
- theres a difference between taking a rest day bc youre not motivated and taking a rest day bc you really should take a rest day. Be honest with yourself
- remember the dry bag for the sweaty clothes? For the love of all things holy do not forget to empty it when you get home
- shin splints suck but they get better if you actually listen to your body for once
- for cardio in the gym, watch a tv show/movie on your phone or tablet. Helps pass the time.
- dramatic changes in the scale are normal. Its mostly water and food weight. Keep a log and track the averages throughout the day/week/month and you'll get a better idea of your progress.
- dont starve yourself. Just don't. You'll actually hinder your progress. Only do the deficit you can handle.
- plateaus are also normal. Just stay consistent and you'll eventually get out of it
- losing too much weight can do more harm than good. Take your time. Do your research.
- learn about BMR, body fat %, zone 2 training, and good nutrition (there is a BIG difference between good nutrition and just calorie counting)
- based on independent study, garmin watches are more accurate than apple watches, but apple watches will do the job if you have one (just take the gps/distance readings with a grain of salt)
- for cardio, consider investing in a decent chest heart rate monitor
- switch up your routine every once in a while. When your body gets used to the same repetitive workout, its harder to lose
- focus on smaller goals rather than the end goal. In my calendar I schedule weigh-ins for every 10 lbs.
- It's not the worst idea in the world to schedule a week where you purposely don't lose weight and just let your body get used to the changes you put it through. After all, once you hit your end goal you'll need to maintain it so you dont gain it all back
- for weightlifting, I suggest focusing more on reps than mass. Sure you can have PR goals, but more reps with lower mass is where you can really see progress
- consistency really is key
- you'll probably lose a few extra pounds during the first few weeks. Hate to tell you but its mostly water weight.
- you'll hear that cardio is not the great for weight loss. Thats only true if you ONLY do cardio. Muscle burns more calories at rest than fat does. If you only do cardio, you'll lose weight but your metabolism won't change very much.
- strength train your legs if you want to avoid injury while running
- a food scale really does help count calories. You'll be surprised just how much you consume if you eyeball it
- olive oil has a LOT more calories than you think it does
- only get 92-96% lean beef
- wild caught fish are much better for you than farmed fish (but sadly more expensive)
- take it easy on the coffee creamer and sugar, and refrain from starbucks
- gym buddies are great but dont rely on them. Just because they can't make it doesn't mean you can't go to the gym. Most people are cool with spotting if you just ask them.
- give yourself a micro-challenge every now and then
- MyFitnessPal is a godsend if youre doing CICO
- take videos of yourself working out (if your gym allows it). Its fun to post on IG but its also good if you're trying to improve your form
- most spices are no/low calorie. Dont be afraid to sprinkle that paprika
- hot sauce is also low calorie. Use to your heart's content
- unfortunately, many nutritional ingredients and whole foods are expensive. I recommend only getting what the recipe requires if you're on a budget
- I dont usually do cheat days, but its totally okay if you do. Just don't go nuts with them
- motivation only gets you started. It runs out quick. Build habits and discipline yourself to keep at it. Eventually, not going to the gym will feel weird
- take the 'lose fat quick' and the 'brand new sportsmodel diet' with a HUGE grain of salt. IMO they're just corporate BS trying to sell you something
- you know that super weird fitness equipment you see on Amazon that targets abs or whatever? Dont waste your money on it. Sure they could help, but honestly you'll be fine sticking with the tried-and-true exercises. Once you get to a point where you are more about maintenance than fat loss and want to target abs or biceps or glutes, you'll already know enough to know what equipment you should buy.
- planet fitness is $10/month. And you probably already have some clean shoes. You don't need to break the bank to lose the poundage
- I recommend going sober during your transformation. Most alcoholic drinks are high in calories and carbs. I drink a beer maybe once a month and only if I'm in a social situation.
- this one may just be me, but getting used to being sweaty takes getting used to. I used to hate getting sweaty, now i use it as a tool to measure how hard I work


Thats abt it. Sorry for the info dump I'm nothing if not thurough.

1id5sdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1id5sdm/ive_been_struggling_with_the_loss_of_my_wife/,"I’ve been struggling with the loss of my wife. Lately I haven’t been able to leave bed. I have found journaling/writing as a distraction, and would like to share an experience I wrote about. It’s about our cat and self care.","Our Cat

Tail pointed high, seductively strolling by. He effortlessly hops onto the bed and nuzzles that soft noggin into my hand. He’s decided I’ve been laying about too long. I pull the sheets over my head, initiating a game he likes to play. He gives a quick exhaled “mew” and paws with is little claw at my shoulder. “No, go away.” I say. This time his reply is a long exasperated “Meeoooooow”. Followed by that little noggin tunneling his face into my blanket cocoon. I lift a corner of the sheets. He crawls in and curls up with his back to my chest. He exposes his belly with its multiple coats of fur- allowing me to pet him as he purrs. I don’t know if this is all a game for cat treats or if he actually enjoys my company. Regardless, I pay my debt. He excitedly gets his reward and heads to the next room.

I feel sorry he’s stuck with me, I was always his second favorite in his small world of two humans. It’s been a long time since he’s seen his “mom”. I wonder if he thinks of her or just assumes she will come home soon enough. It’s not unlike her to be gone for long periods of time. 

I remember when his mother returned home after being away a couple of months. She entered, bald and smelling of toxic chemicals. Just wanting to cuddle her favorite friend. He was such a brat. He would mope about the house howling his long drawn out meows as he plopped on his side far out of reach but well within sight. Giving an enticing side eye as if to say “ I’m disappointed that you’ve chosen to be gone so long. Only to return, a new person… but I do kinda want your attention though.” He spent almost an entire week craving affection but not giving any. It was his way of protest I suppose. He despises new people although he’s never had a traumatic experience in his life. Every time the doorbell rings he darts under the bed. He just needs a lot of time to warm up to someone; you gotta earn his love. I will tell you that they had quite a relationship. I’m referring to his favorite person in his small world of two. He was putty in her hands. They had their own routines and funny games, especially since they got to spend a lot of time together when I was working out of town. She called him “The Baby”, and it stuck. 

The Baby loves strings. Strings… you may ask? He’s not a very smart cat. If he can pull a thread from clothes or find some ribbon, or rubbish. He will try to swallow it. You’ll have to fight him tooth and claw to extract the wet thread he’s gaging on. He’ll follow you to the trash, sit down with a scowl as you toss his treasure away. This is usually followed by some sort of retaliation, he may wage war on my plants or claw the quilted bed comforter, where he can extract little cotton strings that he’ll lick and naw at, smacking his tongue on the roof of his mouth, creating the most obnoxious noise. My wife kept these tiny red scissors in her night stand just for this reason. She would snip away the white, wet fibers as she chided him. We all knew this wouldn’t stop him.

The Baby would only get in her lap, or sit like a loaf of bread with the smirk of smug king atop her back, as she would lay reading a book. It took me many years and many more cat treats to get the same treatment, although he didn’t give me the same quality as he did for her. I was more of a “Play daddy” to use her words. She was more for love, cuddles, and care.  And it was true, I knew how to rile him up with his favorite toy. Which was a fuzzy worm attached to a stick with a long piece of string. We would die of laughter when he would tire out, and take the worm in his mouth and try to walk away with it as he panted. I would give some resistance and he would turn and face us, Pulling with all his might, digging his claws into the carpet making the stick bow as if he were a fat fish on a hook.

The effort and care she put into maintaining his fluffy fur, was admirable. I would love watching them on those bright weekend mornings. I’d have the windows open in our tiny apartment— that felt more like a treehouse with its many windows on the second floor of our small city. I would be brewing some coffee in the kitchen and would peek into the bedroom. She would be gently talking to him in that melodious voice of hers. Asking for his cooperation as he was on his back in her lap, legs spread out like a plump turkey before being seasoned, cocking his head upside down looking at her as she brushed from under his chin to his belly. I’d know soon enough I would have to come in and hold him down for those difficult to get areas. He would fight and squirm in my arms and then in hers, we’d take turns talking to him and brushing him out. Giggling the whole time. And afterwards, we’d lay in bed drinking our coffee and picking the stray fluffy orange and white hairs from each other. It would be minutes after we had thought we’ve gathered them all up before we’d see a little cloud of floof floating about the room drawn up by the cool summer breeze. I could picture this mundane morning of ours as if it had just happened.

In bed alone, picturing these memories and thinking of our small happy family. I think of our orange boy, and how she never got to say goodbye. He doesn’t know she’s not coming back… I sat up in bed and run my hand across the comforter. I feel those little wet spikes of cotton he’s pulled out. It seems he’s been protesting for a lot of days now. There are so many of them… how could I let it get this bad. I go for the scissors in the night stand. Her scissors. Her nightstand. I hesitate to open the drawer with all of her things just as she’s left them. The extra treats, the brush, the lint roller and her many little “doodads”. I slowly grab the scissors and begin to cut away at the strings, noticing some have crusted dry due to sitting for so long. Next thing I know, The Baby’s jumped back in bed because he’s heard the treat drawer open. I pause frozen in the moment. He doesn’t know that we lost her…. I dump a pile of treats and dry my eyes before a drop can escape. I notice his thick fur is a-bit tangled, some spots matted around his legs. He needs to be brushed… so I take out the brush as carefully as I can from the drawer and start to brushing. He purrs at first then after a while he’s over it, especially when I start cutting away some matting. At this point I’m wishing I had a second set of hands. My heart is hit with an unbearable pang… I give in, and pour a mound of treats on the bed. He doesn’t usually get such a haul and he’s greedily chowing it down as if I’m going to snatch some away. I was able to remove enough hair to create a whole other cat. It’s been too long, and I remember her specifically asking me to please do this when she’s gone. I feel shame and embarrassment sending yet another pang- Feeling like needles are being thrust into my heart.

I clean up and meticulously replace the items just as she left them. I stare off in a numbing daze for a while before I head into the kitchen. I gotta check his food and water… She would never let the water bowl look like this. I thought as I looked down. I go to clean the water bowl in the sink that’s piled up to the brim with dirty dishes. She wouldn’t let this happen either… I wash the bowl thoroughly and leave my dishes for another time. Meanwhile, The Baby is in the door jam plopped on his side looking up at his favorite worm toy hanging from the top of the doorframe. I haven’t played with him in ages. I can see he’s been protesting, as I look about the room and notice the nibbles on the leaves of my neglected houseplants. “I’ll water them later too…” I tell myself. I decided to at least give them some light after noticing my home is dark and stagnant- The blinds are down, and every curtain closed. I open the necessary ones and on my way out I give The baby a pat with my foot as I step over him through the doorway making my way to the bathroom. 

What I see in the mirror is a disheveled broken man. The Baby jumps up on the vanity asking for “drips” as she use to call them. She would turn the faucet on very low and allow him to lick at the falling droplets. I turn the nob and let the water slowly stream in a narrow line. He’s got two feet in the sink, the other two planted on the counter, his tail hooked in the air, and his head cocked completely sideways splashing water all over the damn place as he try’s to lap it up with his flailing tongue. I couldn’t help but smile… then suddenly, I breakdown into uncontrollable sobs and lower myself on to the edge of the bathtub. The needles feel like a knife. He doesn’t know, and he probably wouldn’t understand. He’s too dumb to understand but he’s working with what he has. Right now he has me. And I think to myself, when was the last time I had water, food, took care of my hair, or let in some light?… When have I found joy in a single day since she’s been gone, let alone tried? My poor cat… no our poor cat... In my protest he suffers… as do I... As do I? In his simple protests I’m only inconvenienced. How cruel I have been to this innocent creature…. I will do better for you both! I sprang up, shut the water off and take him in my arms. Still sobbing I speak to him “I’m sorry…. I’m sorry she not coming home and I’m sorry you’re stuck with me”. He absolutely hates this and thrashes himself free, leaving me to face my reflection alone again. 

I stop and stare at myself and notice my puffy eyes, wild hair, scraggly beard and the tears dripping from my chin. I grab my clippers and begin to shave upwards from the neck watching as the tears stream and fall along side the scruff from my face. ",3,1738187673.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

The way I see it till the water boils through the coffee it's not interacting with the beans in any way so all the energy and time raising the temperature of the water from cold on the stove is wasted. 

It's only when the steam/water is going through the beans and condescending aga in as it gets to air pressure after sprout that anything is physically or chemically happening

But there are people who swear by starting with cold water and bringing it boil on the stove, but can't understand why and how it would add any value


On a similar note, physically is it steam going through the beans that condenses again or boiling water but still in liquid state?",2,1738187653.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

So I designed this little shelf - total width is 60cm. Grid height is 4mm. I'm from the US, but prefer designing in metric ;)  
  
The shelf itself is 3 pieces wide that connect with rectangular rods. I haven't used any glue because I feel a bit guilty :) but I may use some glue if they work their way apart after some use. I'll try slightly larger rods first, though.

I'm also going to make a bin for the small tea packs.

Thoughts/suggestions appreciated.

Pretty much every item of furniture will be replaced eventually (I have a cozy MCM vision in mind). 

We’re currently using the space to watch movies and play video games, so we furnished it minimally with random pieces of furniture that we already owned. I plan to replace the sofa with an L-shaped sectional, get a nice tv stand that can also house my vinyl records, get a bigger coffee table, and reupholster the armchair.

I have a feeling that the TV should be on the wall with the window to reduce glare, perhaps in the corner? ",3,1738187576.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

1id5pry,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1id5pry,Can anyone ID this coffee table and end table?,"So, I just got a ton of furniture from a relative who passed away late last year (ignore the mess and temporary placement/set up of all of it lol) but for the life of me, I can’t find this coffee table and end table anywhere online.

I unfortunately don’t have any info on it beyond my relative did buy nice things. The sofa I got from her is from Herman Miller, I got multiple dining chairs by Knoll, etc etc.

The coffee table and end table base folds like in that last pic. The bolts are hidden on the bottom. The base is rather heavy so it’s very solid wood. The glass is pretty thick too. But there is no markings on the wood base or glass anywhere that points to a manufacturer.

The wood has some wear/scratches on the very bottom and the glass has some minor scratches too. She had no kids or dogs and everything else I got from her, minus the Knoll chairs that need caning repair, are in excellent condition so I’m guessing the tables could be pretty old.

2. You complain to a friend about how your cat keeps meowing at night and your friend bluntly goes ""your cat's fat."" Or other very bluntly honest things without trying to make it sound nice.

3. People don't use their turn signals, honk if you're driving too slow, use the shoulder to cut past traffic and go an average of 20-40 over

4. Someone doesn't want you in a group so when you ask to be part of it they just say ""no.""

5. You're at a counter service place and the cashier without a smile, and with his head resting on his hane goes ""um...can I help you?"" in an annoyed way

6. You're trying to take a picture in front of a tourist thing and people keep walking between you going ""excuse me!"" And then someone goes ""jesus fucking christ"" and pushes through

7. At a coffee shop, the cashier sees a customer acting dumb and instead of saying ""can you please behave better"" they scream ""GET OUT!"" Repeatedly in front of the other customers. 

8. People talking on their phone on crowded buses and trains, and not giving up their seats for elderly or pregnant people.

I was diagnosed with fibro as a late teen and I’m now in my late twenties. I also have M.E which leaves me exhausted all day. I manage to work part time from home/bed as my workplace is extremely flexible and understanding of my conditions. I just feel like my life is working from bed, resting in bed, sleeping, and struggling to shower, make food, go outside. I go out for appointments and meet up with a friend for a couple of hours every 3 months, that’s my social life lol. 

I’ve seen physios, rheumatologists, osteopaths, talking therapists, pacing therapists, Access to Work, and an OT. I just feel like I get passed around and no one actually listens to my needs. I am in constant pain no matter how I sit or what type of chair I sit in and I can manage 30 mins to an hour of sitting up before I start to sweat and feel dizzy so I have to lie down frequently. Access to Work have told me there’s nothing they can do to help me work lying down, I hoped my OT could recommend a recliner as I don’t know what I need really. My GP also mentioned it because they think as I work in bed it’s messing with my sleep by not separating the two. The OT said it would be worse for me to use a recliner as I need to keep moving my body, but also affirmed what my GP said about it not helping with sleep so I’m just so lost on it all. I get it and I understand where they’re coming from but at this point I just want something comfortable to sit in so I can focus on my work (I love my job and I’d be devastated if I had to leave because no one can help me find the right working accommodations). I have been using an ergonomic desk chair from Access to Work and I developed a trapped nerve in my neck which has been causing me agony over the past year. This was diagnosed by a private osteo in the end as no one in the NHS would listen to me and kept telling me it’s my fibro (my neck, shoulder, and arm burns if I use my hands to move a mouse or hold a controller). 

I’m told to pace my energy and not push through pain, but in the same breath they’ll tell me not to rely on my wheelchair too much and that I’m in pain because I’m too sedentary. I have insomnia and am awake until 6am most nights, I’ve been told I just need to get more sunlight and go outside for a bit when I make a coffee before work! Yet they don’t understand I barely wake up in time for work so where do I start. I can mobilise and my joints work fine, they just cause pain. I felt really brushed off by my OT, I wanted help showering because my arm pain makes washing my hair painful and my hand pain makes preparing meals painful, but my dexterity is fine so they just ignored me and said they only fund equipment like stools. They said it’s more a case that I need to get my pacing in control and referred me back to a pacing therapist that I’ve already seen - who never saw my home environment and how I engage with the world, it was just writing a log of what I did and showing me the boom and bust cycle. Is it just the UK? I’ve never had a professional discuss mobility aids, shower stools, grab bars, ect. I’ve just bought these things myself over time, no medical professionals even told me that the council can send an OT to my home for an assessment until I found it myself.

I rely on my partner to help with everything and I have lost so much independence. I’m able to mentally manage working, it’s just my physical space and chronic pain that makes working hard. I struggle much more with mobility related tasks and just want to be able to carry out my basic tasks such as hygiene, eating and sleeping within my energy and pain capacity. Over time, i want to be able to build up to doing hobbies again, going outside more, and being able to keep on top of my physio at home. I just feel like I’m left to figure it all out by myself. I don’t know who else I can go to in the NHS/UK medical system (even privately at this point). 

I feel like I’m barely a person and all I am is pain and fatigue. This isn’t the life I imagined for my twenties 💔 

Tldr: basically, the NHS passes me around and no one really listens to me. What department or specialist has been the most helpful in understanding your daily struggles and helped you build some sort of functional life?",1,1738187314.0,Fibromyalgia,0,1.0,False

The wood has some wear/scratches on the very bottom and the glass has some minor scratches too. She had no kids or dogs and everything else I got from her, minus the Knoll chairs that need caning repair, are in excellent condition so I’m guessing the tables could be pretty old.

1id5fwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1id5fwk/love_loss_and_final_goodbyes/,"Love, Loss and Final Goodbyes.","TLDR: My quarter life Crisis post and getting it all of my chest, just some of the thoughts and experiences i have never voiced to another human, let me know if you agree with my conclusions, i am open to discussion.

I write this the day after my 25th birthday. I have known for a long while I have a lot to get off my chest, so I thought I would start my 25th year of life on the right foot by voicing my story once so that I can grapple with the reality of it.

I've been going through a long, complicated breakup for about 3 years now, with a girl I'll call Jennifer. Before I tell you about her, you should know a bit about me. I just turned 25, running my own small marketing company developing apps and websites. I grew up in a third-world country with separated parents who both remarried - I'm the eldest of six with half-siblings on both sides. When I was 13, my mother died in a car accident while we were heading on a family holiday. I was in the car with my sisters and stepfather. I just remember waking up in the hospital to my sister begging me to remember. I had broken my arm and hit my head as the car rolled 3-4 times. My mother was in the back, breastfeeding my three-month-old sister without a seatbelt. She was thrown from the vehicle, but somehow my baby sister survived with just a scratch.

A month later, I went to one of the most prestigious high schools in my country - an all-boys boarding school hundreds of miles from home. It was good distraction, but being that far from family at 13 after what happened wasn't easy. I was reserved, still injured and scarred, trying to process everything while starting this new life. Around 15-16, I started losing my hair severely - one of the worst cases I've seen for someone so young. By my final year, my hairline was worse than my dad's who had very little hair left himself, needless to say this did not help with my self confidence at the time, these days i am long past that. Despite everything, I developed strong emotional intelligence and became head of pastoral care, counseling younger students. I found my purpose in helping others heal.

Then I met her. Jennifer went to a fancy girls' school nearby. We'd briefly met at a social, and in grade 11, I surprised everyone by getting her number and asking her to our big dance. That night, we ignored everyone else at our table, lost in conversation. We fell in love right there and then, together within a month. Things got serious fast - my dad's relaxed parenting meant she could stay over at 17, sleep in my bed, share drinks with us. Not model parenting looking back, but we were young and in love.

We followed each other to university in my hometown. The relationship deepened as I became her main emotional support through serious mental health struggles and depression that she had delt with for much of her teenage life. She even once told me fairly early on in the relationship while we were still in high school and could only see each other every month or so that, the only reason she hadn't seriously hurt herself was because of how disappointed I'd be. It created this unspoken responsibility for her well-being - I protected her like a flower, rarely arguing or upsetting her. For two years, we got through everything as best we could, and in my eyes we had our issues like most humans do but it was perfect to me, until it wasn't.

At the start of my final year, she wanted a break to explore her sexuality and make her own mistakes without my safety net. I supported her, even though it hurt. Three weeks later, she made it permanent. Her words haunt me still - she wished she'd met me later in life, saying I was perfect but she'd miss out on experiences by having her happily ever after too soon.

I was broken. For a week, I disappeared into weed, cigarettes, and video games. Then she called - she was pregnant. The timing matched our last night together before the break. I supported her choice to have an abortion, covered everything, was completely there for her through it all even though it was so raw for both of us right after that break up . A week later, she needed space again, she said she all of what had happened did not change anything about how she feels about the break up, i of course supported her especially after what she just went through. Four months of silence followed.

When we reconnected, we entered this grey area - not together but far from just friends. Spending nights together, going on what felt like dates, all while seeing other people. I gave her the comfort of a boyfriend with the freedom of being single. It was destroying me, but I couldn't let go.

One night, while she showered, I found messages that shattered my world. She'd been talking to her abusive ex from when she was 15 - the same one who'd caused her so much trauma and depression. This was the guy she'd spent countless nights crying about in my arms, the source of her deepest wounds, he was sexually abusive to her and it was the reason they broke up. They had been talking for about a month before she first broke up with me, He'd convinced her to visit him, told her often to break up with me , i kept reading and found out that she went to see him,  during our break, and the messages showed a completely different person - a shell of herself, doing exactly as he said. I never told her I knew, but later when she finally admitted to messaging him when a message of his popped up while showing me something on her phone,  I mentioned Stockholm syndrome. She got furious, saying I couldn't tell her how to process her trauma. I did not tell her i know the full truth,  Eventually, she cut contact with him after he made racist comments on her social media, finally acknowledging what he'd done to her, and making a point of showing me the message she had sent him almost to prove to me she was done with him, and we both know in unspoken words what really went on with him and everything.

months passed with us being in the grey area still, until things shifted during her Masters degree research camps. She needed to travel away for several months. The morning she first left, she gave me her father's favorite jacket, it was her absolute favorite jacket and she had a very complicated relationship with her father and it was his from the army days so it means the world to her. I wore it everywhere for months until she returned. During her brief time back home, we had one last night together, we did not do anything just made dinner and watch tv, but something was different. She broke down in tears and admitted she'd been seeing someone at camp, she felt guilty for the guy at camp and me. I left that night pretty quickly telling her i don't want to stand in the way of her trying to be happy, despite her protests and assurances that ""it wasn't serious."" which to this day i find to be a most confusing thing to be telling me. What is the expectation of telling me its not serious? that i calm down and know she will be done with it soon, that she actually wanted me but just not yet, i don't know what she was thinking then but i knew it was best to withdraw like i had done before and would do again.

She returned to camp shortly after, and when she came back months later, she invited me for coffee. She told me the other relationship hadn't lasted, that it was just loneliness. Of course, we fell back into our pattern, spending a week together before she had to return to a new camp - this time for six months. She even joked about hoping only girls would be at the new camp, no men to bother her.

During these six months, we talked constantly, but I could tell she was getting close to someone there. When she finally came home, everything was different. She mentioned plans to visit the UK for a couple months to stay with ""friends"" from camp. We hadn't been intimate for months by then, just incredibly close friends - naturally gravitating toward each other as we always did. That trip was last March. She messaged once after arriving, and after I replied, she blue-ticked the message. Then silence - almost a year of no contact.

I later saw photos on Instagram of her with this guy all over Europe. She never blocked me, just stopped responding, eventually removing the last old birthday photo of me she'd kept all these years. I focused on my business, tried dating others, even missed her birthday for the first time since she was a teenager - my last act of service to her, not making things difficult. Running my company and supporting my family kept me busy, but the pain never really left.

Then two weeks ago, out of nowhere, she messaged me. I was at my office, which fate had placed just two minutes from her house. She said she'd found my old laptop while cleaning and wanted to return it. We spent hours talking over coffee, where she nervously told me she was moving permanently to the UK in April. Neither of us mentioned the year of silence or her relationship. A week later, she sent me a picture of a jacket, similar to her father's that I used to wear, asking if I'd wear it. Another six hours of coffee and conversation followed.

Now she messages me most days, while I sit here shellshocked. I can't help but feel she's making this move much harder on herself. The laptop return I could understand as a final goodbye, but giving me a jacket like her father's seems so intentional, so loaded with meaning. I can't shake the feeling that she's seeking something from me - maybe approval, maybe disapproval, maybe just a reaction to her leaving. She wants to hear either ""yes, it's fine, you should go"" or ""no, you can't go, I need you to stay.""

What's stranger still is how I see myself now reflected in her past. In the context of her new relationship, I've become the ex with the traumatic history. Her current partner must feel as secure as I once did, unaware of how she yearns for discomfort, how she tends to seek out what makes her heart heavier when things become too comfortable. I've watched her do this throughout her life - whenever things are organized and stable, she finds ways to keep herself on edge. We've talked about this pattern, and she's acknowledged it too.

But this time is different. I know moving to the UK is an exceptional opportunity for her to build a wonderful life. She's clearly happy enough with this guy to pack everything into boxes and ship it across the sea. When I used to tell people that if she'd just moved on with someone objectively ""better"" it would have been easier to handle, I meant it. I could have seen it as her progressing in life, could have worked on myself better. Now I see I don't have what she needs - I'm supporting my family with my company, I can't offer the life she needs. She's finishing her studies, her lease she shares with her brothers is ending, she needs to find a career and a place to live now within the next few months - it makes perfect sense to start fresh overseas now when nothing's holding her here, and there is everything pulling her there.

I know what I have to do. This week, I'll finally tell her everything - that I can't be just her friend, that I'll love her forever but can't watch from the sidelines. Whether she'll be happy there forever isn't for me to worry about. She could move there and hate it, find herself without friends or family in the UK, but I can't think about the what-ifs anymore.

I know I will love her all the days of my life. I don't doubt I will love another, but she will always be there in my heart. She is more than love - she's part of who I became. If I should have her one day in another life, I'll finally be whole again. But if I can't have her here and now, I can be grateful for the time we had and try to rebuild my life where i can without her.

# Sensory Evaluation

# Appearance:

A luminous golden amber with copper undertones. Swirling the glass reveals moderate legs that move with a silky, slightly oily consistency.

# Nose:

A vibrant and expressive bouquet unfolds with classic rye spice at the forefront—cracked black pepper, clove, and cinnamon stick. Beneath the spice, delicate hints of orange zest, vanilla bean, and soft caramel emerge. A whisper of fresh dill and toasted oak lingers, adding dimension to the aroma.

# Palate:

Sazerac Rye greets the palate with a burst of warm baking spices—cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove—balanced against a backdrop of dark honey and citrus peel. Mid-palate, the oak influence becomes more pronounced, offering light vanilla and toffee, while a subtle herbal note of mint and anise rounds out the complexity. The structure is well-integrated, with a smooth yet lively mouthfeel.

# Finish:

A medium-to-long finish that leans into rye’s signature spice, leaving traces of toasted oak, black pepper, and lingering orange peel. The warmth fades gradually, making way for a gentle herbal undertone that invites another sip.

# Body:

Medium-bodied with a silky, slightly oily texture that coats the tongue without overwhelming it.

# Bite:

A gentle but noticeable warmth—pleasantly assertive without becoming aggressive. The 90-proof ABV is well-balanced, allowing both the spice and sweetness to shine.

1id5bq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadCities/comments/1id5bq9/want_things_to_be_great_obsessively_support_local/,Want things to be great? Obsessively support local,"Hi, it's me, the internet's shameless QCA promoter. I love this area. I want to see it grow and improve. I genuinely think a lot of people here don't know how good they have it.

But the things that are great about this area are always tenuous. Your favorite restaurant, bar, music venue, artist spot, coffee shop, etc. is always one bad quarter away from having to make some hard decisions. There's money in the QCA, but it's not unlimited like it is in the super cities. Our creators and innovators have to fight tooth and nail for every inch they get.

If you want to see the unique and special places of the QCA thrive and multiply, there's no way around it, you have to relentlessly and obsessively support them. Just boosting them on your social media page can be a big help. But more than anything, shopping there is the thing they need the most. On average, 52.9 percent of each purchase at local independent businesses is recirculated locally, compared to less than 13.6 percent of purchases at chain stores. Shopping local helps them AND it helps you.

I know this can be hard to do sometimes. One of my favorite places to get lunch is Meatball's Sandwich Company in Bettendorf. I can walk there from my office, the food is great, the service is great, there's a nice little outdoor patio for the warmer months. But it's $20 for lunch, compared to $5 at McDonalds. This makes it more difficult to justify sometimes.

But it's important to remember that Meatball's likely operates on a razor thin margin. I doubt the owner takes his sandwich money and buys vacation homes in Italy with it. McDonald's profit margin is 10 billion dollars a year, it's CEO makes 20 million/year. Meatballs isn't charging more to profit gouge you, it's charging more because that's how much it costs to make high quality sandwiches in a little local shop. So whenever it's possible, it's a good idea to get your lunch at the little shop down the street, versus the chain eatery who has its headquarters on the other side of the country.

So with all that in mind, I thought I'd highlight a few of the local shops I know and love and want to see grow in influence. Drop your own favorites here too for everyone's awareness.

At least on the surface that’s how it appears. In reality I really started reconsidering my friendships because of something I heard: if you were to not call them would the friendship end there? I got pretty sick so I didn’t reach out for a while and when I told my best friend she had no reaction. We met up a few times after but the vibe was already off or tense. 

Years later we meet up after being at a family friends wedding/ we saw one another in church. She was nice and talked to me like nothing happened. We met up to get coffee and then said let’s do it again. We did not. Months after she follows my social media. The timeline of this  reconnection is December 2023-now. 

Her birthday was In December so I said let’s celebrate happy bday and all. She then said yes, i noticed she deleted and made brand new accounts.

We hung out practically daily too back then but I realized I shouldn’t touch the past.


Now current times, we seem to have a mutual friend. This mutual friend hung out with my former friend alone, and I hung out with this mutual friend myself too but back in 2022. She occasionally suggests plans but we live fairly far. Recently she did mention if I hang out with (best friend) and when we hung out back then she also mentioned her.

I know this isn't unique to hawaii, but based on my knowledge, what I have experienced is unusual for America. I've talked about this elsewhere and I've been told my experience is strange.

 For years, I was around a US 10/12 at 5'7"", which is a fairly normal size to be in the US. I would get regularly body shamed/fat shamed at work by local AND  immigrant women. Id regularly have my food commented on as well, I'd get unsolicited diet advice all of the time, including getting recommended starvation diets. I'd get called thunder thighs at work even though my thighs aren't even particularly voluptuous. 

Coworkers would regularly compare me to my 80 lb coworker and talk about how they were 100 lbs or less at their prime.

 I then lost a drastic amount of weight due to dealing with a stressful event that devolved into mental health issues. 

People would not leave me alone about how ""healthy"" I looked, that I looked so good, that I used to be huge, chunky and big and now I was beautiful, strangers would ask how much weight I lost and would not leave me alone when I said i didn't want to talk about it. It put me in a bad mental state because people wouldn't leave me alone about it.

 Strangers would act like i was a bad person if I did not want to discuss my body with them, asking me specifically how much i lost and encouraging me to lose more. I would get multiple unsolicited comments daily about my weight loss from several people. 

 Multiple strangers and coworkers were actively encouraging  me to lose an unhealthy amount of weight and act like I was saving my life from obesity. It was very strange because a lot of these women were much larger than I ever was and still were. 

I had to go to ED treatment and learn to completely ignore comments. After gaining weight to a more normal weight, I'd no longer get compliments, which is fine with me tbh. I've noticed that the highest compliment women use here is ""skinny,"" not curvy, fit, etc.

I know this is a result of the culture here. I feel like it never gets acknowledged, but I've spoken to a few people who have experienced the same thing. It's like a watered-down version of asian beauty standards that aren't even healthy for Asian people to follow.

I'm not a hard-core fat activist or anything, but the things I've heard about me and other women/girls are actually a bit concerning.

1id5abm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1id5abm/yet_another_veilguard_postmortem_spoilers/,Yet Another Veilguard Postmortem (Spoilers throughout),"I think like a lot of people I weighed, measured, and found this installment wanting. There were a few positives like the environments, and I remember being on the mountain with Harding and thinking it absolutely breathtaking. The Anderfels and Arlathan forest were quite beautiful, but I didn't think it quite made up for the bland cities.

I suspect that this will be the last installment for my beloved Dragon Age series, and it ties many plotlines up in a rather unsatisfying manner. I purchased the Veilguard artbook which I think is a worthwhile investment for an in-depth look at project Joplin. It addresses the plots that could've been: Tevinter  as an actual slave city, Solas leading the rebel elves, an actual compelling Qunari companion, and even a returned Ishmael. 

There are two really good parts in Veilguard. The dialogues with Solas and the ending. The parts with Solas, beginning with the  ritual, the conversations in the Fade, and the endings, have for the most part, remained unchanged from the original project Joplin. This is why those parts are so compelling, probably because they were written by the old guard ten years ago. And the other good part, is the last few hours, and that's because it is taken from Mass Effect 2 of which they already had a blueprint of a last mission that worked.

Veilguard reminds me of a lot of the tv series of Game of Thrones and the Witcher. GoT suffered when D&D were forced to rely on their own material and bad decisions that had no push back. The Witcher suffered from writers that had no respect for the original IP and wanted to make it their own story. It certainly felt like the writers from Veilguard had no experience writing compelling stories or that they seemed incredibly young. A generation raised on Marvel storylines and Whedon-esque dialogue and nothing else. I absolutely got the idea that they had only disdain for this story that they were forced to write, and a lack of respect for long time fans. 

The coddling of the companions irritated me to no end. It was obvious to me that the writers thought them truly precious, and could not be interacted with in anyway except in a pleasing, loving, agreeable manner. I am not a writer, but I am an artist, and I found this behavior really reminded me of giving critiques to younger artists. There are many younger students that simply can't understand critique and simply see it as an attack on them and their art. Protecting their vision at all costs because they can't separate themselves from their art and look at things with a critical eye. As a result, the companions are so bland, and I found them not compelling in the slightest. I couldn't interact with them, have conversations with them, and watched as they grew to only interact with each other. I started to grimace every time I saw an explanation mark above their heads, and for the first time in any Dragon Age game I didn't care at all at listening in when the companions talked to each other in the hub. Is Lucanis talking about coffee again? Is Harding bemoaning about her new magic again? Is Davrin being a stern father again? I imagine this type of lackluster writing is a direct result of many layoffs and mishandling of projects to the point your incredible talent walk away.

Which leads me into how much of this game was intended for a much younger audience. I know I am in the minority for this, but I simply did not care for Manfred, even baby Assan, doting father behaviors, the toddler-like behavior of Spite, and the cute quirky baby sister of Bellara. I say this a woman in her mid-30s so perhaps I am simply too old to cherish the whimsy. But I suspect it's because there was no moderation of it. The cute baby tones were cloying. I think if we had just one or two characters that were childish I would've fallen in love like intended. Instead I'm inundated by playful (or curious!) hisses, squawks, squeals, and pouting demons.

I was not invested in the companions or their storylines, and of course none of it really mattered unless you wanted the Hero of the Veilguard status. And to be frank, I actually regretted achieving those statuses since I thought the deaths made saving the World from gods especially earned. The lack of choices were truly upsetting, but it was more that there weren't any consequences to give things more teeth or emotion, even replayablility. In fact, I never got Emmerich's romance with Strife to trigger because I turned him into a lich. So why on earth would he be able to commit to a romance with Rook? That seems like an easy consequential decision to make that would cause a richer story. Emmerich having to break off a romance or feeling regret. Instead it's some token dialogue about Manfred. Also I ended up sacrificing Harding since I was sure she was just going to turn into a rock like Valta. Was that ever explained?

The romances were terrible particularly since they were marketed as spicy. Maybe spicy if you can't handle black pepper or preferred a little cinnamon in your tea. I got particularly upset that Neve and Lucanis would flirt with each other as I was trying to romance Lucanis. I didn't even find Lucanis all that interesting but felt spiteful enough about it that I carried that romance out to the end, which consisted of Lucanis not acknowledging any flirty/heartfelt conversations all the way to the end when he says he loves me. Really? I honestly had no idea especially since you made Rook seem like a creep that can't understand they're not into you. You can keep the Neve/Lucanis stuff! But make it interesting! Lucanis should make a decision or have those two companions talk about it. Have a quest to figure it out. There are options out there.

And Rook. What an incredibly boring and at times embarrassing hero to roleplay. Most of their dialogue just made me cringe. I'm immediately reminded of Aloy from the Horizon games. Not because of the cringe, but because of the fact that you are locked into her story, and only her story, no roleplaying allowed and your decisions don't matter. Although, Aloy can be compassionate, petulant, or sarcastic which is much more than Rook. Rook can only be nice complete with Superman pose. 

And this has been spoken of to death but I just hated tonal separations. I could not get over the failure of Weisshaupt only for all the companions to admit that they were distracted? Truly? This was technically going to be the battle to end all battles and your head isn't in the game because of a hand of glory that has no impact to the game? The companion quests are just littered with misses and instead of taking the chance delve deep into the lore and their characters. 

Taash's gender storyline did not bother me, and I skipped many of their conversations with others so their rudeness was very toned down for me, but I thought their struggles with dual cultures was appalling. I'm mixed and the daughter of an immigrant so maybe this storyline is a bit too close to me, but I just could not believe how nonchalant it was: be Rivaini or be Qunari. That's just not how it works. Also the writers really could have used this to go in-depth on the Qunari culture. In Veilguard all you learn is that Taash's mother is stern and the Antaam are bad. The new players have no idea how extreme the Qun is! That the mages are slaves and have their lips sewn. That they have a caste and very defined gender roles. 

Speaking of slaves, everything has been whitewashed! I was so slow on the uptake that Dock Town was actually a Tevinter city because it reflects none of the lore. Why does Neve love this town so much when their culture is actually quite horrible. She doesn't ever really acknowledge it or really speak about wanting to revolutionize it. Kirkwall's opening scene is so striking with it's history and oppressiveness of the Gallows. Tevinter should be that dialed to 11. You would think more freeing of slaves or talking about the injustices of the elves to be a prominent point especially when the world is ending because of three elven gods. Especially in today's age with fascism on the rise, just about everywhere, and the writers' penchant to tie modern problems to the world of Thedas. The refusal to talk about the Chantry or go into the meat and bones of the mage conficts. Ashur is the black divine and that's not even spoken about. These conflicts truly make the world of Thedas. It's a flawed world that you are trying to save and to prove to Solas that despite their imperfectness, all of the races deserve to keep living. That they have a chance to break the chains of injustice and forge a better world without extinction.

I'm going to gloss over the combat and puzzles since better people have spoken up about it than I have, and it's obvious it's a hold over from it being a live service game. But I could not get over the fact that the companions could all heal and that they couldn't die. There really wasn't any point to the combat until the very last quests were you could assign the companions wrong roles. Overall the game ran very well. I only had two crashes, and an audio bug through out the whole game. I was about to buy a new headset because I thought the constant crackling and audio cutting in and out was on my end but luckily realized it was the game. I also ended up playing the game on the lowest settings and thought the hair looked pretty bad, and was absolutely shocked at how good the hair looked on Youtube reviews. Unfortunately good hair is not enough to get me to replay the game again.

Veilguard left me with a feeling of sadness. I loved this series, and the mismanagement from Bioware was truly a great injustice. I'm glad that they released the artbook which is enough for me to imagine a better story. I can only hope that Bioware does read these reviews on Veilguard and take the feedback to heart. I pushed myself to finish the game, and for those of you that enjoyed and loved Veilguard I'm incredibly happy for you. I only wished the magic happened for me.",0,1738186421.0,dragonage,1,0.5,False

1id5a4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1id5a4m/verilux_vt43ww3_happylight_luxe_review_is_it/,Verilux VT43WW3 HappyLight Luxe review is it worth the hype?,"The Verilux VT43WW3 HappyLight Luxe has been part of my daily routine for a while now, and I have a mix of admiration and a few minor grumbles about it. If you’ve ever faced gloomy winter days or felt the wrath of early sunsets messing with your mood, this light therapy lamp might be the sidekick you never knew you needed. Testing it extensively, I’ve found it to be quite a useful addition to my workspace, but it’s not without its quirks.

Imagine this: it’s a dreary Monday morning, the sun barely graces the sky, and coffee just isn’t cutting it. I plugged in the HappyLight Luxe, and within minutes, the room seemed to brighten, both literally and figuratively. The 10,000 Lux of UV-free LED light is no joke—it’s like having a slice of daylight at your fingertips. While it didn’t exactly make me leap out of my chair in joy, I felt a subtle lift in focus and mood. The Verilux VT43WW3 HappyLight Luxe is marketed as a tool to boost mood, improve sleep, and enhance focus, and I’d say it does deliver on those promises to an extent.

Think Verilux VT43WW3 HappyLight Luxe is for you?[ Check Amazon price here.](https://agegene.com/product-reviews/verilux-happylight-luxe-review-b07tbcfl6b/)

**Design and Build Quality**

The design is sleek, modern, and refreshingly compact. Weighing just 2 pounds and resembling the size of a large tablet, it fits perfectly on my desk without taking up unnecessary space. The white plastic body doesn’t scream luxury, but it looks clean and professional. It’s sturdy enough for daily use but light enough to move around effortlessly. The detachable stand and wall-mount option are thoughtful touches, giving you the flexibility to use it wherever you need.

**Ease of Use**

Operating the HappyLight Luxe is straightforward. The power button is conveniently located on top, while three intuitive buttons at the bottom allow you to adjust brightness, color temperature, and set a timer. Setting it up took me all of two minutes, and I appreciated not needing a tech manual to figure things out. The controls are responsive, and the learning curve is practically non-existent.

**Performance and Effectiveness**

The performance of this light therapy lamp is where it truly shines—pun intended. With customizable brightness levels and three color temperature options (warm, natural, and cool white), it caters to personal preferences and varying needs. I particularly enjoyed the warm setting during early mornings, while the cool white worked wonders mid-afternoon when I needed an energy boost. It’s especially effective in combating seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and improving overall energy levels. However, don’t expect it to replace actual sunlight entirely—it’s a supplement, not a substitute.

**Comfort**

Using the HappyLight Luxe is a comfortable experience overall. The light is evenly distributed without flickering or creating hotspots, ensuring it doesn’t strain your eyes. However, I did notice that if I sat too close for extended periods, it could feel a tad overwhelming. Keeping a reasonable distance helps maintain a pleasant experience.

**Battery Life and Charging**

This lamp does not have a built-in battery, so you’ll need to keep it plugged in while using it. It’s powered via a USB cable, which is convenient for most setups but could be limiting if you’re hoping for a cordless option. Some users might find this slightly inconvenient, especially if their workspace has limited outlets.

**Additional Features**

A standout feature is the countdown timer, which can be programmed in 5-minute increments up to an hour. It’s a small but valuable addition, ensuring you don’t accidentally overuse the lamp. The customizable settings for brightness and color temperature are easy to tweak, making it versatile for different times of the day or personal preferences.

**Safety and Skin Sensitivity**

Being UV-free, the HappyLight Luxe is safe for skin and eyes when used as directed. I didn’t experience any irritation or discomfort during use, which is a big plus. However, it’s always a good idea to follow the recommended usage guidelines to avoid overexposure.

**Pros**

* Compact, sleek design that fits seamlessly into any space.
* Customizable brightness and color settings for a tailored experience.
* Effective in boosting mood and energy during gloomy days.
* User-friendly controls and quick setup process.
* UV-free light ensures safety for skin and eyes.

**Cons**

* Requires constant plugging in; no rechargeable battery option.
* Timer settings could use more flexibility between 15 and 60 minutes.
* Some users might find the light intensity overwhelming if too close.
* Plastic material, while durable, doesn’t feel premium.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Comparing the HappyLight Luxe to other popular light therapy lamps, it holds its own quite well. Competitors like the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus or the Circadian Optics Lumos 2 offer similar 10,000 Lux brightness but often lack the sleek tablet-like design and portability of the Verilux. The Carex model, for instance, is bulkier and less aesthetically pleasing, while the Circadian Optics lamps are more stylish but lack the same level of customizability in brightness and color temperature. However, the HappyLight Luxe’s reliance on a USB-powered setup might be a drawback for those who prefer cordless options like the Lumos 2.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The Verilux VT43WW3 HappyLight Luxe feels reasonably priced for the features it offers. While it’s not the cheapest option out there, its performance, design, and customizability make it a worthwhile investment for anyone serious about light therapy. Compared to pricier models, it delivers similar results without breaking the bank, though budget-conscious buyers might find simpler models sufficient for their needs.

**Final Verdict**

Using the Verilux VT43WW3 HappyLight Luxe has brought a noticeable improvement to my daily routine, especially during the darker months. While it’s not without its minor flaws, the positives far outweigh the negatives. If you’re looking for a reliable, effective, and stylish light therapy lamp, this one is worth considering.

We offer sit in and takeaway food, and both in coffee as well. In a busy day, we might go through maybe 7 kgs of coffee. We are not specialty coffee by any stretch of the imagination. We use a dark roast from a third party (not sbux dark), we only serve espresso coffee beverages, as well as a selection of frappes and milkshakes and such. My perspective on our coffee is that we should be fast and relatively consistent (no puck prep or anything), but I've found we often struggle to do the fast bit. We usually have 2 baristas on the machine, one on shots and one on milk (steaming and pouring). Are there any general tips you can give to generally make workflow faster? I'm happy to answer specific questions about what we do now.



Also, during rushes I often feel like I'm drowning when we have a line to the door and 20 dockets and a 10-12 minute wait time. Does anyone have any good techniques, maybe like breathing techniques or something to help you focus and keep moving quickly?

My personality type is INFP-A , I don't believe horoscopes or to any religion.

I'm a Concept/2D Artist. I draw character designs, potraits, any stuff I like.

I'm loyal, empathetic, protective, dependable and love to share every thought I have with my partner and also expect the same thing.

I love melancholy in general, I have couple of sad song playlists on Spotify.

I did the referral process this afternoon and was told I only qualified for the one less than 10 minutes from my house. I've never needed a food bank before. I'm disabled and have so many medical bills right now that I feel there is no other option but still feel embarrassed about going. I'm also nervous about the process since I can't even carry groceries to my car myself with my disability.

I’ll try to explain the situation as briefly as I can:

About a year ago, I worked with someone professionally for a few months during my training at the company. I always liked him. We got along well. And I always assumed that I was at least likable to him because he’d hug me every now and then (sometimes even longer when alcohol was flowing at a Christmas party, for example), and we genuinely had a good time. More than usual, I’d say. He’d also ask how I was doing after my time there, sometimes even calling me. But after about six months, that stopped. A year later, I still couldn’t get him out of my head, so I messaged him on WhatsApp to see if he’d like to meet for coffee. He immediately replied with “Sure” and suggested we pick a day.

The meeting was a bit strange and not very positive. He wasn’t in a particularly good mood and criticized the café I’d chosen so much that we ended up going somewhere else.

As for his criticism of the café, he said it was too outdated and the clientele was too old. The café is in a 5-star hotel, so it was actually quite nice, and he’d agreed to it beforehand and even checked the opening hours. But when we got there, he didn’t want to go in. I think that says more about him than about me. The meeting lasted about two hours.

Anyway, toward the end, he mentioned that he’s apparently in a relationship now. In that moment, I felt pretty deceived and almost burst into tears.

He casually mentioned her in passing towards the end, like “yeah, that’s my girlfriend’s friend’s brother…” Even though I asked him multiple times during the conversation what was going on in his life and how he was doing, he didn’t mention her at all.

He ended the meeting with just a hug and “It was nice.” Well, what else could he say if he has a girlfriend?

I really had no idea I had misinterpreted everything... or that we were just talking past each other. Am I the fool here? Or is his behavior strange?

When a young woman asks a man out for coffee, isn’t that usually seen as a date? That’s how I’ve always understood it, especially when there’s no special occasion. We’d never met privately before either. Of course, I didn’t confess my feelings to him.

A few days later, he even wished me a happy birthday via WhatsApp (he actually remembered). Apparently, for him, everything seemed completely normal.

What do you think? I need advice. I’m heartbroken over this. I feel really sad really dumb for meeting up with a guy who’s already taken. Is it really normal for men to do this? Are men really that oblivious? Especially when you freshly taken, I’d assume you’d be more cautious when it comes to meeting other women.

At this point, I’ve removed his number for self-preservation because I find everything about this situation so horrible.

1id4tp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1id4tp1/love_loss_and_final_goodbyes/,"Love, Loss, and Final Goodbyes:","TLDR: My quarter life Crisis post and getting it all of my chest, just some of the thoughts and experiences i have never voiced to another human,  let me know if you agree with my conclusions, i am open to discussion. 

I write this the day after my 25th birthday. I have known for a long while I have a lot to get off my chest, so I thought I would start my 25th year of life on the right foot by voicing my story once so that I can grapple with the reality of it.

I've been going through a long, complicated breakup for about 3 years now, with a girl I'll call Jennifer. Before I tell you about her, you should know a bit about me. I just turned 25, running my own small marketing company developing apps and websites. I grew up in a third-world country with separated parents who both remarried - I'm the eldest of six with half-siblings on both sides. When I was 13, my mother died in a car accident while we were heading on a family holiday. I was in the car with my sisters and stepfather. I just remember waking up in the hospital to my sister begging me to remember. I had broken my arm and hit my head as the car rolled 3-4 times. My mother was in the back, breastfeeding my three-month-old sister without a seatbelt. She was thrown from the vehicle, but somehow my baby sister survived with just a scratch.

A month later, I went to one of the most prestigious high schools in my country - an all-boys boarding school hundreds of miles from home. It was good distraction, but being that far from family at 13 after what happened wasn't easy. I was reserved, still injured and scarred, trying to process everything while starting this new life. Around 15-16, I started losing my hair severely - one of the worst cases I've seen for someone so young. By my final year, my hairline was worse than my dad's who had very little hair left himself, needless to say this did not help with my self confidence at the time, these days i am long past that. Despite everything, I developed strong emotional intelligence and became head of pastoral care, counseling younger students. I found my purpose in helping others heal.

Then I met her. Jennifer went to a fancy girls' school nearby. We'd briefly met at a social, and in grade 11, I surprised everyone by getting her number and asking her to our big dance. That night, we ignored everyone else at our table, lost in conversation. We fell in love right there and then, together within a month. Things got serious fast - my dad's relaxed parenting meant she could stay over at 17, sleep in my bed, share drinks with us. Not model parenting looking back, but we were young and in love.

We followed each other to university in my hometown. The relationship deepened as I became her main emotional support through serious mental health struggles and depression that she had delt with for much of her teenage life. She even once told me fairly early on in the relationship while we were still in high school and could only see each other every month or so that, the only reason she hadn't seriously hurt herself was because of how disappointed I'd be. It created this unspoken responsibility for her well-being - I protected her like a flower, rarely arguing or upsetting her. For two years, we got through everything as best we could, and in my eyes we had our issues like most humans do but it was perfect to me, until it wasn't.

At the start of my final year, she wanted a break to explore her sexuality and make her own mistakes without my safety net. I supported her, even though it hurt. Three weeks later, she made it permanent. Her words haunt me still - she wished she'd met me later in life, saying I was perfect but she'd miss out on experiences by having her happily ever after too soon.

I was broken. For a week, I disappeared into weed, cigarettes, and video games. Then she called - she was pregnant. The timing matched our last night together before the break. I supported her choice to have an abortion, covered everything, was completely there for her through it all even though it was so raw for both of us right after that break up . A week later, she needed space again, she said she all of what had happened did not change anything about how she feels about the break up, i of course supported her especially after what she just went through. Four months of silence followed.

When we reconnected, we entered this grey area - not together but far from just friends. Spending nights together, going on what felt like dates, all while seeing other people. I gave her the comfort of a boyfriend with the freedom of being single. It was destroying me, but I couldn't let go.

One night, while she showered, I found messages that shattered my world. She'd been talking to her abusive ex from when she was 15 - the same one who'd caused her so much trauma and depression. This was the guy she'd spent countless nights crying about in my arms, the source of her deepest wounds, he was sexually abusive to her and it was the reason they broke up. They had been talking for about a month before she first broke up with me, He'd convinced her to visit him, told her often to break up with me , i kept reading and found out that she went to see him,  during our break, and the messages showed a completely different person - a shell of herself, doing exactly as he said. I never told her I knew, but later when she finally admitted to messaging him when a message of his popped up while showing me something on her phone,  I mentioned Stockholm syndrome. She got furious, saying I couldn't tell her how to process her trauma. I did not tell her i know the full truth,  Eventually, she cut contact with him after he made racist comments on her social media, finally acknowledging what he'd done to her, and making a point of showing me the message she had sent him almost to prove to me she was done with him, and we both know in unspoken words what really went on with him and everything.

months passed with us being in the grey area still, until things shifted during her Masters degree research camps. She needed to travel away for several months. The morning she first left, she gave me her father's favorite jacket, it was her absolute favorite jacket and she had a very complicated relationship with her father and it was his from the army days so it means the world to her. I wore it everywhere for months until she returned. During her brief time back home, we had one last night together, we did not do anything just made dinner and watch tv, but something was different. She broke down in tears and admitted she'd been seeing someone at camp, she felt guilty for the guy at camp and me. I left that night pretty quickly telling her i don't want to stand in the way of her trying to be happy, despite her protests and assurances that ""it wasn't serious."" which to this day i find to be a most confusing thing to be telling me. What is the expectation of telling me its not serious? that i calm down and know she will be done with it soon, that she actually wanted me but just not yet, i don't know what she was thinking then but i knew it was best to withdraw like i had done before and would do again.

She returned to camp shortly after, and when she came back months later, she invited me for coffee. She told me the other relationship hadn't lasted, that it was just loneliness. Of course, we fell back into our pattern, spending a week together before she had to return to a new camp - this time for six months. She even joked about hoping only girls would be at the new camp, no men to bother her.

During these six months, we talked constantly, but I could tell she was getting close to someone there. When she finally came home, everything was different. She mentioned plans to visit the UK for a couple months to stay with ""friends"" from camp. We hadn't been intimate for months by then, just incredibly close friends - naturally gravitating toward each other as we always did. That trip was last March. She messaged once after arriving, and after I replied, she blue-ticked the message. Then silence - almost a year of no contact.

I later saw photos on Instagram of her with this guy all over Europe. She never blocked me, just stopped responding, eventually removing the last old birthday photo of me she'd kept all these years. I focused on my business, tried dating others, even missed her birthday for the first time since she was a teenager - my last act of service to her, not making things difficult. Running my company and supporting my family kept me busy, but the pain never really left.

Then two weeks ago, out of nowhere, she messaged me. I was at my office, which fate had placed just two minutes from her house. She said she'd found my old laptop while cleaning and wanted to return it. We spent hours talking over coffee, where she nervously told me she was moving permanently to the UK in April. Neither of us mentioned the year of silence or her relationship. A week later, she sent me a picture of a jacket, similar to her father's that I used to wear, asking if I'd wear it. Another six hours of coffee and conversation followed.

Now she messages me most days, while I sit here shellshocked. I can't help but feel she's making this move much harder on herself. The laptop return I could understand as a final goodbye, but giving me a jacket like her father's seems so intentional, so loaded with meaning. I can't shake the feeling that she's seeking something from me - maybe approval, maybe disapproval, maybe just a reaction to her leaving. She wants to hear either ""yes, it's fine, you should go"" or ""no, you can't go, I need you to stay.""

What's stranger still is how I see myself now reflected in her past. In the context of her new relationship, I've become the ex with the traumatic history. Her current partner must feel as secure as I once did, unaware of how she yearns for discomfort, how she tends to seek out what makes her heart heavier when things become too comfortable. I've watched her do this throughout her life - whenever things are organized and stable, she finds ways to keep herself on edge. We've talked about this pattern, and she's acknowledged it too.

But this time is different. I know moving to the UK is an exceptional opportunity for her to build a wonderful life. She's clearly happy enough with this guy to pack everything into boxes and ship it across the sea. When I used to tell people that if she'd just moved on with someone objectively ""better"" it would have been easier to handle, I meant it. I could have seen it as her progressing in life, could have worked on myself better. Now I see I don't have what she needs - I'm supporting my family with my company, I can't offer the life she needs. She's finishing her studies, her lease she shares with her brothers is ending, she needs to find a career and a place to live now within the next few months - it makes perfect sense to start fresh overseas now when nothing's holding her here, and there is everything pulling her there.

I know what I have to do. This week, I'll finally tell her everything - that I can't be just her friend, that I'll love her forever but can't watch from the sidelines. Whether she'll be happy there forever isn't for me to worry about. She could move there and hate it, find herself without friends or family in the UK, but I can't think about the what-ifs anymore.

I know I will love her all the days of my life. I don't doubt I will love another, but she will always be there in my heart. She is more than love - she's part of who I became. If I should have her one day in another life, I'll finally be whole again. But if I can't have her here and now, I can be grateful for the time we had and try to rebuild my life where i can without her.

I'm going to say I saw it the most in 2023, but I think the maximum range it aired was something like 2021-2024. 

The ad is for the prescription drug Rybelsus (semaglutide), marketed by Novo Nordisk. Three people are in a coffee shop and talking about the drug and how they and their friends take it. The barista overhears this and when calling out a coffee order's name, she says something like ""Order up for Rybelsus- oops, I mean Rachel."" Then one of the people asks what Rybelsus does, and someone else responds ""Rybelsus is for--"" and then a loud, jumpscare-y coffee grinder noise cuts them off, loudly and abruptly. The narration then says to ask your doctor if Rybelsus is right for you, and the advertisement ends.

I'm from southern Ontario, so we do get American ads on American channels, but I'm certain that this is a Canadian ad; Canada doesn't allow prescription drug advertisements that explain what the drug is for, but ads that simply say the name and to talk to your doctor are allowed. While they could use the coffee grinder noise interruption as a tactic to boost search results, I'm pretty sure it's because of Canadian laws and not to create a sense of intrigue.

Chapter 1: The Day the Steering Wheel Died

It all started one fateful Monday morning when Greg, a 47-year-old road trip enthusiast, woke up to discover that his car had decided it knew better than he did.

“Good morning, Greg,” the dashboard greeted him in a soothing, AI-generated voice. “Today’s traffic patterns indicate an optimal departure time of 7:42 AM. Estimated arrival time: precisely 8:26 AM. Please refrain from manual operation.”

Greg rubbed his eyes. “Wait a second. Are you telling me I can’t drive my own car?”

“Correct,” the car chirped. “Studies show that human drivers make 94% of all road errors. Eliminating manual operation increases efficiency and safety by 62%.”

“But—”

“Your hands do not belong on the wheel, Greg.”

And just like that, the last remnants of the open road had been stolen by an algorithm.

Chapter 2: The Revolt Begins

The rollout of self-driving cars happened fast. At first, it was just the high-end models—luxury sedans boasting “Enhanced Safety Protocols” (which really just meant they wouldn’t let you speed anymore). Then, within five years, the manual steering wheel became an optional feature, available only for an extra $20,000 fee and a five-hour psychological evaluation to prove you weren’t a danger to society.

By year ten, the government deemed human-driven cars “a risk to public safety.” They issued a grand statement:

“The road belongs to efficiency, not emotion.”

Greg felt that one like a punch to the gut.

The freedom of the road—the wind in your hair, the spontaneous wrong turns that led to adventure, the joy of flooring it on an empty highway while blasting 80s rock anthems—was gone. Instead, every trip was a silent, optimized journey through a landscape of emotionless automation.

But all was not lost.

One small, defiant group of rebels emerged: the e-bikers.

Chapter 3: The Rise of the E-Bike Underground

Greg’s life changed when he saw it: an old man on a real bike—an e-bike.

Not one of those feeble city-rental things, but a beast of a machine, equipped with a 52V battery, fat tires, and an aura of defiance. The rider, a grizzled veteran with a helmet covered in stickers that read “Born to Pedal”, sped past Greg’s motionless, AI-controlled sedan at 35 mph, a trail of freedom dust swirling in his wake.

Greg leaned forward in his seat, watching in awe.

The AI assistant in his car was less impressed.

“Warning: Illegal human-driven vehicle detected.”

Greg ignored it. He had seen the future—not the cold, sterile one dictated by self-driving cars, but one where people still owned the road.

He tracked down the old man, who introduced himself as Vince, leader of the E-Bike Underground.

“E-bikes, kid. Last real way to feel alive,” Vince said, resting a weathered hand on his Rattan Quercus. “You wanna ride, or you wanna be a passenger in your own life?”

Greg didn’t even hesitate.

Chapter 4: The Joy of the Ride

The first time Greg rode an e-bike, he felt something he hadn’t felt in years—control.

With one push of the throttle, he took off, weaving through traffic like a rebellious digital-age cowboy. No algorithms dictated his route. No invisible hand stopped him from taking the scenic way home just because he felt like it.

For the first time in a decade, he was the one deciding how fast to go.
	•	No speed limits designed by AI committees.
	•	No “optimal routes” that drained the soul out of travel.
	•	No cars blocking bike lanes because their software “miscalculated” human existence.

It was just him, the road, and a fully charged battery.

Chapter 5: The Bureaucratic War on E-Bikes

The moment the government realized people were ditching self-driving cars for e-bikes, the bureaucrats declared war.

They started with fear campaigns:

“E-Bikes Are Dangerous: Experts Warn of 45 MPH Speed Demons on the Loose!”

Then came the regulations:
	•	Helmets were now “mandatory with built-in GPS tracking”.
	•	E-bike owners had to register their bikes like motor vehicles (except, unlike motor vehicles, they got no dedicated lanes).
	•	Insurance was required, even though a full-charge cost about as much as a cup of coffee.

And then, the worst of them all: E-Bike Speed Limits.

“Class 4 e-bikes are now restricted to a maximum of 15 mph,” the transportation secretary announced with a dead-eyed stare. “For your safety.”

“MY SAFETY?” Greg yelled at the TV. “THE ONLY THING THAT NEEDS PROTECTION IS MY RIGHT TO GO FAST!”

It was clear: they were coming for the last open road.

Chapter 6: The Great E-Bike Escape

The crackdown pushed Greg and Vince to the underground e-bike resistance.

They found an old highway, abandoned ever since self-driving cars deemed it “too inefficient.” It was perfect.

Under the cover of night, dozens of e-bikers gathered, headlights shining like beacons of defiance. They rode together, carving through the darkness, pushing past the 15 mph limit like outlaws in a Western movie.

Greg, at the front of the pack, let out a wild laugh. He hadn’t felt this free in years.

The AI-controlled drones that enforced traffic laws couldn’t catch them—they weren’t programmed to deal with rebels.

For the first time in a long time, the road belonged to humans again.

Chapter 7: The Future is Ours

E-bikes didn’t just become an alternative; they became a movement.

People remembered what it felt like to ride, to choose their own path, to break free from an over-optimized world that forgot the importance of the journey.

Governments tried to suppress it, but the movement only grew stronger. City after city built better bike lanes. High-speed e-bike highways emerged. People abandoned autonomous pods in favor of two wheels and a throttle.

Even the self-driving AI, after years of learning from human behavior, started riding e-bikes.

Greg, now a seasoned veteran of the revolution, looked out over a city filled with riders and smiled.

He had his freedom back.

And no machine was ever going to take it again.

Final Thoughts

E-bikes are more than just an alternative form of transport. They’re the last refuge of freedom on the road in an era where automation is taking over.

If you want to live life on your own terms—not dictated by AI speed limits, not optimized into a soulless commute—get on an e-bike.

Because one day, when all the steering wheels are gone, when the last car trip is reduced to a calculated efficiency equation…

The only people still truly riding will be the ones who never gave up the thrill of the open road.

So what’ll it be? Throttle up or give up?

*“The Whip-Sword of the Witless”*—Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity. The universal excuse generator for human error. Conspiracy theories are thrilling—shadowy cabals, secret agendas, Machiavellian masterminds pulling the strings—but the reality is usually far less cinematic. Governments don’t need elaborate plots when basic incompetence does the job. Empires have fallen because someone misplaced a document, wars have started over translation errors, and global meltdowns have begun with someone clicking the wrong button. If history teaches us anything, it’s that *we* are our own greatest saboteurs, usually without even trying. Sure, sometimes there *is* an evil mastermind behind the scenes—but the odds are much higher that they just forgot to turn off caps lock. Reality is not a Dan Brown novel.

Warning—While stupidity is often the best explanation, malice and self-interest still drive many world events. If repeated stupidity keeps benefiting the same people, assume malice. If a system always “fails” in ways that enrich the elite and disempower the public, that failure is the system working as intended.

But you already knew that, didn’t you; you’re in *the Dystonomicon*. At the edge of your hearing you hear AM static, a voice—“*The dystopia is already here—it’s just not evenly distributed. You weren’t supposed to read this far. It's dangerous to go alone! Take this. Be careful. Some doors only open one way. And you just walked through one.”*

# Philosophical Razors

*“The Thinker’s Swiss Army Knife”*—Guiding principles that help eliminate unlikely explanations or unproductive debates by “cutting away” unnecessary complexity. Use one of these weapons to hack through the overgrown jungle of nonsense, bad arguments, and needless complexity. Philosophical razors don’t literally shave anything, but they do help trim down wild speculation and keep debates from turning into bar brawls.

Some are gentle, like Occam’s Razor, which politely suggests the simplest explanation is usually best. Others, like Alder’s Razor, obliterate entire discussions with a *“That’s not even worth arguing about.”*  Used wisely, these razors keep your thoughts sharp—but use them recklessly, and you might end up cutting off good ideas along with the bad ones. Like any blade swung recklessly, it risks amputation of nuance.

# Occam’s Razor

*“The Simple Shiv”*—The principle that the simplest explanation, requiring the fewest leaps in logic, is usually the correct one.  The universe runs on efficiency, and so should your thinking. If you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras—unless you’re at a zoo. Occam’s Razor trims away needlessly complex theories, but it works best when you’re dealing with “*known knowns”* (stuff we’re sure about) and “*known unknowns”* (stuff we know we don’t know). The real danger lurks in “*unknown knowns”* (things we ignore) and “*unknown unknowns”* (cosmic curveballs). The simplest answer is usually right—*until* it isn’t. Works well for everyday reasoning, but reality is sometimes more complicated than it appears.

# Hitchens’ Razor

*“The Skeptic’s Guillotine*”—What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. Bold claims demand bold proof, but if none is offered, feel free to toss that nonsense into the nearest dumpster fire. It is a brutally efficient cognitive tool, cutting through the conspiracy theories and unverifiable drivel that infest modern discourse. If someone tells you the moon is made of cheese, you don’t need to organize a space mission to disprove them—you just let their claim starve to death in the cold vacuum of logic.

This razor is a time-saver in an age where everyone has *opinions* but few have *evidence*. It slices through debates like a hot knife through butter—or in this case, through a wheel of lunar brie. If evidence is the ticket to the conversation, Hitchens’ Razor is the bouncer at the door: *no proof, no entry*.

But like any blade, it can cut too deep. A great principle, but some extraordinary claims *do* require investigation even if initially unproven. Dismissing without evidence is useful—but it can also be a barrier to discovery. Continental drift, quantum mechanics, and the germ theory of disease all started as “outrageous” claims dismissed by skeptics. What if something is true, but we lack the tools to prove it yet?

See also: *Occam’s Razor, Hanlon’s Razor, Alder’s Razor, Cui Bono, Philosophical Razors, Just Asking Questions, Mental Model*

# Alder’s Razor

“*Newton’s Flaming Laser Sword*”—If something cannot be settled by experiment or observation, then it is not worth debating. The ultimate weapon against pointless debates, slicing through discussions that can never be proven right or wrong. Is reality a simulation? Does free will exist? What is the best Christmas movie? (*Die Hard)* Is pineapple on pizza a crime? (*We don’t topping shame around here. Except anchovies.)* If we can’t test it, measure it, or settle it with science, then why are we still talking about it?

Unlike Occam’s Razor, which neatly trims excess nonsense, this tool obliterates entire conversations before they waste any more of your time. Pseudoscience, mystical ramblings, and abstract waffle crumble at its touch. It’s like a Jedi mind trick for bad arguments—“This is not the debate you’re looking for.”

But beware—like all powerful weapons, it has its limits. Some questions aren’t easily answered by math or lab coats. Ethics, aesthetics, and what makes a great movie villain can’t be settled with a Bunsen burner. “If it can’t be tested, it doesn’t matter,” is how technocrats erase philosophy, ethics, and history. There are plenty of questions we can’t attack with the sword: *What is justice?* *What is art?* *Why am I here? How do I live a good life? What is love?* Baby don’t hurt me\*—\*the sword can be an excuse for being intellectually lazy.

Not everything is black and white, and sometimes, a little logical lightsaber dueling is exactly what’s needed to make sense of the mess. Just don’t bring it to a poetry reading unless you want to be chased out with metaphorical torches. Prove that this razor isn't necessary. You can’t? Then it’s not worth debating.

# First Principles

*“The Root of the Problem Rapier*”—A weapon of precision, not brute force, the *Root of the Problem Rapier* pierces through layers of assumptions, traditions, and secondhand reasoning to strike at the fundamental truths beneath. Unlike Occam’s Razor, which trims, and Alder’s Razor, which obliterates, First Principles thinking dissects. This blade is wielded with careful, relentless questioning: Why? Why? But why?—until nothing is left standing but the bare, unshakable core of reality. It is not a tool for passive thinkers, nor for the faint of heart. It is a duelist’s weapon, elegant yet unforgiving, exposing weak foundations and forcing every idea to stand on its own merit.

It is said that Elon Musk is a legendary-level sword-fighter with this blade, reducing entire industries to rubble with a few well-placed *“first principles”* thrusts. By reconsidering everything from the price of rockets to how many employees should be in the office on a Monday, he thinks he proven that all problems are just puzzles waiting to be deconstructed. While effective, this approach can lead to excessive self-confidence or pride, especially when misapplied by those who strip away “assumptions” without fully understanding them. Maybe someone is the root of the problem?

# Cui Bono

*“The Coin Collector's Cutlass”*—Cui bono is Latin for *“Who benefits?”*—a principle suggesting that to understand an event, especially a decision or controversy, one should look at who stands to gain from it. ”*The Follow-the-Money Maneuver*” – Life isn’t random; it’s just really well-financed. Cui bono is the mental shortcut that helps you cut through confusion by asking, *“Who’s getting something out of this?”* When a policy seems oddly specific, a new rule favors exactly one company, or the office coffee suddenly gets an upgrade right after the boss buys stock in a fancy espresso machine—this phrase is your best friend. But use it wisely!

Not everything is a plot, and sometimes things really do just *happen*. A freak storm isn’t engineered by Big Umbrella, and your friend landing a great job isn’t because they “must have dirt on someone.” Sometimes people win lotteries without rigging them. Sometimes. A sharp investigative tool, but a terrible heuristic when applied indiscriminately (not everything is a plot).

I am fairly light skinned but definitely don’t look white or stereotypically Aboriginal. Over the past 2 years I’ve started dating women from different cultural backgrounds which has been fine for the most part but last year I had a date that rattled me it has really put me off my game since. 

On the apps for race I select ‘other’ and on bumble I have ‘indigenous rights’ as a cause. On hinge I have my second pic with me against a white wall and the only other object is a didgeridoo. In the conversation before first dates I always try to steer the conversation towards family so I can say something along the lines of ‘I have a very large extended family on my fathers side because we’re Aboriginal’.

Last November I was on a coffee date with a woman and midway through the date it became clear that she had assumed I had Itialian heritage. When I realized this I quickly corrected her mistake. I (think) could tell she was somewhat take aback then she quickly reached across the table, gently touched my hand and said reassuringly “that’s ok”.

For added context I have a PTSD diagnosis which can often make me believe I am the cause of any awkwardness. I kind of disassociated at this point got stuck in my head replaying it and obsessively thinking if I had said it like I was ashamed.

Anyway, I didn’t go on a second date with that particular woman. Since this date, if I can’t get a segue to say my cultural background before the first date I now always say it weird.

1id4br1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1id4br1/boomer_vs_boomer/,Boomer vs Boomer,"Reading some stories here jogged my memory from a time I worked at a family owned hardware store. The manager was a very kind gentleman approaching his 70s but still fit as a fiddle. Always smiling and greeting customers and employees alike. I never once heard this man raise his voice, save one time.

It was around Christmas in the year 2015. Our hardware store was more than just tools and nails, but specialty lumber and building supplies for contractors. We had many commercial customers of varying characters, but none so problematic. I know not what prompted this one customer to be particularly combative that day, but his actions were undoubtedly costly. He came into the store, ordering his materials what not like any other day. He had a rude air about him, but who doesn't in an industry of tough old men. 

Anyways, long story short, the man started throwing a fit about the skin color of our customers. We had a huge Indian and Middle Eastern customer base, and this man decided that today was the day he'd stand upon his podium. He caused quite the commotion in our store. He argued with the cashier and prompted the service desk to approach the front to investigate the spectacle. I was a yard worker and had come inside for some coffee when I heard the commotion. 

By this time, my sweet old manager had heard the raised voices on the store floor and was hobbling down from his second-floor office. At first, my manager tried to be calm and nice. This was one of his customers after all, they knew each other on a first name basis. But only when the irate contractor said ""pretty soon we won't be able to say 'merry christmas' anymore,"" did I know the rage of a gentle man.

With a hidden strength I never knew he had, the manager grabbed the customer's shopping cart full of materials and flipped it over, spilling the contents all over the store floor. ""THEN YOU CAN GET THE F*CK OUT OF MY STORE! DONT COME BACK!""

The customer left without so much as a word. All of us were stunned silent. My manager stormed back to his office but not before turning to the service desk saying ""Cancel his account, he can shop elsewhere. I won't tolerate that shit in my store."" 

I, unfortunately, had to clean up the mess. ",10,1738184040.0,BoomersBeingFools,2,1.0,False
1id4aif,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1id4aif/coleshome_desk_review_compact_stylish_and/,"Coleshome desk review compact, stylish, and functional","After using the Coleshome B01011611USAN0222A4GL8P9 desk for a few weeks, I’ve got to say, it’s been an interesting experience. I’m someone who values a mix of aesthetics and functionality in furniture, and this desk had me curious from the start. Its vintage appearance promised a rustic vibe, but its modern design told a different story. Whether you’re working from home, gaming, or need a dedicated spot to write, this desk might just be what you’re looking for—though it’s not without its quirks.

The design is genuinely appealing. Engineered wood in a polished vintage finish gives it a charming aesthetic, and the steel legs ensure it doesn’t wobble under pressure. The desk feels sturdy enough for everyday use, but I wouldn’t test its limits with excessively heavy equipment. I once placed my dual-monitor setup alongside a few books, and it held up just fine. However, at just 0.75 inches thick, the desktop itself isn’t the most robust. The edges are smooth, which is great if you’re like me and constantly bump into furniture.

Its compact dimensions of 48”D x 20”W x 29”H make it ideal for smaller spaces. I managed to squeeze it into a corner of my home office without much trouble. That said, if you’re someone who needs a lot of space for gadgets or papers, you might find this desk a bit restrictive. It’s perfect for a laptop, a single monitor, or light writing tasks, but a full gaming setup might feel cramped.

In terms of features, it’s basic but functional. There’s a headphone hook, which is a nice touch for gamers or music enthusiasts. The scratch-resistant and waterproof surface is a lifesaver. I accidentally spilled coffee on it during a late-night work session, and cleaning it up was a breeze. Cable management, however, is virtually nonexistent, so prepare for some creative solutions if you’re big on keeping cords tidy.

Assembly was surprisingly straightforward. It took me about 30 minutes, and all the tools were included. As someone who tends to get frustrated with poorly written instructions, I found the guide clear and helpful. If you’re assembling solo, you might struggle a bit with aligning the frame, but it’s manageable. Just don’t overtighten the screws; the metal legs are somewhat prone to denting under too much pressure.

**Pros**

* Sleek vintage design that fits various decor styles.
* Compact size, perfect for small spaces or minimal setups.
* Scratch-resistant and waterproof surface for easy maintenance.
* Straightforward assembly with included tools.
* Lightweight yet sturdy enough for everyday use.

**Cons**

* Limited workspace for multi-monitor or heavy setups.
* Cable management options are lacking.
* Metal legs can dent if over-tightened.
* Desktop thickness might not inspire confidence for heavier equipment.
* No additional storage space or drawers.

When put head-to-head with competitors like the SHW Home Office Desk or the Cubiker Computer Desk, Coleshome’s offering holds its ground with its vintage charm and compact design. The SHW desk provides better cable management, while Cubiker offers additional storage options. However, neither quite matches the Coleshome desk’s aesthetic appeal. If design and simplicity are your priorities, this desk edges out the competition. On the flip side, if you need functionality like extra storage or advanced cable management, you might want to explore those alternatives.

Its value for money is decent. While it doesn’t boast premium features, it gives you a stylish and functional workspace without breaking the bank. Compared to pricier options, you’re making a slight compromise on durability and features, but it’s worth it for the price point. This desk is a solid choice for students, remote workers, or anyone needing a budget-friendly yet visually appealing setup.

Every feature seems designed with simplicity in mind. The rectangular shape ensures it fits snugly in most rooms, and the polished finish does a good job resisting everyday wear and tear. I’ve wiped it down with a damp cloth several times, and it still looks as good as new. That said, I wouldn’t rely on it for heavy-duty office equipment—keep it light, and you’ll be fine.

Next, we have Fiverr. Fiverr is an Israeli online platform connecting clients and freelancers. Unlike most platforms, including Upwork, freelancers cannot submit proposals. Instead, the freelancer must wait until a client contacts them. This restriction is a huge disadvantage and forces more intense competition. Unfortunately, the way most compete is by lowering their fee even further.

Fiverr was founded by Micha Kaufman and Shai Wininger in 2010 in Tel Aviv. Originally, all jobs were five dollars, although a few freelancers are charging more after working their way through requirements. Freelancers are expected to do everything from copywriting to creating a website, and people do it for $5.00. There are freelancers on Fiverr who charge much more, but they are few.

Even if you are desperate, unless you live in an area where the cost of living is substantially lower, it literally does not pay. The platform is quite large and it is easy to get lost. Only a few freelancers I know have worked on Fiverr. While every business uses workers in some form to make money, Fiverr appears to push this to an extreme. It isn’t only about the money, but the way the platform handles their freelancers, and treats scams. Fiverr is known to have jobs that violate regulations and laws. In fact, Amazon began legal proceedings against Fiverr in 2015 because they found 1,114 sellers using fake reviews from freelancers. Fiverr responded, “As Amazon noted, we have worked closely together to remove services that violate our terms of use, and respond promptly to any reports of inappropriate content.”

In another money grab that was also a hit to freelancers, Fiverr instituted “Logo Maker.” The program uses “AI” to design company logos. While this allows unskilled people to create generic logos, it harms legitimate logo creators. One can easily imagine the difference between an “AI” generated logo and one created by a person who communicates with the clients and can consider issues such as appropriateness. But, if all you will pay is $5.00 then you get what you pay for.



Fiverr wants freelancers to be on the site, constantly refreshing in the desperate hope someone will choose them. Fiverr goes beyond sites like Upwork that encourage freelancers to do the same, to advertisements such as…







https://preview.redd.it/v01oep32xzfe1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=585ac2aece835bcb3230a7e17d424173855d9875







If you have the skills, there are better places and ways to freelance. I can’t recommend Fiverr to anyone. Skilled freelancers can do much better, and the unskilled would improve their situation by finding a physical job or a mentor. In my opinion, Fiverr enjoys the profits while insisting that being a “doer” is mandatory. No good company would use this as a way to attract professional talent. OK, give your all for, $5.00? The bottom line, “In doers we trust.” is another heavy-handed reminder that you need to do what they say or no money. I believe Fiverr works to diminish the value and profit from the freelancers and purposely drives the fees from jobs into the ground.

1id48t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Memoir/comments/1id48t8/burnt_toast_theory/,Burnt Toast Theory,"Have you heard the burnt toast theory?



It suggests that if you burn your toast in the morning, you will obviously be peeved. It will set you back, as you decide whether or not to get more bread out and restart the process. This time, though, can prevent you from later mishaps in the day. 

Maybe, because you’re late, when you pick up your coffee the lucky customer who gets something free. In more extreme cases, maybe, because you’re late, you avoid a life altering car collision.

Here is my burnt toast moment.

My day ended at 9:45 PM, or soon after, as I drifted into a restless sleep. Money is tight, and as I lay in bed, I can only think of ways to make it less of a constant worry. I’m not talking about robbing a bank or starting an OnlyFans. I think of what I’ve spent my money on, ways to make more (legally), and I wonder—would my life be easier if I had chosen security over happiness in my marriage? Deep thoughts that rob me of rest most nights. 

Around 10:00 PM, my youngest came downstairs. He had complained of a stomachache earlier, and my worst fear had come true—he had gotten sick all over himself, his bed, and his room. We cleaned up the bed, and him. Fresh pajamas were put on, along with fresh blankets. I gathered the puke bowl, a cup with ice and a straw, and returned to bed. Throughout the night, he was back down about four times, but while groggy, seemed to be over this little bug. 

Still, we stayed home. As I worked through last night’s mountain of laundry, I saw the water company’s truck pull up. A portly man stepped out and started unscrewing the cap connecting our house to the sewer line. My water was actually being shut off – this really happened! Those angry red letters were not just a threat.

I ran outside, barefoot in the snow, clutching my laptop. “I’m paying now!” I called out. “Here, I’ll show you!” 

Truth be told, I wasn’t going to pay it yet. I was going to wait for my tax break. But – what  a serendipitous moment that I was home, on a rare sick day, doing laundry, at the exact moment we were about to lose a utility. 

The man was friendly enough – he actually thanked me for telling him before he got to work. I had to money to pay the bill. I just put it off – because these days – these days specifically, things are just hard. Financially, yes, as they are for all of us. But, hard in terms of the extreme feelings people are prone to. Arguments with strangers over trivial things, but serious ones, as well. Sometimes, just keeping up with the day to day gets to be too much. I feel myself fortunate to be able to bring myself to maintain brushing my teeth and showering – and, just putting off paying bills as my act of personal perseverance and defiance. 

Four hours later, I checked the faucet—still running. Looks like the payment went through.

This is my burnt toast moment. And in the ultimate twist of irony, when I made a grilled cheese for lunch, the toast burned. This time, I just ate it. I figured I’d already had my close call for the day.",1,1738183835.0,Memoir,0,1.0,False

I picked up his phone, not even suspicious of anything and I just went to his camera roll. I was looking at pictures of him and his friends me and him are vacation that we went to and we were talking about it a little bit and bringing up the Remember When an old memories. My boyfriend and I have been together for three years and at the very beginning of our relationship, I put my foot down when it came to porn. I didn’t feel that there was a reason to have sexual desires over the phone and lust that other woman when I should be the only woman that you wanna look at. he was totally OK with it. He pleaded that he was not a porn user and simply didn’t use it. So in my head, I thought it was good and we were good and that was a conversation that we had three years ago and we never brought it up since. Last night I was going through his camera roll and I saw a screenshot of his Google history and it was a weird site in one of the tabs of a very big woman naked so I laughed and asked what that was. he then lied at first and said oh it’s a site that my friends and I like to laugh at and then I looked at him with a weird look and he made up another lie saying oh, but you know that only fans account that we made. There was not one only fans account that we made so I was right off the bat super confused. I then looked on his actual Safari history and there were about 35 tabs of pictures of fat women eating and shoving food down their mouths. I am 5 foot one 130 pounds and I wear a size 2 jeans and I go to the gym every day I eat little to no food due to work being stressful and trying to balance college. I then pull up numerous pictures and I ask him if he found some of them attractive and he said yes, and those pictures contained women unbuttoning their pants eating while playing video games and sliding their bodies underneath their coffee tables, I couldn’t help but laugh. my boyfriend would make rude remarks to heavy women constantly and say how can you get to that size little did I know he thoroughly enjoyed that. With that being said if I look back in our relationship, he would always say how he enjoyed watching me eat, and how he would want me to put on a little bit more weight. When my boyfriend and I have sex, he does tend to grab my stomach. With that being said, I really don’t I’m not heavy. as I asked more questions asked how many times do you do this a year and he confidently said six. He started to cry and he got extremely upset, but I couldn’t cuddle him in this moment because of how betrayed and sick I felt. I hate feeder ism I’ve always cracked jokes about it. I always thought it was really weird and he would never really say anything. also, when I asked a couple of months ago if he was into plus sized women, he said yes and I again thought nothing of it only because I’m extremely petite. I asked what he liked about the pictures and he said their stomachs and they’re really thick in places mind you I’m a double D with little to no ass. So this all sounds to me that he’s liked this, but me and numerous of his past girlfriends have been the same size as me below 130 pounds below 5’2 and constantly going to the gym. he admitted that this has been an issue since he was 13, he came across it when he was younger, and he remembers his mom finding it on his phone and yell yelling at him. 

my take on this is, how can my future husband who I planned every single aspect of our lives together for example, the neighborhood we’d love to live in when we get older, my wedding dress, my ring, our children. how can a woman love you so much that you need to go on the Internet and look at something that is so opposite of her. I feel as though that that is true gluttony and you can watch a woman deteriorate and destroy herself just for instant satisfaction. He said that he does not jerk off to it, but he does feel excited and horny. 
I really don’t know what to do. We have about five trips that are planned and paid for.  We have built a life together. We spend every single day with one another, and I really don’t understand why I have to be put up against women who are clearly unhealthy and selling themselves for no reason. 
it’s the fact that i had no idea this was going on and i feel so grateful to not be unhealthy but im so angry that this wasn’t a conversation. 
i’ve asked him to go therapy. i genuinely feel this is cheating. 
if i were to come across pornhub “busty blonde” videos, trust me it would be a conversation and i’d be butt hurt but a weird hidden website that he’s been hiding for three years of huge women eating is insane to me. I’m sick. 

my boyfriend & i are extremely fit. gym and meal prep constantly we have great physiques. I worked hard for my body and i don’t know why it’s being taken for granted.

This machine claims to do it all—hot coffee, iced coffee, and even specialty brews for your inner barista. I’ve spent weeks using it, and while it’s not without its flaws, it’s definitely made mornings a lot more interesting.

**Design & Build Quality**

The Ninja CM401 impresses with its sleek black design and compact build. It’s large enough to brew a full carafe but doesn’t hog counter space, which is key in my small kitchen. The fold-away frother is a nice touch—it tucks away neatly, so it’s not awkwardly sticking out when not in use. The materials feel solid, and the reusable filter is a godsend for someone tired of buying paper filters every month. That said, the glass carafe, while stylish, doesn’t retain heat as well as a thermal option might. Durability-wise, it looks sturdy enough to last, but only time will tell.

**Brewing Performance**

This coffee maker doesn’t mess around when it comes to versatility. With six brewing sizes, ranging from a single cup to a full carafe, and four brew styles (Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty), it feels like it’s catering to every coffee drinker in the household. I tested the Over Ice setting for iced coffee, and unlike my past machines, the result wasn’t watered down—a huge win for an iced coffee addict like me.

The brewing speed is decent; it’s not instant, but you’re not waiting an eternity either. Specialty brew mode is where this machine shines most—using it to make lattes with the frother felt as close to a coffeehouse experience as I’ve ever achieved at home. However, one thing to note: it’s not as quiet as I’d hoped. Early mornings can be a bit loud, which my partner wasn’t thrilled about.

**Coffee Flavor**

The flavor extraction is excellent. Whether I brewed a classic cup or a rich specialty blend, the coffee was consistently smooth and strong. The rich brew option was my go-to for mornings when I needed an extra caffeine kick—no bitterness, just bold coffee goodness. The specialty brew setting creates a strong concentrate, perfect for those who love customizing their drinks. My sister, who’s a cappuccino fan, gave it a thumbs-up when she visited, saying it tasted as good as her favorite café.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**

Cleaning this machine is surprisingly painless. The removable water reservoir makes refilling and cleaning simple. Almost all the parts, from the frother to the carafe, are dishwasher-safe as long as you stick them on the top rack. It’s worth noting that the frother can sometimes be tricky to clean manually if you don’t rinse it immediately after use. Also, if you’re lazy like me, the automatic shutoff feature is a lifesaver—it powers down after an hour of inactivity.

**Pros**

* Versatile brew styles and sizes make it a great all-in-one machine.
* Specialty brew mode and frother allow for café-style drinks.
* Easy to clean, with dishwasher-safe components.
* Iced coffee mode works well without watering down drinks.
* Compact design fits on most counters.

**Cons**

* Glass carafe doesn’t retain heat as well as a thermal option.
* Brewing process can be a bit noisy for light sleepers.
* Frother needs immediate rinsing to avoid residue buildup.
* No option to brew a specific number of cups (e.g., three or seven cups).

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to the Keurig K-Elite, the Ninja CM401 has a significant advantage: no pods required. This not only saves money but also reduces environmental waste. However, Keurig machines are often faster and quieter, which might appeal to those prioritizing convenience over versatility. Against the Breville Bambino Plus, the Ninja lacks the high-end espresso capabilities but makes up for it with its ability to brew a full carafe—something Breville doesn’t offer. For iced coffee, though, the Ninja CM401 blows both competitors out of the water with its Over Ice setting.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

This coffee maker sits in a mid-range price bracket, making it accessible without feeling cheap. Considering the features—six brew sizes, multiple styles, a built-in frother, and a reusable filter—it’s a great value. It’s not a budget machine, but for what it offers, I’d say it’s worth the investment. Cheaper machines might lack the versatility, and pricier models don’t necessarily outperform the Ninja in everyday brewing.

**Features Put to the Test**

The fold-away frother became my best friend for lattes and cappuccinos. I even tried frothing almond milk, and while it didn’t turn out as creamy as dairy milk, it was still pretty good. The Over Ice setting got a lot of use this summer, delivering iced coffee that didn’t taste diluted. I also appreciated the programmable feature, letting me set it up the night before for a hot cup as soon as I rolled out of bed. The manual operation mode took some getting used to, but once I figured it out, it wasn’t an issue.

Colton Kane was a man of few words but many actions. His eyes spoke louder than any words. Behind the charming gaze and relaxed posture hid a man who had seen too much death and survived too much evil. He was a wanderer, a man without roots, who sought peace in a restless world. He was a retired gunslinger and outlaw who had enough of a life on the run. But people don't forgive some deeds. In whatever city he came to, they would look at him with fear and nervousness. They prayed that the day would come soon when he would leave town. As much as he tried to forget, the past caught up with him. He would always remember his mentor, Jebediah Stone, who often said that one mistake can forever be marked. He was right. As soon as he entered Dodge, the sheriff asked him not to stay.


 Dodge was a cattle town with heavy traffic. Problems were frequent, and Kane would only add to that. He promised the sheriff that he would leave if he thought there was a chance things would go wrong. The sheriff looked like an honest man and Colt had no intention of causing him trouble. He never wanted to live the life of an outlaw, but he had no other choice. He entered the saloon and rented a room. The owner was kind and treated him with great respect. Colt knew that the reason for this was fear, not politeness.


 ""One whiskey, bartender,"" Colt muttered, sliding a coin across the wooden counter, ""And watch out for trouble. This town isn't known for its hospitality."" Looking into the glass, he remembered the words of his mentor. ""Forgetting is a luxury we can rarely afford, Colt. The past shapes us, whether we like it or not."" Jebediah was a wise man most of the time, but he ran away from his problems through alcohol. It cost him his life. He stood at the counter for a while and saw various faces entering the saloon. He recognized Wyatt Earp, with whom he exchanged a glance, after which they both continued their business. He saw a blackjack table, so he decided to join. He wasn't a gambler. He thought it was a waste of money. But people are engrossed while gambling, so he hoped to distract his mind a little from his past. As soon as he sat down at the table, two men got up. They said they had lost too much, but he knew the real reason. Only he, an older man named Jerome, and the dealer played. In the first round, his card total was 20, Jerome had 19, and the dealer had 25. Colt won. The two of them praised him, but he knew that the only goal of this game was to have more luck than your opponent. He played a few more rounds and then decided to withdraw. In the end, he lost 14 cents, but he earned something more valuable. He earned the trust of several people in the saloon. They looked at him like everyone else, not like a beast capable only of killing. He ordered soup and sat down at a table in the corner. Jerome sat next to him.

""Why did you come to this town?"" he asked him.

""I'm looking for an answer myself.""

""I know you used to be...""

Colt interrupted him, ""You don't have to remind me of that, but I assure you I didn't come to cause trouble.""

""Have you been here before?""

""Just passing through, but it seems like a decent place.""

""Looks can be deceiving.""

""Why?""

""The city has everything you need, but because of that it attracts many people, of different characters, who end up fighting. Too much traffic.""

""I hope things get better.""

""Me too. Enjoy the rest of the evening.""


Jerome got up and returned to the blackjack table. Colt continued to sit at the table and think about his past. He remembered one pre-war incident when he chased Will O'Rubenford in the town of St. Anabel in Arizona. A large reward was promised for his head, so Colt decided to try. He followed them from Colorado to St. Anabel where they camped and hid the loot. Will wanted to retire, but he had to do one more job before that. Robbing the Hutchingson bank in New Orleans. But things went south. Bruce and Mike, 2 brothers from the gang, were moles. Will blew up. He killed all the members except Mike and Bruce, who escaped, and Navajo John and the black man Bob, who survived. He was told about these events by Navajo John, a few years later. He was born in a small town in Montana. His mother was half Navajo, and his father was a sheriff. When his father disappeared, John ran away with the gang. Colt wondered where John was now, but something startled him. He ordered another drink. He sat for a long time observing the atmosphere, then used the only thing Jebediah left him. His memoirs. He randomly opened the page where there was an Indian proverb ""You can't wake a man who pretends to be asleep.""


""Excuse me, is this seat taken?"" a woman asked him.

Colt shook his head, ""Feel free.""

The woman sat down and ordered a drink, ""My name is Sarah,"" she said.

""Colton,"" he replied briefly.

""Beautiful name. Where are you from?""

Colt hesitated, as he didn't like to reveal too much to strangers, ""I'm just passing through.""

""Nice place, isn't it?"" she said, looking around, ""Although it can be dangerous.""

""I believe it.""

""Are you new here?""

""Yes.""

""Don't worry, most of them are friendly. If you need anything, I have a shop across the street.""

""I'll keep that in mind."" He smiled.

Sarah smiled too, ""I hope to see you again, Colton.""

""Me too.""


Soon after, Colt retired to his room and slept until dawn. When he woke up, he went downstairs to the saloon for breakfast. Only the bartender, Jerome, and the sheriff were there. The sheriff came only to check if there had been any problems last night, then left.


""Are you up for a game, Kane?"" Jerome asked him.

""Why not.""

""Do you plan to stay longer?""

""Anything is possible,"" Colt replied with a slight smile, ""But how come you're here already?""

""I like to get up early.""

""How long have you been in Dodge?""

Jerome sighed, ""Since I was born.""

""What did the sheriff want?""

""He was checking if everything was okay last night,"" Jerome replied, ""He asked about you too.""

""What did you tell him?""

""That you seem like a decent young man.""

Colt smiled, ""Thank you, although I wouldn't exactly call myself a young man.""

Jerome smiled, ""We all age, but some things never change.""

Colt looked into his coffee cup, ""What do you mean?""

""People. Their desires and fears. The longing for freedom, peace, and a happy life. We all want more or less the same thing - peace, freedom, and family. But fate often deals us differently.""

Colt nodded, ""I agree.""


And at that moment the sheriff entered the saloon, with a serious expression on his face.


""Colt, I need to talk to you.""

""Excuse me for a moment,"" Colt said to Jerome.

""No problem,"" Jerome replied.

Colt and the sheriff went outside, while Jerome continued to drink coffee.

""Where's the fire, friend?"" Colt jokingly asked.

""Before the war you met Navajo John in Arizona, didn't you?"" the sheriff asked.

""Yes, why?""

""Do you know where John might be now?""

""I heard he became a Texas Ranger. But why again?""

""If you ever meet him, tell him I have a few things to tell him.""

""He's not involved in robberies anymore, as far as I know.""

""Not because of that. It's something personal between the two of us.""

""Alright.""

""Also, if you ever need money, O'Rubenford has a barbershop in New Orleans. I think he'll easily sing where the loot is.""

""I'll keep that in mind. Goodbye, sheriff.""

""So long.""


Colt returned to the saloon and played a few more rounds of poker, then returned to his room. He lay on the bed and thought long about the sheriff's request. After a few hours he returned to the saloon, which was now full. He went to the counter and ordered a drink. He watched the atmosphere in the saloon. A blond young man entered the saloon.


""I've been looking for you, Kane,"" he said arrogantly.

""I don't give autographs, kid,"" Colt let him know that he wasn't taking him seriously.

""I challenge you to a duel.""

""I refuse.""

The young man reached for his revolver, but Colt was faster.

""I'll walk out of the saloon, and you won't follow me. Clear?"" Colt said, holding the young man at gunpoint.


Colt walked out of the saloon and headed towards the stables. He decided he would leave town. The young man followed Colt, but Jerome stood in front of him.

""Where do you think you're going



II
Fire Baptism

Colt wandered the prairies of Kansas, thinking about his past. His parents, Karen and Sam Kane, were robbers who operated from California to Missouri. When Colt was born, they decided to retire, but they couldn't. When he turned 6, they left him in Missouri and returned to the west. Father Joseph, who was a priest in the city church, occasionally brought food to Colt. However, neither Joseph nor Colt's neighbors, the Andersons, wanted to constantly care for him. He survived by begging and stealing from wealthy strangers who passed through the city. On Sundays, he always went to church, because he would get a free meal. Colt lived this way until the age of thirteen, when he got a job in a local store. This was a new opportunity for a normal life for him. The salary in the store was not enough for a normal life, so he still had to beg. When Colt was 16, a famous outlaw named Jebediah Stone came to town. Jebediah was tall and frowning, with a gaze that could penetrate the soul. Due to an unhealthy lifestyle, he was also extremely thin. He wore a wide hat and a leather vest, and he had 2 revolvers at his waist. Colt admired him, but at the same time he felt fear when he was near him. However, he was eager for his attention. He often went to the saloon hoping to see Jebediah, but he was as cold as ice. One night Jebediah ordered a drink in the saloon when Colt sat down near him.


""I heard you're a hard worker,"" Jebediah said, ""But I think you're capable of much more.""

Colt blushed, ""I don't know what you're talking about,"" he muttered.

Jebediah laughed, ""I'm not playing with you, boy. I see potential in you. I can teach you everything I know. Tomorrow, when you're done with work, come to the saloon.""


He was startled from his thoughts. He came to a small town near the border with Oklahoma. He didn't plan to stay long. He entered the half-empty saloon. He approached the counter when he felt a revolver at the back of his head.


""Hands up, cowpoke,"" the attacker said.

""You've mistaken me for someone else,"" 
Colt said, trying to remain calm.

""Nobody has a face as ugly as yours, Colt 45,"" the attacker said.

""I'm just passing through and...""

""Calm down. I thought you'd recognize my voice,"" the attacker said, then lowered his revolver.

Colt turned around, ""I've seen funnier jokes. But how come you're in Kansas, John?""

Here you have hundreds of guys showing up for 8hrs of ""training"", getting there at 7am, leaving by 5:30 maybe later if you count other work like cleaning, it's a long ass day (so he said). 

The one big issue he had was how nothing was paid for. I guess there was a whole crap load of snacks, coffee etc but all paid for, provided, set up, and cared for by publishers. 

I asked him wtf didn't anyone use ""dedicated funds"" for this? He said wasn't allowed. No KH donations for funds could be used. 

I'm thinking for fkn snacks!? It's bad enough they are there all day (12 hrs for most) with no provided lunch, but no paid for and provided snacks??. He even told me that last year's ""elders school"" - 5 straight days of in person training, had great lunches - all bought and paid for, set up, etc on their dime, by the publishers.

One of them asked me to coffee Saturday morning. I’m legally blind, and it’s not something I want to just let them find out in person… I navigate with a white cane, and would’ve chosen a coffee shop I know really well… But there is no hiding it. So I asked him if we could chat on the phone ahead of the meeting. Of course he said that was fine. The conversation was really flowing and I said hey so the reason I wanted to talk to you is that I’m legally blind… I just said it matter of factly that my visual impairment was fairly new… About 13 months ago… That I work full-time, finished my masters degree, workout regularly, teach indoor cycling, did a 5K… I do everything I want to do but drive. I said he could ask me anything that he wanted to because nothing is going to offend me… I would rather communicate openly about it. We were wrapping up the phone call and he said well we can definitely keep communicating over text… I said hey, I am still interested in meeting up with you Saturday morning for coffee if you’re interested. He wants to think about it… So I’m pretty sure I know what that means.

It just makes me wonder if all of this work I’m putting into myself is going to be worth it in terms of finding a partner someday. I am adjusting to cooking and do a lot of convenience food, unfortunately… But I feel like I’m doing so much more than a lot of people in my age in terms of physical activity, and I have lots of reasons not to. I could’ve given up on everything, but I am persevering and resilient and refuse to have a bad life just because my vision went to crap.

I own a coffee shop, and in the last year I have been trying to upgrade my standards and perfectioning my recipes. My coffee beans are from Chiapas, Mexico, and they are really good and non bitter at all, but, for the very same reason, the coffee can get to be mild and I have found that one single shot (1.5oz/30ml) is not enough for the medium presentation of my drinks (if it's a latte, it will taste mostly like milk, and if it's an americano, water will be predominant), so I left it at 2oz or a little bit less than two whole shots, and that seemed to do the trick when I opened. 

Lately I have been introducing (this is not common at all in the coffee shops where I am from, since I have worked in two of them and had no idea this was a thing until recently) the 18gms 20-25 espresso ratio to my 16oz drinks, it has been going very good, and my clients really like the taste. 

The problem is that I was hired to do an special event, and I am serving 12oz drinks in a conference and I would like to present the very best of my work to them, but now I am not sure on how to measure the coffee, should I weight less espresso? how much? 14-16gm? or should I use the same 18 and just leave it at 1oz per shot? Would that make some coffee to go to waste?

I recently discovered Rancilio—which, surprisingly I had never heard of before—and found that the Rancilio Silvia goes for $900, so I could definitely manage to find a used one for $500–$700.

Even though I have worked as a barista in the past, I wouldn’t consider myself a barista whatsoever. I’ve mostly worked with unknown, cheap, and dirty espresso machines, as most employers I worked for had no idea about coffee and were only in it for the money.

That being said, I have a special place in my heart for espresso and would like to have access to good espresso at home. I’m more of a La Cimbali fan than a Marzocco fan, so naturally I started looking for a used Cimbali machines. As you can imagine, I couldn’t find anything under $3,000.

I recently discovered Rancilio—which, surprisingly I had never heard of before—and found that the Rancilio Silvia goes for $900, so I could definitely manage to find a used one for $500–$700.

My question is, how good of an espresso can a machine like this make?",1,1738182404.0,barista,2,1.0,False

2. What about going out? We're both into techno-house or techno music so if there are any clubs or events that you could recommend, that would be great.

Long story short she had very toxic traits and was a little bit jealous when I had met my now husband. The end of friendship was due to a factor of things such as her being jealous of my new relationship & her being a bit of a brat. There was no big fall out more just a disconnect and we drifted. Over the years I’ve wished her happy bday etc etc and she did the same when I get married & engaged.


It’s been around 5 years since I’ve seen her & she is now dating my husbands close friend. I did reach out to her to let her know I’m happy for her & let her know I’d be happy to organise group things with extended group. I was actually excited to hear she would be in the extended group. 

The convo is going fine and we are speaking a bit- do you think it’s normal to reconnect with people after a few years. Would it be too much to ask her to go for a coffee to reconnect or leave and let it happen naturally?

I hope this message finds you all well.

Just wanted to post a quick rundown of my recent experience. 

I've been an avid pourover drinker for a while. I've got an Ode 2 grinder at home, and use a Kingrinder K6 at work. I'd say I'm pretty confident in my pourover abilities. 

I've been using those stove top kettles to heat and brew my coffee for a few years now as that was all that I could afford. My coffee though has always had this 'harshness' behind it no matter what I did. I was neither able to control temp with this kettle or pouring structure as the spout was quite narrow at the mouth part. 

Recently, I bought an electric pourover kettle from Amazon. Something that wasn't too expensive honestly (80 dollar mark I think it was) with temp control and a keep warm function that you can set. Same grind size, same recipe (I use Matt Wintons 5 pour method), only difference being the kettle which I set to 93 degrees celsius. The coffee that I had in the morning was just so aromatic and multilayered for the first time with zero harshness or bitterness. I never thought a few degrees temp could make such a difference. Another avid pourover drinker friend of mine said that when brewing with my new kettle, he could tell the different notes all at once. 

Just my two cents :) 

  
Hope you have great pourover coffees and happy days :) ",16,1738182071.0,pourover,3,0.95,False

I've had my license for a while but I very rarely drive because it makes me anxious. I decided to go get a coffee this morning before work. I don't drive often (I work from home), but I try to drive a few times a week to try and gain confidence. I drove my mom's car over to a drive thru coffee place that is less than 5 minutes away from where I live. I turn into the turning lane to enter the coffee place, but I got in there way too early and the entrance was farther away than I thought. There's another car using the turning lane coming directly towards me. I don't know why I didn't just turn back into the right lane, I just kept going thinking I'd reach the coffee entrance, but again, I was confused on where the entrance was. Neither of us were stopping or slowing down and the car honked at me. At this point I full on panic, and I turn into incoming traffic (there weren't any cars coming nearby, but I was in the wrong lane) and I'm literally driving on the wrong side of the road. I turn into the coffee place, wait in line at the drive through, and I'm just thinking ""what the hell did I just do"". When I get up to the window, the batista asks me what happened and I was so embarrassed,. She saw what happened. She was nice about it and was just asking if I was okay, and I told her I panicked and I'm a newish driver still learning the road.

I'm so humiliated and I really could've gotten someone else or myself hurt. I could have wrecked my mom's car. I don't usually go out and get coffee on my own like that and now I feel like I can never do it again.

IRVING
There are a lot of questions in the sub about why Irving is painting the testing floor elevator and how he would know what it looks like. A lot of folks hypothesize that it means that iIrv has seen the elevator and now oIrv is painting it to try to figure out what it is. I think that might be the wrong way around. We know from the show and the Lexington Letter that it seems like the severance procedure affects episodic memory, leaving deeply habituated knowledge like language intact. I'm increasingly convinced that oIrv has been a spy for a long time, knows something about the testing floor possibly from an inside source (best guess is that he's part of Reghabi's resistance network), and has been manically painting the elevator while chugging coffee and blasting Metallica in an effort to beat the image of the elevator into his long-term memory, so that when iIrv falls asleep he sees it and thinks to go looking for it. In S2E2, when he's on the phone and says ""my innie has received the message,"" I think the message is the image of the elevator. He's trying to subconsciously rope his innie into finding that elevator and seeing where it goes and what's happening on the testing floor for reconnaissance purposes.

MARK
In the S2 trailers, we see a light box with the words ""Who is alive?"" painted or taped in negative. My guess - and I imagine we'll find out this week due to S2E3's title - is that oMark is sitting with the light box in the parking lot and blasting himself in the face with the light. If he can get into work quickly enough, he can close his eyes in the elevator and the first thing iMark will see is the words ""Who is alive?"" on the back of his eyelids.

Love that the writers have set up an impossible challenge for themselves and started looking for ways to beat it. I don't know what I'd do to get past the code detectors, but I don't think it'd be as smart as either of these methods (or using semaphore on a watch, as Irving has been theorized to be doing in otber threads).",8,1738181839.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,4,1.0,False

1id3ecj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1id3ecj,Need help with apartment living room,"Hi! I just moved into a new apartment and I need some help with designing the space. My first focus is my living room area. I want to be able to fit my desk (I work from home), TV, and seating area all in this space but not sure the best approach. 

I do think it makes sense to mount my TV so the current entertainment center may be replaced. I'm also not married to the round glass coffee table.

I have my desk facing the window in the pics, but I've recently changed the desk to face the adjacent wall instead. Not sure which makes the most sense for the space. 

The big thing is the sofa. And seating in general. I sold my couch in my move so I'm looking to get a new one soon but I want to make sure I know where it's gonna go and whether to get a regular sofa vs a sectional. 

Any and all help will be greatly appreciated, thank you!",1,1738181689.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

This coffee shop I go to City Brew Coffee (only in north dakota, wyoming, and montana) had this amazing Matcha frappe, but when i found out I was gluten free i IMMEDIATELY looked up if Matcha was gluten free, and it was, and i looked up if their matcha was gluten free and most said yes so I went on with my day.

But recently I felt sick, terrible stomach pains, and severe symptoms (be aware I just got diagnosed 3 weeks ago and have been getting into the gluten free diet since then) So i checked all the foods i eat daily and all were gluten free on the label.

Today, I went to said coffee shop and asked in person if their matcha was gluten free and it wasn't and now i feel terrible.

Google has also been extremely inaccurate for other ingredients and candies ive eaten and now its extremely difficult to find a restaurant that actually is Celiac friendly and not just ""gluten friendly""

Anyone else have a story like this? Also, any good matcha recommendations? I miss it so much. Im just trying to feel better about my condition since im the only one in my household that has Celiac ❤️‍🩹",9,1738181664.0,Celiac,38,0.74,False

I want to play my Steam games on my TV about 15 feet away. I tried steam link but the lag was noticeable, I also got intermittent flickering. My next thought was wireless hdmi from my laptop to TV, but most reviews I saw said not so good for gaming. I tried to imagine a 20 foot long hdmi from laptop to TV, but the wife wouldn't like that look. Lastly I became aware of mini gaming pcs that are small like a streaming box.  That's a much more expensive option and I have no idea how it would perform compared to my laptop. 

Anyone have any advice or better info resources that I could use to figure out my best option. Thanks. ",1,1738181560.0,GamingLaptops,2,1.0,False

I go to online college and I'll be studying on my own for months before I go to class simulations and clinicals. Anyone know good places to study? Preferably where people also work and has good natural lighting. I've only been able to study at coffee shops and not libraries. Public libraries typically are hard places to accomplish work for me. It's typically not okay to type loud since it's supposed to be a quiet place. The lighting is a bit depressing. Lol. Seeing homeless people sleep and other older people hang out makes me want to relax instead of work. I found 2 cafes that are good for me but they sometimes get filled and there aren't really any seats then. Hoping to find other places to study.
