My main hobbies and interests include photography, Warhammer, tattoos (if that qualifies), reptiles/amphibians (although I don’t have any yet), gaming and some exercising while listening to metal, drinking coffee, going out for walks and some cosplay. I also like to read and write when I have the time and inspiration. I also haven’t been to the cinema for a long time so that’s a thing I’d be up for doing too, or just going out and having a good time in general. Would also be interested in learning Magic The Gathering if anyone plays that. I also have a PS5 so gaming buddies would be appreciated too.

If any of this sounds interesting, definitely send me a message.",1,1729145514.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

 https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/s/rxJNF9ahl6 


I was grateful for the encouragement I received on my earlier post and decided to hang in there with the prospect and try to make things work. 

Sometimes when everything is good on paper, no major red flags, basics match and your family is happy, it's really tempting to want to make that adjustment because why not? Practical aspects like diet, lifestyle, finances matching is a huge deal these days. 

With that in mind, I made efforts to genuinely establish connect. We were in different locations, which meant long distance in the talking phase was a slight challenge. But I'd share photographs of little things during my day, small meaningful things like the flowers I saw at work, sunset views and even little recipes I was cooking. I'd share memes, songs I was listening to, jokes and funny YouTube videos. I even shared my blog posts (I write during my free time). All this was basically an effort to steer the conversation towards building a connect - in any form. I think when you share parts of your personality through messages, it's basically encouraging the other person enough to maybe open up slowly too and lower their guard. 

But unfortunately, things didn't change from his side. Conversations were still very surface level, and he would respond to my texts with a ""Oh nice"" ""Oh that's great"" or just a plain hahaha. Some of the texts were left on read. I received dry texts for months together. We did have calls twice a week, even video calls, and conversations were limited to just places to hang out, work related chats, daily routine. It got frustrating for me to be very honest, I felt like I was pouring my heart and soul into a vessel that wasn't ready to receive it, you know? But I'd also look at my parents' happy faces and swallow the dissatisfaction thinking things may change, let's keep trying. 

I was wrong. These things stayed even when we met up. Also, I found a couple of things that I hadn't discovered earlier in the calls/chats -

The guy wanted me to relocate which I was happy to do so, and change my job. My entire viewpoint on relocation is - I'd genuinely do it if the person is good, because that's going to be your life partner. But he mentioned all the matches he spoke to weren't ready to do this, and he felt women these days have turned extremely rigid. He said he was being flexible but they are too rigid (I found this very weird because if he wasn't willing to relocate, how was he flexible?)

Another aspect was his fixation on looks. Attraction means a lot to everyone, to be fair it means a lot to me as well so I understood his point of view. But the way he kept talking about most matches - they're beneath him in looks and personality and he can't stand the sight of them, made me feel uncomfortable. Apparently, I was one of the rare ones he sent a request to, because he liked me, but he had high standards otherwise. Not sure why but this made me very uncomfortable. 

An unfortunate thing happened where I fell sick when we had met up the third time, and after coffee, I was planning to leave. I was beginning to get a slight fever and let him know that I wasn't feeling well. His reaction to it was ""Oh that's too bad, maybe it's the AC here"" and a couple of minutes later he asked which other places I wanted to hang out at, next. Maybe he was being logical and cool and didn't think being sick was a huge deal, but the fact that he didn't ask if I'm feeling well enough to want to continue the meeting felt like he did not care much. I politely reminded him I was feeling unwell and came home. 

After all of this, I went home and let my family know, with a genuine reason why things would not work with him, and I wasn't ready to leave behind my circle, family and job with someone who doesn't meet my expectations emotionally. The lack of connect made me feel like the change of moving to a new place with someone very different from me was something I didn't want at all. 

He may not be a bad person but sometimes things just don't align with people no matter what you do. Parents being parents were disappointed but I also reminded them that it's okay to take time and be by yourself than with someone with whom you feel - alone. 

I dropped a closure message to the guy as a way to end things on a positive note. I take it that he was probably irritated with my decision, because he didn't reply and I left it at that.",1,1729145501.0,Arrangedmarriage,0,1.0,False

But sadly things changed drastically after marriage. She has abused my parents on multiple occasions privately to me, cursed them, abused me, told me i’m not a man, disrespected me, she slapped me once and even does weird shit like “you dare step out of the bedroom “ when she’s angry and having a heated argument with me. On many occasions when having the said fight she has asked for a divorce and said she regrets ever being with me or meeting me but then after a bit of calming down comes back to me with hugs and kisses and apologies. She has even mocked my childhood traumas and has told me the lack of intimacy between us could be because of that but in reality after so many things coming from her end and on such a high level which i couldn’t let go has caused these intimacy issues. When i tried to speak about these issues between us she would get mad at me and just say i should let go of things more and not cling onto words. 
Dear redditors, please be informed that i have left no stone unturned as a husband. I Support her family financially every month, help do the dishes, help cooking dishes, take her out every single day, even buy food from outside, coffee dates everything and she’s been very happy and satisfied as she knows i have given her the world which she never had come from a unstable financial background then why such treatment? Why does she think i deserve this? And as for my parents they haven’t even asked her for a glass of water or any personal favors. 
Generally, to everyone she comes of a very sweet, kind and sensitive person who is literally even scared of a stray cat walking on the road but turns into this demon when we are within the four walls of our bedroom or inside the car. Screaming on top of her voice, crying, shouting, abusing and cursing. 

She’s currently back in her home country and a couple of days ago we had another such heated argument where she abused my parents again because my father failed to answer her fathers call when he was calling to talk. I couldn’t take it anymore and i finally after 2 years of keeping quiet i broke it all out to my parents and they were shocked to hear all this. My parents have asked me to cancel her visa and let her stay where she is and ask for a divorce. 
Ever since then my so called wife has gotten a stench of things getting worse as my mother confronted her through text and ever since then has been apologists telling me that she’s changed, trying to call me multiple times to talk (but i never answered because i do not have the heart to anymore) but last night i spoke to her and she’s been very apologetic, crying and has promised to change her ways but i don’t feel it anymore.. i don’t feel the love for her anymore nor do i feel the affection for her… 
The worst part is that i’m feeling guilty about letting her go and i’m not able to ask her for a divorce or tell her about how i feel because i’m worried to how she’d react to it, i’m afraid she might harm herself or do something worse and i do not want to listen to her cry and tell me all those sweet things as i know my hearts a sucker for such things and i’d fall right into it again. I do know what the right thing is but i just dont know how to do it..even though i have fought countless battles as a kid and with life in general but in this time when i need it the most i’m failing to do so..

TLDR: I’m not able to divorce my abusive and ungrateful wife, i’m feeling guilty and fear thinking what might happen to her if i do so or how she might react to it but i want out since i do not have any feelings left for her",1,1729145406.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

Me (M29), Her (F26)","I’ve met this girl from dating app from day one the vibe was amazing, we’re texting everyday and start doing long calls every night. First month is flawless, we go out every week, I plan amazing dates and we have lots of fun, she admits to like me then proceeds to say she has never moved at the peace with anyone and now we’ve become exclusive. 

The first week of the second month we just go to the mall to get her outfit for the concert she’s going to. We finishing shopping and I drive her home, I go to kiss her as usual but I sense her pulling away as if she was not feeling intimate. She says she isn’t feeling well as she’s on her period. I didn’t overthink gave her hug and she went home. For the next three weeks we don’t meet again for a date. She has become “busy” all the time but what confused me is she’ll still put effort to stay in contact. But conversations have definitely gotten shorter and started to take longer to answer.

During this time she says she’s going through some issues at home and she’s not ready to talk about it, I just said I’m here for her if you want someone to listen, as I didn’t want to push her. She says just give me sometime and I will open up, I respected her wishes. Also during this month I was seeing her as I worked near her so I would get her coffee and pick her up from the bus station and drive her to work almost once a week. 

Sometime toward the end of the month we were talking and she sends a picture of her and I answer with a compliment then she proceeds to say she misses me and I reciprocate, then she says she was wondering because I never say it and I told her I thought my actions would show it but you’ve been distant and I thought you needed space. Well after that message she ghost me for three days, she responds after three days and says she had to leave the house as she had a fight with her mom and again she doesn’t want to talk about it. I don’t push and tell her I understand how you feel and I’m here for you.

Now I see her for the fourth time at the bus station to pick her up and chat a bit. This was after the fight with her mom. She gave me a big hug and was hesitantly talking about what happened which got her emotional. I listened for the next half an hour and dropped her off. She gave me a hug thanked me and said she’s feeling better. After she finished word she gives me a call I missed it, I message her and she says she just wanted to chat. We’re now texting like old days and she’s talking about her nails and work and tells me she’s getting them done and will show me tomorrow. At the end of the conversation I ask her did you notice something before you left. I told her I didn’t give you a kiss as your hugs are so nice I forgot “I know cringe”. 

Now I get ghosted again for the next two weeks. She was going on a 10 day vacation during this time. I sent her a casual text and asked her to talk and I get nothing. After 13 days I sent her a text explaining what I liked about her but now I’m left confused on what’s happening and I wished that she told me if she had moved on. 

I get a text from her saying she doesn’t like to be pushed and she’s been feeling a lingering sense of pressure that she didn’t feel at the beginning. She adds that she hasn’t been in a good headspace and she kept pushing me away. Then she says I know that you like me and I felt the same. But she can’t continue because it’s not fair to keep me around while she figures out her life. 

Tbh I was butt hurt, I just wished her the best but man I was hurting. I have dated a bit and I usually get over things much easier. But this one! I felt that I was able to love again and I was falling. I’ve never told her but I didn’t know I had it in me, I didn’t know that I could still feel like that to someone. I don’t know what is it but in a month It felt like she could really be the one. I just didn’t see what happened later coming. 

To add context she is Afghan and I’m Arab. Both Muslim but her mom seems to be racist, she wouldn’t want her to be with anyone but Afghan. But the girl said she would eventually come around. Another thing is I really never pushed her or spammed her. When I wait for her it can be painful but I tried my best to give her space. At the end there was few instances where she tried to gaslight a situation where there was no conflict. Another thing is she didn’t think her emotions mattered and when I ask her how she felt she would say I don’t want to burden you, I try to convince her it’s ok to share these things with me. She really struggled to share how she felt and when she did she’ll go cold for a bit. She does have an abusive mom and her dad has passed away. 

It just that at the beginning she was the most affectionate, loving person I met but the change happened so quick it caught me off guard. ",1,1729145329.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I decided to reply and we got back to chatting again. He is now back in our state but still working out of town in the mountains. We have now been messaging back and forth everyday it seems like for a month. I had asked him to get coffee but he canceled due to his high demand job. I don’t know when this project is over but I am starting to think maybe I should just stop engaging.

Sometimes he won’t message back for a while or he will have shorter messages so I get a little paranoid that he’s trying to stop the communication but he keeps it going. What should I do?

TLDR: I bought a used Vertuo machine from 2016 and a frother that’s probably from the same year. Am I an idiot or is it still good? Seems to work fine but I don’t know for sure. Should I buy the descaling solution from the Nespresso website?

Full story:
Fresh off a high from my recent Eurotrip, I went to purchase a new Nespresso machine on Prime Day. But then I thought to look at Facebook Marketplace first. I saw someone selling this machine along with a frother and some other accessories (reusable pods, coffee grinder that I didn’t need) for “only” $60 (my husband thinks I was ripped off and I’m in denial but he is probably correct.)
The only research I did before purchasing was a reverse image search on Google of the photo of the machine posted on marketplace. It looked like I was buying a $300 machine for $60 so I rushed to the messages and begged to pick it up ASAP. 
When I returned home with what I thought was a total steal, I looked at the back only to see a barcode that is telling me the machine is from 2016. (I assume the frother is from the same year)

They seem to work FINE, but I don’t really have a basis to compare it to. How do I know if it’s in bad shape? Should I buy the descaling stuff on the Nespresso site?

1g5jz6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/1g5jz6q/pumpkin_spice_latte/,Pumpkin Spice Latte,"This is a simple coffee drink that tastes as good as Starbucks IMO. 

If you've seen my other posts most of the stuff that I make is just reworking my existing recipes over to low carb for the boyfriend and is just swapping around ingredients and portion sizes.

I use this recipe when I have leftover pumpkin pie filling.

**Ingredients:**

For the coffee:

* 16 to 24 oz strong coffee
* 2 cups unsweetened plain almond milk or other unsweetened milk (can make a blend of nut milk and cream)
* 1+ tsp vanilla extract 
* 1 to 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice 
* 2+ tbsp pumpkin puree 
* Sweetener (I use allulose)

For the topping:

* 1 cup heavy whipping cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract 
* 2+ tbsp sweetener (I use allulose)
* Pumpkin's pie spice or ground cinnamon or ground nutmeg, etc.
* A pinch of xanthem gum or thickener (optional)

**Preparation:**

Brew your coffee strong!

If brewing espresso, see notes

1. After brewing the coffee, add coffee to a pot, add unsweetened almond milk, vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice (use more or less vanilla and pumpkin pie spice to taste), pumpkin puree (use more or less to taste, some people like it with no pumpkin puree) add sweetener to taste.

2. Heat on medium heat and stir until it is well mixed and the pumpkin pie spice has dissolved or it will be grainy.

3..Pour into cups and enjoy.

**Optional topping:**

For the topping I make a sugar-free whipped topping. 

1. Instead of pouring coffee into cups, cover and put the stove on low so it won't burn and keeps it warm.

2. In a bowl, add heavy whipping cream, sweetener and vanilla extract. The amount of vanilla extract and sweeteners up to individual taste.

3. Whisk until peaks start to form.

4. Sprinkling a tiny bit of xanthan gum (optional)

5. Continue whisking until stiff peaks form.

6. Pour coffee into cups, top with whip topping, sprinkle with optional pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon or nutmeg etc.

7. Enjoy.

**Notes:**

This works with medium roast or dark roast coffee, I prefer it with a darker roast. 

This doesn't work with a blonde roast or light roast because it will overpower the coffee and you won't even taste it.

I put a little xanthan gum in my whipped topping because I use heavy whipping cream that does not have binders and it will start to separate immediately with the hot coffee.

**For espresso brewing**

Brew a few shots of espresso, add the coffee a little at a time into the almond milk mixture until you get the taste and consistency you want.

**My preferred method**

My usual method for morning coffee is pour over or mocha pot but for coffee drinks like this I use a 12 cup stove top percolator.

I make 24 oz coffee.

I use roughly 26 oz of water to 6 tbsp coffee after grinding and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.

Instead of putting the pumpkin pie spice into the almond milk mixture, I put it directly in with the coffee grinds and mix it in before brewing.

That way it is not grainy. I add five extra minutes of brewing time. I brew it in a way it doesn't get bitter even with the extra time so I don't have to use extra coffee.

One of my supervisor, she will add the pumpkin pie spice and extra coffee into her basket with her 12 cup Mr Coffe.

apparently i dodged a massive bullet by quitting sporadically bc not long after i left, i learned that the store i had worked for was the most infamous within our district (amongst partners, esp those who transferred out of the store as well as those who picked up shifts at the location) due to how shitty the working environment was. 

since then, i've been working at a locally owned / small biz cafe job and with the proper training, i've come to really adore the art of coffee and preparing espresso drinks. unfortunately, the pay is— kinda bad LMAO ($1 above min wage), and with a change in management (it used to be owned by a married couple but they got divorced), my hours have been going lower and lower to the point where even if i am happy there, the money isn't enough for my living situation. 

before anyone says anything on the matter - yes, i did ask for more hours and no, the request was not delivered. 

but the tldr is that i'm eyeing starbucks again, mostly bc they're building one in literal walking distance to my house and the pay at sbux in my area is like— $3-4 over min wage here which is definitely something i'm eyeing lol, but i'm unsure if i'd be able to go back given how i left. and again, before anyone says anything, i'm also aware that hour cuts at sbux are also Not the Greatest, but if i'm gonna work crappy pt hours, i'd rather do it with a slightly higher pay 😭",1,1729143666.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

“Did you get in yet? You all are so rude!” Myra pouts, entering the room carrying two trays of breakfast, “I’m literally *the* information lady and you all start the juicy stuff without me?”

Paul snorts, “You were the one who insisted you go to the cafeteria for breakfast. These three have food in their fridge.”

Myra looks down at her plates, then pulls her lips to the side, “Eh, it was worth it. Caleb and the staff are way too good at cooking. Plus, it’s biscuits and gravy today.”

“Wait, for real,” Claire perks up, “Hang on, I might need to run and grab some too.”

“Well, hurry if you’re gonna’,” I call over my shoulder, watching the files on the PC download to the flash drive, “We haven’t started yet, but after these last two sticks, we’re going.” The files finish, and I unslot the device before handing it to Eight, “Here you go, Captain.”

She takes it in her hand and turns it over, “Do I even want to know what sort of messed up shit we’re going to find on here?”

“Probably not,” I sigh, “But we need to look anyway. Remember to take breaks every now and then to go out and mingle. We can’t all just disappear today or it’s going to be way too suspicious. Your files are going to be January through June of last year; tell us if you find anything of note. Go at your own pace, but remember—”

“Yeah, yeah; we only got two days. I gotcha.” Eight nods. She pauses for a moment before walking away, “Good work, Wes—just… by the way. I know I’ve been flipping you two shit a lot lately, but I’m thankful for you trying. I want to help out when you start going back topside.”

I smile slightly, trying to dodge her, “We can talk more later, Captain. But thank you. And thanks for letting us try.”

She nods, then takes her leave, to which I turn to my next customer. I have to adjust my sight line a bit to see his face. With fake reprehension, I put a hand on my hip and scowl.

“And what do *you* think you’re doing here, mister? You should be out playing with your new friends.”

Lyle giggles, then hands me the flash drive Arti must have found, “I wanted to help, but Arti told me this was grown up stuff. She told me I could do this part while she gets me food, though.”

“Ah, well, this part is very important, so you should feel lucky,” I say, swiping the drive, then lightly tapping him on the head with it. I begin copying the files from the P.A.P’s database over, then unsnap it once complete, “Arti’s files are going to be July through December of last year. Can you remember to tell her that for me?”

Lyle puts on a stern face and nods profusely.

I smile, “Good. Now get on out of here, okay bud? I’ll play with you the next cycle I’m down, okay? I promise.”

The boy takes the drive, then hobbles off on his crutches with a smile on his face, and I set to work sorting Tom out last.

Once we have everyone fitted with their files, I take my own PC and join the circle of Val, Claire, Myra, Morgan and Paul in our living room, sinking into the couch next to Val.

“We good to go?”

“Yeah,” I say, “That covers the last 6 years.”

Claire lets disbelief escape her mouth in a sharp puff of air, “That’s a lot of reading…”

“Remember when I called this the ‘less fun’ part of the job and you gave me crap for it?” I smirk to her.

“Eeek for eerself,” Myra says with a mouth full of gravy soaked biscuit. She swallows, then adds, “I’m diving in.”

We all do as well.

The amount of data to sift through far exceeds just the 6 years we have divvied up between us, but those six years are also the files closest related to the mountain and this facility. In other words, the information we need the most. There are maps, employment logs, building schematics for the resort, and, disturbingly, a folder titled *prisoner records*. There are files on top of files containing documents and data regarding things the P.A.P has done all over the globe, and while those are impossibly tempting to dive into, we can’t waste any time on them right now. We need the guarantee of a way forward before we can start sifting through the extra stuff in case we have difficulty getting this information back in the future. Dinner before dessert and all that.

The files start off strange, to say the least, at least my first few do. Myra and Paul had mentioned that anything P.A.P employees experienced during ‘communion’ in the ritual chambers was to be reported in the form of a log, and evidently a lot of what lies in the archives are records of them. They’re all titled similarly, either prefaced with ‘contact’ or ‘communion’, followed by a word that means very little to any of us, but clearly a lot to the P.A.P.

 

*Contact With an Angel:*

*…I felt a presence enter the room and watch me. I stayed still and silent, the link feeling so thin and frail that I feared I might break my communion. I waited for one hour, then two, hoping that the presence might speak to me, but it never did. It’s feeling faded, but even now after leaving the room, I can still occasionally sense it watching me. Down halls and from the vents as I pass by. From the cracks in my wall and from beneath my bed. It’s hiding from me, but I know that it’s never hiding far.*

 

*Contact with the Absolute:*

*There was an immense aura of power and divine fear that I felt so greatly it brought me to my knees. I sat there for what felt like a lifetime—a millennia—tears brought to my eyes by the majesty of it all. I wanted to stay there forever, but eventually, it turned from me, and now all I feel is the need to find it once more. We must find it once more*.

 

*Communion With Longing:*

*… a voice in the dark beckoned out to me, wordless, yet somehow so loud. I felt impossibly drawn to it. Comforted by it. The air smelled sweet and like wet soil. It mentioned my family by “name”, drawing them forward into my thoughts. It told me that I would someday see them again if I found a way to reach it.*

 

*Contact With Desire:*

*I finally felt her. I felt the power of her who we seek so vehemently for. She spoke to me in all her glory—she called me her child—then asked me what it was I came to her for. When I called out, however, the distance was too far, and my cries fell utterly short.*

 

They all read less like professional reports, and more like ghost stories or accounts of those people often thought crazy online, rambling about their experiences ‘seeing through the veil’. At one time I might have thought them insane as well, but knowing what I do now, I can’t say I still do. Other than the beginning part of each log listing the steps taken to conduct the ritual, the rest feels like a random diary entry with no real format to be followed. They have such an odd way of speaking about the things they came into contact with too, almost like speaking with reverence to a deity. The more I read, the more I start to realize that these people down here weren’t just trying to break through into the unknown for science’s sake. They were searching for something bigger. This was something that Mason had told me before his final breaths, but I guess I either just didn’t understand the extent of what he meant, or I let my perception of his madness cloud my belief.

The things that were talking to them from beyond were posing as gods and angels and saviors, and they bought straight into it. They tore the world open to the other side on the promises of better lives and infinite wealth, only to find that they were tearing into a nest of hornets. Maybe they truly thought they were doing good, but reading the reports and seeing how little they actually knew about what they were speaking with, it’s hard to have sympathy with them when they were burned by the candle they lit. That’s not even mentioning all the heinous acts they committed to get here…

Now and then, I do come across a file that contains more scientific, orderly reports. These are actual tests that were run in the lab half of the facility, not the chambers. Most of it is jargon I don’t understand; names of machines that they most likely invented and equations for algorithms that would probably take me a lifetime to understand. What they were doing behind the curtain of all these things is easy to tell, however. They were trying to do what they ended up succeeding in. They were trying to break our world into theirs—or maybe the other way around.

It’s haunting seeing the ‘test failure hypothesis’ section at the end of every document labeled ‘failure’. Seeing them piece together every small detail going wrong, and knowing that with each one, they were only drawing closer to the inevitable. It feels like reading a book you’ve already read before and knowing when a character is about to die. Every time their name is brought up, you wince, knowing they don’t make it to the end, and you count the pages till the moment you know their exit is coming.

*Failed to successfully establish link. No contact made. Perhaps more runoff is needed? Reach out to handlers and prolong sousing period for several more months before next trial. Site 89 recently had success in an all male trial, and by placing 5 bodies to a chamber. Perhaps we can run the same figures with our data and see if it creates a positive match.*

Our whole group sits still for hours across our various rooms, all pouring over document after document till our eyes nearly bleed. The good news is that at least the content is interesting, and not written in a repetitive way. I feel morbid for saying such a statement about such a solemn topic, but I’m not sure how long my brain would have held out if the articles were anything otherwise.

Everyone stands to eventually take a break for an hour or two at a time, first Paul, then Claire, then Val and Morgan. Myra gets up to get her meals throughout the day, but I stay firmly planted, only moving to use the restroom and refill my water. I can’t stop. My brain won’t let me, the need for a way forward burning too hot in my mind. After I become aware how hungry I’m getting, however, I remember what Arti told me, and I leave to grab dinner alone.

My mind is vacant as I move through the halls, an entirely new lens of this terrible building as I pass by all the grotesque portraits and ornate altars. This whole underground is tainted with an evil that I almost feel pulling at my shirt and pant legs as I wade through its suffocating aura. Faces in the hall smile and greet me, and I do my best to do the same, but for the most part, I stay quiet and to myself, only making small talk with the chef that serves me up my food.

I sit at a table on the far side of the cafeteria by myself, facing the lab door and staring at the slate black slab of iron blocking it off. My x-ray vision works hard to imagine all the things that could be back there. All the crimes committed in that room for the sake of progress. It ruins my appetite, but I force the food down anyway and head back to the room. As I reenter, my foggy haze is shaken loose by a cry of surprise.

“Wes!” Val screams, beckoning me over to the crowd huddled around the coffee table. Thirteen sits in the middle of them all, his laptop on his lap and everyone looking over his shoulder.

“Thirteen found it,” Val continues, “He found the sphinx.”

“Well, I think I did,” He quickly dilutes, then begins reading, “*New orders for site 109h: An emergency evacuation has been issued. We are halting all operations at site, including testing, housing, and research, and shall not be returning. Any entrances in or out of 109h are to be sealed immediately using standard procedure, and all deliveries, tests, and data being hosted at site are to be migrated to 109e instead.*

*While site was successful in its original goal, further research conducted on specimen ‘Wisdom’ (Nickname: sphinx), has been deemed too dangerous to continue. The knowledge she offers is invaluable, but she is cunning and unfair in her price for it. Since contact was made, we have only been able to best her three times; a small amount compared to the hundreds of losses.*

*Recently, a disaster was struck when an employee volunteered to challenge her. It is still unclear at this time what the exact bargain that was struck was, but specimen Wisdom was suddenly able to move from her perch and harm all personnel, which she did in a frenzied blitz. Several security teams were dispatched in an attempt to restrain specimen Wisdom, but this was met with the same unyielding results that violence toward her has always been met with. There have been no confirmed survivors at site 109h as of time of report.*

 *This behavior is a stark contrast to her usual dignified nature, as well as a shattering of all known rules regarding her. She is no longer to be trusted, and therefore, any previous research conducted on specimen is to be expunged, as it has proven to be invalid. This should be taken as a final document regarding specimen Wisdom, and she shall be sealed with thin the compound now that she has seemingly returned to her perch. Under no circumstances should anyone approach, challenge, or speak to the sphinx, as interacting still seems to be the only way to allow her leave from her perch, and she appears to be held there, even despite her clear further desire to kill. No one else shall be permitted inside the compound, even to retrieve equipment, personal belongings, or data that was left behind.”*

Thirteen pauses in silence for a moment before looking up at us, “Well…that’s all of the good stuff.”

“Holy crap…” Morgan mutters, staring at the screen.

Val looks at me, and I return it, both of us lost in thought.

“Are you too sure that finding this thing is the next step?” Myra cautions us, “Whatever that thing is down there—if even these people wanted to leave it alone, then…”

Val and I both have the same knowing look in our eye. The one that we always have, no matter how many times we’re cautioned, or told not to do something, or begged not to go. We have to. We both know we have to.

“The sphinx waits below…” I repeat softly, “Saul apparently did it. I think we have to too.”

“Where’s site 109h?” Val asks, “There’s only 7 here at the resort, so that makes 109a-g.”

“Well,” Thirteen starts, pulling up a separate window. On it is displayed a map of the resort, but this one has the top faded and greyed. The bold, black lines show compounds beneath the earth, to which Thirteen hovers his mouse over a smaller, isolated one suspended between the central sight beneath the mountain and the outer compound ring. There’s no tram connecting it, or seemingly any path from the other compounds. Surface access only.

“It seems like ‘H’ was an extra 8^(th) they put in,” Thirteen informs, “You’ve gotta go—”

“Up the mountain…” Claire finishes his sentence, her mouth resting in her hands. It’s clear the log shook her up quite a bit, knowing that she’s now signed up to tag along with Val and I. Still, she’s trying not to show it, “That was another step in the null guys’ mumbling, right?”

I nod, then speak softly, “Claire, this is going to be a pretty crazy first day for you coming out with us. If you want to sit this one out until we can figure out what’s going on…”

The girl regards me for a moment, almost seeming to consider it. Still, there’s a vulnerability behind her eyes that reads crystal clear. Her loneliness. Her fear of being alone down here. Her fear of losing Val and I. She can’t risk not coming. It means too much to her. I can see it all so well in her face, and I can tell that she knows I can. It doesn’t stop her from trying to pull up her apathetic demeanor to dismiss my statement away.

“What? You don’t think I’m ready?”

 

\~

 

Claire stands on the mat, breathing heavy and bobbing on her feet to calm her nerves. It’s been torture waiting down here for so many more cycles after knowing where to go, but we need her to be ready. Ready for Sue. Ready for the sphinx. Ready for all the abhorrent, harrowing things that are out there. And while my stubborn brain insists we get moving as soon as possible, deep down, I know we have all the time in the world to get her there.

We’d done weapons training, stealth, hand to hand, first aid, and we even set up a mini shooting range down an abandoned hall to help Claire practice with the helmet and silenced pistol (a practice I’m sure would not have been sanctioned by Dustin in the slightest). She was particularly good at that last one, meshing well with the helmets guidance and her own skill.

“You ready?” I ask her.

The girl nods, pure uncertainty in her eyes, “Yeah. Yeah, I think so.”

“And you’re *sure* you’re comfortable with this? Like, positive?” I triple check, “I don’t want you to feel—”

Claire smirks at my concern, “Yes, Wes. I’ll be fine.”

“Alright,” I smile softly.

“Thanks for volunteering to help, Tom,” Val tells the pastor, who stands opposite Claireese. “We know it’s a bit of a strange request.

Tom smiles jovially and raises a hand, “Nah, don’t worry about it! I’m just happy to be included in your guys’ stuff lately.”

“Happy to have you too,” Val beams, “Now, remember what we told you; you can’t hold back. I know instinctively that might be hard since you know Claire, and you’re a lot bigger than her, but we need you to give this fight your all. Act like you’re actually trying to restrain her.”

“Copy that,” Tom nods.

‘Bigger than her’ is a massive understatement. Tom is bigger than all of us. The man is a 6’ 7” Giant with plenty of muscle to spare from his military days. We had considered asking Paul, or Eight, or even my Dad to be our final test instead, but both Val and I figured that if Claire can take down the biggest person in our troupe, she’d be ready for anyone that might pick a fight topside. Well, none of us are really ‘ready’ for Sue’s group, but this is the closest we’re going to get.

“Alright, then,” Val says, handing Claireese an uncapped marker, “Rules are simple. Best two out of three. Claire, mark Tom’s neck and you win the round. Get thrown, though, and you lose. You can only mark him if his back or torso is to the floor, but Tom, your goal is to get Claire to the mat at any cost. Once you pin her for a 3 count, you win the round. No hitting or kicking other than to sweep legs; this is a test of technique, not a boxing match.”

“Yes ma’am,” Tom loosely salutes.

“Got it,” Claire nods, shaking out one last time to loosen up.

As Val and I slip on our helmets, Tom asks her, “You sure you’re comfortable with this, Claireese?”

The girl nods, then puts on a confident smile, “You’re going down, old man.”

Tom laughs in surprise, “Old man, huh? Alright. You have it coming now.”

The man takes a stance, as Claire pulls her helmet on too, to which I set my hands on the light switch, “We both ready then?”

Both parties nod.

“Alright. On your marks, get set… go.” I announce, flicking the room into darkness to substitute a gunshot.

It consumes the space, allowing only Val, me and Claire to see, but that doesn’t mean Tom is out of his element. The man’s face actually grows more focused in the void, and he sticks his hands defensively further out in preparation.

Claireese takes two large, slow steps back, masking her sound like a cat’s paws on carpet. Tom doesn’t move in response, he just stays motionless and alert, waiting. He’s well aware that he doesn’t need to make the first move.

Moving softly across the gym, Claireese reaches a dumbbell rack and places her hand to a small five pounder on top, lifting it delicately from its holster and hoisting it into her hand. Despite her caution, a small metallic ‘*ting’* rings out, normally imperceptible, but louder than a gunshot in the silence.

“I hear you over there,” Tom smirks, taking a few slow strides in her direction to apply pressure

 Course correcting, she starts to close back in on the pastor, circling to his side like a lion. He doesn’t hear her skulking this time, and as soon as she’s to his side, his eyes still pointed north, she reels back her arm and gently under-hands a toss back in the direction she was originally standing. Tom’s posture adjusts a bit to accommodate the sound, and the rubber coating of the weight against the mat causes it to bounce a few times, almost mimicking footsteps. Whether Tom actually buys that they are, or is just distracted by the sudden noise is unknown, but whatever it is, we don’t get the chance to find out. The moment the weight hit the ground the first time, Claireese began two massive, ballerina-like strides toward the man before pouncing.

All at once, she leaps in the air as high as she can, wrapping Tom’s neck with her far arm and hooking the same leg around the side of his torso. With all her remaining body weight hanging freely in the air, she jerks her body hard, and despite Tom’s size and weight, the balance change is too strong and sudden, and the man starts to spin to the floor, his momentum naturally turning himself to face the ground. This puts Claireese on top of his back, but Tom’s reaction is too quick, and he’s able to catch himself on his hands. Claireese doesn’t skip a beat, dropping her legs to the floor to leverage herself upward before slamming back down, driving the pastor to the floor like a hammer to a nail. Tom tries to struggle up, but Claire quickly swipes with her marker hand, dashing across the back of his neck.

“Nice one!” Val says, flicking on the lights, “That’s one point Claire. Let’s reset.”

The two help each other up, Tom smiling as they stand, “Ah, is that how we’re going to play it?” He asks, pointing to the dumbbell across the floor from him.

Claireese snickers, but doesn’t respond. The two retake their spots, then, after another count down, the lights go out, and they start again.

Things go similarly to round one, with Claire immediately backing away and Tom holding his ground, but this time, the man keeps on a constant movement, pivoting slowly in case of an oncoming attack. Claire tries her same distraction technique again, this time by rolling a medicine ball in the corner, but Tom doesn’t even flinch.

“That’s not working on me twice, missy.”

 With no other options, Claire stays on the prowl, moving close to the walls to look for an opening. When she can’t find a clear one, she instead waits for Tom to pivot again, timing his movement to where his back is turned before moving in.

To her credit, the girl's steps were perfectly silent again, barely even registering on the sound map, but when Tom’s only current objective is to listen, he very clearly hears them. Claire launches herself again, but when she grapples Tom, he’s ready, and he rolls his body with the girl’s weight so as to not fall over. Claire jerks her body again, trying to use every pound of her body to bring him down, but the pastor still holds strong. Realizing she’s been had, Claireese tries to bail off, but Tom manages to grab an arm of hers before she lets go. Yank all she might, the girl can’t break free, and while in his grasp, Tom sweeps a leg out hard and fast, kicking Claire’s feet out from under her and landing her on her rear.

The man checks his body forward and down on top of her, keeping the arm still in his hand restrained while locking his other across her collarbone to pin her.

“One… two… three…” Val counts, ending her last digit with an underlying disappointment. She flicks on the light, then calls, “It’s alright, Claire, you just gotta get this last one! You’re doing great.”

Tom immediately releases Claireese once the count is done and goes to help her up, but the girl hesitates for a moment, breathing heavy on the ground. She shakes it off, then allows the man to help her, but quickly steps off to the side to remove her helm and catch her breath. She tremulously, yet rhythmically, sucks them in, bouncing on her toes and shaking her arms out to cool off. I can see a distant haze in her irises as she tries to bring herself back to the moment.

“Let’s take a minute,” I say.

“No, I’m good,” Claire quickly reassures.

“Just a second,” I say, “I need to talk to you.”

Tom, sensing the tension and discomfort from Claireese, speaks up for her sake, “I wouldn’t mind a quick breather. These old bones aren’t what they used to be, and you got me pretty good with that first one,” He smiles.

Claireese flashes the fastest courtesy smile I’ve ever seen before nodding and turning away from us, knowing that I’m staring at her. I leave Val and Tom to chat as I approach her.

She still doesn’t look at me even when I’m standing beside her, and it takes a long beat for her to speak, “I’m good, Wes, I swear—I promise I can do this I just—” I can see her starting to tear up, to which her eyes finally break free of the floor and turn to the heavens instead. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”

“Claireese…” I reassure, “You don’t need to be sorry.”

“No, I know, but I am. It’s just so fucking stupid, man.”

“It is *the* *farthest* thing from that…”

“No it is, it’s just—” She finally moves her eyes to me, and I can see they’re tired and scared, like a rabbit run down by a dog. “Back at that last compound, that wasn’t… that wasn’t the first time I was… and it happened so long ago, Wes, and I know I should be over it, but it just… that shit sticks with you, you know? And then it happened again after so many years and—I had buried it so well but then it all came flooding up and—”

Claire starts to hyperventilate slightly, to which I very. *Very.* Gently. Rest my hands on her shoulders. I don’t tell her to look at me or to calm down. I just let my touch notify her that I’m here, and when she’s ready, she does so entirely on her own. We lock eyes for a moment, just allowing the silence to land, and in it, I formulate my response. I scrape my brain for all the semblance of understanding that I have, and once I feel I have it, that’s when I speak.

“Claire, you are not stupid for the things that happened to you. You are not stupid for feeling scared, or hurt, or violated because none of that—n*one of it—*is your fault. I don’t need you to bury it if you want to come with us. I don’t need you to be ‘better’ or ‘cool-headed’ or whatever you feel you need to be. Because while it may not be what you want to hear, once we get up there…”

My eyes drift off somewhere past her, even though they’re still locked to her own.

“All of that pain you’ve faced is going to rear its head whether you like it or not. You’re going to see things that remind you of it. You’re going to feel it wrapped around you all the time. That’s just what the world is now. It’s pain and misery. Keeping that choked down, it’s only going to make it try to claw its way out more aggressively.”

I look back into her eyes. Back at *her.*

“I don’t think that the things we had done to us make us strong, Claire. I always hated that sentiment. It’s like saying that the people who did it to us did us some sort of favor. We’re strong because in spite of what they did to us, we found a way to carry it on our backs every day and keep going.” I give the girl a gentle shake to hammer my next words, “I don’t need you to not be scared, or to ‘suck it up’, Claire. Because deep down, even though we’re all putting on tough faces, I don’t think any of us have.”

Claireese stares at me for a moment longer, a single tear finally breaking free from her eye. She slowly raises her hands to my wrists and wraps them around, squeezing softly and lovingly. She purses her lips, then swallows, nodding her head in acknowledgement.

“You can do this,” I tell her. “I know you can.”

She releases an arm from mine to wipe her eyes, then nods once more, “Then I guess I probably should, huh?”

I snicker, letting my eyes linger on her once more before she steps forward to hug me.

“Thank God I got stuck in this hell with you, Wesly Neyome…” She whispers softly.

I squeeze the small of her back and lay my head into her shoulder, thinking the same thing about her.

Claire and Tom stand face to face, a look of determination on both. Val counts it down this time, and I tap my foot rapidly in anticipation.

“Alright you two. Last round. Winner takes all. You ready?”

“Ready.” Tom nods.

“Let’s do this,” Claire inhales.

 The lights go out, and they start.

Claire forfeits stealth this time, opting for surprise as she rushes Tom like a feral animal. She slams the man's torso, wrapping her arms tightly and hooking a leg behind him to kick the weak part of his own. The attack almost works, shaking Tom and making him stagger slightly. Not giving up the upper hand, Claire pulls her arms sideways with all her might, attempting to use his falter as a means to bring him down. It works, but in the process, Tom bear hugs Claireese on the way to the floor. He lays back up, cradling the girl while she thrashes her limbs wildly to break free. The awkward grapple is too unstable, however, and she manages to slip an arm from her waist and roll off to the side.

Not wanting her to disappear into the shadows, Tom shoots to his side in a wild roll, catching her waist once more and pulling her close. He hoists his body over top of hers, pinning her to the floor face down, and Val starts the count.

“One…”

I can tell Claire is slipping back into her panic. Her arms begin slapping the floor and flailing about, looking for any sort of purchase to pull herself to safety. She cries out small gasps and grunts; empty pleas for relief. It’s hard to watch, knowing the mental torment she’s currently going through, but then she does something that changes my worry to sheer amazement.

“Two…”

Claire stops her arms in place, forcing them to lock into the mat like pillars of iron. Her grunting stops entirely, and instead, she lets out an ear shattering shout, pushing against the earth as if it’s the most repulsive thing imaginable. I watch as all 200 plus pounds of Tom is lifted from the floor on the girl's back, and once high enough, she bucks to the side.

Tom slides off with a thud to the mat, and though he quickly tries to scramble back up to Claireese, she’s ready for it. With all fours, she launches herself toward the man back first, slamming into his chest and pinning him, his back to the floor. Her weight is hardly enough to keep him there, but it doesn’t matter. The girl pulls her body back along with her arm, back-swiping the marker masterfully across the front of Tom’s neck.

With that, she falls off the man, wrenching her helmet off and gasping for air before collapsing over. Val kicks the lights back on and instantly runs over, sliding to her knees beside the girl.

“You did it!” She yells with elation, “Claire, you won!”

Claireese doesn’t respond at first, only gasps in breath after breath, her muscles limp against the ground from the sudden intense use. Finally, once she can speak again, she rolls her head to look at the girl, speaking between pants, “Does this… mean… I can finally join… your stupid ass club?”",1,1729143075.0,InkWielder,0,1.0,False

1g5jlyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1g5jlyc/still_not_over_him/,Still Not Over Him,"This is very long. I just needed to breathe and vent.

I am 35yo (M) with some Anxious Attachment (AA) Issues. 

A couple years prior and currently, I have engaged in therapy for this and studied it. Read plenty of books about it and healthy communication. 

I’ve been married twice, divorced twice. My ex-Husbands, had their own issues with untreated depression, anxiety, Bipolar, Alcoholism. Yes, there is some co-dependency issues I am working on.

It’s been 6-months since NC. Although my ex-boyfriend 29yo had reached out only two times, to ask me to pay for a overdue vet bill, still in his name, for my (our) cat, and to remove himself off the mortgage. 

I know, I won’t reach out, but sometimes it’s so hard. I do, love him so much still. Sometimes, I still cry on my way home from work. I still breakdown at the kitchen cleaning dishes by myself. 

—

I do wish this was easier. Did I ever see it coming? No, not really. 

This relationship felt so real and supportive. He and I had been through similar situations, dating narcissistic people, who took advantage of our generosity.

We also had so much in common, from the taste in music, to foods, gardening, reading and movie genres, video games, 420, exercise, drawing, painting, singing in the car, laughing at the same jokes. 

Healthy set of differences too, I enjoyed football and working on construction projects around the house, he’d rather chill, but would help out or join the airing of the Super Bowl.

We both were like two peas in a pod, we did everything together. 

I am more of the planner, he more much more lackadaisical. He was a scientist, I a nurse. 

—-

Some stark differences is I had much more life experience and accomplishments in my career. He was just starting out. 

I been through the trudges of shit relationships, years of therapy. He, did it once, didn’t like it, and prefers self-reflection and he had just gotten out of a 5-year long abusive relationship just before we had started dating.

But then after 1.5 years together — he left me. After weeks of withdrawing, weeks of shifting his focus, weeks of my anxiety going through the roof that “he doesn’t love me, or that I am not good enough.” 

He finally said it, that “I was the first ‘good’ thing that has happened to him in a long time,” so that “maybe he doesn’t actually love me in a romantic sense,” — he has been considering this. After he’s felt too many incompatibilities in values and wants. 

He said he has to consider that maybe we were just meant to be friends. Not lovers. 

He said that “I loved my work more than him,” and that I over extend my help to my family, as not only did I buy a house for us, but still own another home in another state, to help my aging parents. 

I have renters and yes … I do work a lot of overtime. All for a purpose. I have my sights set on cashing in on equity, buying a multiplex etc.

He said that “That we never spend enough time together.”

Even though, we literally would be always together. Sure … a few hours a day, because of work etc. We would go stargazing up in the mountains with the telescope I got him, we would have painting dates with wine, we would relax in the jacuzzi at night, we play video games way longer than we should have, we’d cook dinner together, we go jogging and exercise together. 

I planned a holiday trip for our parents to meet — all of which he said “was what I wanted, not him.”

——

Now he is cold, he is full of hate. He blames me for everything falling apart because I would get so frustrated over how unmotivated he was in helping out around the house. Or how hurt and upset I had gotten when he forgot to plan out our date, even though I had been looking forward to it.

Or how I finally broke down and asked him if he was cheating on me, with the ‘straight guy,’ at work, who coincidently had only just come out as ‘bi-curious,’ to my ex, despite this “straight man,” would soon be getting married to his finance, who he had dated for 5 years. (I feel so bad for her). 

His immediate response was anger at being accused of such. Flipping the question back at me. All the while making me feel insignificant for even asking a thing. Saying I am being manipulative etc. 

Yes, I know he was gaslighting me, he still refused to accept that he did. Yet, long before, at the beginning of our relationship, he and I would communicate so effectively and empathetically. Knowing what we both been through.

After writing all this out, I feel better. I feel more clarity and just have to remind myself. 

It’s not worth it. He left all that behind, convinced I am the problem.

Interestingly, his mother, when going up, had untreated bipolar. She was single and also a nurse, raising 3 boys. I find it coincidental, just a little, that he does not feel loved by her, or feels like she loves his brothers more than him, despite her being quite a brilliant and wonderful person, who has some issues.

Maybe she worked too hard, too many hours and the household was unstable with hot-and-cold love.

Maybe he is just triggered because he feels he is in the same boat as he was when a child.

——-

Either way, I am just so saddened. I truly thought he was the one. I still feel it. After 2 years of courting each other at the coffee shop, before he moved on to a new job. Not realizing we both had crushes on each other. 

To finally breaking the question because one of us was going to be leaving for good soon. To our first beautiful date, playing Mario Kart at the arcade and purposely leaning extra close to pop in some quarters, feeling the tension and sparks.

He obviously is an Avoidant, maybe Fearful Avoidant (FA). I just wish, my love did not suffocate him and trigger his anxieties. It’s kind of crazy how he literally said in the last break in NC, “it’s almost been a year,” — referring to our breakup. >_> I’m like … it’s only been 6-months.

Sadly, I wish I didn’t wake up. I am so tired, of busting my butt and the constant rinsing and repeat of poor choices in a partner. 

I’ve done a lot in my life, seen a lot too from traveling and being an ICU nurse. I feel content with what I’ve given to this world.

1g5jk7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1g5jk7s/my_grandfather_passed_away_the_last_emotional/,My grandfather passed away. The last emotional connection I had to the Nfamily is gone. ,"I loved my grandfather so much. He lived a beautiful life of almost 98 years, only suffered a bit over the last couple of weeks or so, was physically and mentally healthy otherwise. 

He was NDad’s father and pretty much a 180° opposite personality. He was so laidback, hardly ever lost his temper, and on the rare occasions he did, he just took a couple of hours to himself, books/coffee/TV to calm down, instead of going down the route of his asshole of a son, with the eviction threats, physical violence, and passive aggressive infinite loops of statements/questions in which you could never win. I really don’t know where NDad gets it from. He kept calling my grandpa a loser because he wasn’t ambitious. Just wanted a stable income and a respectable job, both of which he had until he retired at ~80. 

Grandpa was my only source of joy. I used to shake with fear after one of NDad’s episodes. And EMom, Golden child sibling, and scapegoat sibling were useless, actually finding their ways to bully me or make me (lost child/lost sibling) even worse. Grandpa made me smile. He taught me how to low-key defy NDad, none of the other grandparents I’ve ever known has ever undermined the parents’ authority like this, except for my rockstar of a grandpa. No one in the Nfamily except for grandpa ever accepted me for the way I was. Just a timid, harmless person who wanted a quiet life as long as I had my books, my TV, my walks, and my food. 

Being in an Asian family comes with a very stereotypically well-known set of challenges. People around whom you grow up are typically over ambitious, overachievers, over competitive, over-thinkers. I was the black sheep of the family for not making six-figures unlike my siblings and cousins. Not in the eyes of grandpa. My siblings and cousins were lost for conversational topics around him, but for me, usually shy and reserved, the words would just flow effortlessly around him. He was smart and academically oriented too, had a bunch of degrees back when hardly anyone studied, but he hardly defined himself by that, and never looked down upon people who weren’t academically inclined. 

In an era where the son’s education was emphasized over that of the daughter’s, grandpa made it a point that EAunt would learn as much as NDad, unless SHE wanted to give up on education earlier. NDad hated him since he decided to split his real estate investments equally instead of giving it all to the son, the self-proclaimed king of the family (he has referred to himself as such multiple times, so I’m not the one making this stuff up). Where I come from, parents NEVER left property in the name of the daughter, grandpa was an anomaly. As his granddaughter, I’ve never felt any “less” than I would’ve as his grandson. However, as NDad’s daughter, I was made to feel less than a son everyday since the day  there was a coherent thought in my head. 

I could write pages and pages about him, but I’m still too emotionally fragile to do so. Besides, this isn’t the subreddit for it. Thinking of the road ahead now. My contact with NDad and EMom was minimal at best, getting updates about grandpa’s health and general life, since he himself couldn’t hear through the phone that well anymore. We just got on video calls through NDad and he asked me questions and NDad would relay my answers to him. I have been estranged with Golden child sibling and scapegoat sibling since early COVID days when the bullying got too extreme to the point of them actually sincerely requesting me to unalive myself because I was such a burden on the family (no doubt, values inculcated by NDad). But, now that grandpa is gone, I see no reason to stay in touch with NDad or EMom. They never loved me, never wanted me, so why bother? They say most grandparents and grandkids get along so well because they have a common enemy, and idk if it’s a joke, but it was actually true for me and grandpa. We easily bitched about NDad and EMom. Now that he’s gone, I have no family left. Well, biologically, there’s still tons of family, but emotionally, I’m not connected to any of them. 

I have been thinking of an estrangement, although I don’t know what I’ll do if my job (which is already volatile) kicks me out. Maybe completely cursory conversations are the way ahead. Definitely no more calls. Don’t wanna see their faces or hear their voices ever again, I only tolerated them for grandpa (and grandma, who predeceased grandpa by 7 years). I am grieving and in extreme emotional pain, but neither NDad nor EMom have bothered to check on me. Absolutely hate the fucking “He was 97, you gotta move on, this was long overdue” nonchalant attitude they have about his death. I somehow feel responsible. My medico best friend would often advise me when I consulted her about his health concerns. Her advice was actually very helpful. And just this time, I didn’t consult her because I was too stressed about my own new job and stuff. And he’s gone where I’ll never see or talk to him again, because I couldn’t handle my stress better and take 10 seconds away from my preoccupations. That friend had made me promise to invite her for his 100th in return of her medical advice. I couldn’t hold on to him for just 2.5 more years. We often talked about how he had seen two decades of 20s (1920s and 2020s) and about how she wanted to reverse adopt him as her own grandpa after her grandparents were gone. Inevitably, I disappointed her too. But I remind myself that constantly feeling disappointed and guilty is a sign of being raised by NParents, a regression. That grandpa’s life/death weren’t really in my control. But I can’t shake off this unpleasant feeling I’ve been having since he was gone. Till a day before his last, I kept thinking he’d get out of it and be back home. He had actually got out of seemingly worse health scares 2 years earlier. I got complacent. I didn’t pray hard enough. I didn’t do enough for the underprivileged. Needless to say, NDad is being all smug, making it all about him. How he took timely action and “let” grandpa live on “borrowed time” since the second-to-last health scare. I deeply and sincerely wish that it was NDad’s funeral pyre that was being lit up this week instead of grandpa’s. But, if wishes were horses, …

Somehow this rant is making me angrier about the injustice of it all. I’m sorry for being so unstructured. But I’m just going to end the rant here. ",2,1729142512.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1g5jius,https://i.redd.it/84qwig1049vd1.jpeg,WS Premium Social: Event Summary,"Haven’t seen a review of the premium social events so here’s mine:

I attended the WS Premium Social event in Calgary yesterday, and it was.. quite an enjoyable evening. We were encouraged to bring a non-WS client as a +1, but it really didn’t matter. They chose a nice inner-city venue and had a live string ensemble for ambiance. Complimentary sparkling wine and appies were served, and two free drink tickets were given to attendees upon entry. Much of the evening was mingling and networking with others. Around halfway through, the CEO (Mike) spoke, as did an early <10 employee. It was great to see Mike socializing with attendees at the event b/c even though he’s led a company through almost $1B in funding rounds, he wasn’t too “important” to attend a social event across the country. Other WS staff were also around and open to chat.

Mike mentioned the event was fully reserved within 90 minutes of sending out the invite, so if you ever get an invite—act fast! (I doubt all premium clients in Calgary were invited, and no I am not sure why I was one of them lol). 

They gave us all gift bags on the way out. The swag (coffee & candle) is Calgary local, so I’m sure it is unique to each city’s event. Sure, there’s some sales stuff in there too, but I get it—they have a job to do. Also the TLDR paper is rather impressive! I can elaborate on the content in there if anyone is interested.

It’s clear a lot of effort was put into the event, and I want to thank WS for putting it on. I felt important for an evening, and my trust in WS as a company has grown even more. I’m excited for what they have next in store!

training at gym. 

A little background: I followed IF, and did home workouts+500-1000 jump ropes between 2021 and 2022 and lost 10kgs being at 62kg. My diet was veggies+slice of seer fish+4 egg whites for lunch and for dinner soup+veggies+occasionally chicken. 
I lost a great deal of weight with slight bones appearing near ribcage and i was very proud. Belly shrunk very well too!

Fast forward 2024, I gained back all the 10kgs and I started doing home workouts by July 2024. I couldnt follow IF or and diet then because of work, my work is 4pm to 1am. Gym from 11am to 1pm. And wfh was not an option. August 2024 I joined gym and started working on diet. 
But there was no change in weight till date. Just lost 1.5kg which i think is mainly because of diet. My diet still remains the same as above, i take filter coffee and protein shake and fruits for mid day snacking. But im NOT on IF.

I have a 2 year old and a wife in her third trimester. The day-to-day has its moments of pure joy and happiness but it’s surrounded by stress, anxiety, depression, exhaustion, and overwhelming expectations. 

Quick background: we have no help from family or friends where we live as far as babysitting. I have been on probably 3-4 dates with my wife in 2 years and every date requires a $100-$150 babysitter. My child doesn’t sleep well, so we have to be there to put her to bed at 9pm; then we can go out. Or a day date at 2pm, but we have to be back for dinner or else she won’t eat unless we use specific “tactics.”

I’m unable to enjoy any hobbies or friendships. My wife and I feel more distant each month that passes. We are just engulfed by the responsibilities of maintaining a home, raising a kiddo, and working enough overtime to maintain the stay at home wife lifestyle that we sought after. 

Question: my patience is constantly running low and I’m always grumpy and kind of an a-hole. I can feel myself doing it, but I can’t stop it. Little things set me off and I feel like if I hold it in, it will be even worse. I just feel like I NEED moments of peace throughout the day, that I never get. I really value alone time and time to “warm up” for the day; like drinking coffee and doing one productive thing before the toddler wakes up. I NEVER get that and it drives me insane for the rest of the day. Baby wakes up at 5am so it’s pretty hard to wake up before her. How do I help myself? My resting heart rate increases daily, I grind my teeth more and more, I feel on edge constantly, and don’t feel happy at all. Only time I’m happy is after some alcohol, in the garage, listening to music. I feel like a damn loser, but I’m just not coping well with being a Dad. The 100% requirement of my attention is EATING AT ME. If I look away for a second the toddler if freaking eating a marker or crayon, or pulling the dogs hair. My only break is doing home renovations. But the more I do that, the more my wife gets her stress cup filled and I return to a crazy house the second i finish the home project. 

How the hell do you fathers handle this? I know im not the only one dealing with this situation. I didn’t have a father growing up, or else I would ask him.

1g5jfb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1g5jfb7/how_to_choose_the_right_coffee_table_for_your/,How to Choose the Right Coffee Table for Your Sofa Style,"Selecting the perfect coffee table for your living room can seem like a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be! A coffee table is more than just a functional piece—it's an essential element that ties the room together. When choosing the right coffee table to complement your sofa style, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind. Whether you’re drawn to a cozy, rustic vibe or sleek modern aesthetics, finding the ideal table is about balancing style, function, and harmony with your sofa. Here’s how to get it right:

**1. Match the Shape with Your Sofa Configuration**

The shape of your coffee table plays a big role in how the space flows. If you have a sectional sofa or an L-shaped couch, opt for a rectangular or oval table to ensure that it fits comfortably within the space. For smaller, more compact seating arrangements, a round or square table is ideal. Round coffee tables, in particular, can soften the look of a room and work well in spaces with lots of straight lines.

If you're going for a cozy, organic look, consider a [rattan coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/ava-rattan-coffee-table). Its natural texture and round shape can add a relaxed, bohemian vibe to your space, which pairs beautifully with neutral or light-colored sofas.

**2. Choose Materials that Complement the Sofa’s Aesthetic**

When it comes to material, your coffee table should harmonize with the fabric and style of your sofa. For a modern or industrial-style sofa, a metal coffee table is a bold and stylish option. It adds a sleek, contemporary feel to the room, especially when paired with leather or dark-colored sofas. The clean lines of a [metal table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) contrast nicely with soft upholstery, creating visual interest.

On the other hand, if your sofa leans toward a boho or coastal vibe, a rattan coffee table can complement the relaxed and earthy tone of your decor. The woven texture adds warmth and texture, while its natural material feels airy and inviting. Rattan pairs particularly well with linen or fabric sofas in light or neutral tones.

For those with a modern or minimalist sofa, a [black coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/lucas-black-coffee-table) offers a striking contrast. Whether in wood, metal, or glass, a black table provides a chic, sophisticated look. It works exceptionally well with white or light-colored sofas, giving the room a sleek, contemporary edge.

**3. Get the Height Right**

Your coffee table should be proportionate to the height of your sofa. The general rule of thumb is to choose a table that is the same height or slightly lower than your sofa’s seat cushions. This ensures that the table is functional and comfortable to use. If you have a low-profile, modern sofa, a taller coffee table can throw off the balance, making the space feel awkward.

For example, pairing a rattan coffee table with a low sofa creates a cozy, laid-back look, while a metal table that’s too high could disrupt the visual flow of the room.

**4. Consider Functionality**

In addition to style, think about how you’ll use your coffee table. Will it serve as a place for drinks and snacks, or will you use it to display decorative items like books and vases? For a family-friendly space, a sturdy rattan coffee table is a great option, offering both style and durability. 

If you want something that makes a statement, a black coffee table can serve as a focal point in the room, anchoring the space and drawing attention with its bold color.

For smaller living rooms, a metal coffee table with a minimalistic design can help save space while adding an industrial edge. Look for tables with storage or multi-functional features to maximize your room’s potential.

**5. Balance Colors and Textures**

When selecting a coffee table, think about how it will complement your sofa’s color and texture. A black coffee table adds a touch of drama to light-colored sofas, creating contrast that feels modern and sleek. If your sofa is already a bold color, opt for a more neutral or textured coffee table like rattan to avoid overwhelming the space.

Meanwhile, a metal table works beautifully with plush, fabric sofas. The sleek finish contrasts with softer textiles, bringing a sense of balance and harmony to the room.

**Conclusion**

Choosing the right coffee table for your sofa style doesn’t have to be complicated. Consider the shape, materials, height, and functionality to find the perfect match. Whether you're looking for a rattan coffee table to bring a natural, bohemian vibe, a black coffee table for a striking modern look, or a metal table for a sleek, industrial touch, there's a perfect coffee table out there for every sofa style.

By keeping these tips in mind, you can create a cohesive and stylish living room that feels both functional and beautiful.",1,1729141963.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

***Prologue:***

Life is good in a Utopia. Without the stress of money and ""getting ahead"", the inhabitants are free to pursue their dreams. Some choose to spend their days creating beautiful art and music, or just devoting their time to raising their families. Some choose to work their dream jobs, either for fun or to make the world an even better place.

Viennetta and Iguana chose to pursue their shared love of music, raising their children in a house that was never silent. Wilburforth was a musical prodigy who focused on music more than his twin daughters. It's a wonder he ever made time for romance in the first place. Their mother Kinley passed away shortly after the girls became teenagers, and it's speculated that this tragic event is what inspired Aramina's first hit song ""Insert Name Here"".

Aramina continued making music and earning fame until one day she was invited to compete in the reality tv show ""I'm too rich for this!"". The show, spawned by a recent media craze of fallout shelters, had a simple premise: 8 celebrities were confined to an underground bunker with only the bare necessities, competing in challenges and doing their own housework. The last one to tap out would be the winner. Aramina wasn't overly fond of the idea. She knew reality tv show contestants are picked based on viewer engagement - more drama means a higher view count. Which meant that the bunker would be an explosive mix of personalities and egos. Unfortunately for Aramina, her agent managed to convince her to say yes.

Be celebrity. Join reality TV show. Be trapped with rich drama queens for the rest of your life. FML.

In evergreen harbour, the acid rain poses two threats: the rain itself, and the toxic fumes that are created when the acid rain comes into contact with the new eco-friendly material that the council has been using to beautify the neighbourhoods. Unfortunately it turns out that the Gunk!™ they use can be melted & solidified indefinitely. So every time it rains, the roads, sidewalks, buildings, roofs... everything melts and releases toxic fumes.

***1. Aramina Swann.***

While waiting to film her entrance video, before the cameras were rolling, Aramina spotted Johnny Depp and decided right then and there to tick something off of her bucket list. She sauntered over to her celebrity crush and put on her most sultry voice. The two snuck away to a dark corner of the dressing room and made a memory that each of them would brag about later that night.

Contestants were only allowed to bring in the clothes on their backs, supplies (such as birth control, for instance) were not provided. And so it was that only a few days into filming, Aramina discovered she was pregnant. The producers agreed to let her stay in the competition, promising to get her a midwife and everything she would need for a ""home"" birth, so long as she agreed to do frequent ""check-ins"" in the Diary Room.

At one such visit to the Diary Room, her highly emotional state activated the Tragic Clown painting and a new housemate was summoned. While some housemates were uneasy around the crying clown, others apparently found her irresistible.

The first week was off to a rocky start, with petty dramas and clashing personalities. But the group was civil as they excitedly gathered around the TV, waiting to hear about the first challenge they would face. Instead, the producer himself appeared on the screen and solemnly announced a state of emergency had been announced, and that none of them would be allowed to leave even if they wanted to. He cautioned them to be sparing with their supplies, as he did not know when they would be able to extract the group, or whether they'd even be able to deliver more supplies.

As the TV shut off, the group of celebrities looked around at each other, trying to determine what everyone else was thinking before they themselves chose a reaction.

Judith Ward, always seeking the spotlight, decided to be the first to speak up. She waved her hand in the air gracefully yet dismissively, and stated that it was clearly a joke. In her opinion, this was their first challenge - to be left in faux isolation with only the supplies they had on hand. The part about the world ending was merely a ploy to encourage drama and discord.

Most of the others were inclined to take the producer seriously, and some even started to panic. Aramina frankly didn't think it mattered whether it was true or just a theatrical way of announcing their challenge - either way the result was the same. And so she took charge of inventory when the group broke into the supplies room.

They found they had a significant amount of canned & frozen meals, including some very luxurious dishes clearly intended as rewards for those who won the challenges. They also found some musical instruments, blankets & linens, some seed packets, some minor electronics, and an overcrowded keychain (it looked like there were probably keys for every room in the bunker). Not very much of it would be helpful to them, but the food was eagerly eyed by those with spoiled palates.

Despite Aramina's attempts to ration the food, it turned out that rich people have no self control and they were taking whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted it, and wasting a lot of food. Judith Ward wasn't the only one just tossing aside an entire dish that didn't suit their tastes.

Aramina and BigSquish decided at once to plant the seeds they found. They knew there was a garden here, they could see it through the clouded glass door. After trying several keys, they finally managed to unlock the garden. Some of the others would occasionally help out in the garden, but it ended up being mostly the two of them. They became good friends and BigSquish was a shoulder for Aramina to cry on. He was her main source of comfort when she worried about getting the medical assistance she needed for her pregnancy & birth. He told her that even if the promised midwife didn't come, they had electricity, water, and a sanitary environment. She would be ok. He even made a bassinet for her out of some spare linens and a plastic tub.

Aramina's pregnancy was soon followed by others, as they still had not been provided any birth control and apparently celebrities have very little self control. Even Judith Ward got in on the fun and took a saucy trip to the closet with Johnny Depp, which unfortunately resulted in an unwanted pregnancy. Ms. Ward milked it for all it was worth, hogging the Diary Room and turning every conversation into a venting session about how unlucky she was, poor poor Judith Ward.

With all these extra housemates on the way, and still no update from the producer or any of the staff, they decided to unlock every door and find out exactly what they were working with. And so it was that they found a luxury floor beneath their ""austere"" living arrangements. This floor was intended for relaxation and had a gym, all sorts of luxurious recreational activities, and a decadent winners suite with a private bathroom. Thankful that they could finally use a real toilet and avoid the outhouse upstairs, the group descended and decided to have a party to celebrate.

The first death in the house came when Judith Ward decided to prove that she was independent and fix the coffee machine by herself. She left behind one daughter.

With Judith's death and no word from the producers, child services, or anyone at all from the outside world, it became obvious that this was real. They really were stuck down here while some sort of dire emergency was going on above ground. They somberly agreed that they were in it for the long haul, and began taking things more seriously. The remaining housemates decided to raise Judith Ward's daughter together.

Johnny Depp soon found he was the father to yet another pregnancy. In his distracted state of mind he shouldn't have tried repairing the stereo. He soon followed Judith Ward to the grave, as Robert Downey Jr. failed to seduce the Grim Reaper into sparing Johnny's life.

***2. Beyauteigh Swann (pronounced ""Beauty"")***

Beyauteigh was a toddler when ""Aunty Judith"" passed away, and growing up she felt strongly protective of her half-sister Brahndeighy (pronounced ""Brandy""). The two were inseparable and shared a love of daring fashion. With a complete studio wardrobe on hand, the girls experimented with wild looks and wild partying. They both ended up pregnant as teens, which caused a stir among the adults. Despite the fact that the men that had gotten them pregnant were significantly older than them, the teen girls were treated harshly while the fathers to their children received no social repercussions.

However, none of the original housemates made it to old age. These spoiled celebrities simply weren't prepared for the realities of survival. Many died to household mishaps when trying to repair electronics or cook a meal. Many others died from ""excessive living"", staying in the sauna too long, swimming when they simply didn't have the energy, many nearly starved to death when the original supplies had run out.

With the older generation gone, the younger generation built their own social norms and quite frankly created far more drama than their parents had. With so much luxury and nothing important to do, the new generation of housemates spent most of their time hooking up and fighting with their love rivals.

***3. Cheysee Swann (pronounced ""Jessie"")***

Cheysee was not in fact an only child, but you would be forgiven for thinking so. Cheysee was in fact the 7th child born to Beyauteigh and Will Smith, but as the first born without blonde hair (which her mother hated), Cheysee was doted upon to the exclusion of all the other children.

Baby Cheysee was spoiled rotten from day one, and rarely needed to do anything for herself. She never cleaned up after herself, she left all the work for others to do, and when she became a teenager her overwhelming sense of entitlement led to her stealing the key to the ""winner's suite"", so that only she could use it.

She had also temporarily been the only one with access to the lower ""luxury"" floor, but there was such a strong outcry against her act of selfishness, that she relented. Utilizing her impressive powers of charisma, Cheysee proposed that only parents could access the lower floor. All toddlers and children would remain on the first floor, being cared for by those who had not yet procreated. Those who had already become parents were free to wander the entire house as they saw fit.

Those who had already had babies, or who were currently pregnant, seized this opportunity, and all dissenters were quickly shut down. And so it was from that day forward, that anyone who had created new life was deemed an ""adult"" and that only ""adults"" were allowed on the lower floor. This system worked out marvellously, although it had the side effect that the breeding generations became shorter and shorter as everyone hurried to become a parent in order to gain access to the luxuries of the lower floor.

Despite her ego and unfounded sense of entitlement, Cheysee had no trouble making friends. There was very little fighting in this generation, possibly because the housemates began focusing on hobbies and enjoyment, rather than on their love lives. For them, ""love life"" just meant ""find someone to hook up with so that you can go live on the lower floor"". Very few of them had any interest in real relationships, and they mostly just spent their time pursuing art, music, or fitness.

Fashion was a big passion of Cheysee and her close friends. They were stylish and everyone in the house envied them, going so far as to copy their baby names. After Cheysee's first child, ""Deyrikklynne"", a craze swept the household and soon every girl born was given a masculine name with ""Lynn"" attached to the end of it. Cheysee's older sister Caelynn tried to start a naming fad for boys, but ""Lynn-Jawn"" just didn't take off like Caelynn had hoped.

***4. Deyrikklynne Swann (pronounced ""Derek-Lynn"")***

All the reckless hooking up, which had begun even before the apocalypse started, led to a problem for the ""Lynn"" generation (so named because of the naming craze which swept the house). When Deyrikklynne tried to find a partner she was stumped to find that there were no suitable candidates for her. Only a handful of those born to this generation were able to partner up easily, the rest weren't sure what to do. Without a partner they couldn't become a parent, and thus would forever be stuck on the ""lame"" floor.

Luckily, in an exceedingly creepy turn of events, the show was still being broadcast on the local automated tv station. Unbeknownst to the housemates, hundreds of people across Evergreen Harbour were watching their every move. In a house only a few streets away, was a sim named Goopy Carbonara. When he was a child his parents went out to seek supplies and never returned, leaving him to survive on his own. He had grown up watching the show and felt a deep connection to the inhabitants of the house. He was so moved by Deyrikklynne's plight that he moved heaven and earth to be with her.

One day an alarming amount of noise gathered the housemates to the kitchen, where they discovered the noise was originating from the entry door, which no one ever opened. They had all gathered by the time Goopy broke through the door into their little world.

Until this point, the children born into the house had no idea that there was an outside world. Their parents had never bothered educating them, assuming that someone else would do it. When Goopy burst in, ripped off his home-made bioprotective suit, and proclaimed his undying love for Deyrikklynne, it didn't take her long to realise he was her ticket into the paradise of parenthood. So naturally, she accepted his advances and he became the newest housemate.

Goopy brought with him news of the outside world, and made them aware of both their lack of privacy & their fame. He showed them how to use the mail system to retrieve the fanmail which had been building up for decades. He explained that the postal service had been automated by postbots which were immune to the toxic fumes but not the acid rain. So the postbots were grounded on rainy days, but were able to complete their routes when the weather was dry enough.

All the housemates really understood was that being famous meant strangers sent you things in the mail. This led to the realisation that being famous and loved by strangers can make your life better, so naturally all of the housemates began competing for an intangible audience.

While the others created drama to try to fuel their own fame, Goopy suggested that Deyrikklynne take a softer approach and pursue art. She did have an old digital sketchpad, and no one ever used the storage room, so she could easily commandeer it as her own private retreat. And so she began locking herself away in seclusion, cultivating a hot-headed personality tempered by a sensitive artistic side. Her art wasn't very good and it took her some time to improve, but the fans sent letters encouraging her.

The other housemates were frankly a little bit scared of Goopy, so when he announced that Deyrikklynne needed the most comfortable couch in the house moved into her ""studio"", the others didn't say a word. They were quite relieved that Deyrikklynne had decided to spend most of her time locked away for ""peace and quiet"", so that they didn't have to deal with her increasingly antagonistic personality.

Goopy spent most of his time worshipping Deyrikklynne, waiting on her hand and foot. He would hover outside the storage room for hours just in case his goddess needed something.

When the twins were born, the four of them moved downstairs into the luxury winner's suite, ignoring the ""no children downstairs"" rule. The other housemates weren't pleased about this, but they were too scared of Goopy to speak up.

Though the housemates often saw Goopy running to the kitchen to fetch meals, the small family unit stayed mostly within the winner's suite. The worst that the housemates had to put up with was Deyrikklynne sighing and making a big fuss about how awfully difficult it is to be an artist in such a busy and mundane household, but that was only on the rare occasions when she left the luxury suite and headed to her little ""studio"" in the supply room.

All in all, the other housemates found the new arrangement quite peaceful, and decided to call it a win. With Goopy no longer hanging around the kitchen glaring at anyone who made a noise, the other housemates began cooking together and socialising more. They forged strong bonds of friendship that drew in the viewers who were seeking a sense of normalcy in this apocalypse.

***5. Elyxandaireh Swann (pronounced ""Alexandra"")***

Elyxandaireh suspected that her childhood wasn't normal. Raised on a reality tv set underground, by a minor celebrity and their stalker. It didn't help that her mother alternated between calling them ""just a normal family"", and gushing about how special her family was - depending on which viewers she was trying to reel in that day.

Frankly, Elyxandaireh had a bit of anxiety about being watched 24/7. She didn't see why her mother insisted on having a drone follow her around streaming everything she did, when there was already cameras in almost every room of the house. In her childhood Elyxandaireh had found every camera-free place in the house and was often chided by her mother for hiding in the blind spots instead of letting her ""show off her precious daughter"". When she became a teen, Elyxandaireh took over her mother's ""studio"" (the little storage room) and covered up the only camera inside. Although she detested being filmed, she knew that she needed fame to survive in here, and so she found ways to garner fame without selling her privacy. She was a gifted artist, and she enjoyed writing. With these two skills she wrote & illustrated many children's books, which were best sellers within the apocalyptic town of Evergreen Harbour. She never read her fanmail, instead letting her mother read them aloud on her streaming channel. Finally she had gotten her mother off of her back.

Until the day that Deyrikklynne decided it was time to be a grandmother. No one in the previous generations had lived long enough to meet their own grandchildren, and Deyrikklynne wanted to be the first. Elyxandaireh could withstand her mother's constant nagging, and simply hide away in the storage room, but Deyrikklynne was insistent and began harassing the other housemates, trying to prevent them from pairing up and having children.

When Dequidynt (pronounced ""Decadent"") narrowly avoided steaming to death in the sauna, Elyxandaireh announced her intentions to find a mate. To be honest, she was worried about the lengths her mother might go to to become the first living grandparent on the show. Elyxandaireh will never be sure, but deep down she suspects that her mother was responsible for the mysterious accident which had locked Dequidynt in the sauna for a full day.

To maintain peace (and safety) in the house, Elyxandaireh quickly made her choice of partner and approached him. However, Errrrrrrrl (pronounced ""Earl"") was also being pursued by Eyleicha (pronounced ""Alisha""), and his behaviour when he found that two girls were ""fighting"" over him turned Elyxandaireh off completely. So she approached her second choice Etyrnyll (pronounced ""Eternal""). Finding him receptive to her advances, and far more bearable than Errrrrrrrl, she courted him and soon the two were expecting a child.

Deyrikklynne was aghast when Elyxandaireh told her that she wanted to name her child ""Finn"". For the rest of the pregnancy the entire household had to listen to Deyrikklynne ranting about it; ""The worst name I've ever heard in my life!"", ""How will the child ever fit in with a name like THAT?"", ""Not even a single 'y' in it!"". But Elyxandaireh stood her ground and refused to compromise. So imagine her shock and anger when, mere hours after giving birth, she discovered that her mother had filled out the birth certificate with the name ""Fynliilyndyn"". A fight ensued in which Elyxandaireh demanded to know ""Did you do this on purpose or did you spill alphabet soup on it?"" And Deyrikklynne whined that ""it's still pronounced ""Finn"" - the other letters are silent!"".

That was the end. After ""the naming incident"", the two grew to resent each other more and more. Elyxandaireh resented her mother for always bulldozing her way into her life, and she detested the way that the other housemates acted like it was all normal. Deyrikklynne thought her daughter was a selfish ungrateful brat, and that by trying to keep Fynliilyndyn out of the public eye she was dooming her to failure. The more Elyxandaireh tried to keep Fynliilyndyn away from the cameras, the more Deyrikklynne fought against her claiming that it was abuse to prevent her grandchild from gaining life-saving fame.

The fights got even worse after Goopy died trying to fix the cursed coffee machine which had taken so many lives before his. Without her steadfast fan to soothe her, Deyrikklynne started becoming more and more demanding. It became impossible to deal with her, she would never listen even to those who were taking her side. Eventually Elyxandaireh allowed Fynliilyndyn to make her own choice regarding fame and being filmed, to which Fynliilyndyn replied that she just wanted to live like everyone else, no more hiding. But even after the initial point of contention had been resolved, Deyrikklynne didn't calm down. She eventually died of a cardiac implosion while making yet another angry rant video. With her death, the remaining housemates decided to take back the winner's suite, and re-open the luxury floor to all housemates instead of only those who were parents.

Elyxandaireh fell into a depression, full of mixed feelings and strong guilt. She locked herself away and painted all day, unable to bear watching her children happily living in front of a camera 24/7. She neglected herself and eventually starved to death, despite being only a few steps away from the kitchen.

1g5jdfa,https://i.redd.it/rksxeo2629vd1.jpeg,Quicker recovery from relapses,"Hi gentlemen,
I have discovered SR in Feb-March this year and have seriously been on it since mid of April. I had streaks of 1 months and my highest being 80+ something. 
The point here is not the “streak” but how I used this streak to discipline myself with good habits. 

I have started to gym regularly 4-5 days a week, fast and play sport on weekend, mostly cut down outside food(everything I eat is mostly prepared by myself at home or a whole food), fully cut down sugar(I do cheat very occasionally lol), minimise coffee -as it ruins my digestive system, cold showers every single day, sungazing and so on.

From my understanding SR complements these habits and also VICE-VERSA. 
As soon as I relapsed after my longest streak, I got back up like nothing happened, that shame and guilt I use to have when I started SR were gone. Why? Because you have this whole abundance of good habits(read self development) which you can look back onto and know what you are capable of- now this doesn’t you can keep relapsing until you feel the shame haha. 

Now, although I have inculcated a good number of habits into my daily routine, I am still greedy for more- SR fuels your hunger for self- discipline, because it opens up your eyes(no pun intended) and shows u the ample opportunities. I did LSD few days ago and realised I felt the 50x amount of consciousness as on a long SR streak, but also realised at the same time I didnt need it because I can achieve that state without an external entity, I can simply do it with my semen, with what GOD has blessed me with.

**Karanveer** - Calculative and Competitive. i think his eyes are only on the Trophy. In Live feed, he was asking others about ""bahar main kaisa dikhta honga"" ""trophy main hi jeetunga"" ""yeh season kaise dikhega"" etc. Also, he keeps reminding people that Vivian is Colors ka ladla constantly.

i think Karanveer keeps nominating Sara bcoz he wants to remove one of the couple. Not bcoz of the reasons he is giving. Also, it looks like he wanted Sara to create some friction or masala with him after he took her name but Sara didnt bother. So, he nominated her again. All this makes him look little fake and trying to push some narrative. He is also talking about how the show will get more fights if weaker ones are removed etc. He is always thinking about all this and not going with the flow.

**Avinash** - Batameez and Psycho vibes. He chose ration not bcoz he cared about the housemates. He chose it bcoz he is the biggest Bhukkad in the house jo 4 Aloo k liye hungama kar sakta hai, coffee chupa sakta hai. Cake bhi khud khaane k liye maang raha hoga. i dont like the way he kept targeting Shilpa ji. Jo bhi hai content de raha hai par. He will used by Bigg Boss but may not win it.

**Rajat Dalal** - loud and irritating tone hai iska. Par Tez  hai. He brought the topic of eliminating Avinash and twisted the whole game. He knew that Avinash will create problems if he gets control of Ration, yeh bhi samajh gaya ki woh Psycho hai.  It was funny how he asked for Fevikwik for his kachua lmao

**Arfeen** -  His reasons for nominating has been logical so far. He has been a constant point of discussion even if he is not any known TV star like others

**Chahat** - same like Arfeen, whether you like her or not. she has always been a point of discussion since start. Directly or indirectly. She always looks like a dukhi aatma, so needs to start smiling more.

**Eisha** - she seems to be in love with Avinash and it will be interesting to see the dynamics of the trio if that happens

**Chum** - after yesterday's outburst, Chum got noticed more. She gave it back to Avinash. Until then, it looked like she was quiet. So, she shud continue voicing her opinions strongly

1g5j92p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgencyGrowthHacks/comments/1g5j92p/building_a_strong_company_culture_in_a/,Building a Strong Company Culture in a Remote/Hybrid Work Environment,"Building a strong company culture in a remote or hybrid setting can be challenging but achievable with the right focus on connection, communication, and flexibility. Here’s how you can create a solid culture that thrives in these environments:

**1. Define Your Core Values Clearly**

In any setting, but especially remote, it’s essential that your core values are well-defined and communicated. These values should be reflected in every aspect of the company—hiring, project management, and employee interactions. Make sure every team member understands what the company stands for and aligns with it, no matter where they’re working.

**Tip**: Regularly revisit your values with the team during meetings or via internal newsletters to keep them top of mind.

**2. Prioritize Communication and Transparency**

One of the biggest challenges of remote work is the risk of poor communication. To combat this, use multiple channels (like Slack, Teams, or email) and encourage regular check-ins to ensure everyone stays aligned. Transparency is also key—share updates about company goals, challenges, and successes openly to maintain trust and keep everyone connected to the bigger picture.

**Tip**: Weekly or biweekly all-hands meetings are a great way to ensure transparency and allow everyone to feel included, even from afar.

**3. Encourage Social Interaction**

Social interactions naturally happen in an office, but in a remote or hybrid environment, you have to be more intentional about creating those moments. Organize virtual coffee breaks, team lunches, or game sessions where employees can chat and bond outside of work-related topics. This helps maintain personal connections and strengthens the sense of belonging.

Example: Schedule a 15-minute ""watercooler"" chat each week where team members can drop in and just hang out casually.

**4. Recognize and Celebrate Achievements**

Recognition goes a long way in fostering a positive work culture. Whether it’s a shout-out in a team meeting or a personalized message of thanks, celebrating wins—big or small—makes employees feel valued. Recognition tools like Bonusly or even a simple Slack channel dedicated to shout-outs can be highly effective in building morale remotely.

**5. Emphasize Flexibility and Work-Life Balance**

Remote and hybrid work offers more flexibility, but it’s important to manage it properly. Encourage employees to set boundaries and take time off when needed. Creating a culture where employees feel comfortable balancing work and personal life can prevent burnout and increase job satisfaction.

**Tip**: Offer flexible working hours to accommodate different time zones or personal commitments, as long as team deadlines are met.

**6. Provide Opportunities for Growth**

Remote workers still want to feel like they’re growing in their careers. Offer online training, mentorship programs, and career development plans to keep employees engaged and moving forward. A company that invests in its people will foster loyalty and a stronger sense of culture, even from a distance.

**Tip**: Host monthly virtual workshops or training sessions to help team members enhance their skills and feel like they’re progressing.

**7. Build a Feedback Loop**

A healthy culture requires open lines for feedback. Encourage employees to share their thoughts about the company culture, processes, or projects, and act on that feedback where possible. Having regular 1:1s or anonymous surveys helps employees feel heard and valued.

**Example**: Use tools like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to conduct regular culture surveys, ensuring the work environment remains positive and productive.

**8. Leverage Technology for Collaboration**

Utilize collaboration tools to keep everyone in sync. Project management platforms like Trello, Asana, or Notion can help maintain transparency on ongoing projects, while communication tools like Zoom and Slack foster daily interaction.

**Tip**: Implement “virtual office hours” or drop-in sessions where employees can ask questions or collaborate in real-time, just like they would in a physical office.

Building a strong company culture in a remote or hybrid environment takes deliberate effort. By fostering open communication, celebrating achievements, and prioritizing employee well-being, you can create a connected, engaged, and motivated team—no matter where they’re located.

For too many years I would walk past a cute lady who would hold eye contact and maybe flash me a smile, as I would keep walking and say to myself 'damn she was cute... I hope I find her on hinge' 

Until I had an epiphany... what the hell am I thinking? I'm 6'5 good looking and personable, here is my chance to meet a cute lady but instead I'm doing my dating through some predatory greedy dating apps with women who I might not even be attracted to? 

As someone who doesn't enjoy bars and clubs, never meets anyone at work, has solo or male dominated hobbies and whose friends never go out anymore, meeting women whilst out and about during the day is literally the best chance I've got. 

So I've approached a few, got a few rejections (which weren't as bad a I had imagined) and had 2 dates (turned out we weren't really compatible but it wasn't bad). 

I tell myself that even if they aren't interested most women should actually be flattered being approached by a respectful guy and if they're uncomfortable for 20 seconds, well, it's a small price to pay for a potential lifelong relationship.

I've been pretty direct with it -  *hey this is a long shot but life's short, you're cute and have a friendly vibe so if by some chance you're single and you're interested I would love to get to know you over a coffee sometime.* Or something like that.

If there is a natural conversation starter I'll take that but often if you're just walking past someone at the mall, there isn't. 

And sometimes trying to make small talk can come across as annoying or creepy when it's obvious what you're getting at. 

But I'm still not sure about the best way to connect or what exactly to say. 

Any advice?

This is not a cohesive storyline, but rather scenes that I made up in my head.

--------


Scene: The flight deck of the Liberator. The lighting is darkened. Blake is sitting on the edge of a table underneath the Zen dislay. Cally walks in.

Cally: Dreams again?

Blake: Yes. And I have a headache.

Cally: Have you been to the Medibay?

Blake: Numerous times. It says my condition can't be fixed due to ""neurological damage"".

Cally: (sighs, looks away) Bastards.

Blake: And you're awake because...?

Cally: (Looks back at Blake) Too much coffee.

Blake: (smiles) (changes topic) Do you feel up to a crew review?

Cally: Is that what you're calling it?

Blake: I don't know what to call it. But you know what I'm talking about.

Cally: (smiles wistfully and nods).

Blake: Jenna.

Cally: She trusts you. She respects Avon. She is fed up with Vila. She ignores Gan. She is wary of me. She is thrilled to be piloting the Liberator. She's not sure if she should commit herself to your crusade against the Federation. You will lose her trust if you make bad decisions or lie to her. In fact lying is one of the things she is most disgusted about in people.

Blake: Hmmm. Interesting. Vila.

Cally: Vila doesn't trust anyone. (smiles) He likes Jenna and me because we're women but isn't likely to make any moves on us just yet. His humour is his way of coping with anxiety. He knows he is a brilliant thief and that's where his confidence lies. He feels inferior to you and Avon. He's not sure if he can last on board the ship because he can't please anyone.

Blake: Gan.

Cally: Gan is a concern. His limiter genuinely prevents him from going physically berserk. He is angered easily and finds it very easy to jump to conclusions.

Blake: (furrows brow) That doesn't sound like Gan.

Cally: It's the limiter that's doing this. He's been forced to cope with it by keeping his anger below the surface and exploring new ways to relate to people.

Blake: But he's not free Cally.

Cally: I'm not making any judgement either way. All I can say is that the limiter has helped him to be a better person. At least for the moment.

Blake: And his relationships?

Cally: He's too confused for me to read, although I'm sure he respects and likes you.

Blake: Well that's good. Now. (pauses) Avon.

Cally: (laughs) Ah yes. Avon.

Blake: (smiles) This should be good.

Cally: Avon respects Vila's talent, but hates him for wasting time. He has no time for Gan and is treating his limiter problem as an intellectual exercise. He respects Jenna as a pilot, in fact his respect for her has grown the more he understands what she does. But he is concerned about her motives. He respects you as a leader but has no desire to be one of your followers.

Blake: (laughs) Everyone knows that.

Cally: He also doesn't think the intellectual basis of your ideology is sound. I know this because he said that to me a few days ago.

Blake: Fair enough.

Cally: (looks worried). It is Avon's relationship with me that worries me.

Blake: How so?

Cally: Everyone here on the Liberator knows that I am an empath, and everyone is wary about this. Avon's response to me, though, indicates some level of knowledge.

Blake: What do you mean?

Cally: He is very careful in what he says or does around me. He deliberately avoids certain lines of conversation, even words. And he's been getting better at it too, which means he's learned about Auronic psychic talents from somewhere. And there's something else.

Blake: What?

Cally: A small part of Avon is dead. That's the only way I can explain it. If I focus my psychic abilities on, say, a rock, it is very clearly not living. There's a part of Avon that is like that.

Blake: I remember Vila saying that beneath Avon's cold exterior lies a heart of pure ice.

Cally: Vila is good with words sometimes.

Blake: Okay. (pauses theatrically) And now what about Blake?

Cally: (pauses). Blake is scared but committed. He moves from exultation at the potential of the Liberator to despair at not getting his way. He is mercenary in how he views the crew, Jenna is indispensible because she can pilot the ship. Vila is indispensible because of his talents as a thief. Gan might not be useful at all. He marvels at Avon's skills and yet wishes he could murder him.

Blake: Hmmm.

Cally: And of course he finds Cally indispensible for her psychic ability, including her skills in small unit combat.

(pause)

Cally: And also. You know. (shrugs shoulders)

Blake: (quietly) And Cally?

Cally: (pause) Cally finds Blake indispensible. And always has. (tears up).

Blake: (nods sadly) I know.

(Cally gets up and walks away)

---------------

Scene: Scorpio base kitchen. Dayna has made a cake and is smiling. Tarrant and Soolin walk in.

Dayna: What do you think? (Shows them cake).

Tarrant: It looks beautiful.

Dayna: Do you think he'll like it?

Tarrant: I think he will. He'll be up shortly.

Dayna: (places cake on table, grins) It's these times I love the most.

Tarrant: I agree, but it's not like we have a choice is there?

Dayna: How are you feeling Soolin?

Soolin: (blank) I am feeling happy.

Dayna: There we go. See?

(The door opens and Dorian walks in)

Dayna and Tarrant: Hooray! (claps)

Dorian: Hello everyone. What's this? A cake? Looks beautiful. (takes a piece and eats) Yes very nice.

Tarrant: How was the basement?

Dorian: (in between bites) Good. Very good. I feel like a new man.

Tarrant: Yes you do.

Dayna: It's such a pity it wears off.

Dorian: Well let's make the most of it then. Tarrant?

Tarrant? Yes.

Dorian: Were you able to talk to any of your contacts?

Tarrant: Yes as a matter of fact I was.

Dorian: Well let's have it.

Tarrant: It seems that Blake has escaped from Cygnus Alpha on board an alien space ship that he calls the Liberator.

Dorian: An alien ship you say?

Tarrant: One of his crew is named Avon. Avon is known as a computer and electronics wizz and was sent to Cygnus Alpha because he stole a lot of money from the government.

Dorian: Ah yes I thought I remembered his name. Good work Tarrant. (Tarrant smiles) Do you have anything for me Dayna?

Dayna: Sorry. Only the cake.

Dorian: And Soolin do you have anything for me perchance?

Soolin: Servalan has freed a prisoner named Travis and given him a squadron of advanced pursuit ships to hunt down Blake.

(pause)

Tarrant: What? Not Commander Travis the war criminal?

Soolin: I don't know who he is.

---------------



Scene. A room inside the Liberator. A man is tied to a chair with a hood on. Blake and Cally walk in. Blake takes the hood off. It is Declan, Servalan's asistant.

Declan: Ah. Well.... hello.

Blake: Do you know where you are?

Declan: Well I know your face. You're Blake. And gathering from the strange look of the architecture around me, I suppose I must be on the Liberator.

Blake: (sits down) Good guess.

Declan: (looks at Cally) I don't know who you are. I'm at a loss as to how I got here. One moment I was in my bunk on the shuttle. Then there was a struggle. The next moment I'm here. 

Blake: Do you know why you're here?

Declan: Well. I suppose being the assistant to the Supreme Commander is likely to be the reason. Um. Are you going to kill me?

Cally: We don't know yet.

Declan: Well that's not a positive development. I take it then that you want information?

Blake: (to Cally) He is smart isn't he?

Declan: I do need to point out that torture isn't exactly reliable.

Cally: Oh this will be worse than torture.

Declan: I... what does that mean?

Blake: Cally here is from Auron. She has psychic abilities.

Declan (interested): Oh I have heard of this. There are some from Auron who have the ability to tell if someone is lying or not. I've always wondered if that was a fairy story.

Blake: It's actually much worse than that.

Declan: Oh.

Blake: It's not enough just to ask questions and see whether you're lying.

Cally: It's getting inside your head and extracting information that you're with-holding.

(Cally places her hands over Declan's head. Declan begins screaming.)

---------------------

Scene: The deck of the Liberator. Jenna is asleep in her chair. Avon enters.

Avon: Jenna!

(Jenna wakes up. Looks annoyed).

Avon: I've often heard that pilots need their sleep.

Jenna: True. (yawns).

Avon: I need to spend some time at the controls - get myself acquainted with how to fly the ship.

Jenna: Not at the moment. We're refueling. Zen, exterior scan.

(A view of the area outside of the Liberator. There is brown mist flying by).

Avon: Where are we?

Jenna: I found an uncharted Brown Dwarf. I decided to see if we can refuel there too. We're in the Chromosphere.

Avon: So we've stopped. I thought so. How is the refueling going?

Jenna: Just as quickly as a Red Dwarf.

Avon: The coronal mass collectors? Are they functioning well?

Jenna: So far yes.

Avon: Good.

Jenna: You know there are twice as many Brown Dwarfs in the galaxy as there are Red Dwarfs. Most of them haven't been charted yet. And then there's the possibility of rogue gas giants. There's twice as many of them again than Brown Dwarfs.

Avon: We can refuel much quicker at main sequence stars.

Jenna: Yes but all main sequence stars are charted and have a populated planet. If we need to lay low for a while, it would be handy to know where uncharted Brown Dwarfs and Gas Giants are.

Avon: (thinks) Yes. You're probably right. But I think we also would need our own charted space lanes.

Jenna: That would take time. The Liberator can certainly map its own lanes faster than anything the Federation has, but you're still talking about months of work.

Avon: The Federation Navy have their own secret lanes. Everyone knows that.

Jenna: (pointedly) Smugglers, however, have their own maps.

(Avon looks at Jenna)

Jenna: We could buy some smuggler charts.

Avon: (pauses) Do smugglers like gold?

Jenna: Oh yes.",1,1729140875.0,Blakes7,0,1.0,False

LIKE WHAT IF SHE THINKS IM ACTUALLY INTO HER LIKE THAT?! and look i get it im clingy, but i have two days off a week from work and i wanna spend at LEAST one of them with her (only natural i assume?!) one time she said i treat her like she’s my man and she doesn’t know how much that actually bothered me, but when she says things off hand she means them seriously i know that. and i guess im kind of insecure cause she admitted to saying that to her friends as well (that i think she’s my man or treat her as such) and it just kind of made me feel desperate. she doesn’t know this but when she told me that i wanted to take some space fr cause like bro am i tweaking?! we were both like this why is it one sided now? and lately im always insecure that she’s annoyed with me or just doesn’t want to hang out. she’ll do planned things with her other friends like go to the movies, arcades, fun food spots, and more STUFF WE USED TO DO. and i get it IM BUSY i work 5 days a week and i work ALL DAY, all we have time for is coffee and catching up and yes i see her a lot but it’s never planned out like those hangouts are. i mean fuck they go into the city, which i love doing :) and she doesn’t even invite me. now don’t get me wrong guys i have other friends and we do all those things too, but i always invite her. she’s not a bad person at all but just tell me if im being crazy.

I’ll add details to give context but I really just need some insight so I don’t feel stupid. he’s a musician, currently working on new music, so I understand he is busy. i’m totally fine not talking often as long as we are actually seeing each other in person. I guess maybe I thought it was or could be more, but i’m fine with being friends or even hooking up, just wish guys were upfront about those things

I (25F) met a guy (26M) after matching on Raya and then following him on IG. he messaged me on raya and then immediately DMed me on instagram. chatted, gave me his number, and we texted all day. he had a concert the next day here in LA so my friend and I went. he came out to meet me after the show (in front of his friends and fans) and then I left. he called an hr later and asked to hangout as he’d be staying up all night for a 5am flight. I went over, met his bestfriend, and then hung out and hooked up. He kept telling me how great the sex was, like literally couldn’t stop saying it, told me how he was shocked at how comfortable he was with me, we cuddled, I drove him to the airport.

he texted me inside “god what a lovely night, thank you for coming”. he had another show that night so I texted him good luck, and the next morning he told me he thought about me during a specific song. we texted the next 3 days and he kept saying he couldn’t wait to see me when he got home, couldn’t stop thinking about me, etc. I assumed he was busy (3 shows, 6 interviews, 1 other event) so I didn’t text him for 11 days while he was gone. 

he called me the day he got back (less than 12 hrs later) and asked to see me. (he was in my area, at a coffee shop reading his bible journal and thought about me). I was busy, so he called me back that night when I was home. he invited me over to his best friends’ house (who is even more famous) and I agreed to go see him. ended up at his apt and stayed the night. it was really sweet and intimate, and we talked about private things in our lives, cuddled and had sex a few times.  I was really feeling him be vulnerable and sweet. the next morning we left in a hurry (he had a meeting) and kissed goodbye a few times. I called him the next day and he said he’d be in the studio all day but would text me if he could see me that night. he never texted. He was gone for 4 days out of state for a premiere, and then another 4 days visiting with his dad and his dad’s friends for a concert/boys trip. I didn’t text all week, and hoped that since last time that worked and he called after, it would happen that way again. 

I decided to throw aside my ego and reach out. said “hii was just thinking about you, how’s the trip going? :) “ and he responded IMMEDIATELY. like I didn’t even leave the chat yet. and said it was really good, and sent me 8 photos. he has never sent photos before, and these were photos that won’t be posted anywhere. very much son/dad weekend pics, and it felt really nice and personal. he sent another pic of him face down falling asleep saying he’s exhausted, so I responded being witty/flirty and then he did. I texted back 2 hrs later because the message was hard to respond to.. and I said “let’s catch up after you’ve had some rest” and he hasn’t texted back since. I mean since the week we first met, we haven’t texted much, so it’s hard to assume anything here, but he’s been the one to call me 5 times and i’ve only called that 1 time. it feels like shit to be strung along and sent private/family photos and see him act all excited to hear from me, just to not reach out again. we’re both back in town and he hasn’t contacted me this week. i’m really sad, not surprised, but disappointed.

I also work in the entertainment industry so I don’t give a damn about the fame, followers, etc. I just really liked him and our potential. why would he talk about going on dates with me, call me mid-day, and send those pics if he wasn’t interested? :/

1g5izka,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g5izka/sticky_situation/,Sticky situation?,"Hey, Reddit! I'm in a bit of an unusual pickle. I'm gonna try to keep it short but I'm sure it will still be a read, so a big thanks to anyone who sticks around. Backstory: in early 2023 I (28F) briefly dated a guy, Henry (31M), who I thought was amazing, so cute, so smart, so fun, etc., but when he told me he was deploying overseas for 2 years I was totally honest with him that I just did this in my previous relationship and I wasn't ready to do it again so sorry, no. (Every time I tell this story people suggest Henry is a catfish, so to extra-clarify, we were seeing each other in real life.)

A few months later I was still thinking about him so I reached out, he replied, we got to talking. That was June 2023, and we still talk almost every day. Now that he's confirmed he's returning to my area in a few months we've both been more openly flirty, he's very sweet but doesn't lay it on too thick, and he even mentions doing stuff together that's in the fairly distant future. I don't think I would say I'm in love with Henry ""just yet"" but I definitely have feelings for him. The general vibe of our conversations paired with some more specific things he has said tells me we're on the same page about it. He just makes me smile.

This is all well and good because I haven't really cared to do any online dating recently, I work a lot and I'm also disabled so it's always a huge production, at least for me, that usually ends in disappointment anyway.

The other day, one of my friends brought her coworker, Robert (27M), to a party our mutual friend was having (not as a date). She has previously spoken  highly of Robert, and I thought he was kind of cute. When I talked to him it was in a group conversation setting, but I must have said something right because she called me the next day and said Robert asked her to arrange another get-together because he wanted to see me again. I was surprised but I said, sure. What harm can some friends getting together do?

Friend dropped the ball making plans. Well, I saw that Robert followed me on Instagram a few days ago, so I followed him back. He messaged me tonight saying it's unfortunate the group plans fell through, but would I still be interested in getting coffee with him this weekend?

I'm sure I'm overthinking/overcomplicating this, but I don't have much dating experience so this is a new one for me. I liked Robert well enough at the party, and what harm can one date really do? Henry and I are technically not together, so it's not like I'd be slighting him by doing this. For all I know, he is too. (For the record, I do not think he is; Henry is a crazy shy nerd who has, probably emboldened by the keyboard, said some very sweet things to me.) All this to say, I don't know if it's really fair to give Robert the impression that I am in fact interested. Additionally, the aforementioned disability means he would have to drive over from the next state where he lives to see me -- it's not a suuuuuuper long drive but it's not exactly short, and it kind of seems like adding insult to injury.

I think I should just be about 80% honest with Robert; no reason to go into the Henry situation but maybe I'll just tell him something like I enjoyed his company at the party and I'm by no means opposed to hanging out but due to life circumstances I don't know how I feel about seeing someone? Seemingly every decision I have made in my life has been the wrong one, which is why I turn to Reddit for some unbiased opinions and thoughts.",0,1729140250.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False
1g5iys8,https://www.reddit.com/r/sabrinateenagewitch/comments/1g5iys8/please_help_me_find_this_episode/,Please help me find this episode!,"I was around 7-9 when the show aired, I am 32 now. This has bothered me for years - i consider myself proficient in finding things on the internet. I've tried everything I can possibly think of apart from just sitting and rewatching the entire series, which is my next step if this post fails to yield results. 

I am thinking of an episode where something slimy, I wanna say orange jello? Is getting thrown at someone (i feel like it's either libby or val but I could be wrong). And sabrina dives in front of them and gets covered in whatever slimy substance it is. This takes place in front of the lockers at the high school. 

The part I do remember vividly is the shirt Sabrina is wearing. I have spent half my adult life searching for this episode and the corresponding shirt. The shirt is plaid, with a dark blue, yellow, and cream/white color scheme. Button up, more of a denim material than a flannel if memory serves. 

I want this shirt. I've wanted this shirt since I was 8 years old. I have attempted to deep dive and find this episode/shirt once a year for at least the last decade. I have read every episode synopsis on Wikipedia, checked niche Pinterest and Instagram accounts dedicated to the outfits in the show. Nothing. I know it exists i have such a clear picture in my mind. I can picture the way the slime or whatever looked as it was settling into the white parts of the plaid throughout the scene.

Here are some details about my expenses:

Accommodation:  

- In Europe, I mainly used Airbnb and Booking.com, but spent about 30% of my nights in hostels.  

- In Asia, I didn’t use Airbnb and relied more on Agoda, Booking.com, Trip.com, Couchsurfing, hostels, and guesthouses.

Airfare:  

- In Europe, I used Google Flights, Expedia, Skyscanner, and Trip.com.  

- In Asia, I preferred Kayak, Trip.com, and AirAsia (Trip.com often had better deals).  

Most of my round-trip tickets were covered using airline miles.

My budget covered various travel expenses. I enjoyed visiting museums in different countries, renting cars, or joining small group tours as part of my travel experiences. Coffee was mostly enjoyed at my accommodations, where I spent about 90% of my time sipping coffee.

For food, in Europe, I opted to buy groceries, bread, or instant meals to avoid high restaurant prices. In Southeast Asia, I indulged in local traditional dishes, with hearty lunches or dinners costing between $4 to $7.

Regarding health expenses, I purchased travel medical insurance to ensure I had access to necessary medical services abroad. Most hotels provided personal care items like toothpaste, mouthwash, soap, and shampoo. Miscellaneous expenses included restroom fees and fines, which were usually unexpected small costs.

As for mobile usage, I didn’t have a travel phone plan from the U.S. and typically bought local SIM cards. For example, in Moldova, a SIM card costs just $1.19 for 100 GB of data. I also enjoyed buying souvenirs in every country, often collecting memorabilia from museums or attraction tickets.

1g5iqz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1g5iqz2/mystery_stomach_illness/,Mystery stomach illness ,"Hey all! I’ve been to a few doctors and they haven’t been able to figure out what is wrong with me. This is definitely personal and may be a bit tmi, but I’m going to share anyway. Here are some facts. 

1. All they following symptoms started around the same time 
2. My daughter, son, and I got many of these shared symptoms around the same time. About a year ago. 
3. My wife has had these shared symptoms for about 3 years 
4. Stomach bloating
5. Consistent gas
6. stool a very light tan, bubbly consistency and sometimes will burn on the way out (not super significantly)
7. Stool can be very very smelly
8. Randomly now lactose intolerant even through I have the genetic variant that allows me persist with making lactase through adulthood 
9. Stomach pain, occasional sharp pains in my prostate, sharp pains along my urethra. These last 2 pains only will happen like a dozen or so times per day and only lasts a second or 2 each time. 
10. Urine smell is odorous. Smells like chicken. And can smell way worse when drinking coffee. Same with my wife. 
11. My wife had a ct scan today which revealed no abnormalities 
12. Stool samples showed that the following were negative: Campylobacter species, C. difficile toxin, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella species, Vibrio species, Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia species, Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), (EPEC), (ETEC), Shiga toxin producing E. coli, Shigella/Enteroinvasive E. coli, Cryptosporidium species, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia, Adenovirus F40/41, Astrovirus, Norovirus GI/GII, Rotavirus Ag F, Sapovirus. 
13. A separate H pylori test was done and came back negative.
14. I took nitazoxanide as we assumed it could have been parasites. I was able to take this as recommended for a few weeks. My issues started to clear up a lot but I had to stop due to the mental side effects it was causing me. 
15. I stated taking 8 drops of oil of oregano 3x daily for about 4 weeks. This helped my symptoms tremendously but I couldn’t stay in it forever because I didn’t want it to ruin my gut biome. So I stopped taking it and now all the symptoms are back.  
16. Both my wife and my daughter have had strange things in their stool. Each had 1 work like thing in their stool that measured about 6 inches long. The doctors said they tested it and said that it was inconclusive if it was a worm or not and said it’s likely mucus. Well, it looked more like a worm (white in color) to me and it was able to be put into a ziplock bag without falling apart. 
17. We have not been out of the country 
18. This has been a persistent daily issue ever since it started
19. Drinking about 3-5 beers will help relieve the symptoms for about a day 
20. Sometimes I believe the issue with my gut causes my face to get flush and just have this sort of grain fog that only get relieved after drinking alcohol.
21. Can often cause diarrhea. But more often it’s the lighter fluffier type light tan stool. 
22. Additional symptoms that my wife is having includes now having severe food allergies to almost everything. There is very little she can eat that won’t severely upset her stomach and cause her to be laid up in bed because of eating it 
23. My wife tested positive for h pylori. The doctors then gave her antibiotics for that as well as giardia as they can be linked. She took it for the prescribed time and got retested for by pylori and it came back negative. But every single symptom she was having is still there. 

We suspect that it could be parasites, but the doctors just want to refer us to gi. Then gi wants to do scopes on both ends which is very intrusive in my opinion.

1g5inh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1g5inh1/a_letter_from_zaveri/,A letter from Zaveri,"The sun cast its golden rays over the opulent mansions of Badalandpur, illuminating the sprawling estate of the Bainchod family. Nestled among fragrant jasmine and vibrant marigold gardens, their lavish home stood as a testament to wealth and status. Twelve-year-old Bablu Bainchod sat cross-legged on the cool marble floor of the grand living room, his attention consumed by a thick book filled with tales of distant lands and mystical creatures. 

Despite the luxury surrounding him, Bablu often felt isolated within the gilded cage of expectations set by his affluent parents. His father, Mr. Bainchod, was a prominent businessman whose voice echoed through the corridors, demanding perfection and obedience. His mother, Mrs. Bainchod, was equally formidable, ruling the household with an iron fist cloaked in silk. 

As Bablu flipped through the pages, he was suddenly jolted from his reverie by a loud crash from the kitchen. His mother had dropped a tray of silverware while hurrying to answer the doorbell. 

“Bablu! Come here this instant!” she called, her voice sharp and authoritative.

Bablu jumped to his feet, leaving his book on the ornate coffee table, and rushed to the entrance. He found his mother standing there, an expression of disbelief on her face, holding a thick envelope sealed with crimson wax.

“What is it, Ma?” he asked, his heart racing with curiosity.

“This letter… it’s for you,” she said, handing it to him as if it were a dangerous object. The envelope felt heavy in his hands, and as he examined it, the elegant calligraphy of his name seemed to draw him in, promising a world beyond the confines of his current life.

“Open it!” Mr. Bainchod bellowed from the living room, his booming voice cutting through the tension like a knife. 

Bablu carefully peeled the wax seal and unfolded the letter. His eyes widened as he read aloud:

“Dear Bablu Bainchod,

We are delighted to inform you that you have been accepted into the prestigious Zaveri Institute of Mystical Studies, where you will embark on a journey to explore the extraordinary arts of magic and wisdom. Your training begins on the first day of the upcoming month. Enclosed, you will find a list of the materials needed for your classes.

Yours sincerely,
Professor Radhakrishnan, Headmaster”

Excitement surged through Bablu as he absorbed the words. A school for magic? This was incredible! But as he looked up at his parents, their expressions quickly extinguished his joy. 

“What is this nonsense?” Mr. Bainchod shouted, his face reddening. “Magic? You’re supposed to focus on your studies, preparing to take over the family business, not wasting your time on fantasies!”

“Baba, please listen!” Bablu pleaded, desperation creeping into his voice. “This is my chance to learn something extraordinary! I want to be more than just a name in your business.”

“Extraordinary? This is utter foolishness!” his father retorted, stepping closer, his imposing figure towering over Bablu. “You think you can throw away everything we’ve built for you? This letter is just a joke!”

“Baba, don’t do this!” Bablu cried, feeling the familiar sting of fear creep in. “I want to explore, to learn! Please let me have this chance!”

Mrs. Bainchod’s voice chimed in, laced with anxiety. “What will our neighbors think? Our son going to a magic school? It’s embarrassing! You’re a Bainchod; you must uphold our reputation!”

“Reputation?” Bablu scoffed, frustration bubbling over. “You’re more worried about what others think than what I want!”

The room fell silent, the air thick with tension. Bablu’s heart raced as he felt the anger rising in his father’s eyes. He had seen that look before—when he had made mistakes, when he had disappointed them. 

“Enough!” Mr. Bainchod shouted, his voice reverberating through the room. “You will not go anywhere! You are my son, and you will follow the path I’ve chosen for you.”

In that moment, Bablu felt the familiar dread settle in his stomach, a heavy weight that came with the threat of physical punishment. Memories flooded back of the times he had been slapped for disappointing his parents or scolded for minor infractions. But this time, something within him snapped. 

“I’m going to Zaveri! I don’t care what you say!” Bablu declared, his voice unwavering despite the fear that gripped him. 

His father’s eyes widened in disbelief, and Bablu could see the anger boiling beneath the surface. “You dare defy me?” Mr. Bainchod stepped forward, and Bablu braced himself, anticipating the swift sting of his father’s hand. But instead of cowering, he stood his ground, the letter clutched tightly in his fist.

“Go ahead, Baba! Hit me if you want, but I will not let you control my life!” Bablu shouted, the words spilling out in a rush of adrenaline. 

In that moment, the tension in the room shifted. His mother gasped, her hand flying to her mouth in shock, while his father’s face contorted in anger and disbelief. The fear of punishment had transformed into defiance, a refusal to be shackled by their expectations any longer.

As Mr. Bainchod took a step back, the weight of his son’s words hung heavy in the air. Bablu could see the internal struggle within him—caught between the traditional values of control and the realization that he was losing his son.

“Bablu, think about what you’re saying!” his mother urged, her voice trembling. “You will ruin your future!”

“Maybe my future is not what you want it to be!” he shot back, his heart racing with newfound courage. “Maybe I want something different!”

The night air outside was fragrant with the scent of blooming jasmine, and the stars began to twinkle overhead, igniting a sense of adventure that coursed through his veins. Bablu was ready to embrace his destiny, ready to discover who he was meant to be beyond the confines of Badalandpur.",1,1729138960.0,stories,0,1.0,False

He was a great person to work with as long as you submitted your work on time. He encouraged me to set up coffee chats to network/chat, and even offered to mentor me. (Everyone at the firm is assigned a mentor though, of course, you’re allowed to find another mentor if you wish)

Despite all of this, he is relatively moody. Depending on the day, he will engage in small talk. Other days, he won’t talk to anyone, and make brief tense remarks.
Because of this, I never set up those coffee chats and I only engaged in conversations just enough to get my work done.

Due to personal reasons, I departed from the firm. We didn’t speak for over 2 years. I eventually returned to my old job where he has been promoted to manager. Somehow he still remembers me! (This department has 300+ people, I’m very surprised)

Now that he’s manager, he has changed - at times rude and even yelling at staff. As a result, I am even more hesitant to interact with him. Ironically, he encouraged me to ask questions and seems calm when he talks to me.

I grew up in Milwaukee, so my ears don't feel cold wind chills.  The weather in Madison and four seasons will be welcome change.  Not only has this summer been very hot, it's been four months of exactly the same weather every day without even the thunderstorms and dust storms the Sonoran Desert is supposed to have.

I am hoping we can find a small house or half a duplex or an end unit or something with outdoor space where we can play fetch during lunch.  It doesn't have to be huge, but larger than a typical apartment patio.  I work from home, so I like to wear out my dog for the afternoon.  A complex with a dog run might be OK.  I would expect Madisonians to be more midwestern nice and to have more animal sense than people here.  I would probably go up to $2300/mo if it was perfect.  I only need 1BR, but I could  justify a second bedroom for an office.  I would be OK with mowing the grass.  It was my first job.

I like all kinds of cycling, so the ideal location would have city-type things like a grocery store or coffee shop in easy walking or riding distance in one direction and country roads or mountain bike trails in the other.

Are there any utility gotchas around Madison?  Like one part of town with a bad ISP or something?  Neighborhood with icky water?  In metro Phoenix, there are two electric utilities: SRP and APS.  People love SRP and hate APS.  (And all the water is undrinkable.)

SW:215, GW:140, 37 years old and 5'2"". I did my injection this morning as I wasn't sure what to expect as far as side effects and I didn't want to be alone or up all night the first time. I drank a protein shake for breakfast and got ready. I did the injection on my stomach and I'm happy to say it was super anti-climatic. It didn't hurt, I actually didn't feel it go in at all. Just conceptually it was a new and weird experience, but not bad. 

15 minutes in, the injection site had a tiny welt and it was a little itchy, but this subsided within the hour. By that time I was feeling a little tired and laid on my couch to watch TV. I fell asleep for 2 hours mid-movie and still felt pretty lethargic when I woke up around noon. I also felt a little sick. Like mild morning sickness where the thought of certain foods made me feel queasy, but I also felt like maybe something light would be good. I ate a pb&j sandwich and banana. I felt great immediately after but then the nausea returned within another 30 minutes. I felt like I over-ate and remained queasy when I thought of eating or smelling certain smells. Even watching tv with a lot of motion triggered the nauseated feeling. I found that light pressure felt good so I put on a compression wrap and all was good again until dinner. Around dinner time I wasn't very hungry and not a lot sounded good. I ate and again didn't feel very good after. I'm now laying in bed slightly on my stomach for the pressure and not feeling great. I'm surprised I'm experiencing everything I am so soon, but it's the only thing it could be and I'm hoping it gets better from here.

A few other ways I'd describe the nausea because this is what I wanted to know the most, would be the way you feel after a stomach bug. The days after when you aren't throwing up or having diarrhea anymore, but your stomach is still sensitive like you could get sick if you ate the wrong thing. After eating, even a small amount felt like too much. I also noticed myself burping a lot more throughout the day. Fluid intake was also more difficult than usual. Aside from the 13oz protein shake, I drank 1/2 cup of coffee vs. 1-3 cups, I drank about 8 oz. Of carbonated soda instead of 16 oz at dinner, and water I only drank about 24 oz. Instead of the 80-100 oz. I could normally get in a day. I just felt too full to finish or drink more and I didn't feel thirsty at all today.

today i had one after a really stressful month of not being able to sleep right, playing lots of videogames and always being on a screen. my schooling is online and so is a job hiring process that i have to keep an eye on and lots of doctors appointments.

i am stacked up on assignments and drank coffee last night and took melatonin as well as metrodazinole for a 7 day prescription.
that along with some really stressful situations that happened and have me overwhelmed and overthinking led me into a really bad stiff/catatonic/stuttering/heavy hyperventilating seizure with head and feet jerking. sometimes i fight them and i try to talk but this time it was just sounds and super stuttering. it lasted an hour (like 3 separate episodes) and i was alone. at one point i thought the hyperventilating was just an anxiety attack but this was worse and i forgot this is how my seizures used to be.

what is going on? i don’t want to tell anyone because they will freak out and then my job won’t hire me.

i did two years of rehab recently and had no problems. before those two years i had a couple seizures when i was on meth and living on the street and i was also alone. before that about 8 years before i had seizures for the first time on and off for two years.

i think my life became overwhelming again and i burned out so hard that circuits crossed hard. is this something i am just susceptible to for life because of my brain?

A year ago his “seizures” started. But all tests have come back normal. CT scan on the brain, MRI, they even put a camera through his heart. All clear. The first 4 pass out events he was alone. On the 5th one, our whole family witnessed it and it was horrifying. Eyes rolled back, tongue bit, full body convulsions, turned bright red, choked back to consciousness.. really confused and combative for about 20 minutes after. His neurologist said it’s not strokes or seizures.. but syncope. They saw a study that said it could be linked to the weed. Another said the caffeine could be causing it. He has since stopped smoking altogether and went down from about 8 big cups of coffee a day to 1-2. And he hasn’t had another full episode in the last 5ish months…

BUT 

he now frequently gets these bouts of aphasia where he suddenly seems to go dumb in the brain.. can’t answer any questions and doesn’t know what’s going on. He can talk, but it’s as if we are speaking a different language. It’s really disturbing and horrifying to my mother, his beloved of over 40 years. She says his extreme confusion usually lasts for about 5 minutes. He also regularly gets headaches.

Any ideas as to what it could be or what else to explore with his medical team? 

Alzheimer’s runs in our family (his mom) and so does dementia (his dad) but they didn’t see any degeneration or lesions in the brain on his scans.

I started my journey again on the 29th of July this year. I was 125.9kg and seriously considering gastric sleeve surgery. Financial issues led us to pause our health insurance for a few months, so my waiting periods were shifted. In the meantime, I decided to start on Duromine (my doctor had prescribed it a few months prior, but I was too scared to take it).

The first two months were great—I lost roughly 7kg on Duromine alone with no changes to what I was eating, just eating a lot less because of reduced appetite.

I went back to the doctor for a script, as they are only giving me a one-month supply at a time. The doctor said, *""You haven't lost much weight; you need to go on Optifast and start exercising.""* So, I did.

For a few weeks now, I’ve been using Optislim products:

* **Breakfast**: A shake around 10am
* **Lunch**: A bar around 1:30-2pm
* **During the day**: About 2 litres of water, black coffee, and green tea (no snacks at work)
* **Dinner**: A normal meal (not cutting carbs or sugar) with minimal snacking afterwards

I am now down to 115.9kg, roughly 2.5 months in.

Two days ago, I weighed in at 114.9kg—I was elated! I haven’t been under 115kg in at least five years. Then this morning, it changed back to 115.9kg, and I’ve been obsessing over it all day.

I’m so scared to put any weight back on. I really feel like this is my last chance to make it work, or it's surgery 100% next year. I’m scared.

I don’t know if going from 125.9kg to 114.9kg in about three months is enough. Is it good? Is it bad? I have no idea. All I know is I want the weight gone ASAP, but I’m also battling binge eating recovery.

I have ADHD and Autism, and in the past, I’ve struggled immensely with overeating as a way to seek dopamine.

I'm honestly feeling so sad and scared, and I don’t know what else to do. Should I switch to three Optislim meals a day and cut out all snacks? Should I incorporate intermittent fasting? What’s the healthiest way to do this?",1,1729138625.0,WeightLossAdvice,1,0.67,False

We met at a library where we both spend all our days studying and became quite close over the last 3 months. We started travelling and having most meals together and we always have a gala time hanging out. We share the same sense of humour so the breaks that we take together help us destress from the stresses of our work. She’s appearing for a competitive exam and I am enrolled in a very costly design program that demands minimum 10 hours of work everyday. I take on the role of the elder sister in the relationship and let her be a little carefree as I found that to be harmless initially. However I started noticing patterns of selfishness and how the friendship was slowly turning to be one sided. I would help her organise her daily time tables for study and help her calm down whenever she got overwhelmed and encouraged her to study more. She was also incredibly nice to me most of the time, bringing ice cream for me during pms and driving me home. But her emotional immaturity is slowly getting on my nerves. She has anger issues (got into a road rage), is into a ldr but questions her attraction towards her boyfriend every time she starts talking to a new guy, becomes extra bubbly and enthusiastic towards guys, and frequently cuts my sentences in both personal conversations and conversations with other people. She spent 5 days making a bday gift for her boyfriend and subsequently went on a movie with another guy friend spending half a day there. There’s a dance festival that happens only once a year here in India and when I urged her to come with me for one day for a mere 3 hours she told me that has to study. The very next day she asked me to come out with her as she was craving fries and coffee (we usually end up spending 2 hours if we got out). The garba dance night meant a lot to me and this imbecile has the audacity to ask me to go out with her when she cancelled my plan. She ended up coming late for two more days and since I know her schedule so well, I know she wasn’t studying. She and I also got into an argument about religion (she’s quite radical with her views) and she walked out on me after instigating the disagreement. Even though the friendship started on even terms it’s becoming more skewed over time, where she uses me for emotional support but doesn’t give it back. She comes to me for relationship problems but when I share my feelings about my traumatic past, she has nothing to say. I stopped talking to her after that incident and she hasn’t tried talking to me since. I feel like this is a good time to stop this behaviour and set a precedent for this friendship if it goes further, that I cannot tolerate such a skewed relationship. The rational part of me doesn’t stress over letting this go but there’s an anxious part of me that still wants the friendship without the fluff. I feel like I’m ruminating over this.

My Affair with Ceaser Romero in 1959
First in a biographical series retrospective of my life

1959 Miami Beach April I was working as a cocktail singer at the lounge at the Fountianbleau Hotel in Miami Beach, I finished my last show at 11pm , little did i know that Cesar Romero had seen my show, he came back to my dressing room and invited me to take a midnight drive .

I quickly freshened up and slipped into a black christian dior dress with red sling backs. Caesar drove his emerald green Cadillac Elder ado convertible and picked me up at the hotels entrance, I felt like a princess !!!! We drove out to a swampy area and he stopped the car.

He had brought along some rum and coke a cola and we drank our cocktails while leaning on the hood of the Cadillac watching the full moon shadowed by the palm and cypress trees.

He suddenly pulled me close to him and could see the intensity in his eyes. I could smell his bay rum cologne and felt the ""excitement"" building in his loins. I knew my moment of ecstasy was at hand.

I was strangely attracted yet hesitant about his advances so I broke our embrace and stepped back. I accidentally stepped into the swamp , a flamingo flew out of the brush and scared me, my sling back shoes got stuck in the mud. Caesar picked me up in his arms and placed me on the still warm hood of the Cadillac, the full moon shined behind him and I could not resist his advances, he slowly removed my dress luckily in those days I was slim and trim and I did not have to wear constricting foundation garments so dress removal was easy, he was gentle yet forceful. I do not remember much after that, however I did hit my head on the hood ornament at some point.

It seemed like hours but in reality our ecstasy lasted only 10 minutes, Cesar had a ""control"" isssue he drove me back to the Fountianbleau , we did not talk .

Contraception in those days was not very effective, a month later I found myself on a plane incognito flying to Cuba to go to a clinic in Havana for an ""operation"" The next time I saw Caesar was when he was on Batman. I will never regret our night of romantic ecstasy!!!
