That seems crazy expensive. That's like a full-on restaurant meal in a slightly expensive restaurant. For someone you've never met? I think most people don't even spend that much on a night out drinking. And then some people go on a few or several first dates per month, which would be like £200/month, which the average person can't afford. I was under the impression most people just get a coffee or similar.

For context, my father owns the land area (he's an architect), and he keeps delaying all the constructions because we haven't settled down on an agreement with how things will operate. I shouldered almost all of the construction costs and will also shoulder the equipments for the business. 

It pisses me off because he verbally said that the land area will be for me and my other brother. 
I despise it that he keeps on insisting that he is part of the team. 
P.S. My father has a second family now and that personal problem is one of the reasons why I am hesitant to include him on the team. 


Anyways, been thinking of giving him just a 5% share of the business, lately just for sake for the business to already start because I have already invested a lot of money, time, resources and effort in that cafe.

Hi everyone! My partner and I are travelling from Australia for a 2-week holiday in November, and we’d love your help with:
	1.	Suggestions on areas to stay in LA that are safe, well-located for our plans, and ideally a bit fun/interesting to explore with coffee shops and breakfast options (and budget friendly!)
	2.	Thoughts on our itinerary—what’s missing, what’s too much, and any cool hidden gems you recommend!

Here’s our rough plan so far:

Days 1–3: Anaheim for Disneyland
Days 4–5: Back in LA, no plans yet – open to ideas!
Day 6: Griffith Observatory + Warner Bros Studio Tour
Day 7: No plans
Days 8–9: Universal Studios
Day 10: Nothing booked yet
Day 11: Academy Museum of Motion Pictures + Santa Monica Pier
Day 12: Drive to Big Bear, stay the night
Day 13: Joshua Tree (any other stops we can do on the drive back to LA?)
Days 14–15: Back in LA, again no fixed plans

We’re not too interested in Hollywood Blvd or tourist traps, but we love film and theatre, and also want some chill time to wander around, sip matcha or coffee, browse bookstores and record shops, and soak up the vibe of different LA neighbourhoods.

Would love to hear your thoughts—thanks in advance! ",0,1746579199.0,AskLosAngeles,1,0.5,False

1kgkpq1,https://v.redd.it/ym3gf4acc9ze1,Anyone elses husky do this?,"So i have a female husky who gets a lot of exercise. We rent private fields, she runs with the bike, i use multiple secure leashes to extend her ability to roam on walks without having to let her off in public and we go EVERYWHERE you can think of. Paddocks, lakes, beaches, forests, parks, coffee shops, resturants, you name it, shes done it. Shes well adjusted in the short time weve had her and loves being outside and involves in things.

When we are walking pretty much anywhere tho she does this thing where she walks infront smelling, minding her own business and then pings directly verticle up in the air and then carries on walking. She will do this over and over again during the leashed walk, she sometimes adds a little flair to it but then walks on like it never happened. Admittedly cracks me up

Is this something others do? Is it because i give her a lot of freedom and i let her run a lot so when we are walking on the leash, she is bored and feels confined? Or is she just happy to be out and about?

I thought maybe she just wanted to ""go  go, go!"" But she acts like she didnt do anything. She pulls mildly to smell but walks pretty well, out in front considering where she came from but shes still being trained.

Our husky prior was a very quiet girl, she didnt really get hyped up or show much ""emotion"", its quite a difference between the two, she was hard as nails and independant and this newer girly is a bit goofy and soppy. 

Can anyone offer some insight in to her behaviour? Is this ingrained husky dna that makes her hyped up or is she frustrated and bored? As our other didnt do this nor do we see over huskies on walks doing this.

Side note - shes was adopted from a bad place in different country but prior to being caught, lived on the streets, we think shes 3yrs. 
We were told 5 but, shes very puppy like. 
Do you think maybe because she had so much freedom before being caught she doesnt like the lead holding her back? I have a video of her doing a mini jump but she usually does huge ones vertically. We had been out a while so she was slowing down a bit. Its typical the time i try to catch it on camera she puts the least amount of effort in to it but you catch my drift.

~~if you see this in the first hour and constant editing from spelling and formatting mistakes, no you didn’t~~

ACTUALLY FIRST, I was able to register at 9am yesterday and registration closed at 12pm. Mind you I was told registered closed on *April 27th

First, despite taking adderall and having an iced coffee, I fell asleep at 12pm.

~~I forgot to shave my legs in the shower this morning so I just put shaving cream and used a wash cloth to shave my legs~~
 
As one does after shaving their legs…
##I realize I lost my graduation cap and need to find it. 

The mission to find my graduation cap has begun. Three of my friends look through my newly cleaned room post adderall-induced cleanliness. Obviously it’s not in my room and I try to remember what I did on the day I last had it, but I never left my dorm >!spoiler alert, yes I did!<

We go to my friends room, then the maintenance staff who I’ve talked to casually to practice my Spanish sees us and gets emotional. I start yapping and tell her I lost my cap. She remembers she has one from my mentor from when I was a freshmen. He was the nicest person ever and of course because he’s an angel, he became very close with the maintenance staff who I’ve also gotten close to, so she has his grad cap. She took pictures of us and then now I had a cap to walk with BUT no stole. 

#But my friend reminded me where *my* cap could be

Less than 50 feet away from my dorm was a computer lab that I chose to do work at IMMEDIATELY following the grad photo shoot. I had my AirPods and my phone with me, so I just went there with nothing else. Because it’s so close, Google Maps didn’t pick up that I changed locations (yes I’ve used Google maps timeline to retrace my steps.) 

I’m a resident assistant and I ask my residents to look for my cap for me (and I’d buy them a full course meal). One of my students found it and I sent him $60 for getting me my actual grad cap FIVE MINUTES BEFORE WE STARTED WALKING TO THE GRAD CEREMONY. 

But that’s not all. Here’s rapid fire what happened after 

* I took my (thesis) advisor to get snacks, and used my ID to pay for it through a meal swipe. 
* Between leaving the cafe and returning to my dorm, **I lost my ID that has access to all the dorms on campus**
*I’ve retraced my exact path twice and asked the cafe. It is a very short and memorable path. 

So now, it is evening. I’ve found my grad cap which I’ve previously lost by chance. My best friend forced me to take a picture of my neatly packed regalia in my room as receipt of putting it away.  Now I’ve since lost my ID. 
Get this: >!my friend used my ID and placed it a very specific spot where I can get my ID. My boss saw my ID and handed it to me. By interrupting my ornate plan to get my ID (that’s worked before) and having my boss return my ID to my physical possession, I ended up losing my ID.!<

She's either the second or third account that interacts with me the most. She likes almost all of my stories. I was on vacation this week, made a few stories and a post, but she doesn't seem to like my stories anymore. This makes her feel even more distant, and I know that someday soon she'll disappear forever back to Ukraine. I'm kind of sad, but I just had to say it to someone. Sorry for this rant.

I thought I would put myself out there and hopefully meet someone.

I am a very mature for my age 23 year old. I was born and raised in IL on a small one acre farm in a little farmhouse where I currently still live. I've had a pretty quiet life and lately I've been enjoying the simple things in life the most. It just gets a little lonesome at times. 

I am looking for a person 18+ who would be interested in forming a genuine connection and friendship and possibly something more intimate and flirtatious if we get comfortable. It's been a few years since I've had anyone to flirt with or where we both had a situation where we were comfortable sharing intimacy and I would love to find that again. One of the biggest things I'm attracted to physically are soft thighs, especially when I'm cold and need warmth. 🤣

I work full time during the week as a building maintenance tech at a tech corporation and I rather enjoy my job. I have weekends off. When I'm not at work, I'm typically relaxing at home. The only downside to my job is that my only coworkers are three men, and I don't get to meet people very easily because of working the off shift. 

Some of my interests are photography, nature walks, bird photography and wildlife, camping, cooking and baking, listening to music, the outdoors, relaxing and being comfy, aviation and flight simulation, technical stuff, fixing things and being handy, going to cute thrift shops and coffee shops, and animals. My favorite season is the Autumn and I absolutely can't wait for it. I could live in a tiny cabin in the woods with a wood stove or wood burning fireplace and be happy. 🤣🍁🏠 I'm a very peaceful person and quite the homebody. 

I am a pretty well rounded person and I'm always respectful and kind. I'll always be mindful of your feelings and boundaries, especially with anything more intimate as it's important to me. 

Physically I'm average healthy weight, pale skin, brown hair, wears glasses.

I'm currently just relaxing in bed after since it's my day off haha. If I seem like someone you'd like to connect with, then I'd love to hear from you!

##⁤ Key Features Analysis

The ⁤ideal 40 oz water bottle that ‍fits in ‌a cup holder boasts several key features⁢ that enhance⁤ it's functionality‌ and user experience.**Dimensions and Compatibility:**⁢ The primary factor is the base diameter‍ of the bottle. A bottle designed to fit standard cup ⁣holders typically has a base diameter of 3 inches or ‍less.The overall height is also crucial, as excessively tall bottles ⁤can be unstable‌ in certain​ cup holders. Some models feature a tapered design,wider ⁣at the ‌top and narrower at the base,optimizing​ the capacity while maintaining cup ‌holder compatibility.

The ‌specific dimensions of ⁢the bottle are crucial for​ ensuring it fits into most standard⁢ car, gym, and office cup holders.​ A base‌ diameter of around⁤ 2.75 to 3 inches‍ is generally considered optimal. Height should​ ideally be under 12 inches, although some taller bottles with narrow bases can still work well.

**Material and Insulation:** Most high-quality⁤ 40 oz water bottles are made⁢ from stainless steel,frequently enough with double-walled ⁤vacuum insulation.⁣ Stainless steel is durable, resistant to corrosion, and doesn't ⁤impart any flavor to the water. Double-walled vacuum insulation⁣ keeps the water cold​ (or hot) for extended periods, typically 12-24 hours.

The use ⁣of 18/8 ⁢(304) stainless‍ steel is⁣ common due to ⁢its durability, corrosion ⁤resistance, ‌and⁢ food-grade‍ safety.Double-walled vacuum insulation technology⁣ creates an airless space between the inner ​and outer walls, ⁢minimizing temperature transfer. This ensures that cold drinks stay cold for up​ to 24 hours and hot drinks stay hot for ‌up to 12 hours.**Lid Design⁣ and Functionality:** the⁤ lid is ‌an essential component,impacting usability and leak-proof performance. Common ‌lid types include screw-on lids,‍ flip-top lids, and straw lids. ​Some lids also feature a carrying handle or⁢ loop for added convenience. A well-designed lid should be easy to open and close,provide​ a secure seal to prevent leaks,and be comfortable to drink from.

screw-on lids are generally considered ⁤the most leak-proof option due to their tight seal. Flip-top lids offer convenient⁤ one-handed operation, while straw lids​ allow⁤ for easy sipping without tilting the bottle.‌ Many ⁤lids are also BPA-free to ensure they don't ‌leach harmful‌ chemicals ‍into the​ water.

**Durability and Construction:**‌ A durable water bottle should withstand everyday wear and tear, including accidental drops and ⁣bumps.‌ High-quality ⁤stainless steel construction contributes to durability, ​and some bottles feature ⁢a powder-coated finish for added ⁣scratch resistance and grip. reinforcements around the⁤ base and lid can also enhance durability.

The thickness of the stainless steel is a‌ key factor in determining durability. Thicker steel is more resistant to dents and damage. Powder coating not only provides a more durable finish⁣ but also improves grip, making the bottle easier ‍to ​hold, especially when wet.

**Ease ⁤of Cleaning:** A water bottle that is easy to clean is essential for maintaining hygiene and preventing the buildup of ​bacteria​ and ‌odors. Wide-mouth openings make it easier ‌to access⁣ the interior⁢ for​ cleaning,and dishwasher-safe components ​are‍ a ‌plus.Some bottles also feature removable parts ​for ⁢thorough cleaning.

Wide-mouth designs‍ allow​ for easy ‍scrubbing with ‍a bottle ⁤brush. Dishwasher-safe components, including the ⁣lid and any accompanying⁣ straws, simplify the cleaning process. Some models also offer specialized cleaning ‍tablets or brushes designed ⁣for water bottles.

Key‍ features​ of 40 oz water bottles⁢ that fit in ⁤cup holders include:

*   Compatibility with​ standard cup holders.*   Durable stainless steel construction.*   ‌Double-walled⁣ vacuum insulation.
*   Leak-proof lid design.* ‌  Easy-to-clean components.

**Enhanced hydration on the ​Go:** The primary benefit is the ability to stay adequately hydrated while on the move. having​ a 40 oz ⁤capacity means you can ​carry ⁢a ample amount ‌of water, reducing the need⁤ for⁤ frequent refills, especially during long ⁢commutes, workouts, or outdoor activities. This ensures ‍you⁢ can maintain optimal hydration levels throughout ​the day, supporting energy levels, cognitive function, and ⁤overall health.

Instead of relying ⁤on​ smaller bottles or disposable cups that require constant refilling, a 40​ oz ⁣bottle provides a ⁢convenient and sustainable solution. Whether you're ⁢driving, at‍ the gym, or hiking, you can have a large supply of water readily available. This⁣ proactive approach ‍to hydration can definitely ⁣help prevent dehydration-related symptoms such⁤ as headaches, fatigue, and decreased performance.

**Convenient Portability:**‍ The cup holder compatibility⁢ is a game-changer, especially for those who spend a lot of‍ time in their cars.

1kgkl8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kgkl8z/two_girls_two_different_sets_of_boundaries/,Two girls. Two different sets of boundaries.,"For the purpose of this story, all 3 of us are between 28-30 years old.  I'm male, and the two girls are, well, girls.  

I've been working for this company for 2 years and am unfortunately a bus rider, but luckily enough I'm not the only person from my work who buses, so I often have someone to ride the bus with and chat with, which is always welcome.

For the first year I lived in place A and took bus A to and from work.  When a girl at work - we'll call her **Apple** (not her real name) found out I took the same bus, just a half hour earlier, she insisted I take the later bus with her, which would get me to work on time instead of half an hour early.  I'm new to the company and want to make friends since I know I'll be there a while, so I do.  We start talking the bus.  We get to know each other.  She's nice.  But her boundaries are well, not awesome.  But back then I didn't really catch on because I've got my own attachment issues so some red flags aren't immediately flashing red to me.

She puts her number in my phone, which is fine - we're coworkers.  But then starts texting me.  A lot.  Everything.  Every little thought.  Sometimes paragraphs about nothing or some thing that happened to her that day.  At all hours - 6am on a Sunday type hours.  Comes up to me multiple times at work just to chat about random things.  Admittedly I didn't tell her off.  I reinforced her thoughts and validated her opinions - not overly so, but I was supportive because she seemed nice.  I'm pretty sure she cyber stalked me to an extent because she seemed to know things about me that I hadn't told her- such as my sibling being trans which she would have only known had she taken a deep dive into my social media.  But I digress.

She starts following me to my usual after-work coffee and snack place - every single day which is kind of out of her way getting home.  Once again, my fault for indulging her but I have no idea how to say no to someone like her who I have to see every day. We're coworkers and also it felt nice to have an objectively pretty (and seemingly harmless) girl's attention after kind of being a recluse for the previous 2 years before I got hired at this place.  Pretty soon I'm overwhelmed.  Even I, someone with a near non-existent sense for these things, want her to leave me alone.  But I can't tell her off.  We're friends, right?  That'd be awkward.

This goes on for a year.  At first I was happy for the attention, and then I realized this is not normal.

Funnily enough in all this time I don't think she ever asked me something about myself or how I feel about something.  Also she has anxious attachment issues (by her own admission) so I'm careful with how I word things with her because she's weaponized her anxiety against me multiple times to guilt trip me after I tried to set some boundaries, but that came later and I won't get into it.  Long story short I found a way to softly convey that I wanted her to leave me alone, and now we don't speak at all.  It's a relief, but she still after all this time makes a point to guilt trip me whenever possible, both directly and passive aggressively.

Any time I've ever tried to address this with her because she is clearly all bent out of shape at work, she stonewalls me, which just adds to how annoying this has been for so long.

______________________________________________________________________

Eventually, about a year into working there, I move to a new place and am now taking bus B to/from work, now with a different girl I work with - we'll call her **Peach.**  We take the bus together after work, but not before work because she likes to get to work early so she takes the earlier bus.  She has never once taken the later bus 'just to hang out for a bit'.  If I no longer took that bus she'd be just fine, and I respect that. 

Peach is an intelligent and well-adjusted adult with extreme artistic talent and a good head on her shoulders.  She's witty, a great conversationalist and in general, clearly a very secure woman with a lot of self assurance.  We spend about 40 minutes together at the end of each day between waiting for the bus, and the actual bus ride.  We respect each other's space enough to leave the other alone when one of us is giving off that energy.

Her number isn't in my phone.  We have each other on messenger but never use it unless it's specifically about sending a link to something we've talked about.  We have never hung out outside of work.  Hell we don't even talk while we're at work unless it's a few words in passing, which is rare since we aren't in the same department.  She doesn't need to vent to me.  She doesn't need to text me paragraphs or ask about my life. We don't need to know each other's business or text back and forth.  The 40 minutes we spend every day is perfect.  I feel comfortable and completely at ease around her.  She's got a life outside of work and while I'd consider us work friends, that's all it's ever going to be, and I love that.  And you know what?  She's my favorite coworker.  **Because she has boundaries.**

It's taken me a long time to not be drawn to toxic soul-sucking women like Apple and to just understand the concept of having boundaries in general.  Getting to know two very different women within the same context is incredibly eye opening.

I have a life and friends outside of work, but work is a large part of my life so the relationships I form there do matter a lot.  So from these two women I've learned many things, good (Peach) and bad (Apple).

Thanks for letting me vent.  I've built up so much frustration with Apple having to deal with a person like that every day that it's nice to let some of it out, because lord knows I can't talk to her directly without feeling like an asshole.",1,1746578710.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

This has been used for guests that want filter type coffee (which is why the brew burrs are in there). Maybe used 5 times a year over the last 3 years. Has the original hopper as well as a single dose one with bellows. I did remove the declumper a long time ago and misplaced it. This reduced clogging and seemed to make the grinder preform better, so I never put it back. Pickup in Scottsdale AZ would be great but will ship at buyers expense. I also have the original box with all the foam. Zero issues. Works great and is pretty quiet. Excellent Italian craftsmanship.

1)I’m going through things and the idea of having someone comfort me and care for me sounds nice 

2) intimate desires, kinda self explanatory 

3) people around me are finding their husbands and getting married already 

I know I’m young and I haven’t even found anyone yet but it’s always on my mind lol. I have nothing to do with these thoughts at all so it’s pretty frustrating.

Also, I do keep busy. But I think this is my go-to way of self-soothing. Like at the end of a long day it’s nice to imagine someone holding me or whatever 😭 and then that usually leads to wanting to waste more time in my head.

The magical world didn’t always look like this. 

There was a time—older witches and wizards still whispered about it—when magic was wild and elite, cloaked in mystery and prestige. Children with talent were whisked away to ancient schools with floating staircases and talking portraits. They wore uniforms. They drank tea in stone halls. They studied wandwork and battle spells under candlelight, protected by centuries of tradition and a whole Ministry of Magic keeping everything “in order.” 

And back then, if you were gifted, really gifted, you could expect your whole life to be paved in glowing runes and golden opportunities. 

But magic, like everything else, changed. 

Bit by bit, the magical world began to modernize—forced to mimic the non-magical world to stay relevant, to stay funded, to stay safe. Magical governments collapsed under the weight of corruption and inefficiency, and were replaced with boards and bureaucracies. The Ministry was disbanded. The grand old schools lost their luster. Arcane arts were reshaped into measurable, certifiable skills. Education became standardized. Trade schools replaced master-apprentice models. Insurance companies learned how to bill for hex removals. Magical licensing became mandatory. 

Now there were magical databases, budget meetings, and corporate mana consultants. Magic was on a clock-in, clock-out schedule. It had safety manuals and quarterly reviews. 

Some called it progress. Others called it the great dimming.  

Lyra Primley called it exhausting. 

She wasn’t old enough to remember the old world. But she had been raised on its echoes—on stories of shining duels and enchanted libraries, of gifted children saving the world before they were old enough to vote. She believed in those stories. She was one of those gifted children. Top of her spellcasting class by age eleven, crafting custom enchantments before most kids mastered their first ward. 

But no one had told her what all that power would cost her. Magic, it turned out, was not free. 

Pushing herself too hard, too fast, had left invisible scars—ones that got worse over time. Her joints now bent in ways they shouldn’t. Her legs trembled when she stood too long. Her stamina vanished like a smoke spell in a breeze. 

The same magic that had made her exceptional had chewed through her body like a parasite, and there was no spell to reverse it. 

And so, at twenty years old, Lyra found herself very much like the world she lived in: still magical, technically, but held together with paperwork and aching bones. 

Which was how she ended up here. Lyra adjusted the hem of her long, charcoal pencil skirt as she stepped into the room, the soft fabric of her flowy button-up catching a breeze from the open window. Her hair, cropped short on the sides and wild in the back, framed her face in a soft copper mullet that swayed with each step. She looked like she’d walked straight out of a magical zine—half witch, half tired academic, and entirely herself. 

Her cane clicked softly against the tile with each step, the polished wood humming faintly with stored mana. Once, she'd carried a wand—sleek, traditional, and far too fragile for her needs. Now, her cane served as both balance and focus, a steady conduit for magic and a reminder that power didn’t always look like perfection. 

Standing at the edge of a gravel lot, a beat-up duffel bag at her feet and a dull throb already starting in her hips, Lyra stared up at a wooden sign that read: 

Job Corps: Magical Trade Program  

“Reignite your path. Rebuild your power. Rediscover your purpose.” 

The sign had clearly been enchanted to sparkle when the sun hit it, but the charm was old and flickering. Much like Lyra. 

She squinted up at the building beyond the sign—plain stone walls, buzzing security wards, a banner that read WELCOME ORIENTATION DAY! :) like it was trying too hard to smile. 

People in uniforms were already handing out clipboards. The line for check-in curled around the building like a magical snake that had given up halfway through transforming. 

Lyra took a shaky breath. Her mother’s voice echoed in her ears—You have to try, Lyra. We can’t keep waiting for things to get better. 

Her magic sparked faintly in her fingers, then fizzled out like a dying lightbulb. 

Because when your dreams fall apart, sometimes you don’t get a second chance. 

You get Job Corps. 

Lyra’s first impression of Job Corps: Too many smiles. 

It was like everyone in the room had been given the same spell to look excited, no matter how they felt inside. The large hall was cramped, filled with a mishmash of nervous students, most of them looking at their shoes. There were a few who looked overly eager, too polished, probably the ones who had a backup plan if this didn’t work out. 

 “Welcome to Job Corps!” the person at the front said, her voice far too bright for 8:30 a.m. “We’re so thrilled to have you all here. This is the first step toward rebuilding your futures. We know some of you might be feeling a little uncertain right now. That’s okay! We’re all in this together. Let’s dive right in, shall we?” 

The crowd murmured in vague agreement. Lyra wasn’t feeling uncertain so much as exhausted. She had been shuffled through a dozen forms, handed a pamphlet with cheerful “tips” on navigating this new phase of life, and given a name tag with “Lyra Primley – Magic Apprentice” slapped on it, as if that title still meant anything. The words “Magic Apprentice” felt like a joke now, like an old role she no longer fit. 

The room smelled faintly of stale coffee and old parchment. On the far side of the hall, an enormous banner proclaimed ""Reignite Your Path: Choose Your Future!"" under bright, dancing letters that made her head hurt if she stared too long. 

Beneath the banner, a cheerful woman in an 

almost-too-casual uniform stood at the front, holding a clipboard like it was a wand. 

“Now,” she said, clearly reading from a well-practiced speech. “Before we get into the details of your magical training and future opportunities, we’ll need you to sign a few things. Just some basic agreements about conduct, safety, and—yes, I’m afraid—paperwork.” She gave a wink that was almost too cheery to be sincere. 

Lyra forced a tight smile and scribbled her name across the form in front of her. Her hand trembled just a bit, and she could feel the old strain in her joints—a deep, familiar ache that never really went away. 

“Alright! Now, let’s talk about your options,” the woman continued, clapping her hands together. “When you signed up, you picked a trade, right? Great! But here at Job Corps, we want to make sure you’ve had the chance to sample a few other fields as well. Why? Because we believe that every student should get the chance to truly discover their calling!” 

Lyra’s eyes drifted over to a bulletin board in the corner of the room where various “career opportunities” were pinned—distant, corporate-sounding titles like “Mana Consultant,” “Potion Specialist,” and “Field Research Assistant.” 

Great. Just what she needed. A career in consulting. 

The woman at the front beamed. “You’ll start with our Career Exploration Tryouts! Each of you will get hands-on experience in a range of trades, from construction to enchantment to medical magic. Trust me, we have something for everyone! Our mission is to make sure you’re not just trained, but prepared for what’s out there in the magical world.” 

The crowd murmured again, this time a little more enthusiastically. Lyra barely heard them—her mind was already buzzing, spinning like a spell gone wrong. 

Did she even want to learn new trades? Could she even handle more magic without pushing her body further into the ground? The idea of trying new things felt like a test she wasn’t sure she could pass. 

“Next up!” the woman chirped, not noticing Lyra’s hesitation. “Let’s talk about your Training Achievement Record, or TAR! You’ll be using this to track your progress and make sure you’re hitting your personal goals along the way. It’s like a magical progress report, but with a twist—we make it fun! 

Your TAR will be filled with achievements, milestones, and of course, a few celebratory moments along the way.” 

A few students laughed politely at that, as though “celebratory moments” could make up for the fact they were probably going to end up in debt and doing soul-crushing magical labor for the rest of their lives. Lyra didn’t laugh. 

“Once you’re assigned to your dorm, you’ll have weekly check-ins to see how you’re doing with your objectives. We like to keep things positive, but we also expect results.” She pointed to a chart on the wall—each achievement had a corresponding icon: a broom for cleaning, a cauldron for potion mastery, a hammer for construction skills. “Don’t worry—this is all about you and your progress. You’re in control.” 

Lyra forced herself to look up at the chart. A stupid part of her wanted to rip the paper down and set it on fire. The positive little icons all looked like mocking reminders of everything she had failed to do. Everything she couldn’t do. 

A few students had already started whispering excitedly about the clean dorm awards and the upcoming work-study opportunities, but Lyra’s mind had already gone somewhere else. Somewhere quieter. Somewhere far away from here. 

“Alright, students!” the woman said, snapping her fingers. “Time for your next session: Team Building and Dorm Assignments! Your new community starts today. You’ll find your names listed at the back of the room—don’t be shy! Go ahead and meet your dorm mates. I’m sure you’ll make some great friends!” 

Lyra’s heart sank. She had just signed up to do this. It was supposed to be a second chance. But she wasn’t sure if she had enough magic left in her to make it work. 

Still, she stood up, slowly. With a deep breath, she walked toward the list, scanning the names for her assigned dorm. Her fingers touched the paper. There it was. 

Lyra Primley - Dorm C, Room 3 

She let out a breath. One step at a time, she thought. Just one step. 

Lyra walked into Dorm C like she was stepping into the belly of a beast, fully expecting it to swallow her whole. The hallway was dimly lit, with faded carpet and the faint smell of something between cleaning solution and stale pizza. At least the walls weren’t as uncomfortably bright as the orientation room had been. 

She found Room 3 easily—there was a piece of paper on the door with her name hastily scrawled across it in permanent marker. For a moment, she stood there, hand hovering over the doorknob, wondering if she could just walk right past it and pretend this was someone else’s problem. But no. She had made it this far. Barely With a deep breath, she turned the knob and pushed the door open. 

 The room was cozy in a way that tried, a small space with two beds already made up in a crisp, overly neat manner, and a desk beside each. There was a third bed, clearly unclaimed, and a set of drawers with her name on them. 

Everything screamed temporary—but it was hers for now. 

The first thing Lyra noticed was the girl sitting on the floor by the window, reading a book. The second thing was the loud, overenthusiastic voice that greeted her. 

“Hey, you must be Lyra!” a girl with dark hair and wide, blue eyes said, standing up and brushing the dust off her hands. “I’m Hanna. Hanna Montgomery.” She grinned, a flash of brightness in a place that felt so... grey. “We’re roommates! Obviously. And this”—she gestured to the girl by the window—“is Elizabeth Oakley.” 

Elizabeth Oakley didn’t look up from her book, a thick tome that looked old enough to belong in a library rather than a dorm room. She had light brown hair pulled back in a messy bun, and a pair of glasses perched on the bridge of her nose. The quiet aura she gave off was the complete opposite of Hanna’s bubbling energy. 

“Nice to meet you,” Elizabeth said softly, without looking up. Lyra gave a half-wave, her nerves clawing at her throat. She had never been good at first impressions. 

Hanna, on the other hand, seemed determined to make it impossible to feel awkward. “So, you’re from primrose academy, huh? Mrs. Faraway told us about you! You must have some crazy abilities.” She leaned against the bedpost, crossing her arms. “I bet you’re the type to do spells in your sleep.” 

Lyra hesitated, feeling the familiar wave of discomfort at the mention of her past. “Not anymore,” she said quietly, glancing toward the third bed in the corner. She set her bag down with an almost-silent thud. 

Hanna raised an eyebrow, clearly sensing the shift in the mood. “Right. Well, we all have our things, don’t we?” She flashed another grin, though this one was less about bouncing off the walls and more about understanding. “No pressure. We’re just here to make it work.” 

Elizabeth flipped a page in her book, not seeming to care much about the conversation, but she nodded slightly in agreement, her expression neutral. 

Lyra moved to her bed and sat down slowly, feeling the weight of the day press into her already-aching joints. “I’m not much of a spellcaster anymore,” she said, her voice quieter now. “Actually, I’m not sure I can even... do it the way I used to.” 

There was a pause. Hanna’s smile faltered, but only for a second before she recovered, plopping down on her own bed with a little bounce. “Well, magic’s overrated anyway. I’m just here to figure out how to do something useful with it,” she said with a light shrug. “We’ll all figure it out, one way or another.” 

Lyra wasn’t sure how to respond to that. She had no idea if magic was overrated, or if she’d even be able to do anything with hers again. She didn’t know how to feel about the future when she wasn’t even sure if she could make it through the present without her body breaking down again. 

 “I guess we all have our own path to follow,” Lyra said, trying to smile, though it felt strange on her face. 

Elizabeth finally looked up from her book, her eyes sharp behind her glasses. “Yeah,” she said simply. “No one comes to job corps because their happy with where they are.” 

Lyra raised an eyebrow, sensing there was more to that statement than she could figure out. Elizabeth’s gaze held hers for a moment, as if measuring her, before the quiet girl returned to her book with a decisive flip of a page. 

Hanna, noticing the tension, leaned back and grinned. “Anyway, enough of the heavy stuff. Have you seen the snack room? It’s unbelievable. I’ll show you where it is later. But first, let’s figure out who’s doing the cleaning this week. I’m not dealing with another dusty bathroom, thank you very much.” 

Lyra nodded, grateful for Hanna’s unrelenting cheerfulness. It was a nice change from the silence that usually weighed on her. 

As she unpacked, Lyra couldn't help but wonder what this experience would bring. Whether she'd be able to fit in, whether her magic would find its place again... or whether this would just be another step toward losing herself entirely. The thought of the next two years felt like a mountain in front of her, but for the first time that day, she didn’t feel like she was standing alone at the base of it. Maybe, just maybe, this new chapter could work out. ",1,1746578071.0,BookPromotion,0,1.0,False

I'm in a relationship, I know I'm an asshole.

I did a solo project in my country to raise money for endangered animals in Ukraine. During that time, I needed help so contacted a group of fantastic singers who also provided me with amps etc. I met and worked with one Ukrainian lady especially, and we got along. Both of us made a super successful event. Then it ended, we raised a lot of money, she hugged me and left.

I realized that I wouldn't see her much anymore the next morning, and I fell into a depression. This was about 5 months ago, and my partner realized that I was feeling something. So, one night I was drunk and confessed it.

I love my partner now, but we've been together almost ten years since, since I was 20. It was a sham marriage to get her citizenship, and she stayed after that, that was 10 years ago. I feel like I've lost my 20s. I went to therapy and was told to write to the Ukrainian lady to find closure. So I did. I said that 'if I was single, I would love to invited you to dinner'

She took it well, said she was happy to be friends and go for coffee etc. and it was nice, but I wasn't allowed to talk to her. She still likes my Instagram stories and posts. She's either the second or third account that interacts with me the most. She likes almost all of my stories. I was on vacation this week, made a few stories and a post, but she doesn't seem to like my stories anymore. This makes her feel even more distant, and I know that someday soon she'll disappear forever back to Ukraine. I'm kind of sad, but I just had to say it to someone. Sorry for this rant.

Lyra forced a tight smile and scribbled her name across the form in front of her. Her hand trembled just a bit, and she could feel the old strain in her joints—a deep, familiar ache that never really went away. 

“Alright! Now, let’s talk about your options,” the woman continued, clapping her hands together. “When you signed up, you picked a trade, right? Great! But here at Job Corps, we want to make sure you’ve had the chance to sample a few other fields as well. Why? Because we believe that every student should get the chance to truly discover their calling!” 

Lyra’s eyes drifted over to a bulletin board in the corner of the room where various “career opportunities” were pinned—distant, corporate-sounding titles like “Mana Consultant,” “Potion Specialist,” and “Field Research Assistant.” 

Great. Just what she needed. A career in consulting. 

The woman at the front beamed. “You’ll start with our Career Exploration Tryouts! Each of you will get hands-on experience in a range of trades, from construction to enchantment to medical magic. Trust me, we have something for everyone! Our mission is to make sure you’re not just trained, but prepared for what’s out there in the magical world.” 

The crowd murmured again, this time a little more enthusiastically. Lyra barely heard them—her mind was already buzzing, spinning like a spell gone wrong. 

Did she even want to learn new trades? Could she even handle more magic without pushing her body further into the ground? The idea of trying new things felt like a test she wasn’t sure she could pass. 

“Next up!” the woman chirped, not noticing Lyra’s hesitation. “Let’s talk about your Training Achievement Record, or TAR! You’ll be using this to track your progress and make sure you’re hitting your personal goals along the way. It’s like a magical progress report, but with a twist—we make it fun! 

Your TAR will be filled with achievements, milestones, and of course, a few celebratory moments along the way.” 

A few students laughed politely at that, as though “celebratory moments” could make up for the fact they were probably going to end up in debt and doing soul-crushing magical labor for the rest of their lives. Lyra didn’t laugh. 

“Once you’re assigned to your dorm, you’ll have weekly check-ins to see how you’re doing with your objectives. We like to keep things positive, but we also expect results.” She pointed to a chart on the wall—each achievement had a corresponding icon: a broom for cleaning, a cauldron for potion mastery, a hammer for construction skills. “Don’t worry—this is all about you and your progress. You’re in control.” 

Lyra forced herself to look up at the chart. A stupid part of her wanted to rip the paper down and set it on fire. The positive little icons all looked like mocking reminders of everything she had failed to do. Everything she couldn’t do. 

A few students had already started whispering excitedly about the clean dorm awards and the upcoming work-study opportunities, but Lyra’s mind had already gone somewhere else. Somewhere quieter. Somewhere far away from here. 

“Alright, students!” the woman said, snapping her fingers. “Time for your next session: Team Building and Dorm Assignments! Your new community starts today. You’ll find your names listed at the back of the room—don’t be shy! Go ahead and meet your dorm mates. I’m sure you’ll make some great friends!” 

Lyra’s heart sank. She had just signed up to do this. It was supposed to be a second chance. But she wasn’t sure if she had enough magic left in her to make it work. 

Still, she stood up, slowly. With a deep breath, she walked toward the list, scanning the names for her assigned dorm. Her fingers touched the paper. There it was. 

Lyra Primley - Dorm C, Room 3 

She let out a breath. One step at a time, she thought. Just one step. 

Lyra walked into Dorm C like she was stepping into the belly of a beast, fully expecting it to swallow her whole. The hallway was dimly lit, with faded carpet and the faint smell of something between cleaning solution and stale pizza. At least the walls weren’t as uncomfortably bright as the orientation room had been. 

She found Room 3 easily—there was a piece of paper on the door with her name hastily scrawled across it in permanent marker. For a moment, she stood there, hand hovering over the doorknob, wondering if she could just walk right past it and pretend this was someone else’s problem. But no. She had made it this far. Barely With a deep breath, she turned the knob and pushed the door open. 

 The room was cozy in a way that tried, a small space with two beds already made up in a crisp, overly neat manner, and a desk beside each. There was a third bed, clearly unclaimed, and a set of drawers with her name on them. 

Everything screamed temporary—but it was hers for now. 

The first thing Lyra noticed was the girl sitting on the floor by the window, reading a book. The second thing was the loud, overenthusiastic voice that greeted her. 

“Hey, you must be Lyra!” a girl with dark hair and wide, blue eyes said, standing up and brushing the dust off her hands. “I’m Hanna. Hanna Montgomery.” She grinned, a flash of brightness in a place that felt so... grey. “We’re roommates! Obviously. And this”—she gestured to the girl by the window—“is Elizabeth Oakley.” 

Elizabeth Oakley didn’t look up from her book, a thick tome that looked old enough to belong in a library rather than a dorm room. She had light brown hair pulled back in a messy bun, and a pair of glasses perched on the bridge of her nose. The quiet aura she gave off was the complete opposite of Hanna’s bubbling energy. 

“Nice to meet you,” Elizabeth said softly, without looking up. Lyra gave a half-wave, her nerves clawing at her throat. She had never been good at first impressions. 

Hanna, on the other hand, seemed determined to make it impossible to feel awkward. “So, you’re from primrose academy, huh? Mrs. Faraway told us about you! You must have some crazy abilities.” She leaned against the bedpost, crossing her arms. “I bet you’re the type to do spells in your sleep.” 

Lyra hesitated, feeling the familiar wave of discomfort at the mention of her past. “Not anymore,” she said quietly, glancing toward the third bed in the corner. She set her bag down with an almost-silent thud. 

Hanna raised an eyebrow, clearly sensing the shift in the mood. “Right. Well, we all have our things, don’t we?” She flashed another grin, though this one was less about bouncing off the walls and more about understanding. “No pressure. We’re just here to make it work.” 

Elizabeth flipped a page in her book, not seeming to care much about the conversation, but she nodded slightly in agreement, her expression neutral. 

Lyra moved to her bed and sat down slowly, feeling the weight of the day press into her already-aching joints. “I’m not much of a spellcaster anymore,” she said, her voice quieter now. “Actually, I’m not sure I can even... do it the way I used to.” 

There was a pause. Hanna’s smile faltered, but only for a second before she recovered, plopping down on her own bed with a little bounce. “Well, magic’s overrated anyway. I’m just here to figure out how to do something useful with it,” she said with a light shrug. “We’ll all figure it out, one way or another.” 

Lyra wasn’t sure how to respond to that. She had no idea if magic was overrated, or if she’d even be able to do anything with hers again. She didn’t know how to feel about the future when she wasn’t even sure if she could make it through the present without her body breaking down again. 

 “I guess we all have our own path to follow,” Lyra said, trying to smile, though it felt strange on her face. 

Elizabeth finally looked up from her book, her eyes sharp behind her glasses. “Yeah,” she said simply. “No one comes to job corps because their happy with where they are.” 

Lyra raised an eyebrow, sensing there was more to that statement than she could figure out. Elizabeth’s gaze held hers for a moment, as if measuring her, before the quiet girl returned to her book with a decisive flip of a page. 

Hanna, noticing the tension, leaned back and grinned. “Anyway, enough of the heavy stuff. Have you seen the snack room? It’s unbelievable. I’ll show you where it is later. But first, let’s figure out who’s doing the cleaning this week. I’m not dealing with another dusty bathroom, thank you very much.” 

Lyra nodded, grateful for Hanna’s unrelenting cheerfulness. It was a nice change from the silence that usually weighed on her. 

As she unpacked, Lyra couldn't help but wonder what this experience would bring. Whether she'd be able to fit in, whether her magic would find its place again... or whether this would just be another step toward losing herself entirely. The thought of the next two years felt like a mountain in front of her, but for the first time that day, she didn’t feel like she was standing alone at the base of it. Maybe, just maybe, this new chapter could work out.

He was sweet, thoughtful, and ambitious when we first met. But over the last two years at his firm (not gonna dox myself but let's just say its name has a comma), I watched him transform into someone I barely recognized. The constant anxiety changed him - he'd snap at small things and could never be present with me, mechanically checking his phone every two (2) minutes even during what should have been intimate moments.

The breaking point came when we planned a weekend getaway for our anniversary. He canceled last minute for a ""client emergency"" - the third time this month. That night, seeking comfort, I confided in Brad, a big shot partner at his firm who I'd met at the holiday party and gave me his number in case my employer ever needed a lawyer. I'd started texting Brad, twenty years our senior, to see if he could lighten my ex's hours, but they only seemed to get longer after that. One coffee meeting turned into dinners, which turned into something more. Brad has been present in ways my ex couldn't be anymore.

I remember my boyfriend's blood spraying the table. 

Pieces of his skull stuck in my oatmeal like cats teeth. 

It's weird. I remember our exact conversation and the song playing on the Amazon Alexa. 

Harvey was side-stepping to the beat and tapping his feet, really feeling the song. 

The smell of burned toast choked my nose, but I was too busy laughing at his corny dancing. 

I told him to open the window. 

Well, I didn't. Harvey was dead before I could open my mouth. 

I was looking directly at him when there was movement at the corner of my eye.

I thought Jules had come in for more kitty food. 

It was my stupid fucking fault for mistaking a psychotic ten year old boy for a long haired tabby.

Harvey came over to me, coffee in one hand, toast in the other. 

He didn't see the kid. 

He didn't see the little boy point a gun at his head, tiny index teasing the trigger. 

Harvey chose the wrong time to lean over the table, swiping oatmeal from my lips. 

Harvey's lips parted in a smirk, as if he was going to say something like, *“You've got a little something there.*. 

But he didn't. 

Because my boyfriend's brains were blown out before the words could leave his mouth. 

I was aware of his blood painting me, painting the table, painting the fucking breakfast I didn't even want– and yet my gaze still found the boy’s eyes filled with impossible stars, insanity and mania entangled into innocent arrogance. 

I didn't know the boy’s name. 

He was short, had tufty brown hair and was wearing a Batman t-shirt. 

I already knew his eyes. 

I knew those stars, those impossible twinkling speckles of oblivion. 

At some point, I dropped my spoon. But I didn't hear it hit the ground. 

Reality was cruel, and this was mine. Harvey's body wasn't the first I had seen. I was used to being painted with blood, chunks of skull sticking to my hair. 

After all, it was my job, as a kids presenter, to look after our town’s psychopaths. 

I had seen my colleagues get their throats slit with unexpected weapons, strangled by tiny hands. 

The little boy took a step towards me, reaching into his pocket slowly, like he was revelling in every second. 

I was used to no panic, no fear, only paralysis that held me to the spot as I waited to die. 

This time, I was sure I wouldn't be spared. 

I was sixteen years old when my parents were murdered by two eight year olds. 

Emily and Eli, the twins who lived next door. 

Starry Eyes Syndrome was a disease in our town that had twisted our younger generation into psychotic murderers. 

It started with an episode of a local TV show. 

Something inside the footage changed the kids watching, filling their eyes with stars. 

The effect wasn't immediate. Initially, they were isolated incidents. 

Kids were suddenly ripping into their stuffed animals.

Then they were quietly killing their pets, hanging the collars like trophies. 

I was home sick from school one day, and my parents were downstairs eating dinner. 

Eli and Emily were like my own siblings. I had known them since they were babies. 

So, it was common for them to walk into our house, usually with chicken pot pie. 

Emily was the loud one, and Eli tended to stay in the background, offering shy smiles if he had to. 

On the night they murdered my parents, I didn't even hear it. 

I woke with a burning fever, and all I could hear was their hysterical giggles. 

“Ruuuuuby!” Eli shouted my name in a sing-song. I forced myself out of bed, almost tumbling onto the floor. 

I was burning up bad. I had half a mind to dip my face in the cold, untouched soup Mom made me earlier to cool me down. 

Eli was acting overly hyperactive, which meant Mom had treated the twins to a sugar binge.

Since their own mother was a health obsessed almond Mom, my mother allowed them to have one candy bar a week. 

However, Eli and Emily were victims of what I called The Sugar Monster, who turned them into intolerable little brats. 

She wasn't the one babysitting them, so Mom never saw the chaos, the trail of despair they left behind.

I mistakenly gave them a Snickers bar and they destroyed my room. 

This time, I wasn't taking any chances. 

My room was a no Eli and Emily zone. 

I made it clear with the sign on my door. Which they ignored, of course. 

Eli’s voice was getting closer, the *thud*, *thud*, *thud*, of his footsteps coming up the stairs. 

“Ruby, come see! We’ve got a surprise for you!”

Slipping into my shoes, I managed a croaky laugh, pulling open the door. 

“Mom, you can't give Eli sugar!” I found myself shouting into the pitch darkness. 

No response, only Emily giggling downstairs. 

“Ruby! Come downstairs!” I could hear her jumping up and down on the one creaky stair she was obsessed with. 

The hallway light was off, which was odd. Mom reiterated that she had left it on so I could run to the bathroom if I needed to barf.

I was half conscious and delirious when she said this, so maybe I misheard her. 

When I clicked it on, Eli was standing directly in front of me, a shadow lurking in the dark. 

Initially, I thought it was a reflection of the light. 

But looking closer, I was staring, baffled, at tiny twinkling stars in my neighbour’s pupils. 

They didn't make sense to me. 

As if his pupils were filled with star dust. 

Like he had been marked by a God. 

Taking a slow step back, something rancid crept up my throat. 

The boy was standing on his tiptoes, a grin stretched across his mouth. 

Maybe my fever was worse than I thought. 

Eli swung back and forth, his hands planted on the walls. 

He was definitely filled with sugar. There was something smeared on his shirt, lightly staining his palms. 

I blinked and found myself laughing, shaking my head of an eerie thought creeping into the back of my mind. 

“Did you get ketchup everywhere? Eli, what have you been eating?”

He giggled. Maybe it was the dim light, or my raging fever, but the boy wasn't blinking. 

I wasn't even sure he was looking at me, his gaze enveloped in oblivion. 

Something ice cold crept its way down my spine. I grabbed his face gently. 

“Eli, look at me,” I said, “Hey. What's going on?”

Eli didn't react, his smile growing wider. 

“It's blood!” He pressed a finger to his lips. 

Eli was grinning dazedly at something over my shoulder. 

I thought Emily was hiding behind me. 

When I twisted around, there was nobody there.

My neighbour bounced up and down. “Do you want to see your surprise?”

I mocked a frown. “Do I want to see your messy masterpiece? It depends. Did The Sugar Monster help you?”

Eli shook his head. “Nope! We did it all by ourselves!”

I pretended to think about it. “All right. You have my attention.”

He nodded eagerly. “We made it just for you! Come see!”

Nodding, I swiped at my clammy forehead. “Sure. But only if you promise to clean it up. You and Emmy.”

“You're boring,” he grumbled. “Fine! I promise to clean up your parents' blood.”

My footsteps faltered, but he grabbed my arm, pulling me down the stairs. 

I didn't register his words until I stepped into my kitchen where eight year old Emily had peeled off my mother’s face and glued it to her own. 

Mom was in pieces, chunks of her hanging from the wall.

I walked directly into blood spilling across the tiles, the grisly remains of my parents tainting every surface. 

Dad’s body was spread out across the table. They had severed his head and plucked out his organs, displaying them on the table like a game of Operation. 

Emily spread out her hands, giggling. 

“Tah-dah!” she said, when my legs gave-way, and the ground swallowed me up. 

“Do you like it?” their excited shrieks collapsed into white noise. 

I was aware of them dancing around me. Emily crawled over to me and forced my head up with the prick of her finger. 

She came so close to me, I could see the creases in my mother’s flesh glued over her own face, the raw flaps of red sticking over her eyes. 

I didn't move, didn't scream, didn't cry. 

The world felt wrong, like I didn't belong to it. Time flowed slowly, and I was no longer human, no longer capable of emotions. 

I just stared at the little girl wearing my mother’s face, and wondered if this was a product of my fever.

I pinched myself once.

Yes, of course it was.

Twice. 

It was all a nightmare, a hallucination. 

Three times. 

I convinced myself, curling into a ball in stemming scarlet, my parents' blood warm on my skin, as if they were cradling me. Time moved slowly. 

Emily and Eli didn't stop there. 

They hacked at my father’s body until he was nothing, until his blood ran in thick rivulets, pooling off of the edge of the table. 

I watched for a long time, letting it accumulate into a puddle of red. 

Emily was standing over me, a knife clutched in her fist, when her mother walked in, and started screaming. 

Her banshee wails clanging around in my skull reminded me that this was really happening. 

I didn't fully gain awareness until I was sitting in the sheriff's office, a cold glass of water grazing my lips. 

Instead of drinking it, I poured it over my head to cool down my fever. 

“Ruby, can you hear me?”

The voice was familiar. Cold hands were lightly touching my shoulders, shaking me. Shock is a strange thing. 

It feels like you have stopped, every part of you, body, mind, and soul, is stuck in a single moment. 

While the world continues on as normal. It wasn't until I was joined by others, several dozen of us, mostly teens and adults, covered in blood and unblinking, when I realized I wasn't the only one. 

We all had that exact same question on our lips. 

*What the fuck had happened to the children?*

The answer: A local kid's TV show from 2005.

The name was never disclosed. 

Apparently, an episode was mistakenly aired. 

The police weren't specific about the episode’s content, but it was said to have disturbing scenes of bodily horror. 

One of my high school classmates was the sheriff's son, and he told us that the content wasn't just disturbing. 

It was an attempt at brainwashing, twisting and contorting the minds of the town’s children, turning them into psychos. 

The stars in their eyes were like a marking, whatever they had seen still alive, still sparkling in their pupils. 

I had questions, because nothing about this added up. 

I googled kids shows that had caused violence in children, but I was just directed to the infamous Lavender Town creepypasta. 

I didn't know the name of the show, so it was like searching for a needle in a haystack. 

If a disturbing local kids show had aired in 2005, why was it kept quiet, and furthermore, why wasn't it destroyed? 

Did the same thing happen back then? 

Why did it only affect the kids in my town years later? 

This thing had crawled into my neighbour’s head. It was the direct influence of Eli killing my parents, so why didn't I believe it? 

Officially, it wasn't the children's fault. 

That's what the Mayor said.

He told the victims to choose forgiveness over anger, to remember the *good* times with our loved ones, instead of dwelling on their deaths. 

Yet I had found myself standing in my neighbour’s yard, a carving knife in my hand. 

Eli and Emily had been taken away for tests, but in my dazed, muddled mind, I could still see my mother’s face being used as a mask. 

Part of me wanted to hurt them, like they had hurt me. 

They took away my parents and laughed in my face. 

I wanted to scoop their fucking eyes out.

The stars in their eyes were the mark of the devil, according to townspeople. 

But I just saw TV static, like the kids’ eyes were still broadcasting what they saw. 

In the time it took for me to heal from my parents death, I finished my sophomore year of high school and moved in with my aunt. 

The kids affected were brought back into town, declared *fixed*. 

That was until the next day, when a three year old hacked her own mother’s eyes out.

Then a seven year old pushed her father down the stairs and cut off his legs to stick to her stuffed teddy bear. 

The town was in denial that our children's minds had been altered forever and there was no saving them. 

Years passed, and these little kids got worse. 

They didn't just kill. These kids experimented on insects, animals, and humans. 

Four teenagers were found gutted, in a child's attempt to turn humans into animals. Those kids were in my class. 

They were alive one day, and dead the next. 

The sheriff reportedly barfed when he found the bodies. 

The police report said they were barely recognisable, only identified through their teeth and DNA. 

The sheriff's son gave us a far more detailed account, and I had to leave the classroom. 

Emily Adams, one of the victims, had her head stitched to the torso of a dog. Ben Chase had his organs removed, replaced with sewer water. 

Ryan Caine and Thomas Wesley were found in dismembered chunks of both animal and human. 

The perpetrators were seven and nine years old, and their argument was that they were playing. 

Somehow, it became the norm to hear of a brutal death, with the perpetrator being under the age of twelve. 

It was clear that the kids needed a distraction, a way to lull their minds back to innocence that had been cruelly ripped away. 

A new kids show was to be broadcast on a specific channel that would run all day and night.  Following that, the Mayor came out with a law. 

Graduating seniors were not allowed to go to college, or leave town until the situation was resolved. 

We were technically kids too, and with their logic, we could have been affected, and asymptomatic. 

We argued that none of us had watched that show, but it was clear the officials behind closed doors were scared this thing was contagious. 

They were obsessed with keeping the outside world oblivious. 

Nobody outside our town knew about starry eyed Syndrome, and they wanted to keep it that way. 

According to the Mayor, this was our problem. 

If we went to college and had this thing in our eyes without knowing, we were risking the lives of other children.

So, the town law was, either get a 9 to 5, or become a kid's presenter. 

Presently, I wondered if the little fuck pointing his gun at my head recognised me from local TV. 

The boy inclined his head. 

Judging from the smile on his mouth, his index resting on the trigger, he did. 

The stars in his eyes dimmed slightly, and just like that, the boy lowered his weapon. 

I picked up my spoon, and continued spooning oatmeal in my mouth. 

It was the only thing that felt normal, that felt real, at that moment. 

I lost my soul a long time ago, lying in my parents blood. I lost my emotions too, though I think that was related to my job. 

You might not think a kid's presenter is considered a dangerous job, but in this town, it's practically a death sentence. 

The show was an attempt to fix the kids, a comedy involving a group of animals in suits. 

It was a test at first to see if anything would help these kids, and surprisingly, it had worked. 

I was Mrs Bunny, and had been since I was eighteen. 

I got the job pretty much on the spot because nobody else was stupid enough to pursue a job training mini serial killers to be children again. 

I hated my job. I auditioned because part of me wanted to forgive my parents' killers by helping the younger generation find their innocence. 

Two weeks in, I watched a six year old strangle Mr Lion with a lighting cord.

We were told these kids were reformed, that the littles on our show were harmless. Bullshit. 

The second I noticed stars twinkling in Olivia Ash’s eyes, I tried to quit. 

But the studio wasn't stupid. 

They had successfully lured in freshly graduated seniors with a payment that would let us live comfortably. 

I guess they forget to mention that the second we signed our names, we were tied to these kids whether we liked it or not. 

One particular clause in my contract was that if we were injured or killed by a child, the studio was not responsible for our deaths. Which was true. 

In a single month, three performers were dead, and the rest of us were emotionless, mindless drones who wore animal costumes and prayed we weren't next. 

We were allowed therapy, but there's only a certain amount of trauma the human mind can take. 

Therapy and another fucking promotion wasn't the pat on the back the town thought it was. 

Typical. I wanted to help kids who could not be helped, and my punishment for being a naive fucking idiot, was doomed to my parents’ fate. 

Being Mrs Bunny had turned me into a shell of myself.

I think I stopped seeing colour, the world reduced to dull black and white, a fast moving blur I no longer cared about. 

Food tasted the same, drinking never truly dulled my thoughts. 

I thought about smoking weed to maybe try to get fired, but the punishment for a kid's presenter quitting was akin to a public execution. 

If we quit, the town would accuse us of abandoning their children. 

Mrs Pebbles The Penguin made a huge deal of quitting and walking out, tearing up her contract. 

The rumor was that she had been taken away in a black van. I never saw her again. 

The town erased her name. 

*That* was what we got for running away, for ‘abandoning’ a group of kids who could not be saved. 

They were too far gone. I knew that the second Eli appeared in front of me, the night he murdered my parents. 

I didn't even know they were dead, and yet those stars in his eyes reminded me of insanity, a vicious contortion twisting his mind into knots. 

This thing had torn away empathy, humanity as a whole. 

They were monsters that needed to be locked up, or put down. These kids didn't need a kids show to heal them, they needed a fucking white room. 

Try telling that to stubborn parents who *insist* they could be fixed and saved. 

While putting our lives on the line. 

I still felt like a kid. I lost my youth to trauma, and my adulthood was entertaining the monsters. 

Dealing with them every day, witnessing these preschoolers murder and injure and attack innocent performers without any repercussions or consequences, I was losing my fucking mind. 

I didn't want to live in a town that was giving my parents’ killers a second chance, when they had shown zero remorse whatsoever. 

Eli and Emily, now ten years old, had killed their mother, burying her body in the garden and digging her up like a dog. 

They insisted they were better, that the voices in their heads were gone. 

Their mother’s biggest weakness was *being* a mother. 

She still wanted to believe her babies were innocent and capable of changing. 

Eli and Emily sliced her up and buried her six feet under. 

The authorities only found her body when a neighbourhood dog was found chewing on a human arm.

I thought the twins were going to face real consequences this time, but I saw them several days later, the two of them roaming the streets with baseball bats. 

The sheriff's son was right. 

Whatever those kids watched didn't just damage their minds, it rewired their thought process to believe killing was fun. 

If our Mayor really thought he could save our younger generation with a kids show, he was either stupid or delusional. 

Or both. 

Our show wasn't saving them. It was their motivation to continue. 

Throwing us to the slaughter. 

“Here you go, kids! Don't kill your parents, but these guys are disposable!”

Harvey had been a proverbial light, one that would pull me out of the dark, leading me to a semblance of peace. 

And now I was covered in him.

My oatmeal was crunchy, but I couldn't stop eating, stuffing myself and swallowing large bouts of barf when my stomach tried to reject it. 

It was part of my normal morning routine, and my therapist did say when I was feeling overwhelmed, I should return to my routine.  

There was blood splattered on the table and Harvey was dead, but my glass of orange juice was normal. The birds singing outside, and the low hum of the refrigerator, was what I knew.

I grabbed my glass and took a long drink, revelling in the refreshing flush of orange quenching my scratchy throat. 

It tasted like poison, but I kept drinking, until I couldn't breathe. 

Until orange juice was pooling on the table, my stomach in tangled knots. 

The little boy surprised me with a laugh. 

He dropped his gun, reached into his pocket and pulled out a small piece of card. 

“You're funny,” he said, dropping the card on the table in front of me. 

Chewing half a mouthful of oatmeal mixed with barf, I leaned over. It was a brightly colored invite, my name printed on the top in rainbow colours. 

**RUBY!!**

**You are invited to The Children's Society reunion!** 

I swallowed thickly, oatmeal dribbling down my chin. 

**PLEASE, PLEASE, PRETTY PLEASE COME AND SHARE MEMORIES WITH US.**

Love, 

The Children's Society! 

When I lifted my head to question the boy, a silver whistle was hanging from his mouth. 

“Down,” he said, eyes hardening. 

His words were still spiralling in my head when something slammed into me, a physical presence forcing me onto my knees, my hands pressed over my ears, a raw cry ripping from my throat. 

I was aware of warm red splattering from my nose. 

I could taste it on my lips, feel it slick on my hands still stapled over my ears. 

Footsteps. The boy was hovering over me while I screamed for mercy, burying my head into the floor, my thoughts frenzied. 

I sensed him planting his foot on my back, forcing me onto my stomach. 

“Bad rabbit!” his voice floated around in my skull. 

“Bad, bad, bad rabbit!”

“Ruby?”

Blinking rapidly, I found myself no longer in my kitchen. Time had passed, and I wasn't even aware of it. 

I didn't remember calling the cops about Harvey or even getting in my car. 

But according to my phone, the cops were asking for a statement, and Harvey's Mom was sending me capitalised death threats. 

Like it was my fucking fault. 

I was at work, standing outside the girls bathroom, my hands still pressed to my ears, a screech clawing in my throat. 

Mr Snake, also Luke, was standing in front of me, his head inclined like a…

*Bad rabbit.* 

The little boy’s words felt like pinpricks in my skull.

The last thing I remembered was being at his mercy, screaming gibberish, a monster splitting open my skull and stirring my brain into soup. So, why was I still alive? *How* was I still alive? 

“Ruby, you're scaring me.”

Luke’s voice brought me back to reality. 

Mr Snake was a favorite among the children, his soft-spoken voice a highlight of the show. 

He was the least likely of us to be viciously murdered. 

Freshly out of the makeup artist's grasp, already in his Mr Snake costume, my colleague was frowning at me.

The costumes got way too hot, so I wasn't surprised sweat was pouring down his face, glueing thick strands of dark hair to his forehead.

His freckles were his best attribute. 

I couldn't tell if he was smiling, or forcing himself to smile. 

Like all of us, Luke was a liar. 

He lied when he said he was okay, rejecting therapy. 

The guy may have had a voice for little kids, but it's not like he was here willingly. He hated his job as much as me. 

I was home sick a few months ago, and he'd witnessed the brutal murder of Mr Bear, who happened to be his best friend. Luke swiped at his forehead. 

“Are you good, bro?” 

I could never tell if he was being genuine.

“Yeah,” I lied, “I just felt sick.”

He curled his lip. “Bullshit.” 

He was right, but I wasn't going to admit that. 

“I was sick,” I repeated. “I think I ate something.”

Luke didn't look convinced. “Sure.” he rolled his eyes. “Have you seen Nima?”

Something ice cold slithered down my spine. 

Nina was the newest addition to the group of kids on our show. 

She was infamous as the nine year old who had a rapidly climbing attack streak over the years. 

Luke was terrified of her.

“No.” I managed to get out, “Is she not with her others?”

My colleague ran his hands through his hair, a nervous habit. He reached into his costume and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. “Well, where the fuck is she?”

Instead of responding, I followed him back to set, where performers were situated onstage for the intro song. 

The set itself was bright and colorful in a desperate attempt to remind kids *not* to kill. 

But blood had been spilled far too many times for me to think of it as innocent. 

The bright yellow floor had been replaced six times. Luke slumped into his chair, head in his hands.

He was already in panic mode. 

“We’re so fucked, we’re so fucked, we’re so fucked…”

They were already playing the intro song, crew members ushering key performers onstage. 

I hated the intro. I could never get the choreography right, and I still had PTSD from finally perfecting it, tipping my head back to find our newest cameraman’s head taped to the ceiling. 

The crew had been looking for him all day. He lasted two days. Two days, and his severed head was already their toy. 

There were eleven children running around screaming, and not one person was trying to stop them or quieten them down. Elena, fully in costume, was being shoved around by two boys. 

When she raised her fluffy dog-paw, the Mayor who was on standby, sent her a death glare. 

No matter *what* the kids did to us, we could not raise our hand to them. 

Only scold them. 

I think Elena was too scared to speak. 

Per Luke’s words, Nima was nowhere to be seen. She was supposed to be with the other kids at the end of their line. 

Which could only be bad. 

“I'm not looking for her,” Luke mumbled into his knees. “That psycho brat will gut me.”

Leaning against the wall, my mind was already spinning. “But you're their favorite,” I said, a sour edge to my tone. “Why would they kill Mr Snake?”

Luke lifted his head, his eyes puffy. I didn't blame him for crying. 

The last performer who went looking for a lost kid ended up as set decor we didn't find until we could smell him. 

Luke was terrified, his expression twisting, pleading with me. 

His gaze found Mr Panda standing with his arms folded. 

Unlike the rest of the performers, Panda wasn't wearing his head, dark eyes glued to the kids. 

A makeup artist had attempted to tame his sandy hair, only for him to politely tell her to fuck off. 

“What about Freddie?” Luke whispered. 

I followed his gaze. “Are you serious?”

“What? Freddie won't mind looking for her.” 

“Yeah, because he wants to fucking kill her.”

Like me, Mr Panda, also Freddie, was also a victim. 

Nima butchered his parents and little sister right in front of him.  

On his first day, he revealed it so casually, as if he was discussing the weather. 

We were eating lunch, and Luke almost choked on his sandwich. 

In normal circumstances, Freddie would be a risk to the kids and immediately fired. 

However, ‘normal’ had crashed and burned a long time ago. 

Our town was well aware that there were no replacements for fan favorite, Mr Panda, so he was monitored instead. 

Freddie had a hollowness in his eyes that scared me. 

It's not like he didn't talk to us. He was friendly and cracked jokes, but sometimes he would just… turn. 

Freddie smiled a lot, almost like he was trying to embody Mr Panda. All of his smiles were fake. He too was a liar. 

His mood could go from zero to one hundred in a matter of seconds. 

When we went out as a group, he would be fine, and then he would be describing his parents' deaths in vivid detail, like he could never escape it, reliving it over and over again, eyes manic, almost unseeing. 

The last time we went bowling, Freddie talked about Starry Eyed Syndrome all night, so much so that Luke told him to shut up. 

You would think there would be a protocol for this kind of thing, since there were murderous children everywhere. 

And victims of said children were definitely not mentally stable. 

Nope.

It was in *our* agreements that the performer's responsibility was making sure every child was on stage. 

“What's going on?” Freddie came over, reading through his lines. 

I could tell he knew Nima was missing, and by the slightly manic look in his eye, Freddie only saw an opportunity. 

“Nothing,” I said, before Luke could open his mouth. 

I shoved him before he could. 

“That Nima girl,” Freddie’s voice was trance-like, a smile pricking on his lips. 

“Are you… *looking* for her?”

Luke shot me a look. Both of us knew the consequences if Freddie successfully avenged his parents. 

I had no idea if the, *dragged away and thrown in a van* rumor was true, but I wasn't planning on testing it. 

Over the years, I had developed the ability to read my colleague's mind from the look on his face. 

In his case, Luke looked nauseous, which was definitely telling me to keep my mouth shut. 

“Nope! Relax, Guts, it's another kid,” he said coolly, maintaining a smile. “But Ruby’s going to look for her.” 

My colleague shot me a grin with way too many teeth.

*Anything to save himself.*

“Right, Ruby?”

I was trapped under his smile,  well aware of the others staring at me. 

Freddie was considered a danger to the kids, and Luke was being a stubborn bastard. 

Elena was too scared, and I could see Robbie intentionally hiding behind a tree prop, like he could read my mind. 

The others were being ushered to the stage, and for a moment, I was paralysed. I didn't want to go either.

I hadn't felt true panic for a long time, even at the mercy of the boy who killed my boyfriend. 

The feeling of my chest tightening, my breath thinning, was almost relieving. 

Ever since becoming a kid's presenter, I wondered if I had lost the ability to feel human. When Harvey was shot in the head, I continued to eat my oatmeal. 

I was covered in his blood, warm red slick on my cheeks and glued to my hair. I didn't feel anything. I felt numb. 

When the boy pointed his gun at my head, I waited for my body to react. 

But I didn't. 

Like my mother and father, and Harvey, my body was just a sack of useless flesh.

This time, however, was different. 

I was actually panicking, choking on my breath. 

The air felt thick, too hot, and yet I was shivering. 

I didn't *want* to try and find the girl awaiting a victim. 

I didn't *want* to fucking die. 

Unfortunately, it was survival of the selfish. 

I didn't have a fucking choice. 

“Sure,” I deadpanned, “I’d *love* to go.”

I turned my attention back to Luke. “Mrs Bunny is at the back, anyway, so they won't notice I'm gone. I'll be back in five hours. Probably missing my head.”

Luke grinned. He was either oblivious, or pretending not to notice my sarcasm. 

“That's the spirit!” he patted me on the back with his oversized hands. 

Luke grabbed his head and screwed it back on, holding his paw up for a high five. 

“I'll cover for you!”

I ignored his pathetic attempt at sympathy. “Thanks.” 
 
Luke knew I was shaking. 

He knew I was struggling to breathe. 

But he also wanted to stay alive. I couldn't blame him for that. 

With a two fingered salute and a guilty smile I couldn't see, he grabbed Freddie, dragging Panda Boy away before I could lose all my composure and volunteer the selfish *snake* as tribute. 

The studio was a labyrinth I was yet to explore. 

I only knew the ground floor, where the local TV channels were made. 

I found Nima in the broadcasting room, on the second floor. 

The little girl was standing very still, her eyes lit up in eerie blue light. 

Stars, reflecting from the screen in front of her. There was a body hanging from the ceiling, one of our cameramen strung up by his legs. 

I caught a flash of silver in her hand, a knife clenched between small fingers. 

Nima had carved off his mouth, gaping flaps of scarlet revealing skeletal teeth. 

I forced a smile, just like I was told to do. But I was standing in his blood. His name was AJ. He was seventeen years old. 

I took another step, biting down on my tongue. 

“Nima,” I said softly, “Sweetie, what are you doing?”

Nima didn't turn around, her starry eyed gaze glued to the screen. “Watching TV.”

I turned my attention to the screen. It was an old broadcast, way before our show started. 

Looking closer, though, the broadcast was on air. 

The TV show was vibrant red, streaks of colour bleeding through. 

There were four little kids waving at the camera, their smiles wide. There was something looming over them. 

I didn't know what it was until the camera panned upwards, revealing a body hanging upside down. It was a man, his eyes wide, terrified.

There were two girls and two boys. 

One girl, a ponytailed brunette, jumped forward with a giggle. “Who wants to learn about the human body?”

“Me!” a brunette boy with freckles followed suit. I took a shaky step closer, my stomach twisting.

I recognised those same stars, sparkling static that was so much brighter than any I had seen. In the boy’s hand was a kitchen knife. 

He held it up with a giggle. “Safety first!” his voice was mocking, the other three mimicking him. I knew what was next. I had seen it, almost like a copycat. Eli stringing my mother up and gutting her. 

I didn't move when the boy plunged the knife through the man's stomach, dragging the blade straight down. 

“Yay!” The second boy jumped up and down. “Now, to name all of the organs!”

He reached into the gaping cavernous flaps of flesh, pulling out stringy intestines. 

“What are these called?”

Nima held up her own knife. “Intestines!”

I didn't realize the kid’s voices were in my head too, until I caught myself mimicking them. 

“Intestines.” I breathed.

I could guess their next words, already choking on them. 

*Very good!*

The kids laughed, their gazes following mine, like they could hear me. 

“Very good!” Ponytail praised. She took the blade from the boy, and thrust it into the man's head. 

When slithering red followed, a fountain of blood splashing their faces, they laughed, and the footage faltered for a moment. 

Through three bright colors flashing on the screen, I heard the unmistakable sound of children's laughter. 

It felt almost… close, my skin prickling. 

Like they were right behind me. 

Red. 

Blue. 

Green. 

I couldn't move, suddenly. 

Couldn't blink. 

I found myself entranced, frozen. The picture fixed itself, the freckled boy inches from the camera. 

His starry eyes were more akin to static, like something was alive, drowning his pupils. “Who wants to learn about the human brain?”

“I do!” Nima said, waving her knife excitedly. 

It wasn't the man's brutal death that twisted the minds of a whole generation of children which held me in a trance, bugs filling my mouth, skittering across my skin. Panic. 

I was suffocating in it, drowning in a feral fear I thought I had lost. I didn't watch the man brutally skinned and opened up for education. 

I didn't watch the very first kids with starry eyes paint themselves in his blood. 

Instead, my gaze was glued to the little girl who had my mother’s eyes, dark blonde hair tied into pigtails. 

Who waved her scarlet hands, giggling with the others, the four of them ripping into glistening red with slimy fingers. 

She shrieked with laughter, her unblinking eyes filled, polluted, with static. 

When the girl’s gaze met the camera, my legs gave way. 

I could move again, released from whatever held me in an iron grip. 

When I hit the ground, I was aware my hands were wet, slick with blood. 

But I couldn't move. The room was too small, the walls closing in. 

The little girl on screen was me. 

“Aww.”

Luke’s voice came from behind me, his breath on my neck. 

His gaze was stuck to the screen, and, just like the little boy on the show, Luke’s eyes were filled with stars.

He inclined his head, mimicking his younger self, lips splitting into a grin. 

“Weren't we *cuuuuuuuute*?”

His eyes found the screen, like he worshipped those stars. 

I opened my mouth to respond, when Nima let out a cry.

Luke’s body jolted, his eyes rolling back, before he seemed to get a hold of himself. 

My colleague blinked, the stars going out. 

“Ruby?” Luke shook his head, confusion clouding his expression. I could have sworn there was static in his voice, like those stars were creeping down his throat. 

“What are you…” He shook his head, “doing in here?”

Luke’s dazed gaze found Nima, and then the dead cameraman hanging above us. 

He staggered back, planting a hand over his mouth. 

“Oh, fuck, what did she do?!” he whisper-shrieked. “Is that AJ?”

Luke approached Nima slowly, talking to her in hushed murmurs, but the girl was still smiling widely at the blue screen. 

Which was still on air, I thought dizzily. 

If that thing was still on air, then kids were still locally watching it.

“Ruby!”

Luke was hissing my name, but I was taking slow steps toward a pile of DVD’s.

The top one caught my eye. 

ELENA (T. C. S AUDITION).

LUKE (T. C. S AUDITION). 

I flipped through them, my hands trembling, until I landed on my name. 

RUBY (T. C. S AUDITION). 

“Bad rabbit!”

Nima’s sudden shriek rattled my skull, and I impulsively slammed my hands over my ears. 

When I twisted around, stuffing the DVD down my shirt, the little girl was pointing at Luke.

There was something in her hand. 

The whistle, I thought. The exact same whistle the kid had earlier. 

Luke held his hands up, his cheeks paling. He shot me glare. “What the fuck did she do?”

I couldn't move my lips. 

“Nima.” Luke spoke softly, though his voice was shaking. “We just want you to come back with us, all right?”

The little girl shook her head. “Bad rabbit!” 

I was barely aware of Nima sticking the whistle in her mouth. 

Luke dropped to the floor, a raw screech escaping his mouth. 

Whatever this thing was, his reaction was worse,  turning him into an animal begging for death, his body jerking violently, hands slammed over his ears. 

When the girl blew the whistle again, he stopped moving, whimpering into his knees. 

Nima stepped on his hand, and he let out a shriek. 

Luke stayed still, curled into himself. 

The third time she blew the whistle, I did hear it. 

I was suddenly bleeding from my nose, toppling onto my stomach. 

The sound didn't hit me until the pain did, electroshocks running through my skull. I could hear it, a static screech getting closer, a sentient parasite creeping into the meat of my brain. Luke’s cries sounded feral, almost animalistic, like he was close to jumping up and wrapping his hands around her neck.

I felt it too. It was like a primal urge to attack my attacker. 

Nima loomed over me, a shadow with sparkling eyes. 

She stamped on my head, my nose bursting on impact. 

Her voice rang in my head, drowning Luke’s screams into a dull murmur. 

*“Play dead.”*

Just like that morning, my body entered autopilot. 

I wasn't aware of myself until I was sitting on my living room couch, staring at my television screen filled with stars. 

No. 

Static. 

The invite was in front of me, crumpled and stained with old red. 

**RUBY.**

Fuck. 

Eli and Emily. 

Nima.

General advice appreciated.

I (28m) matched with someone (27f) on bumble, I think she’s very attractive and we seem to have similar interests. I shoot my shot and she responds back to me via text. She’s giving me heart reacts to my messages and is interested in meeting up for coffee after texting a bit and realizing we know a few of the same people.

I just got back from the coffee date and I enjoyed myself. We had a good conversation and seem to share a similar world view and interests, but throughout the date I found her hard to read.

She was engaged in conversation, but wasn’t making much eye contact. She laughed a fair amount during the conversation but I really wasn’t making jokes ever. I tried a couple of times to be direct in expressing interest by smiling and saying stuff like “I’m glad we met” or “I’m really enjoying talking with you.” But couldn’t really get reciprocation.

I’m gonna text her to make plans for a second date, but I’m not sure if I picked up on the vibe right. I never felt like she was giving me the cold shoulder, but on dates that I’ve been on that went really well in the past, my partners were very forthcoming about enjoying themselves and greatly expressing interest. 

Anyone with experience with first dates like this that care to weigh in?

1kgjt47,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kgjt47,ProConstitution Gathering & Update,"Nothings left Brewery, Wednesday 7-9

As of our last meeting we have had 195 different Tulsans (and surrounding areas) attend a meeting. A few (amazing) people have showed up multiple times but mostly I’ve seen people attending or running other activist events in Tulsa!!! 

If you are watching the news and wanting to know how to start fighting for yourself feel free to stop by one of our meetings. We will connect you with other groups in Tulsa where you feel like you can make an impact. There are over 30 groups here in Tulsa and every single one of them could use your help. 

Update: 
Our group focuses on promotion, recruiting, and organizing(when asked) for other groups in Tulsa and their events; However, as we talk to new people we find areas that don’t have the attention that they deserve. That is why we are working on the following:

Physical Activism: Giving a voice to the small towns in Oklahoma: Protest in Catoosa May 17th 2-4

Community: Creating non-partisan events. 
Skill share starting with crochet May 15th (further info TBD). We are working to keep this cost as low as possible. If you would like to donate, participate, or host your own skill share please dm me. 

Litigation: we want to work on helping with the impeachment of D. Trump. First step is a meeting to write letters and to get educated on what we can do)


We have a lot of very positive successes to talk about this week at the state and national level. 

Keep holding the line everyone! If you want to get connected with Tulsa orgs, if you want to help with any of our events, or if you just want to try out the super cool Nothings Left Boozy Snowcones, we’d love to see you. 


Coming up: 
Wed - ProConstitution meeting (7-9)
Thur- Roger Stone Protest (5:30 to 8)
Fri- start of indivisible’s “keep up the pressure” campaign 
-arts and crafts (making protests signs and flyers) Neff Brewery 7-9 
Sat - Tulsa protest, Turkish festival, really really free market, Hands Off protest (71&Memorial)
Sun- pro constitution meeting collab coffee 10:30

Modifier: ""Bills Won't Pay Themselves""
Jitter appears.

Instead of fully stopping, you must remain walking for the duration of jitter's caffeine rush, As it will down its comically large cup of coffee in seconds. You must walk for at least 2-3 seconds before you can continue running again. It gives the player more time to react before the initial attack cause of the coffee.

Jitter's design takes inspiration from both dozer, and his main method of attack, Caffeination to heighten his ability to catch the player. Though, His attack is also a matter of swallowing your pride. If he suspects you may be going faster than him, He will become envious.

Jitter has no relation to Dozer, or his variants other than his form and method of attack.

His hint note says; ""eerily similar to the yellow one. slow down when it caffinates.""

(Bonus!)
String Modifier: ""All-Nighter""
Jitter brought back-up.

Jitter is now holding two comically large coffee cups, And will cycle through 2 attack phases similar to Litany. After this, A hand will shove Jitter to the left of the screen, Showing Dozer to be the culprit before he attacks as usual. After Dozer's ambush attack, They will both depart from the screen.

I slowly started to question things, but I don't think he went further than the issues at hand. 
    He started having bigger personal issues in the past few years... it was during that time, that I started looking into things .... but I was scared ...so I skirted around it...and I'd search at night.... never did a real deep dive. 
   About 3 months ago I blurted out a Joseph Smith sad fact and he kinda lost it. Then he found out it was true... it rocked him.
   Me: I found out more and more until I didn't feel like I had to pay, and that I shouldn't pay tithing anymore. (surprisingly he has gone along with and gets my reasoning) I realized I don't get much, if anything out of church. And I can hardly stomach the fake concern and fake friends anymore. I'm currently trying to not be so upset about the fakeness... but I'm really just there... I don't have a calling, don't want one... and rarely go to church. 
I've gone to the temple ... and saw with my own eyes. It just is not ""special"" anymore.
   Him: He started drinking coffee about a year ago. But I think mostly just because he doesn't think its a big deal. He is upset that the church kept the truth about the gospel restoration from us. So he purposely left the last general conference off. But he sounds like an apologist sometimes about the same subject.
    My question is.... I am getting mixed signals... sometimes i think he gets it ... then sometimes its like he wont see the truth. Has anyone been thru this kind of thing with their spouse? ... Did they ever stop waffling? I just wish I could fast forward.

-Meet 2-3 times a month 

-Each meet will have an overall theme, could be manufacturer, car type, wrap job, etc. (ideas pls)

-Going to make to make a discord as I think that will be easier to coordinate.

-Spot where we meet will change each time 

-After each meet we go for a drive 

-Adding flares for when people take pics it will be easy for others to locate and share 

It’s a rough open right now but I think it has potential to be a fun thing to do and build a good community of like minded people. Again PLEASE give me feedback and thoughts!

Month ago got poor AMH and slightly low AFC back will post all the details below. I am 34 and haven't been on birth control for the last 10 years, never smoked and haven't drank for the past 7 years. I am diabetic (since 30) but hve my sugars under good control.

I am in Canada and while my province has coverage for the cost of one retrieval it doesn't cover the medication which will be about 7.5K CDN alone.

Below are my numbers, I am getting AMH and AFC retested this coming day 3. My vitamin D levels are also now back in a good range thanks to a strong vitamin D prescription as is my ferritin.

all stats from day 3

AMH: 4 pmol/L (**0.56**)  
AFC: 8 follicles  
FSH: 6 mLI/mL  
Vit D: 54 nmol/L  
Estradiol: 195 pml/L  
Progesterone: 0.6 nmol/L  
LH: 4mIU/mL  
TSH: 2.1 mIU/L  
Ferritin: 78

(at present D is up to 83.6 nmol/L and ferritin at 123)

I found this out when I had just made arrangements to do 2 months travelng and working in Europe. Since I will already be traveling I plan on visiting some clinics that specialize in DOR.

I also bought a MIRA hormone tracker in hopes of keeping closer track of my levels over the next 2-3 months to ensure that there is nothing bigger going on.

I feel like my clinic in Toronto basically didn't even use the words DOR but immediately told me that I should strongly consider freezing eggs. I had to folow up alot and ask for a followup appointment. I also suspect due to some other symptoms I have had for the last 4-5 years that I have either Cushings syndrom/disease or something autoimmune and only just got my fam doc to give me a cortisol test. I have to chase everyone to test me for things and do my research. Doing that tomorrow.

Would love to hear from folks about their experiences in Spain and other places in Europe about how their clinics informed their decisions for protocols. I am not interested in using egg retrievals as an experiment into what works, I bought the Mira to do the testing myself and want a clinic that will formulate the protocol based on all my factors, diabetes, age, everything.

I am also interested in getting STEM cell ovarian rejuvination because I will only be doing two rounds of retrievals (whatever the outcome) Let me know your thoughts. Won't be making any embryos, just freezing the eggs that can be for now. ",2,1746575748.0,DOR,0,1.0,False

I'm in a relationship, I know I'm an asshole.

I did a solo project in my country to raise money for endangered animals in Ukraine. During that time, I needed help so contacted a group of fantastic singers who also provided me with amps etc. I met and worked with one Ukrainian lady especially, and we got along. Both of us made a super successful event. Then it ended, we raised a lot of money, she hugged me and left.

I realized that I wouldn't see her much anymore the next morning, and I fell into a depression. This was about 5 months ago, and my partner realized that I was feeling something. So, one night I was drunk and confessed it.

I love my partner now, but we've been together almost ten years since, since I was 20. It was a sham marriage to get her citizenship, and she stayed after that, that was 10 years ago. I feel like I've lost my 20s. I went to therapy and was told to write to the Ukrainian lady to find closure. So I did. I said that 'if I was single, I would love to invited you to dinner'

She took it well, said she was happy to be friends and go for coffee etc. and it was nice, but I wasn't allowed to talk to her. She still likes my Instagram stories and posts. She's either the second or third account that interacts with me the most. She likes almost all of my stories. I was on vacation this week, made a few stories and a post, but she doesn't seem to like my stories anymore. This makes her feel even more distant, and I know that someday soon she'll disappear forever back to Ukraine. I'm kind of sad, but I just had to say it to someone. Sorry for this rant.

1kgjibw,https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1kgjibw/rto_woes_from_an_overworked_dad/,RTO woes from an overworked Dad,"RTO isn’t and has never been about efficiency. Anyone still pretending otherwise is either straight-up delusional or just clinging to whatever scraps of authority they think they have left.

I work night shifts. You know how many people are in the building with me? Maybe two. Three if someone accidentally forgot they had PTO. That’s it. I’m literally sitting alone in a dark-ass office, doing the exact same shit I could be doing at home … and now I get to waste two hours of my life driving back and forth, so some ass-hat can sleep better at night thinking they’re “leading” by forcing people to badge into a ghost town. … Guess who sees us? Absolutely no one.

Our entire agency is built for first shift. Mandatory meeting? Cool. That’s three hours before I even clock in, but sure, I’ll just roll in half-dead so you can read off a PowerPoint I already skimmed in the email you sent. I will work my assigned core hours — and nothing else. I’m done bending over backwards to accommodate a schedule that doesn’t even acknowledge my existence.

One or two RTO days a week? Yeah, fine .. whatever man.. I’ll suck it up. But even that makes zero sense. Nobody is collaborating at 9 PM. Nobody’s walking around high-fiving each other or swapping ideas over the coffee pot. The only thing happening is me typing in silence while being treated like some zoo exhibit for the sake of appearances. It’s a giant waste of time, of gas, of energy, and of brainpower I could be using for literally *anything* else.

“work-life balance”? that cute little buzzword leadership loves to throw around. **I’m enrolled in school full-time, pulling 12 credit hours, trying to build a future that doesn’t completely suck. On top of that, I’m raising three kids on the spectrum — which already demands more patience, stability, and energy than most people can even fathom.**

***They don’t need a Dad who’s burning out just because leadership wants a body in a chair.***

They need me present and functional not drowning in performative bullshit.

RTO is nothing but a power play. A productivity LARP. A half-assed illusion of “normal” for leadership clinging to 1940's fantasies. They want warm bodies in buildings, even if there’s no reason to be there and no actual chair to sit in. It's not about teamwork. It's not about communication. It’s about control.

What stings the abso-fucking-lutley most is that I swore an oath that I take that seriously. I have always gone above and beyond what was asked of me. I’ve upskilled, cross-trained, studied, helped where I wasn’t required to and genuinely tried to be someone people could rely on. I’ve done everything I could to serve better with the scraps of free time I have left.

Have I ever been recognized for it? Hell no. Will I be? God no.  
But here I am, still grinding. Still trying. And it absolutely *kills* me to be treated like dirt for it.

Stop screwing over people like me. We’re not asking for much — just a little logic, a little respect, and maybe the chance to do our jobs *without* being punished for succeeding quietly.

Now this woman is dating my bf’s  brother (37m). How do I handle this?","Throwaway. There’s a lot but gonna try to keep it short.

Last year in feb 2024, my bf Sam (38m) were dating exclusively. We were taking it slow since he had just got out of a relationship in Nov 23. One evening, Sam invites me out to watch a game at a bar with his friends. I say sure and I’ll let him know when I’m ready. I get ready, and text him to ask where to meet him. I see Sam read my text (we have read receipts on) but he did not respond. I texted him again 30 mins later. He again reads the text within 7 min but doesn’t not respond. I texted him again and same thing happens, he reads but does not respond. I am very upset. 

The next day, we schedule a phone call at 6pm to work through him blatantly ditching me. He was supposed to call me, 9:30 rolls around and I text him I’m going to bed. He then calls me 30 mins later and says “he was on the phone with his parents”.

Turns out, his friend that invited him showed up to the bar way late with a date, and they were off by themselves, and Sam had been talking to Leann (37f) that whole time at the bar while he was ignoring me. From 7pm until 1:30 am. Leann and Sam went to high school together but were hardly friends. She is single at this time and he said she was flirting with him until he mentioned to her that he was dating someone (me). He and her had deep discussions about his previous relationship and she gave him unsolicited advice not to date because he had just gotten out of something. But he still was ignoring me to talk to this woman for HOURS and did not value my time by ditching me. I later found out (without him telling me) that the night after when he was supposed to call me, he was actually on the phone with Leann.

A month later she texted him to go to coffee (in my opinion she was sending out feelers to see if he was still dating me), he said “rain check” and never followed up, because he knew he had already broken my trust with her. Sam and I get through it and since then he has never ditched or lied to me and we have a great relationship. I thought that whole thing was over.

Fast forward to recent times, Sam and I are hanging out with his brother, Paul (37m), and a couple other of friends. All of a sudden, Leann shows up. Her and Paul are dating now, and I have to meet her and act like I have no idea who she is. They reconnected on instagram, but literally did not speak one word to each other during high school (coming from Sam). Sam definitely mentioned to Paul that he had run into Leann a year ago, and either way, I find it so strange Paul and her are dating when she clearly was interested in Sam first. Paul has had a couple different stories of how they reconnected, which seems suspicious to me that he keeps changing his story. i think she brother hopped when she realized Sam wasn’t interested. His first story was that she friend requested and messaged him “out of the blue”.

That night with the surprise Leann situation, I handled it well but I realllllllly don’t want to be around her moving forward. How can I best navigate this situation when we hang out with Paul often??",3,1746575369.0,Advice,13,1.0,False

I had always been a man of routine. Wake at 6:15 AM. Shower. Shave. Dress in one of my five outfits. The predictability grounded me necessary for a job where operations never slept and changes never stopped moving. 

Sarah used to tease me about it. \*\*""\*\*You’re like a Swiss watch except way cuter, and slightly less expensive to maintain.""

That was before everything changed. 

The morning it began, I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, razor gliding over stubble. Steam curled from the shower, softening my reflection. The scent of Sarah’s lavender shampoo lingered. She’d showered earlier than usual. 

Movement flickered in the fogged glass. Sarah stood behind me. But wrong. 

Her posture was rigid. Her face slack. And her eyes—her eyes.

Where warm hazel should have been, there were only voids. Not just dark but lightless. Pools of perfect black that swallowed the air around them. 

The razor slipped. 

""Jesus!"" I spun, pulse pounding. 

Sarah blinked and her eyes were normal again. 

""Sorry, sweetheart"" she muttered, dabbing my cut with a tissue. Her fingers were ice. Far too cold for someone who’d just stepped from a hot shower. ""You were so focused, I didn’t want to interrupt."" 

That night, I dreamt of mirrors. Endless corridors of them, each showing Sarah behind me with those black voids for eyes. Every time I turned, she vanished, only to reappear in the next mirror, always watching. 

I woke at 3:17 AM to an empty bed. 

From the bathroom came running water and humming. Sarah’s voice, but…wrong. A lullaby her grandmother used to sing. One she’d sworn she couldn’t remember. 

When she slipped back under the covers, her skin was frigid. ""Just washing my face,"" she whispered. 

I lay awake until dawn, certain I could still hear that off-key humming echoing through the house. 

**Journal Entry 2**

Three days passed. I nearly convinced myself it had been stress. 

Then, at work, I looked up from my desk. Sarah stood at the end of the hallway. 

Black-eyed. 

Unmoving.

Her head tilted at an unnatural angle. Arms limp. That impossible grin stretching her face. 

My coffee cup shattered on the floor. 

""Whoa, easy!"" Mike knelt to help. ""You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost."" 

""Do you see?"" I pointed. 

Mike frowned. ""See what?"" 

She was gone. Her vanilla perfume hung thick in the air. The expensive kind I’d bought her. Far stronger than it should’ve been. 

My phone buzzed: 

Sarah: “Thinking of you. Come home soon. 

I called her immediately. 

""Where are you?"" My voice cracked. 

""At home, silly."" The air conditioner groaned in the background. Then static hissed, and beneath it, breathing. Slow. Hungry. 

I hung up. 

For the rest of the day, I saw her in every reflection. The break room window. My darkened monitor. Watching.

When I left, I found a single black hair on my passenger seat. 

Sarah was a blonde. 

**Journal Entry 3** 

3:17 AM. The clock’s red glow painted our bedroom like blood. 

Sarah’s breathing wasn’t sleep-soft. It was measured. 

In. Hold. Out.

Like counting. Like waiting. 

I turned my head. 

She was already staring at me. Black eyes gleaming. Smile too wide.

""You’re always watching me"" she whispered. My own words from last week, thrown back at me in my exact inflection. 

The next morning, every mirror in the house was covered with towels. ""I thought you’d appreciate it"" Sarah said, scrambling eggs. Humming that lullaby. ""Since they seem to bother you lately."" 

I hadn’t told her about the mirrors. 

That night, I went to write in my hidden journal. Only to find every page sliced out. In their place, one sentence in my handwriting: ""I must be imagining things.""

**Journal Entry 4**

""You’re not sleeping"" Sarah said, pressing a cold hand to my forehead. ""It’s affecting your mind."" 

The doctor agreed. ""Stress-induced hallucinations,"" he said, scribbling a prescription. 

Sarah squeezed my hand. ""I’ve been so worried."" 

At home, she poured the pills into my palm. ""These will help"" she said softly.

They tasted like metal. My thoughts blurred at the edges. 

That night, I flushed them down the toilet. The water swirled black before clearing. 

Sarah stood in the doorway. ""Wasteful"" she shouted. ""But I do love watching you try.""

The next morning, the pills were back in the bottle. All of them. Even the ones I’d swallowed. 

**Journal Entry 5**

The grocery store lights buzzed like wasps. 

I turned, Sarah stood at the end of the aisle. 

Black eyed. Grinning.

A child ran through her. No one reacted. 

My phone buzzed: 

Sarah: “Need anything from the store?”

The reflection leaned in, breath like frost: ""She doesn’t love you like I do.""

I ran to the parking lot, every reflective surface showed her behind me. 

That night, I dreamt of mirrors again. This time, my reflection had black eyes. 

I woke screaming to Sarah straddling me, her hands pinning my shoulders. 

""Shhh"" she whispered, breath cold. ""It’s almost time.""

**Journal Entry 6** 

The bathroom light flickered as I splashed water on my face. I barely recognized the man in the mirror—shallow, hollow-eyed. 

Then he blinked. Black.

I stumbled back into Sarah’s grip. In the mirror, her reflection grinned, mouth splitting wide with needle teeth glistening.

""Almost time"" she whispered. 

I pushed free but the bathroom was empty. The mirror was fogged with breath that wasn’t mine. Written in the condensation: ""SOON.""

**Journal Entry 7**

I spit the last pill into my palm. Sarah watched from the doorway, head cocked. ""You’re not taking them.""

The light flickered. Her face stretched, elongating, before snapping back. 

""I don’t need them"" I lied. 

""Liar"" she firmly stated.

A sheet slipped off the mirror. I didn’t want to look. I had to.

Her reflection stood behind me, fingers digging into my shoulders but the real Sarah was still in the doorway. ""You’re mine"" the reflection mouthed. 

I yanked the sheet back. Sarah sighed. ""You’re being paranoid again."" But then her nail lengthened against my lip, just for a second, before retracting. 

I grabbed my phone, flipped to the front camera and my reflection winked. I threw the phone. It shattered. 

From the bedroom, Sarah called: ""Everything okay?""

No. 

The thing in the mirror wasn’t just watching anymore. 

It was learning.

 **Journal Entry  8**

The doctor’s office reeked of antiseptic. Sarah clutched my hand. ""He thinks I’m not me."" Dr. Langford nodded. ""The mind under stress plays terrible tricks."" 

In the car, I checked the rearview mirror. Black eyes. Grinning.

The real Sarah hummed along to the radio. Two of them now and I couldn’t tell which was which. 

**Journal Entry 9**

The house was too quiet. 

Sarah showered. I searched her nightstand—a locket.

Inside: a single black hair. 

The shower stopped. Sarah appeared, dripping wet. 

""You found it"" she whispered. 

Her eyes were black. 

But this time…so were mine.

**Journal Entry 10**

The pills were never for me. 

They were for her. 

To keep her human. 

To keep her from seeing what I’ve become. 

Now, when I look in the mirror, the man who stares back is a stranger. 

Sarah kisses me goodnight, her lips warm. 

Mine are not.

I don’t sleep anymore. 

But she does. 

And when she wakes. I’ll be waiting. 

Black eyed.

Hungry.

# Background

I am 33F and relatively new to running “seriously.” Over the past 3 years, I’ve averaged ~20–30 mpw and mostly trained for fun trail races. I’ve completed a few ultras (two 50Ks), a trail marathon, and one road HM (1:38 PR), but this was my first road marathon.

This cycle, I wanted to challenge myself with speed and road-specific training. I didn’t have the best sense of my MP since I had only run on quite hilly trails (4+ hr was my PR), but I estimated I could achieve a BQ of 3:25 based on last year’s HM PR (1:38) and recent fitness gains.

# Training

I loosely followed the Pfitzinger 18/55 plan (18 week training cycle), though I had to adapt it heavily and shorten workouts due to work (10-hr shifts at the hospital) and life (puppy!). I peaked at 52 mpw, with most weeks in the 35–45 mile range. Body felt good with the higher mileage, and I mostly felt limited by time constraints. Long runs included two 20-milers and several 18–19 milers. Speedwork included strides, hill repeats, and tempo sessions. Weekend long runs were often on hilly trails or incorporated MP (7:30-40ish) on roads.

Strength training dropped off in January, but I stayed consistent with Z2 aerobic volume, speedwork, and recovery. Had to cut short a lot of Pfitz’s mid-week long runs, but still had markedly higher mileage than I was used to, even with two or three rest days per week. Thankfully, I didn’t get injured and got sick only once (for three days).

Training was fun because I’d never focused on road running before, so I PR’d in everything this cycle: 
•	5K: 20:25 
•	10K: 42:35 
•	10 Mile: 1:11:xx

# Pre-race

I tapered aggressively over 3 weeks and only ran a couple of short shakeouts during race week. Slept well, hydrated heavily, carb-loaded with intention, and avoided alcohol the final week. Took two full rest days before the race (with lots of walking).

Race morning: Woke at 5:45, had pancakes and oatmeal immediately and an oz coffee with cream. I had slept decently despite nerves. Missed my pre-race warm up/ shakeout because the event was so crowded!

# Race day details

Weather: Couldn’t have been better—cool (low 50s), sunny, dry, low wind. A dream.

Course: Rolling hills early, flat and fast later, with beautiful scenery—UBC forest, downtown, and the seawall.

Crowds: WAY MORE than I’m used to (trail runner here). The energy was awesome, though the start was chaotic. Collosal lines for the bathroom, so I had to squat behind the Porta in order to make it to my corral in time. (Sorry.) I was able to squeeze my way to the end of the first corral before the gun time.

Fuel: Took SIS isotonic gels every 30 minutes, starting 5 mins before the gun. No hydration pack; just sipped from water/electrolyte cups at every aid station (every ~3K).

Gear: Shorts with gel pockets. Shoes were Adizero Adios Pro 3s.

# Race strategy

Focused on easing into the first 3 miles due to bottlenecking and conserving energy by running tangents (as able). My goal pace was around 7:40/mile, while ""banking time"" on the downhills (7:00-7:20ish; not overdoing it, to save my quads) and easing the pace on the hills (primarily Camuson Street).  I could not find my 3:20/3:25 pacer, so I selected other runners periodically to pace behind, before eventually passing them once I had my big ""kick"" at the final 10k of the race! I was consistent with taking one gel per 30 min, and drank to thirst from aid stations every 3-5k or so (alternating between electrolytes and water). Since I felt strong by mile 10, I dialed up the pace and had negative splits the latter half of the race. No bathroom breaks!

# Race recap

What a glorious course! It was rolling with plenty of gradual uphill/downhills. The city itself is gorgeous, clean and modern, contrasting with the lush forests of UBC’s campus and the mountain views along the Stanley Park seawall. Morale was high because of all the crowds of spectators throughout the whole course! Volunteers handed out cups of water and electrolyte juice every 3k or so.

Miles 1-7: I started conservatively because of the hills and crowds in the beginning, but quickly realized I could handle a faster pace than my original target of 7:40-ish/mile. The biggest hill was the infamous Camosun (about 1.2k and 52 meters), which I’d built up to be way worse in my head than it was! It was also early at mile 6, which helped to get it out of the way. 

Miles 8-14: Flat-ish, serene forests of Pacific Spirit Park and the University of British Columbia (UBC) campus, followed by about 3 miles of speedy downhill to the Kitsilano neighborhood! Picked up the pace here (including sub-7min mile). 

Miles 15-18: Started to feel the sun exposure here, but doggedly followed a lovely lady in front of me, who seemed to be pacing about 7:25-7:30/mile. Slight uphill at Burrard Bridge around mile 18 was manageable.

Miles 19-24: The course was mostly flat on the latter half of the race, so by mile 20 (the seawall at Stanley Park) I felt it was safe to amp it up some gears! Fresh ocean air, mountain vistas, and few spectators made for a calm and focused headspace. Felt good to be passing people at this point, pushing under 7-min/mile, even with burning quads! My militant fueling massively helped with this ""kick""; I had learned my lesson from my last 50k, in which I bonked massively from underfueling.

Miles 25-26.5 (according to my watch!): Slight uphill through the streets of downtown to the finish line HURT, but I pushed with all my might at under 7-min/mile pace!

Quads are VERY SORE, but otherwise feeling good (joints, feet, etc.!) Will take it easy for a few weeks before easing back into base building for next year. 

#Takeways/next steps

Overall, it was a beautiful day and a gorgeous course. I was thrilled by my time (3:15, ten mins faster than my BQ goal), fueling, and surprising negative splits! I am planning to take on Boston next year with a similar training plan. I had underestimated my MP, so I will focus on speed this next training block and might start making loftier goals— sub 3 one day? (Gasp!)

What I mean by this is that after taking ritalin and feeling the effects 30 minutes later I've noticed that that there is a gradual increase in my desire to learn, focus and study.

Because of this, guests get confused about which lane they're supposed to be in, confused about why we're not at the menu and we're so far down, and get, understandably, annoyed with us.

We stopped doing military and veteran discounts, only doing it on certain holidays. The discount is a free drinks. Every CFA employee gets free drinks (besides lemonades, shakes, and iced coffee for us). Why not them? We do have a police officer discount now though... A WHOLE MEAL!

Today, I had a talk with our... HR lady? I believe that's what role she is in. She wanted to talk about me possibly doing the shift pick-ups, but also made an offer if I were to continue to stay with scheduled shifts.

I get paid $14 an hour right now. She said if I were to stay with scheduled shifts, I would go up to $15.25. No one has ever had an on-the-spot raise. We only do yearly evaluations. The reason they're wanting to do this is because they (the higher ups) all agree that I'm the fastest order taker. 

But, I'm still kinda just wanting to do shift pick-ups. They said even if I just do those, I would still get a raise, but not as much (they're not sure the amount yet). Very generous of them of course.

There is still plenty of opportunity for crossover into the diet post but the goal here is to look at the bodily function, pathway, associations with other systems, etc. I'm sure there are many more complex processes than what I've found and I wish I could say with certainty how to reverse every possible scenario but these are just my observations. I hope they provoke thought and remedies for you all.

Regarding exercise below: I'd consider myself active but more in a sense of normal walking. Some days at work are in the office, some outside, some both. What I want to stress for myself is that I intend to find ways to incorporate exercise and see the impact on my SUA as there is positive association between exercise and reducing uric acid. I think I've always tried to limit doing anything above normal to see what parameters I'd get with diet changes only. However, I have been frustrated by 6-12 month intervals in blood work which is too long to follow diet changes without knowing the trajectory and consequences. I also say this because it is possible to eat quite unhealthy but ""look healthy"" due to various forms of exercise - my intent would be to not mask the potential issues. This has generally led to burn out and backsliding on my personal dietary restrictions. I am very determined to be better - and writing this is part of that determination.

Another observation I've made is how inflammation compounds inflammation - i.e. visceral fat storage releases inflammatory cytokines and adipokines; gout flares in joints receive good macrophages to fight the inflammation but can then in turn become inflammatory in themselves through polarization and maybe again with cytokines and chemokines. And this is complicated because you can't exercise while dealing with a flare but you can't lay there for too long either (mental war is a losing battle). I've found that ibuprofen can bring me down (inhibits pro- and anti- inflammatory macrophages) enough and then with general walking and intentional plant based eating, I'm usually fine in a couple days and quit with the ibuprofen. This scenario is kind of a double whammy - getting kicked while you're down. And I'm not a PT but please consider talking to a Dr and doing research in easing into exercise routines if that's a route you're interested in pursuing - afaik your body has to adjust to the stress or you could end up with other non-gout related injuries. Another observation I made was with drinking a bunch of healthy teas while dealing with a flare and how it just wouldn't get better until I quit the teas and turned to prednisone. I believe this has correlation with drinking tea as hydration verses water as main source of hydration and the fact that tea and coffee are natural diuretics and any caffeine content has many impacts on the urate transporters and adenosine, atp, glutamate, etc. Herbal teas can be diuretic causing as well - the issue here is that you may ""reduce production of uric acid"" with the polyphenols in tea/coffee BUT you will greatly decrease the excretion of uric acid because you drank diuretics if you are not massively overtaking them with hydration. I'm not suggesting never drink tea/coffee but be aware of potential issues.

URIC ACID: THE OXIDANT–ANTIOXIDANT PARADOX

""Abstract

Uric acid, despite being a major antioxidant in the human plasma, both correlates and predicts development of obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, conditions associated with oxidative stress. While one explanation for this paradox could be that a rise in uric acid represents an attempted protective response by the host, we review the evidence that uric acid may function either as an antioxidant (primarily in plasma) or pro-oxidant (primarily within the cell). We suggest that it is the pro-oxidative effects of uric acid that occur in cardiovascular disease and may have a contributory role in the pathogenesis of these conditions.

Keywords: Uric acid, redox homeostasis, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease""



<<<To add some keywords: Superoxide, peroxynitrite, Nitric Oxide, ascorbic acid >>>

""CONCLUSION

In conclusion, uric acid is involved in a complex reaction with several oxidants and may have some protective effects under certain conditions. On the other hand, uric acid cannot scavenge all radicals, with superoxide as an example. Uric acid is an antioxidant only in the hydrophilic environment, which is probably a major limitation of the antioxidant function of uric acid. Reactions of uric acid with oxidants may also produce other radicals that might propagate radical chain reaction and oxidative damage to cells. In addition, uric acid itself and/or downstream radicals can engage, as a biologically active proinflammatory factor, intracellular oxidant production via the ubiquitous NADPH oxidase-dependent pathway resulting in redox-dependent intracellular signaling and, in some conditions, oxidative stress. In our opinion, these considerations taken together may explain the oxidant-antioxidant paradox.""

In this study, synergistic hypoudpricemic activities between ethanol extract of Aster glehni (AG) and vitamin B6 were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Xanthine oxidase inhibitory activities in the different parts, leaf, stem, and flower, during spring and autumn were compared. In addition, to improve hypouricemic activity, two chemicals (AG extract and vitamins) were mixed and measured inhibitory activity of xanthine oxidase. As a result, autumn leaf AG extracts showed the most effective xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity and we named autumn leaf AG extracts as AG-D006. In synergistic study, AG-D006 with vitamin B6 showed significantly increased inhibitory activity on xanthine oxidase. AG-D006 with vitamin B6 also showed significantly reduced uric acid level in hyperuricemic rats in vivo. In conclusion, AG-D006 with vitamin B6 might be used functional foods in reducing serum uric acid level in gout.""

It's very interesting that they used 50mg/kg allopurinol on a rat - compare to how extreme that would be for a human dosage when it's normally 100-600 per day. This also seems to be the same case for b6 in the study - quite a bit more than is intended per day.

""Numerous studies have found HU may be linked to various food. The intake of soy products [32] and dairy product [33] are inversely associated with HU. The consumption of nuts, legumes, and whole grains could effectively lower the risk of gout [34]. Vegetables and fruit, which are rich in folate, dietary fiber, and vitamin C, might be useful for protection against gout [18]. Similarly, our study showed that increasing the intake of naturally occurring folate from food sources may decrease the risk of HU in both males and females. Folate occurs naturally in a wide variety of foods. Fruits, fruit juices, and vegetables (especially dark green leafy vegetables) are good dietary sources of folate. Spinach, asparagus, yeast, and Brussels sprouts are among the foods with the highest levels of folate. A variety of protein foods, including lean meats, poultry, eggs, and soy products, are all rich in folate. Legumes (beans and peas), nuts, and seeds also have folate [35].

Uric Acid and Nitrogen Balance

AI Overview: Uric acid is a nitrogenous waste product primarily excreted in the urine. It is a byproduct of the breakdown of purine nucleotides, and its levels are influenced by nitrogen balance. Nitrogen balance refers to the difference between nitrogen intake and nitrogen excretion. A positive nitrogen balance indicates that more nitrogen is taken in than excreted, while a negative balance indicates the opposite. Also see how L-ornithine works with Nitrogen Balance and urea cycle - slightly different but interesting processes. This Nitrogen Balance was an unexpected find for me.

""We found that U.S. adults with higher levels of daily physical activity tended to have lower levels of inflammatory cytokines (CRP and fibrinogen) and lower white blood cell counts, including lower monocytes and neutrophils (Fig 3). More active adults also tended to have lower TSH and T4 levels, and had a somewhat blunted TSH response to reduced T4 levels (Fig 2). Together, these results support the hypothesis that increasing levels of daily physical activity tends to suppress metabolic activity in other physiological systems [15–17]. We find evidence for both systemic metabolic effects via thyroid hormones and in specific systems via reduced inflammation and immune cell counts.""

""Several important implications can be drawn from our research. First, the level of serum uric acid increased accompanied with increment of serum LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and apolipoprotein-B levels. Second, ratios of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein-B to AI were also significantly associated with increased uric acid level. Third, there was a strongly inverse relationship between serum uric acid and HDL cholesterol levels regardless of adjustment for sex and several potential confounders, including dietary, hypertension, diabetes, and health related information, suggesting a crucial role of uric acid in the regulation of dyslipidemia. These finding strengthened on previous studies that showed a pathogenesis overlap among hyperuricemia and dyslipidemia [11, 12]. When establishing the diagnosis of hyperuricemia, especially at higher levels, clinical suspicion of coexistent dyslipidemia should be required. These abnormalities had a close relationship to coronary artery disease (CAD) and deserved to be taken seriously.""

Visceral fat relationship to inflammation

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10215381/Impact of Hyper- and Hypo-Uricemia on Kidney Function

""Abstract

Uric acid (UA) forms monosodium urate (MSU) crystals to exert proinflammatory actions, thus causing gout arthritis, urolithiasis, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. UA is also one of the most potent antioxidants that suppresses oxidative stress. Hyper and hypouricemia are caused by genetic mutations or polymorphism. Hyperuricemia increases urinary UA concentration and is frequently associated with urolithiasis, which is augmented by low urinary pH. Renal hypouricemia (RHU) is associated with renal stones by increased level of urinary UA, which correlates with the impaired tubular reabsorption of UA. Hyperuricemia causes gout nephropathy, characterized by renal interstitium and tubular damage because MSU precipitates in the tubules. RHU is also frequently associated with tubular damage with elevated urinary beta2-microglobulin due to increased urinary UA concentration, which is related to impaired tubular UA reabsorption through URAT1. Hyperuricemia could induce renal arteriopathy and reduce renal blood flow, while increasing urinary albumin excretion, which is correlated with plasma xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity. RHU is associated with exercise-induced kidney injury, since low levels of SUA could induce the vasoconstriction of the kidney and the enhanced urinary UA excretion could form intratubular precipitation. A U-shaped association of SUA with organ damage is observed in patients with kidney diseases related to impaired endothelial function. Under hyperuricemia, intracellular UA, MSU crystals, and XOR could reduce NO and activate several proinflammatory signals, impairing endothelial functions. Under hypouricemia, the genetic and pharmacological depletion of UA could impair the NO-dependent and independent endothelial functions, suggesting that RHU and secondary hypouricemia might be a risk factor for the loss of kidney functions. In order to protect kidney functions in hyperuricemic patients, the use of urate lowering agents could be recommended to target SUA below 6 mg/dL. In order to protect the kidney functions in RHU patients, hydration and urinary alkalization may be recommended, and in some cases an XOR inhibitor might be recommended in order to reduce oxidative stress.

Keywords: hyperuricemia, hypouricemia, urolithiasis, tubular disease, kidney disease, U-shaped association, endothelial function, xanthine oxidase, uric acid transporters""



""In conclusion, both hyperuricemia and hypouricemia cause urolithiasis, renal tubular damage, and kidney injury. With regard to the cardiovascular events, there is likely a U-shaped association of SUA with the loss of kidney function. Its underlying mechanisms could be attributable to two types of impaired endothelial function. The first is the endothelial dysfunction induced by intracellular UA, MSU and XOR under hyperuricemic conditions, while the other involves endothelial dysfunction induced by the depletion of NO and EDHF under hypouricemic conditions. To treat kidney disease in hyperuricemic patients, ULAs are recommended. To treat kidney disease in hypouricemic patients, XOR inhibitors might be useful.""

1kgiypj,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1kgiypj/strange_diner/,Strange Diner,"Hello, my name is Angela. I was recently appointed a court ordered therapist, and they said that I needed to start writing shit down. I can’t really do all of that without mentioning the place I work, though. So, here it goes.
 
I work at a really weird diner. It’s just outside of our town’s limits, and at first glance, it looks like any other ole diner. Chances are, you may or may not have made a pit stop or gotten a bite to eat there or both. We get a lot of out of towners. 

When you go in you’ll most likely see me or my coworker, Beau, teetering about the building and vibing to the jukebox. (Actually, while we do both vibe to the sweet tunes from the jukebox, you’ll probably be more likely to see me teetering about the building. Beau is usually stationary, flipping burgers at the grill.) 

Now, you may be wondering, “what makes it weird?” Well, I’m getting to that. This place is kinda like one of those “the longer you look the weirder it gets pictures.” That’s because, the closer you look and the longer you stay, the weirder the place gets. 

It’s got a small gravel parking lot for customers to park their cars, but if you stand in the middle of it for too long, you get nauseous. There’s these large windows that line two sides of the building, and they’re probably one of the few things that are actually clean about this place. Unfortunately, their cleanliness means that the customers can occasionally get a full view of the rather…voluptuous man dancing on the pole supporting the sign for the diner. I’m not sure if he’s a ghost or just some guy, but I’ve never seen him leave. One minute you’ll be telling the guy off, then you’ll blink and he’s just gone. 

The diner’s interior has got these these old linoleum floors, that were probably white back in the day. Now, they’re stained an off yellow color. An old jukebox sits in the corner, absolutely riddled with bullet holes. It still works and plays music, but sometimes it screams. Whenever that happens, Beau and I will flip a coin to see who will have to go and unplug it.

There’s booths lining the walls, one of them is perpetually sticky, and no amount of cleaning will make it not that way. The stools at the counter are all mismatched, after an incident caused a few to be replaced. 

The kitchen is in the open, allowing everyone to see it and all of its sins. There’s a large hole next to one of the grills, from the rats that’ve lived there for as long as I can remember. The coffee pots haven’t been cleaned, probably, since the 90s. The waffle irons next to it are surrounded in old, spilled batter, and there’s almost always a smell coming from them. If I had to describe it, it would be burnt hair. 

There’s a rag next to the sink that everyone is too scared to touch, as it’s so disgusting it has its own ecosystem. Seriously, it’s got tiny clouds and everything. There’s shelves that house the clean dishes, and every time a dish is taken, it makes the whole diner smell like cigarette smoke for the amount of time the dish is gone. (I don’t mind it, but Beau’s not a fan.)
The small hallway to the bathrooms sometimes smells like roses, and you’ll start to see them growing if you stare at the walls for more than an hour. (They disappear when you blink, though, so it’s okay.)

There’s a hotdog that will randomly appear in one of the two bathrooms, depending on the week day. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday it will appear in the men’s bathroom, but on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday it will be in the women’s. It’s completely gone on Saturday. (No one knows where it goes on Saturday.) If you were to eat the hotdog, another one would replace it the next day. (I have to say, please don’t eat the hotdog, but if you do, just know that neither I nor the Diner will be held responsible for any sickness you get from it.) 

Bones sometimes show up in the storage room. Usually it’s just small ones in someone’s locker or on the floor. We’d originally thought it was the rats trying to stash stuff, but that changed when someone found a whole human skeleton propped up in one of the room’s corners. 

Speaking of the rats, not all of them are “rat size.” They range in sizes from 3 feet to 5 inches, and we’ve given up on getting rid of them. The best we have been able to do, is corral them to the location of the grill. I’m pretty sure that one of them may be fire proof, or at least a little heat resistant. I’ve had to chase him off of an active grill more than enough times to be convinced of this fact. (His lingering presence and refusal to die has earned him the name Professor Squeekers, by yours truly.)

The health inspectors either don’t care about this place, or they really like it. They come by every once in a while, see the diner in all of its cursed glory, and sign it off as “safe.” I’m really not sure why. Especially since I know we’ve had at least two deaths happen at the cash register.

Basically, this place is weird and a bit gross, but it’s a major part of my life. So, I’m gonna be sharing some of my stories and experiences on here. ",4,1746573973.0,libraryofshadows,1,1.0,False

Most times anyone asks about this, they are told ""turn off secure boot.""

I've worked in security for almost three decades, and I can tell you secure boot is not an evil scheme to lock out Linux users.

I dual boot on my primary gaming system with Secure Boot disabled, but after reading this article

[https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/03/how-riot-games-is-fighting-the-war-against-video-game-hackers/](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/03/how-riot-games-is-fighting-the-war-against-video-game-hackers/)

I realized that's not going to be possible at some point in the future. I don't play games with kernel anti-cheat but I could see overall security becoming tied to Secure Boot.

So, on an old 2018 Dell gaming laptop, I installed Win 24H2 with TPM and SB and everything enabled on one drive, and Linux Mint 22.1 on the second drive.

This was the choice that made the difference. During installation, this appeared:

At this screen I created a password and remembered it.

I finished the installation and rebooted. I then got this scary screen as documented here:

Avoiding the replies to just disable SB, I followed the advice by SMG (thank you!) and selected Enroll MOK. I entered the password I used previously, and was able to boot into Linux Mint!

I even had the option to upgrade my Nvidia drivers to 570.133, which I did not realize is currently available in vanilla LM.

As you can see, everything is working.

I call it the “I’m so lonely Demon”,"“The Demon is transient. It only passes through small towns. It tends to settle right outside of town. Right at the edge. You’ll see it at coffee shops frequently and hardware stores. It looks like your neighbor. It only Arrives in a new town on Christian holidays and attends the Sunday of that holiday at the local first Methodist church. 

When people ask if it’s new in town. It says yes without emotion. When they ask if it’s alone it says it has friends in the next town over. The townies see it’s young and assume it’s naive.

The first instinct of the townies is for them to offer it their women and the local crime network tried to lure it in. It rejects both. 

It goes about its day as any normal person would. Yet because it’s so repetitive in doing the same thing over and over and over again as if it was on auto pilot the locals look at it and get this terrible feeling in their gut to Run. 

It doesn’t look for companionship and it doesn’t talk to those its age. It has the same boring routine gym, coffee, hardware store, and it is always asking the locals for work yet somehow it’s paying its rent and affording nice things. 

One day a thug in town asked if it’s lonely living the way it does. The man’s face a grin creeps into its lips growing and growing, he gets a glow in his eyes a white light. His teeth show his grin gets bigger and bigger. He looks at you and says “I’m so lonely!” And he rips an ear off the man and devours his flesh brain—only to move on to the next town.”

I was stable on 20mg for over 4 years. I originally went on Lexapro when I was going through a separation with my (now) ex-husband. I went down to 10 mg six weeks ago. The results were amazing. I was more alert, more productive, I wasn’t as tired and I felt like “myself” again.

Then two weeks ago I completely quit. Still felt great. Except I started having intense nightmares and waking up having trouble falling back asleep and settling down. After about 12 days (last weekend) I had a really busy vacation. Admittedly I didn’t sleep well and I’m also recognizing that I drank coffee every morning (since I’ve been weaning I haven’t really been drinking caffeine). But Sunday and Monday were restful days, plenty of sleep. However, I was still feeling “on edge”. Couldn’t explain it but it was like I was coming down from a high and couldn’t settle.

Then today was awful. First day back at work after a 5 day weekend and I did have coffee AND a soda. Not sure if that’s relevant but I’ve been on an anxiety roller coaster all day and trying to deny it. I’m anxious, then fatigued, then anxious again. This is miserable and reminds me of an echo of the intense anxiety I had when I first started.

Anyways, I just took a 10mg pill. I feel like such a failure. I don’t EVER want to go back to my old anxiety from my divorce. It was terrible. I couldn’t control my anxiety and idk how anyone else does it because I cannot just “sit with it” and “let it flow through me” as a lot of the anxiety literature tells us to.

Dear \[Agent\]

  


\[SUBJECT\]

In 2050s Singapore, an unnamed woman opens her door to learn that she has been flagged as a needy elderly, and is offended. The two girls volunteering to deliver both food and company are unwanted. She lives alone, sure, but she’s not lonely, content to relive memories of her and her best friend—dead forty years but still living strong in her mind. 

At their behest, she reluctantly regales the girls with her life story and feels her loneliness ease with each visit. Unbeknownst to her, dementia has already started taking root. As she starts spending more time in memories of the past than the present, daily tasks become a struggle—remembering how to use the kettle, for example, or how much coffee should go in a cup. Or who exactly that woman in the mirror is. More importantly, she can’t quite recall where to find her best friend.

As her stories get more repetitive, and her behaviour more eccentric, the volunteers start cutting their visits short until finally, food is simply left outside her door. Alone in a world that no longer wants to remember her, the woman sets out to find her dearest friend—vaguely remembering a childhood promise to travel overseas together. 

As she journeys through the city, she sees traces of her best friend, but never the actual woman herself. The longer she spends away from home, the more she tries to cling to familiar, comforting memories. Yet, the harder she tries to cling to them, the less willing they seem to stay. Once familiar streets now feel eerily unfamiliar, and the people she meets cold and unwelcoming. Slowly, she starts to realise that maybe, just maybe, there is no longer a best friend for her to meet.

Set in Singapore, \[BROWN, BROWN EYES\] is a \[WORDCOUNT\]-word dual-timeline literary fiction novel with a central theme of grief and regret as in Kyung-sook Shin’s \[PLEASE LOOK AFTER MOM\], the introspective writing style of Yiyun Li’s \[WEDNESDAY’S CHILD\], and the harrowing impact of dementia as found in Lisa Genova’s \[STILL ALICE\].

For the sake of accurate and realistic representation, portions portraying dementia were crafted with guidance from \[neurology expert\] based in \[country\].

I am a 24-year-old Singaporean currently residing in \[city\]. Death, grief and dementia have played key roles in my life and I wanted to capture it in writing.

I tried to lean in with the direction/ending of the story. I'd appreciate any feedback on whether that came through more!

Also, the dual timeline is supposed to highlight how she slips between past and present. If anyone might be able to offer feedback or insight as to whether I should keep it in, I'd be grateful!

I had my hair colored in Liquid hair salon about a month ago. I want to share my experience as I didn't find many while looking for a hair salon, and want to know your opinion as I feel that I have overpaid for the service. The place is clean with a colorful theme. After welcoming me, I was invited to wait until the appointed hairdresser finishes with the previous client. Black Coffee and tap water are free, and other beverages are available for a fee. I initially wanted coloring and extensions, they had only straight hair extensions, while my hair is curly and frizzy if not straightened. So I decided to stick only with the coloring.

My hair had a grown out balayage and I did box dye it in Dark Golden Brown 3 weeks before going to the salon, as you can see in Image 1.

The appointment was at 1:30 p.m. and left around 6:30 p.m.

My request was to reach this color, Image 2, or as close as possible.

The process started with bleaching my hair to remove the previous box dye. Then the coloring, he started with the lengths then the roots (I am not sure if he used a different formula for them).

Afterward, he washes my hair, and the disappointment started. My roots were something like violet/cherry red, where my lengths are orange/copper red. He tried to fix it the first time, then he called his boss, and they proceeded with putting something (maybe a toner) to my roots, which made it even worse.

So he wanted to correct it again, but I hadn't time left, and was angry and disappointed. He offered to correct it again ""for free"" and we made an appointment in a month as I was traveling abroad for work the next day.

I ended up paying 388 Fr. you can see it in Image 3. The result you can see it in Image 4, right after leaving the salon, and Image 5 in the next day.

My appointment is tomorrow. I will try to update the post then.

1kgin9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy_books/comments/1kgin9z/through_the_unicorns_looking_glass_mike_resnicks/,Through the Unicorn's Looking Glass: Mike Resnick's John Justin Mallory and the Evolution of Urban Fantasy Noir (Remastered),"In a literary landscape where worlds collide and reality bends, few series have captured the delightful absurdity of urban fantasy quite like Mike Resnick's chronicles of John Justin Mallory. Beginning in the late 1980s and spanning over two decades, these tales follow a hard-boiled detective from our mundane Manhattan who finds himself navigating an alternate New York where magic rules, mythological creatures roam freely, and the laws of physics take frequent coffee breaks. Through Mallory's journey, Resnick crafted a masterclass in genre-blending storytelling that combines film noir aesthetics with fantasy adventure and wry humor.

The Origin Story: Stalking the Unicorn (1987)
The journey begins on a cold New Year's Eve in 1987 with Stalking the Unicorn: A Fable of Tonight. Mallory, a down-on-his-luck detective whose partner has absconded with his wife and their agency's funds, is approached by Mürgenstürm, a small elf with an unusual case. The elf has lost a unicorn entrusted to his care, and if it isn't recovered by dawn, Mürgenstürm will face a fate worse than death. Mallory accepts the case, only to be drawn into a parallel Manhattan brimming with fantastical creatures and absurd magical rules.

What makes Stalking the Unicorn so captivating is Resnick’s commitment to maintaining Mallory’s noir sensibility in a setting that operates on whimsy. The clipped first-person narration, cynical outlook, and methodical sleuthing could have been lifted straight from Raymond Chandler—only now applied to a world of leprechauns, goblins, and talking cats.

Mallory’s approach is reminiscent of Garrett, P.I., the titular character in Glen Cook’s own blend of noir and fantasy, which began with Sweet Silver Blues just a year earlier in 1987. But while Cook’s TunFaire is a gritty, cynical melting pot more reminiscent of a fantasy Chicago or New York, Resnick’s magical Manhattan is steeped in surrealism and satire. Mallory is a loner with dry humor navigating a world that seems like it escaped from a fever dream; Garrett, by contrast, is more comfortable in his world and relies on an ensemble cast of oddball allies and his sardonic sidekick, The Dead Man. Resnick's tone is lighter, more whimsical, often bordering on the absurd—Cook’s humor is darker, and the danger more visceral.

The Long-Awaited Return: Stalking the Vampire (2008)
Twenty-one years passed before Resnick returned to Mallory’s world with Stalking the Vampire: A Fable of Tonight, during which time urban fantasy had evolved dramatically. When this second book appeared, the genre was in the midst of a boom led by authors like Jim Butcher, whose Dresden Files had become the face of urban fantasy noir.

This new entry finds Mallory fully entrenched in magical Manhattan when his partner Winnifred Carruthers is mysteriously bitten. The vampire investigation that follows is both a case and a satire—Resnick lampoons the vampire craze of the early 2000s, poking fun at conventions that authors like Butcher used with more earnest dramatic tension.

Where Harry Dresden often fights for the fate of the world—or at least Chicago—Mallory's cases are intentionally small-scale, their stakes personal or ridiculous. Dresden walks the line between grit and melodrama, often dealing with moral compromises and supernatural horror. Mallory, meanwhile, is more bemused than haunted, dealing with mythical bureaucracy, incompetent monsters, and the ever-looming Grundy, who would be more at home in a mob parody than a dark thriller.

Still, all three series share a common DNA: the lone detective archetype dropped into a magical world that resists logic. But while Dresden struggles to bridge his two worlds and often suffers for it, Mallory has no illusions of integration. He never acclimates to magical Manhattan’s logic-defying landscape. He copes with dry wit and sheer stubbornness, solving mysteries not with magical prowess but with patience, street-smarts, and sarcasm.

The Trilogy Expands: Stalking the Dragon (2009)
Stalking the Dragon continues the whimsical pattern, this time with Mallory on the trail of a stolen miniature dragon. The plot dives into the elite world of magical pet shows, yet again elevating the absurd without sacrificing the mystery. It’s a testament to Resnick’s unique tone: fantasy that never takes itself too seriously, without ever descending into pure farce.

Comparatively, The Garrett Files also thrive on episodic mysteries, each volume exploring new slices of the city and subcultures, much like Mallory’s episodic travels through magical Manhattan. But Cook’s world grows progressively darker and more politically complex, while Resnick keeps things nimble and light-footed. If Garrett often becomes embroiled in city-wide conspiracies and ethnic strife, Mallory might instead deal with a runaway leprechaun or a cursed sandwich. That difference in tone is fundamental: Cook writes urban fantasy noir, Resnick writes urban fantasy pastoral, if such a term can be coined—where the forest is full of talking squirrels with criminal records.

Expanding the Universe: The Mallory Short Stories
Between novels, Resnick penned several Mallory short stories, including Card Shark, The Chinese Sandman, and Stalking the Zombie. These are quick-hit doses of Resnick’s signature blend of detective fiction and light fantasy farce. Where Dresden and Garrett often dwell on the emotional toll of their work, Mallory remains coolly detached—even when pursued by zombie gamblers or trying to outwit magical card cheats.

Resnick’s lighter touch sets Mallory apart in a genre that tends to veer toward the grim or the epic. The Dresden Files, with its expanding cosmology and apocalyptic showdowns, represents urban fantasy’s maturation into a full-blown saga. Garrett Files, particularly in later volumes, becomes a meditation on corruption, loss, and the hard price of survival. Mallory, on the other hand, is less about evolution and more about consistency: a man forever at odds with his world, yet never crushed by it.

A Genre-Defining Series
Looking at the Mallory series as a whole reveals Resnick’s subtle but significant contribution to urban fantasy. Stalking the Unicorn appeared the same year as Sweet Silver Blues, yet the two books forecast wildly different futures for the genre. Glen Cook’s influence can be seen in the grizzled protagonists and cynical worldbuilding that became standard in the early 2000s. Jim Butcher would later define the modern tone of the genre—fast-paced, emotionally charged, laced with personal trauma and high stakes.

Resnick, by contrast, offers a gentler alternative. His books resist escalation. The magic remains zany. The violence is rare. The satire is affectionate. And the detective, Mallory, remains stubbornly human in a world where even the laws of gravity might be unionized.

Through the Looking Glass
There’s something wonderfully meta about the Mallory series when viewed across its full timeline. Beginning before urban fantasy was a recognized genre, going dormant during its peak, and returning when the genre had cemented its tropes, it serves as both pioneer and parody. While Dresden Files leans into genre tropes and deepens them, and Garrett Files injects noir into sword-and-sorcery grit, Mallory strolls in like Groucho Marx at a Tolkien convention—slouching against the wall, commenting dryly, and solving a case while everyone else flails about.

Mallory never fully acclimates to magical Manhattan, and that’s the point. His outsider perspective is his strength, just as Resnick’s outsider tone gives the series its lasting charm.

In the end, John Justin Mallory’s adventures remain a delightfully subversive landmark in fantasy literature—a perfect cocktail of mystery, magic, and mirth. Through his looking glass of unicorns, vampires, dragons, and demons, Resnick invites us not just to escape, but to laugh, think, and reimagine what urban fantasy can be.

Yuki walked down the shaded path alone, the gentle light of the moon filtering between the leaves. She breathed in deep, soaking in the peace and starlight, and bothered not with a disguise other than uncomfortably weaving her tails together. The kitsune feared nothing this forest could offer. If the Nameless came en masse, she'd escape easily. There was no Unbound that could threaten her around. If some random priest or official encountered her on the road, there was no way they could interpret her evening walk as a violation of the Grand Bargain.

What a strange day it was. At least she managed to get back at John for that whole name fiasco. Ugh, she had her Yumi disguise go around calling him his *given* name, and now she's committed.

A simple quest to find a few facts expanded endlessly, and now they had a new ally. On the logical side, Yuki had no objections. Some extra muscle would not hurt in their upcoming battles, and she had poured herself entirely out during the fight earlier. Rin was almost *eerily* pure-hearted, if a bit unthinking. Under normal circumstances, she would be the perfect puppet, and the kitsune would have no problem leaving John under her protection as she went out to be proactive.

Yet, she couldn't help but feel conflicted.

The Dragon-Blooded clearly had *issues.* Yuki could see it in her eyes the moment she realized John was scolding her. Her eyes widened, her pulse quickened, shame flooded her… And then she immediately tried to attach herself to him. Still, it should pose no threat to her goals in the long term. She and John would still be aligned. She would still be taught the secret knowledge of his homeland, which seemed ever more *distant* with every conversation.

""Coffee"" beans were quite the hint. When she had headed here from her prison, she passed through many places, including a few port city markets where they were selling international goods, and she had *never* seen such a thing. That meant that wherever he came from didn't have any trade routes directly connected to here, at the very least. Her theory about a sealed realm was starting to look more and more probable… but where would the plant have come from to be placed there, to begin with? Perhaps it was somewhere out in the world, but nobody but John's people had realized its potential as a drink, so it wasn't yet a trade good.

Still, it was something to keep an eye out for.

Then, there was another Presence. It was weak, barely a flicker and most certainly a yokai, but it was there… off the path and in the woods, perhaps fifty feet distant to her back and right. Yuki suppressed the instinct to quirk an ear to face it, but even without that, she could barely hear whatever was making its way through the brush.

Hmm. It sounded small, but it was hard to tell *what* it was. It was another matter entirely if it was something intelligent. It felt predatory, like a beast stalking in the grass, but the way it kept away from her made it seem like it was scared. It didn't feel like a yūrei; there was no hint of human Presence in it.

Sadly, a whole litany of yokai liked to stalk travellers, which made identifying this one challenging. It was too malevolent feeling to be a mujina, and a kotengu would be stalking her from higher up… not that she expected one of those mountain hermits to be down here in the valley. It was upwind, too, so she couldn't catch a whiff of it.

She paused, and her stalker only took one more step before halting themselves, futilely trying to disguise their presence. ""Come out, or I will come get you myself,"" Yuki ordered sternly, although she didn't turn to face her pursuer. The kitsune flexed her Presence, bathing the area in a commanding aura.

They remained still.

She sighed, glancing in their direction, and quickly checked for Nameless webbing at branch level. Satisfied, she *sprung* into action, catapulting herself into the air and landing on a sturdy branch, with only a moment passing before she pushed off it toward the next. Whatever they were startled and turned to flee, but she was faster. She was upon it while it tried to shimmy through the underbrush. Below the moonlight canopy, she beheld a pale, hairless canine bearing a few whiskers.

An Okuri-inu? Now, that was surprising. They were a very low-order yokai, rarely powerful enough to do much more than maul peasants. Cowardly too, given that they generally waited for them to *trip* before doing even that. It was rare that they grew potent enough to form a Name, and this one did not feel like an exception. While tragic victims of the Shape of All Things and the order of the heavens, they were nonetheless dangerous to the common folk. She sighed and pounced on its back, driving the creature to the ground with a yelp.

""Wait, wait!"" the dog shouted in a feminine voice as Yuki drove the yokai's head against the dirt. ""Can't we talk about this? Come on, give me some slack! Yokai to yokai, I was just a bit curious is all. You're angling to be the new local kami, right?""

Yuki remained silent, staring her down. Perhaps she could extract worthwhile information from her before she tore her soul out. ""You've heard of me?"" she curiously asked.

""Yes!"" she eagerly barked. ""The kappa down by the river told me about how you're ridding the forest of Nameless. You want to take over the empty spot, right? That's why you teamed up with the weirdo. Nobody higher up in the Celestial Hierarchy has been here to deal with problems in *years!*"" Interesting. This place was well and truly isolated from the world, wasn't it? It might be even more of a suitable spot to rebuild herself than she previously thought. By the same logic, her ""sisters"" may see that curious blank spot on the social map and realize the same. Competition would be… annoying, and some of their destructive tendencies were unbelievable. It was hard to believe that she could have—Yuki frowned and cut that line of thought off cold. The past didn't matter besides how it informed the future.

Yuki loosened her grip slightly. ""You're part of his shōgi group, aren't you?"" she asked, and the dog yokai frantically nodded.

""Yeah! I'm not any good, but I'm one of his buddies. Come on, we're meeting up tomorrow night. It would be weird if—"" The kitsune pressed down, driving the air from her lungs to quiet her momentarily. 

""Quiet,"" she ordered. That complicated things. Normally, she'd just slaughter her, and that'd be that, but someone might sense remnants on her were she to devour her soul. She didn't want to endanger the progress she made in gaining the trust of the river spirit, not to mention any other potential allies she had yet to meet. Still, she had to protect the poor townsfolk somehow, and an Okuri-inu this close to the town was a *hazard*. They had suffered enough… but perhaps she could make use of her? In the long term, she might be able to nudge her nature in a new direction.

A new Shape may not be out of reach.

""Listen well,"" she growled. ""You have good senses, do you not? I have two duties for you, and if you perform well, you'll be greatly rewarded. If not…"" She trailed off, and the creature beneath her started to squirm. ""First, I would have you not attack any innocent travellers on the road… but if you happen to see groups of armed men travelling on the roads, I need to know. Furthermore, I would have you tell me of any Nameless nests you can find.""

The situation was a win-win. Either the yokai did what Yuki wished, and she got some valuable information for free while making the road safer, or she didn't and *left.* She doubted the yokai was suicidal enough to disobey a violent kitsune and stay around. Oh, she *knew* that her social circle would hear of this… but it was well within acceptable behaviour for Yuki to partake in, so she expected little to no pushback.

The beastly yokai squirmed beneath her. ""Are you insane? I *can't* do that, my instincts—""

""Then I would advise you to simply *leave* if you find yourself stalking an innocent traveller."" Her voice was low, and she stared dead into the Okuri-inu's eyes.

""F-fine! Fine,"" the dog stammered, and Yuki finally released her, standing back up. The canine immediately skittered to her paws and darted away into the bushes like a scared rat. 

Yuki watched it go, tracking the Presence through the bush as it fled, and once it was out of view, she kept track of it with a keen ear. Eventually, she could no longer sense it as it disappeared deep into the woods.

The kitsune headed back to the road. She hopped from branch to branch once more, retracing the steps she had taken before… However, this time, it was less for expedience and more because she didn't want to get poked by a thousand bushes and have to pick twigs out of her fur later. 

She wouldn't give up her thick coat like some *cowardly* kitsune who she knew, even if it was a pain and a half to maintain. She supposed she could transform herself like them to let all that stuff fall out, but that would probably be incredibly difficult in her current state.

One day, she would be back to *herself,* even if the thought still unsettled her on some level. Memories of the depravity of some of her sisters once more came to mind. Ugh. It was terrifying to think she could have ended up like that if she had been less lucky. She'd like to imagine that she'd be above that… but on some level, Yuki *knew* she wasn't.

Sighing, she disguised herself again, but not as 'Yumi.' No, this time, Yuki was a fifty-five-year-old poor lumberjack called Arakawa Itsu. His face was scarred and dirty, and the years had clearly not been kind to his body. Where was once the vigour of youth was now a stooped, aging brittleness that threatened to have him collapse, with no family left to support him with a son long gone to the war front, a wife passed during a hard winter, and two daughters who were married off.

Overall, he *looked* harmless and inconspicuous.

The edge of town loomed, and her shorter stride—and the limp she decided on for some *damned* reason, but she was committed now—made it feel like it took forever to come. Still, eventually, she was walking amongst the squat buildings once more. None were out amongst the outskirts, but she could still see candlelights in some of their windows. The night was still young, after all. Conversations filtered out from some of them, and in others, the sounds of a family enjoying a late dinner. Sadly, she couldn't hear the former, given how much her disguise weakened her hearing. It was a shame; she'd love to better understand what was happening and how most were coping. Aiki and Haru's situation did not paint a pleasant picture, granted, but having more details rarely hurt.

Things grew more lively as she cut deeper into town, stalking amongst them like an unseen ghost. The scattered few she passed by in the streets were all either going to drink or clearly coming home from it, alcohol heavy on their breaths as they stumbled to and fro. Some, groups of siblings or friends. Others, miserable looking loners. None paid much attention to her despite being an unfamiliar face.

Most would have wandered the streets for a good while to find their target. Yuki would not. When they came to find Aiki and Haru, it was still reasonably early in the morning, so it was likely the first stop the tax collectors made that day, and their lodgings were likely in the same direction they came from. That left only perhaps a fifth of the town to search. In hindsight, she probably should have asked Aiki or Haru if the town had a ryokan-style inn. The higher quality of the inn would likely lead to the men hijacking it. While they might have fled town entirely after the failed assassination, she doubted it.

No, they likely sent some runners to report back to their Nameless puppeted leader while maintaining a presence to keep an eye on her and John. If they didn't flee after getting one of their own burned and John showing off some lightning, she doubted a failed proxy attack would do it. Fools.

A group of men walked around the corner, and she perked. Now, there were some familiar faces in that group of five. She didn't know any of their names off the top of her head, but she recognized all but one from that party that went to collect from Aiki and Haru. The lot were clearly upset, glowering and keeping to themselves as they headed across the street down another. After a quick glance around, she hurried to catch up to them. What luck!

The coin purse of the one in the rear hung low and was… tempting. The tax collectors were heading to the north and, glancing around, she could confirm that nobody was watching her. After they were out of sight, Yuki darted down a side street, unnatural speed carrying her silently ahead of them. Taking cover under the eaves of a closed-up shop, she waited for them to approach.

The first passed, then two side by side, the fourth, and finally… Yuki's mark stepped forth, and her hand darted out of the shadows. With supernal speed, she gently opened his pouch and slipped a hand inside, grabbing a small handful of coins before retreating and closing it back up.

Not many. Certainly not enough to make the man believe that he had been robbed blind. She'd certainly not want to agitate his group and make them do something *rash* to someone undeserving.

She slinked back and quickly counted her haul before stuffing it away. Eight copper coins and one iron. Eighteen mon. There was a time amongst the mortal realms when she wouldn't even *bother* carrying something less than a gold, if she carried anything at all and didn't just have an account things were charged against. Beggar's money it may be, but it was *money,* and it was more than she had before, so she couldn't complain *too* much.

This would buy… perhaps a few drinks? It depended on how badly those prices spiralled out of control here. Maybe some was brewed locally, but she couldn't imagine the Nameless would leave such a commodity unmolested on the roads.

She trailed the five men, with none of them the wiser. Even if they decided to look back, she kept well out of sight, hovering the next street over. When you had senses like this, tracking mortals felt almost unfair, although any sympathy was drowned under the weight of what they were doing here. More voices slowly drifted up from down the street, the sounds of spirited conversation drifting upon the night air.

Yuki caught snippets here and there, and what little she did hear wasn't particularly positive. It seemed like the town was more in a ""drink away our sorrows"" type of mood. Suddenly, the conversation quieted, and she knew the tax collectors entered the building. There was a reason they were going out to drink *armed,* and Yuki had seen less hostile territories occupied by foreign armies.

Now was her time. Making sure she looked extra sad and pathetic, Yuki walked toward the bar, emphasizing her limp to make herself seem harmless. The building was a squat single-story and better maintained than much of the town, although the white paint was peeling in a few places. ""I can't believe that he did that!"" she heard one of her targets bellow inside, and it was tempting to just stay out here and let them spill, but the kitsune decided to head in anyhow, in case she needed to give them some *direction*. 

Sliding the door panel open, Yuki walked into the building. The decor was simple but well made, yet what caught her eye the most were the patrons. Most were deeply uncomfortable, glancing toward the tax collectors and finishing their drinks. Some muttered about coming back tomorrow. Some, too deep in their drinks, seemed not to notice. One, though, looked angrier and angrier by the moment. A young man, perhaps in his early twenties. No friends drinking with him. 

He was about to do something and get himself killed. That wouldn't do. It may be a bit rude, but Yuki sat across from him. ""Mind drinking with an old man, sonny?"" she asked, settling down before he could tell her no. She glanced towards the menu. Four mon for a cup. Perhaps a *bit* expensive, but nowhere near as bad as she feared. ""I'll buy you a drink!"" Despite all appearances, she was carefully listening to the men three tables over, although they'd yet to have said anything beyond complaining about how nobody gives them any respect.

His muscles tensed, and he looked like he was about to object before deflating with a sigh and accepting. ""Thanks, old timer,"" he grunted. ""What's your name?""

""Ah, I'm Hideo Adachi. I'm just an old man passing through, but nobody should be drinking alone in times like this,"" she replied with a grandfatherly smile. 

The man glanced toward the group. ""Call me Akemi,"" he muttered. Was he trying to hide his name from them in case they were listening? Interesting, but foolish. Whatever he planned was likely doomed; the undead represented more power than what one mundane man could bring to bear.

It still bugged her that she didn't know what it was.

Still, she smiled gregariously and waved to the server as she walked by. ""Could I get one cup of sake for me and one for my new friend, please?"" Yuki asked, putting eight coins on the counter. The woman nodded before giving a short bow and collecting the coins, speeding off into the back.

""...Why did you want to drink with me?"" 'Akemi' asked after a moment of silence.

Yuki shrugged. ""Nobody should be drinking alone in times like these,"" she blithely commented.

The man narrowed his eyes but said nothing. Soon enough, their drinks were served, and after giving their thanks, the pair started to slowly sip at them with all the care of people acutely aware of how little money they had.

It'd never get her drunk, and a mere whiff of something capable of even slightly affecting her would probably kill everyone in this building dead, but it was *much* better than she expected. It was sweet, fruity… perhaps a bit melon-y? It didn't have any incredible complexity like higher-end stuff might possess, but it was more than serviceable when she expected some awful gutter-swill to meet the demand for something to keep people's minds off things. There was probably a decent brewery nearby, she wagered. Anything similar from elsewhere would probably cost at least double due to Nameless-based attrition.

They had nothing to speak about, and that suited Yuki just fine. What didn't, though, was how her targets stubbornly refused to talk of anything of value. The kitsune decided to take that into her own hands. She bathed them and them alone in a slowly building stream of subtle Presence. If they were well trained, perhaps they'd notice and start to think about things.

If.

The sudden feelings of boredom and a sense of security did their job well, and they all shifted in their seats slightly. ""What a shithole town,"" one muttered. ""Even drinking is starting to get boring.""

Grumbled agreements filtered throughout the group. ""You heard the boss, we have orders from *up top* now. We hang around and keep an eye on that Unbound prick who shits in the woods all day."" They were to… spy on John? Interesting. They don't seem terribly perturbed by their failure to use Rin to assassinate them. Did they even know, or was that a different group's job?

Another roughly hushed him but kept his voice low. ""Shut it!"" He demanded. ""What if he hears you?""

Another round of cups was placed for them, and their conversation went quiet until the server left. Yuki noted they didn't pay. ""How the hell would he do that?"" continued the first. ""You heard the boss. All he does is sit in the woods all day. Now that he got his two new servants, he'll probably go back to doing nothing."" And that was confirmation that the rank and file weren't in the know, even if she didn't expect them to be.

It did, however, give her an *angle* to work if she could somehow expose their leadership for what they were… Hmm. She supposed the big question was if they were directly being puppeted by the greater Nameless or just being manipulated by them.

""Something still gives me the chills about him. The way he looked at us was… weird. I'm no expert, but I have an Unbound step-cousin, and when that foreigner used those techniques—"" the third began, cutting himself before glancing around the room like John might suddenly appear. He was familiar; what was his name again? ""It was like things just *happened.* Like there was no cause to them.""

Kaito! That was it. He was the one who was observant enough to figure out John burned that other one.

""Who cares?"" groaned the fourth. ""We're going to get rotated to a new town soon. Collections are almost done here. He'll probably forget us by the time we get back, anyhow. Unbound don't give a *shit* about anything that's not one of them, a noble, or a yokai.""

Yuki sipped at her cup, filing that tidbit away for later. If they had their marching orders and she could get her hands on them… Oh hoh hoh. That would let her have some *fun* indeed.

The second sighed. ""This tastes like piss tonight. Can't even have fun getting drunk. I'm not sure about you lot, but I'm going to go pass out. Not even any pretty ladies here."" Pounding back the rest of his drink, he stood up, and a few moments later, two of his fellows followed him. The last two were less enthusiastic but evidently didn't want to be left as a mere duo in hostile territory.

The five of them left through the front unceremoniously, and the few remaining occupants of the establishment who hadn't fled untensed, like a battered dog whose owner had left for the day.

Akemi's gaze followed them out, and Yuki saw him getting ready to rise.

""No,"" Yuki whispered, reaching over the table and holding his arm down with inhuman strength. In another era, she may have given him a few drops of her blood and empowered him to right whatever wrong they inflicted on him. Even if that wouldn't kill him on the *spot,* given what was pumping through her body and spirit, the timing would be off. It'd take weeks to train him, at the very least. ""Lord John will handle this.""

The man's eyes widened, but she rose before he could say anything, placing the single iron coin on the table before him. ""Have some more. On me."" 

Then, she was gone into the night.",98,1746572821.0,HFY,8,1.0,False

I’m a new manager and soon to be retail shop owner, of the shop I manage. My question is a simple one, how many cups of tea break/coffee break is acceptable and when is it excessive? We work in a small independent shop in a city centre and I absolutely encourage staff to have a nice beverage with them if they’d like to. Having a coffee/tea/water bottle behind the till to sip between their job, is not a problem with me. The issue now is, with my newest staff member she takes excessive amounts of time to make a hot drink. She arrives at 9am with start time 9am, makes a drink, goes to the bathroom and then starts work on the shop floor for 9:05-9:20am. Then throughout the day she will make 3-5 MORE hot drinks and each one takes 5-10 mins which is nearly a whole extra break. She also goes to the bathroom during her shift often, this is fine too if you need to go, go but she takes so long and often to the point staff are left in busy periods with customers alone (2 staff on shift per shift) My staff have complained they don’t like working with her as it’s basically working alone. One staff member said they nearly were in tears after working with her as the member of staff felt she was basically in the shop alone. 

But hey I could be super strict and this is normal for British working environments (I didn’t grow up in the UK) How do I even begin to approach this? How do I say “Drink less tea and the tea you drink, make it before your shift’ in addition to ‘limit the amount of times you need the bathroom’ (obviously I’d never say that. Can confirm staff member has no medical reasons they’d need to use the bathroom more than others) ",0,1746572478.0,managers,8,0.33,False

Summers are fleeting, aren’t they? One minute you’re packing away winter boots, and the next you’re lamenting the shortening days. For families, this annual sprint often brings one big question: where do we go? We yearn for those golden moments – kids with sticky faces, laughter echoing through pine trees, the simple joy of being together without the relentless ping of notifications. Canada, with its vast and varied landscapes, from rugged coastlines to towering mountains, is absolutely brimming with possibilities for a family escape. But with so many options, where do you even start? That's where this guide comes in. We're diving deep, peeling back the layers, and sifting through the marketing fluff to unearth the absolute best family resorts in Canada – places where memories are actively crafted, not just hoped for. We’re talking about spots that get it, you know? Places designed with families in mind, offering everything from thrilling adventures to blissful relaxation for even the most frazzled parents. So, buckle up, buttercup, and let’s find your family’s next happy place.

Unpacking the ""Best"": What Makes a Family Resort Truly Shine?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. ""Best"" is a subjective term, isn't it? What one family raves about, another might find just… okay. But when it comes to family resorts in Canada, there are some universal truths that separate the good from the truly great. It’s not just about a pool, though a great pool is definitely a plus! It’s about the *whole package*. Think of it like baking a cake – you need all the right ingredients in the right proportions. For a top-tier family resort, those ingredients include thoughtful amenities, engaging activities, comfortable accommodations that actually work for families, friendly and helpful staff (they're the secret sauce!), and a location that offers both beauty and accessibility. Are the kids whining about being bored constantly, or are they happily occupied with activities? Are parents able to steal a quiet moment, perhaps with a good book or a soak in a hot tub, while the kids are safely entertained? These are the real indicators of a family resort that hits the mark. We're looking for places that make everyone feel seen and catered to, creating that perfect blend of excitement and relaxation.

### The Art of Keeping Everyone Happy: Activities and Amenities That Count

Let’s be honest, a bored kid can turn even the most picturesque setting into a bit of a nightmare. That’s why the range and quality of activities and amenities are paramount when searching for the best family resorts in Canada. We’re talking about more than just a playground here. We’re talking about programs designed specifically for different age groups, ensuring little ones aren’t overwhelmed and teens aren’t rolling their eyes.

Consider these crucial elements:

- **Kids' Clubs and Programs:** This is often the holy grail for parents. A well-run kids' club, with enthusiastic staff and a varied schedule of activities, can provide much-needed downtime for adults while keeping the kids happily engaged. Look for programs that offer a mix of indoor and outdoor fun, from crafts and games to nature exploration and storytelling. Some resorts even offer specialized camps or workshops!
- **Water Features Galore:** Whether it’s a sparkling indoor pool (essential for those unpredictable shoulder-season days), an outdoor pool with kid-friendly zones, or a splash pad that’s a guaranteed hit, water is often a key ingredient in family fun. Bonus points for water slides, lazy rivers, or even access to a lake or beach for swimming and water sports.
- **Outdoor Adventures:** Canada is synonymous with the great outdoors, and the best family resorts leverage this. Think hiking and biking trails suitable for various skill levels, kayaking or canoeing opportunities, fishing, and perhaps even guided nature walks. In winter, access to skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, or even just a great tobogganing hill is a huge draw.
- **Sports and Recreation Facilities:** Beyond water, what else is on offer? Are there tennis courts, basketball courts, mini-golf, or even a climbing wall? Having options keeps things fresh and allows families to try new things together.
- **Evening Entertainment:** After a day of adventuring, some low-key evening entertainment can be a great way to wind down. Bonfires with s’mores, outdoor movie nights, family-friendly live music, or even just a dedicated space for board games can add to the overall experience.

### Home Away From Home (But Better!): Accommodation That Works

Finding accommodation that comfortably fits a family can sometimes feel like solving a complex puzzle. The best family resorts in Canada understand this and offer a variety of options beyond the standard two-bed hotel room.

Here's what to look for in family-friendly lodging:

- **Suites and Condos:** Separate sleeping areas are a game-changer, allowing parents to relax after the kids are asleep without tiptoeing around in the dark. Condos or suites with mini-kitchens or full kitchens are fantastic for saving money on meals and catering to picky eaters.
- **Cabins and Cottages:** For a more rustic and private experience, cabins or cottages tucked away from the main resort building can be ideal. These often come with more space, private outdoor areas, and a real sense of getting away from it all.
- **Connecting Rooms:** A simple but effective option for larger families or those traveling with grandparents.
- **Thoughtful Touches:** Are there things like microwaves, mini-fridges, or even pack-and-plays available? Small conveniences make a big difference when you’re traveling with little ones. Comfortable beds for everyone are non-negotiable, of course!

It feels a bit more intimate than the larger Banff or Lake Louise resorts, which can be a plus for some families.

- **Why it's a winner:** Beautiful mountain setting, great indoor/outdoor pool, strong family programming, and a slightly less bustling atmosphere than some of the more famous Rocky Mountain destinations.

### Prairies and Beyond: Unexpected Gems and Wide-Open Spaces

- **Why it's a winner:** Incredible indoor waterpark, endless activities for kids, and a focus on pure, unadulterated fun. Prepare for happy, exhausted kids (and maybe parents!).

Located right on the ocean, it offers that classic beach vacation vibe with a distinctly Canadian twist.

Beyond the Basics: What Else Should You Consider When Choosing the Best Family Resorts in Canada?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, you’ve got a few potential contenders in mind based on location and general vibe. Excellent! But before you hit that ""book now"" button, let’s think about some other factors that can make or break a family vacation, even at the best family resorts in Canada. Little things, seemingly insignificant at first glance, can have a huge impact on the overall experience.

### Dining Options: Catering to All Tastes (and Picky Eaters!)

Food is a big part of any vacation, and when you’ve got kids in tow, it becomes even more important. A resort with limited or unappealing dining options can be a real hassle.

Think about:

- **Variety:** Are there different types of restaurants or dining experiences available? A casual spot for quick bites, a more formal option for a special meal, and maybe even a grab-and-go or cafe for coffee and snacks.
- **Kid-Friendly Menus:** This is a must! Look for resorts that offer dedicated kids' menus with appealing and familiar options (yes, sometimes chicken fingers and fries are a necessary evil on vacation).
- **Dietary Restrictions:** Do they accommodate food allergies and other dietary needs? This is increasingly important, and a good resort will be happy to work with you.
- **Meal Plans:** Are there all-inclusive or half-board options available? For some families, this can simplify budgeting and eliminate the stress of choosing where to eat for every meal.

### The Price Tag: Finding Value Without Breaking the Bank

Let’s be real, family vacations aren’t cheap. The best family resorts in Canada often come with a significant price tag. However, ""value"" isn't just about the lowest price; it's about what you *get* for your money.

Consider:

- **Inclusions:** What is included in the resort fee or room rate? Are activities, kids’ clubs, or certain amenities included? Sometimes a slightly higher upfront cost means you’ll spend less money on extra activities once you’re there.
- **Packages and Promotions:** Resorts often offer special family packages that might include meals, activity credits, or discounted rates for certain lengths of stay. Keep an eye out for these deals.
- **Shoulder Season:** Traveling during the shoulder season (spring or fall) can often result in lower prices and fewer crowds, while still offering pleasant weather and plenty of activities.
- **Budgeting for Extras:** Even at an all-inclusive resort, there might be extra costs for things like spa treatments, premium activities, or souvenirs. Factor these into your overall budget.

### Location, Location, Location: More Than Just a Pretty View

The physical location of a resort is about more than just aesthetics. Think about its proximity to other attractions, the ease of getting there, and whether it offers the kind of environment your family enjoys.

Ask yourself:

- **Accessibility:** How easy is it to get to the resort by car or plane? Is it a long drive from the nearest airport?
- **Proximity to Attractions:** Are there other things nearby that your family might enjoy, like national parks, charming towns, or unique experiences? Being able to take day trips can add another dimension to your vacation.
- **Environment:** Do you prefer a secluded mountain retreat, a bustling beach town, or something in between? Choose a location that aligns with your family’s preferred vacation style.

### The Little Things That Matter: Service and Atmosphere

Sometimes, it’s the intangible things that make the biggest difference. The attitude of the staff, the overall atmosphere of the resort – these things can elevate a good vacation to a great one.

Look for:

- **Friendly and Attentive Staff:** Are the staff genuinely happy to help and interact with families? Do they go the extra mile to make your stay enjoyable? You can often get a sense of this from online reviews.
- **Welcoming Atmosphere:** Does the resort feel relaxed and welcoming or stuffy and formal? For a family vacation, you usually want a place that encourages laughter and exploration, not one where you feel like you constantly have to whisper.
- **Cleanliness and Maintenance:** This seems obvious, but it’s crucial. A well-maintained and clean resort reflects positively on the overall guest experience.

Frequently Asked Questions About Finding the Best Family Resorts in Canada
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so we've covered a lot of ground, and you might still have some lingering questions. That's totally normal! Planning a family vacation can be a whirlwind. Let's tackle some common queries head-on. Do I really need to book way in advance? What if my kids are really young – are there options for toddlers? Are all-inclusive resorts worth the extra cost? These are all valid concerns, and we’ll do our best to shed some light on them.

### Q: When is the best time to book a family resort in Canada?

A: This is a tricky one, as it depends on the resort and the time of year you want to travel. Generally speaking, for popular summer or winter holiday periods, booking *well* in advance (think six months to a year) is highly recommended, especially for larger suites or specific room types. For off-peak seasons or less popular resorts, you might be able to find last-minute deals, but don't count on it if you have specific dates or preferences. Booking early often gives you the best selection and can sometimes lead to early-bird discounts.

### Q: Are there family resorts that cater specifically to toddlers and very young children?

A: Absolutely! While most good family resorts will have *something* for toddlers, some go above and beyond. Look for resorts with dedicated toddler play areas (indoor and outdoor), shallow pools or splash pads, and kids' clubs that accept younger children (some have age minimums). Some resorts even offer babysitting services or rental equipment like strollers or high chairs. Read reviews from other parents with young children to get a good idea of how toddler-friendly a resort truly is.

### Q: Are all-inclusive family resorts in Canada worth the extra cost?

A: It depends on your family's spending habits and vacation style. For some families, an all-inclusive resort offers peace of mind and simplified budgeting – you know most of your costs are covered upfront, and you don’t have to worry about constantly pulling out your wallet. If your family tends to eat and drink a lot, and you plan to take advantage of included activities, an all-inclusive can offer great value. However, if your family prefers to eat out at local restaurants, explore off-resort, or isn't particularly focused on the included activities, you might find better value with a non-all-inclusive option. Do the math and see which option makes the most sense for your budget and preferences.

### Q: What about family resorts that are friendly to families with accessibility needs?

A: This is an important consideration, and thankfully, many family resorts in Canada are making efforts to be more accessible. When researching, look for information on accessible rooms, ramps or elevators, accessible pool areas, and whether activities can be adapted for different needs. Don't hesitate to call the resort directly and speak to their accessibility services or guest services team to ask specific questions and ensure they can meet your family's needs.

### Q: How can I find honest reviews of family resorts in Canada?

A: Online review sites like TripAdvisor, Google Reviews, and even travel forums can be incredibly helpful. When reading reviews, pay close attention to comments from other families, especially those with children around the same age as yours. Look for mentions of the kids' club, pool areas, dining options for kids, and the overall family-friendly atmosphere. Don't just read the glowing reviews; also look at the negative ones to see if there are recurring issues that might be a dealbreaker for your family. Remember to take reviews with a grain of salt, but they can definitely provide valuable insights.
