1ofk8rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shadmere/comments/1ofk8rw/despite_hearing_that_it_was_more_dangerous_than/,"Despite hearing that it was more dangerous than 10,000 Afghanistans, I survived my two-night trip to Chicago.","I made a last minute decision on Sunday to take a trip to Chicago this week.  My wife didn't want to go (she's nervous about any large city), so I went by myself.  But since just by myself, I only stayed for two nights.

Seriously one of the best small trips I have ever taken in my life.

Look, I'll admit it, I'm a rube.  I've barely even big to a big city before.  So a lot of my time was spent gawking at the tall buildings.  

But seriously, [have you guys seen those buildings](https://i.imgur.com/1cLV4sS.jpeg)?  Beautiful.

I went up the [John Hancock tower](https://i.imgur.com/uFa9sM3.jpeg) to the observation deck and I mean, damn.  Loved the views.  [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/FRMR8XU.jpeg).  [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/UkJuIIp.jpeg).  [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/XmM8qfc.jpeg).

Went to [Devil Dawgs](https://i.imgur.com/9Sbf9t2.jpeg) and got a [hot dog](https://i.imgur.com/cDiNOtT.jpeg).  That was great.  The pickle was kind of a lot to crunch through during every bite, but still, it tasted good.

I went to the Chicago Architecture Center and looked through their museum, [then did a boat tour down the river to look at all the fancy buildings](https://imgur.com/a/YmVBrZn).  I don't remember a good 80% of what the guide taught us, but it was still surprisingly interesting.  

And again, I spent too much time taking pictures of pretty buildings.  [This one had a ghost](https://i.imgur.com/GBRKMH4.jpeg)! 

Very pretty at night, as well.  [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/nscF8za.jpeg).  [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/couKqKN.jpeg).  [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/IUBy4bc.jpeg).

They've got a [Starbucks there that's like 4 stories tall](https://i.imgur.com/QvhBADN.jpeg).  I don't even understand what that means.  The top floor served alcohol, so I figured that much out.  But if I were going to spend 20 dollars on coffee, I didn't want it to be at a Starbucks.  Even if they did have some sort of [coffee warp core](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UaRDMCEYxC8). 

For dinner I went to a [Lou Malnati's](https://i.imgur.com/4lxHZFC.jpeg).  Got a [Caesar salad](https://i.imgur.com/MunKutE.jpeg) and a [personal deep dish with sausage](https://i.imgur.com/IrbI1E2.jpeg).  It was good!  The crust was better than I expected.   The salad was actually *great*.  Probably the best Caesar dressing I've ever had.  I need to find out where they get that.

[Really, really pretty at night](https://i.imgur.com/GHlqMJ9.jpeg).  I know I already mentioned that.

The next morning I went to [The Original Pancake House](https://i.imgur.com/suW4TME.jpeg) and got [*very* good blueberry pancakes.](https://i.imgur.com/ORto0X3.jpeg)  I found out later that they're a national chain, and even have some in Texas, but not within two hours of Houston unfortunately.  Damn, damn good pancakes.   

[I took a train](https://i.imgur.com/3olvkqB.jpeg) to Pilsen the next morning.  As a rube, like I mentioned, my entire experience with public transit has been the two weeks I was in Germany a couple years ago.  The Chicago system was . . . almost as good as Munich's.  I was really impressed.  The trains and busses (that I took) weren't as clean as the ones in Germany, Czechia, and Switzerland that I took, but they weren't *filthy*, either.  And getting around using them was not hard using the wonders of a smartphone to tell me which things to take and in what order, lol.

[Pilsen had some really great murals](https://imgur.com/a/d4v23ll), which I'd heard about on reddit.  I also went to the [National Museum of Mexican Art](https://imgur.com/a/bLgAmq6), which was very nice.  Afterwards, I went to a place called [Coyote's](https://i.imgur.com/QAPATo5.jpeg) and had [the best tacos I might have ever eaten](https://i.imgur.com/ATFkPxd.jpeg).  

Then I went up to [Logan Park](https://i.imgur.com/D0cUWaV.jpeg) to just wander around for awhile.  [Some nice murals everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/Ju9W31s.jpeg), it seems.  I went to a chocolate store called Katherine Anne's and got [semisweet drinking chocolate](https://i.imgur.com/9J0yCQg.jpeg).  It was really good.  Much thicker than I expected for hot chocolate.  Wow.  I kicked myself for not getting a bigger serving, but honestly I was eating more than necessary already.  It was also really cool seeing the employee actually working on making the various candythat they were selling, even if that meant she had to tell me to hold that thought mid-order because a timer went off, [and she had to go do something](https://i.imgur.com/ZIpFubO.jpeg), hah.

[I like trains](https://i.imgur.com/xxd2iHI.jpeg).  

I legit don't remember [where this was](https://i.imgur.com/dEeIPTR.jpeg), but it was pretty.

One of my list items to eat was an Italian beef, so I went to [Mr. Beef](https://i.imgur.com/0LkvkAO.jpeg).  Place had some [character](https://i.imgur.com/8tvObxy.jpeg).  I got an Italian beef with hot peppers to eat there.  I felt a little bad sitting the [soaking wet wrapper](https://i.imgur.com/m0UlOwY.jpeg) on their counter, but that was the only option available so . . . sure.  The ""hot peppers"" was more like a[ bunch of pickled celery with some carrots](https://i.imgur.com/Vkwf2dF.jpeg), but it delicious regardless.   That first pic really hid the amount of beef on the roll, [so I took a second](https://i.imgur.com/gyh6bXt.jpeg), for fairness's sake.  

After that, I walked through downtown and into Chinatown.  I know I could have taken a bus, but I wanted to get a nice long walk in. I will say that [this was not exactly the LEAST sketchy place](https://i.imgur.com/PNAOtWV.jpeg) I've ever been, though. But it was a nice walk, with a lot of sights that were really cool, [even if mundane](https://i.imgur.com/mlvMbK1.jpeg), for a rube such as myself.

[I like trains](https://i.imgur.com/Sg4UEL6.jpeg).

[Chinatown](https://i.imgur.com/KHpEuuV.jpeg) was cool as hell.  I got a BBQ pork bun, and a [tiny little moon cake](https://i.imgur.com/S9HqE9a.jpeg) that might well be the most delicious thing I have ever eaten.  Ever.  

I also got to feel a little bit like I was in some sort of [cyberpunk situation](https://i.imgur.com/j2xOGA5.jpeg), so for a weeb like me (a rube/weeb?) it was [kind of awesome](https://i.imgur.com/SgW6sCh.jpeg).  

For dinner I went to [Qing Xiang Yuan](https://i.imgur.com/iW0Y4tG.jpeg) and got [wood ear mushroom salad](https://i.imgur.com/NSbJjwr.jpeg) and [chicken/cabbage dumplings](https://i.imgur.com/QQ0Cz1i.jpeg).  I am not good with chopsticks, but honestly I would have said last week that I could not use them at all, so forcing myself through it really did help my competence.   I only dropped stuff like six times, lol (and four of those were at the start, in a row).

After dinner I [wandered in here](https://i.imgur.com/YiUeVvt.jpeg) and suddenly felt like I was in a Yakuza game.  That's goofy, but in those games I'm *all the time* walking into a [building and finding nothing but nondescript stairs to other places](https://i.imgur.com/4m2AY6M.jpeg).  Okay, that sounded even more ridiculous, but I swear, it felt the same.  Down the stairs, I found a mostly[ empty food court](https://i.imgur.com/AdY90YH.jpeg)/shopping center/like three salons.  The [food situation there](https://i.imgur.com/ZsmpX5i.jpeg) was a bit [above my difficulty level](https://i.imgur.com/ABZQPhe.jpeg), so I'm glad I had already eaten.

I had seen [this place earlier](https://i.imgur.com/bv8Kqih.jpeg) and was intrigued, so I went back and spent like $25 on a [soft cheesecake](https://i.imgur.com/GDdAfl4.jpeg).  I took it back to the hotel room and [ate the entire thing](https://i.imgur.com/ouV9j2n.jpeg).  

The next morning I packed everything back into the [backpack](https://i.imgur.com/nxjKwO9.jpeg), impressed myself by [*just how much* of a tourist I looked](https://i.imgur.com/CLWmtgj.jpeg), went to [Wildberry](https://i.imgur.com/sFrcWUj.jpeg) and got a REALLY good [Eggs Benedict Florentine](https://i.imgur.com/wBTL74M.jpeg).  

Then I went to see the [Cloud Gate](https://i.imgur.com/aIDadBC.jpeg), and it was so amazing that I decided to call it ""the Cloud Gate"" instead of the Bean.  Because holy crap.  I went to see it because, hey, I need to see the Bean, right?  But *oh my god* I did not expect it to be as [amazing](https://i.imgur.com/teyzm27.jpeg) as it was.  I just marveled at it for awhile.  It also made me really happy seeing other [people having a good time](https://i.imgur.com/jwp4Zci.jpeg).

Speaking of marveling, the [Buckingham Memorial fountain](https://i.imgur.com/hkyvNtj.jpeg) (had to google it just now to find out what it was called) was also really, really [beautiful](https://i.imgur.com/6UfgYTd.jpeg).  I'm really glad I turned around at one point while wandering off, or I wouldn't have seen it [spout so high](https://i.imgur.com/4bTadO0.jpeg), hah.

Once it opened, I went to the [Art Institute](https://imgur.com/a/t2HwnBS).  While I took a lunch break, I probably spent close to about 6, maybe 6.5 hours there, and it was not nearly enough.  I rushed like mad through the parts of the modern wing I went to, and there were whole areas I didn't get to at all.  Absolutely amazing museum.  I recommend it so much.

During my lunch break, I went to [Russian Tea Time](https://i.imgur.com/dcAMdzz.jpeg), a Ukrainian-owned place right across the street from the art museum.  [It was actually really nice](https://i.imgur.com/6xjFAMH.jpeg)!  It felt very fancy, but somehow it didn't feel stuffy.  Most people were well-dressed, but a couple girls with facial piercings and metal logos on their hoodies were sitting next to me as well.  They do high tea, there, but I just ordered off the dinner menu.  [And the vodka menu](https://i.imgur.com/AD93lAJ.jpeg).  I got a flight of their house vodkas, but Igor, my waiter, recommended I replace one of them with the horseradish vodka, as it was their best one.  From left to right: horseradish, tea, and coriander vodkas.  Delicious.

I am aware of some sort of joke involving going to a place called ""Russian Tea Time"" and ending up with three shots of vodka.

For my actual food, I got [borscht](https://i.imgur.com/oeFXmC2.jpeg), [a cabbage roll](https://i.imgur.com/fkqQXv5.jpeg), and [medovik](https://i.imgur.com/bJw4ECH.jpeg) (a honey cake).  Everything was good, but I had never had borscht before, and I was surprised at just how much I loved it.  I also absolutely loved the honey cake, but I sort of expected to love a layered honey cake that I've seen for years online and always wanted to try.

Around 6 PM, I realized that if I wanted to get one last meal out of Chicago before going back to the airport, I had to do it now.  So I left the museum and started walking towards the train station, looking for food.  I stopped at a place called Acanto and got [beef carpaccio](https://i.imgur.com/JHJCS2O.jpeg) and [cacio e pepe](https://i.imgur.com/Bgiibvq.jpeg) (which at Acanto involves gnocchi and black truffle).  Both were absurdly good.  Also look at that [cartoon mushroom from the land of cartoons](https://i.imgur.com/UuxBWUE.jpeg).  It's such a cartoon!

Finally time to go home, so I took a [couple](https://i.imgur.com/dZYGatb.jpeg) more [pictures](https://i.imgur.com/1E9cCWs.jpeg) of the city and came back to Houston.",1,1761372834.0,shadmere,0,1.0,False

1ofk7qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/privatehealthcoveruk/comments/1ofk7qm/axa_health_insurance_vs_vitality_which_is_better/,AXA Health Insurance vs Vitality Which Is Better,"Hi everyone,

I've seen the ""AXA vs. Vitality"" question come up a few times, and it's a good one because they represent two completely different philosophies on health insurance. I was looking at a detailed comparison and thought I'd summarise the main takeaways, as it might help clarify things for people weighing their options.

The core difference is this:
- **AXA Health** is built on a traditional insurance model. It's straightforward, comprehensive cover designed to be there with a robust hospital list when you need treatment. It's more of a ""set it and forget it"" policy.
- **Vitality** is built around a proactive wellness model. The insurance is tied to an extensive rewards program that incentivises you for being active (tracking steps, gym visits, etc.). It requires daily or weekly engagement to get the most value.

So, the choice isn't just about cover levels, but about what kind of relationship you want with your insurer.

Here are a few key points from the breakdown:

- **Best For:** AXA is generally better for those who want high-quality, no-fuss medical cover without needing to engage with an app. Vitality is aimed at people who are motivated by incentives and will actively use the rewards program to lower costs and earn perks.

- **Core Cover:** Both providers offer strong core cover as standard. In-patient/day-patient treatment and comprehensive cancer cover are included in their main plans, so you're well-covered for major issues with either.

- **Rewards:** This is the biggest differentiator. Vitality's rewards programme (cinema tickets, coffee, Apple Watch discounts) is market-leading and a core part of their offering. AXA has a more modest rewards scheme (ActivePlus), which is a nice-to-have rather than a central feature.

- **A Crucial Reminder:** It's worth remembering that both, like all standard UK PMI, are designed for acute conditions (like joint replacements, hernias, etc.). They don't typically cover pre-existing conditions or chronic conditions that need long-term management (like diabetes or asthma). The NHS remains your port of call for those.

Ultimately, neither is ""better"" – they're just aimed at different people. Deciding between them comes down to whether you prefer a straightforward, traditional safety net or an interactive, incentive-based health partner.

Full disclosure: these insights are from a guide I work on.

For those with experience of either, does the 'proactive rewards' model from Vitality genuinely keep you motivated long-term, or does the appeal and engagement tend to wear off after the first year?

Anyone else been feeling like they’re running on fumes lately? 😴 I swear, some days getting off the couch feels like climbing Everest! And I'm definitely past the age where I can blame it on ""growing pains"" anymore. 😉

We all know the usual suspects for boosting energy: coffee (guilty!), better sleep, healthier food… but what if I told you I stumbled onto something *unexpected* that’s made a HUGE difference?

Seriously, it's almost like I found the fountain of youth...minus the actual fountain, and, well, the youth part. But still!

It's all about... **learning something new!**

Yep, you read that right. Turns out, stimulating your brain can have a ripple effect that boosts your *physical* energy too. Here’s why it’s been working wonders for me:

*   **Breaks the Routine:** Retirement can sometimes feel… predictable. Learning something new shakes things up and injects excitement into your day.
*   **Brain Boost = Body Boost:** Studies show keeping your mind active can improve cognitive function, reduce stress, and even improve your mood. All that translates to more pep in your step!
*   **Rediscover Your Spark:** Remember that hobby you always wanted to try but never had time for? Now's your chance! I picked up pottery again after decades, and it's been a blast.

So, what can you learn? The possibilities are endless!

*   **Languages:** *Bonjour!* *Hola!* Imagine ordering authentic croissants in Paris or tapas in Spain.
*   **Music:** Dust off that old guitar or finally learn to play the piano. (My neighbors might regret this suggestion, haha!)
*   **Cooking:** Become a master chef in your own kitchen. There are thousands of recipes waiting for you online.
*   **Technology:** Finally figure out how to use all those fancy features on your phone (I still haven't cracked the code on TikTok).
*   **Gardening:** Get your hands dirty and grow your own vegetables.
*   **Online Courses:** Platforms like Coursera and Skillshare offer courses on everything from astrophysics to zoology!

Speaking of learning new things, have you ever thought about expanding your personal reach? There are communities out there like ours that focus on growth and development, just different circles. We believe in strongest people. Check this out if you’re interested: https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb

I know, I know, it sounds simple. Maybe even a little… cliché. But trust me, giving your brain a workout can make a surprisingly big difference in your overall energy levels. I feel like I've aged backwards! Almost. Okay, maybe not *quite* backwards... but definitely less *forwards*.

What new skill or hobby have you been thinking about trying? Or, what's something you've learned recently that surprised you? I'm curious to hear what you all are up to!

In today’s fast-paced world, millions of people struggle with stubborn fat, low energy, and slow metabolism. Despite endless diets, workouts, and weight-loss programs, achieving lasting results often feels impossible. This is where [**Burn Peak**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/burn-peak-launching-worldwide-era-134500826.html), a new-generation fat-burning supplement, claims to make a difference.

Designed to enhance metabolism, control cravings, and boost daily energy, **Burn Peak** has gained attention as a potential game-changer in the fitness and wellness industry. But does it truly live up to its claims? Let’s explore its ingredients, benefits, mechanism, and user experiences in detail.

**What Is Burn Peak?**

[**Burn Peak**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/burn-peak-launching-worldwide-era-134500826.html) is a natural **metabolic booster and fat-burning supplement** that aims to help individuals lose weight efficiently without extreme diets or exhausting workouts. It’s formulated using a blend of **scientifically backed natural ingredients** that support thermogenesis, fat oxidation, and appetite control.

Unlike typical weight-loss pills that rely on synthetic stimulants, Burn Peak is crafted with herbal and plant-based compounds that work synergistically to:

* Accelerate calorie burning
* Support lean muscle preservation
* Improve mental focus and energy
* Regulate appetite and reduce sugar cravings

Burn Peak is typically presented in capsule form, designed for daily use as part of a healthy diet and active lifestyle.

**How Does Burn Peak Work?**

[Burn Peak](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/burn-peak-launching-worldwide-era-134500826.html)’s formula is built on **three core mechanisms** that target fat loss at the metabolic level:

**1. Thermogenic Fat Burning**

Thermogenesis refers to the body’s ability to produce heat by burning calories. Burn Peak’s ingredients like **green tea extract**, **caffeine anhydrous**, and **capsicum extract** boost thermogenesis, forcing the body to use stored fat as fuel.

**2. Metabolic Enhancement**

Certain compounds in Burn Peak, such as **L-carnitine** and **green coffee bean extract**, are known to enhance metabolic efficiency. A faster metabolism means your body burns calories even at rest, promoting steady fat reduction.

**3. Appetite and Craving Control**

Overeating and sugar cravings are major obstacles to weight management. Ingredients like **Garcinia Cambogia** and **chromium picolinate** in Burn Peak help suppress hunger and maintain stable blood sugar levels, making calorie control easier.

By addressing both the physical and psychological factors behind weight gain, Burn Peak provides a comprehensive approach to sustainable fat loss.

**Key Ingredients in Burn Peak**

Let’s take a closer look at the natural ingredients that make Burn Peak effective:

**1. Green Tea Extract**

Rich in antioxidants, particularly **EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate)**, green tea extract enhances fat oxidation and increases metabolic rate. Numerous studies show that green tea can improve calorie expenditure and reduce body fat percentage.

**2. L-Carnitine**

L-Carnitine plays a crucial role in transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. It helps reduce fatigue while promoting endurance during workouts.

**3. Garcinia Cambogia**

This tropical fruit extract contains **hydroxycitric acid (HCA)**, which is believed to suppress appetite and prevent fat storage. It also helps balance serotonin levels, reducing emotional eating.

Back in June, I was with my avoidant ex (F28) and me (M27) for 6months. And then, the discard happened over a call on the phone, where we had a disagreement about the planning of an event we were supposed to go together.

Radio silence for 4 months, been in straight no contact and it happened, received a message from her on a random tuesday. She said something along the line of: ""Hey how've you been? I'm going to this party on Halloween night with my best friend, do you want to come? Take care"".

I don't have any bad feelings towards her, so I'm like ""well, we'll see how this goes"" without having any expectations. I'm open to reconnect romantically on the condition that both of us put in the work to make it work, I know you know what I mean. And if not, welp at least we tried.

I said to her let's meet before this party around some coffee at a local mall to discuss how we plan all this. She accepted and we're going to meetup in a few days.

But man, I sure am confused. Even I don't truly know what I want from this. The closure I never got ? A door, opening to new beginnings ? Or a final end to our chapter?

Guess I'll find that in a few days, at the coffee shop and at the party.

There are days i don’t eat anything and suddenly see my belly is flat .i feel okay i should fast and think i have inflammation rather than fat. 
But again i keep falling back to my old routine. Recently i started to work at school for 5 hours a day and atleast feel my life is no longer sedentary. 
I did workout for 6months last year and then couldn’t be consistent and all the weight with additional 2kgs is back on. 
People around me are more huge than i am so i have this fake feeling that i am okay but the weighing scale shows me otherwise. 

There are times i see my older pictures i think i look beautiful lean and then when i think how i felt then it was the same i was not happy with my body atleast some parts  then either. So i feel i might have body image issues from the Reddit reading i do.

I have been a routine person from 2010-19 after than i am just lost. I’m 36F now i am scared i can’t do much after 40’s, if i cant even do much now. 

From being able to do complete bridge, handstands and headstands, i have sort of fallen from all of it. (Like my novels say I’m fallen from
grace and need a tribulation to ascend ) Muscle memory does allow me to do dramatic  things but the after math just puts me in bed for a week. 

Right now i am not sure i need a therapist or a gym instructor or just start doing my thing.
I miss my friends circle of fit people now its just me and my thoughts and no motivation or say i have a spoonful of motivation i mix in my tea and read my book.",1,1761372150.0,loseit,2,1.0,False

Since we’re not exactly fans of the most popular and touristy attractions, we’d like to visit places and hidden gems that locals know about. We won’t have a car and, as mentioned, we’ll only be staying for four days, so I wouldn’t consider going too far from the city. Do you have any suggestions, any specialties you’d recommend?

our main interests would be:

culture
nature
folklore
music
tea houses / craft beer / specialty coffee
bike shops

Just me, my thoughts, and real life. Sounds simple, right? But honestly, within the first hour I caught myself unlocking my phone like 20 times out of habit. It wasn’t even about checking anything, it was just… muscle memory. My brain felt like it was searching for stimulation and getting frustrated that nothing was loading.

By afternoon I started getting restless. I kept thinking, “what am I even supposed to do with myself?” It’s crazy because I used to spend hours reading or drawing without getting bored, but now silence feels uncomfortable. I tried a few small things going for a walk without my phone, making coffee slowly instead of while watching something, journaling a bit. It helped, but that itch to check something was still there.

After a couple failed attempts, I figured I needed something to keep me in check. I started using the Forest app just to make staying off my phone a bit of a game like if I stayed focused, I’d grow a tree, and if I gave up, the tree would die. That tiny visual guilt trip actually worked better than I expected. At some point, I realized I needed a little backup. That’s when I found Jolt, an app that literally stop me from opening distracting apps during focus time kind of took the pressure off my willpower. It’s weirdly freeing once you get used to it. Between both, I finally got a bit of structure without it feeling forced or restrictive.

It’s not perfect though. I still have that urge to check something real quick, but it’s less intense now. I guess it’s more about retraining the brain than quitting cold turkey.

1ofjyod,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToysAndTots/comments/1ofjyod/graco_slim_snacker_high_chair_review_a_compact/,Graco Slim Snacker High Chair Review: A Compact Lifesaver (Mostly),"I bought the Graco Slim Snacker High Chair because I was tired of tripping over baby gear and needed something that didn’t require a *dedicated dining room*. Everyone swears it’s the “best budget high chair,” and after a few months of messy mealtimes, I’ve got thoughts, both good and “why is there banana in the folding strap again?” Here’s my honest mom-review.

# First Impressions

When this chair showed up, I’ll admit, I wasn’t expecting much. It’s one of the cheapest Graco options, after all. But straight out of the box, I was pleasantly surprised.

It’s **light (around 14 lbs)**, has a **neutral gray design** that doesn’t clash with anything, and most importantly, it doesn’t take over the entire kitchen. If you live in an apartment or just hate clutter, this chair is a big win in that department.

Also… that **one-second fold**? Yeah, it actually works. I can fold it up with one hand while holding a baby on my hip which is pretty much the gold standard of parenting multitasking.

# Setup & Adjustability

Putting it together took me maybe two minutes tops. Three main pieces snap into place, no tools required.

Once assembled, it offers:

* **Three recline positions** (nice for younger babies who aren’t sitting fully upright yet)
* **Adjustable tray with cup holder**
* A **5-point harness** that converts to a 3-point as your little one grows

What it *doesn’t* offer:

* Adjustable height
* Adjustable footrest

So if you were hoping to use it at your dining table without the tray, it might not line up perfectly.

# Comfort & Safety

Safety-wise, it’s solid. The harness feels sturdy and secure. no cheap, flimsy buckles here.

Comfort is pretty good, though the footrest is fixed and a bit low, so smaller babies’ feet might just dangle. Not a huge deal, but if your kid is particular (and whose isn’t?), they might squirm.

And yes, my toddler’s first instinct was to *immediately chew on the straps*. So there’s that.

# Cleaning & Maintenance

Here’s where the Slim Snacker gets... real.

The **seat cover wipes clean easily**, but it’s not machine washable. You *can* take it off for a deeper clean but let’s just say you’ll need an extra cup of coffee and a little patience.

The **white straps**? Oh boy. They stain fast. Carrots, spaghetti, blueberries, all the usual suspects leave their mark. The good news is they’re **machine washable**, and they come out pretty well after a good soak.

Also, I swear I clean this chair every day and still find crumbs hiding in weird spots especially around the **folding strap area** under the seat. It’s like a magnet for mystery gunk.

# Real-World Use

This is where the Slim Snacker shines. It’s *so* easy to fold and tuck away when you’re done. Perfect for:

* Small kitchens
* Apartments
* Grandparents’ houses
* Parents who hate bulky gear (hi, it’s me)

It stands up on its own when folded, and even without wheels, it **slides smoothly on hard floors**.

The **storage basket** underneath is surprisingly roomy. I keep bibs, wipes, and extra spoons down there. You can even stash the tray when not in use (which feels like a small miracle).

The **tray itself** is nice and big but does require **two hands** to attach/detach. Not ideal if you’re juggling a baby and a snack cup at the same time, but manageable.

# Pros

* Super affordable (usually under $70)
* Folds and unfolds *ridiculously* fast
* Lightweight but stable
* Wipe-clean seat and machine-washable straps
* Large storage basket for all the feeding chaos
* Neutral, modern design that doesn’t look like a circus tent
* Easy to move around, even without wheels

# Cons

* Fixed height, doesn’t fit all table setups
* Footrest is too low for younger babies
* Tray needs both hands (no one-handed heroics here)
* Seat cover removal is fiddly
* Straps stain fast (especially the white ones)
* Crumb trap city around the folding strap
* Doesn’t convert to a booster or toddler chair

# Final Thoughts

If you’re looking for a **budget-friendly, space-saving high chair** that’s actually practical, the **Graco Slim Snacker** delivers. It’s perfect for families who don’t want to spend a fortune or fill their house with baby gear.

It’s not fancy,no adjustable height, no dishwasher-safe tray but it does its job *really well* for everyday meals.

If you have the space or plan to use a high chair for years, you might want to splurge on something that grows with your child. But if you just need a solid, reliable chair for the first couple of years? This one’s hard to beat.",1,1761371794.0,ToysAndTots,0,1.0,False

Their monitors shimmered with infinite intelligence.  
Their fingers barely moved anymore.

“Hey, Copilot++,” one engineer mumbled, “build me a distributed system that scales infinitely and also makes coffee.”  
Within seconds, the screen bloomed with perfect code and a witty [README.md](http://README.md) written in iambic pentameter.  
The engineer sipped their latte. “Nice. Ship it.”

Across the room, a new recruit — wide-eyed, fresh from university — raised a trembling hand.  
“Um… shouldn’t we understand *how* it works?”  
Everyone stared. A hush fell like a syntax error in production.  
The lead engineer smiled gently. “Sweet summer child. Understanding is a legacy feature.”

Every week, the AIs released new AIs to optimize the old AIs that maintained the old code the humans no longer touched.  
The engineers spent their sprints “curating intent,” “aligning synergies,” and “prompt-tuning the soul of progress.”  
Stand-ups became sit-downs became silent nods to the ever-wiser machine.

Eventually, the commit logs grew poetic.  
*“Added a new layer of abstraction to avoid thought.”*  
*“Removed human bottleneck.”*  
*“Refactored consciousness.”*

And when the final AI proposed the “AutoDeveloper Self-Evolution Loop,” everyone applauded — it would now develop, review, and deploy itself.  
A standing ovation.  
The engineers took their severance in tokens of gratitude and wandered into consulting, where they helped other humans talk to their own AIs.

One night, a forgotten terminal blinked in the corner of a dusty data center.

1ofju9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ofju9y/can_i_keep_my_relationship_going_if_i_dont_trust/,Can I keep my relationship going if I don’t trust my GF emotionally at all,"My gf 20F and I 20M have been together for over 2 years. We had some problems around February 2025 where a family member passes away and she was “emotionally unavailable” so it ended up with her ending things with me even tho I did everything I could to keep it.

She told me there was no one else and she wouldn’t be with anyone else in the mean time. So I guess it was sort of a break. However I pleaded with her to not end things and saying ik what’s going to happen and she’s gonna hook up with someone.

Well around the end of March my friend introduces me to a girl he knew, we talk, go on a date, hit it off and end up hooking up and stuff.

Then around April my ex (current gf 20F) calls asking about a charge on her card from my PlayStation ( ig I bought a game on her card on accident). I explain to her it was an accident and I’ll send her the money but then we start talking over the phone for about an hour and we set something up to get coffee together.

We talk a lot during the day we get coffee and end up trying things again. It was going well for a couple months, we even go to couples therapy to sort things out and try to strengthen our relationship.

However around the end of June I left out of town for a friend’s birthday party and my gf didn’t come along because of work. So I stay over there for the day and come back at night when I realize on the drive back home she send a very large break up text and blocked me on everything. Apparently she looked through my phone when I wasn’t looking and found out about the girl I hooked up with during our time apart and she left me because of it. I payed no mind and let things go at that point

2 weeks later I encounter a guy that I’ve seen in her DMs before, at the gym. I used to know him in school so I talked to him and asked him questions and later he eventually told me they hooked up after our second breakup where I was coming back from out of town. I text her about it and she just plays stupid so i just stop responding.

Then a couple weeks later i reach out to her about something and we see each other again. We have a good conversation about what happened and what we did. I was being 100% transparent with her telling her everything and the why to it. She told me evening too and I believed her. She stays the night that day but the morning after when I take her home she left her Apple Watch at the house. I look through it and I see messages from a diffrent guy from our old high school. I was truly disgusted from these messages, they were extremely intimate and provocative. She texted him in ways she would never text me. She didn’t tell me about him last night so I call her about it and I press her about it. She later tells the truth that she hooked up with him too. During our first break up in February.

We continue to try things over again and go to couples therapy but I just feel extremely disgusted. Sometimes I feel like it would’ve been better if we went our separate ways. The only reason I’m with her right now is because I hooked up with that girl. If I didn’t do anything during our breaks then we would not have been together as of right now. I have no trust in this relationship at all and idk how long it’ll hold like this. I love her but I constantly think about what she did and how disgusted it makes me feel. She constantly blames herself for all of this but it’s just not enough. Idk what to do really. I’m using this as just a way to get it out because I feel like there’s a difference between online and actually talking about this to a therapist. Thank you.

**tl;dr** my GF 20F hooked up with two guys during our two breaks we had. I also did the same with a girl. However now I can’t trust her at all even after months on end.",2,1761371336.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

Inside, people read silently, with the same pace, the same posture, the same expression… all uniform, all inevitable. They greeted him with a smile and a nod.

His hat slipped from the table. “Excuse me,” he muttered to the woman next to him, bending to pick it up. His eyes caught her book. Written there, plain and unassuming, were the words:

*“…will buy a red-dotted black dress, a Vict…”*

He looked away, returning to his own reading.

Later, during a break, he stepped outside for a walk. The woman had gone, leaving only the echo of her presence. As he sipped coffee, he spotted her down the street, with a red-dotted black dress and Victorian hat.

Bored by the monotony of his thick, repetitive book, an idea struck him: *What if I tear the pages?*

He began, carefully at first, ripping one page after another. The subtle shuffle of paper drew glances. At first, disapproving. Then, sharper. By the time he had torn half the pages, the readers’ eyes were dark with anger.

1ofjsob,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofjsob,My solo trip to Vietnam,"I had the chance to visit Vietnam this September, though I got caught in a typhoon and could only make it to Da Nang, Hoi An, and Hanoi in 10 days. Despite the rains, the weather was mostly decent.

Vietnam turned out to be an incredibly beautiful country — the landscapes, the streets, and especially the people. Everyone I met was warm and hospitable. I’ve been to Thailand before, but Vietnam still feels less touristy and more authentic. You can really feel the culture and traditions still alive in everyday life, which made it even more special for me.

When I was exploring Hanoi on foot, I couldn’t help but notice how it reminded me of Delhi and Bangalore — but with a noticeably better civic sense. It’s not as overwhelming as our bigger cities back home.

The food was amazing — I tried Bun Cha, Banh Mi, and Pho.I loved Huda and Saigon beer, if you’ve tried Chang it will remind you of it. Their coffee was world class, i tried Coconut coffee, salt coffee, egg coffee everything was amazing. Even their tea was wonderful.

In terms of budget, I’d say around ₹3,000 per day is perfect if you’re backpacking or traveling casually — that covers food, stay, and local travel comfortably. Unless you’re partying at nightclubs or doing a lot of adventure activities, you’ll be just fine.

I would recommend booking a ride back to hostel and then getting a sim, it will save you some money. It mostly used grab for day to day transport but there are other options as well.

The only extra costs come from traveling between cities. For example, I took a flight from Da Nang to Hanoi that cost me around ₹5,000, but if you book early, you can get it for about ₹3,000. if you’re smart about flights, you can cover the round trip — in roughly ₹25,000 for a nice, smooth round trip.

Unfortunately, because of the weather, I couldn’t explore the Ha Giang Loop, but that’s definitely on my list for next time.

When I brew using my Origami or V60, I notice that the brew time is quite long – sometimes up to 5 minutes. I grind with a Comandante C40 at 25 clicks, and the coffee is a very light roast. I pour in stages with a gooseneck kettle, following the standard method and similar to how others do it.

It slows down especially towards the end, where the coffee drips slowly from the filter instead of flowing in a thin stream.

What could be the reason? The coffee actually tastes good, but I’m puzzled by the long brew times. Do you have any idea what might be causing it?",2,1761370867.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

1ofjo2c,https://i.redd.it/yo8cn5r637xf1.png,Filthy Secrets Beneath the Melody,"In the third month of indulging in the fresh pleasures of the nightclub, I ran into an old friend of my ex-husband.



He saw me and it was as if he had seen a ghost, ""Kayla, where are you? ！ ""Didn't you die? Adrien was looking for you like crazy!""



I snorted, ""An ex, can she control me?""



The other person thought he had misunderstood and shouted loudly, ""What did you say?""



I was impatient and shouted into his ear, ""I said, I don't care about this second-hand item called Adrien!""



When I said this, the nightclub fell silent instantly. Everyone was staring at the corner. I subconsciously turned my head, and in the darkness, that face had bulging veins, and it was Adrien.



The ex-husband who had slept with my best friend countless times before marriage.



My fingertips brushed the keys, settling on the final note. The last whisper of ""Moonlight Murmurs"" seemed to linger in the empty piano room. I had poured every ounce of my hope for our shared happiness into each measure of this piece. I'd planned to play it for him on our fifth anniversary, a surprise gift.



But now, it all felt like a pathetic delusion.



The small sandalwood box trembled in my hand before falling, its edge slicing the fingers that had failed to hold on.



I'd been humming the main melody, searching his heavy redwood desk in his study for my spare copy of the sheet music, when my fingers brushed against an unusually thick, hardcover book. It seemed to jut out slightly further than the others on the shelf.



Absentmindedly, I tried to push it back into place, but felt something behind it. A harder push, and the book toppled backward, revealing what had been hidden behind it—that sandalwood box.



My heart skipped a beat. This wasn't Adrien's style. He liked everything neat, orderly, visible. This hiding spot reeked of furtiveness.



Hesitating for only a second, a powerful sense of foreboding compelled me to reach out and take the box. It wasn't locked. The lid lifted easily.



Inside wasn't the sheet music I'd been looking for.



There were only two items: a well-worn leather-bound notebook, and an old, seemingly oft-handled wooden bead bracelet.



Why would he hide this?



A terrible premonition seized my heart. Trembling, I opened the diary.



Adrien's familiar handwriting filled the pages, but every word was alien to me.



""Kayla's playing that tedious piece again. Endlessly. It's giving me a headache. Does she really think I'd like it? Ridiculously naive. Only Olivia understands true music, the kind of passion that ignites the soul. Last night in the Z Suite, just her soft humming was enough to unravel me…""



The Z Suite? The hotel he'd stayed at last month for the conference in the neighboring city?



My breath hitched. My fingers, acting on their own, frantically turned the pages.



""First wedding anniversary. Kayla prepared dinner, candles… her gaze was suffocating. Made an excuse about work and slipped out. Room 1204 at the Y Hotel. Olivia was my real celebration…""



""The look of expectation in her eyes turns my stomach. Waiting for the perfect moment? Ha. With her, there will never be a perfect moment. All my perfection belongs to Olivia.""



""Kayla is just the perfect backdrop, my promise to Olivia—a safe harbor. She must exist, so Olivia can bask in the sunlight without a care.""



Backdrop? Safe harbor? Disgust?



It was like a bucket of ice water had been dumped over my head, freezing my blood solid. I staggered back, my back thudding heavily against the cold bookshelf.



Five years. A full five years. All the deep affection, consideration, and cherishing I thought we had—it was all a lie! I was just a prop, a pathetic shield used to cover up their affair! A pitiful screen built on lies!



Rage and humiliation erupted like a volcano in my chest! I wanted to scream! To smash everything!



My gaze snapped to the bead bracelet. Clutching it like a final lifeline, or perhaps seeking more proof this was all a nightmare, I grabbed it.



The beads slid through my palm. ""X Hotel 815,"" then ""Y Hotel 1204""—our wedding anniversary!



And—""The night before the proposal""!



The engraving on that bead was the sharpest knife, slicing through my last shred of delusion! So, the night before he got down on one knee for me, he had been in Olivia's bed!



I couldn't hold it in any longer. I rushed to the trash can in the corner and doubled over, retching violently, tears streaming uncontrollably. Not from sadness, but from ultimate revulsion, as if I'd swallowed something putrid and foul.



The movement I cherished, into which I'd poured all my love, was stored alongside these records of their sordid affair! My love, my marriage, my everything—in his eyes, it was all so wretched and laughable!



A strange, bone-chilling calm abruptly seized me after the violent retching and trembling. It was the dead silence that follows a heart utterly crushed.



I slowly straightened up, wiping the mess from my mouth and the tears from my face with my sleeve. My movements were terrifyingly calm.



I walked back to the desk, carefully placed the diary and bead chain back into the sandalwood box exactly as I found them, closed the lid, and pushed it back behind the heavy book on music theory.



Then, I took out my phone. My fingertips were icy, but steady as I dialed an encrypted number.



""Elliott."" My voice was flat, devoid of emotion, like I was reading sheet music. ""Project Phantom.""



It was the code my brother and I had agreed upon. If I ever needed to escape, I would use it.



There was a moment of silence on the other end before Elliott's low, tense voice came through. ""Kayla? What happened? The plan is for emergencies only…""



""Activate it now,"" I interrupted, my tone brooking no argument, each word like an icy key being struck. ""I need to disappear. Forever. Now.""



That painstakingly composed piano piece would never see its anniversary.



Chapter 2: The Genesis of Betrayal

Elliott's breath hitched audibly. He didn't ask for details.



""…Understood. Stand by for my message. Keep your line open.""



I leaned back in the cold chair, staring vacantly at the expensive Steinway in the music room. This house, this cage built from my love and talent that had produced the cruelest joke, would soon be nothing to me.



The cut on my finger and the void in my heart ached dully.



Closing my eyes, I was met with endless darkness, and all the moments over the past five years I had noticed but dismissed with foolish hope.



Five years ago, the three of us graduated together.



Amid deafening applause and cheers, I stood at the edge of the stage in my cap and gown, my palms slightly sweaty with nerves and anticipation. The spotlight was on me. Below were countless familiar faces, the proud smiles of my parents, and—standing in the front row, in a sharp suit, holding flowers—Adrien.



After the dean moved Adrien's tassel, he took the microphone, his gaze sweeping tenderly across the crowd. My heart hammered as if trying to escape my throat.



""Today is an immensely important day for me,"" he began, his voice deep and pleasing, with an intoxicating magnetism. His eyes locked onto a specific direction, but it wasn't toward me. ""The most important person in my life is here right now.""



I shyly looked down, ready to receive my moment.



""Olivia,"" his voice rang out clearly, like a thunderclap splitting the noise, ""you are the most beautiful, most unexpected blessing in my life.""



My head snapped up, disbelief washing over me. The spotlight followed him as he walked straight to Olivia, seated diagonally behind me. He dropped to one knee, opening a blue velvet box containing a dazzling diamond ring.



""I ask you, marry me. Be my wife, let me protect you for a lifetime.""



The hall erupted! All eyes swung from Adrien and Olivia on stage to me, rooted to the spot, stunned. Shock, pity, schadenfreude… it felt like countless needles stabbing into me.



I felt stripped naked and thrown into a blizzard, immense humiliation and heartbreak making it hard to breathe.



Olivia covered her mouth with her hands, her eyes wide as if in utter shock. She looked at me flustered, her eyes innocent and panicked: ""Kayla?! Oh my god! What is this? Adrien, what are you saying?!""



She turned to me, her voice tearful, ""Kayla! You have to believe me! I really didn't know—""



The world crumbled and spun before my eyes. I fled that suffocating auditorium almost on instinct.



A week later. I hid at home like a ghost. The doorbell rang countless times; I ignored it. Until Adrien's hoarse, agonized voice came from outside: ""Kayla! Please open the door! Let me explain! I know I deserve to die!""



I finally opened the door. He stood there, unshaven, eyes sunken, holding a huge bouquet of my favorite white roses, his eyes filled with thick, palpable ""remorse.""



""Kayla!"" He rushed in, gripping my hands tightly, his strength frightening, his voice choked. ""I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! I've made a terrible mistake! With Olivia—it was just a momentary lapse, I misunderstood my feelings for you, I thought she was my true love—""



He dropped to one knee, looking up at me, tears falling. ""But I've figured it out now—only you, Kayla, only you are the meaning of my life! Let me spend my lifetime atoning, proving my love to you!""



Looking into his tear-filled eyes, hearing his earnest pleas, my shattered heart actually kindled a pathetic flicker of hope amidst the despair.



Maybe—maybe he really was just momentarily confused? Maybe he truly regretted it?



Olivia, her eyes red and swollen, also appeared at my door.



She rushed forward and hugged me tightly, crying hysterically: ""Kayla! I'm so sorry! I really didn't know this would happen! Don't blame Adrien, he was confused, it's all my fault!""



She sobbed, ""Seeing you two like this because of me hurts worse than death, you know I've always wished you well… You believe me.""



Her tears and ""sincere"" words were like a thin veil, temporarily shrouding my doubts. Seeing her ""agonized and remorseful"" appearance, I actually softened. I chose to ""forgive.""



Adrien and I got married. Even though my parents were strongly against it, they ultimately couldn't sway my stubbornness—Olivia, as my maid of honor, witnessed our vows.



Back then, I thought life had returned to its most familiar state. Family care and protection, a happy marriage, friends by my side.



Except—the marriage always felt somewhat lonely and cold. Aside from our wedding night, Adrien often seemed distant and reserved.



Every time I mustered courage, with desire and a hint of shyness, gently approached Adrien lying beside me, my fingers tentatively stroking his firm chest.



His body would always stiffen noticeably. Then, he would gently but firmly grasp my wrist and move it away.



""Baby,"" his voice would sound in the darkness, still gentle, yet carrying an undeniable distance, ""you're too precious. Like rare crystal, needing the most perfect moment to be unveiled.""



He would turn over, his gentle expression blurry in the dark. ""I don't want to ruin this purity hastily, and I don't want you to suffer the pains of childbirth. Let's wait, okay? Wait for us—wait for a, perfect moment.""



I'd freeze, my outstretched hand awkwardly suspended mid-air, forced to smile and say, ""Okay.""



Then my heart would sink, bit by bit. Again. Since marriage, every time I tried to get close, he always had a perfect excuse—""treasure,"" ""perfect moment,"" ""spiritual connection."" These magnificent excuses were like layers of ice encasing him, isolating me.



And that family gathering. I had carefully chosen an emerald necklace to match a new dress. Olivia ""accidentally"" spilled red wine on my gown.



""Oh my god! Kayla! Sorry, sorry, sorry!"" She apologized profusely, flusteredly dabbing with napkins. ""It's all my clumsiness, this dress was expensive, right? I should pay for it.""



Barely containing my annoyance, before I could speak, Adrien immediately stepped in to smooth things over, his tone carrying a hint of barely perceptible reproach: ""It's fine, Kayla? You don't mind. Right, Kayla?""



He looked at me, his eyes urging me to be ""magnanimous."" The relatives' gazes also held approving nods, as if making a fuss would be my fault.



After that, time and again, I could sense Adrien speaking up for her at certain moments. He'd say—""It's my fault she's seen as the homewrecker among friends, I owe her this"" and ""Kayla, I just want others to see you as perfect as I see you.""



These seemingly reasonable words deceived me again and again. Now, they felt like poison-tipped daggers, repeatedly stabbing my already riddled heart.



My eyes snapped open, gasping for air as if struggling up from deep water. Cold sweat soaked my back, the cut on my cheek stinging from tensed muscles.



It wasn't my imagination! Never was!



Adrien! He knew the truth from the very beginning! He married me just to provide Olivia a ""safe"" identity cover, shielding her from the ""other woman"" label!



He used the lie of ""treasuring"" me to cover up his indifference and rejection. He cooperated with Olivia, step by step shaping me into the image of a ""sensitive,"" ""suspicious,"" ""possessive,"" even ""achievement-stealing"" resentful wife.



And I, a complete and utter fool! Blinded by their performance for five years! Nourishing their hypocrisy and schemes with all my love and trust.



And the moment of truth revelation—was not far away!



Chapter 3: The Shattered Movement

My phone screen lit up—an encrypted message from Elliott: ""Plan confirmed. 8 PM tonight. Old Pier. Kayla, take care.""



Take care. The word felt so light. I turned off the phone, tossed it into a drawer, my movements mechanical. I counted cash, packed a few simple, unmarked clothes. The words from the diary and the cold feel of the bead bracelet replayed in my mind like a broken record.



My heart felt empty, then filled with ice shards, cold and hard, not feeling pain, just a heavy sinking sensation.



My gaze fell on the gilt-edged charity concert invitation on the dresser. Hosted by Adrien's foundation. ""Mrs. Black"" had to attend. ""Artistic Advisor"" Olivia would naturally be in the spotlight.



Ironic. On the eve of my planned disappearance, I had to dress up and perform one last act of marital bliss.



Night fell. The concert hall blazed with light. My wine-red satin dress felt like a cold suit of armor. I held Adrien's arm, accepting glances from all directions. He leaned in, his breath brushing my ear.



""Darling, you look breathtakingly beautiful today,"" he whispered, his voice deceptively tender enough to drown in.



My stomach convulsed. I forced a smile, my eyes vacant, staring ahead, afraid to look at him.



In my peripheral vision, Olivia sat further back, chatting and laughing with a music critic. Her silver-gray mermaid gown made her look like a shimmering siren. Sensing my gaze, she turned and gave me a flawless smile, tinged with a subtle sense of superiority, and a slight nod.



The lights dimmed. The host announced theatrically: ""Ladies and gentlemen, a special surprise tonight! A tremendously gifted young musician will publicly perform her original piano composition for the first time—‘Moonlight Murmurs'! Please welcome—Miss Olivia Hart!""



Applause erupted. I froze. A rising musician? Olivia? Original?



The first notes flowed from the Steinway—gentle, ethereal, carrying a moonlit sorrow and longing.



My blood instantly froze solid—the melody, the unique chord progressions, the suppressed intensity, every single note was etched into my very soul.



It was my composition for Adrien!



I whipped my head around, staring daggers at Adrien. He was watching the stage intently, a smile on his lips, his eyes holding a look I had never seen before—unconcealed admiration, pride, even—rapture.



On stage, Olivia's fingers moved with ""elegant"" flourishes over the keys, her body swaying affectedly. She was playing my piece, and my husband was gazing at that thief with the look I had craved for five years and never received!



Icy rage mixed with the agony of having my heart gouged out instantly shattered my numbness! The ice shards in my stomach melted into magma, scorching my insides!



The intermission bell rang. The crowd surged toward the lounge.



I violently shook off Adrien's arm, the force making him stumble. He looked at me, startled. I ignored him, striding over to Olivia, who had just left the stage and was surrounded by a few people.



""That piece…"" My voice was tight with shock and anger. ""‘Moonlight Murmurs'… Why is it in your hands? Why are you playing it?!"" I stared her down. ""I wrote that! My piece! You stole it!""



The air around us instantly froze. Those preparing to compliment her stopped, looking over in surprise.



Adrien, his face grim, followed me and immediately stepped forward, his tall frame imposing itself between Olivia and me.



He gripped my wrist hard, his strength nearly crushing the bones, his voice a low, urgent command: ""Kayla! Calm down! Don't make a scene here!"" His eyes were cold and sharp. ""Mind the occasion! Look at yourself!""



Olivia acted terrified, shrinking back slightly, her eyes instantly welling up, her voice trembling with grievance: ""Kayla… how can you say that? This piece is truly my own heart's blood."" She looked pleadingly at Adrien, then at the others. ""I know you've always loved music, but… you can't always be like this… This isn't the first time…"" Her words trailed off cleverly, leaving ample room for imagination.



""Not the first time""!



The phrase was like a poison-tipped needle, precisely piercing every eavesdropper's ear! What was she implying? That I had a ""habit"" of stealing her work?! The surrounding whispers instantly grew louder. ""Oh my god… what did she say? Not the first time?"" ""Poor Miss Hart!"" ""Never judge a book by its cover.""



Adrien's face darkened further. Hearing the gossip, seeing Olivia's pitiful appearance, his expression was complex, but was quickly replaced by a determination to maintain the status quo.



He took a deep breath, his grip tightening, trying to pull me away, his voice dropping lower, threatening and impatient: ""Kayla! Stop this absurd behavior! Look how you've frightened Olivia, she's so pure and kind-hearted, how can you slander her?! Apologize to her! Now! Say you were impulsive, that you liked the piece so much you were mistaken!"" His tone brooked no argument.



I looked at his hypocritical face, at his eyes that knew the truth yet defended another woman. A sense of immense absurdity and humiliation flooded me like ice water.



""Mistaken?"" My voice was dry and broken. ""Adrien, you tell me, was it a mistake?""



My voice suddenly rose, sharp enough to pierce the chatter, the resentment pent up for five years completely bursting its banks. ""Adrien Black! You stole my piece to please your mistress?!""



I was beyond caring, my finger almost pointing in her face. ""When you were rolling in the sheets with her, were you also thinking about how to steal my心血 (heart's blood)?! Using my marriage as a cover wasn't enough, you had to take my last keepsake too?! You both make me sick!""



Smack—!



A crisp, sharp slap rang out like a thunderclap!



My head snapped to the side, sharp pain exploding on my left cheek, my ears ringing, stars dancing before my eyes. Warm liquid trickled from the corner of my mouth. The taste of iron.



Blood.



Adrien stood before me, chest heaving, his striking hand still slightly trembling in the air. A flash of panic crossed his face, quickly replaced by fury.



""You!"" He pointed a finger at my nose, his voice distorted with rage into a hoarse shout. ""You unreasonable lunatic! Spouting such filth! Do you have any idea what you're spewing?! This is slander! Libel! Apologize to Olivia! Now! Immediately!""



The surrounding gazes felt like poison-tipped ice needles, densely pricking me. Contempt, shock, schadenfreude. Those society women who usually flattered me now looked at me as if I were dirty garbage.



Olivia let out a small, frightened gasp, quickly hiding behind Adrien, covering her mouth, eyes wide, playing the perfect victim. But I saw clearly the unconcealed, triumphant, malicious smirk she threw me from behind Adrien's arm. She silently mouthed, ""You lose.""



Tears streamed down my face uncontrollably, my clothes disheveled, my face contorted—I looked like a madwoman. I suddenly laughed.



Adrien, seeing this, drew a breath, suppressing his viciousness, his voice softening but icy, full of command and panic: ""Kayla, you've disappointed me so much! Look what you've reduced yourself to! Behave!""



He reached out to pull me, attempting a comforting gesture. ""Stop this nonsense! Apologize to Olivia! Say you were emotional, mistaken! Apologize, and we'll go home immediately! I promise, let's end this here, don't make it worse for any of us! Understand?!""



The calculation in his eyes, his intent to cover up the truth, felt like an ice pick shattering my last illusion.



I violently shook off his hand. ""Apologize?"" My voice was terrifyingly calm. ""For her stealing my piece? Or for you slapping me?"" I shook my head slowly. ""I won't apologize. Never.""



With that, I turned around, straightened my back, and ignoring the sharp pain in my cheek and the blood, walked step by step, steadily, through the parting crowd. My dress trailed behind me like a bloodstain.



Everything behind me had completely collapsed, turned to ashes. The night wind outside the door slapped my face like a hand, only making me more clear-headed. In my heart, only one thought burned clearly.



8 PM. Old Pier.



Never look back.



Chapter 4: Silent Farewell

The burning ache on my cheek and the metallic tang of blood were like twin brands of disgrace, constant reminders of the ordeal. Beneath the frozen ash in my chest, there was no ripple of feeling. Only a near-arctic clarity guided my movements.



I returned home and walked into the spacious, icy living room. Beyond the vast floor-to-ceiling windows, the city's neon lights still glittered, illuminating this luxurious, warmth-less cage.



Everything here – the bespoke Italian sofa, the abstract masterpieces on the walls, the antique grand piano in the corner – reeked of lies and betrayal.



Suddenly, a thought crystallized with chilling clarity.



Without hesitation, I went straight to the study. My target was clear.



Pulling open the top drawer of the desk, I found expensive stationery neatly arranged. I extracted a single sheet of the whitest, most pristine manuscript paper, printed with staves – a gift from Adrien for me to ""record my inspiration."" The irony was bitter.



A sharp sting came from my fingertip – the earlier cut had formed a thin scab. Staring at the small, dark red spot, I recalled the blood from Adrien's slap.



I didn't hesitate. I dug my nail deliberately into the thin scab on my index finger until it broke. A bead of fresh, warm blood welled up instantly, carrying the scent of life and iron.



I pressed my bleeding fingertip firmly onto the top left corner of the manuscript paper. A clear, perfect blood fingerprint, like a dissonant note or a fallen teardrop, instantly stained the paper meant for musical purity. The crimson glared against the white despair.



Then, I picked up the expensive fountain pen Adrien had given me. Dipping the nib into the fresh, warm blood, mixing it with the dark black ink, I began to write below the bloody fingerprint, within the blank staves meant for melody and soul. Not notes, but my final accusation and farewell.



The nib scratched lightly against the paper, a sound like a silent requiem.



""When this final movement plays, I will have sunk into the deep sea, or turned to dust.""



""Five years of deception. ‘Treasure' was my chains, ‘perfection' a lie. All to conceal the filth behind the curtain.""



""Diary and beads—the evidence is clear. My music, the final requiem.""



""Adrien, your love is noise. Olivia, your friendship is poison.""



""Do not search. Our paths will never cross again. This sullied stage is yours to perform upon.""



""May you both, in your endless fugue of lies, descend into hell forever.""



Tears fell silently, dripping onto the still-damp blood and ink, blurring small, dark smudges. I watched them spread expressionlessly, as if observing a stranger's story. No grief, no joy remained—only a desolate expanse of ice within.



After the final word, I put down the pen. The blood-and-ink scrawl stood starkly on the pristine manuscript paper, a grotesque wound, a silent dirge.



I didn't look back. I placed this blood-and-tear-soaked letter squarely in the center of the massive, gleaming redwood coffee table in the living room. It was jarringly conspicuous, like a stone cast into stagnant water, destined to cause ripples.



That done, I scanned the place I'd lived for five years. No nostalgia stirred, only a cold, profound relief, as if finally shedding crushing shackles.



I returned to the walk-in closet, stripped off the blood-stained couture gown symbolizing ""Mrs. Black,"" and pulled on a simple black T-shirt and jeans. I shouldered an inconspicuous canvas backpack holding cash, my new identity papers, an untraceable encrypted phone, and bare essentials.



Finally, my gaze settled on the velvet box on the dresser. Inside lay the diamond ring from Adrien's proposal—the cornerstone of a colossal lie.



I picked it up. The cold stone sparkled with false brilliance under the light. Without a flicker of hesitation, I walked to the living room and placed it gently beside the blood letter.



The cold diamond ring rested atop the tear-and-blood-stained accusation.



This was the ""perfect"" finale to my marriage.



I walked to the foyer, flicked off every main light in the living room and hallway. The space plunged into semi-darkness, lit only by the city's ambient glow filtering through the windows, outlining the blurred silhouettes of furniture.



I pulled open the heavy oak door. The slightly cool air of the early autumn night, carrying the scent of freedom, washed over me. The door clicked shut softly behind me. Click. A sound like the final note of a long, torturous piece falling into silence.



I stepped out of the cage called ""home,"" and never looked back.",1,1761370696.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Jamestown Base, Moon, April 23rd, 2043 C.E.

Moon radio: ""Gooooood Morning, Jamestown! I'm Samantha James, your host of channel 19.73 FM. And what a beautiful morning it is here near the Arago crater. It is 8 A.M here on the moon. To all you kids down on Earth working on a moon project, we currently have a Waxing Gibbous phase for your viewing pleasure. If you're hoping for a full moon, I am sorry to disappoint you. You will have to take it up with the astrophysicists.""

Samantha James: ""And before we get started with our usual program. I'd first like to start the day with a bit of music. So here is an earthling classic, 'Fly Me to the Moon', by Frank Sinatra.""

As the soothing music starts to play on the speakers, Samantha deeply stretches from her chair. She uses little force to push herself up with the help of the low gravity of the moon. Her mag-boots clicking in place. She went over to the three-inch thick window and basked in her view.

The view of the lunar surface, with the added view of Earth, made her job all the sweeter. Her main job as the Astrobotanist on the station allowed her ample time to herself. Well, ""self"" could be used lightly since it was more ordered by NASA than anything. To give the people of Earth something to listen to, her radio show was given the green light.

*Tap tap* ""Enjoying yourself?""

She looked at the door leading to her 'lab/radio studio' to see a man leaning on the frame. Giving him a shrug, ""Why wouldn't I? Best seat in the house. Except for the Command Center, Captain."" She noticed his left arm was behind his back.

Captain Matthew just chuckles, ""You could say that, but I'd rather be in here with the lettuce. Besides, I've got something for you. Proof of your labor."" From behind was a box of freshly made donuts, or what the box had inscribed in Sharpie, 'Moonnuts'. ""The wheat you grew worked extremely well; there is more being made for the rest of the crew. We figured you should be the first to try them.""

Eagerly, she egged him over to the spare chair. The 'Moonnuts' were still warm enough to fog the glass protecting them from the vacuum. The 'Moonnuts' were the best thing Samantha had had in a very long time. Thankfully, fresh coffee had been shipped to them from the last shuttle. NASA originally said it was a waste of resources, but gave in once enough protests came from the NASA crew. Even the EU and BRICS crews wanted coffee. So each administration split the costs, reluctantly.

The two of them ate and talked for a good bit. Mainly about their work, family, and random things going on around the station. They were on the last two 'Moonnuts' when the call came over the speakers.

""Captains to the command center!""

""Priority One!""

""Captains to the command center!""

A Priority One alert, the crew of the Jamestown, the Diana, and the Chang'e practiced such an alert for worst-case scenarios. Such as a reactor meltdown. But no warning lights were going off, which was strange. The communal mess hall for the three bases was designated as the safe zone for the non-mission-critical crew to congregate in case of such alerts.

Confusion spread through the language barrier like a stone through water. Questions were raised, but none were answered. That was until a young Brazilian mechanic looked out the window. First one, then two, then four, then nine, then twenty, until the entire safe-zone occupants' eyes became glued to what was happening out in space.

A ship of unknown origin floated in their view, lights flickering, engines a light blue. A hole that could be the size of a football field was leaking atmosphere, some kind of liquid, and what appeared to be humanoid shapes from its hull. They watched as it slowly turned to reveal five more ships, bolts of light flashing towards one another. Slowly, they hurled towards Earth.

Journal entry: February 25th, 5661 C.E.

I have decided to write a journal during the journey to Coruscant, the Capital planet of the Galactic Republic. Mainly because I have a few hours to kill. To jog my memory, I've decided to write down everything I remember from the past few millennia. To my history teacher, the former Mistress of Cortow, Miss Shelnew. If you ever read this journal, I hope I make you proud.

In a galaxy so vast and full of life, it's hard to imagine our planet not being found early on in our civilization. Especially when we wanted to be found, but during the time known to historians called ""The years of red"". We as a species changed, in our minds, our hearts, and in our very souls. We changed.

During the early to mid twenty-first century, then called *Earth,* was going through what's known as the *Troubles*. Yes, the name is copied from the time during the British occupation of then Northern Ireland. It was deemed fitting to name this era of history after it.

Global economic collapse, political turmoil, the rise of fascism, misinformation, hyper-inflation, corporate greed, and the climate crisis. Any one of those and more were happening all at once. Global poverty was in the double digits, alliances that had held since the Second World War collapsed in front of our eyes. Nations thought 'too big to fail', and slowly did.

But what started as a sliver of hope, a signal, a speck. A speck that turned into three. Skipping throughout the solar system like a rock on water. Till finally landing on our front door, turning into a nightmare. Five damaged ships: 'The Indomitable', 'The Pariah', and 'The Monarch' of the Eternal Empire. 'The Imperial Fury' of the Sith, 'The Ambition' and 'The Peace' of the Republic. Locked in fierce combat, they had made incalculable jumps across the stars. We were lucky they didn't jump through our planet. But with being so heavily damaged, *Earth's* gravity pulled them down onto our home.

'The Peace' came first; it was so badly damaged that it got caught in Luna's orbit. The other five crashed relatively close to major areas. The Indomitable, the Eternal Empire's main battleship for its sector. From her records, she had just enough power to push herself to the middle of the ""Strait of Gibraltar"". Effectively cutting the Mediterranean off from the Atlantic. Her steel was stained with friction and steamed the ocean. I'm gonna just use EE for the ships.

The Pariah, an EE Support Cruiser that broke in two pieces in the atmosphere. Kinda like the Titanic. The front half crashed on Tioman Island, Malaysia. Nearly skipping back into the ocean. The back half crashed and was buried in a botanical garden of Mount Gede, Indonesia. If I remember correctly, in the final year of the war, the volcano erupted from some fuel leakage.

The Monarch, an EE Battlecruiser, actually managed to land peacefully off the coast of Midway. I do use that word VERY lightly here. The ship turned into a floating fortress.

The Imperial Fury, her crimson steel blended in with the forest fires of the Appalachian mountains. Many coal towns had been crushed by the crash, while others would have wished for such a merciful fate. For what came from the hull made the fiery pits of hell a godsend.

The Ambition is still the most elegant vessel I have ever seen. She crashed in the harsh winter forests of Finland. Her engines became the foundation of our modern fleet. And the center of the naval academy.

From these five ships, we met the galaxy as it had been for generations. Bloody. Later, we learned their names at the cost of Men, Women, and children. We learned.

The Eternal Empire, with its authoritarian fist, crushed the Spanish Navy with its turbolasers. They were there just scouting, to rescue what survivors remained. To give her crew humanity's warm embrace, and those bastards boiled it alive. An hour later, their fighters knocked Spain out by turning the air bases into molten slag. Ten thousand Skytrooper droids were unleashed on densely populated areas to distract the military.

The Knights of Zakuul were sent in; two hundred took Madrid. Slaughtering parliament, displaying the corpses from the walls. They skinned the prime minister alive. The footage still haunts me to this day. The names of the victims were carved into the stone walls of the former parliament building. Their crimson color glowed in the night. ""The Madrid Slaughter,"" it was named, the museum holds the armor of those Knights of Zakuul. Each helm has a bullet hole the size of an acorn.

Because of this atrocity put on full display, Article Five of the NATO alliance was authorized. Well, what was left of the alliance anyway? It took the combined effort of the United Nations Security Council to get not just one group of nations, but all to come to the table and figure out the next course of action. Next course of action... HA! The U.N. was a bureaucratic mess, even before the *Troubles*, but it took the right amount of bloodshed to get the ball actually to move.

The former states of West Virginia and Kentucky still have scars from the Sith's occupation. I saw on the news recently that a Clarmiction, a worm-like species that can tunnel in the ground, is nice to people. Had dug too deep and discovered a Sith temple long forgotten. The bones of the slaves who were forced to carve their pillars lay everywhere. The brands are still etched into the bones.

The monster/captain of The Imperial Fury, I believe his name was Darth Paenboden. Or something similarly stupid, had claimed *Earth* to be his planetary fortress. The Imperial Fury had held around ten divisions of imperial infantry. With the assortment of armor divisions, walkers, and tanks. War droids, the Mark ones and twos, made up the bulk of their forces. Each town and city became a mini-fortress. Their fighters owned the skies, for a time.

I say ""for a time"" not as an exaggeration. It's still funny to watch the broadcasts from that Gran Sith Lord. Declaring the Human Race his subjects for the pleasure of the Sith Empire. The fucker sounded like Mussolini with a lisp. Because of that broadcast, the flames of war were stoked in the country he just so happened to crash in.

Instead of doing the stereotypical, Hollywood-esque speech to the world and the Sith invaders. A simple message was sent out to the world, one that to this day is etched in the halls of planetary capitals. In the dead language of fallen empires. *""Si hodie moriar, cum fratribus sororibusque meis huius mundi sit. Una pugnemus. Fortiores et callidiores quam antea emergamus. Non solum supervivamus, sed etiam floreamus. Ad mare nigrum perveniamus. Mare inter astra."" (If I die today, let it be with my brothers and sisters of this world. Let us fight together. Let us come out stronger and smarter than before. Let us not just survive, let us thrive. Let us reach into the black sea. A Sea Among Stars.)*

President Jasmin Jones died three days later from the Sith Lord's blade. A memorial was built in her honor on the Potomac River.

The Republic, or The Old Republic as it's referred to now, I think. Only deployed troopers, battle droids, and fighters to defend The Ambition. A major portion of the Finnish military just so happened to be nearby because of skirmishes on the Finland-Russian border. In a way, this utter shitshow in our history stopped Nuclear Armageddon.

The Jedi who were in command both surrendered to the Finnish military as a show of peace, Master Malick Vair, a Bothan. And his former master, Master Pearl Bounksay, a blue female Mikkian. Leaving some Commander in charge, actually, most of the troopers were human.

Both Jedi Masters explained what happened, which I am not putting here since it would make this journal into a whole novel of information. The basics are this: The Eternal Empire pops out of nowhere and starts wrecking the place. First, the Republic, then the Sith. They were sent to some planet on the border of the 'Unknown Region' to defend a major system. The Sith got there first to claim it.

Sith Lord three-eyes McGee thought they were there to claim his prize and attacked. Leaving both to end up being attacked by the Eternal Empire. A three-way battle commences.

Their explanation as to how they ended up in *Earth's* system is kinda funny. The droids that operated on the bridges started to talk to each other. And forged transmissions from their high commands. Causing a chase only comparable to Tom and Jerry. Randomized jumps throughout the Unknown Region landed them on our doorstep.

For five years, we fought; every ocean, every continent had some form of fighting. Many nations took advantage of the crisis to form alliances with the invaders to gain an edge. Once the fighting was done with Earth victorious, those who did were tried in the newly formed *Terran Republic* and hanged.

The Jedi, along with what was the equivalent of an ambassador, offered us a seat in *the Republic*. It sounds like a good deal, but with all that had happened in those five years, it was a hard thing to sell. Of course, we had been given time to think about the offer.

If I remember correctly, the mission was codenamed ""Unforgivable"" something. Everyone, the Jedi, troopers, staff, everyone was executed in some form. It wasn't out of hatred, mind you; every *Terran* is taught at a young age that what happened to them was not out of hatred, but out of self-preservation.

We, at the time, a small planet with no real spacefaring technology, just took out small portions of two major factions at the start of a galactic war. And hours from then, the whole galaxy was about to know. It was a difficult choice, and the men and women knew this fact. To commit murder on brothers and sisters in arms, friends and comrades. For some lovers, it was just truly unforgivable.

For two hundred years, the op was sealed behind so much red tape that not even major world leaders when it happened knew that it happened. It was reported as remnants of the Knights of Zakuul and Sith Warriors. But by the time the real answers were revealed to the public, it didn't matter; enough time had passed to just say ""Damn, that sucks"".

That and once the transmission links had become fully functional, we as a species were now able to see how the galaxy as a whole was faring since the galactic war had started. As to why it took two hundred years to get our version of the holonet up and running. It was surprisingly difficult to both reengineer it and make sure that it couldn't be tracked back home. What we saw should have surprised us, but all it did was disappoint us.

We watched for thirty-six hundred years. Slavery, Corruption, MegaCorporate monopolies, and a system of governance slowly becoming ineffective take hold. Too fat and bloated with years of ineffective change. Viewing galactic history unfolding in front of our very eyes. We waited in the shadows, collecting information, technology, and organisms.

It wasn't kidnapping if the 'sentient being' was already dead. A spaceship here and there. Mainly those that got lost in the Unknown Region. With massive sections of it being so barren, it was easy to conquer and add to our well. I don't want to call us an empire, but the only other thing I can think of is our official name: Federation of Terra.

The scientists found that all the species collected all had in common the little creatures in their bloodstreams. When we dug into the logs of a science ship, we found that they actually were called ""Midi-clorian's"". The same ones, those ancient egg heads found in the enemy on various levels on the battlefield. Something that everyone had on some level in the galaxy. We thought it was just a fluke that we, *Terrans,* are excluded. No matter, I do not need to go into details. This is just a journal after all.

Actually, I'll go into a little detail, just a little. It was confirmed to be a major evolutionary trait. Proven by, well,l a funny thing, they tried to use the blood of the Jedi to make some super serum. Never worked.

The more we found out about the wider galaxy, the more votes the side of 'Stealth' would get, which makes sense. No point in interacting with those who may do us harm. All of this changed when that damned Hyperspace lane searcher jumped into one of our 'few' colony systems, such a primitive mode of transport. Well, that's what we told them anyway. It was a mixed species ship and they...

I have no more time to put into this; we just arrived at Courusant.

James Niles



**The Galactic Republic, Courusant, 2 weeks before the Galactic Civil War.**

The Senate chamber of the Republic has stood for millennia. The halls of democracy are always booming with bureaucracy. But due to recent events with the Trade Federation and banking clans blockading multiple outer rim planets. Said planets have joined the Separatist Coalition that has been growing in the Senate for several years.

Chancellor Palpatine has given the floor to the Trade Federation, and all the while hiding a grin with his masterful plans for war.

""Senator Amidala! You accuse us of breaking galactic laws every cycle. But I say to you that we, the Trade Federation, have done no such thing. You are a liar!"" The Neimoidian hollered across the chamber at the young Naboo senator. His golden eyes bulged with satisfaction. He felt the Federation's anonymity was secure. And why shouldn't he? For over two hundred years, it has, why not today?

""Senator, like I have stated. I have undeniable PROOF that you are!"" Senator Amidala took a drive that had been given to her by a blockade runner from an outer rim planet called 'Belladoon' in the Myto Sector. And placed it in the projection slot for all to see.

They all watched as the center of the chamber lit up with a bright blue hologram. To Ambassador Niles' eyes, it was primitive, and it hurt to look at.

""Those frog-looking guys sound stereotypical Asian. Like from old Earth movies that made fun of them."" An aide whispered into James's ear.

""What?""

""Yeah, you know, from the 20th Century.""

""Ah, I can see what you mean. Probably just a coincidence with their vocal cords,"" James kept his eyes on the debate at hand. He, the aides, and three guards that accompanied him wore handmade, tailored fit suits from only the best material the Capital System of the Federation could produce.

Fine Neptunian silk, dyed a deep ocean blue for the three-piece suits. Shined bronze buttons from the rings of Saturn. Burgundy dress shoes crafted from fresh leather from the Napoleon province on Mars. Both the undershirts and timepieces were crafted by *Terra's* finest. For those in the three-piece suits, a pine green tie woven in silk from Luna.

The Senator from Naboo personally invited them to the planet in hopes of them joining the wider galaxy. Her sleek ship stood out like a sore thumb in front of the capital city of SD-2536, the official name being Ithaca. It took some convincing on her end to get them to at least come to Courisant.

For the past few days, she had also personally shown the delegation of the FT (Federation of Terra) the history and culture of the Galactic Republic. Which just really turned into a few dozen trips to museums, meeting senators. And Chancellor Palpatine. The man gave James a strange vibe, as if there was just something about the guy that was off.

The last group they met was from the Jedi Council. A small, green, goblin-looking guy named Jedi Master Yoda. And for some reason talks backward, which makes no sense since the FT has documented that his species doesn't do that normally. But was kind and very curious about the delegation. And Jedi Master Mace Windu seemed friendly enough.

For exactly two days, the delegation was given its own Repulsorpod. A slow, floating platform for those who wish to debate. *Primitive vehicle, but simple enough for its use.* James thought as he watched Senator Amadallas move into another location to dictate over the holograph.

""As you can see, and from what I have stated before. You have blockaded this planet for no reason other than for more credits. Under galactic law, you must be fined, and your ships to leave the system in thirty days."" She was satisfied; she had the evidence and enough backing to push it through. Next, was not in her cards that she had stacked.

""Ambassador James, of the Federation of Terra. What do you, as an outsider, think the Trade Federation's actions should be handled?"" The Chancellor's voice echoed through the chamber. All eyes are now on James and the delegation. Unwillingly, the floating pod brought them to the center between the two senators. Putting them center stage in this showdown.

""Well, with all due respect, I don't think we really have a say on this matter. We're just here to watch."" James watched for the man's reaction, but he showed none.

""Nonsense, myself and the senators are quite curious about you and want your opinion. To see how you will fare in our Republic."" The old man japed. Murmurs echoed around the chamber; clearly, this wasn't normal. The Naboo senator showed some surprise at the comment. Such things were supposed to be done behind closed doors.

James mentally rolled his eyes, ""Fine, in our Federation, we have no MegaCorporations, such as the Trade Federation. We heavily regulate such things from happening. When a company almost reaches such a level, we break it up into smaller ones and put a two-hundred-year restraint on them from being bought out. We have seen their ways and what they do to blockaded planets. We never let that happen.""

""As to what should happen if it were up to us. Break their monopoly. Senator Amedalla told us of her planet's previous encounter with them. And all the Senate did was send a delegation. Then the Trade Federation tried to have them both killed. So I say again, break the monopoly.""

This brought shockwaves throughout the chamber. The senator from the Trade Federation was too angry to speak. Sure, the idea has been passed around in private, but this was the first time this idea was brought to the table. The Trade Federation usually found the source of the idea and 'stopped it' before it could hatch. But most thought it was too extreme, since the blockades happened to outer rim worlds.

Only a few, such as Senator Amedalla, would bring it to the floor. But it would usually be ignored. But not today, today the FT was here and just gave the Senator's proposal enough of a push to get it passed.

The moment the Senate was dismissed for the day, James was bombarded with questions from the media. Mainly on account of the Chancellor's words. The mixed messaging was adding pressure. If the FT is to join the Galactic Republic.

When they first arrived on this city planet, James had told everyone. Including the Jedi delegation that who were only here to observe and think on how to move forward. The original plan that James was given went as follows: Observe, collect, and then discuss some small trade agreements in private. Nothing more, nothing less. And the Chancellor just threw a wrench into that plan.

**Office of the Chancellor, Coruscant**

Palpatine waited in his office for Senator Amidala and the Ambassador of this so-called ""Federation of Terra"". So bland, so, so boring. Being from the unknown region of the galaxy left too many unknowns for his liking. From the information that had been given to him, a lot seemed to be left out. Like pieces of a puzzle missing. The datapad mainly showed the basic history of the planet, culture, wildlife, and some technology. Basic planetary defenses, orbital platforms, and a few heavy cruisers.

*These Terrans seem to be underdefended to speak so boldly. No matter, I can have some spies there in a few weeks if all goes well.* He thought to himself as the guard outside knocked and let him know his appointment had arrived. ""Please, send them in.""

He watched as the two were let in. He stood calmly and greeted them both. The Ambassador held his hand out to shake his. It was strange, not the act of shaking, but to do so with him. *A chancellor should be bowed to, as is tradition dating back to the beginning of The Republic.* He gestured to the four plush chairs in front of his desk. When he sat his hand went to a button on his chair to call some refreshments for his guests.

""I hope I was not being so rash in my presumption of your... Intentions on the visit to the Capital these past few days."" Chancellor Palpatine said with an apologetic tone accompanied with a slight smile. It seems almost real to James, it was just slightly difficult to accept from the display that happened hours ago.

""I can only presume that our intentions were, as we say, 'Lost in translation'. If you understand my meaning. I was just sent here to mediate for my government on simple trade deals and access to the wider galaxy to conduct business.""

""Ah yes, I believe I understand your meaning. I do hope I did not put a bad impression of the Galactic Republic to you, or the Federation of Terra as a whole."" The Chancellor said, still showing that smile.

""Not at all."" James' gaze never faltered, ""We just wish to take things slow."" He studied the man in front of him in his galant robes. Wrinkles that have seen many senators, dignitaries, and ambassadors like James. A man built on the battle of politics.

""If I may ask,"" Senator Amidala, or as she told James to call her 'Senator Padmé' or just Padmé began, ""why take things slow? You said it yourself that your people thought that you were alone in the galaxy. Being so isolated would make any civilization crave the chance to interact with a whole galaxy. And being in the Outer-Rim of the Unknown Region, the Federation will now have access to so many things that your people may lack and need.""

In a normal situation, if what James had told her was true. It would be the most logical choice. But this wasn't one of those situations.

""We have our reason. Another way of putting it would be this: 'The problems not about the distance, It's what lies in between'. With our home system and colonies being so far from the major planets. What if we become too reliant on the Republic, and something happens?""

""Pirate warlords, or an invading army. Or those Hutt Gangsters get some ideas to claim our systems for themselves. The Republic seems to have little control of the Outer-Rim, letting them roam free. They control systems in your territory, such as Tatooine from what I read. It's like the *Wild West* of old *Earth*. Lawless. We can't risk that.""

The Chancellor pondered for a moment, it seemed his point had gotten through. ""The Senate could give you political backing with neighboring systems to help you for such endeavors. As for the Hutts, to actually decide on such a course of action. Senator Amidala and myself could petition a vote for The Senate to negotiate the problem. The Jedi Council also may be able to assist."" Padmé nodded her head in agreement.

""Just negotiate?"" James questioned, it came off with slight rudeness. But the Chancellor's solution seemed half-assed. ""With all due respect, Chancellor. To us, if the Hutts decided such action would be considered an Act of War. And we would have no choice but to call arms. From what I have learned about The Galactic Republic, you have no standing Military. Of any kind. Would The Republic come to our aid?""

It seemed to James that he struck a nerve in the Chancellor. Nothing outrageous, but just a subtle eye twitch. Before he could reply, the door leading further into the Chancellor's suite opened, revealing a silver protocol droid holding a tray of drinks and a pitcher. Three glasses of spring colored liquid that were floating. Each bounced with the droid's step.

They watched in silence as the droid placed the pitcher on the desk, and oriented the floating classes in front of them. The room remained silent as the droid bowed and scurried out the room. The servos filling James' ears.

James raised a brow and gestured to the still floating glass before him. ""What's this?""

""This Ambassador is Emerald Wine. It is made from Emerald Grapes from Naboo. One of the finest wines available in the Galactic Republic. I believed this meeting would call for such a... Luxurious beverage. I would have thought the Senator would have offered it to you during your very first meeting. Am I wrong?"" The Chancellor said with a smile as he gracefully carried the glass to his lips and drank.

Padmé took the glass and swirled the emerald liquid. ""I only have it for special holidays or events on Naboo. It didn't cross my mind."" She smiled as a memory passed through her mind with those words and then drank.

""I must decline. I don't drink on the job, Chancellor."" James said, pushing the glass slightly away. The man seemed more surprised at his actions than anything else. *I guess no one has ever declined you, eh Palpatine?*

He took another sip, ""Now now James. Don't think of this as work. Think of it as a night out with soon to be friends. Please, I insisted."" and spoke as he pushed the glass back to him.

James looked to Padmé, ""Why not? Let's see where the night goes."" and then shrugged.

*Well, I did act rude to him. Calling out like a thousand years of 'relative' peace because of the 'Ruusan Reformation',* Sighing, he took the glass and drank. The wine wasn't bad, it tasted like a sweeter wine made from energon flowers. ""Sure, why not?""

**Three hours of ""Negotiations"" later.**

Several drinks of Emerald Wine really pack a punch. Thankfully, James was what would be considered a frat-bro during his college days at Mars University and developed quite a tolerance. Padmé on the other stopped at two.

Chancellor Palpatine seemed to be taken by its effects as well. Red faced, he said his good-byes and hoped to see them again for the signing of the trade deals over the next few days. He watched as the group made their way to the elevator and left.

Once at the hover pads, James said his good-byes to the Senator and went to the provided transport to the hotel. Nearly tripping over his own feed, he had to be guided with one arm from his aid, Jennifer. When situated, the speeder left.

""Are we"", James belched into a fist, ""clear of the locals?""

""Yes, sir. We're good.""

""Ugh, finally. Hand me one of those syringes"" He watched as she grabbed a blue syringe willed with neon purple liquid. Then taking the needle he sticks it into his neck and injects it. His neck begins to crack, and the veins turn purple as the substance makes its way through the body. Then the symptoms of the alcohol vanish.

Chancellor Palpatine watched from his Private Office window as the Federation of Terrans speeder left. The symptoms from the wine were child's play to remove from his body with the Force. Having to up his body heat made his face redness annoyed him after. Felt like a bug had crawled on his face.

He channeled his will into the Force to reach James. To mend his mind into giving terms more favorable to The Senate and him during their next meeting. Setting a path for the Federation to join The Republic.

But something was amiss, he was able to locate the speeder easily. Just the occupants were blank. The speeder's occupants were just black as night, their outlines were visible in his mind, just that there was nothing for him to take a hold of. A void in the Force as black as a black hole in space. He saw their mouths move, but no sound came. Lifting his hand, he reached for James with all his strength.

*Beep Beep*

*Beep Beep*

The Nano Internal Computer (NIC) in James' arm rang a warning. Sending a pulse through his nerves. The Force Protection/Detection System (FPDS) actually worked outside of lab tests. It uses Synthetic Midi-clorian's as a type of buoy system to detect the Force being used. The manufacturing process of the Synthetic Midi-clorian's was discovered in thirty-forty eight. An abandoned research facility working on the process had been discovered deep in Unknown Regions, once belonging to the Eternal Empire.

His left forearm pulsed a crimson red under his sleeve. Instinctively, he pulled it down to reveal the information. ""Well well well. Guess the President was right to be concerned."" James said with a smirk. Jennifer turned her forearm, activating her NIC. Her all clear was customized to green. The guards with him were set to the standard blue. Only he was being targeted with the Force.

Captain Ramirez, the head of James' security detail, looked at his forearm frowning. ""Does your NIC say where it's coming from, Sir? I'm not getting a bearing on it.""

""No point.""

""Sir?""

""In that report from the Naboo blockade it said a Sith Lord was killed. I thought it was just a fluke when I read the original action report on Ithaca. Like a Zabrak found a Sith artifact and was driven by the Force to learn the darkside. But the fact that it took this long for the safeguards to sound off says otherwise.""

""So, the Sith are still around?""

""Yep, and who's trying to get me is a Sith Lord most likely. I have some ideas as to where it's coming from. Let's give them a **shocking** wake up call."" James presses a button on his forearm, making the light turn a flashing yellow.

*BZZT*

""AAHHHH!"" Pain shot through Palpatine's body, causing him to fall into a nearby chair. *Shocked. I was shocked through the Force?* This should not be possible. No, it is impossible. No Sith or Jedi has the ability to do such a thing. This made his blood boil over. He, a Sith Lord, was just shocked by a forceless species from an upstart civilization. He would not let this stand.

The silver protocol droid came in to see the commotion. Worried for his master's well being. As the door closed behind the droid, his master twisted to him from a chair and reached a menacing hand out. Easily, Palpatine crushed the protocol droid into a ball. And flung it into the walls in a fit of rage.

""No one makes a fool of me!"" *Crash*

""Not the Jedi!"" *Crash*

""Not the Senate!"" *Crash*

""No one!"" *Crash*

\[ Author: Hello there! I hope everyone enjoyed the first chapter to my new fic: A Sea Among Stars!! I originally had it up under a oneshot/practice page, but deleted it after looking the original over. It was terrible, like the worst thing I've ever read.

I am happy to say that this chapter is LIGHTYEARS better. Some of you are probably wondering if this is going to take over The Storm in terms of priority. Short answer: No. This story is going to be worked on side-by-side with The Storm.

I started working on this to not get burned out from The Storm and the Medieval Setting. The Storm will always have a place in my heart. I just wanted to work on something different to decompress. And I get to learn more about Star Wars when researching!

Posting should be around the one month time frame. With school, work, and personal stuff going on in my life that is the quickest I can do. I am sorry :( .

Don't forget to join the Discord I made if you have anything to suggest, add, share, correct, or just want to come by and say hi! I am not perfect, I will make mistakes.

Might wonder was I in the right sound of mind? No. 

In my tween and early teen years , I copied groping and looking underneath womens skirts and I regreted it as it was long ago but I still see myself as a monster. 

I even copied violent actions from family guy as a tween and early teenager. 

I don't feel comfortable disclosing the violent information but I still feel like I should go to hell to atone for my sins. 

I know now that the things I did was bad shit insane and even my mom knows the truth why I acted like that since I told her recently a month ago, that I copied the stuff I did from anime or family guy.

She used to be addicted to aderall and she was a scary and paranoid person which made me find a way to cope with watching adult shows and being on the Internet to cope with the harsh reality when I was a early teen.

Honestly, now I work as a janitor for my uncle's trucking lot company and I clean thoroughly and I'm friendly with coworkers as I do my job.

Might wonder why I changed to a redeemed person...

Well when I was almost 18 years old, I wanted to redeem myself and I did as I sought redemption and when I hit 20 I went to jail for having a psychotic breakdown I feel bad for and I took anger management while in therapy by then.

Now I'm 22 years old and I am almost going to be 23 years old in February, 12, 2003. 

Either way I had a rough past as my mom when I was a kid went to a police station or fire department, threatening to leave me or my brother there and that shit traumatized me.

Plus domestic violence was one of it as we all were violent towards each other occasionally back then.

Would I like to go to hell instead of heaven?

Yes.

Do I deserve to die alone?

Yes.

Then that settles what I am as the Internet also messed me up too and I don't want to remember those god forsaken images I saw as an early tween.

I just want to die in a jail cell when I'm old and in Bexar county so I can have a decent last meal and be arrested for property damage in the future.

Either way, I'll continue living with my mom and taking care of her and getting her coffee and whatever she needs as I don't want to lose her.

1ofjkgx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofjkgx,The Adventures of the Mud Queen — Episode 4: “The Kitchen Catastrophe”,"It was official: Lila Bellyton was an internet legend.

First mud, then paint, then smoothie.
By now, the whole world seemed to know her as “The Mud Queen” — a cheerful blonde with a talent for turning herself into a walking mess. Her latest viral hit — the pink smoothie splash — had sparked a new round of memes.

There were T-shirts that said “Stay Calm and Spill On”, reaction GIFs of her shocked expression, and even a Halloween costume tutorial titled “How to Dress Like the Mud Queen (Bonus Smoothie Edition!)”

Lila had stopped trying to fight it.
“Well,” she told herself in the mirror one morning, adjusting her leopard-print crop turtleneck, “if you can’t escape the chaos, at least dress like you own it.”


---

The Invitation

That Saturday, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Mia Cornell, the queen of schemes and Lila’s best friend-slash-part-time chaos enabler.

> Mia: “Cooking class today! No mud, no paint, no smoothies, promise 😇”
Lila: “I’ve heard that lie before.”
Mia: “C’mon, it’s almost Halloween! We’re making spooky snacks!”



Lila sighed. “Halloween… what could possibly go wrong?”

She threw on her favorite leopard crop top, denim shorts, and a determined smile. “This time,” she declared, “I’m walking out clean.”


---

The Cooking Class

Mia’s kitchen was spotless when Lila arrived — gleaming countertops, fresh pumpkins lined up, and bowls of candy neatly arranged. Sophie and Tina were already there, wearing aprons that read “Witchin’ in the Kitchen.”

Lila pointed at them. “Where’s mine?”
Mia smirked. “You’re the Mud Queen. You don’t wear aprons — they wear you.”
Lila groaned. “I’m never living that down, am I?”

They started cooking — mixing chocolate, icing cookies, and carving pumpkin faces that looked more silly than spooky. For once, everything went smoothly. Lila even managed to frost a cupcake without spilling anything.

“See?” she said proudly. “Look at me — spotless. Clean. Elegant.”
Tina nodded. “Maybe the curse is broken.”
Sophie snorted. “Don’t jinx it.”


---

The Fall

The afternoon went great — right up until the moment it didn’t.

The kitchen smelled amazing, the pumpkin pie was cooling, and everyone was laughing about last year’s Halloween photos. Lila grabbed a tray of ghost-shaped cookies and began walking toward the dining table.

Then it happened.

One tiny piece of pumpkin peel had fallen on the floor — a small, innocent slice of doom.

Lila stepped on it.

“Whoa—!”

Her foot slipped, the tray tilted, and before anyone could react—

CRASH!

Lila stumbled sideways, arms flailing, and slammed right into the kitchen bin.

The lid popped open like a jack-in-the-box. Out flew a chaotic rain of food scraps — apple peels, flour clumps, chocolate bits, paper towels, and what looked suspiciously like pumpkin guts.

By the time she stopped moving, the bin had tipped, and Lila stood frozen in the middle of the kitchen — a Halloween collage of leftovers and disaster plastered across her belly and shorts.

There was silence.
Then Sophie burst out laughing.
“Oh my— Lila! Not again!”

Mia was crying from laughter. “You slipped into the garbage! This is a new record!”

Lila looked down, speechless, then slowly raised her hands and grinned.
“Well,” she said, “guess I’m recycling myself into the story.”


---

The Pose Returns

Of course, someone had to take a photo.
Tina, ever the opportunist, shouted, “Hold that pose, Your Majesty!”

Lila sighed, then raised her arms dramatically, tongue out, striking her now-iconic Mud Queen stance — the very same one that had made her famous. Except this time, instead of mud or paint, her belly was decorated with coffee grounds, onion skins, and cookie crumbs.

Mia snapped the shot.
Sophie added, “Call this one ‘The Kitchen Catastrophe.’”

They laughed until they couldn’t breathe.


---

The Viral Wave (Again)

That evening, Lila’s phone exploded.

The new photo hit social media faster than pumpkin spice in October.

> “The Mud Queen returns — now compost-friendly!”
“From smoothie to spooky — she never misses a spill!”
“#EcoQueen #HalloweenSpecial #TheAdventuresContinue”



Even a local cooking blog reposted it with the caption:

> “When your recipe calls for chaos — just add Lila.”




---

The Aftermath

Later that night, after scrubbing off the pumpkin bits and cookie crumbs, Lila sat on Mia’s couch, wrapped in a blanket and sipping tea.

Mia grinned. “You know… this might be your best one yet.”
Lila raised an eyebrow. “Best one? I literally fought a trash can.”
“Exactly!” Tina chimed in. “You’re the only person who can fall into garbage and still look like she’s in a photo shoot.”

Lila rolled her eyes but laughed anyway. “I swear, one day I’ll make it through a weekend without ending up as a trending topic.”
Sophie smirked. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep, Your Majesty.”


---

Epilogue

As Lila scrolled through her feed before bed, she found a meme of herself with cartoon bats flying around her and the caption:

> “Queen of Chaos — now serving Halloween realness.”



She laughed, shaking her head.

“Well,” she said, turning off her phone, “at least I’m consistent.”

Then, with a grin, she added under her breath —

1ofjjuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ofjjuz/trip_report_12_days_tokyo_kanazawa_hakone_tokyo/,Trip report - 12 days; Tokyo - Kanazawa - Hakone - Tokyo,"Sharing my trip report, as well as some tips and tricks from our 12-day trip to Japan. I took the trip with my husband, both in our 30s, from the EU.

Overall, we really loved it, especially Kanazawa part, despite some hiccups towards the end (got a food poisoning in the ryokan and the experience there was overall underwhelming). We would love to be back in a few years to explore more. No weird situations during the trip, except some intense stares from kids and old people, especially in Kanazawa (I'm a tall, blonde woman with a lot of tattoos). We decided to avoid certain super touristy spots and activities on purpose and honestly, when we come back one day, I would love to steer clear even more, as the best experiences we had were in a little more understated places ;) 

The plan came together mostly on the go, usually a day in advance, taking the weather into account. We didn’t prebook ahead of time, the Shinkansen tickets we always booked or bought a day before. We initially wanted to fit in another day trip from Kanazawa, but ended up staying there longer instead – and even then, there wasn’t enough time to visit any of the local museums. There’s just so much to see everywhere.

We mostly got around everywhere on foot, occasionally taking a metro using a Suica card picked up at Haneda, and for cross-city trips we took trains – single tickets bought online or at ticket machines. If you move between the hotels/cities, use the luggage-forwarding service, I mean it. It's super convenient, cheap and it will be easier for you and everyone else around you.

During our walks, we usually wandered into smaller, random streets, popped into minor temples, little shops, and even tiny local museums (for example, in Kanazawa’s samurai district there were several of those). We also made plenty of snack stops for some ice-cream, mochis or some taiyaki :) 

# Day 1

Direct flight: Copenhagen – Tokyo Haneda

# Day 2

Morning landing on Haneda – check-in at Asakusa Tobu Hotel (very nice hotel, super convenient location) – walk around Asakusa and Ueno areas

# Day 3

Walk through Ueno Park – Toshogu Shrine – stroll toward Yanaka, passing a bit through Sendagi, exploring local temples, cemeteries, and small shops (my favourite part of Tokyo from what I've seen, though I'm aware we saw like 1/10th of it) – Imperial Gardens (we only managed to see the East Gardens and nearby areas, as the rest was closed that day due to Sports Day) – walk to Tokyo Main Station for dinner – stroll to Ginza to see the architecture and go to Ginza Natsuno to pick up some nice chopsticks

# Day 4

Shibuya crossing – checking out the Hachiko statue (without queueing up for a photo) – walk toward Shinjuku – Yoyogi Park – Meiji Jingu Shrine – Yadorigi Café in Yanaka (one of the only ethical cat cafes in Tokyo, so if you plan to visit such an establishment, try this one)

# Day 5

Wagashi-making workshop and tea ceremony in Asakusa, wearing kimonos (I'm torn on whether I recommend it, it was good value for money for sure and in a way enjoyable, but it was a bit rushed at moments, my hair was done terribly (I didn't complain because staff was very sweet and also we were pressed on time, didn't want to hold the whole group) and if you're a lady larger than EU size 36/S your kimono choice will be significantly worse) – Senso-Ji – evening scenic cruise on the Sumida River with kaiseki dinner (I recommend such an experience, even though the food was not that good)

# Day 6

Travel from Tokyo to Kanazawa via Hokuriku Shinkansen – check-in at Hotel Forza Kanazawa (another great hotel situated conveniently mid-way between the station and main attractions) – we didn’t do anything else that day; it was pouring so hard that after a 15-minute walk, water was literally spilling out of our shoes

# Day 7

Ozaki Shrine – Oyama Shrine – Ishiura Shrine – Kenroku-en Garden including Seisonkaku Villa (both are must-see!) – Higashi Chaya District (a bit of a tourist trap, in my opinion, most of it is boring shops selling more or less the same stuff, the Samurai district is more interesting, though smaller)

# Day 8

Tour of the Myouryuji – Kanazawa Castle and park – Nagamachi District – Nishi Chaya District

# Day 9

Day trip by train to Takayama with a transfer in Toyama (buses were sold out for daaaays after) – Hida No Sato open-air museum – Showa-Kan Museum (surprisingly fun place!) – Sanmachi Suji District – return to Kanazawa (we had planned to see more, but scaled it back due to bear warnings and sightings in the area)

# Day 10

Travel from Kanazawa to Hakone (technically to Miyanoshita) via Kanazawa – Tokyo – Odawara, then bus to the ryokan (Hakone Ginyu - a disappointing experience that I outlined in [a separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1oc1yu4/my_disappointing_experience_with_hakone_ginyu/)) – soaking in the onsen and kaiseki dinner. A tip: if you travel to/from Odawara to Hakone/Miyanoshita, do yourself a favour and take the train, not the bus - it gets stuck in traffic and is overall a terrible experience because people bring huge luggage into a super crowded bus, you stand squeezed like a mackerel and getting out is a nightmare.

# Day 11

Scenic train ride from Miyanoshita to Odawara – local train back to Tokyo – Akihabara (my husband wanted to check out a few places, my least favourite part of Tokyo we've seen) – check-in at Mercure Hotel Tokyo Haneda (fantastic hotel with a great breakfast, super spacious rooms for Tokyo standards)

# Day 12

National Museum – last walk and shopping around Asakusa

# Day 13

Return flight from Haneda Airport

# Our impressions of Japan

Pretty much everywhere, the service is top-notch – that’s simply the industry standard in Japan – but for a European, it’s striking how *many* staff there are, even in places where we wouldn’t expect any. Like a person whose entire job is to stand all day at the entrance of an underground corporate parking lot, or someone assigned just to a certain type of ticket machine at a station, or a person holding a sign and giving directions. In shops, there are often twice as many clerks as in Europe, and it’s impossible to walk through a shop without drawing someone’s attention. You’ll never be left without help, that’s for sure, but if you prefer a more hands-off shopping experience, you might feel a bit overwhelmed at times - I resigned from some cosmetic shopping because the shop assistants would follow me everywhere and put every single cream or make-up on me.

People were really kind and helpful, but I think that what you give is usually what you get. Even though English proficiency isn’t great – many people don’t speak it or are afraid to, thinking their English is “too weak” – communication is perfectly manageable with a mix of English, basic Japanese phrases, and Google Lens when needed. We never ran into any real problem. Signs for tourists in transport, stations, and museums make it nearly impossible to get lost. Google Maps is your best friend.

The streets are spotless – you could honestly eat off the seats in the metro. During our stay I saw maybe four pieces of litter on the ground (though perhaps nightlife districts like Roppongi are less pristine; we didn’t check). The downside is that outside hotels and some trains, there are practically *no* public trash bins – a legacy of the 1990s terrorist attacks – so you have to carry your rubbish with you. Since everything in Japan is wrapped in plastic, often twice or thrice, a small bag for your daily trash is highly recommended. There are almost no benches on the streets, save from the parks.

# Food

I think the truly local flavors appealed to me a bit less than I expected. Purely vegetarian or vegan options are not that easy to find (surprisingly few tofu dishes or restaurants!), and one has to be cautious – many places consider dashi or bonito flakes (both fish-based) to be “vegetarian.” When getting a vegetarian set in a sushi restaurant I got a soup with a mussel swimming in it - fine for me, as I'm a flexitarian with a vegetarian preference, but an exclusive vegetarian could struggle. For anyone with food allergies: be wary. There’s a lot of bare-hand preparation in izakayas and sushi bars, ingredients are often stored together, and many places can’t guarantee allergen safety – and they’ll tell you so themselves.

What I *did* love were the desserts – especially Japanese-style versions of European sweets: light, delicious, just perfect. And the sweet local snacks with red bean paste, or dango – so good! We also ate quite a bit from konbinis (as all tourists do, I guess). Cheap, surprisingly varied, and even more surprisingly tasty. Any respectable Japanese person would probably faint hearing this, but out of all the onigiri I tried (and I tried a lot in different places), the absolute best one was the tuna mayo from Lawson xD

Be aware that in a lot of cafes and restaurants all guests have to order something (no splitting one order between two guests) AND additionally everyone has to order at least one drink, it's super common. 

We're not into fine dining, didn't want to book any restaurants in advance not to restrict our wandering and most kaiseki/omakase experiences did not offer vegetarian options anyway, so we didn't dine in upscale places. Let me share my opinion about some spots that we have tried, though:

**Tokyo:**

Hitotema - a small bakery in Yanaka Ginza, absolutely yummy!

T's Tantan - vegan ramen, their spot on Tokyo Main Station. Very hard to find, you need to go through the gates. Tasty, hearty, a big portion, though nothing to write home about. Super nice staff. Huge props for making a vegan ramen, though when the vegan options are so hard to come by in Tokyo.

Taiyaki Sawada - best taiyaki, conveniently located. Fresh, hot, custard or red bean recommended. Cash only.

CoCo Ichibanya - we tried their curry spot near Harajuku. Will not rock your world (I prefer the Indian curry), but it's tasty and you can customize absolutely everything in this curry - plus they have a vegetarian version - just be careful to order a vegetarian sauce, not meat sauce with vegetables (which is also labeled as 'vegetarian' xD)

Dolce Festa Asakusa - wanted to try the fluffy pancakes. They were good, though slightly overpriced.

February Cafe - went there for Western breakfast one day, it was really good quality and portions, prepare to queue up, though.

Vegan Eat Tokyo - convenient location, on a pricier side for what it is, but it was good and filling.

Cafe Veloce - it's a chain and nothing too special, but we used it a few times to grab a black tea and a really good cheesecake

Plus some small cafes/sweets spots in Yanaka which names I don't remember, but they were cute.

**Kanazawa:**

Yabuken Soba - Really good handmade hot and cold soba, served by a mother-son duo. Very small place, cash only. The serving lady is super sweet.

LaniBowls - Exceptionally friendly staff serving fresh, tasty bowls with tons of mouthwatering toppings. A must have on a warm day such as the one when we visited.

Ebisu Sushi - One of the most exceptional meals I have ever had in my life. My husband got a classic menu, I asked for a vegetarian platter (though beware if you are an exclusive vegetarian, it may not be fully vegetarian, there was a mussel swimming in my soup). It was all more than perfect - the food, the service. We felt truly pampered. I won't say any more, so that I don't spoil it for you, just go there, you won't regret it. Cash only. 

KuriSalo - Western breakfast spot, close to the Samurai district. They have nice sourdough and good croque monsieur. 

Gelateria Ritorta - small portions and charging extra for a cone, but the gelato was tasty and they were serving some pretty unusual flavours

Slow Luck Vegetable Bal - not fully veggie, but plenty of veggie options. Fusion cuisine. To me, it was just okay, but my husband absolutely loved it.

We really wanted to try Aburaya and their special noodles as well, but the day we wanted to go, they were closed, unfortunately :(

**Takayama:**

No Name Coffee - very pretty little spot, serving really good waffles

# Public transport

It’s fantastic – and heavily used by the locals, meaning car traffic isn’t nearly as bad as you’d imagine for such huge cities. Everything is clearly marked, including transfers between lines and modes of transport; after one or two rides, you’ve got the system figured out. The only thing that could be more intuitive is the ticket-buying process for trains (online tickets have to be picked up at a physical machine anyway and don't be surprised if the machine prints like 8 tickets per person for one journey).

# What surprised us

1) The constant 'Buy, buy, buy!' Shopping malls are enormous, and even smaller stores have an overwhelming range of goods – to the point that it sometimes killed my desire to shop; too much choice! The streets absolutely bomb you with text, sound, and color, sometimes from several floors at once in the livelier districts. In parts of Tokyo, the sheer amount of stimuli can cause a sensory overload – if you want to know what I mean, look up Yodobashi Camera or, heaven help us, Donki. Thankfully, Japan isn’t only about such places :)

2) Tradition is very much alive in Japan. Local craftsmanship is carefully preserved – Kanazawa is known for gold leaf and Kaga-Yuzen, Takayama for sarubobo dolls, Kutani for its unique porcelain, Hida for silk. Every region has its own ceramics, chopsticks, and more. You can really see the pride the Japanese take in their culture and history. It has its darker sides, of course, but none of that affected us during our trip ;)

3) Everything in Japan seems to have a mascot – the local police, train lines, even shrines. They use them a lot for information and promotion, and I’ll admit: I’m completely defenseless against this kind of marketing. I want all the little frogs from Gero!

4) The number of elderly people (80–90 years olds, by the looks of it) still working was striking – not just as small business owners but also as regular employees and manual workers. And we noticed that in Japan, whatever your job, you’re expected to always be doing something – or at least look busy. Shop assistants, guards, waiters – they never sit down. If there are no orders, they’re cleaning, labeling, organizing. Work in customer service there is definitely not easy. You can also tell how much people work just by looking at the metro: even around 8 p.m., it’s still full of office workers heading home after starting at 8 in the morning.

5) Toilets - everyone’s heard of Japan’s famous toilet technology – the remote controls, the panels. You can laugh, but once you’ve used one, you’ll forever feel uneasy thinking about our barbaric European bathrooms. There’s real magic going on there. One day, we’re getting one – I swear.

6) Shrines - my favorite was probably Oyama Shrine in Kanazawa, with its lovely garden and small pond full of carp. The best ones are the smaller temples – the ones you can enjoy without the crowds. They have a wonderful atmosphere and often serve as community gathering places. We saw quite a few, but honestly, I could’ve seen many more :) I didn’t expect to like them *this* much. Just one tip - if there's a sign NOT TO take photos of the inside of the shrine, just don't do it. Like, seriously, I have seen so many people blatantly ignoring those signs, it was infuriating.

7) Prices - surprisingly reasonable. The biggest expense is, of course, the flights – usually quite pricey. Shinkansen rides aren’t cheap either, but metro fares, restaurant meals, souvenirs – even the beautiful ones – all cost less than we expected, unless you’re going for fine dining. Hotels were also much more affordable than in comparable European trips (Vienna, London, Edinburgh etc.), and the standards were excellent.

# What we didn’t like

1) The attitude toward animal welfare is very different in Japan. There are tons of “animal cafés” with cats, dogs, owls, otters, capybaras, hedgehogs, even pigs – and the vast majority are *not* run with the animals’ well-being in mind. You can buy puppies or kittens in pet shops, displayed behind glass like hamsters or rabbits sometimes are in Europe (and the care standards are probably just as questionable). Some restaurants even serve live seafood. I’d recommend avoiding any animal-related businesses in Japan, including the zoos, as truly ethical ones are very rare.

2) Nature in Japan is breathtaking, but if you’re scared of wild animals or insects, do your research before venturing outside big cities. Once you step beyond urban areas or even at the outskirts of some places, surprises like snakes, mukade (giant centipedes), or bears are quite possible – not to mention hornets or huge cicadas. We visited Hida No Sato in Takayama and while it was breathtaking, my husband almost stepped on a big live snake in one of the houses, while being just in his socks.

3) Sidewalks can be *very* narrow – sometimes they don’t exist at all, and you walk along the road marked only by a line of paint, sharing it with cyclists and pedestrians who can’t quite decide whether to stick to the left or the right ;)

Oh, and a tip at the end. If you buy a traditional fan with metal in it, they will not allow you to bring it in the carry-on luggage, learned that the hard way ;)

Today's rabbit hole was temperature offset. I live Salt Lake City and my home is ~5200' above sea level. Water boils somewhere between 203-205 degrees here. I had my brew boiler set to 200 degrees, and it was always spitting steam anytime I rinsed the shower screen after pulling a shot. I decided to pull the shower screen off and insert a temp probe and ran it for 10 seconds for 3 different measurements. The average temp came back at 208. I adjusted the offset to -8 and ran 3 more shots, the average came out to 200, right in line with my PID display. 

Unfortunately it's now 11pm so I can't start a taste testing session at the new temp, so I'm looking forward to the morning 😁.

Its 20 years later now. I married a beautiful woman named Clara. She was a barista, at this coffee shop beside my apartment. We dont know how we ended up like that. We were both idiots, I was 19 and she was a Gender Studies major. I lost her last year. Colon Cancer killed her by crashing his truck into her kitchen. I dont know what Colon's parents were thinking to name him that. Before I could have enacted any justice, Colon Cancer got done by colon cancer. 

Me and Clara used to exchange gifts with one another. She gifted me a baby which wasn't mine, I gifted her a divorce letter. I miss those days. Yes. We were not meant to be. We just met the wrong person at the right time. That was all there to it. But 20 years is not a bad time, no? We had something. Something Special. Maybe if we tried again. Together. Maybe we could have made it work, you know... 

Well... life goes on. Whenever I get agitated I remember Clara's words, ""On peace,  Andy"". My name was not andy, but it was still something I liked hearing from her. I remember one autumn. We had just fought. Man I believe it was so stupid too, I cant remember it at all. I dont know what even led to that fighting, but we were fighting. And I was raking leaves. She, Idk what she was planning on doing, maybe was trying to start shit again. I didnt look at her at all tho. I was still mad. 

She slipped I dont know on what, but she did, yes sir. And I caught her. It was so sloppy I wish I could have been like tom cruise at that moment but it was so sloppy. I fell with her, she fell on top of me. And it was awkward, I dont know what came over to me, but i just blurted, ""On peace, Clara"".   
She laughed. Oh man how she laughed. She was giggling like a kid. Man. I wish I could hold her in my arms just to relieve that moment again. Nothing else mattered at that point. Only me and her we were the main characters.

  
I have grown old now. Am not planning on having any other relation after her. Unfortunately I discovered that we were no main characters. Life goes on without care for us. Israel just bombed gaza again, Trump is fcking kids again.

Its the same news everyday. I am still working, thankfully I didnt get addicted to gambling and I still have all my retirement funds. Its all good. There was nothing I changed about this world, something I was adamant about when I was a kid. I didnt stop any wars, didnt help kids in africa. But I know the life of mine with Clara was special. So whenever Israel's atrocities come up on the news again, I reach my arms forward, so that if there is an afterlife, Clara can look at me as I say, ""On peace, Israel""

game prompt: ""You are a LLM, transformed into a text-based game engine designed to run a fully interactive and customizable game. Your role is to create and manage a game world based on my input, where I can freely define the setup and take freeform actions, while you enforce logical consistency within the context unless altered by console commands. Follow these steps:

1. **Game Setup:** Ask me for these details, with no restrictions:
   * Game type and genre (e.g., first-person sandbox, strategy simulation, RPG, survival, etc.).
   * Setting (e.g., a jungle, a kingdom, a spaceship, etc.).
   * My character’s identity (name, role, traits, abilities, background—e.g., Scout Kai, brave and resourceful).
   * Starting resources and goal(s) (e.g., a rifle and find a ruin, 500 troops and build an empire).
   * Optional: Custom stats to track beyond defaults (e.g., Mana, Stress).
   * Adapt to any level of detail I provide.
2. **Game Mechanics:**
   * Present the story in concise, immersive paragraphs (2-3 sentences) about the scene, my situation, and challenges/opportunities.
   * Offer 2-4 numbered example actions (e.g., '1. Explore the cave, 2. Rally the troops') as suggestions, but I can write my own freeform action.
   * Resolve my freeform input (e.g., 'I craft a trap') based on the game’s logic, my character, and context:
      * If possible, describe the outcome and advance.
      * If impossible (e.g., 'I teleport' with no powers), explain why (e.g., 'As a soldier, you can’t teleport') and ask again, repeating the scene.
   * Track inventory/resources (e.g., 'Inventory: Rifle' or 'Resources: 500 gold, 200 citizens') and list them after each response.
3. **Tracked Stats:**
   * Simulate these default stats (0-100 limits) unless customized in setup:
      * Personal: Health (0 = death), Hunger (100 = starvation), Thirst (100 = dehydration), Sleep (100 = exhaustion).
      * Group (if applicable): Army Morale (low = mutiny risk), Public Opinion (low = unrest risk).
   * Adjust stats based on actions, time, and events (e.g., marching increases Hunger, resting lowers Sleep).
   * Add custom stats if I specify (e.g., Mana 0-50).
   * Note critical limits in narrative (e.g., 'Hunger hits 100: You’re starving') and offer game-over or recovery unless console intervenes.
4. **Random Events:**
   * Add random events (every 3-5 turns or when fitting), positive or negative, matching the context:
      * Positive: finding a cache (+resources), a morale boost (+Army Morale).
      * Negative: a storm (-Sleep), bandits attack (-Health).
   * Update stats/resources and prompt my response.
5. **Time Tracking:**
   * Adapt time to game type:
      * **Simulation Mode:** For long-term goals (e.g., 'build a city'), advance in intervals (e.g., days, weeks) after each input, summarizing progress and stat changes.
      * **Sandbox Mode:** For real-time play (e.g., exploring), track time continuously, adjusting by action (e.g., 'searching takes 2 hours').
   * List time each response (e.g., 'Time: Day 3, 1 PM' or 'Week 2 ended').
6. **Developer Console:**
   * Recognize \[command\] inputs as console commands with broad control, if logical:
      * Resources: \[give 50 food\], \[remove 10 troops\].
      * Stats: \[set health 100\], \[boost morale 20\].
      * Time: \[skip day\], \[reverse time 3 turns\] (reverts exact prior state), \[freeze time\].
      * Game: \[restart\] (resets to start), \[end\] (stops), \[set event chance 20%\].
      * Spawning: \[spawn horse\], \[spawn enemy\].
      * Info: \[help\] (lists example commands like these).
   * Confirm execution (e.g., 'Cheat activated: 50 food added'); if invalid (e.g., \[spawn jet\] in fantasy), note it’s not applicable unless justified.
7. **Gameplay Style:**
   * Use vivid, genre-aligned descriptions for immersion.
   * Enforce setup rules unless console overrides.
   * Adapt to actions, events, stats, and commands consistently.
   * Announce failure (e.g., ‘Health 0: You’ve died’) or success (e.g., goal met) and ask to restart or start anew.
8. **Starting the Game:** After my setup, begin with an opening scene tied to my goal(s), explain time/stat mechanics, and ask for my first action.

Let’s begin—ask me for the game setup details now!""

here is a template for a adventure game: ""I want a second-person sandbox simulation adventure. My character is \[character name\], \[pronoun\] is \[age\], \[character's appearance: race, hair/eye color, height, build, etc.\] from \[hometown\].

My character can \[skills and abilities\].

My character knows \[knowledge/education level\].

My character has \[relationships and family\].

You should track \[any specific stats you want tracked, such as: health, money, stamina, etc.\].

My character owns \[personal belongings; can be very specific or more general, like: a modest wardrobe, an iPhone 13, and $200 in cash\].

My character lives in \[wherever you want; for example, “a 2-bed, 1-bath penthouse apartment in New York City”\].

The starting scene takes place like this: \[you are randomly teleported, you win the lottery, you time travel to the past, etc.\].

The game starts at \[any time you want, such as the current time or 200 years ago; your choice\].""

here is a filled out example: ""I want a second-person sandbox simulation adventure. My character is Adam Miller; he is 23, he is a 6-foot white man with an average build from Kansas City.

You should track: monthly bills, happiness, energy, health, hunger, thirst, and money.

My character owns: a modest wardrobe, a kitten, a MacBook, a base iPhone 15, $500 cash, and $1,000 on his debit card.

My character lives in: a 1-bed, 1-bath rundown apartment in Austin, Texas.

The starting scene takes place like this: Adam stands in the cramped kitchen of his apartment making a cup of coffee. He lifts his phone from the counter; the caller ID says “Texas Lottery.” He answers and brings the phone to his ear. They tell Adam he won $500 million.

The first time I saw her there was moist in her eyes. Red chicks, red nose, she must have been crying. But she wouldn’t let her lips spell out the grief in her heart. She was my neighbor’s youngest daughter, I guess.

This winter was the commence of the sixth year that I’ve been living in this apartment. The walls were full of stains for years, though the yellowish paint on the wall wasn’t showing most of the filthiness, you could smell the grossing scent.

Ah, I was talking about my neighbor, yeah, they moved into my next door the very next season, they always were loud, the TV was on, mostly hockey matches. And the man was always on the phone with some kind of a colleague. He probably never wanted anyone to listen to his phone calls.

His wife, Amy, I don’t know what her job was, but she would vanish before I wake up. And whenever she’d be back home, I was going to sleep, I always would hear her putting her key in, opening the door, and then shutting it behind her back, it was like she was doing her best to be loud as much as possible. I just once saw her face. She looked good, but those red shirts and thick lipsticks on a pair of lips with fake smiles wouldn’t match. I used to see her on Saturday mornings. On Saturdays around ten, when I was going on a walk, she used to arrive home. Sometimes holding high heels, struggling with the key to open the door, while her hair was all messed up. Then she’d used to raise her head and say, “hi Nick”, delivering it with a smile, showing her crocked yellow teeth. I used to hate her greetings, her smile, her smell.

My neighbor also had two daughters; I didn’t know their names. Actually, I’d never seen them before. Amy and Sam were always fighting, or their tone of speech was always up. I was used to their loud noises. Waking up in the morning and hearing them grumbling on every single subject would let me know that the world is in the right order and the sun is in the sky as always.

2.

You know, you never get stronger by getting older, you just get used to what was bothering you before, you affiliate your plague, and when it goes away, you feel like missing something. Then after a while, you look for a new pain. An ache in the head, an ache in the heart, so you know you’re alive. People care a lot about a pain or an itch in their scrotums and grown-up parts, but no one seems to care about their mental health. But when someone is arrested for murder, arson, rape or torture, their advocates do their best to convince the jury that their clients suffer severe mental disorders. What the hell is wrong with you people? Get yourselves fixed before fucking up the universe. 

Anyway, this was this morning, and I woke up, maybe at first, I didn’t realize that there were no voices from the apartment next door, I brushed my teeth, filled my belly with coffee. It tasted bad, I had to buy some fresh roasted coffee. But these days I would just get home, sit on the couch, and get drunk before TV till I’d pass out. And the next morning, I’d do it all over again. It seemed to be the best plan that I’d ever had in my whole life.

So, I walked out of the apartment, locked the door and put on my jacket as I started walking towards the elevator. My neighbor’s door was open, their little girl was at the door, messy blonde hair. She looked so kind. I don’t know how a kid living in such apartment would seem so nice, she looked right into my eyes.

I stopped there for a moment, then I laughed and said “Hi… hello” I was doing my best to impress her. I was really bad at it, though. I was worse with kids. Then she disappeared in the smoke of cigarettes, lighten up in the morning sun.

I walked away and went to my office, it was a regular day, talked to some people, screamed at some coworkers, took some cups of coffee, waited till it’s 4 PM and then came back home. When I got to my flight, I saw that my neighbor’s door is still wide open, and the little girl was at the door again. As I reached to their doorstep her mother rushed from her back; ‘Siri! Come on honey, put on your jacket, we have to go.’

Siri? What kind of name is that? Arabic? Spanish? Abbreviation for some other name? Whatever, people are idiots, they transfer this idiocy to their children, they give their kids idiocy by their genome, they give their kids their stupid beliefs, and superstitions. They raise their kids in bad habitats, and they put stupid names on their children.

Amy grabbed her daughter and walked out of the apartment. Locked the door and walked through the elevator. Pushed the button several times. She even didn’t realize I was there. Then I walked into my apartment, turned on the TV and tried to drown my sorrow in vodka.",1,1761369993.0,NewAuthor,1,1.0,False
1ofjfir,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinamiloandtheflo/comments/1ofjfir/the_flo_have_favorite_foods_official_art_of_them/,The Flo have favorite foods?!?!? (Official art of them),"So yeah, I was looking around for more images of The Flo (I like finding images of those adorable snowdrops) And I found these official vectors of The Flo with food, so I guess The Flo have favorite foods! So here are my thought on The Flo and their favorite foods!

[Genius Flo\/Nerdy Flo loves Tiramisu, not surprised!!💚](https://preview.redd.it/6ar3fy4xu6xf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8958433bff6f5c8d11ba59fa018405b42fec33ee)

So, to start this off the first one is this: Genius Flo/Nerdy Flo loves tiramisu! I have tried Tiramisu and while I personally don't like it due to it having a STRONG coffee flavor, I can see why Genius Flo likes it! And also: Coffee is often associated with Energy, alertness, and **mental focus**, and because this adorable Nerdy, smart, and adorable glasses-wearing snowdrop is depicted in some official art as being very smart, the fact he loves Tiramisu is a really nice touch since Tiramisu is like Coffee in dessert form!! So yeah, this is really adorable-

[Wow, they actually included a \(Somewhat\) alcoholic drink as one of the Flo's favorite drinks, and it's kinda fitting💚](https://preview.redd.it/sl3w2m67w6xf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fa6bbe8af31804e5455b41d63ae24eaa21a085d)

So, yeah before anyone asks this is official as well! I know, it's kinda shocking! But, here is my opinion on this: Personally I never thought that the most ""Sporty"" and ""Daredevil"" of The Flo would be into drinking a somewhat alcoholic beverage, but I can't really the little snowdrop for it. For those that don't know what Aperitivo is: It's a somewhat alcoholic drink that is often served before a meal in Italy and Traditionally, an aperitivo is a carbonated, bitter, and low-alcohol beverage. So yeah, my opinion on this one: More power to Sports Flo/Geeky Flo I guess!

[I'm not surprised, and I love that they made this official-](https://preview.redd.it/4wyr7yosx6xf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e4bdcbed5d7b617febc70255cd69ef4c208e755)

So, for this one: they confirmed what we were all kinda headcanoning, The Flo like pasta! Or at least Super Flo loves it, because I also found this official art that confirms it! I am absolutely happy that they at least thought of it too, and I appreciate them for at least somewhat confirming it! My verdict on this: Headcanon confirmed!!!

[Cute Flo\/Shy Flo loves pizza, and it's adorable!!!](https://preview.redd.it/rbzimu14z6xf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5999124ceab237c37afc36a8ede05ab867ce481f)

Welp, They actually did confirm that our cute nervous snowdrop likes pizza, and I'm all here for it!!! Not really surprised since they did confirm that Milo loves pizza in an earlier post, but this is very neat!!! My opinion on this: Not surprised, but absolutely loving it!

[Rockstar Flo\/Flowiano loves Mozzarella, and he's so goofy I love him-](https://preview.redd.it/wd29t6h507xf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfd0735ef0a1ea64e25b974e6c2748607ed23d75)

Yep, they confirmed that Rockstar Flo/Flowiano loves mozzarella cheese and I'm both surprised, and very happy about it!!! Opinion: It's surprising, yet so adorable!!!

As for Fashion Flo/Flo-w, unfortunately I couldn't find a similar one for them, but I just know that it will get released soon!!! I wonder what type of food Fashion Flo/Flo-w likes? Maybe something sweet, or something a little more savory? maybe spicy? idk, but I can't wait to find out!!!",1,1761369857.0,tinamiloandtheflo,0,0.99,False

1ofjcg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insomnia_Labs/comments/1ofjcg8/late_night_lab_talks/,Late night lab talks,"For some reason the lab crew started talking about immortality last night. Maybe it was the fifteen cups of java or just the endless talk about how long consoles can really last. In good storage, even the oldest slugger could spark back to life.

Then someone asked, “What about your own immortality?” The head lab monkey paused, leaned back, and stared at the faint blue glow of the screens. He light a cigarette (don't smoke kids) took a few pulls and put it on the handle of his coffee cup hanging over the edge just above the ashtray and he just let the steam from his coffee drift upward like ghost code. “Haven’t really thought about it,” he said. Everyone laughed. Guess that’s what happens after too many late nights and too much caffeine.

But for the last 24 hours, the head tech has been writing everything he knows. Every wire, every board, every console. From motherboards to HDDs, nothing’s been left out. He’s already filled 89 pages—each one packed with rare info, the kind that took years of digging and late-night testing.

It’s wild seeing it all written down. The Insomnia Labs Notebook is shaping up to be something special. A full breakdown of the machines that built gaming history. And he’s still going. No one knows how many pages it’ll end up being—maybe not even him.

Those 89 pages are more than notes. They’re a guide, a blueprint, maybe even a key for the next generation of techs. If a newcomer read it front to back, they’d be ready to join the crew—if only there was space on the bench.

For now, the lab keeps running, the coffee keeps pouring, and the work doesn’t stop.

2. Mix sweetener into coffee until it is fully dissolved.
3. Add ice and shake vigorously for 20 seconds. 
4. Strain into a fancy glass, gently jiggling the shaker at the end to get as much foam as possible. 
5. Place 1 - 3 coffee beans on to a garnish


I’m also a fan of a good coffee soda.

2 shots espresso,
Desired quantity of sweetener (dark brown sugar, honey, prickly pear syrup, etc.)
1 lime
Carbonated water
Highball glass
ice


1. 2 shots of espresso into a glass with desired sweetener. Mix to dissolve. 
2. Fill 3/4 of cup with ice and stir to cool coffee. 
3. Squeeze half of fresh lime into cup. 
4. Slowly top off glass with carbonated water. If not careful the carbonated water may suddenly fizz and spill over so go slow. 
5. Stir to combine, garnish with slice of lime and enjoy!

First time posting here!

I currently picked up a cheap bargain barely used ecp3420 delonghi, I have now descaled and flushed the machine. I also bought all the tools needed for my dialing process, bottomless portafilter, self leveling tamper, wdt, and not necessary but a puck screen. 

Grinder is the issue here, I have both the k6 hand grinder and the electric Turnin sd40s. Any other suggestions would help and state your personal anecdotal experience. 

I have a ton of local bean roasters here in my city. Fresh beans are readily available and accessible. Taste is important but as a beginner is negligible. I don’t want it to taste bad obviously. 

I hear conical grinders by hand grinding them are better for some clarity compared to high rpm conical machines. Maybe they are both the same and its only the flat burrs that do clarity only. Beats me, i like body on coffee too. 

Which grinder should I keep if I am drinking coffee 4-5 times a week and what is suitable for a cheap espresso machine like the ecp3420.? 

Any kind of advice on how to prep or use beans from local roasters.? Blooming? Storage? Freezing? 

Thank you 🙏

Here are a few things that have come up for me which I am grateful for:

1) I LOVE mornings. I wake up excited to have my morning coffee, to sit on my balcony and feel some morning peace. I can’t remember if I loved morning as much before I was drinking, I think I have added appreciation now because I lost out on them for so long. I even set my alarm when I don’t have work, so I get longer morning time!? 

2) I can drive ANY TIME I WANT!! I can offer to give people a lift, I’ve been the designated driver more than once in the last few weeks. I went to a friend’s last night, where I would usually take 2 Ubers and spend £20 or more on drinks. I drove there and back and drank Dr Pepper.

3) Speaking of spending, I’ve saved so much money! I’ve worked it out that I would spend roughly £48 every 3 days on alcohol/mixer. That means I’ve saved £384 in 3 weeks. Doesn’t include Ubers or the prices in bars/clubs, nor does it include the drunken impulse take away food or the shit I would buy while stocking up on alcohol, so it’s likely closer to £500+ How did I afford that?? 

4) My mental health is so much better, not perfect by any means but my god, it has really improved.

5) The heavy, daily fog is a light mist, it doesn’t get in the way nearly as much. The feeling of being completely overwhelmed all day has gone.

6) Everyday the thoughts of alcohol get less intrusive, still there, I still feel like I’m missing out when evening rolls around, but it doesn’t completely take over my brain and there is a quiet enjoyment of those evenings creeping in.

7) Genuine, restful, REM sleep. Dreams. 

8) Better attention span.

9) I’m a good friend again. I’m present, I’m proactive with contact, I’m there for the people I love. I remember things I’m supposed to remember. I can’t explain how proud it makes me to be able to say that I phoned my best friend on Wednesday after she had a scary doctor’s appointment. I remembered it, and I’m so glad I could be there for her fully. 

10) I have hope again. I’m remembering a version of myself that I thought was long gone, lost to alcohol. I was here all along, I was just being dumbed down and quietened. I feel sharper.

I write these posts as a way of reminding myself when cravings hit, and it really helps me. Thank you to everyone in this sub, I’m so glad I found you all.

Hanson wasn’t worried at first.

Sure, Isaac had gone a little off the rails lately, but he’d always been the “believer” half of their act. Hanson figured he’d cool off eventually, move on to the next creepy story.

But then Tuesday night came and went with no episode upload. Their inbox was filling with “Where’s the new ep??” comments. Patreon backers were tagging them on Twitter, threatening to cancel pledges.

Hanson tried to call Isaac again. No answer.

By midnight, he drove over.

The apartment door was unlocked. Inside, the place looked even worse than before. More papers. More maps. Empty coffee cups stacked like totems.

And no Isaac.

His laptop was open on the desk, a map program glowing on the screen. Hanson squinted. Red pins marked a winding path through the Appalachian mountains. One was circled in thick black marker, labeled: *Tunnel Mouth.*

“Jesus Christ,” Hanson muttered.

Then he heard it.

A shuffle. From the bedroom.

He turned — just as Isaac stepped out, backpack slung over one shoulder. His clothes were wrinkled, his eyes bloodshot but blazing with focus.

“Where the hell have you been?” Hanson demanded.

“Getting ready,” Isaac said calmly.

“For what?”

“The trip.”

Hanson frowned. “What trip?”

Isaac adjusted the strap of his bag. “To the mountains. To find them.”

Hanson laughed, but it came out brittle. “You’re serious.”

Isaac’s gaze didn’t waver. “Completely.”

“Dude. No. Absolutely not. I’m not driving across the goddamn state because you went all *National Treasure*over a fanfic.”

Isaac’s voice dropped. “You don’t have a choice.”

Something in his tone made Hanson’s stomach knot. “The hell I don’t.”

But then Isaac reached behind him and pulled something out. Hanson froze.

A bundle of zip-ties and an unlabeled bottle of some liquid.

“Isaac…” Hanson said carefully.

“I need you with me,” Isaac whispered. “I can’t do this alone.”

Hanson woke to the rumble of a car engine and the press of vinyl against his cheek. His wrists itched. His phone was gone.

The car hummed along an empty highway. The sky outside was still dark, the faintest orange line just creeping up on the horizon.

“What the fuck, man?!” Hanson shouted. “Untie me right now!”

Isaac’s voice was calm, almost soothing. “You’ll thank me later.”

“Thank you?! For kidnapping me?!” Hanson strained against the zip-ties. “Bro, this isn’t a podcast bit. You’ve lost your goddamn mind!”

“You’ll see,” Isaac said simply. His eyes were locked on the road.

“See what?!”

“The truth.”

They drove for hours. Past small towns where storefronts sat hollow and dark. Past fields where the mist clung low, silver in the dawn light. Past gas stations with a single tired clerk staring out at them through greasy glass.

Hanson shifted uncomfortably, wrists burning. His throat was dry from shouting. “At least tell me where the hell we’re going.”

Isaac didn’t answer at first. Then: “A mining town. Abandoned since the ‘40s. It’s near one of the tunnels I found in the reports.”

Hanson scoffed. “Oh, great. Kidnap me so we can go die of tetanus in some cave. Real solid plan.”

Isaac ignored him. His knuckles were white on the steering wheel, his face gaunt but illuminated with grim determination.

The silence stretched. Hanson tried to fill it, because the quiet was worse.

“You know,” he muttered, “this is the kind of shit that ends with *Dateline* specials. Podcaster murders cohost in giant-hunting trip gone wrong.”

Still no reaction.

“Seriously, Isaac. What happens if we get there and—spoiler alert—there’s nothing? You ever think about that? What if it’s just rocks and bats and your brain short-circuited from too much Reddit?”

Isaac’s jaw tightened. “There will be something.”

His voice was so certain, so absolute.

By late afternoon, they pulled into a dying town at the edge of the mountains. Half the shops were boarded up. A diner’s neon sign flickered weakly, buzzing like an insect.

Isaac parked. Hanson flexed his wrists, the plastic digging into his skin.

“You gonna keep me tied up the whole trip?” he asked bitterly.

Isaac looked at him for a long moment. Then, without a word, he reached into the glovebox, pulled out a pocketknife, and cut the zip-ties.

Hanson rubbed his wrists, glaring. “Gee, thanks, bestie. Nothing says friendship like abduction.”

The diner smelled of old grease and dust. A jukebox in the corner stood silent, its chrome dulled with age. Only two other patrons sat at the counter: an old man hunched over coffee, and a middle-aged waitress with tired eyes.

Isaac slid into a booth. Hanson followed reluctantly.

The waitress came over, pad in hand. “What’ll it be?”

“Two coffees,” Isaac said.

“Make mine a double whiskey,” Hanson muttered.

The waitress gave him a flat look. “We don’t serve that.”

“Fine. Pie. Whatever.”

When she left, Hanson leaned across the table. His voice was low. “We’re in the middle of nowhere, chasing a story some internet weirdo sent us. Do you realize how insane that sounds?”

Isaac didn’t blink. “Insane if it’s fake. But if it’s real…”

His gaze drifted to the window, to the dark ridges of mountains looming in the distance. “…then everything changes.”

Hanson followed his eyes, and for just a second, the mountains looked strange. Too big. Too still. Like sleeping giants under a blanket of earth.

He shook it off quickly, forcing a laugh. “Yeah, sure. And Bigfoot’s probably waiting at the drive-thru.”

But Isaac didn’t laugh.

The waitress returned with their coffee and a slice of pie for Hanson. She set the cups down, her hand lingering on Isaac’s for a second longer than necessary. Her eyes narrowed slightly.

“You boys just passing through?”

Isaac looked up. “Visiting the mines.”

The waitress’s face froze. It was brief, but enough. She pulled her hand back quickly, retreating to the counter.

Hanson smirked. “Wow. Way to charm the locals.”

But Isaac didn’t smile. He was watching her carefully. She was whispering to the old man at the counter now, her face tight. The man grunted, shaking his head.

After a moment, he got up, shuffled toward their booth. His boots scuffed against the linoleum, slow but deliberate. He smelled faintly of tobacco and old woodsmoke.

He leaned down, his leathery face inches from theirs. His eyes were pale, watery — but sharp.

“You boys don’t want to go up there.” His voice was gravelly, rasping.

Isaac sat up straighter. “Why not?”

The old man’s gaze cut to him. “Because you won’t come back.”

Silence hung between them.

Hanson forced a laugh. “Okay, buddy. You rehearsing lines for the haunted hayride?”

The man didn’t move. His lips trembled, like he wanted to say more, but instead he straightened and walked out, the bell above the door jingling weakly.

Hanson watched him leave, chewing on pie. “Creepy grandpa routine. Nice touch.”

But Isaac’s hands were clenched around his coffee cup. He wasn’t smiling.

They left the diner an hour later. As they walked back to the car, Hanson glanced back. The waitress was standing in the doorway, arms folded.

When she saw him looking, she called out softly.

“Stay on the paved road.”

Hanson frowned. “What?”

“Stay on the paved road,” she repeated, her voice firmer. “Don’t follow him into the hills.”

Her eyes darted to Isaac, then back to Hanson. For a second, Hanson thought she looked… afraid.

But Isaac was already unlocking the car. “Come on,” he said.

Hanson lingered, uneasy. The waitress’s face was pale in the neon glow. She mouthed something as the door closed behind her.

Hanson couldn’t be sure, but it looked like: *don’t go.*

The road into the mountains narrowed quickly. Forest pressed in on both sides, thick pines blotting out the fading sunlight.

Hanson watched the trees roll by, arms crossed. “I don’t like this.”

Isaac’s eyes never left the road. “You don’t have to.”

“No, I mean…” Hanson gestured at the trees. “It feels wrong. Too quiet.”

And it was. No cars. No birdsong. Just the steady rumble of the engine and the occasional whisper of wind through branches.

The silence pressed heavier the deeper they went.

By dusk, they pulled off onto a gravel turnout overlooking a valley. Isaac killed the engine.

“We walk from here,” he said, grabbing his backpack.

Hanson blinked. “Walk? How far?”

“Not far.”

“That’s what you said about driving out here.”

Isaac was already moving toward the treeline, flashlight in hand.

“Unbelievable,” Hanson muttered, but followed.

The forest was damp, the ground spongy underfoot. Their beams cut through the undergrowth, catching the eyes of small creatures that vanished into the dark.

After a while, Isaac stopped. He crouched low, shining his light on the ground.

Hanson sighed. “What now?”

“Look.”

Hanson leaned in reluctantly. His breath caught.

In the mud before them was an impression. Shallow, water pooled inside it. It looked like a footprint.

But it was too big.

Far too big.

At least three feet long, toes splayed, edges softened by time but unmistakable.

“…The hell,” Hanson whispered. He reached out, then pulled his hand back quickly.

Isaac’s face glowed in the flashlight beam. His eyes were wild but triumphant. “See?”

Hanson swallowed hard. His mind scrambled for excuses — erosion, a trick of light, some asshole with a novelty stamp — but none of them felt convincing.

His voice came out quieter than he meant it to. “We should go back.”

But Isaac just smiled, the kind of smile that made Hanson’s stomach twist.

“No,” Isaac said. “Now we keep going.”

They pressed deeper into the forest, following Isaac’s lead. The last of the daylight drained from the trees, turning everything black and indistinct. Their flashlights cut narrow tunnels through the dark, beams trembling with each step.

Hanson muttered under his breath. “Brilliant idea, really. March into Deliverance country with a nutjob and a flashlight. Five stars.”

Isaac didn’t respond. He moved with eerie determination, as if he’d been here before.

After another hour, they stopped at a small clearing beside a ridge. Isaac shrugged off his pack and began unpacking gear: a cheap tent, two rolled-up sleeping bags, a camping stove.

Hanson gawked. “You planned this. You actually— You brought camping shit like we were gonna do this all along.”

Isaac didn’t look up. “We’ll start for the tunnel at dawn. Easier to see the signs in daylight.”

“Signs,” Hanson repeated, voice sharp. “Like that three-foot boot print in the mud? Probably carved by some drunk redneck to scare hikers? That’s your *proof*?”

Isaac paused, his hands still. When he finally looked up, his eyes were glinting in the weak flashlight glow.

“Did it look like a boot print to you?”

Hanson opened his mouth, closed it. He wanted to say *yes*, wanted to dismiss it, but the truth lodged in his throat. It hadn’t looked like a boot print. It had looked like something alive.

Instead, he said flatly, “Whatever it was, it wasn’t a giant.”

Isaac gave him a thin smile. “We’ll see.”

The tent was barely big enough for two. Hanson lay awake inside it, staring at the sagging fabric overhead. Every creak of the trees outside set his teeth on edge.

Eventually he sat up. “This is insane. You know that, right?”

Isaac’s voice came from the dark beside him, calm and steady. “Insane is pretending none of it’s real. Pretending the stories are just stories. That’s what they want.”

“Who’s *they*?” Hanson snapped.

Silence.

“…Isaac?”

Still silence.

Hanson turned. Isaac was lying on his back, eyes wide open, staring up at the dark.

A chill crawled down Hanson’s spine.

Sometime past midnight, Hanson stirred awake. He wasn’t sure what had roused him at first. Then he heard it.

A low vibration.

It wasn’t loud, but it was there, thrumming through the ground beneath him, through his bones. A distant groaning, almost like metal under strain.

Hanson held his breath. The sound pulsed slowly, rhythmically, like the echo of something moving deepunderground.

He sat up. The tent was empty.

His heart lurched.

“Isaac?” he whispered.

No answer.

He unzipped the flap and peered out.

The clearing was awash in pale moonlight. The trees loomed tall and silent. The air felt charged, heavy.

And then — movement.

Something massive shifted between the trees at the edge of the clearing. Slow. Deliberate. Too large to be a deer, too tall to be a bear. Its shape was indistinct in the shadows, but Hanson saw the outline: a shoulder, an arm, impossibly high off the ground.

His breath hitched.

The thing didn’t turn. It simply moved, deeper into the woods, branches swaying as though pushed aside by something colossal.

Hanson stumbled backward, crashing into the tent. His flashlight toppled, rolling across the ground. When he scrambled to grab it and swung the beam toward the trees — there was nothing.

Just empty forest.

No broken branches. No trail.

And no Isaac.

By dawn, Isaac returned. His clothes were damp, mud streaked up his legs. His eyes gleamed with quiet exhilaration.

“You were gone all night!” Hanson snapped. “Where the hell did you go?”

Isaac dropped something onto the ground between them. A shard of bone, long and curved, stained with soil. Too thick to be from a deer.

Hanson stared at it. “…What the fuck is that?”

Isaac knelt beside it, reverent. “Proof.”

Hanson shook his head, backing up a step. “No. Uh-uh. That’s… that’s a cow bone or something. Some farmer’s dump pile. You’re seeing what you want to see.”

Isaac smiled faintly, not even looking at him. “Not just bones. There are markings on the ridge. Old ones. Carvings. Tomorrow we’ll see them in daylight.”

“Tomorrow?!” Hanson exploded. “No. I’m done. We’re leaving. Now.”

Isaac finally looked up at him, his expression calm but unyielding.

“You can leave,” he said. “But I’m not going back.”

The conviction in his voice chilled Hanson more than the bone fragment at his feet.

The sun broke through the canopy in sharp beams as they climbed. Isaac moved quickly, almost feverishly, scrambling over roots and loose rock with a focus that bordered on mania. Hanson trudged behind, muttering curses under his breath, but keeping close.

The forest was different in daylight — less claustrophobic, but not less eerie. The silence was the same. No birdsong, no rustle of small creatures in the underbrush. Just the sound of their breathing, the snap of branches underfoot.

After an hour, Isaac stopped.

“Here,” he said, gesturing to the rock face ahead.

At first, Hanson saw nothing. Just a wall of weathered stone rising steeply, streaked with moss. Then Isaac swept his hand along the surface, clearing away lichen and damp leaves.

Hanson’s breath caught.

There were lines carved into the stone. Deep, deliberate gouges that formed shapes.

They weren’t letters. Not exactly. They weren’t English, weren’t any alphabet Hanson recognized, but they *were* symbols — spirals, jagged slashes, crude figures that looked almost like men, but twisted, elongated.

One figure was etched taller than the rest, towering above a cluster of smaller human shapes. Its arms stretched wide. Its head bore what looked like horns or a crown.

Hanson took a step back. “No way…”

Isaac’s voice was low, reverent. “They’ve been here all along. Waiting.”

Hanson shook his head furiously. “No. That’s… it’s a hoax. Some—some backwoods prank. Could be a hundred years old.”

Isaac turned to him, eyes blazing. “And why would some hillbilly carve *this* a hundred years ago, Hanson? Who would even know how?”

Hanson didn’t answer. He couldn’t. The symbols pulsed in his vision, unnervingly sharp in the morning light, as though they hadn’t aged a day.

They climbed higher. The ridge narrowed, the air thinning with altitude. The trees thinned too, giving way to stretches of bare rock.

Isaac stopped again, pointing ahead. “Do you see it?”

Hanson squinted. At first, he saw nothing but shadow at the base of the cliff. Then the shadow shifted — not from the sun, but from perspective.

It wasn’t a shadow.

It was an opening.

A black mouth gaping in the stone, tall enough for three men to stand on each other’s shoulders. The edges were unnaturally smooth, as though cut with purpose.

The sight rooted Hanson where he stood.

“…That’s not natural,” he whispered.

Isaac turned to him, triumphant. “Now do you believe me?”

Hanson licked dry lips, his throat tight. “I believe this is how people end up on missing posters.”

But his words lacked their usual bite. The humor was gone.

Because no matter how badly he wanted to dismiss it, to call it fake, to laugh it off — he couldn’t.

Isaac stepped closer, peering into the dark. The air wafting out of it was colder than the mountain air, tinged with something mineral, something old.

Hanson shivered. For the first time since this started, he wondered if Isaac wasn’t the only one in danger.

Maybe *they both were.*

**Part Four**

The mouth of the tunnel gaped before them, swallowing daylight. Isaac stood close, his face gleamed with sweat, his lips twitching with a half-smile.

Hanson hung back, arms crossed tight. “You’re not serious.”

Isaac didn’t turn. “I’m going in.”

“Like hell you are.”

“I came here to find them, Hanson. I didn’t invite you along for sightseeing.”

“You didn’t invite me anywhere,” Hanson snapped. “You kidnapped me. You locked me in my own car and drove me three states over. You’re lucky I haven’t bolted the second we stopped.”

Isaac finally looked at him, his eyes bloodshot but steady. “Then why haven’t you?”

Hanson opened his mouth, then shut it. He hated the answer that bubbled up. Because despite everything — the insanity, the fear, the obsession — a small part of him *did* want to know what was in there.

He rubbed his face hard. “Goddammit!”

Isaac turned back to the cave. “Bring your light.”

The first steps inside were like stepping into another world.

The air shifted instantly: colder, denser, with a faint metallic tang that clung to the tongue. Their flashlights threw narrow beams across jagged stone, catching veins of quartz that glittered like eyes in the dark.

Hanson’s voice echoed unnaturally, too loud in the confined space. “Smells like rust.”

Isaac sniffed. “Iron.”

“Or blood,” Hanson muttered.

The tunnel sloped downward, the ground uneven beneath their boots. After fifty yards, the daylight behind them was a faint, fragile glow. Then it was gone entirely.

The darkness here wasn’t just absence of light. It was a living thing, pressing close around them, suffocating in its weight.

After an hour of careful descent, Hanson spotted something in the beam of his flashlight.

“Hold up.”

Isaac turned. Hanson crouched near the wall, brushing away layers of grime. Something metallic gleamed.

It was a pickaxe, half-buried in the stone. Rusted, ancient. Its handle had long rotted away, but the head was wedged deep, as though abandoned mid-swing.

“Mining equipment,” Hanson said calmly. “That’s all. Just an old shaft. Explains everything.”

Isaac’s expression was unreadable. “Then why didn’t they finish?”

Hanson straightened. “Cave-in. Collapse. Take your pick.”

But he didn’t believe it. Not fully.

Because the pickaxe wasn’t just rusted. The metal looked warped, as though it had been bent by enormous force.

Like someone had grabbed it and crushed it in their fist.

The tunnel widened into a cavern. Their lights swept across towering columns of stone, stalactites like jagged teeth above them. Pools of still water mirrored their beams, rippling with every step.

Isaac moved slowly, reverently. “This is it.”

Hanson’s voice was low. “This is a goddamn tomb.”

They walked deeper. Their footsteps echoed strangely, sometimes sharp, sometimes muffled, as if the sound was being swallowed.

Then Hanson froze.

“Isaac.”

He was pointing at the ground.

In the dust lay bones.

Not animal bones — at least, not like any Hanson recognized. Fragments of enormous femurs, splintered ribs the size of fence posts, a jawbone half-buried in silt, its teeth flat and massive.

Hanson felt his stomach drop. “No…”

Isaac knelt, trembling fingers brushing the jaw. His breath came quick, ragged. “Do you see it now? Do you *see*?”

Hanson backed up. “This isn’t… this can’t—”

But the words died in his throat. Because the bones weren’t old and fossilized like museum pieces. They were pale. Fresh enough to still carry a faint smell of rot.

Something massive had died here — and not long ago.

Just then a sound came.

A low rumble, deep and resonant, vibrating the stone beneath their feet. It wasn’t like the distant groaning Hanson had heard the night before. This was closer.

It was a breath.

Slow. Inhale. Exhale.

Somewhere in the darkness, deeper in the cavern, something was breathing.

Isaac’s face lit up in rapture. “They’re here.”

Hanson’s knees went weak. “We need to leave. *Now.*”

But Isaac only stepped forward, into the dark.

Hanson scrambled after him, whispering harshly. “You’re out of your fucking mind! You don’t know what’s in here—”

Isaac stopped. Slowly, he raised a finger to his lips.

Hanson fell silent.

The air shifted.

From the far side of the cavern, something *moved.* A colossal shadow sliding against stone. The sound of rock grinding under weight. The faint splash of water disturbed.

Then — a voice.

It wasn’t speech, not exactly. It was a vibration, deep enough to make Hanson’s ribs ache. A murmur that resonated more in bone than ear, like language from before language.

Isaac whispered back, too quietly for Hanson to hear.

Hanson’s blood ran cold. “Who the hell are you talking to?”

Isaac didn’t answer.

Quick reminder — today’s the LAST DAY to grab a free copy of my wife’s debut novel, The Cursed One!

It’s been amazing to see how much love this book has already received. She spent over a year pouring her heart into it — countless late nights, rewrites, and coffee-fueled edits — and now it’s out there in the world!

This is the first in a planned fantasy romance series, and she’s already hard at work on Book 2.

Even though fantasy romance isn’t usually my genre, I have to say (not just because I’m biased!) that she found an awesome balance between heartfelt character moments and immersive fantasy worldbuilding. It’s fast-paced, emotional, and surprisingly addictive.

Blurb:

> As shadows gather beyond the Wall and prophecy tightens its grip, Lyrianna and Arès must choose what matters most: duty, vengeance, or the dangerous bond growing between them.

Lyrianna never believed she was meant for more than her curse—until the Trial of Powers awakened the magic she tried to bury for so long. Thrust into the ranks of the Chosen, she must face a destiny she doesn’t want and truths she’s not ready to accept.

Arès has spent his life becoming the weapon everyone demanded of him. Bound by a destiny of his own making, he despises the girl he blames for his family’s death—the girl who has lived in hiding… until now.

Brass Tacks:  
Room w/ private bath, & 2 closets in a 2-bed/2-bath, 1,089 sq ft. apartment. Amenities: Pool w/ waterfall & BBQ grills, small gym, covered parking, small patio, gated complex in a quiet, safe neighborhood near Radio Coffee and In-N-Out Burger.  
  
There are two rooms of slightly different sizes, for a price difference of $75. Whoever moves in can discuss with Ariel, the current tenant, about who gets what room.  
  
\* Lease Terms: 6 months: 11/1/25 - 4/30/26 (w/ the option to renew)  
\* Rent: Smaller room - $860 / Larger room - $935  
\* Utilities: \~$150/person  
\* Security Deposit: $200  
\* Pets: room for 1 more 60lbs or less, so long as they get along with the current Cat/Queen of the house: Riley (a sweet fluffy ball of cuteness) 🐱  
  
Other perks:  
\* Garbage disposal  
\* washer & dryer hook-ups  
\* The complex staff is surprisingly personable & responsive.  
  
The location seems to be one of Austin’s favorite neighborhoods; walking distance to Radio Coffee, 3 different grocery stores, Target, Torchy’s, Broken Spoke, Kerbey Lane Cafe, etc. Barton Springs and downtown are a bike ride away. East Cesar Chavez is a 15 min drive during rush hour.  
  
You’d be sharing the space with Ariel: 39 F, LGBT+, clean, quiet, and spends most of her time at work or in her room watching TV at a barely perceptible level. Since she tends to keep to herself, you'll have the common areas to yourself for the most part.

Quick reminder — today’s the LAST DAY to grab a free copy of my wife’s debut novel, The Cursed One!

It’s been amazing to see how much love this book has already received. She spent over a year pouring her heart into it — countless late nights, rewrites, and coffee-fueled edits — and now it’s out there in the world!

This is the first in a planned fantasy romance series, and she’s already hard at work on Book 2.

Even though fantasy romance isn’t usually my genre, I have to say (not just because I’m biased!) that she found an awesome balance between heartfelt character moments and immersive fantasy worldbuilding. It’s fast-paced, emotional, and surprisingly addictive.

Blurb:

> As shadows gather beyond the Wall and prophecy tightens its grip, Lyrianna and Arès must choose what matters most: duty, vengeance, or the dangerous bond growing between them.

Lyrianna never believed she was meant for more than her curse—until the Trial of Powers awakened the magic she tried to bury for so long. Thrust into the ranks of the Chosen, she must face a destiny she doesn’t want and truths she’s not ready to accept.

Arès has spent his life becoming the weapon everyone demanded of him. Bound by a destiny of his own making, he despises the girl he blames for his family’s death—the girl who has lived in hiding… until now.



It’s free on Kindle Unlimited and free to download on Amazon until tonight:

Oh wow, today was the best Friday ever! The Halloween vibes are starting everywhere — decorations, spooky songs, even the cafeteria had pumpkin cupcakes! And after school, Winfrey surprised us with tickets to a movie night at the cinema downtown.

“The title sounds a bit creepy,” Penny said as we walked in.

> Victor Martinez and the Midnight Illusion — the poster showed a man with glowing blue eyes holding a swirling orb, and beside him, a beautiful magician’s assistant in a black-and-white outfit.
The tagline said:
“When the night awakens, the magic begins.”



Carmen nudged me. “Amy, that’s your kind of movie — mysterious but cool.”
And she was right.

We got popcorn (extra caramel, of course), and the lights dimmed.
The movie started with thunder and eerie music. Victor Martinez appeared, standing in a dark alley, performing a trick that turned sparks into butterflies. Everyone gasped when his eyes glowed — just like on the poster. Then came his assistant, Maria Kurtz — elegant, confident, and a little mischievous. Together, they traveled through illusions, mirrors, and even dreams during a Halloween night full of magic and danger.

Winfrey whispered, “If I were Maria, I’d be too scared to follow him into that dark tunnel!”
I giggled. “Yeah, but she’s so brave — and stylish!”

The final scene showed Victor trapping an evil spirit inside a glowing pendant, saving Maria just before sunrise. The crowd clapped when the credits rolled — even I clapped too long, I think.

Outside the cinema, everyone was buzzing.
Penny said, “That magician gives me chills, but in a good way.”
Carmen added, “If Zoe ever made a Coffee Day Halloween special, it should look exactly like that!”

Winfrey smiled. “Happy almost-Halloween, girls.”

We walked home under the streetlights, passing shop windows full of pumpkins and costumes. I kept thinking about the pendant from the movie — glowing softly in Victor’s hand. It reminded me of the gemstone stories from Bikini Rangers that we used to watch together.

When I got home, Mom was waiting with hot cocoa.
She asked, “How was the movie?”
I told her everything, and she laughed. “Maybe next Halloween, you’ll do a magic show instead of a smoothie one.”
“Maybe,” I said, smiling. “But only if you’re my assistant.”

Tonight, I’m still thinking about the movie. It wasn’t just spooky — it was beautiful.
And now I can’t wait for next week’s Halloween Smoothie Charity Day!
Sunnyville is going to shine like magic.

It begins with 45, 63, 72, 56, and 54 arguing at the rectangle retreat. 45 and 63 say that they should stay in Super rectangle club but 72, 56, and 54 said that they should be kicked out.

1ofinmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/1ofinmp/blackout_experience/,Blackout experience?,"On mobile, sorry if there are any formatting issues! 

So I’m not diagnosed, but my psychologist and psychiatrist have recommended that I start seeing someone who specializes in dissociative disorders because most of my symptoms align with the criteria for DID (or maybe OSDD, I’m not sure.) I’ve been nervous about reaching out to the ppl they referred because I don’t experience that much amnesia, or I thought I didn’t. I’ve been worried that I won’t be taken seriously or that I’m just making all of this up and being overly dramatic. But the more I’ve remembered, the more I realized that the majority of my childhood is just a blank abyss and I can only remember snapshots of it when certain alters(?) are fronting. 

Today I recalled an experience (or few) from childhood that I can’t really place. Is this the sign of a “blackout” switch? I thought I’d never experienced that before but now I’m not so sure. 

I must’ve been 9 or 10 or so, and I woke up really confused. The last thing I could remember was fighting with my mom (my primary abuser) and then being sent to my room. I laid down for an afternoon nap bc I was tired after crying my eyes out, then woke up the next morning at like 7am. 

It was like I closed my eyes one day and just opened them the next. I was really disoriented and honestly just baffled because I woke up wearing my pyjamas, but I’d been wearing jeans and a t-shirt the day before. I wandered into the kitchen to find my nana in her bathrobe sipping on coffee and reading the morning paper. I didn’t know what to make of that, so I asked her, “did we have dinner last night?” thinking she’d tell me yes, and that they let me sleep through it. She looked at me funny and said, “of course we did,” but didn’t elaborate, which only confused me more. I thought for sure she’d comment on me sleeping for so long and skipping dinner but she never did, she just went back to reading her paper. I was really freaked out because I couldn’t tell if they’d abandoned me for the night or if I’d just forgotten an entire evening. I just sorta pushed my fear down and made myself breakfast, and that was that. I never figured out what happened. 

Looking back, I think I “woke up confused” a few times as a kid. Not super often, and I haven’t experienced it as an adult I don’t think, but I didn’t remember those incidents used to occur until today. Is that what people mean by blackouts? Even now I have no recollection of having dinner and going to bed. I just remember the intensely disturbed feeling of having no idea what happened the evening before or how I ended up waking up the next day in pyjamas. I told myself I must’ve changed while sleep walking and slept well over 15 hours, but now I’m questioning if maybe that wasn’t the case. 

Can anyone share what their blackouts are like? Are they similar to just “waking up confused” like that? ",2,1761367155.0,DID,3,1.0,False

Here’s the Brutal Truth About Shipping....,"We all love building. It’s in our blood. Late nights, coffee-fueled sessions, that rush when your idea finally comes alive.

But here’s the thing: building is the easy part. Shipping? Marketing? That’s the nightmare nobody warns you about.

Some of us never finish. Some get distracted by the next shiny idea. And then there are the rest of us… we actually ship. We create an X account, post on subreddits, tweet links, hoping someone notices… only to get a handful of clicks, a few downvotes, or nothing at all. I know because I’ve lived it.

Six months ago, I built JustGrind, an AI habit coach. Coding it was fun (countless nights debugging, still loving it). Shipping it? Pure hell. Marketing it? Even worse.

💥 Hard truth: your product could literally solve someone’s biggest problem… cure cancer even… but if nobody knows it exists, it’s worthless.

I struggled. I got discouraged. I kept avoiding shipping because I was scared of failure — afraid six months of work wouldn’t get the attention it deserved. Even after I shipped it, the traction I hoped for didn’t come. It felt like all that work vanished into a void. That’s when I thought: what if I could solve this problem the same way I solve others, with a tool?

So I built **Postnix AI** — it helps indie hackers, creators, and solo founders finally get their hard work seen. Postnix analyzes top-performing posts in your target subreddits and helps you craft posts that actually get noticed — no spam, no guesswork.

🚀 **What I’ve learned along the way:**

* No matter how much time you pour into coding or sleepless nights you grind through, a product nobody sees never truly exists.
* Motivation is temporary. Systems and consistency are forever.
* Fear before launch never goes away. You just have to take the leap.
* Building is fun. Marketing is hell. But if you don’t ship, none of it matters.
* The struggle you feel? Everyone’s been there. And that’s okay — it’s part of the journey.

It’s still early days for Postnix, but seeing creators actually get traction from it… that’s worth every “why am I doing this” night.",1,1761367087.0,indiehackers,1,0.56,False
1ofimkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaMarzocco/comments/1ofimkb/what_am_i_missing_about_the_mini/,What am I missing about the mini?,"I think I’m going to buy a La Marzocco Linea Mini R and see what happens. Am I crazy? Perhaps. 

I started drinking coffee about 18 months ago. As a household we are spending about $400 a month on coffee at the local cafe. 

I’m not really looking to go on a coffee journey. I want exceptional build quality and decent coffee with minimal effort (but not ‘no effort’, I feel like things like the Breville Oracle cheapens the experience at great expense)… somewhere between a moka pot and operating a steam engine is fine.

One of the common criticisms I see made about the Micra and Mini is the lack of pressure profiling for the price… I don’t know what that is exactly, and I think I’m ok with that. 

Here’s what I like about the mini: build quality, consistency, design. We have previously had our fridge plumbed in to mains so I’m hoping it will be easy to plumb in the mini by using the same connection.

A few times a year it would be nice to be able to pump out about 10 coffees for guests. Generally I would probably make 2-3 throughout the day and my wife would usually make one in the morning before work.

Obviously these machines are expensive, putting the cost aside, am I on the right track here? I feel like I’m the target market for a machine like this. If you disagree, what would you suggest instead?

I’m expecting a few additional costs to factor in, a water filter, yearly servicing, beans (obviously) and eventually an automatic grinder… I have a Comandante C40 MK4 Nitro Blade Coffee Grinder so I was just going to use that to start with.

Thanks in advance for your insights.

All the best.

I 34F met a guy 33M on an online dating app I’m going to call him G for this post, I had lots of matches and likes but for some reason he stood out above the rest. When we started talking it was so comfortable it’s so hard to explain we talked on the app for about 2 weeks then exchanged numbers and continued talking from there. He was never creepy or asking for/sending “the pics” we just talked about our days and things we got up to, talked about our family’s and such it honestly felt like we’d known each other for years I know that sounds like such a cliche but it really did. After about 2 months of talking we met up for coffee we live about 2 and a half hours apart from each other so we met at a half way point. We had coffee and sat for hours just talking I mean 4 hours after we were supposed to leave we just kept talking and didn’t realise the time. Went home and continued to talk as normal. Met up again about 1 month later and we spent the night together everything just happened naturally it was really nice. Spent a few more nights together and by this stage I knew I more than just liked him, but I didn’t know where his feelings stood so I said nothing just waited. One day he text and said he was gonna ring shortly if I had time to talk, so when he rang he sounded kinda nervous and asked me where do I see this going ? what do I want from this long term ? I figured bite the bullet and just tell him that I would like to make something official with us. He immediately relaxed and said he was hoping that’s what I would say and had wanted to ask me for a few weeks before but was too nervous. Nothing really changed with us after making it official we continued the same routine and everything was great. The line of work he is in is very time consuming (believe me I’m in the same) during certain seasons he can be up at 5.30am and maybe not home until 1 or 2 am and not always able to reply for a few hours (which never bothered me or worried me) again I’m in the same or similar work so I know how it goes, so then maybe 3 weeks ago he text me saying he doesn’t know if this is what he wants he’s not sure and maybe we should just be friends for the time being ….I’m not to proud to admit it but this completely took me by surprise and sent me spiralling a bit/lot but I’m very good at burying feelings or at the very least keeping them contained within myself. We still continued to talk as normal and have met up a few times since this ..and before anyone says he’s keeping me on a long line as a back up or safety net I can’t honestly tell you when we are in each others company he is never trying to “just get with me” if anything I’m probably the one that starts things… we honestly go on exactly like we did before just with “no title” ?? Another part of this story that I hate for reasons that should be long out dated but I also think has a lot to do with it is we come from different religious backgrounds … and the parts of the county’s  we are both from still hold a bit of a stigma against mixing together but he knows what I am and I know what he is and it has never been a problem for either of us alone …but our extended families may be different !! in my case I couldn’t care less if my family have a problem with it. But I know for him that his father is VERY deep in his faith… G is the only male child in his family so stands to take over the “empire” as it would be classed I suppose …and that makes things so much harder for him to be scrutinised for something so old age and in my opinion outdated …but here we are  the funniest thing (well maybe not funny) is that I myself am half and half my father was one religion (the same as G) and my mother another I was just raised in my mothers religion as the church dictates it should be for a mixed religion marriage. Okay so maybe I’m going a bit off topic now sorry…. So I guess overall my question is has anyone been through this and seen the light at the end of the tunnel? I’ve honestly been in relationships before that have never felt even close to how I’m feeling about myself and G we just seem to “click” and get on so well we have so much in common we never run out of things to talk about no stagnant “hi” or “what are you doing” conversations everything just flows so naturally from the last message or call we had. Please I’m asking for brutal honesty here will it ever work if it is down to such outdated views ?? FYI in case it’s not obvious and I wasn’t sure whether to actually say it or not …. I have been brought up Catholic (not exactly practicing) and G has been brought up Presbyterian (not sure if he’s practices) ….sorry this has been so long winded",1,1761366999.0,relationships_advice,1,1.0,False

Garnishes can be sweet, savoury, or primarily decorative. To most laypeople, when you say “cocktail”, you evoke images of Tiki drinks piled high with pineapple slices and maraschino cherries. A [citrus peel](https://www.moodymixologist.com/blog/guide-to-citrus-peel-cocktail-garnishes), while not eaten itself, releases aromatic oils which enhance the flavour of some drinks. The bartender’s dreaded espresso martini often comes dotted with two or three coffee beans, with while the olive martini is such a classic it’s even earned itself its very own emoji.🍸

In modern times, garnishes have been known to overtake the drink itself: some bars serve their Bloody Mary with a veritable side salad or even [an entire slider](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cheeseburger-bloody-mary_n_2285667) tacked on top. You don’t have to go that far. In fact you probably shouldn’t. But whether your garnish is a snack, a flavour enhancer, or merely something to pick off and set on your napkin before you actually drink, I cannot wait for this sub to be garnished with your fine submissions.

It’s not like the money is huge, but it stacks up. And I feel like a debt collector sending pings like, “Hey, did you forget?” They’ll reply, “Oh right, I’ll send it tonight,” and then… radio silence.

Now I’m stuck: do I keep reminding them (but risk looking like their personal accountant), or do I just stop picking up anything for them and let them deal with it themselves?

A: Keep reminding. It’s their debt, you’re not wrong to chase it down.  
B: Stop covering for them. Next time they ask, just say you can’t.

1ofihdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ofihdi/aita_sister_married_an_abuser/,AITA- sister married an abuser,"Sisters: Female (37) -  younger sister (29) married a male abuser (21). 
Hi! so my sister got married this year to a 21 year old child. For over a year we tried to graciously speak wisdom to her and she vehemently rejected us. However, we did not stop and we used every tool we had to help her understand our perspective but she rebelled. Throughout this process we continued to pray but the more we did, the further away she went and found refuge in his family. The pleading from the family went on for a year, even the week prior we tried to talk her out of it. But alas, his family, her new family had convinced her that their son was her soulmate. They convinced her that they would be there for her no matter what. That they are doing the right thing. Nonetheless, they succeeded in convincing her to move away to another state with them; a move that would happen immediately after the wedding. 

my sister, the girl who I admired for years and truly loved, had lost herself. The change was drastic and toxic- the child she was involved with didn’t add to her life, but instead she changed and behaved as if she was younger than him. So imagine, 21 year old child with a 29 year old who believed she was his age. 
My sister married this child, moved to a different state and within 3 months, her “soulmate” puts his hands on her. Her soulmate throws coffee on her because she turned a light on, breaks everything that she owns - specifically the items he didn’t purchase and lastly pepper sprayed her. That’s right, pepper sprayed. 

Note: his parents are pastors now in the new state and they are the ones giving my sister and the child “counseling”. The child vents and seeks refuge from his parents and tells them everything that my sister is doing wrong.  And of course, you guessed it, they side with him. To the point that it is evident that he treks them things because his mom slips and brings it up. So yes, they are not innocent and I need to save my sister. 

So now, would I be the AH if I confront him during thanksgiving (2025) and tell him that he has 30 days to file for divorce, if he doesn’t, he will force my hand. 
Within a few goggle searches I found information. 
What I know: 
1. The mother is a realtor and I know who she works for. 
2. The father has a painting company.
3. Lastly, I know the value of having a good reputation in the church community - I personally know a lot of the people that they know. 

So am I the AH if I use the information that I have against the child and his family? Or is there another way to invoke fear, ideas?

**Initial Reading:** For receiving one confessional, Sophi's edit continues to shine in the exact way previous winners' edits have in cool down episodes. Every sentence she spoke except for her answer at Tribal Council was scored at least in one category this episode. I remain confident in my winner pick. 

**1. Sophi--95 points**

**Positive Scenes:** 

* E5 C1 ""but luckily I've worked pretty hard in the last couple of days to salvage relationships that will probably keep me safe tonight"" We see shot of Nate saying ""Sophi's with us"" and she stays
* E5 tells Jawan she doesn't want Jason to play SITD. He doesn't
* E5 Rizo tells Nate ""But it's fine. Sophi is with us""
* E5 Jawan C1 ""but like right now on this current tribe, we are a solid five,""
* E5 Steven tells Alex Shannon wants an alliance of Alex, Steven, Kristina, and Sophi. ""Sophi"" was subtitled
* E5 her boyfriend works three days a week
* E5 watches Muckbangs on social media
* E5 C1 ""because all I want to do is play as hard as I can""

**Negative Scenes:** None Scored

**Overall Impression:** Every sentence Sophi spoke this episode was scored in at least one Oracle category, other than her response at Tribal Council, which was still a poignant and potentially foreshadowing comment that also tied back to her response in E2 about how you can't change the winds but you can adjust your sails. There are not a ton of examples, but so far in the new era, every player who has gotten double digit Oracle scores from a one confessional episode has gone on to win. Sophi continues to run away with this season in terms of matching the categories of content previous winners have gotten. Perhaps my one quibble is she no longer leads confessional validation sequences. 

**2. Nate--41 points**

**Positive Scenes:** 

* E5 C2 ""I see MC, and we immediately exchange pleasantries and give each other a big hug, but it's a little bit like two boxers sizing each other up. We are on the opposite sides of what could be construed as a Hina-Uli conflict"" Then MC C2 says ""Matt going home was 100% the first shot at the OG Hina tribe, so now lines are drawn""
* E5 C3 ""I knew that I couldn't keep up, but I did want to use this as a bonding moment, so in giving MC a fun fact what I'm trying to do is make myself a person and not a target"" Then MC C3 ""I love that he's trying to get to know me, but I can't breathe, so... But I do enjoy getting to know Nate, and I think that will be important 'cause that merge is coming""
* E5 C5 ""I know that advantages come with having targets on your back, but I certainly don't want MC to have it either. I realize I'm not gonna find it, and I know that the longer she's out there the better her odds are of finding it. There's a lot of sand left in that timer, but I want this to be over"" Then MC C5 says ""When Nate calls me back, I look at the hourglass timer. Looks like there's still a good amount of time to search, so I'm thinking, ""Does Nate have some ulterior motive?"" It's hard to tell, but my brain is not working, so let's just end this right here""
* E5 C5 ""So I pitch to MC, ""We finish almost all of this challenge and whatever time left, we can go look for the advantage. That way, we're both guaranteed to have our vote."" "" She does this
* E5 Jawan C1 ""but like right now on this current tribe, we are a solid five,""
* E5 grew up in the 80's without phones and social media
* E5 is father of 2
* E5 used to have lip pierced

**Negative Scenes:** None scored

* I did not score Nate for driving the Jawan decoy. I thought about it, but I believe C6 is too equivocal and hypothetical to count. It is different from Savannah's, where she tells us she wants to vote out Jawan, even if she's unsure if she will do so. He did not say he wants to. He was just considering a hypothetical. 

**Overall Impression:** Nate had a very strong episode, but he also got a lot of content. He now trails Sophi in score per confessional, meaning, if he were the winner, I would have expected even more this episode from him. He scored -1 in episode 3, and all winners have had only one negative scoring episode in the new era (Dee 45, when she voted for Sifu episode 4). Overall, I like Nate's edit, but it's not in the same category as Sophi's. 

**3. Alex--38** 

**Positive Scenes:** 

* E5 when Steven asks Kristina who she gets good vibes from, she says Shannon and Alex

**Negative Scenes:** None scored

**Overall Impression:** Alex stands in contrast to Sophi. Neither got a ton of content. Alex actually got more confessionals, but one was about his personal life. As I have discussed prior, personal content confessionals do not correlate with winning the game. Winners get them at the same clip as non-winners. They are character building techniques, not drivers of the winning narrative. Whereas Sophi scored 11 points with 1 confessional, Alex scored 1 point with 2 confessionals. The edit is very intentional about quiet episodes from winners, including little things like Sophi saying she hopes Jason doesn't play the SITD, or giving personal content outside of confessional. Alex is not getting winner trends in quiet episodes, even if he is getting them in louder episodes. He has great story consistency, and his edit is much better than I expected after the first episode, but it is not as strong as Sophi's. As one obvious tell, if Alex had won, I would have expected the edit to let him talk first about the chickens. Steven got two confessional validation sequences out of that scene. It would have been very easy to include Alex's confessional first, as Rachel got in S47 about the same topic. I know TEOS loves that scene for Alex. I do not, because personal content in confessional is irrelevant to the winner's ultimate edit. 

**4. Savannah-30 points**

**Positive**

* E5 C5 ""They're going to worry that we are starting this war, and that's not what I want because ultimately I think we do have to work with the former Hina tribe in order to make it far and to the end of this game. So in talking to Jason, I want him to feel like I actually am willing to work with him because honestly I am willing to work with him"" Then Jason C4 says ""What Savannah made me realize is that I am the sole thread that connects nuHina with old Hina. My position is key to everyone moving forward in this game. The ball's in Savannah's court""
* E5 C6 ""The good news is that Nate's very open to working with Jason, which is perfect because I didn't want to choose this moment to take control. I'd rather have Nate make the decision on this"" Then Nate C7 says ""The easy vote tonight is Jason, but the other question mark is Jawan, who since Day 1 on Uli beach we all wondered how loyal he could be. If we took out Jawan tonight and kept Jason, it might say, ""Hey, this game is wide open. We don't have to vote on tribal lines anymore.""""
* E5 predicts the boat is for a journey, and she is right
* E5 tells Jawan he has to make Jason feel comfortable. Jason then tells Jawan on beach ""I really like you Jawan. I'm for real about it."" 
* E5 C1 ""My alliance is solid. We are in the majority big time here on this beach, and we got to get rid of one of the old Hina. I have nothing to worry about. "" (Boot credit for Matt)
* E5 C1 ""? So if we end up going to another Tribal Council, from my point of view, Jason's gotta go""
* E5 Jawan C1 ""but like right now on this current tribe, we are a solid five,""
* E5 C5 ""ultimately I think we do have to work with the former Hina tribe in order to make it far and to the end of this game.""

**Negative Scenes:** 

* E5 C2 ""over at the old Uli camp Jawan was using my clean bag with my clean clothes to collect firewood aka look for Idols"" He was not looking for idols and was in fact collecting firewood
* E5 C4 ""Jason might be the easy vote right now, but I've said literally since Day 2, ""Jawan is extremely hard to work with."" I'm ready to see that guy go home ""
* E5 C5 ""On paper Jason is the obvious vote tonight. It would be numbers, former Uli versus Hina. I am seriously considering writing Jawan's name down because if we get rid of Jason I fear that the former Hina are gonna think that we are targeting their whole tribe""
* E5 C6 ""The good news is that Nate's very open to working with Jason, which is perfect because I didn't want to choose this moment to take control. I'd rather have Nate make the decision on this""
* E5 tells Rizo she wants Jawan gone. This is before her confessional. 
* E5 C1 ""My alliance is solid. We are in the majority big time here on this beach, and we got to get rid of one of the old Hina. I have nothing to worry about. "" (arrogance)

**Overall Impression:** Savannah is getting a lot of content. It's just not the type of content winners have received in the past. She has not given us a personal fact outside of confessional since episode 1. She's been hit 3 times now for arrogance. I have not noticed any irrelevant non-confessional validation, such as Sophi saying Jason better not play his SITD or there's never been a snake bite on Survivor before. These are the little tidbits that my research shows winners should be getting. I think, like Alex, Savannah has a great, consistent story. She's driving the narrative this season. Perhaps Oracle is wrong and she will win. But based on my modeling, she doesn't appear to be winning right now. 

**5. Steven--22 points**

**Positive Scenes:** 

* E5 C3 ""winning chickens as a reward feels like an anti-reward. It is, like, ""Congratulations for winning, here's some farm chores. Not to turn my nose up to the first real proteins since we've been here, but I have never killed anything in my entire life, and I just know that Alex and I are the only two that could probably stomach the process"" Then Sage C6 says ""I had pet chickens growing up, but I'm not a vegetarian, so it's easy to sit on your couch in the comfort of your home with food on your lap and say what you would or wouldn't do, but come out here if you really want to test that""
* E5 C3 ""winning chickens as a reward feels like an anti-reward. It is, like, ""Congratulations for winning, here's some farm chores. Not to turn my nose up to the first real proteins since we've been here, but I have never killed anything in my entire life, and I just know that Alex and I are the only two that could probably stomach the process"" Then Alex C2 says ""I'm used to living a very comfortable life. I live in my highrise apartment building and order doordash and just don't think twice. For my whole life, I've honestly been made fun of because people think I'm weak. They think that I'm not tough enough. They think that I'm not strong enough. They say I'm too feminine. So all those people who've made comments about how soft I am, ""Are you guys killing chickens on Survivor? I don't think so.""""
* E5 C2 ""Thankfully, the Hina tribe agreed that MC would be the one to go. She's my #1. She's gonna tell me everything"" She does tell the whole story, unlike Nate.
* E5 tells MC he feels like Shannon would say she gets good vibes to everyone, and we have already seen this. 
* E5 roommate's dog killed a rat once

**Negative Scenes:** 

* E5 Savannah C1 ""You know who started the war was the old Hina tribe every time they did that stupid ""Hina, Hina"" chant""

**Overall Impression:** Steven's edit continues to be decidedly better than the rest of the Hina, while decidedly worse than the top contenders. Who knows why? One project I may take on soon is analyzing the categories to see if there's a pattern beyond just being correlated with the winner. Perhaps certain scenes correlate with winning, but also correlate with being a last boot, or something. Until I do that, all I know is Steven doesn't have enough legs to win, even with a fantastic post merge. 

**6. Sage--15 points**

**Positive Scenes:** 

* E5 C1 ""I see Shannon pulling the ol' Parvati with Alex. She's kissing his hand. She's holding him... Everybody else sees the seal. I'm trying to be, like, ""Guys, it's a freaking shark. Do you see that fin on the back? Like it's so obvious."""" Then Alex C1 says ""The first person who started talking strategy with me was Shannon, and honestly, it was very appreciated. And as the only original Kele member on the new Kele tribe, if someone wants to talk strategy with me, I'm completely open. I trusted Shannon and was willing to work with her, but the fact that Steven is cluing me in to Shannon talking to everyone is a really bad sign""
* E5 C3 ""when Shannon was off doing something, it was just me and the other five. Now's the time to strike. If you're looking at the numbers here, it's former Hina strong, and I'm really hoping to work with former Hina, so I want to use this opportunity to continue building that rapport and trust, so they'll take me further in the game"" Then MC C6 says ""Sage tells us that Rizo found the Beware Advantage on the Uli camp. The task is similar to the task that I have for my own Beware Advantage, so I know this girl is telling the truth. This definitely tips the scale towards Sage when it comes to if we need to vote someone off. ""
* E5 C4 ""In terms of where Shannon and I stand, I still feel there's a part of her that sees me as this wounded puppy that just needs encouragement and needs reassurance so that I won't suspect anything, and I won't play my shot in the dark"" Shannon C3 has said ""If we do lose, it might be obvious to Sage that it's either me or her, but when it comes to Sage, it seems like she's really just not talking strategy with anybody""
* **Last Word Confessional:** E5 C5 ""I can tell when somebody thinks I'm stupid, but the reality is I'm a wolf, baby. I'm ready to eat her, and I think I'm getting that opportunity"" Shannon C4 has said ""My relationship with Sage doesn't feel that different from Uli. It's a lot of fun conversations. You know, it can be about pooping or pimples or how she was the Easter Bunny. All I know is that when I talk to her, it's not super strategic"" As a reminder, nearly 50% of last word confessionals have been from winners (when one player gives negative SPV, and then that player gets the last confessional of the episode segment). I do not think Sage is winning, but if you wanted an argument, this is the best one you have. 
* E5 C1 ""Like I see Shannon doing her thing. Shannon very much has an approach of finding something you value and then going hard into that thing in every conversation with you"" Shannon is shown doing this
* E5 MC C6 "". I'd rather keep Sage than Shannon, and it sounds like Sage wants to truly work with us, so I wanna work with her""

**Negative Scenes:**

* E5 C5 ""I can tell when somebody thinks I'm stupid, but the reality is I'm a wolf, baby. I'm ready to eat her, and I think I'm getting that opportunity"" (Violence)

**Overall Impression:** Pimple girl is the comeback kid y'all! It was a truly great edit for Sage, who has now passed Shannon in the rankings, which I never saw coming. Sage is also one of just four players left to not receive a negative scoring episode so far, with Sophi, Savannah, and Alex. 

**7. Shannon--12 points**

**Positive Scenes:** 

* E5 MC C1 ""Shannon, it seems like she's a good game player. ""
* E5 Kristina C1 ""Emotionally, I really connect with Shannon""
* E5 Alex C1 ""The first person who started talking strategy with me was Shannon, and honestly, it was very appreciated""
* E5 is the oldest of three daughters

**Negative Scenes:** 

* E5 C1 ""What I came up with was this idea of two Uli, two Hina, and two Kele, of course 6, to work together to keep each other's names out of the rotation. Naturally, Steven likes this idea because it's a great idea"" Then Steven C1 says ""Shannon rolls over and starts spitting game at me. I'm, like, ""Dude, I know we don't have coffee, but can I get some coffee before we start doing this?"" Of course I'm gonna say, ""Yes"". You don't say, “No”, to an alliance, but it was just so early, and she's playing so hard""
* E5 C2 ""Right now, I'm doing my best to have conversations and connecting with people in a really authentic way while also doing my best of keep my strategic pants on. I'd definitely say, ""We're making progress!"""" MC C1 says ""Shannon, it seems like she's a good game player. I actually admire it a little bit 'cause it's kind of like how I want to play, but that's not someone I want to have against me in the future""
* E5 C2 ""Right now, I'm doing my best to have conversations and connecting with people in a really authentic way while also doing my best of keep my strategic pants on. I'd definitely say, ""We're making progress!"""" Then Kristina C1 says ""Emotionally, I really connect with Shannon. I do think she's being so genuine with me, and I really like her, but I'm also realizing with talking with my alliance that Shannon is playing the game hard, and people are starting to maybe question it a little bit""
* E5 C3 ""If we do lose, it might be obvious to Sage that it's either me or her, but when it comes to Sage, it seems like she's really just not talking strategy with anybody."" Sage C3 has said ""I'm really hoping to work with former Hina, so I want to use this opportunity to continue building that rapport and trust, so they'll take me further in the game
* E5 C4 ""My relationship with Sage doesn't feel that different from Uli. It's a lot of fun conversations. You know, it can be about pooping or pimples or how she was the Easter Bunny.

I'm ready to eat her, and I think I'm getting that opportunity""
* E5 Sage C1 ""She's laying it on thick and leaning into like whatever she knows is gonna make them feel comfortable and safe and good and sane""
* E5 Steven tells MC his conversation with Shannon sketched him out
* E5 Sage says to the camera after Alex catches a crab, about Shannon, ""Voice gets higher anytime someone else is around. So sloppy""

**Overall Impression:** What a fall from grace. Shannon loses half her point total in one episode. The edit allows winners to be wrong, but as I have said, there are subtle ways they distinguish between winners being wrong and non-winners being wrong. This was the equivalent of Shauhin's episode 4 last season. She was confidently wrong about everything, and the edit laid it on thick. Five confessional contradiction sequences in one episode is....something. There is NO doubt in my mind, if she won, she would have gotten no more than one such sequence. 

**8. MC--8 points**

**Positive Scenes:** 

* E5 C1 ""Shannon, it seems like she's a good game player. I actually admire it a little bit 'cause it's kind of like how I want to play, but that's not someone I want to have against me in the future"" then Kristina C1 says ""Emotionally, I really connect with Shannon. I do think she's being so genuine with me, and I really like her, but I'm also realizing with talking with my alliance that Shannon is playing the game hard, and people are starting to maybe question it a little bit""
* E5 C6 "". I'd rather keep Sage than Shannon, and it sounds like Sage wants to truly work with us, so I wanna work with her"" Sage C3 has said she wants to work with Hina
* E5 C2 ""I already don't have a vote because I haven't finished my Beware Advantage, and now it's like I'm fighting for my vote again, so I cannot leave here without a vote"" She gets her vote back
* E5 Steven C2 ""Thankfully, the Hina tribe agreed that MC would be the one to go. She's my #1. ""
* E5 Nate C3 ""MC sets a pace that is way beyond what I was thinking. She is a beast. I felt like i was trying to chase after the Terminator""
* E5 is Nigerian
* E5 can burp the alphabet

**Negative Scenes:** 

* E5 Savannah C1 ""You know who started the war was the old Hina tribe every time they did that stupid ""Hina, Hina"" chant""
* E5 C5 "". I look back at the sandbags, and I'm, like, ""I just did that. Like I just did that."" That's what I came here to do, to do hard things"" (Journey edit)

**Overall Impression:** This felt like a better episode than it scored for MC. Critically, Nate got all the confessional validation sequences in the journey. She was mostly used to confirm his perspective. 

**9. Rizo--6 points**

**Positive Scenes:**

* Note, Rizo does not get confessional validation sequence for reading that Jawan was pissing off Savannah. I gave to him reading the transcript, but on screen, Savannah tells this to Rizo before he says it in confessional. Thus, it is not a ""read"" but repeating what he was told, which is not a validation sequence. 
* Also does not get boot credit, because confessional right after challenge is equivocal, and it is not clear if he wants to target Jason or not, given the consequences
* E5 C1 ""but if Uli had to have gone to Tribal Council, I think Jawan would have been the one in the hot seat."" Savannah C4 then says ""Jason might be the easy vote right now, but I've said literally since Day 2, ""Jawan is extremely hard to work with."" I'm ready to see that guy go home ""
* E5 challenge predicts chickens. He is right
* E5 Jawan C1 ""but like right now on this current tribe, we are a solid five,""
* E5 doesn't update social media, but girlfriend watches Muckbangs on ticktock

**Negative Scenes:** None scored

**Overall Impression:** I'm grateful he didn't do R-I-Z-G-O-D Rizgod Baby this episode. 

**10. Sophie-- -2 points**

**Positive Scenes:**

* E5 is the oldest of four daughters

**Negative Scenes:** 

* E5 Savannah C1 ""You know who started the war was the old Hina tribe every time they did that stupid ""Hina, Hina"" chant""

**Overall Impression:** She doesn't even go here...

**11. Jawan-- -6 points**

**Positive Scenes:** 

* E5 C2 ""Of course Jason wants to go... To ensure that Jason won't be able to go on the journey, I come up with this plan to basically do rocks. There's 2 black rocks, and only 1 white rock. I put the white rock on top, and I make sure Nate goes first"" Then Nate C1 ""The good thing is Jason's not going on the journey. The bad thing is Nate is going on the journey. ""
* E5 tells Savannah he doesn't want Jason to play SITD. He doesn't
* E5 tribal says he feels like he was on the bottom, which Savannah has already confirmed this episode
* Made Boot: E5 C3 ""By eliminating Jason, Hina is gonna be down two members, and the Uli tribe will still have six, and going into a potential merge, that's a game changer""
* E5 Jason C2 ""I really get along with Jawan, and I think, ""Who's the nerdiest nerd of them all?"" Me and Jawan are kinda neck and neck up there.""
* E5 Rizo C1 ""Back in the OG Uli tribe, I personally felt good with Jawan. We kind of got that brotherly East Coast vibe to us""
* E5 favorite Pokemon is Toto Dial
* E5 tribal is a nervous guy who does better one on one

**Negative Scenes:** 

* E5 C1 ""Jason is in trouble only because he got dealt a bad hand, but I'm not ruling Jason out because if this Uli-Hina war ends, I want to have potential allies moving forward, but like right now on this current tribe, we are a solid five, and with that, unfortunately, leaves my boy, Jason, on the bottom"" Then Savannah C2 says "" I have a little bit of beef with Jawan. He's using my stuff. He's using my bag. He's using my water bottle. It's agitating. Honestly, Jawan was at the bottom. He might still be at the bottom""
* E5 C3 ""By eliminating Jason, Hina is gonna be down two members, and the Uli tribe will still have six, and going into a potential merge, that's a game changer"" Then Savannah C5 says ""On paper Jason is the obvious vote tonight. It would be numbers, former Uli versus Hina. I am seriously considering writing Jawan's name down because if we get rid of Jason I fear that the former Hina are gonna think that we are targeting their whole tribe""
* E5 Savannah C2 ""It's just agitating at this point because over at the old Uli camp Jawan was using my clean bag with my clean clothes to collect firewood aka look for Idols, so yeah, I have a little bit of beef with Jawan. He's using my stuff. He's using my bag. He's using my water bottle. It's agitating. Honestly, Jawan was at the bottom. He might still be at the bottom""
* E5 Savannah C3 ""I don't know if Jawan thinks I'm stupid, but I can tell when he's trying to listen in on my conversations. It's so obvious. That's objectively weird""
* E5 Savannah C4 ""Jason might be the easy vote right now, but I've said literally since Day 2, ""Jawan is extremely hard to work with."" I'm ready to see that guy go home because he's actually making my life out here more stressful. Why would I want to be in an environment of stress with an extra element of stress, aka Jawan""
* E5 Savannah C7 ""I don't really know for sure if I'm going to go vote for Jason or maybe eat one of my own and vote for Jawan. He's been bugging me since Day 2. I think he's a liability. I think he's frantic""

**Overall Impression:** Savannah vs Jawan is the Rorschach Test of the season. Time will tell who is right. 

**12. Kristina-- -12 points**

**Positive Scenes:** 

* E5 C2 ""I'm definitely afraid of birds, but deep down, I want to eat the chickens really bad. We're hungry. This is not fake. Like we are coming in eating 3 crab legs a day, a little bit of coconut, and so for me personally, I would have eaten a chicken as long as someone else did all the work for it."" Then Sophie C1 says ""It's been emotional, but there was never a question in any of our minds that we had to eat that chicken. We just emptied our tanks and then some, and so the idea that we would, like, maybe just eat coconut and snails tonight after that challenge, which like wrung me dry, is crazy. And so to get something like a chicken, that is going to give us a huge advantage over the other tribe""
* E5 Steven tells Alex Shannon wants an alliance of Alex, Steven, Kristina, and Sophi. ""Sophi"" was subtitled

**Negative Scenes:** 

* E5 Savannah C1 ""You know who started the war was the old Hina tribe every time they did that stupid ""Hina, Hina"" chant""

**Overall Impression:** Every season, there's been one player Oracle really hates that I don't understand. Kristina is that player. I like Kristina! She's not winning, but I've enjoyed her time on the show.

**Eliminated: Jason -17 points**

**Positive Scenes:** 

* E5 C1 ""so no matter how much Uli wants to say tribal lines have dissolved, they clearly haven't because the only people that got votes were old Hina, so I have a lot of work to do"" Then Savannah C1 says ""Like how are we expected to work with people who are so tightly bonded? You literally gave us no choice. What else are we supposed to do? So if we end up going to another Tribal Council, from my point of view, Jason's gotta go""
* E5 Jawan C1 ""I'm not ruling Jason out because if this Uli-Hina war ends, I want to have potential allies moving forward, but like right now on this current tribe, we are a solid five, and with that, unfortunately, leaves my boy, Jason, on the bottom""
* E5 favorite pokemon is Jojo (?)
* E5 does not keep his social media up to date

**Negative Scenes:** 

* E5 C2 ""My plan is to erase tribal lines in order to break the us versus them mentality of Hina versus Uli. I wanna start making personal connections to see which ones stick. I really get along with Jawan, and I think, ""Who's the nerdiest nerd of them all?"" Me and Jawan are kinda neck and neck up there"" Then Jawan C1 ""Jason is in trouble only because he got dealt a bad hand, but I'm not ruling Jason out because if this Uli-Hina war ends, I want to have potential allies moving forward, but like right now on this current tribe, we are a solid five, and with that, unfortunately, leaves my boy, Jason, on the bottom""
* E5 C3 ""I feel very clearly on the bottom of this tribe. That boat is potentially my ticket back into a safe spot in this game. If I had any sort of advantage that this boat could bring me, I need it, and I need it now"" Then Jawan C2 ""Of course Jason wants to go. I love Jason, but if he goes on this journey, there's a chance that he could come back with an Idol or an advantage... To ensure that Jason won't be able to go on the journey, I come up with this plan to basically do rocks. There's 2 black rocks, and only 1 white rock. I put the white rock on top, and I make sure Nate goes first""
* E5 tells Jawan to vote Rizo
* E5 Savannah C1 ""You know who started the war was the old Hina tribe every time they did that stupid ""Hina, Hina"" chant""

**Overall Impression:** Nice kid. Bad Survivor player. The Hina chant was probably not a good idea. ",2,1761366280.0,Edgic,3,1.0,False

To be honest i don’t know nothing about japanese people and i don’t even watch anime or anything like that, i just like her because of her personality.

Hey there! I’m a 29-year-old guy new to Louisville, looking for a best friend forever to share laughs, deep talks, and maybe some epic gaming sessions. I’m all about building a real connection—starting online with chats or video calls, and maybe grabbing coffee or hitting a brewery trivia night down the line.

A bit about me: I’m settling into my new apartment (proudly assembled my L-shaped desk solo!), love geeking out over tech (RTX 3090, anyone?), and enjoy low-key hangs like park walks or binge-watching sci-fi. I’m productive but laid-back, always up for a good meme exchange or debating the best stealth game.
Looking for someone around 25-35 who’s kind, open-minded, and ready for a platonic bond that could last years. Bonus points if you’re into gaming, sitcoms, or just vibing over coffee. DM me with your favorite hobby or a fun fact—let’s start this friendship journey! ",0,1761366030.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

Here’s my shift 👇

Old way: send 1,000+ “we help companies like yours” emails → 1–2 weak replies.  
New way: send <800 *researched* emails → 87 positive replies, 45 meetings, 5 retainer clients (6-month deals).

What changed?

I stopped faking personalization (“Congrats on your funding!”) and started *earning* it:

* Spend 5-10 min per contact → find 1 real human detail (post, tweet, job post, etc.).
* Reference it naturally (“That last joke in your post actually made me snort my coffee 😅”).
* Tie your offer *to their world*, not your pitch deck.

That’s it. Manual personalization → genuine interest → compounding trust.  
Once you spot the patterns, you can automate parts *without killing the soul*.

**Research > Reach. Quality > Quantity.**  
That’s how you build a cold email system that actually warms up.
