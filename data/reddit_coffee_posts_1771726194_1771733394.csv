I (34F) recently returned home after being away for several weeks. Upon my return, I discovered that while I was gone, my husband (34M) of several years and my best friend (34F) were spending nearly every single day together.

​This wasn’t just the occasional coffee. They were together after work and all through the weekends. While they occasionally texted me to say they were ""hanging out,"" they intentionally downplayed the intensity and frequency of their meetings.

​The Evidence

I saw their text messages, and they are heartbreaking. They were ""fishing"" for each other’s company constantly:

​She would text ""look what I made for dinner,"" and he’d be over immediately.

​He’d mention going fishing, and she would ditch her kids to ensure she could join him.

​The messages are full of ""very complimentary"" talk about how much they enjoy each other's time.

​The Aftermath

The worst part was coming home. I was exhausted and jet-lagged, but instead of prioritizing me, my husband continued to prioritize her. He left me at home to go fishing with her or take her out for drinks. When he finally ""dragged"" me along, I felt like a third wheel in my own marriage.

​Their Excuse

They both vehemently claim it’s ""just a friendship."" However, they’ve also admitted to the following:

​She admitted she ""latched onto him"" because she was lonely.

​He admitted he was ""lonely"" and liked having a ""keen, fun, and caring"" person nearby.

​They both acknowledge that it ""looks bad"" for a married man and a single woman to be this inseparable, yet they refuse to admit they crossed an emotional line.

​The Dilemma

They’ve apologized, but they still don't seem to see (or want to see) the betrayal. They are clinging to the ""just friends"" label to avoid accountability.

​Am I overreacting? Is this a textbook emotional affair, or am I being paranoid? How do I handle a ""best friend"" and a husband who seem to have built a life together the moment I stepped out of the room?",1,1771732492.0,u_Nobody2680,0,1.0,False

1rbbkz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/1rbbkz0/cordova_an_id_advocate_admits_id_is_about_faith/,"Cordova (an ID advocate) admits ID is about faith, not science","In early 2005, [_Nature_ ran an article](https://www.nature.com/articles/4341062a) where ID advocate Cordova, and others, were interviewed. Now, we all know what happened in late 2005; ID was proven to be a religion-in-disguise and a violation of First Amendment rights.

So, why does this matter? It matters insofar as it is a window into a confused mind. From the article:

> Over a coffee earlier that day, \[Cordova\] explains how intelligent design helped him resolve his own spiritual crisis five years ago. Since high school, Cordova had been a devout Christian, but as he studied science and engineering at George Mason, he found his faith was being eroded. “The critical thinking and precision of science began to really affect my ability to just believe something without any tangible evidence,” he says.
>
> So Cordova turned to his scientific training in the hope of finding answers. “If I could prove even one small part of my faith through purely scientific methods that would be highly satisfying intellectually,” he says.

&nbsp;

So, unlike most Christians, instead of reevaluating his interpretation of his religion, he has put his faith before science, tainting any result (hypothetically speaking; they will never have any result since science cannot test the metaphysical, doubly so since _""N""_=1).

Not only that, someone must have forgotten to tell him that science doesn't do proofs. So in his confused mind, if he thinks he has proven something, what do you think happens next? If it's ""proven"", _don't look further!_ Here's then-president of the National Academy of Sciences on that in the same article:

> Most scientists overwhelmingly reject the concept of intelligent design. “To me it doesn't deserve any attention, because it doesn't make any sense,” says Bruce Alberts, a microbiologist and president of the National Academy of Sciences. “Its proponents say that scientific knowledge is incomplete and that there's no way to bridge the gap except for an intelligent designer, which is sort of saying that science should stop trying to find explanations for things.”

&nbsp;

Now, **what do theologians think?** Again, from the article:

> Perhaps surprisingly, many theologians are equally upset by intelligent design. “The basic problem that I have theologically is that God's activity in the world should be hidden,” says George Murphy, a Lutheran theologian, PhD physicist, and author of The Cosmos in the Light of the Cross. Murphy says Lutherans believe that God's primary revelation came through Jesus Christ, and many find it distasteful that additional divine fingerprints should appear in nature. Catholics, for their part, have accepted evolution based on the idea that God could still infuse the natural human form with a soul at some point in the distant past. And even the evangelical Christians who make up the backbone of intelligent design's political supporters sometimes object to its inability to prove whether Christianity is the true religion.

Funny that.

&nbsp;

So, while Cordova might tell his audience, “I have a great deal of respect for the scientific method,” he absolutely doesn't. But again, we know that already: [Kitzmiller v. Dover: Plaintiffs' Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law](https://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/pf.html).

That's why, as point #69 in the above shows, other confused people - like Behe - assert ""that evolution could not work by excluding one important way that evolution is known to work.""

I.e. only by bastardizing the science, can their interpretation of their faith be made consistent with ... the bastardized science. _Amazing logic, right there._",4,1771732272.0,DebateEvolution,2,1.0,False

I stay in Kondapur and work as an IT employee. Along with that, I also run a small tea shop in Kondapur.

For the past 3 weeks, there has been a power cut every Saturday from 10 AM to 2 PM. This is seriously affecting both my routine and my business.

We serve:

	•	Tea

	•	Bun maska

	•	Sandwiches

	•	Cold coffee

For refrigeration, storage, and preparing cold beverages, continuous power is essential. Because of these repeated power cuts, I even considered buying an inverter. But supporting around 10kW load is very expensive and not feasible for a small business.

What’s more frustrating:

	•	Complaints raised on TGSPDCL get closed without proper resolution.

	•	The local lineman just says “maintenance 2 ki osthadi” and hangs up without explaining anything.

	•	TGSPDCL responds on Twitter, but the power still goes off at the same time every Saturday.

If this is planned maintenance, why not:

	•	Provide a permanent solution, or

	•	Reduce the duration, or an alternative

It’s disappointing that in a major IT hub like Hyderabad, especially Kondapur, we are facing such regular long power cuts.

Is anyone else in Kondapur facing this issue?

1rbbfx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MossandMercury101/comments/1rbbfx1/the_first_year_teaching/,The First Year Teaching,"As a first year teacher, you get a lot of advice. 

You get told a lot of things that you should do. Things that will help you to survive that first year.

You get a lot of advice on classroom management so that you create a space where students can learn and you can teach. I remember in my first year of teaching one teacher told me never let the students see you smile until after the new year. I couldn’t tell if she was joking or if she was being serious. It definitely sounded like a teacher-ism that got passed down the pipeline from generations ago. But I suppose that’s one way to set a tone in your classroom. Teachers will share how to line up your class, how to walk your students down the hall, what behavior at assemblies should look like, and how to have them interact with one another. Basically, there can be a system of management for just about anything. And frankly, I was glad to be given all of the advice and have teachers share their ways of doing things because that first year, you don’t realize how all the pieces of the puzzle fits together because as an outsider looking in, the puzzle is just put together.

Then, you get advice on how to manage all of the planning and preparation of the lessons you teach. And if you’re an elementary teacher, you are planning for 5-7 different subjects a day. As a first year teacher, you learn to plan earlier in the week so that you have the rest of the week to prepare - and all of this is for the following week with the expectation that things go as planned in the current week. This is a juggling act that you get better at with time. It’s an act I don't think you can ever perfect because there are many layers to planning and prepping - one layer being in the current moment, another layer being for the week, then for the month, for a unit, and you also have to loosely plan for the year to make sure you get to all the standards meant to be taught that year. What you don’t realize as a new teacher is that you are lucky if you can have all the plans for the week actually ready the week before, but the truth of being prepared to teach is that you have to be mentally and physically prepared when your best intentions don’t all go to plan. 

There’s also another layer to planning and preparation of teaching that you don’t think you have to think about. That layer is the actual teaching of the lesson. You think, this can’t be too difficult especially when you just follow a lesson plan. But no one talks about the nuances to teaching because that’s where your personality and quick thinking comes in. There’s nowhere in the lesson plan telling you where, when, and how to reboot if the lesson starts to go sideways or when to scrap it altogether or how to decide to troubleshoot to revive a lesson. Those are all things you learn as you go. Knowing what you’re going to say and being on your toes to anticipate how the lesson is going to go is an art. And in the first year of teaching, your artistic skills are about as refined as a kindergartener learning how to write their name.

This is just a peek into what a first year teacher experiences and my experience 25 years ago. But I wouldn’t have made it through my first 3 years without the teachers I was in community with. I still lean on my community of teachers because if it weren’t for them, this job would feel really lonely despite being with 34+ other humans on a daily basis. There’s nothing like being able to come together on your recess breaks and take a collective, deep audible sigh and know exactly why that sigh feels like you just completed a high intensity workout for the last 90 minutes straight, and you’re taking a breather to do it all again. Or coming together to debrief a lesson and rejoice or commiserate its outcome. Or, just coming together for some comic relief because you can’t make up the things that happen in your classroom. 

Since day 1, I have loved the teachers I’ve worked with. There’s nothing like veteran teachers taking you under their wing and guiding you every step of the way. One mentor teacher took me to our teacher resource center that housed all types of teaching tools and supplies I could use for my empty classroom at the time, while another teacher took me to a teacher store to save me from the overwhelm of so many options of teacher supplies. She basically told me what I’d need because the new teacher in me wanted all the shiny new calendars, posters, pencils, pens, borders, and learning games.

Another teacher guided me through lesson plans and creating lessons to make them my own. In the beginning, that always felt so hard because no matter how well you plan out a lesson, how they receive it is up to them. And then you go into in-the-moment decision making on what to do next on how to best serve your kiddos. This was and always is the tricky part because you have almost 3 dozen individuals and not 3 dozen preprogrammed robots set at the same baseline. Without this teacher taking my hand and walking me through the nuances of teaching and reading your students, I would’ve been flailing that first year. I mean, you do flail, just with more flair.

I leaned on all my colleagues not just with the teaching aspect but also mentally managing it all. This is where I think we all supported one another because even though we all had our own classrooms, our own students and parents of students, and the same year to teach all the material in, no matter how good at managing you were, the fact was it was constant managing. And that gets heavy, you start to doubt yourself, and it starts to feel overwhelming. It made sense when I felt this my first few years, but it’s also something I’ve seen veteran teachers experience. At the time, we all just consoled each other, brought each other coffee and treats to brighten spirits, or found humor in the crazy of teaching - which was helpful but didn’t keep teachers from burning out.

Now that I have decades of teaching under my belt and came back from burn out myself, I literally have to inject myself into mentor teaching mode whenever I hear a teacher talk down about themselves, their skills, or doubt their decisions, and remind that just like some of the stories we get told by our students, that with enough detective work, we figure out even the ones that sound convincing are made up. When they’re feeling the overwhelm, stress, and exhaustion, I know it’s my cue to coach, mentor, or guide them through it so they don’t get stuck in the quick sand of that type of thinking. Because the truth is, no teacher should have to figure it out alone — not in year one, not in year twenty. It’s in community we can do our best work.

1rbbf7x,https://i.redd.it/qea8daa6wykg1.jpeg,"I Spoke My Vows, My Fancies Came True","Chapter 1
News spread through the city’s elite: Darius Lorre, the arrogant heir of the Lorre family, had been in a terrible car crash. Blinded and paralyzed, doctors said he’d never walk or have children again.

The news reached the Beaumont estate. My older sister, Sylvie, a famous celebrity, broke down in tears and knelt before me, begging me to take her place in the arranged marriage.

I curled my lip and coldly kicked her hand away. “When the Lorres were a top dynasty, they specifically asked for a Beaumont heiress. To lift you up, they erased me from the family register, labeled me illegitimate, and made you the only Miss Beaumont.” My voice was low and threatening. “Now that Darius is blind and crippled, you suddenly remember me? Dream on!”

Before I finished, Gareth Maxwell kicked the unlocked door open. He swept Sylvie up and glared at me with pure disgust.

“Seraphina, don’t be ungrateful. This engagement was always meant for you. This is just fixing things!” He threw a prenup at me. “Tomorrow, Sylvie and I get our marriage license. As for the Lorres, you’re marrying him!”

I froze, my chest tightening as if filled with a vinegar-soaked sponge, a hollow ache spreading inside.

…

""The Lorres want a Beaumont heiress,"" I countered, my voice tight. ""I'm merely an 'illegitimate daughter' whose name isn't even on the family register. If I marry him, that's commercial fraud!""

Just then, my parents, Richard and Eleanor Beaumont, stormed in, their faces grim. They tossed a brand new household register and a share transfer deed onto the coffee table.

""Starting tomorrow, your identity as the Beaumont heiress will be publicly restored. Sylvie is a public figure; she cannot endure a lifetime of loneliness, let alone the torment of that madman Darius,"" Eleanor stated, her voice flat. ""You will marry him, settle in as Mrs. Lorre. This is for the good of the family.""

Looking at my utterly biased family of three, a laugh bubbled up, quickly turning to tears. My heart, once a fragile thing, solidified into a block of ice. ""Fine. I’ll marry him. I hope you don't regret this to your dying day.""

My concession instantly eased the tension in the room. My father, Richard, grinned, praising my maturity. My mother, Eleanor, exhaled in relief, commending my sensibility. Gareth, ecstatic, lifted Sylvie into his arms and spun her around twice, relief washing over him.

""Oh, Sylvie, this is wonderful! You won't have to be ruined by that blind man! We'll make our announcement tomorrow!""

Sylvie, sniffling in his embrace, forced a watery smile, as if she'd narrowly escaped disaster. I watched them, my gaze cold, then spoke, enunciating each word. ""But I have a condition.""

Their smiles stiffened, and all four faces immediately clouded over. They demanded to know what it was. My voice was as calm as if I were negotiating a business deal. ""There can only be one Beaumont heiress. I want Sylvie to publicly acknowledge she's adopted, and return all the status and shares that rightfully belong to me.""

Eleanor's composure snapped. ""Seraphina Beaumont, don't be so excessive! Sylvie's status is impeccable; she won't interfere with you. Must you ruin her?""

I looked at the woman who had given birth to me, my chest aching as if stabbed by a thousand needles. ""I am your biological daughter! From childhood, why did you lavish so much affection on an adopted child, even helping her steal everything that was mine?""

Her face hardened, her voice brittle. ""If Sylvie's biological mother hadn't taken a blade for me, I would be dead! I owe it to her to treat Sylvie well!""

Right. Six months ago, after Sylvie’s birth mother—who had been our housekeeper—passed away, my mother had become inexplicably obsessed with Sylvie, doting on her to an absurd degree. When the news of the Lorre engagement first broke, Sylvie expressed interest, and my mother immediately pressured my father to alter my family registration, effectively exiling me to the countryside. When I returned to confront her, she had me locked in the basement for three days without food, claiming I ""lacked propriety.""

Shaking myself back to the present, I took a deep breath, suppressing the burning in my eyes. ""So, for the sake of gratitude, you’ll disregard your own daughter’s well-being? Even push her into the jaws of hell?"" A thought struck me. ""Do you have some leverage she holds over you?""

Eleanor’s eyes darted away, refusing to address the question. Gareth, his face cold, interjected, ""Sylvie is simply naive and timid, not like your scheming, calculating self. Aunt Eleanor, being kind-hearted, naturally favors the more vulnerable one.""

Richard lit a cigarette, sighing. ""It's come to this. For the sake of the Group's interests, we can only let you marry Darius. I'm sorry, Seraphina. Don't hate me."" My father had once loved me, but he was a man easily swayed by my mother and ultimately, a self-serving individual. Faced with Eleanor's insistent whispers and the Group's bottom line, my sacrifice was insignificant.

Sylvie dabbed at her eyes again, her voice feigning fragility. ""Sister, just agree. No matter what, it's still the Lorre family. Even a fallen giant holds more sway than an ordinary man. No one would dare bully you.""

""No one would bully me?"" I scoffed, a bitter laugh escaping. ""Who in this city doesn't know that Darius is now volatile and unpredictable? Not only is he blind, his mind is twisted. Do you not know what happened to his previous fiancées?"" My voice dropped, chillingly precise. ""The Lorre family is currently embroiled in severe infighting, and Darius is losing his grip on power. Once he's completely sidelined, his enemies will tear him apart! You claim you're sending me to live a life of luxury, but in reality, you're sending me to my death!""

My family exchanged wary glances, momentarily speechless. I smirked, pressing my advantage. ""My reclaiming the heiress status is also for the Beaumonts' benefit. What if the Lorre family discovers you tried to fob them off with an illegitimate child? If they retaliate, will the Beaumont Group's stock still hold its value?"" I watched Richard's hand tremble at the mention of the stock price. ""So, I want you to issue a public statement, clarifying to the entire network that I, Seraphina Beaumont, am the only true Beaumont heiress.""

He nodded frantically. ""Yes, yes, we'll do as you say. I'll have the statement released first thing tomorrow morning."" The other three wanted to object but, cowed by the Lorre family's formidable reputation, dared not utter a sound.

I offered a small, predatory smile. ""Fine. The moment that announcement is public, I'll pack myself up and send myself straight to the Lorre estate.""

The next day, the public clarification regarding the true and false Beaumont heiress dominated the trending topics. The entire network was buzzing, siding with me. It turned out the ""illegitimate daughter"" who had been universally reviled was the true heiress, while Sylvie, who had meticulously crafted her image as a socialite, was merely adopted, and was now returning my status to escape the arranged marriage.

Sylvie had planned to announce her engagement to Gareth and get married today, but the public backlash was so severe she didn't dare leave her room. She spent the entire day locked away, smashing things, refusing to eat or drink. My parents brought her countless limited-edition designer bags, but nothing could soothe her.

Gareth, seething with rage, burst into my room. He grabbed my throat, his eyes blazing crimson. ""Sylvie is overwhelmed by the public backlash, on the verge of a breakdown! Is this what you wanted to see?""

Suffocating, I clawed at his arm, forcing out a few strained words. ""You… choke me… to death… and Sylvie… will still have to marry… that blind man…""

He recoiled violently, as if I were something vile and contaminated. I clutched my throat, coughing uncontrollably, greedily gasping for air. When my breath finally steadied, I looked up, my gaze glacial. ""Was anything in that statement untrue? The public's eyes are keen, Gareth. They're simply speaking the truth.""

Gareth was left speechless, his jaw clenched, then pleaded through gritted teeth, ""Can't you release a statement? Just say you concealed your identity for personal growth, that it had nothing to do with Sylvie?""

""Dream on!"" I retorted, my voice sharp and uncompromising.

""If Sylvie does something foolish, I swear I'll never forgive you!""

I scoffed disdainfully. ""I don't know whether she'll die or not. But I do know this: if I die, the Lorre wedding procession will be pulling up to my funeral parlor tomorrow.""

""You!"" Gareth's forehead pulsed with visible veins, his fists clenching until his knuckles cracked. Yet, he didn't dare lay another hand on me. ""Fine, Seraphina Beaumont, you've got guts! I'll just wait to see you marry that lunatic, wait until you're thrown out on the streets to die!""

Watching him slam the door behind him, my heart felt like it was being sawed through with a dull blade. The boy who had once sworn he would marry no one but me had, at some point, lost his sight and blackened his heart. He even wished for my death with such venom. A single tear splattered onto the back of my hand, scalding hot. I wiped it away, the last fragile thread of affection in my heart snapping cleanly.

That night, my mother, Eleanor, suddenly burst into my room, wielding a golf club. She ordered two bodyguards to pin me to the floor, leaving me utterly helpless. I struggled fiercely, screaming, ""Mother, what are you doing?! I'm marrying into the Lorre family tomorrow! I'm Darius Lorre's fiancée! How dare you lay a hand on me?!""

She ignored me completely. Turning, she handed the golf club to Sylvie, whose eyes were swollen like peaches. Eleanor's voice was sickeningly sweet. ""Sylvie, darling, go ahead. Hit her as many times as you like, anywhere you want! Mother needs to help you get this anger out!""

A flash of malicious glee flickered in Sylvie's eyes. She seized the club and brought it down with brutal force across my back. ""Ah—"" I screamed in agony, gritting my teeth as I warned, ""Darius may be blind, but he's not dead yet! Do you really want to die, touching his fiancée?!""

Sylvie, as if possessed, continued to strike my back, blow after blow. Her strength wasn't immense, but her aim was viciously precise, repeatedly targeting the same spot. The searing pain made my vision swim, and cold sweat instantly drenched my clothes. My mother stood by, watching with chilling indifference, even adding fuel to the fire: ""You haven't married him yet! As long as you're in this house, I have every right to discipline you!""

With my mother's backing, Sylvie grew even more brazen: ""Mother's right! You made me a laughingstock online. If I don't get my revenge, how am I supposed to sleep tonight?! Anyway, there's still a whole night. As long as I don't hit your face, what can that blind man see if you just put on some thick powder?""

Just as I felt myself slipping into unconsciousness from the pain, my father, Richard, suddenly ran in, panting. ""Stop! Don't hit her! The Lorre family just called; the wedding ceremony has been moved up to first thing tomorrow morning!""",1,1771731766.0,NovelsSearch,0,1.0,False

1rbbbx3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1rbbbx3,Fly High Desi Until We Meet Again ❤️🕊️🌈💔,"Desi passed away just as the sun went down on Wednesday, February 18. It was quick—a fast flutter with his wings outstretched. I was with him.

His life started auspiciously as a magician’s dove. Due to his small size, the other doves bullied him. I took Desi not having any experience with birds.

Originally, Desdemona, he would settle into my life in Studio City alongside his first love and heartbreak, Othella, a hamster. When it became obvious Desi was a male due to his rooster like coos at dawn and his rapt devotion for Othella, he became more than just a rescued dove. He was a true friend, a constant companion, and a big brother to so many that found their way to my home.

Desi would lose his first love Othella, pulling his feathers in grief but would over the years gain new friends such as rat brothers Otto and Iago, Reuben the betta fish, Chiquita, another hamster, and perhaps the most profound bond with Sylvia, a cottontail rabbit from which he enjoyed a sibling rivalry for attention but also a deep affection.

When Desi wasn’t keeping watch over his family, he was all too happy to travel and take road trips. He went all over CA, but also to AZ and NV. Sitting shotgun as I drove on the 101, 405 or Ventura Blvd., he was as happy in traffic as he was when we sped down the freeway or turning up the mountains. There wasn’t a hotel room he didn’t enjoy, whether it was a good window with a view, a big screen TV, a mirror, or crisp sheets to hop on.

Desi never met a stranger, he loved compliments but mostly he appreciated the simpler things such as listening and watching music videos of Florence and the Machine, P!nk and Cyndi Lauper. 

When Desi wasn’t vibing to a good song, he enjoyed snuggles and pets. No part of him was off-limits from a pat, a scratch, a neck massage or plucking out a stray feather. Kisses were expected even though he didn’t like lipstick. And when no one was looking, he’d take up residence between my breasts with a satisfied expression as he peered up at me. Desi wasn’t much of a flyer, but he knew how to relax just as much as he knew how to get attention with his coos and wing flaps.

Already this tiny apartment seems too still. So many rituals now broken, persistent momentary thoughts of him still rise met by the crushing reality of his absence. He lives and dies in those seconds all over again as his cage sits empty. The impulse to greet him in the morning is met with incongruous space. Working from home, I didn’t realize how often I’d turn my head over my shoulder just to look at him. How many times I said Desi Roo or Desi Loo just for him to hear his name. My day is uninterrupted with the exception of taking an elderly dog for his afternoon walk. So much of my doing anything from filling up my mug with coffee, to telling Desi I’d be right back every time I stepped outside, to simply crossing the room meant a quick hello, a gentle rub of his chest, a shared joke or an assessment of the day. 

It was also like that when Sylvia passed, but Desi offered a continuity with his presence and benefitted from being the singular demand for attention. He grieved Sylvia too and consoling him blunted some of the ache. Now, my heart rabbit and my heart dove are gone. They are memories.

It seems like Desi has been with me forever and compared to the lifespan of rats and whatnot, his time with me was long enough to see my hair go gray, my glasses—a permanent accessory, stubborn lines and crepey skin, my back a bit more stooped and my shadow has grown wider.

Desi also aged with his cataracts, arthritis and the luster of his white feathers becoming more ecru. His health had been in decline for quite a while, but even he seemed startled when Death arrived. 

I would have liked more time, but there’s never enough even when we have it. I’m forever grateful to have been entrusted with Desi the dove. His sweet, gentle nature and positivity will temper me as I continue on with him now in spirit and always perched in my heart.

1rbbalt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Unusual-Apple1929/comments/1rbbalt/ai_genai/,Ai genai,"I’m Abdul Hadi.

For 3+ years I’ve been building production GenAI products, full-stack systems, and real-world integrations at Fasten AI and projects like Tuesday AI.

And I keep seeing this:

Vibe coders buying random $25–$100 subscriptions.
Founders with solid products but no clarity on their stack.
CTOs and PMs unsure what to refactor, what to hire for, or what to shut down.
Developers stuck between AI tools and actual engineering fundamentals.

So I’m opening a focused $15 product clinic.

This is not just “how to build an MVP.”

This is: From vibe coder → real coder.
From confused founder → confident technical decision-maker.
From messy product → structured execution plan.

What you get in one focused session (max 1 hour):

• A clear tech stack recommendation based on your actual product, not trends.
• Backend + frontend architecture overview explained in simple language if needed.
• Code audit if you have an existing repo with direct, prioritized fixes.
• Subscription and infra cleanup so you stop wasting money.
• Hiring clarity: who to hire first, what level, what to expect.
• A use-case driven plan so every technical decision ties back to user value.
• If I genuinely like your product, a shout-out to support visibility.

And apart from solving your immediate stack problem, I give you something more valuable: fresh, real-world tech perspective. I break down modern coding architecture, AI integration, scaling basics, and engineering tradeoffs in plain language so you actually understand what’s happening under the hood.

Next time someone says: “AI can replace software engineers.”

You’ll say: Hold my coffee.

Because you’ll understand the stack, not just copy prompts.

Session details: $15.
Max 1 hour. Focused and direct.
If the first meeting needs deeper work, we can extend. I respect time. Time is money.

If you’re a solo founder, developer, CTO, or product manager who wants clarity instead of noise:

Comment “book” or DM me with a one-line product summary and repo (if available). Limited weekly slots.

Let’s turn builders into real builders.

Things were going great for the last 5 ish years and then she decided to leave her abusive husband this past Winter. She asked me to help her move (which of course I did) and it seems after that moment she changed drastically. I figured okie no biggie, she's just figuring things out since now she's on her own and has two kids to support.

She started pushing me away. She would make excuses to not see me, the texting became me reaching out more than her, etc...

But whenever she was depressed or crying she'd reach out and want me to hype her up and comfort her. Which I did because she was my best friend and I love her. I was confused but I kept silent because I didn't want to lose her.

I bought her coffees, I would text her and tell her how much I missed seeing her and hoped we could hang out soon, and I would even do her favors that she asked of me.

Yesterday was my son's school play. I invited her weeks ago and she said she'd come. Even texted her yesterday morning to remind her. She never showed up. I was thinking ""Oh no, hope she and the boys are okie"". I come home and check snapchat and she's out having dinner and drinks with her coworker (whom she used to hate and make fun of). I lost it, I couldn't take it anymore. I told her how I felt and how bad she made me feel. After everything I've done for her she ditched me and my son.

She blocked me on everything. She didn't even try to explain her side. I was heartbroken and so was my son because now his friendships with her sons are up in the air. I truly thought this would never happen with us but here we are.

We all want to focus. But today, *everyone* feels constantly distracted. Work hours are blended with YouTube breaks, phone checks, mental fog. It's not because you're lazy or broken. It's because the world is now engineered to collapse your attention span. There’s a reason TikTok is worth billions while your to do list sits untouched.

This post isn’t about shaming you into discipline or repeating TikTok beloved BS like  wake up at 5 AM or you’re a loser.  This is a compact, science backed, no fluff guide. Pulled from top research, books like *Deep Work* by Cal Newport, *Stolen Focus* by Johann Hari, and top neuroscience podcasts with heavyweights like Andrew Huberman. These *psychological tweaks* actually work because they’re rooted in how your brain functions. And yeah, you can train it.

Here’s how to actually stay focused:

  **Kill multi tasking at the root.** Your brain doesn’t really  multi task  – it switches rapidly, which burns cognitive energy like crazy. A study from Stanford showed multitaskers performed worse on focus, retention, and task switching. Single tasking is not inefficient. It’s oxygen for your brain.

  **Use your environment as a remote control for focus.** Don’t rely on willpower. Behavioral scientist Katy Milkman suggests  temptation bundling  – pair a habit you want (like working) with a reward (like music or a nice coffee). Also, hide your damn phone. A University of Texas study found that just having your phone in the same room reduced available cognitive capacity.

  **Time block like it's your job.** Cal Newport popularized this in *Deep Work*. Don’t  try to focus.  Schedule it. 10 12 PM = focused work, no questions. Your brain starts to expect it  like Pavlov’s bell, but for productivity.

  **Work in sprints, not marathons.** Follow the 52/17 rule. Based on productivity app DeskTime’s research, the most productive users worked for 52 minutes, then rested for 17. Not 90 minute ultra marathons, but intense short bursts.

  **Start your day with the  ugly frog. ** From Brian Tracy’s classic *Eat That Frog*. Tackle your hardest or most important task first. Your willpower is highest early in the day. You delay it, it dies.

  **Reduce cognitive load with to do clarity.** Don’t say  work on project.  Say  write intro paragraph.  Your brain loves clear instructions. The Zeigarnik effect shows we remember incomplete tasks better than complete ones. So get specific.

  **Add artificial urgency.** Set fake deadlines, public accountability, or use apps like Focusmate (you co work with strangers on video in silence). Creates social pressure without needing a boss breathing down your neck.

  **Train dopamine, not just discipline.** Huberman Lab explains dopamine is about *pursuit*, not just pleasure. Celebrate progress, not outcomes. Check off boxes, track your streak, make progress visible and satisfying.

  **Limit novelty seeking.** Your brain LOVES new stuff. But it pays with attention. A 2022 study from the Journal of Experimental Psychology found people underestimate how much switching tasks reduces productivity. Stick to one mental context as long as possible.

  **Use  implementation intentions. ** Instead of saying  I’ll work later,  say  if it’s 2 PM, then I’ll write for 45 mins.  This came from psychologist Peter Gollwitzer’s work showing these plans double your chance of following through.


All of this is learnable. Focus is like a muscle. It atrophies with TikTok shorts, but it grows fast when exercised right. We’re not wired to work like machines. But we *can* train our brains to work with rhythm, purpose, and clarity.",1,1771730838.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

So, I have a roommate. My roommate has a friend, who has a friend. Lets call her Jane. 

My roommates friend was telling me about Jane, that we have the same qualifications, and that we are both in the same boat in terms of looking for a job in this space, but she is struggling more, where as I have a half decent job. I started suggesting places for Jane to look, to my roommate, with the message eventually being passed down to Jane. 

My roommates friend asked me if he could give Jane my number, to help her out a bit and see if I could suggest anything further. I said sure, and didn't think much of it. Jane text me, asking if i would be willing to catch up with her and just discuss how its all going with work etc. I said yes, thinking its a good networking opportunity for both of us. 

So, we met up and had a coffee. Chatted about careers, the job front etc. A little about previous studies, but nothing too personal. She asked I was bound to this city, and I said im not sure but I am happy here (this was the time I thought I could have said I have a GF but again, didn't feel necessary) After an hour, it was pissing down with rain. I dropped her back at home, again to be nice, and that was it.

Now, I am left with this horrible feeling like I have done something wrong. I got literally nothing out of it for myself. Maybe she did. But all of a sudden, I am worried she thought it was something more than a career chat. I have no evidence of this, but the thought crossed my mind randomly. Obviously my roommate knows I am in a relationship.

It never came up with Jane, she never said anything too personal about her life, neither did I. It would have felt odd saying out of no where I have a girlfriend. I did mention her by name, but never stated ""My partner or ""My girflfriend"" It just felt odd diving into that when in my mind, I was there to be a nice personal and to network.

I considered her to be a very rare type of friendship because we went to one another’s family events, graduation, life milestones. She went to my brothers wedding too since her brother is actually friends with mine. 

Well how did we fall out. Around our late teens the Covid lockdown occurred. We actually kept in touch quite a bit but when the restrictions lifted she joined a sorority and I hardly heard from her. We just never talked about what was wrong in our friendship either but things felt weird. 

I have to add she went through these different ""phases” is the best way I can call it. Which to some level is normal at that age but she’d change her personality and who she was around sometimes. We never spoke again. Some years later she added me on social media and we talked a bit and then got coffee. But she deleted that account I think. I thought of adding her back and maybe trying again. But never did. I don’t have her phone number anymore that’s why I’m putting so much weight into social media.

Since then, I’ve tried to do an elimination diet, but if I’m being honest, I haven’t fully followed a structured plan. I’ve mainly cut out dairy and sesame because I feel like those are my main triggers. I also avoid coffee. I don’t drink alcohol, smoke, or use drugs, so those aren’t factors for me. I seem to tolerate nuts, soy, eggs, wheat, etc. without obvious reactions.

The issue is that I’ve become extremely limited with what I eat. For months now I’ve basically been eating the same few meals: oats, eggs, minced meat, sweet potato, peas. I haven’t really had other vegetables. I’ve avoided bread, steak, chicken, burgers anything I feel might be harder to swallow. I recently reintroduced potato chips and can eat those fine.

I’m feeling really depressed and defeated. It’s been about five months and I’m terrified to try new foods because I’m scared something will get stuck in my throat again. I haven’t been out for dinner with friends or on dates because I’m so anxious about ordering something I can’t eat.

I miss eating like a normal person. I miss variety. I miss not being afraid of food, I also only drink water and tea no soda or juices.

Will I ever be able to eat normally again? Is this fear something others have gone through? How did you start reintroducing foods without feeling like you were risking another choking episode?

I just don’t want to be stuck like this forever super limited for what I can eat I currently am on Pantoprazole 40mg 1x a day and budesonide 1mg 2x a day.

I’m just so frustrated from going from eating like a normal person for 34 years to now being told I can hardly eat anything.",2,1771730235.0,EosinophilicE,2,0.75,False

1rbaw86,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenAscending/comments/1rbaw86/the_psychology_behind_the_rocks_morning_routine/,The PSYCHOLOGY Behind The Rock's Morning Routine: How He Stays Mentally Bulletproof,"Honestly, I used to think Dwayne Johnson was just another jacked celebrity with a good PR team. But after diving deep into his routines, interviews, and the psychology behind his habits (tons of podcasts, books on high performers, YouTube breakdowns), I realized this dude's mental game is actually insane. And the wildest part? Most of what makes him ""bulletproof"" isn't genetic or reserved for millionaires. It's replicable stuff that genuinely works.

This isn't about waking up at 4am or doing 1000 pushups. It's about the psychological frameworks he uses that you can steal.

**1. He starts with gratitude, not his phone**

Before checking messages or doom scrolling, Rock spends a few minutes acknowledging what's going well. Sounds corny but there's legit neuroscience here. Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist, has an incredible podcast) explains that gratitude practices literally rewire your brain's threat detection system. Your amygdala chills out, cortisol drops, and you're less reactive to bullshit throughout the day.

Try this: write down 3 specific things you're grateful for every morning. Not generic stuff like ""my health"" but detailed observations like ""my roommate made coffee without being asked"" or ""I didn't wake up with back pain today."" Specificity activates the reward circuits in your brain more intensely.

If you want to go deeper on this, check out The Upward Spiral by Alex Korb. Dude's a neuroscientist who breaks down how tiny mental shifts create massive changes in brain chemistry. After reading this I genuinely understood why gratitude isn't just feel good nonsense, it's a biological hack. The book won tons of praise for making complex neuroscience actually readable. Best mental health book I've read in years, no contest.

**2. He moves his body immediately**

Rock doesn't ease into his day. He trains early because exercise floods your system with dopamine, norepinephrine, and BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor, basically miracle gro for your neurons). You don't need a 2 hour gym session. Even 10 minutes of movement completely changes your neurochemistry.

The key insight from research? Morning exercise doesn't just boost your mood that day. It actually makes your brain more resilient to stress long term. Dr. Wendy Suzuki's work at NYU shows that consistent morning movement literally enlarges your hippocampus, the part of your brain that regulates emotion and memory.

Get the book [Spark by John Ratey](https://www.amazon.com/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-Brain/dp/0316113506). This Harvard psychiatrist spent decades studying how exercise impacts mental health, and the findings are actually wild. Exercise is more effective than most antidepressants for mild to moderate depression, it's just that pharma companies can't patent jogging. The book compiles tons of case studies and research. Genuinely eye opening read that'll make you view exercise completely differently.

**3. He sets daily intentions, not just goals**

There's a difference. Goals are outcomes (lose 10 pounds, get promoted). Intentions are about who you want to be that day (patient, focused, generous). Rock talks about this constantly. He decides each morning what energy he wants to bring.

This connects to research on implementation intentions, which are way more effective than regular goal setting. Basically, when you decide ""today I'm going to be someone who stays calm under pressure"" your brain starts filtering for opportunities to practice that identity. It's like you're training your reticular activating system to notice chances to become that person.

For building this habit, I've been using Ash, a mental health coaching app that sends you daily check ins and helps you set intentions based on your emotional state. It's like having a therapist in your pocket but way less expensive. The prompts are actually thoughtful, not generic ""how are you feeling today"" garbage.

There's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia grads and Google experts. You tell it your self-improvement goals (like becoming more mentally resilient or building better habits), and it generates personalized audio podcasts from research papers, expert talks, and book summaries on exactly what you need. The cool part is the adaptive learning plan, it structures everything based on your unique challenges and keeps evolving as you progress. You can customize the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. Plus there's this virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with mid-podcast to ask questions or get clarifications. Really solid for turning commute time into actual growth time instead of just scrolling.

**4. He consumes inspiration before negativity**

Rock doesn't start his day reading news or checking social media. He watches motivational content, reads philosophy, or listens to music that fires him up. This isn't toxic positivity, it's strategic input management.

Your brain's most neuroplastic (changeable) in the morning. Whatever you consume first sets your mental filter for the entire day. Feed it anxiety inducing news and you'll be hypervigilant and stressed. Feed it inspiration and you'll notice more opportunities.

James Clear talks about this in [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). Yeah everyone's read it but his chapter on environment design is underrated. He explains how your surroundings and inputs shape your identity way more than willpower ever could. The book's sold like 15 million copies and won basically every business book award for good reason. Clear breaks down behavior change in a way that's actually actionable instead of motivational fluff. If you haven't read it yet, this will completely change how you think about building better routines.

**5. He practices visualization**

Before big moments, Rock mentally rehearses. Not just imagining success but actually feeling the emotions, seeing the details, experiencing the sensory aspects. Olympic athletes have done this forever because it works. Your brain can't fully distinguish between vividly imagined experiences and real ones.

Dr. Joe Dispenza's research shows that when you visualize with emotion, you're literally creating new neural pathways. Your brain starts treating the imagined future as a memory, which makes you more likely to act in alignment with that vision.

Try Insight Timer for guided visualizations. It's free and has thousands of meditation tracks including super specific visualization exercises. Way better than Headspace imo because the variety is insane and you're not locked into one teaching style.

**6. He protects his morning like it's sacred**

No meetings before 9am. No phone calls. No obligations. Rock's morning is his fortress. And the psychology here is solid. Decision fatigue is real. Every choice you make depletes your willpower reserve.

By protecting his morning and following a consistent routine, he's eliminating decisions. He's not choosing whether to work out or what to eat or whether to check email. It's already decided. This preserves mental energy for stuff that actually matters.

Roy Baumeister's research on ego depletion shows that willpower is finite. The more decisions you make, the worse your subsequent choices become. Rock's morning routine essentially automates the most important parts of his day so he's not relying on motivation or discipline.

The biggest thing I learned from studying this stuff? Mental toughness isn't about forcing yourself through misery. It's about designing systems that make the right choices automatic. Rock's morning routine is just a series of smart defaults that set him up to win before most people even wake up.

You don't need his money, his genetics, or his schedule. You just need to steal the frameworks. Start with one thing tomorrow morning. Just one. Maybe it's 5 minutes of gratitude journaling or 10 pushups before checking your phone. Build from there.

Your morning sets the tone for everything else. Protect it accordingly.",1,1771730192.0,MenAscending,0,1.0,False

I get hungry midday and have no energy, I am getting bad migraines and I am sleep deprived. 

/migraines are not due to coffee withdrawal because I dont drink coffee much anyway but drinking water and good sleep helps keep them at bay in summers.

So for context, ever since I started fasting as a fard, it was winter days or autumn days and this is the first time I am fasting in summer. 

Fasting has always been hard for me because I cannot handle being hungry and thirsty. I know its generally hard but I have had people say they can easily go without food for long periods or there are those who do intermittent fasting or diets. I could never be that person and if it wasnt for Allah, I would never fast or go hungry voluntarily. 

So I am looking for tips and reassurance for how you all in the North dealt with summer fasts. If it helps, I have a full time job coming home at 7 unless I am wfh and I finish taraweeh prayers by 10:45 pm.

To put it very very very simply, I was basically unintentionally brainwashed as a kid/teen/young adult that the world would basically end before I was in my 30s. 

So we are where we are now, no kids, just 3 lovely cats, living in a townhouse. While I work locally at a dealership detailing cars, he works typically away from home. Hes a groundhand to a lineman laying fiber optic internet cable, to put it super simply. Hes been gone now for 2 weeks this month, and he was also gone a good portion of last month. 

Recently ive been getting real irritated with him for showing a lack of effort in the 'paying extra emotional attention' since he isnt physically here. To me that means just.. idk, keeping me informed I guess? Like tonight he texted me when he got back to the airbnb, I texted him back less than a minute later to let him know id be showering, hence, cant answer the phone. No text back by the time im out of the shower which, sure i can understand, but after textng back less than a minute after? And idk maybe call me too needy or controlling, I jus would appreciate it he *also* kept me informed just when he won't be available, or when he'll be busy or not on his phone. Because thats totally fine if he isnt texting me 24/7, its the being informed part that I just dont think is too much to ask for. Let me know you won't be on your phone, I dont even care if he doesnt even give a specific time frame or anything just a, hey plugging my phone in idk how long, won't be on it or in the room, would be appreciated, especially since hes been gone and i have been, admittedly, more emotionally needy these past few weeks. What do you want, last week was luteal, this week pms, and now my period in 2 days. I need to see the effort in that department to make up for not being able to be here physically. 

And when I try to explain, I feel like he just deflects with the whole 'so the busting my dick part and making money and providing isnt effort enough?' Or the classic 'ive been doing so much only to be told its not good enough' when ive consistently just asked him to show up for me emotionally more. Ive tried explaining that it isnt the financial support that shows me youre thinking of me, thats just what you should be doing in a marriage, thats expected. Its the time and effort spent on me to *show* me that you're thinking of me. He knows it giving/recieving is one of my love languages, and I love thoughtful little surprises. Ive even suggested he send me some money out of the blue for some breakfast and coffee or something as a direction, and he still has not, and his response was that he needed to be paid more. He was paid a few days ago and the thought hasnt crossed his mind once. 

Im asking him to show up in different ways than physical because he cant be here right now. Ive even tried asking him how and what he needs from me to show him more support, but it seems his response is basically him needing me to not flip out at him so much. Like??? What am I supposed to do here?? Am I really asking too much of him?? To keep me informed, and show me he misses me with actions instead of just saying I miss you? To find a way to be here for me without being here physically?

I feel like I've lost what makes me, me. I got sick before I could try and set up some kind of online store, and have no one to help me. Anything cognitive at all wrecks me. And Im losing my dexterity, understanding colours, composition, ability to imagine... I have so much more drive than before I was sick, but my body won't let me do anything. I've been constantly deteriorating with this for 4 years.

I was a really late bloomer and I think I've got some kind of learning disability (and definitely severe anxiety, as well as ADHD which I can't treat), or have had mild brainfog my entire life (which got WAY worse post infection), so it took me forever to build my portfolio, and I had only recently started getting a tiny bit of headway as a freelancer. It's like as soon as I started getting any kind of foothold, the universe said F-U. Even before Covid my health was tanking from horrible sleep quality, and even when I got a CPAP in 2019 it kept getting worse. But I was semi functional then. No PEM, POTS, MCAS, CCI, OI, migraines, eye problems. Now I'm applying for disability and I won't be allowed to sell my art, if I was even able to. I used to love con crunch, the rush and the excitement, driving to a different province for cons, meeting different artists and becoming friends, going for meals with them. Seeing all the cool cosplays and geeking out over series with people. I stubbornly still look at artist alley videos but it makes me sad.

And traveling...I recognize I was lucky I got to a bit before I got sick, aside from art it's my other love. I was trying to learn japanese (haha help it's SO HARD lmao) in hopes I could move there for a few months and go to language school, I wanted to stay in a sharehouse in Osaka as a base and visit the surrounding areas, then stay in Tokyo for a while. I was scraping together my meagre artist earnings from cons and commissions to one day try to make that happen. It's what I dreamed of. Also my sister moved across the world to Australia so Im missing my nieces growing up. Ive never been once.

Covid stole what was left of my 30s from me, my brain, my body. I just wish I could be upright again. I miss going out, seeing friends, gaming, having coffee, making art for hours.. if you're a creative struggling with this too, I'm so sorry. I see you and feel your pain.

1rbams0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1rbams0/how_to_persuade_anyone_sciencebacked_tricks_that/,How to Persuade Anyone: Science-Backed Tricks That Actually Work (No Manipulation BS),"Okay so I've been studying this for months, deep diving into psychology research, listening to FBI negotiators' podcasts, reading behavioral economics books. And honestly? Most people are shit at persuasion because they focus on the wrong thing. they think it's about being clever or pushy or having perfect arguments.



It's not.



Here's what actually works, backed by actual research and field testing:



 The stuff nobody talks about



Shut up and listen first. Literally the most powerful persuasion tool is your ears, not your mouth. Chris Voss (former FBI hostage negotiator) breaks this down in his book ""Never Split the Difference"" and it's genuinely mind blowing. He literally saved lives by mastering tactical empathy. The book won multiple awards and Voss teaches at top business schools now for a reason. When you let people talk, really talk, they feel heard. And people who feel heard are 10x more receptive to your ideas. Try mirroring (repeating the last 3 words they said as a question) and watch them open up. I use this constantly and the results are insane.



Make them think it was their idea. This is straight from Robert Cialdini's research on influence. Dude's a psychology professor who spent his career studying compliance professionals (salespeople, fundraisers, etc). Instead of saying ""you should do X,"" ask questions that lead them there. ""What do you think would happen if we tried X?"" or ""How do you usually handle situations like this?"" People resist being told what to do but they LOVE their own brilliant ideas. Even if you planted the seed.



Use the Ben Franklin effect. Sounds backwards but it works, ask someone for a small favor first. Franklin discovered that people who do you a favor end up liking you more (cognitive dissonance, they justify the favor by deciding you must be worth helping). So before asking for something big, ask for something tiny. ""Hey can you send me that link?"" Then a week later ""would you be open to introducing me to your contact?""



Timing is everything. There's legit research showing people are more agreeable after eating, mid morning, or right after they've said yes to something else. Never pitch something important when someone's hungry, tired, or stressed. Sounds obvious but most people ignore this completely.



Stop trying to ""win"" arguments. Dale Carnegie figured this out decades ago in ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" (30+ million copies sold, still relevant as hell). The second someone feels like they're ""losing"" a debate, their ego kicks in and they double down. Even if you're objectively right. Instead, agree with part of what they said first. ""You're absolutely right about X, and I think Y might also be worth considering..."" Disarms people instantly.



 The psychological tricks that feel like cheating



Reciprocity is your best friend. Give first, ask later. Buy someone coffee before pitching your idea. Send a helpful article before requesting a favor. Humans are hardwired to return favors, it's one of Cialdini's core principles and the research is bulletproof.



Use specific numbers. Instead of ""I need a few days,"" say ""I need 3 days."" Instead of ""this costs around $50,"" say ""$47."" Specificity signals that you've done your homework and you're not bullshitting. People trust specific claims way more than vague ones.



The foot in the door technique. Start absurdly small. Want someone to volunteer for 4 hours? First ask if they'd be willing to hand out one flyer. Once they've committed to the identity of ""someone who helps with this cause,"" bigger asks become easier. Social psychologists have proven this works across cultures.



Highlight what they'll lose, not gain. Loss aversion is insanely powerful (Daniel Kahneman won a Nobel Prize partly for this). ""If you don't do this, you'll miss out on X"" hits harder than ""if you do this, you'll gain X."" We're more motivated to avoid losses than acquire gains.



 Tools that actually help



The app Youper is weirdly good for practicing persuasive communication. It's an AI therapy app but it teaches you how to reframe thoughts and communicate more effectively. Helps you spot cognitive distortions in your own arguments.



If you want to go deeper without reading dozens of books, there's BeFreed. It's a personalized audio learning app from a team at Columbia and Google that pulls from books like Cialdini's ""Influence,"" Voss's negotiation tactics, Kahneman's behavioral economics research, and expert interviews on persuasion psychology. You tell it your goal (like ""become more persuasive in work negotiations"" or ""improve my communication skills as an introvert"") and it builds an adaptive learning plan with podcasts customized to your pace. You can do quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are honestly addictive, there's even a smooth, confident tone that feels like listening to a negotiation coach. Makes it way easier to absorb all this psychology research during commutes instead of doomscrolling.



Podcast rec: The Jordan Harbinger Show, specifically his episodes on influence and negotiation. Jordan interviews everyone from Cialdini to undercover agents and breaks down practical tactics. The episode with Chris Voss is absolutely required listening if you want to level up your persuasion game.



Book that changed everything for me: ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"" by Robert Cialdini. This is THE foundational text. Cialdini spent years going undercover in sales organizations, studying cults, researching compliance tactics. It's not some guru nonsense, it's peer reviewed psychology research written accessibly. Every marketer, salesperson, and leader has read this. The 6 principles (reciprocity, commitment, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity) are frameworks you'll use forever. Genuinely the best book on persuasion ever written, I've read it twice and reference it constantly.



Spark is an app for building better habits around communication. Tracks your interactions and helps you reflect on what worked. Sounds corporate but it's actually super useful for identifying patterns.



 The actual truth about persuasion



Here's what I learned after consuming all this content: persuasion isn't about manipulation or tricks. It's about understanding human psychology and working with it, not against it. People make decisions emotionally then justify them rationally. They value autonomy. They need to save face. They're more influenced by stories than statistics.



The people who are best at persuasion aren't the loudest or most charismatic. They're the ones who make others feel understood, who frame ideas in terms of the other person's values, who remove friction instead of adding pressure.



Also, hot take: if you have to persuade someone THAT hard, maybe it's not the right move for them. Ethical persuasion means genuinely believing what you're proposing serves their interests, not just yours.



Most of what I shared comes from decades of research by people way smarter than me. Cialdini, Kahneman, Voss, Carnegie. These aren't hacks, they're insights into how humans actually work. And once you understand that, persuasion stops feeling manipulative and starts feeling like effective communication.



The science is clear. Biology and psychology shape how we process information and make decisions. But understanding these patterns gives you tools to communicate better, build stronger relationships, and yeah, persuade people when it actually matters.",1,1771729420.0,SocialBlueprint,0,1.0,False
1rbamoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1rbamoy/my_tv_turns_on_at_night_and_shows_my_living_room/,My TV turns on at night and shows my living room,"I don’t leave my TV on standby.

I unplug it.

I’m weird about electricity and wasting power.

Three nights ago I woke up to light flickering under my bedroom door.

Blue light.

Like a screen.

I thought maybe I forgot to unplug it.

When I walked into the living room, the TV was on.

Volume muted.

It wasn’t on a channel.

It was showing a camera feed.

Black and white.

Night vision.

It took me a second to realize what I was looking at.

It was my living room.

From the corner near the ceiling.

Like a security camera.

Except I don’t own one.

The angle was high.

Pointed down at the couch.

The coffee table.

The hallway leading to my bedroom.

And in the hallway, you could see my bedroom door.

Closed.

I stepped in front of the TV.

On the screen, I walked into frame.

I could see myself staring up at it.

There was a slight delay.

Maybe half a second.

I moved my arm.

On the screen, my arm moved a moment later.

So it was live.

I looked up at the corner of my ceiling.

There’s nothing there.

No camera.

No hole.

No light.

The TV flickered.

The image zoomed slightly.

Not digital zoom.

Like whoever was controlling it adjusted the camera.

It centered on me.

Then the image shifted.

The hallway darkened.

And something moved in it.

Behind where I was standing in real life.

On the screen, I saw it clearly.

A tall shape stepping out of my bedroom.

Standing behind me.

Close.

Close enough that if it were real, I would feel it.

But I felt nothing.

In the feed, it tilted its head.

Studying me.

I didn’t turn around.

I don’t know why.

I just kept staring at the TV.

The delay disappeared.

The screen version of me slowly turned its head.

Looking over its shoulder.

Looking at the thing.

But I didn’t move.

I was still facing forward.

Then the version of me on the TV smiled.

I wasn’t smiling.

The screen went black.

The TV powered off.

When I checked it, it was still unplugged.

Cord on the floor.

Not even near the outlet.

Last night I didn’t sleep in my bedroom.

I stayed on the couch.

Around 3 a.m., the TV turned on again.

This time the camera wasn’t in the living room.

It was in my bedroom.

Pointed at my empty bed.

The covers slowly shifted.

Like someone had just gotten up.

And then the camera feed began moving.

Walking.

Out of the bedroom.

Down the hallway.

Toward the couch.

Toward me.

The screen cut out before it reached the living room.

The TV is off right now.

But I can hear the faint sound of static.

Not from the screen.

From behind it.",1,1771729414.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

1rbajaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1rbajaj/something_came_into_the_house/,Something came into the house,"(I've shared other paranormal stories in here, but this is where it all started, originally shared on bluesky)

Something really SPOOKY just happened.

I'm at my brother and father's house, they're sleeping upstairs, I'm downstairs watching the TV in the living room, lying on the couch with my brother's cat. And this loud CLANG sounds from the corner of the room.

It was really startling, and both me and her lift up our heads to look in the direction of the sound. There's nothing there, and a few moments later she leaves my side and gets up on the coffee table. She's sitting there, her tail twitching like \*mad\*, and she's clearly tracking something with her eyes.

This goes on a for a long fucking time. Her, on the coffee table. Following someone with her eyes, at human height.

idk what she's seeing. The CLANG could've come from the radiator (though I've never heard it make ANY sounds), and what she was tracking could've been an insect (though it's winter and the only insects in the house are, basically, spiders, and they don't travel as fast like the thing did that she was following with her eyes).

I firmly stated out loud a few times, ""You're not welcome in this household, please leave"", just in case there \*was\* something in the room with us.

I'm all for horror media, love that shit, but I Do Not actually need that shit in my real life.

\---

One other thing that I at first was feeling too timid to share 'cause it's probably just my imagination, but...Before I said that ""You're not welcome in this household"" line, I got up from the couch and firmly said ""Hey!"" And I think...I think I heard a very faint ""Hey"" back, right close by me.

Gosh, this' the kinda moments you wish you had those audio recording tools that paranormal investigators use, to capture sounds not clear to human ear.

\---

\[Me, responding to someone's comment:\] The tail wasn't going swish-swosh! I try to paint you a picture of how the cat reacted:

We hear the noise, both instantly looking over in that direction. Few seconds pass. Papu gets up, stretches, gets on the coffee table, settles there all loaf like. Her tail is in a ruler-straight line behind her, flat against the table. It's not rising up, it's not moving from side to side, but there's very rapid, super fast \*twitches\* going through it, like shudders passing along it. Her head and ears are up, eyes big like saucers, her gaze directed somewhere at person height, \*following\* someone/something moving at person height. And yeah, like, it probably was an insect, but it could've been a ghost/spirit too! This' a Schrödinger's Ghost, it's both simultaneously there and not there at the same time.

The couch I was lying on is against a wall, right next to a doorway, and the moment when I got up and said that firm ""Hey!"" was when Papu turned her head to stare straight at the doorway at person height, like someone was fucking STANDING THERE, that's when I decided that enough is enough",2,1771729163.0,Paranormal,0,1.0,False

I’m incredibly romantic, flirty, a little competitive (especially when it comes to word games), and happiest while creating art and home with my cats. I love cooking, audiobooks, and wandering through farmers markets and supporting locally owned businesses. I’m close with my family, have two spoiled cats who think they run the house (they do) and prioritize time with friends. 

I’m a night owl and always down to flirt and chat until we both forget what time it is. I’m a switch, emotionally available, and looking for something real, but also open to where things naturally go. Monogamous and intentional with my heart, but not afraid of a little fun along the way.

Some quick interests of mine lately: creating the perfect vodka sauce, new coffee recipes at home, Red Rising series, stippling, homemade decorations & gifts, the King of the Hill reboot, Cat Burns, bananagrams, declutterring. 

I’m especially into confident women who can keep up with flirty banter and enjoy deep connection. I don’t want kids, but I do want a partner I can build a life with, filled with love, laughter, and endless curiosity about each other and the world around us. Open to long distance and open to meeting new queer friends. If you think we’d vibe, say hi and tell me something flirty.

[There are some rules to this. It only applies to what he considers an actual supernatural power. (Example: Like Sukuna's Cursed Energy, or Goku's powers). If he fights someone who just has physical prowess but no actual superhuman power, then Koffi's power won't be triggered and he'll be forced to fight normally. Luckily, he's trained in hand-to-hand combat. But he can't use weapons very well.]

Of this darkest of years and I can 

Breath again!

My love,  may all your dreams be filled 

May you find peace in this life 

For what we had was as real as the sun!

And it burned for a long time 

And it still burns inside me 

And will forever

I love the historical building and the rector is a kind and decent person. However, even though our town is on the outskirts of a big city, the culture is rural and the congregation is very cliquish. A couple years ago, we had a consultant analyze the parish and we were listed as ""Chaotic"" (Holy Cow Consulting). The consultation noted that the church likely struggles with hospitality and this cannot be fixed by a rector. It's a change that has to originate from the congregation.

I'm not a cradle Episcopalian and no matter how involved I've been in the church, I still feel like I have no significant relationships at the church. I feel very disenfranchised. I've even invited some to coffee from time to time but no commitments. It seems that everyone wants the relationships to be centered at the church only. There are families that have been at the church for generations but I feel like an outsider looking in, even though I've been a member for a long time.

Am I looking at this correctly? Are my expectations too high? Are church relationships meant to remain superficial? A good friend of mine attends a parish about 20-30 minutes away. I'm thinking of attending there instead even though it's not as convenient.",7,1771728308.0,Episcopalian,2,1.0,False

• Medium‑fine grind (No. 27 on my DF64 Gen 2)

• Filled the basket level, no tamping

• Water just below the valve

• Heat on medium

• Pulled it off the burner as soon as it started that soft bubbling sound

The yield was… surprisingly good. 

A few questions:

What are the biggest early mistakes to avoid, and what’s the first variable you’d recommend I start adjusting to improve consistency and flavor?

Also curious if you all use paper filters, puck screens, or just go classic.

Boy, what a let down.

  
We all read about the hopper holding onto beans, especially when using a little RDT, but that's not even the most annoying issue I am having.

  
The grinder just holds onto beans INSIDE of the grinder and just when you think you're done with your grind, it finds another bean and it grinds more. I'll sit here turning the knocker over and over, and it just keeps finding old beans or chunks to grind.

  
I also seem to be struggling with consistency in the grind itself. I find a lot of lumps or clumps in my ground coffee.

  
The dosing cup is incredibly bad. So much static, it loves to hold or stick ground coffee inside of it.

  
Tons of people say it needs a LOT of seasoning to make it consistent, but I feel like I've gone through 10lbs of beans by this point. 

  
Is it possible I have a defective unit?

I just started playing Stardew Valley and I absolutely love the cozy small town vibe, its pretty much what I was looking for - this kind of comfort show energy, soft fall aesthetic, slow mornings with coffee. But im also kind of overwhelmed?

I’m on Fall 24, year 1 and I feel like I’m constantly running. I water my few crops (absolutely disorganised crops, like I don’t know what I’m doing) then rush to the mines, then maybe try to fish, and suddenly it’s midnight. I’ve barely talked to any character all season because I feel like there’s never enough time in the day.

I’m doing a bit of everything (like mining, fishing, farming) but I’m not sure what I should actually focus on as a beginner. Should I prioritize:

a. Advancing in the mines?

b. Being better at farming and money from crops?

c. Fishing?

d. Building friendships?

I’ve not even started Completing Community Center bundles, cause I don’t know where to start.

I want to enjoy the cozy social side of the game too, but right now I feel like I’m sprinting between tasks and not really soaking anything in.

1rb9unp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDad/comments/1rb9unp/just_realized_im_closer_to_my_mentor_than_my/,Just realized I'm closer to my mentor than my father,"My relationship with my dad has always been complicated.

He loves me, I don't doubt that. But he can be very self focused and never takes much interest in what I do unless it's something he likes too.

I keep snakes, I love them more than anything, always have. He doesn't even acknowledge I have them most of the time. Gets a passive aggressive look if I talk about them for more than a minute or two.

He sees subtext in everything even though he knows I'm autistic and struggle with even understanding it let alone using it. It gave me horrific social anxiety and people pleasing tendencies that even at nearly 30 I'm still trying to shake off.

Talking with him is like walking through a minefield at times, and honestly? I'm exhausted.

Even though I'm very close to my mom, I was so relieved when they moved more than an hour away from me.

I'm a chef, and have been with my mentor for over 5 years. He pretty much adopted me from day one and over time we developed a father/daughter bond that means more to me than I can express. He calls me his oldest daughter and shows me off to every new restaurant we move to like a proud papa.

It was my birthday today, I came into work as usual and he had his junior apprentice help him make me a birthday cake to surprise me at family dinner. It was my favorite. Devil's food with chocolate cream cheese frosting and a raspberry filling. I love it.

I realized, while eating that cake, that my dad has no idea what my favorite cake is. Has no idea how much food means to me as an expression of care.

I'm crying in my car looking at this cake and just grieving the relationship with my dad that I wanted.

He's never going to change. He's never going to give two shits about anything in my life that he doesn't personally care about.

It hurts that my mentor I met five years ago knows me better than he does.

In five years my chef knows what I like, what I care about, what I hate, how I take my coffee, my favorite singers, etc.

My own dad doesn't know anything. He doesn't ask and he doesn't listen. He still asks my mom what to buy me for Christmas.

He'd give me his left kidney, but gets annoyed when I try to talk about my animals.

I deal with rescues, I've lost a few. I called him sobbing outside the vet while holding the box the vet gave me and it was so obvious he thought me being that upset over a snake was absurd, even though he went through the motions of being a comforting parent.

The real kicker is that he still has no idea why we aren't close. He doesn't get why me and mom are glued at the hip. He told my mom I love my chef more than him at this point, and honestly? After tonight?

He might be right.

I just want my daddy to care about literally anything that matters to me that doesn't to him. I don't need him to love it... just to not sit there ""pretending"" not to be annoyed.",2,1771727186.0,AskDad,0,1.0,False

1rb9trz,https://www.reddit.com/r/vbac/comments/1rb9trz/6_hour_home_vbac_hbac/,6 hour home VBAC (HBAC),"At 41+2 I had been waiting for weeks for baby to make his arrival. My first was born at 40+6 after a gruelling 2 day back labour while sick with RSV, ultimately resulting in an emergency c-section under general anaesthetic after dilating to 5 cm and fetal distress. I naively thought a well positioned baby and 2nd one at that would come sooner. I was wrong. The wait was the hardest part of my pregnancy, especially since I opted for some hospital monitoring and they tried to coerce me into an induction or c section without good reason.

I went to bed and had a big emotional chat with my partner; we discussed what we would do if I was still pregnant closer to 42 weeks. I ended it saying I want my waters to break after my first toilet break around 11 pm and I want a 6-8 hour labour, not so short that I’m in shock, but all wrapped up before my eldest wakes - and that’s exactly what happened!

11:20 pm - went to the bathroom, disappointed I still had no signs of labour after three membrane sweeps. Saw yet another check in message from a well-meaning friend and told them I needed space. Put my phone down and heard a “plop”; calmly informed my partner that my waters had broken and to get towels. The most impressive part of my birth story is probably that I managed to keep the bed dry by waddling to the bathroom with towels between my legs.

11:20 pm - 2:30 am - for the next three hours, I laboured on my own using a birth meditation and TENS machine (never higher than 3/15, wanting to keep the higher settings for stronger sensations later on). Contractions after my water broke were immediately regular and close together, though they felt short. I never timed them and avoided looking at my phone during labour, wanting to protect my headspace. I tried to sleep and rest (my midwife drilled into me to preserve energy as much as possible as I might be in for a long labour, more like a first time mum since I hadn’t given birth vaginally).

At 2:30 am I told my partner to call the sitter and come be with me in the birth suite I had prepared downstairs. I asked him to fill the birth pool immediately, knowing it would take a while.

At 3:00 am the sitter arrived. At this point I needed my partner during contractions and was hanging off his neck or a door frame if he was not available. We called the triage line for our midwifery practice. They asked if we could labour on our own for another 2 hours until about 5 am. Thankfully, my partner insisted on someone coming to see us. We knew that them checking on me and going home again was a possibility if I was in early labour but felt we needed their support.

At this point, I became more vocal after having been quiet. In hindsight, I was probably in transition. Once I got into the pool, my pain went from 100 down to 50 and I was able to breathe through contractions with the help of a birth comb. The pool was the MVP of my labour. If I had to choose between my partner’s support and the pool, I would have chosen the pool. Seriously amazing pain relief!

Between 3-3.45 my partner called the triage line two more times. My primary midwife was on leave but another one was to be sent. When he spoke to her, she was on her way to a different labouring mum. Finally at 3.45 they advised a midwife was on the way. I told them I needed to push and had pressure in my bum. They asked me not to push and just breathe.

Around 4.30 the first midwife arrived. She set up in the living room next door and largely left us to labour on our own, which felt right. She only ever performed a blood pressure and temperature check and maybe 2-3 auscultations. A second midwife arrived and I could hear them whispering in the living room. I worried they were discussing how far away I was from giving birth.

Around 5.20 am I called the midwife into the room. I started feeling desperate. I had been fighting involuntary pushes for at least an hour but at times I couldn’t help them and my body did a sort of jerky, pushy move on its own.

I asked the midwife for a vaginal exam, explaining I was worried I would do damage if I pushed now. I said I struggled to breathe through contractions. The midwife reassured me and said she felt I was breathing through them with ease. We were all thinking I was still hours away from giving birth. Instead of a VE (“it doesn’t give much information and is only a snapshot of a point in time”), the midwife suggested I get out of the pool and reposition myself on the bed for an hour, to get some rest for the long labour ahead and to help baby turn (attributing an early pushing sensation to a likely need for baby to reposition himself). I was seriously worried I’d need to transfer to hospital for an epidural if I had to go on like this for several more hours.

The midwife and my partner helped me stand up, I immediately sat back down instead of getting out of the pool and another contraction hits. I instinctively panted through the sensation when all of a sudden, I declared “something just came out”. The midwife asked me to feel it and I said “it’s a head”. Then it hit me that my baby is about to be born.

I had a quick moment of panic asking “what’s the protocol here, what do I do, do I push now”, and I could feel him turning around inside of me, which was the weirdest sensation.

At 5.24 am and with the next contraction he slid right out into the water and I brought him to my chest with my own hands. I was in complete shock, as were the midwives.

One of them said she had not seen a calmer birth in nearly 25 years of practice. Normally, when the baby is about to be born, women tend to be vocal but I was completely quiet. I never felt like I was in “labour land” and I was chatty between contractions (sweet, sweet relief that I never got with my OP baby). This probably misled us all into thinking I had hours to go.

My son was born 6 hours after labour started, without any active pushing and in just 4 minutes. I delivered the placenta 20 minutes later on the toilet and we had a beautiful golden hour in the early hours of the morning, until my eldest came down to meet his brother. I got to take a glorious hot shower in my own bathroom (commenting I didn’t even need to wash my hair because I barely broke a sweat). Then got up and made myself a coffee while devouring baked goods from my oven.

Postpartum has been bliss, I got away with an intact perineum and only a small labial graze. Sleeping in my own bed, surrounded by my family, no bright lights, no room sharing with strangers or incessant checks.

I don’t think I would’ve had the same beautiful experience in a hospital setting, even if I had achieved a VBAC outcome. Being in my own safe space, undisturbed and holding deep trust in my body and its ability to birth were key to our birth unfolding how it did.",8,1771727115.0,vbac,1,0.83,False

I was diagnosed with ADHD at 24 and have been on Vyvanse for a few years now. It truly changed my life. But since becoming a mom, I’ve struggled with taking it because I feel disconnected from my daughter when I’m on it. I’ve noticed I don’t smile for hours, and that doesn’t sit right with me.

Over the past few months, though, I’ve made some changes that have helped me feel more like myself again.

1. Hiring a housekeeper

I realized I was spending way too much time cleaning. Not because I’m OCD , but because both my husband and I have ADHD, and our house can fall into chaos within hours. We used to spend weekends fighting over chores. Now? We watched a movie together. I finished a book. And most importantly, I have more quality time with my baby.

Also, I take my car to the car wash weekly. No explanation needed.

2. Grocery pickup

My ADHD brain loves wandering the grocery store. It feels calming. But I realized I was just losing hours of time I could be spending with my family. Now I place the order online and my husband grabs it after work. It’s simple and it works.

3. Diet and quality control

I stopped shopping at my local grocery store because the food quality was terrible and everything spoiled quickly. The experience itself felt draining. I switched to shopping at Whole Foods and the overall experience has been so much better.

I’ve also committed to a power-packed breakfast. My current hyperfixation: sardines, eggs, sweet potatoes, spinach and coffee. I feel fuller, more alert, and more steady throughout the day. Nutrition matters so much with ADHD, and I don’t think we talk about that enough.

4. 8:30 PM bedtime

Sleep is underrated. I’m in bed by 8:15 most nights. Getting close to 10 hours has made a huge difference. Even if I don’t fall asleep right away, I’m still giving myself real rest. I wake up refreshed instead of depleted.

5. The “Things I’m Avoiding” list

I made a list of tasks I’d been avoiding and started tackling them ( a day at a time) One was ordering my bridesmaid dress for an upcoming wedding. It won’t arrive in time, but I told the bride early and she approved a backup option. Crisis averted. If I’d kept avoiding it, I might’ve had to drop out at the last minute.

All of these changes cost something time, money, effort . but they’ve given me something more valuable: mental space. I’ve closed some tabs in my brain. I’ve finished a book. I’ve been more present with my family. I’ve made time for myself. I feel like a normal adult woman for once. 

If you can figure out how to invest in systems that support you, it’s worth it. Especially with ADHD. Eating well, sleeping well, outsourcing what drains you it matters. ❤️",17,1771726800.0,adhdwomen,3,0.95,False

I’m really into lifelong learning and “real” conversations, life topics, ideas, plans, random interesting facts, deep talks… anything that makes the brain happy. 

I’m a slim nerdy twink masc guy, 5'8"", I'm a mixed arabs and chinese based in Indonesia. I’m looking for new friends, no matter where you are from!

Music-wise, my taste is all over the place: pop, alternative, rock, country, orchestral, and folk. For hobbies, I read sci-fi, I draw imaginary maps and city plannings (yes, I’m that kind of nerd), and I’m a beginner at traveling but I want to explore more. Biology fieldwork also gets me outdoors often, so I love discovering Indonesia’s nature whenever I can.

I’m also into food adventures and healthy living (not vegetarian). Recently I’ve been doing a lot of cardio. I’ve had a retinal detachment before, so I avoid activities that could strain my eyes or put them at risk.

For fun I love memes, cats, and PC games like Stardew Valley, Fall Guys, TheHunter, Terraria, and Minecraft (I don’t play them every day due to uni) I love horror movies and I watch a bit anime too!!  Chainsaw Man, Azumanga Daioh, Demon Slayer, Haikyuu!!, Gachiakuta, Dr. Stone, Naruto, Pokémon (I want to rewatch), and Doraemon. Also… I genuinely love drinking coffee and matcha at the same time! 

I’m big on mindful tech use too: phone detox, productivity, deep focus time, and being present offline. It’s a huge plus if you relate. I’m an early bird, I keep a routine, and I plan my days carefully because I genuinely believe time is precious, and I want to live intentionally. I live a pretty structured, disciplined life, but lately I’ve been pushing myself to be more open to new experiences, different perspectives, and meaningful connections.

Most importantly, I want new friends who can truly respect, understand, accept, and appreciate each other as we are. I’m ISTP, I like growth and moving forward together, and I’m big on planning/organizing, so I hope you’re comfortable with that.

So, last night I was coming back from a coffee to my home and he asked me if I had a boyfriend, I lied and I said to him I used to be a guy 3 years ago and that alone made him stop completely. The whole ride went silent which is perfect for me. Use it girls! It works with me! Take care. ❤️",8,1771726250.0,uberdrivers,4,0.83,False
