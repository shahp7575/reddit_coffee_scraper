1q151fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1q151fb/need_help_to_make_sense_of_this_extremely/,Need help to make sense of this extremely traumatic discard,"I've been lurking here for a while, and your stories have helped me feel less alone during this nightmare. I finally need to vent about my recent discard from my ex (dodged BPD diagnosis but has ADHD, Anxiety Disorder + Early Childhood Trauma i.e. ticks the boxes-). We were together for 4 years, and very good friends before that, and it ended in the most extreme, scorched-earth way possible. She was incredibly charismatic and intense at first – that classic idealization phase where everything felt electric. But it quickly turned into a push-pull nightmare - the thing is however, that we gradually stabilised and got to a good solid level. She reconnected with estranged family members as well and that seemed to really help her.   
  
Then shit hit the fan.   
  
Said family member died and nobody told her. Until the abusive mum called, told her and claimed the will was manipulated and financed an unsuccessful lawsuit. In hindsight I feel like this was the moment it changed from me being the regulatory supply and back into the trauma bond on the one hand and on the other - this is where I emotionally burnt out. I stopped chasing and began to react with indifference to her push / pull.   
  
At the same time she grew more distant and blamed me for not getting ahead in life, while I was progressing rapidly at work. She'd start saying things like she ""does not feel seen, needs more space"", and I started saying things like ""you need to take on responsibility, grow the fuck up, you can't always blame others"" - yet I have to admit I became really harsh and hurtful. Even going to places like ""You have nothing without me"". I now see that I was overwhelmed and I am terribly sorry and ashamed.   
  
Still I kept functioning for 4+ months thinking we can just push through this stressful phase...She had this childlike quality – externalizing all blame, avoiding finishing things (projects, conversations, even basic responsibilities) to maintain control (? trying to make sense here really). So it was me doing long hours and rearranging everything so it tailors to her needs while trying to hold the world away from her, yet she'd give me hot / cold or would sabotage possible moments of closeness (even if she initiated them).

I'd call her out on the mental dominance, but she'd flip it: ""You're the controlling one!"" It was exhausting – her impulses meant she'd start ideas with excitement but sabotage them, leaving me to pick up the pieces. In the summer I went on a 2 week trip to sort out my feelings - and now I think this is when the discard began taking shape - she'd devaluate me via phone saying things like ""there's so little chores when you're not at home"" which you know is fair, but the delivery and timing was hurtful. 

After I got back it was off the rails. And one thing happened that burns in my mind - a sexual encounter where we both felt unsafe and hurt - but never clarified it properly. She cried bitterly, and I did too. But not together. 

A few weeks later she'd visit her mum who suddenly was not the monster anymore but a saviour. She'd tell her how I talk to her and the same person that cut her off years ago, prompting us to move in together now financed a flat so she could move out as soon as she was back. That's when the total split happened. 

She framed me as the ultimate oppressor and justifying her exit with this intellectual twist that still haunts me. Before I left for work she'd say ""I am moving out"" out of nowhere. I said ""I don't have time for this now, but how even?"" ""My mum's paying it."" I wrote an angry text from work, that ""I don't care anymore what you do but I won't let you take away our cat."" (we had two) When I came home she was gone with the cat. No contact for a weekend then she came to ""talk"" - yet she came with a white rental van so no second guesses - still we talked and it felt like our early days: we cooked, we cried, we fucked. She weirdly even wanted me to come with her to sleep at her ""new place"". I declined. The next day she'd come again to get some more stuff and I left her an honest note how sorry I am about the things she said, and that I am hoping that soon my world will make sense again. She called me sobbing while I was at work and left me an ""I love you note"" and did chores around the house that are nonsensical if you're the one leaving (taking out compost, cleaning mirrors). 

She kept texting throughout the week and she wanted to call on Friday - we did. But now she was cold and distant - I saw the cat and started crying. She hung up. That's when I snapped and said that she should just tell me when she's picking her shit up and leave the keys, I can't do this, it's too painful. 

Two days later she texted me, that she's organising movers for the following week, that I should keep some of the bigger items, etc. Then it got unhinged. The next day she showed up with movers, unplanned. I was at work - she kept texting me where is this where is that. When I came home the house was destroyed - it was raining all day and it was muddy, everything she ever brought into our shared life was removed - also the things she said I should keep. But there was one thing missing - my fucking key. 

So I called trying to keep calm - but could not hold back ""even now, with you moving out you are unable to take responsibility for what you are doing, get a fucking grip"". hung up on me and sent me a string of messages blaming me for the stressful move, then deleted them quickly after. 

A few days later we'd arrange for a final exchange at her new place - she was weirdly distant and ashamed of my presence and pain. Still asked me for a coffee after exchanging the stuff - she said stuff like ""do you now understand why I left you? (referencing my hurtful words) ""love is sometimes not enough, and it's not unconditional, I felt controlled"" and also ""you're always making it anyway, you're gonna be fine"". I hugged her one last time and left - she felt like a fish and for the first time I felt like I don't know her. 

And she did something truly odd: During our final exchange of stuff, she specifically mentioned leaving behind her copy of ""Anti-Oedipus"" by Deleuze and Guattari – a dense philosophy book critiquing repression, capitalism, and trapped desires. At the time, it felt like a weird ""gift,"" but now I see it as a painful message: weaponizing the book's ideas to paint me as the repressive ""Oedipal"" force she needed to escape, while ignoring her own controlling tactics. 

It created this overwhelming sadness, like I'd been played and then intellectually framed on an elite level that's hard to counter. (She is highly intelligent and intellectual)The next few weeks she kept pinging me with functional messages - until I got an energy bill and asked her to help me sort this out. She demanded that I sign over the cat's Chip registration or she would not discuss the bill with me. Then topped it with - she'd never talk to me again if i would not sign over the cat.   
  
I took some time and went for weekend trip to clear my head. I knew the cat was lost unless I was prepared to fight a very hard and long fight. So I figured there was only one way to end this.  
  
I wrote over the cat, wrote a final message saying that I cared a lot about her and loved her very much and that she should please take care of herself and him. The response: silence.   
A week and a half later she was posting a mysterious insta story that suggests a rebound and contained a cryptified fuck you towards me. (actually it was wuoite obvious and literally said ""see you in hell"" on another guys tshirt.  
I know her all too well to not understand the meaning here - it's literally poking one of my core wounds.  Blocked her. Archived our chats.   
  
Why I'm Posting: Has anyone else dealt with an intellectualized discard? Or that flip where your efforts for balance get twisted into ""control""? How do you shake the gaslighting and sadness? I'm in therapy, focusing on codependency and rebuilding, but days like today suck. Thanks for reading   
  
TL;DR: BPD ex controlled emotionally via push-pull, I provided structure but got burned out. Discard was extreme (pet theft, destruction, bills), with a philosophical book left as a ""message"" framing me as repressive. Feeling played and ruminating hard.",2,1767276617.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

I've also been trying to push myself a lot, but I realised that I was still clinging to fear of getting rejected and heteronormative ideas that I'd get asked out. 

Last night I made it my NY's resolution to be braver and to ask out the women that I like. So far, I've asked out a woman I've been chatting to online (dating app), I've asked out someone from one of my hobby groups, and I have a plan to ask out a friend who I'm meeting next week. I like all of them and whilst I'm not expecting big things to come from all of them, it feels very liberating, even the prospect of rejection!

So far the dating app woman has said yes to a coffee (yay), I haven't heard back from my hobby friend yet, and I need to wait until next week for the latter...but I'm very hopeful as we've been flirting a bit.

I didn’t realize until I was already halfway to work and suddenly wondered why my hands felt too empty.

I stood there for a second debating if it was worth turning back, decided it wasn’t, and spent the rest of the drive mildly annoyed at myself. The worst part is that I kept thinking about that coffee like it was waiting for me at home feeling betrayed.

I'm using a Timemore C3 max grinder, set to between 6 and 12 clicks (experimenting with going finer, and always zero clicked to start with)
- I've tried using and not using an Aeropress filter paper
- I've tried using continuous low/mid power and staying full then dropping to halfway or lower
- I've tried using it directly on the hob or with a cast iron pan underneath, trying to avoid the on/off pulse of the induction coils

I always get splutter, never a continuous smooth flow, I never manage to get anywhere near emptying the hot water chamber and with 300ml of hot water I end up with about 80-100ml of coffee.

My coffee palate isn't amazing (I can't for example taste the chocolate or blackberry or whatever tasting notes) but mine doesn't taste burnt or bitter etc, but I would still like to make sure I'm doing the process correctly. I already have an Aeropress, cafetiere, and Clever Drip which all produce slightly different tasting coffee with the same beans that I can taste.

Where am I going wrong, and what should I change to get the flow?

Every time I (18F) feel like I'm feeling better and happy I mess up once and my stepmom is pissed at me... I feel like I've hit a breaking point and I want to give up on finishing my last year of highschool and just leave, I don't care if I'm in a homeless shelter I just can't deal with always letting my parents down or disappointing them much longer.

I just feel like they'd be better off if I was gone like they wouldn't notice if I ran away in the middle of the night or even care enough to go looking for me.

Yesterday I was having so much fun skiing even after this morning when my stepmom got pissed at me for being the last one ready to go even though I was helping THEIR friend cook since they were having issues and no one told me we were rushing out, even my siblings got ready before I was even done helping cook and they didn't tell me we were rushing out and that everyone was already out of their pajamas and in thermals.

And then when we get home we have to rush to get dressed and ready for dinner in town so I was hurrying to get my shoes, jacket, and snow pants off only for her to ask someone to stay outside with the dog while she gets ready.

I look at my brother since he was already ready and my stepmom just goes ""Nuh uh you look at everyone to do everything but just sit on your ass all day doing nothing you take the dog out""

I'm already holding fucking tears back as I just take the dog out and I'm outside in the cold for thirty minutes because my stepmom rushes me and doesn't even let me get a jacket on.

And then when I can finally get ready they're mad at me for not being ready and my dad accuses me of just sitting on my ass and playing games and my stepmom doesn't even back me up.

And we drive an hour to the closest town only for all the fucking restaurants to be closed for new years day, like I said they would be and my stepmoms all pissed because she can't get burnt tacos.

So we go to a fast food restaurant where she orders everyone ice cream but me because I'm in trouble.

And when we get home I was supposed to make molten lava cakes at 10 pm at night even though I'm full, tired, and just feeling depressed and then I find out we're missing a pan I need, I tell mom and she gets mad at me for not finding out sooner.

I'm thinking I wasn't full so I wouldn't be able to have some anyway and I can get some sleep.

And then she said I should go help my little sister (11F) make coffee cake, I told her my stomach hurts and I'm just super tired and she gets pissed at me and says ""So you were make molten lava cakes but now that you can't you don't want to make coffee cakes with your sister?"" I told her I was tired and I thought I had to at this point cause it was already planned and everyone wanted them.... They just grabbed the coffee cake from the store without saying anything.

She got mad at me and was talking about how she doesn't get what's wrong with me and I wanted to bake and now I don't.

And minutes later when I'm crying in my bunk bed at our vacation house my mom comes in and tells me IN FRONT OF MY YOUNGER BROTHER ""I just think you don't want to do anything unless it benefits you, you're being very selfish right now, I'm not mad I just don't understand what's wrong with you... You understand why I think you're being selfish right?"" I just said yes because I didn't want to start a fight.

It doesn't help that this happens several times a month and they're saying all these things knowing I struggle with anxiety and depression and I have to deal with my brother bullying me daily..

They're even said I was being a disappointment in the past when I went crying to them because I was feeling horrible and said I just felt like I disappointed them all the time.

I play games and draw constantly to disassociate from the outside world, I don't have anything in common with my parents either and I feel like I'm not allowed to cry in the house or be myself around them I just don't know what to do.",1,1767276357.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Due to length this is being split into four parts, and will cover everything Christopher said between January 1st and December 31st 2025, during interviews, live events, convention panels, social media, and promotional content. The two most notable exclusions to this are his Reddit AMA this past July and an long interview this past December, each of which has (or will have) its own dedicated reddit posts, and so will not be repeated here.

Christopher didn't release any major new books this year, and also did very few public events, which leads to a smaller recap than in the past. Most of Christopher's writing time this year was focused on scripts for the Eragon show, but he's worked on smaller projects in his time between script drafts, including the TTRPG, the Book of Remembrance, and Tales 2. (Part four of this series will take a closer look at what *did* get released in 2025.) All quotes are followed by a numbered source, which can be referenced in [a comment under this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1q14wd4/future_works_and_adaptations_christopher_paolini/nx2wdv8/).

This first part of the four-post series covers questions about **Future Works and Adaptations**. Much of this will be focused on The Book of Remembrance, which is the upcoming work Christopher has discussed the most this year. The next post in this series will cover questions about the published books, both in-universe and out-of-universe.

(I have recently been working my way through making dedicated posts for many of the upcoming projects. These will be linked here in the section headers where appropriate.)

# [The Book of Remembrance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1ltcuup/the_book_of_remembrance_the_contents/) [September 2026]

> *So what is the Book of Remembrance? Well, the Book of Remembrance is seven battles from the history of Alagaësia, the World of Eragon. It is a historical look at these seven battles. Some of these are battles that have only been mentioned in passing in the Inheritance Cycle. Some are battles that have appeared. ... It's a brief examination of each of those battles in-world. ... The lore and the information on the battles is canon.* [2]

> *Short version? Seven battles throughout the history of Alagaësia. Seven in-world essays. And YOUR name, in human runes, among the ranks of the fallen. It's going to be AWESOME. Oh yes, and a ton of art. ... And more hints and lore than you can shake a stick at. Lol.* [T] 

> *The Book of Remembrance came about as a way to help Wraithmarked cover additional costs incurred by recent tariffs that were gonna affect production of the collectible Saphira statue that we kickstarted last year. It was gonna potentially put Wraithmarked pretty deeply in the red. So they came to me with the idea of doing something and I wanted to help them and thus the Book of Remembrance was born.* [5]

> *Wraithmarked did a lot of thinking and they came up with a really neat idea. They brought that to me. I expanded on it a little bit as I tend to do. And what we have is something unique, awesome, and I think it's gonna be an absolutely beautiful physical object.* [3]

> *I was only supposed to write one to two pages for each battle, but I personally find dry accounts of historical events, even fictional historical events, rather boring to read. I want to know why this battle mattered to someone personally. And once I started thinking about it in that way and started putting pen to paper, so to speak, things got a little out of control. So the Book of Remembrance is aptly named because it is an actual book. And if you've backed the Kickstarter or you're considering backing it, you should know you are getting an actual book from Christopher Paolini. It's just about the same size as The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm: Tales from Alagaësia Volume One. So it's not a big book, but it is a book.* [5]

> *The Book of Remembrance is turning into something much bigger than I originally anticipated. Thought it was going to be about ten/fourteen pages of original material. But no. It's become a proper Paolini project. Lol.* [R]

> *I'm going waaay above and beyond my expected contribution for this book, because I very much want to avoid this feeling like a cash grab. I can't say too much until everything is cleared with Random House, but, uh, I'm writing a LOT for the Book of Remembrance. Short version: If you back this project, you're getting your money's worth. I promise. It's going to have a ton of lore that's never been shared before, all wrapped up in—what I hope are—entertaining stories.* [R]

> *I think you're going to be VERY pleasantly surprised by how much I've written for this book.* [T]

> *Bryce and I felt very strongly that if Wraithmarked was going to do this, people had to get a lot of value for their hard-earned money. Wraithmarked didn't ask me casually about this, and I didn't say ""yes"" casually. And once we decided to move forward with this, we were all determined that we were going to do our very, very best to make sure this was a top tier addition to the World of Eragon. And also just a cool artifact in general.* [2]

> *Book of Remembrance is already written.* [T]

**Contents**

> *We have seven battles, because I like the number seven. Seven's a good number. The first one is called the Defeat at Amaranth and covers the final confrontation between mad King Palencar and the elves where the humans were defeated. This is the battle that led to humans being included in the pact between dragons and Riders. Then we have the Siege of Kvôth, which is a dwarven siege. Although there's a Dragon Rider involved with that. And there's a certain red-eyed rabbit in that battle as well. That was a fun one to write about. Then the Sack of Vroengard, which covers some of the defeat and fall of the dragon riders. The Ambush at Stavarosk, which is all about how the Urgals wiped out about half of Galbatorix's army in the mountains of the Spine. And then the Battle Under Farthen Dûr, I don't want to say too much about that one. The Slaughter at Gil’ead, which covers the capture of Gil’ead by the elven forces during the Inheritance Cycle, which is also where Oromis was killed, and Glaedr lost his body. And then finally the Fall of Urû’baen, which, again, we saw in the Inheritance Cycle, but this is from a point of view that has never been done before. So we have one, two, three, four battles that have never actually appeared before. They've been mentioned, but they haven't appeared. And then three battles that we've seen in the Inheritance Cycle, but we're seeing them in a very different way now.* [2]

> *There may even be an appearance of a certain red-eyed rabbit. . . .* [T]

> *Writing about the War of Iron right now. Was cut from the Inheritance Cycle (too much info-dumping as-was).* [T]

> *Dragons, Riders, Urgals, dwarves, humans, elves . . . So many names. ... You're finally going to get the names of all the Foresworn, btw. Among other goodies.*  
> **You said back in 2010 that you had named all of them. Have the names been tweaked?**  
> *Tweaked two of them, if I recall. Rest have remained the same.* [T]

> *It's got a ton of lore in it, a ton of cool information, answers some questions, raises some others, and for the first time I got to write from the point of view of some elves, dwarves, Urgals, and even a werecat. That was a lot of fun. It's kind of a variety pack in the World of Eragon.* [5]

> *Never written from the POV of an elf before. Interesting. I like it.* [T]

> *Wrote 72 lines of an Urgal epic today. Not too bad.* [T]

> *Just wrote a sentence that's 147 words long. And yes, you'll get to read it. ... Semicolons, colons, m-dashes, n-dashes, commas, and ellipses. Lol. No parenthesis, though.* [T]

> *I may, uh, have written one of the battles entirely from the POV of a werecat. . . .* [T]

> *Here's one of the chapter titles from the Book of Remembrance: ""The Kicker of Cats: As Recorded for Us by Sister Blackclaw of the Seventh Toll""* [T]

> *Btw, did I tell you that you're getting an official definition for ""inarë"" in The Book of Remembrance? Lol.* [T]

> **Before cats walked across your keyboard, they stepped in ink and walked across your priceless medieval manuscript. They’ve always been agents of destruction.**  
> *Poor Brother Hern.* [T]

**Art**

> *Looks like The Book of Remembrance is going to have a minimum of 40 illustrations in it! Wow!* [T]

> *There's going to be illustrated endpapers, and map, and all this other cool stuff. ... The book itself with all the art, and the design of the cover, and the various elements . . . it's going to be, physically, a beautiful package. And feel very much like it's in-world in a way that very few books ever do.* [2]

> **Oh wow I LOVE [Chris J. Alliston's] style!**  
> *I know, right? Same.* [T]

> **[Chris J. Alliston:] Excited to contribute some art to this epic world! ... I can honestly say I'm not 100% sure what things will even look like yet. And that's the exciting part for all of us!**  
> *I have high expectations. :D* [R]

> *I gotta say, I LOVE my portrait for The Book of Remembrance (It's still a WIP, but pretty much done.) I look like a dwarf/elf hybrid. Lol. This is how you can expect your own portraits to look.*  
> **Will this be used for Brother Hern?**  
> *Nope. It’s literally my author portrait for the book.* [T]

> *I just got to see the first full piece of art of a Book of Remembrance backer as a Dragon Rider. It's SO. AWESOME! Now I want one.* [T]

> *The map is AWESOME* [T]

> *I also have plans to do some art, but it'll depend on my available time.* [R]

> *I've done two illustrations for the book already, and I may do more in the future if I get the chance.* [2]

**Names**

> *The fun idea which Wraithmarked came up with: People who back the project get to have their names listed as among the ranks of the fallen warriors from each of these battles. ... The names can't be canon because the internet is the internet and Boaty McBoatface was a thing for a while. So, alas, the names themselves aren't going to be canon. But it is a way for people to participate in the World of Eragon and have their name in a book from the World of Eragon.* [2]

> *People who back the Kickstarter get their names listed in the book as warriors from those battles. And if you back at a high enough level, you even get a personalized in-world portrait to go with that. Pretty cool.* [5]

> **If this book is now becoming canonically Tales From Alagaësia 2 does that mean the names will be canonized?**  
> *The name lists will still not be cannon.* [F]

> *How are you all enjoying picking your names for The Book of Remembrance? I can't wait to see the lists in the book! [Poll:] Love it!, Call me GRABTHAR!, My name is secret.* [T]

**Rune Font**

> *Did I mention that Wraithmarked has built me a custom font for my human runes? 'Cause ... they have! Sure beats writing out the runes by hand.* [T]

> **Is the Rune font ever going to be published?**  
> *Possibly. We're still tweaking it.* [T]

**Republication in Tales 2**

> *All new content. Some of it may appear elsewhere in the future, but probably not for a long time (if ever).* [T]

> *It's possible some of this material may appear elsewhere eventually, but there's nothing like that planned yet.* [T]

> *The material in the Book of Remembrance will definitely be republished in a traditional manner eventually. So you're under no obligation to back the kickstarter. However, if you do, you'll get an amazing package full of exclusive art (plus your name in it!). Also, the kickstarter version will be available far sooner than any other version.* [T]

> *I can't say too much at the moment, but I'm pretty sure this material will appear elsewhere in some form or another.* [R]

> *This material will likely be published elsewhere in the future so people do have access to it. But you will only be able to access the Book of Remembrance in this form through this Kickstarter, with the art, with the names, and with this particular presentation.* [2]

> *Because the material I've written is so important for the world of Eragon, I don't want it to only be available in this Kickstarter. And I understand not everyone wants to back a Kickstarter. That's perfectly fair. And quite honestly, most of the fandom probably doesn't even know about the Kickstarter. So what I'm doing is writing additional framing material and other stuff to go with the Book of Remembrance. And I'm gonna give that to Random House and they are going to release it as Tales from Alagaësia Volume Two.* [5]

> **Will Brother Hern's letter be included in Tales 2?**  
> *It'll be included.* [R]

# Other Future Works

**Release Timeline**

> *I'm incredibly frustrated that I haven't been able to work on the next book. So I'm making it happen. ... Despite the lull since Murtagh, I'm writing as fast as ever. And it's good stuff. I just haven't been able to share any of it yet. (Sleep deprivation from young kids has also been a stumbling block, but that's getting better month-to-month.)* [R]

> *There's a LOT in the works at the moment. I deeply sympathize with everyone who is impatient. I'm EVEN MORE impatient, since I have so many stories I want to tell. At the moment, I'm saying ""No"" to every touring request. I want to write, and I want to write a LOT. So we shall see. p.s. I also have to deliver a manuscript by April, but that may or may not happen with all the script work I'm doing at the moment.* [R]

> *I did four books in five years recently. Not too shabby. (Fork Witch Worm through Murtagh) ... while having two kids and writing scripts at the same time, I might add. Lol.* [T]

> *Always fun getting to hang out with my editor, Michelle, at the Random House HQ in NYC. #Eragon*  
> **So what book were yall discussing?!?!**  
> *I'd tell you, but then I'd have to cast a memory spell on you.* [I]  
> **But did you have dinner with Simon yet?**  
> *Yesterday, lol.* [T]

**Tales 2** [2026 or 2027]

> *I'm shooting for '26 [for the next book].* [R]

> **When will we get to learn more about the dragon that was born in The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm?**  
> *Next book. (Probably.)* [T]

> **When will we get volume 2 of The Fork, The Witch, and The Worm?**  
> *Working on it, along with other projects! I don't have any firm dates to provide just yet though.* [F]

> **When can we expect publication of Tales from Alagaësia Vol. 2?**  
> *Talking with Random House now about potential publishing timeline.* [T]

> *Tales from Alagaësia Vol. 2 is well on its way.* [T]

> *I'm writing additional framing material and other stuff to go with the Book of Remembrance, and I'm gonna give that to Random House and they are going to release it as Tales from Alagaësia Volume Two.* [5]

> *I'm currently working on The Book of Remembrance on Kickstarter, and that's getting bundled into a larger work, which is going to be Tales from Alagaësia Volume Two, and now it's turning into a full Eragon book.* [8+]

> *It's back to working on Tales from Alagaësia Vol. 2. If you’ve not heard, it’s turning into a fairly large book (at least, compared to the first one). I’m excited for you to read it. So. Much. Lore.* [10]

> *Uh ... Tales from Alagaësia Vol. 2 is getting bigger than I expected. Lol. I really ought to stop being surprised when that happens. Looks like y'all are getting a decently sized book. Not huge, but way bigger than Tales 1.*  
> **You couldn't write a big enough book to scare me**  
> *That sounds like a challenge.*  
> **Is at the point where it will no longer be appropriate to use a Narnia-themed title?**  
> *Lol. I'm actually not sure what the title is going to be (which is unusual for me). The way it's going, it'll be bigger than Fractal Noise.* [T]

> *Tales 2 will be the BoR + Other Stuff.* [R]

> **What’s the difference between Book of Remembrance and Tales of Algaësia 2 again?**  
> *BoR: new stories that are = Tales 1 in size. Tales 2 = BoR + LOTS MORE.* [T]

> *I'm writing additional framing material for the Random House edition.* [F]

> **Tales 2 is essentially Book of Remembrance, right? (Just without the illustrations and names)**  
> *Oh it'll be a whole lot more than just the Book of Remembrance. The BoR will be one of several (large) chunks in the book.*  
> **Will there be additional ""tales"" (besides BoR) included in Tales 2, or is all of the additional content the framing narrative?**  
> *More tales.* [T]

> **I just want more Eragon…**  
> *Working on it.* [R]

> **Will we get chapters from Eragon's point of view in one of your future books?**  
> *Writing a chapter like that right now.* [T]

> **Is there any hope that we can read more about Eragon?**  
> *Literally writing from his POV right now. :D* [T]

> **We want Eragon not Murtagh. I need to know what's happening with the dragon eggs.**  
> *Tales 2, my friend. Tales 2.* [T]

> **Please a new eragon book**  
> *Working on it!* [I]

> **On this day, 7 years ago, 'The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm' was released**  
> *Yikes! Gotta write faster!* [R]

> *I literally just typed an interrobang with Eragon just now.*  
> **I'm focused on the lines ""I just typed"" and ""with Eragon just now""**  
> *Your one little teaser: '""I wish Brom were still alive."" The words left his mouth before he realized it, and he blinked, surprised at himself and at the sudden pang he felt.'* [T]

> *Just named a new Dragon Rider. . . .* [T]

> *I was just writing about Trianna for Tales 2. First time I've written about her in a LONG time.* [T]

> *I was just writing about King Orrin in my latest book!*  
> **Is the book you mentioned Tales 2, Murtagh 2 or something else?**  
> *Tales 2. It's going super fast when I'm not having to work on scripts.* [T]

> *You should know though that publishing moves pretty slowly. First of all, I have to finish writing the additional material. Secondly, Random House is not likely to publish this in less than a year. It may be longer than that because they don't want to put out Tales 2 anywhere close to the Book of Remembrance. So if you want to wait, you will get everything that's in the Book of Remembrance except illustrations, and you'll have to wait at least a year, maybe longer.* [5]

> **Is it actually being guaranteed [that the kickstarter edition will release first]?**  
> *Quite honestly ... I don't know how exactly this will play out. Part of it is going to depend on how long it takes me to write the additional material (of which, I think there will be a fair amount). Part of it will depend on Wraithmarked's schedule and then PRH's. I do know that PRH expressed a strong desire to avoid the release date of the BoR, so ... we shall see.* [R]

> **Do you think this will be released as an audiobook in the future?**  
> *I hope so! If so, it will be with the release of the Penguin Random House edition.* [F]

> **Will this Volume 2 book become available as an audiobook like all the others?**  
> *Yep, Tales from Alagaësia 2 will be available on audiobook like all the others.* [B]

> **Will this book be translated into French later on?**  
> *I LOVE my French fans. However, translations are up to the publishers, not me.* [T]

**[Illustrated Eldest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1mk049t/eldest_illustrated_edition/)** [2026]

> **Is there a update on the illustrated version of Eldest?**  
> *It's in process, hope to have more info for you soon!* [F]

> **When might we get the illustrated editions of the rest of the series?**  
> *Illustrated Eldest should be next year.  Would have been this year, but I had too many notes on the art.* [T]

> *Just saw an initial pass of the illustrated edition of Eldest. GORGEOUS! Few tweaks to go, and some pieces aren't final, but wow. It's especially cool because, although we've had illustrated editions of Eragon, this is the first time we've gotten Book 2.* [T]

> *[Tiny sneak peak](https://x.com/paolini/status/1985516730266067099). (Btw, we got a painting of drunk Saphira!!! Lol.)* [T]

**[Allies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fractalverse/comments/1m89urb/christophers_fractalverse_short_story_allies_to/)** [July 2026]

> *Hey everyone! I’m excited to announce my participation in the UNBROKEN anthology, which is being published to help fellow author, Peter Orullian, with some medical bills. Peter is a good guy, so I was happy to contribute a Fractalverse short story—ALLIES—which previously was only available in one of Ferrari’s end-of-year coffee table books. Make sure to check it out!* [T]

> **Has Allies changed at all since the Ferrari release?**  
> *I made a few small edits, but that's about it. Haven't had time for more. (I actually did more edits on Unity for the print release.)* [R]

**[Ace Savage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fractalverse/comments/1o28wig/new_short_story_captain_ace_savage_and_the/)** [January 2027]

> *If you ever wanted to read something REALLY pulpy that I wrote ... here's your chance! An excerpt from ""Captain Ace Savage and the Fiendish Plot of Queen Dragica!"" will be appearing in this new collection. (And yes, this is the Ace Savage book Pushkin was reading in Fractal Noise.)* [T]

> *First line: ""A shockwave of quantum particles ripped apart the fabric of sub-space as the White Dagger bored toward the hyperbolic bulk of Saturn at over half the speed of light!"" Pulpy enough for ya?* [T]

> *A fitting cover for a book containing an excerpt from ACE SAVAGE AND THE FIENDISH PLOT OF QUEEN DRAGICA!!!!* [T]

> *The Dragonsteel exclusive, Grimoire, will have my Unity story. Labyrinth will have an excerpt from Ace Savage. Unbroken has my Allies short story.* [T]

**Mabinogion Tetralogy** [2026?]

> *Just wrote a foreword for a new edition of the Mabinogion Tetralogy by Evangeline Walton. Can't wait for you to see this gorgeous edition!*  
> **Do you recommend publication order or chronological order for the Mabinogion Tetralogy?**  
> *Chronological, without a doubt.* [T]

**Wraithmarked Box Set** [2027?]

> *If the Kickstarter raises more money than the tariff costs, Wraithmarked is going to roll those profits over into some future, very cool World of Eragon related products.* [5]

> *Oooh, what might Wraithmarked be up to? So excited for this project! You guys are going to love it.* [B]

> **Unless there's a licensing issue, I think the only extra cost [of reprinting the bonus content] would be that the book is a few pages longer.**  
> *It actually is a licensing issue, since Random House classifies the deluxe editions as separate books. I'm working on getting all of that content back into print.* [R]

> *I love a good panorama and this one doesn't disappoint!* [T]

> *Glaedr is looking spectacular! Divebound Studio is doing incredible work for Wraithmarked to capture the dragons of the Inheritance Cycle. Super excited for this boxed set—not only because each tip-in will have unique illustrations.* [T]

> *Check out Shruikan! Not sure how the folks in Urû'baen ever got a good night's rest with him around.* [F]

**[TTRPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1ev8pkh/the_eragon_ttrpg/)**

> *Theoretically, if I were working on an Eragon-themed TTRPG handbook, what topics would y'all like to see expanded on and/or explored that I didn't necessarily go into depth in during the main Inheritance Cycle? NOTE: topics only, please. For legal and creative reasons, I'm not looking for ideas for HOW to explore said topics, just the topics themselves. Think, chapter or sub-chapter headings. I have a number of ideas myself, but I figured it was worth checking with the community. This is a one-time opportunity to expand on the lore and worldbuilding, and I want to make the most of it. ... Theoretically, of course.* [R]

> **We're not sure if the information within the TTRPG is ""canon"".**  
> *Yes, canon.* [R]

> **What were the differences between humans and elves before their melding of souls with dragons?**  
> *Heh. I just wrote a whole long section on this. More info shall be forthcoming. What you're asking about is the Druin. ... Uh, I had no idea that ""Druin"" had been used elsewhere. Haven't had time to google it. Time to change the name!* [R]

> *The TTRPG is chewing up some of my time. I don't mind too much, as it's a good excuse to formally build out the history and world of Elëa in a public way. Think of it as my Silmarillion.* [R]

> *Wait until you see the names of all the locations.* [R]

> *Been naming continents, islands, and bodies of water the past few days. Fun stuff.*  
> **Can I ask for one name randomly, no other info?**  
> *Ïninras.*  
> **How would you pronounce that?**  
> *EYEN-in-ras* [T]

> **How much of the map have you named?**  
> *Continents, oceans, major lakes, major islands. More and more being filled in.* [T]

> **Australonuphis, commonly known as Australian beach worm.**  
> *Nope*  
> **They need to be in your next book.**  
> *Okay. ... Aaand, done. Hope you're happy.*  
> **That was fast.**  
> *I was in a good place worldbuilding-wise to horrify readers.*  
> **I’m not sure if I want to set foot in Alagaësia anymore.**  
> *Good thing they're in Ostduin, not Alagaësia. ... Along with the sand wyrms that the älfakyn used to hunt. ... okay, I've said too much. Back to work. ... I've named the new creatures  ""strand wyrms"". Different than the (much larger) wingless wyrms that live in the interior of Ostduin.*  
> **Are the wingless wyrms the sand vipers you tweeted about back in August?**  
> *Yup, same thing.*  
> **Are they the size in the video, or the size the worm things in Dune were?**  
> *Big enough to swallow a hand or foot in a single bite.*  
> **Would these be considered the earth wyrms you warned about?**  
> *Not quite.* [T]

**[Murtagh 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1mzqnc2/murtagh_2/)**

> **Murtagh - The weakest rider in history of Alagaësia**  
> *Heh. You'll get some further exploration and explanations of most of these points in Murtagh #2. One of the difficulties of Murtagh #1 is that Murtagh spends so much time alone with Thorn ... and Thorn already knows everything in Murtagh's head. And there was only so much introspection that I could fit in without TOTALLY bogging down the story. Which means Murtagh needs some companions to go adventuring with him. ... It's possible that I miscalculated slightly over how different Murtagh would feel to readers from his own POV. However, I'm confident that Murtagh #2 will address a lot of that. Murtagh is over his sophomore slump and is ready to roar.*  
> *p.s. Oh yes, and I totally agree that Thorn needs a bigger role. All of that and more to come.* [R]

> **If the Book of Remembrance hits $1 million on Kickstarter, I say we deserve another teaser for the Murtagh sequel.**  
> *If it hits $1 million on #Kickstarter ... heck yeah!* [T]

> *Now I can focus on getting you that sneak peak of Murtagh 2* [T]

> *Alright, I have the Murtagh 2 teaser for you. Need to get a few other eyes on it, and then we'll post it beginning of next week.*  
> **Rumor has it it was supposed to be much longer but was cut down to its current size**  
> *It shows.* [T]

> *Hey, everyone! As promised, here’s a [sneak peek of Murtagh #2](https://www.paolini.net/2025/08/19/sneak-peak-at-murtagh-ii/) (yes, I have a title, no I can't share it yet) as a reward for helping the Book of Remembrance hit a million! Thank you so much! Fair warning, this is a raw first draft, and everything and anything is subject to change.*  
> *p.s. This takes place directly after Tales From Alagaësia Vol. 2. (Not published yet.)*  
> *p.p.s. Fair warning there are (minor) spoilers in this excerpt.*  
> **I thought that Dauthdaertya is a plural term**  
> *So it is. Good catch. As I said, first draft. Will get it fixed.*  
> **Rahna is also misspelled as Rhana**

**Star Sapphire story**

# Adaptations

**[Graphic Novels](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1osliz6/baby_saphira_picture_book/)**

> *Out of curiosity (and purely theoretically) ... are there any artists or styles that y'all think would be a good fit for a graphic novel set in Alagaësia? Any and all recommendations welcome. ... purely for theoretical reasons, of course.* [T]

**Immersive Theater**

> **Is there a scene, a story, a moment, in your writing that you would want to see come together in a live action  immersive theater experience capacity?**  
> *Maybe an obvious answer, but I would love to see the scene early in Eragon when Brom the storyteller tells the story  of the fall of the Dragon Riders. To have him come forward on stage, have a fire, have actors, have music. It'd be fantastic.* [9]

**Video Games**

> *I want a video game set entirely in Tronjheim. Myst + Heavy Rain/LA Noire + Lord of the Rings.*  
> **Would you accept any Witcher 3 influence here?**  
> *Never played it, but theoretically yes.* [T]

> **Have you played any of the video game adaptations?**  
> *Only the Xbox one (which had some extra content, I believe, like Isidar Mithrim).* [T]

**[Eragon Show Updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1hrldto/tv_show/m4zlpqn/)**

> **I personally feel the disney show is distracting Christopher from writing the next book, eating up too much of his time.**  
> *I actually happen to agree. Should know very soon what's happening with the show. If it formally gets greenlit ... that's a lot more time I'll have to spend on scripts. If not, then it's full speed ahead with more books.* [R]

> *Heh. Been a while since I had [a WGA card].* [T]

> *I'm currently working on a couple of top secret screenwriting projects that I can't talk about. I recently posted I got my WGA membership card recently. I used to have one but I got it again, which is fun.* [1]

> *Btw, Disney+ Eragon show is still on track. Can't say anything more until a major contract gets signed. (Hollywood negotiations take* \**forever*\**.)* [T]

> **Michael Bay and James Cameron recently mourned the current state of Hollywood: “No one can greenlight anything anymore. It’s just so slow. It’s a very different business”**  
> *Heh. I'll have to ask Cameron about that sometime. Doesn't surprise me. Been my experience as well.* [T]

> *Btw, for any of you who are authors ... the amount of revision in Hollywood is INSANE. Totally eclipses what we go through in publishing (and I do a LOT of revision on my books).*  
> **Don't let them revise it TOO much**  
> *Heh. Funnily enough, it's gotten closer to the book over this process. Sometimes I just want to say, ""I told you so..."" Lol.* [T]

> *The Book of Remembrance has been fun to work on in-between drafts of scripts. (I do a draft, send back to showrunner, work on BoR for a few days, get a new draft to revise, etc. Keeps things interesting.)* [T]

> *We're making real progress. No guarantees, but ... looking good at the moment.* [T]

**To Sleep Show Updates**

At least for me, when you're writing or building a story, it's almost like a Markov chain, you're going through this entire sequence of decisions. You do this sometimes for years on a certain story, and you build this edifice, essentially. If someone's adapting it, they come in and they're looking at the story as a finished product. They probably have to change it to adapt it, to make it fit for another medium, but they haven't gone through that whole decision tree that you went through in order to create the original story. And so, unless they're willing to put in serious work over a very long time to understand why, it's very easy to say, ""we'll change this, or we'll change that"", without necessarily realizing the downstream consequences of that. We can think of lots of examples where they change something early on because whatever Hollywood reason, and then the flavor of the project just completely diverges from the original material. Which could be a good thing, could be a bad thing, but most times it's not what people want.* [7]

As far as fantasy goes, it's more limited, but that's because it's a harder topic. Animation, of course, there's a lot of freedom there. Graphic novels, there's a lot of freedom there. I like live action, but it's gotta be done right.* [7]",1,1767276202.0,Eragon,1,1.0,False
1q14wah,https://www.reddit.com/r/transguns/comments/1q14wah/understanding_concealed_carry/,Understanding Concealed Carry,"Good morning/afternoon/evening,

Something I've been struggling with understanding after treading into the firearms community last year is the CCW mindset. Not so much the why, but moreso the how of it. 

I've been training with firearms for a few weeks now, and while I certainly can understand owning one for personal/community/home defense I'm having a hard time coming to terms with strapping a weapon to my belt every morning to go get coffee. This is likely largely due to living in a part of the US that is indifferent to Trans folk, but I still think of Jonathan Joss and the numerous other trans, black, or minority groups that have suffered death without defense. 

At the same time I can't help but feel... paranoid to some extent (for valid reasons or not) with the thought of me walking around with a weapon on my belt at my local Costco. So I've come to this community to understand the CCW mindset more in depth, and figure out how/what clicked in your head in order for you to start CCing on a regular, or even semi-regular, basis. 

Thank you so much for your time, and I hope that you have a great new year <3",2,1767276197.0,transguns,2,1.0,False

1q14unh,https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1q14unh/improvements_between_qwen_image_and_qwen_image/,Improvements between Qwen Image and Qwen Image 2511 (mostly),"Hi,

  
I tried a few prompts I had collected for measuring prompt adherence of various models, and ran them again with the latest Qwen Image 2512.

TLDR: there is a measurable increase in image quality and prompt adherence in my opinion. 

  
The images were generated using the recommanded 40 steps, with euler beta, best out of 4 generations.

Prompt #1: the cyberpunk selfie

*A hyper-detailed, cinematic close-up selfie shot in a cyberpunk megacity environment, framed as if taken with a futuristic augmented-reality smartphone. The composition is tight on three young adults—two women and one man—posing together at arm’s length, their faces illuminated by the neon chaos of the city. The photo should feel gritty, futuristic, and authentic, with ultra-sharp focus on the faces, intricate skin textures, reflections of neon lights, cybernetic implants, and the faint atmospheric haze of rain-damp air. The background should be blurred with bokeh from glowing neon billboards, holograms, and flickering advertisements in colors like electric blue, magenta, and acid green.*

*The first girl, on the left, has warm bronze skin with micro-circuit tattoos faintly glowing along her jawline and temples, like embedded circuitry under the skin. Her eyes are hazel, enhanced with subtle digital overlays, tiny lines of data shimmering across her irises when the light catches them. Her hair is thick, black, and streaked with neon blue highlights, shaved at one side to reveal a chrome-plated neural jack. Her lips curve into a wide smile, showing a small gold tooth cap that reflects the neon light. The faint glint of augmented reality lenses sits over her pupils, giving her gaze a futuristic intensity.*

*The second girl, on the right, has pale porcelain skin with freckles, though some are replaced with delicate clusters of glowing nano-LEDs arranged like constellations across her cheeks. Her face is angular, with sharp cheekbones accentuated by the high-contrast neon lighting. She has emerald-green cybernetic eyes, with a faint circular HUD visible inside, and a subtle lens flare effect in the pupils. Her lips are painted matte black, and a silver septum ring gleams under violet neon light. Her hair is platinum blonde with iridescent streaks, straight and flowing, with strands reflecting holographic advertisements around them. She tilts her head toward the lens with a half-smile that looks playful yet dangerous, her gaze almost predatory.*

*The man, in the center and slightly behind them, has tan skin with a faint metallic sheen at the edges of his jaw where cybernetic plating meets flesh. His steel-gray eyes glow faintly with artificial enhancement, thin veins of light radiating outward like cracks of electricity. A faint scar cuts across his left eyebrow, but it is partially reinforced with a chrome implant. His lips form a confident smirk, a thin trail of smoke curling upward from the glowing tip of a cyber-cig between his fingers. His hair is short, spiked with streaks of neon purple, slightly wet from the drizzle. He wears a black jacket lined with faintly glowing circuitry that pulses like veins of light across his collar.*

*The lighting is moody and saturated with neon: electric pinks, blues, and greens paint their faces in dynamic contrasts. Droplets of rain cling to their skin and hair, catching the neon glow like tiny prisms. Reflections of holographic ads shimmer in their eyes. Subtle lens distortion from the selfie framing makes the faces slightly exaggerated at the edges, adding realism.*

*The mood is rebellious, electric, and hyper-modern, blending candid warmth with the raw edge of a cyberpunk dystopia. Despite the advanced tech, the moment feels intimate: three friends, united in a neon-drenched world of chaos, capturing a fleeting instant of humanity amidst the synthetic glow.*

Not only is image quality (and skin) significantly improved, but the model missed less elements from the prompt. Still not perfect, though. 



Prompt #2 : the renaissance technosaint

*A grand Renaissance-style oil painting, as if created by a master such as Caravaggio or Raphael, depicting an unexpected modern subject: a hacker wearing a VR headset, portrayed with the solemn majesty of a religious figure. The painting is composed with a dramatic chiaroscuro effect: deep shadows dominate the background while radiant golden light floods the central figure, symbolizing revelation and divine inspiration.*

*The hacker sits at the center of the canvas in three-quarter view, clad in simple dark clothing that contrasts with the rich fabric folds often seen in Renaissance portraits. His hands are placed reverently on an open laptop that resembles an illuminated manuscript. His head is bowed slightly forward, as if in deep contemplation, but his face is obscured by a sleek black VR headset, which gleams with reflected highlights. Despite its modernity, the headset is rendered with the same meticulous brushwork as a polished chalice or crown in a sacred altarpiece.*

*Around the hacker’s head shines a halo of golden light, painted in radiant concentric circles, recalling the divine aureoles of saints. This halo is not traditional but fractured, with angular shards of digital code glowing faintly within the gold, blending Renaissance piety with cybernetic abstraction. The golden light pours downward, illuminating his hands and casting luminous streaks across his laptop, making the device itself appear like a holy relic.*

*The background is dark and architectural, suggesting the stone arches of a cathedral interior, half-lost in shadow. Columns rise in the gloom, while faint silhouettes of angels or allegorical figures appear in the corners, holding scrolls that morph into glowing data streams. The palette is warm and rich: ochres, umbers, deep carmines, and the brilliant gold of divine illumination. Subtle cracks in the painted surface give it the patina of age, as if this sacred image has hung in a chapel for centuries.*

*The style should be authentically Renaissance: textured oil brushstrokes, balanced composition, dramatic use of light and shadow, naturalistic anatomy. Every detail of fabric, skin, and light is rendered with reverence, as though this hacker is a prophet of the digital age. The VR headset, laptop, and digital motifs are integrated seamlessly into the sacred iconography, creating an intentional tension between the ancient style and the modern subject.*

*The mood is sublime, reverent, and paradoxical: a celebration of knowledge and vision, as if technology itself has become a vessel of divine enlightenment. It should feel both anachronistic and harmonious, a painting that could hang in a Renaissance chapel yet unmistakably belongs to the cyber age.*

We still can't have a decent Renaissance-style VR headset, but it's clearly improved (even though the improved face makes it less Raphaelite in my layman's opinion). 

  
Prompt #3 : Roger Rabbit Santa

*A hyper-realistic, photographic depiction of a luxurious Parisian penthouse living room at night, captured in sharp detail with cinematic lighting. The space is ultra-modern, sleek, and stylish, with floor-to-ceiling glass windows that stretch the entire wall, overlooking the glittering Paris skyline. The Eiffel Tower glows in the distance, its lights shimmering against the night sky. The interior design is minimalist yet opulent: polished marble floors, a low-profile Italian leather sofa in charcoal gray, a glass coffee table with chrome legs, and a suspended designer fireplace with a soft orange flame casting warm reflections across the room. Subtle decorative accents—abstract sculptures, high-end books, and a large contemporary rug in muted tones—anchor the aesthetic.*

*Into this elegant, hyperrealistic scene intrudes something utterly fantastical and deliberately out of place: a cartoonish, classic Santa Claus sneaking across the room on tiptoe. He is rendered in a vintage 1940s–1950s cartoon style, with exaggerated rounded proportions, oversized boots, bright red suit, comically bulging belly, fluffy white beard, and a sack of toys slung over his back. His expression is mischievous yet playful, eyes wide and darting as if he’s been caught in the act. His red suit has bold, flat shading and thick black outlines, making him look undeniably drawn rather than photographed.*

*The contrast between the realistic environment and the cartoony Santa is striking: the polished marble reflects the glow of the fireplace realistically, while Santa casts a simple, flat, 2D-style shadow that doesn’t quite match the physical lighting, enhancing the surreal ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" effect. His hotte (sack of toys) bounces with exaggerated squash-and-stretch animation style, defying the stillness of the photorealistic room.*

*Through the towering glass windows behind him, another whimsical element appears: Santa’s sleigh hovering in mid-air, rendered in the same vintage cartoon style as Santa. The sleigh is pulled by reindeer that flap comically oversized hooves, frozen mid-leap in exaggerated poses, with little puffs of animated smoke trailing behind them. The glowing neon of Paris reflects off the glass, mixing realistically with the flat, cel-shaded cartoon outlines of the sleigh, heightening the uncanny blend of real and drawn worlds.*

*The overall mood is playful and surreal, balancing luxury and absurdity. The image should feel like a carefully staged photograph of a high-end penthouse, interrupted by a cartoon character stepping right into reality. The style contrast must be emphasized: photographic realism in the architecture, textures, and city view, versus cartoon simplicity in Santa and his sleigh. This juxtaposition should create a whimsical tension, evoking the exact “Roger Rabbit effect”: two incompatible realities colliding in one frame, yet blending seamlessly into a single narrative moment.*

Finally a model that can (sometimes) draw Santa's sled without adding Santa in it. Not perfect, mostly with the sled consistently being drawn inside the room, but that's not the worst to correct. Santa's shadow still isn't cartoony solid. 



Prompt #4:

*A dark, cinematic laboratory interior filled with strange machinery and glowing chemical tanks. At the center of the composition stands a large transparent glass cage, reinforced with metallic frames and covered in faint reflections of flickering overhead lights. Inside the cage is a young blonde woman serving as a test subject from a zombification expermient. Her hair is shoulder-length, messy, and illuminated by the eerie light of the environment. She wears a simple, pale hospital-style gown, clinging slightly to her figure in the damp atmosphere. Her face is partly visible but blurred through the haze, showing a mixture of fear and resignation.*

*From nozzles built into the walls of the cage, a dense green gas hisses and pours out, swirling like toxic smoke. The gas quickly fills the enclosure, its luminescent glow obscuring most of the details inside. Only fragments of the woman’s silhouette are visible through the haze: the outline of her raised hands pressed against the glass, the curve of her shoulders, the pale strands of hair floating in the mist. The gas is so thick it seems to radiate outward, tinting the entire scene in sickly green tones.*

*Outside the cage, in the foreground, stands a mad scientist. He has an eccentric, unkempt appearance: wild, frizzy gray hair sticking in all directions, a long lab coat stained with chemicals, and small round glasses reflecting the glow of the cage. His expression is maniacally focused, a grin half-hidden as he scribbles furiously into a leather-bound notebook. The notebook is filled with incomprehensible diagrams and notes, his pen moving fast as if documenting every second of the experiment. One hand holds the notebook against his hip, while the other moves quickly, writing with obsessive energy.*

*The laboratory itself is cluttered and chaotic: wires snake across the floor, glass beakers bubble with strange liquids, and metallic instruments hum with faint vibrations. The lighting is dramatic, mostly coming from the cage itself and the glowing gas, creating sharp shadows and streaks of green reflected on the scientist’s glasses and lab coat.*

*The atmosphere is oppressive and heavy, like a scene from a gothic science-fiction horror film. The key effect is the visual contrast: the young woman’s fragile form almost lost in the swirling toxic mist, versus the sharp, manic figure of the scientist calmly taking notes as if this cruelty is nothing more than data collection.*

*The overall mood: unsettling, surreal, and cinematic—a blend of realism and nightmarish exaggeration, with the gas obscuring most details, making the viewer struggle to see clearly what happens within the glass cage.*

  
Original Qwen:

Again, much better IMHO, though the concept of pouring the gas into the cage still escape the model. A good basis, though (I can see just photobashing a metal tube going from the one at the left and the outlet in the glass cage, erase the green fog outside the cage and run it through an I2I with very low denoise...

  
Prompt #5 : the VHS slasher film cover.

  
*A cinematic horror movie poster in 1980s slasher style, set in a dark urban alley lit by a single flickering neon sign. In the forefront, a teenage girl in retro-mirror skates looks, freeze mid-motion, her eyes wide mouth and open in a scream. Her outfit is colorful and vintage: striped knee socks, denim shorts, and a T-shirt with bold 80s print. She is dramatically backlit, casting a long shadow across the wet pavement. Towering behind her is the silhouette of a masked killer, wearing a grimy hockey mask that hides his face completely. He wields a long gleaming samurai sword, raised menacingly, the blade catching the light, impaling the girl. On both side of the girl, the wound gushes with blood. The killer's body language is threatening and powerful, while the girl's posture conveys shock and helplessness. The entire composition feels like a horror movie still: mist curling around the street, neon reflections in puddles, posters peeling from walls brick. The colors are highly saturated in 80s horror style — neon pinks, blood reds, sickly greens. At the bottom of the image, bold block letters spell out a fake horror movie title ""Horror at Horrorville"", though this was a vintage VHS cover.*

The newer model is better at gore. But it still can't do much in that department. I tried to get it to draw a headless, decapitated orc, with its severed neck spewing blood, but it won't. 

  
For reference, here is the best of 16 (it takes approximately the same running time to do 16 images with ZIT than 4 with Qwen 2512)  I got with ZIT for the same prompts:

While ZIT Turbo is great for its small size, it is less apt at prompt adherence than Qwen 2512. Maybe we need a large model based on ZIT's architecture. 

  
Qwen 2512 is also the first model that does very complex scenes, either with unusual poses:

*A master samurai performing an acrobatic backflip off a galloping horse, frozen in mid-air at the peak of motion. His body is perfectly balanced and tense, armor plates shifting with the movement, silk cords and fabric trailing behind him. The samurai has his bow fully drawn while upside down, muscles taut, eyes locked with absolute focus on his target.*

*Nearby, a powerful tiger sits calmly yet menacingly on the ground, its massive body coiled with latent strength. Its striped fur is illuminated by dramatic light, eyes sharp and unblinking, watching the airborne warrior with predatory intelligence.*

*The scene takes place in a wild, untamed landscape — tall grass bending under the horse’s charge, dust and leaves suspended in the air, the moment stretched in time. The horse continues forward beneath the samurai, muscles straining, mane flowing, captured mid-stride.*

*The composition emphasizes motion and tension: a dynamic diagonal framing, cinematic depth of field, dramatic lighting with strong contrasts, subtle motion blur on the environment but razor-sharp focus on the samurai and the tiger.*

All in all, I'd say there is a significant increase in quality between the August 2025 Qwen model and the December 2025 Qwen model. I hope they keep releasing open source models with this trend of improving quality.

Since it's mostly about the game itself than the anime, I figured it would fit better to post here.

# TL;DR

* **On the Anime Adaptation:** The producer admits GNOSIA was considered ""impossible"" to animate due to its gameplay loop. The TV Anime is treated as a ""different world line/timeline"" rather than a direct 1:1 adaptation. It expands on settings not shown in the game and features rewritten dialogue to suit a linear narrative.
* **Character Origins:** Surprisingly, the 14 characters were not created via traditional writing first. They were defined by observing the behaviors and quirks of the computer algorithms (AI) during thousands of test plays of the werewolf logic. The personality and story were retrofitted to match how the AI behaved.
* **""Narrative Through System"":** Kawakatsu emphasizes that for GNOSIA, the story isn't just text; it's told through the game mechanics (e.g., invisible parameters that carry over between loops so characters ""feel"" like they remember you).
* **Petit Depotto's Roots:** The team was formed by four friends (including a former salesman and T&E Soft employee) who wanted to make games they wanted to play that didn't exist yet. Their first hit, Unholy Heights, was funded by their day jobs.
* **Future Projects:** Petit Depotto is currently in the concept phase for their **3rd title**. They do not plan to make a sequel to Unholy Heights or GNOSIA, preferring to create something entirely new every time.
* **Indie Spirit:** Despite success and the anime deal with Aniplex, the team remains just four people based in Nagoya, prioritizing their creative freedom over scaling up.

**Producer TORUKAWA KATSU LONG INTERVIEW**  
**Toru Kawakatsu (Mezukare) – Representative of the GNOSIA Development Group**

From Nagoya to the world. A game created by just four people has achieved an anime adaptation and is currently continuing to expand its reach. That game is GNOSIA, a ""Werewolf"" social deduction drama meets Sci-Fi time loop adventure. How exactly did this title, which broadened the possibilities of indie games, come to be? We spoke with Toru Kawakatsu (Mezukare), the representative of the game development group Petit Depotto, about his roots, his journey, and the past, present, and future of Petit Depotto that led to this masterpiece.

**PROFILE**  
**Toru Kawakatsu**  
Goes by the handle ""Mezukare."" Representative of Petit Depotto. While developing games in Nagoya, he also serves as a lecturer and researcher at vocational schools and universities. During the late stages of development for Petit Depotto's first title, Unholy Heights (Maison de Maou), he reportedly used his earnings from teaching and other work to fund the activities of the other members (Shigoto, Kotori, and Q flavor). Petit Depotto released Unholy Heights in 2012 and GNOSIA in 2019. He serves as the producer for the TV anime GNOSIA, which began airing every Saturday starting October 11, 2025, and is also involved in the main content of the anime as the original creator.

**The Joy of Achieved ""What You Couldn't Do""**

**——Congratulations on the GNOSIA anime adaptation. How did you feel when Aniplex first approached you with the project?**

**Kawakatsu:** I was shocked. I honestly wondered if it was real. The email address ended in ""aniplex,"" so I instinctively searched for the sender's name online. I just thought, ""This can't be happening.""

**——""Can't be happening"" (laughs).**

**Kawakatsu:** Aniplex producer (Yoshitaka) Kimura-san actually came all the way to Nagoya. We talked there. I asked him, ""Do you understand what it means for a huge company like yours to partner with a tiny organization like ours?"" I didn't know the specific budget for an anime, but I knew it would be incredibly expensive, so I worried if they could actually recoup the costs. I had a lot of concerns. But Kimura-san spoke about the adaptation with such intensity. Actually, at the time, we had received offers for an anime adaptation from three different companies, including Aniplex. The representatives from each company were very passionate, but Aniplex was the first to email us, and they were the most enthusiastic.

**——Since GNOSIA is a game centered around a Werewolf-style system, it's primarily a conversation drama. I honestly wondered if it was even possible to animate.**

**Kawakatsu:** Right? (Laughs). You’d think it’s impossible. That’s exactly why we took on the challenge.

**——Oh, you did it** ***because*** **people thought it couldn't be done.**

**Kawakatsu:** When we first started making GNOSIA and announced it as a ""single-player Werewolf game,"" people told us constantly, ""There's no way you can make that."" When we exhibited the game while it was still in development, people from various game companies would ask, ""Are you actually going to finish this?"" Of course, some people praised it, too. Whenever I met people like that, I would ask them, ""If this gets finished, would you want to play it?"" They would say, ""I want to play it,"" or ""There aren't any other single-player Werewolf games, so I'd buy it."" That became my motivation. In other words, there was a possibility they would buy it if we finished it, and at the very least, if we achieved something they thought ""couldn't be done,"" they would be interested. With this anime, people also said it ""couldn't be done,"" right? It's the same thing. If the anime is ""done,"" it will surely be a unique work. People who know the game will be surprised, thinking, ""So this is how they adapted it,"" or ""This is what happens when it becomes an anime."" I thought that sense of surprise might make viewers feel like they are being swept up in the incident, sharing the same sentiment as the anime’s protagonist, **Yuri**.

**——Making the ""impossible"" possible—that seems to be the Kawakatsu style. I’d love to hear about your roots. What kind of games did you like as a child?**

**Kawakatsu:** When you're a kid, you get scolded if you just stay inside playing all the time. So, I would spend half my playtime on video games and the other half playing outside. But just playing normally at the park was boring, so I started mixing in different rules or modifying games like Kick the Can, Tag, or Red Light, Green Light (Daruma-san ga Koronda) to make them more fun. However, when evening came, we had to go home, so we didn't have much time. I had to figure out how to make the game fully enjoyable within a short 60 or 90-minute window. So, I used to tweak the rules to make that work.

**——You were creating games by changing rules within constraints.**

**Kawakatsu:** The group I played with back then was about six or seven kids. Looking back, I was already doing trial-and-error to improve things and make them interesting even then.

**——Kids are greedy for fun and harsh on anything boring, aren't they?**

**Kawakatsu:** Exactly. And changing the rules meant I had to take the position of organizing everything. So, I ended up leading a lot. That part of me might still be present today.

**A Childhood Dream—**  
**""I Want to Make Games""**

**——You are part of the so-called Famicom (NES) generation, correct?**

**Kawakatsu:** Oh, I am Famicom generation through and through.

**——When did you start liking video games or computer games?**

**Kawakatsu:** When I was in kindergarten, a relative took me to a coffee shop, and they had a tabletop Space Invaders cabinet. I was shocked that I could move the pictures on the screen. And it was fun. I'm originally from Nagoya, and later I found out there was a strategy called the ""Nagoya Attack"" (Nagoya Uchi), which made me feel a connection to it, so I got really hooked. But arcade games cost money, so I started playing the digital games I got as Christmas presents. Things like the Game & Watch double-panel ones—LSI games. I especially liked the LSI games that were shaped like arcade cabinets. I used to lend and borrow them with friends to play all sorts of games.

**——How about the Family Computer (Famicom)?**

**Kawakatsu:** It was amazing that Donkey Kong, which was in arcades, could be played at home. But I wasn't allowed to get a Famicom at the time, so I’d go to friends' houses who had one and play Mario Bros.

**——Did you own a computer?**

**Kawakatsu:** No. A friend from elementary school had what I think was a PC-8801, and he let me touch it. But in elementary school, I didn't understand programming at all. There was a magazine called BASIC MAGAZINE back then, but to my elementary school self, the code just looked like a ""Resurrection Spell"" (password from Dragon Quest). I didn't understand the meaning, and I didn't know English, so I had no idea what was happening. Rather than programming, I just messed around with the PC to play games with everyone. Later, I got an MSX2 and played like crazy at home.

**——Are there any Famicom titles that left an impression on you?**

**Kawakatsu:** Back then, the Famicom had a lot of action games. I admired Master Takahashi (Takahashi Meijin) and even went to the National Caravan events. I even bought a Shooting Watch (laughs). To be honest, I initially had a resistance to games where you just read text, like The Portopia Serial Murder Case or Dragon Quest. But when I actually played them, they were incredibly interesting. I realized RPGs were fun, and I got super addicted to Final Fantasy when it came out the following year.

**——Did you like arcade games?**

**Kawakatsu:** Around that time, there was a Namco (now Bandai Namco Entertainment) arcade in Nagoya called (Hoshigaoka) Carrot House. If you went there, they distributed a booklet called NG. I recall it featured comments from game developers. That’s how I learned about people like Masanobu Endo, who created The Tower of Druaga and Xevious. As I did that, I gradually became curious about the creators. Also, if you bought a pencil board at the shop, it had pixel art of the characters on it. I used that to copy the characters from The Tower of Druaga into my graph paper notebook. I also read game books. Like Steve Jackson's Kharé: Cityport of Traps.

**——So that's how your interest shifted toward the creators?**

**Kawakatsu:** Since kindergarten or elementary school, I absolutely wanted to become a game creator. In my elementary school graduation essay, I wrote ""Programmer"" because I thought, ""I want to make games"" (laughs).

**——So, did you get a job at a game company?**

**Kawakatsu:** Regarding job hunting... I wanted to join a game company at the time, but I didn't know how to get in. Back then, game companies didn't actively advertise recruitment. As far as I could research, lacking development skills, the only way in was through the arcades directly managed by game companies. So, I decided to join an arcade division and applied to all of them. Sega, Namco, Taito... I failed every single one.

**——I see...**

**Kawakatsu:** That made me painfully realize that I was ""nobody."" I had to step up, even if it meant changing industries. So, I looked for a company with a good environment and benefits—a company that, even if unknown to the public, had little competition, held patents, and monopolized a market. I figured that since students wouldn't apply to companies that didn't use brand recognition as a weapon, the competition would be low, and the pay would be high. When I looked for companies with that perspective, sure enough, I found one. So, I joined a machine tool manufacturer as a salesperson.

**——You placed yourself in a new environment, different from your childhood goal.**

**Kawakatsu:** I decided to work there for one year to test if I would forget my dream of ""making games."" If, after a year, I still thought ""I want to make games,"" then I would reconsider my career path.

**——Okay. And what happened after a year?**

**Kawakatsu:** I didn't have the courage to give up on my dream. I realized it in my bones. I still wanted to make games.

**——Even though you joined a good company!**

**Kawakatsu:** Working there, I felt the strength of a ""company that holds patents."" Since they offer services and technology others can't, they are extremely strong as a business. That’s exactly why the sales job was so difficult. We were delivering machine tools to factories, and if even one of the expected numerical values presented during the sale was wrong, it would be a disaster. The entire factory production line would stop, causing massive losses. The responsibility on the salesperson was huge. I was grateful to learn that. It was a very important experience I couldn't have learned anywhere else.

**——Still, you decided to pursue the path of games.**

**Kawakatsu:** Yes. Since I failed the first time, I thought I needed to properly acquire technical skills. Around the year 2000, game vocational schools started popping up everywhere. I decided to use the money I saved from working for a year to attend one. I thought about whether to stay at the company or go to vocational school until the very last minute. When I consulted my branch manager around January or February, he was surprised.

**——I'm sure he didn't see that coming. what kind of school was it?**

**Kawakatsu:** That school was extremely strict; you had to make an entire game by yourself. Graphics, programming, music—everything alone. The PC specs were super low, and we saved data on floppy disks. They made us do everything from scratch using Assembler, from wireframes to texture display.

**——That sounds incredibly spartan.**

**Kawakatsu:** It really was. It was a two-year program, but a significant number of students dropped out halfway through. People like me, who had quit jobs to come to school and couldn't turn back, would stay late after class constantly making games. I still keep in touch with those people today.

**——You became stronger because you had experienced a setback.**

**Kawakatsu:** I really think it's important to face the fact that ""you are nobody"" when you are young. You have no title, no skills, so when asked ""What do you do?"", you can't answer. It makes you feel lost and anxious. But it is better to thoroughly taste that state of being.

**Confronting the Reality That Any Company Will Eventually Disappear**

**——Where did you apply for jobs after that?**

**Kawakatsu:** I joined T&E SOFT.

**——T&E SOFT? That is one of the most legendary companies in the PC game industry!**

**Kawakatsu:** Exactly. In the early days of PC gaming, there was an era where people said, ""Nihon Falcom in the East, T&E SOFT in the West."" I used to watch Akira Yamashita's segment on the TV show Pasokon Sunday, so I knew them as a Nagoya-based game company. Around the time I joined, they were doing things like releasing a 3D golf game using the engine from Haruka Naru Augusta.

**——You joined the machine tool company as a salesperson, but what was your role when you joined T&E SOFT?**

**Kawakatsu:** Programmer.

**——Is that so!**

**Kawakatsu:** Actually, I had already received a job offer from a different game company. Even my vocational school teacher thought I would go there. But the deadline to accept that offer was the day before my final interview with T&E SOFT. T&E SOFT was a company I had admired since I was little, and I knew I would regret it if I gave up on them. So, I turned down the other company and went to the final interview at T&E SOFT. Then, on the very day of that final interview, I got a call saying, ""We want you to come in immediately.""

**——So your dream came true.**

**Kawakatsu:** Well, while I was happy, I also thought it was a little strange. Even for a final interview, getting a call immediately on the same day seemed too fast, didn't it?

**——I see...**

**Kawakatsu:** When I went to the company, there were already four teams—A, B, C, and D—and I was assigned to Team C as a programmer. But when I got there, I found only planners and designers; development hadn't progressed at all. Yet, the situation was such that we had to submit a game for an internal review in two months. There was no program, the plans weren't concrete, and the characters weren't animated. On top of that, there were various mini-game-like elements. I thought, ""Ah, we're not going to make it."" It was quite a tough situation.

**——Suddenly playing on Hard Mode.**

**Kawakatsu:** I had no choice, so I called the leader of Group C. I told him, ""I know I'm a rookie, but forgive my bluntness: this is absolutely not going to finish."" I said, ""You can blame me if you want, but all the work is concentrated on the programmers."" Then I proposed, ""If we're going to make the deadline..."" and I set up role divisions for the staff and took charge of organizing it. The leader accepted my proposal. Thanks to that, we somehow managed to make it in time.

**——A rookie, yet immediately shouldering heavy responsibility.**

**Kawakatsu:** I realized that whether you are a senior, a rookie, or in a different role, if you can all move toward a single goal, you can create something.

**——That was a major step forward for you as a game creator.**

**Kawakatsu:** It was. However, at the same time, I was made painfully aware that there were people out there who were far more amazing programmers than I was. When I asked questions to senior programmers on other teams, the answers I got were just too incredible. To the point where I couldn't even understand the meaning. T&E SOFT truly had many geniuses. Being in that environment, while I felt the satisfaction of completing a title, I was also forced to recognize my own lack of ability.

**——Was the game you worked on released?**

**Kawakatsu:** I don't think it was ever released.

**——I see.**

**Kawakatsu:** You know, when you're inside a company, you start to understand things gradually. You sense the atmosphere of a company where things aren't going well. Despite having excellent people, things just weren't taking shape... So, eventually, I left the company as well. By the way, Q flavor, who handles sound for Petit Depotto, joined T&E SOFT at the same time as I did.

**——A Petit Depotto member!**

**Kawakatsu:** Though, it would still be a long time before we started activities as Petit Depotto (laughs). However, what we understood when we left T&E SOFT was that ""companies will disappear someday."" The idea that a company won't go under, or that you're safe because you're a salaried employee—those thoughts vanished. I realized I had to maintain a sense of crisis, knowing that companies in the entertainment business are precarious. We are partnering with Aniplex for the GNOSIA anime adaptation now, but you never know what the future holds. That's why I try to approach my work cherishing every encounter and job as something precious.

**Days of Ceaseless Game Making**

**——Did you continue working in games after leaving your first game company?**

**Kawakatsu:** I got a job at a game company specifically because I wanted to make games, so I couldn't just back down. Around that time, there was a major shift. Mobile phones came onto the scene. Mobile carriers, starting with NTT Docomo, began announcing that games could be made with Java. There was an IT company trying to enter that market, so I joined them. It was pretty much right at the launch of that business.

**——The mobile game industry.**

**Kawakatsu:** Yes. In the early days, the games were small in scale but very experimental. It felt similar to the state of things when the Famicom first came out and all sorts of games were popping up. I started gathering staff and making games from the position of a planner. I even reached out to the friends I had worked hard with back in vocational school. We made game after game. As we did, mobile phone specs kept powering up, and we started getting development requests from various game companies. Mainly offers to port Famicom-era games. A particularly big turning point was when NTT Docomo launched FOMA, and Square Enix announced they were entering the market with Dragon Quest I and Final Fantasy I. The attitude of game companies changed at that moment. Everyone started entering the mobile market all at once. We started getting even more requests for ports.

**——So you ended up porting the games you used to play.**

**Kawakatsu:** The pinch was that when porting, we had absolutely no development materials from the past. No specification documents, no old code, no data. We had to ""eye-copy"" everything. We'd watch the game, analyze it, and recreate the behavior exactly as we saw it. We bought every magazine and strategy guide from back then and thoroughly researched information online. The data capacity for mobile phones was limited, so we had to reproduce it as best we could within those limits. Analyzing various games like that taught me a lot. We also had offers to release original new titles every month. About one month from debugging to going gold, doing over 12 titles a year—that allowed us to run a lot of experiments.

**——What titles left an impression on you?**

**Kawakatsu:** A game called Jaseiken Necromancer: NIGHTMARE REBORN. My name is in the credits for that one. That was fun. When I looked at the music credits, I saw Yuzo Koshiro's name. I thought, ""Isn't this the Yuzo Koshiro from Ys?!"" It was a moment where I felt indirectly connected to the games I played in the past and the creators who made them.

**——Did you meet Shigoto (development) and Kotori (graphics) around this time?**

**Kawakatsu:** Regarding Shigoto-kun, while we were making games at that IT company, we were short-handed, so we put out a job listing, and he came in as a part-timer. He was still a university student at the time. Our first meeting was intense, too—he had blond hair, wore red clothes, trousers, and setta sandals. I thought, ""This guy's a bit scary"" (laughs).

**——Did Shigoto have experience making games?**

**Kawakatsu:** He might have done it as a hobby, but I think he started for real after joining the company. He was originally hired as a part-timer in the IT department of the same company. I heard he liked games, so we talked, and it turned out we liked similar PC games. More than anything, he was very personable. Because of that, I started asking him to help out the game department here and there, having him write up proposal documents, and our points of contact increased.

**To Obtain What I Was Missing:**  
**The Birth of Petit Depotto**

**——Was that around the time you started making games seriously with Shigoto?**

**Kawakatsu:** No, we only did about two or three titles together then. We made app games. One day, we were chatting, and the topic came up that doujin games at Comiket looked interesting, so we decided to try experiencing it once. When we needed a designer, Shigoto-kun brought in Kotori-chan, who was at the same university.

**——So you met through doujin activities.**

**Kawakatsu:** Yes. We started it as a hobby. At the time, I was making games for mobile phones, which meant selling digital data. I had no experience selling games via CDs or physical packages. I wanted to try making a package and selling CD-ROMs ourselves just once. So, we tried making a kinematic novel-style adventure game.

**——So that was effectively Petit Depotto's first title. How was it exhibiting at Comic Market?**

**Kawakatsu:** When we went to Comic Market, the game circle area was incredibly hype about TYPE-MOON. Furthermore, Ryukishi07's circle (07th Expansion) was debuting at the exact same time as us. Ryukishi07 was exhibiting at the table right behind us.

**——What an incredible time.**

**Kawakatsu:** At that time, Ryukishi07 was distributing the ""Onikakushi-hen"" of Higurashi When They Cry. Even though we had worked hard to make ours, people were flocking to Higurashi. There was a huge line at TYPE-MOON, too. I witnessed people who were likely around my age appearing dashingly and achieving massive success right before my eyes.

**——Both are creators who are still very active today.**

**Kawakatsu:** TYPE-MOON, Ryukishi07... they were all passing right by me. Later on, Daisuke Yamamoto, whom I knew at the time, made Puzzle & Dragons a massive breakout hit at GungHo (Online Entertainment). I felt I had been working hard in the industry, but something was missing in me. Around that time, Director Hideo Kojima, who created Metal Gear Solid, said in a magazine interview that ""many game creators make their hit titles in their early 30s."" Since I was turning 30 and coming into my prime age-wise, I wondered, ""Isn't that time coming for me, too?""

**——And so... you went independent?**

**Kawakatsu:** By that time, I had been working at that company for about 10 years and was a department manager. I had about 40 staff members, and the way we worked had changed from the early days. Management work was interesting, but that was exactly when smartphones appeared. iPhone, Android. With their arrival, everyone in the world started making apps all at once. People began creating apps individually—what were called ""wild apps"" (nora-puri).

**——The iPhone Shock.**

**Kawakatsu:** With NTT Docomo's FOMA, you couldn't release a game unless you had a contract as a company. So, ordinary people couldn't make games. But with iPhone and Android, it became a situation where anyone in the world could make apps, and free games were popping up everywhere. Apps were coming out from all over the world regardless of whether they sold or not. Honestly, thinking I had to compete with that seemed pretty exhausting. Around that time, there was a movement where the Xbox 360 opened its doors to indies (Xbox LIVE Indie Games). I knew that Shigoto-kun and the others had already left the company and were working on app games as freelancers, so I decided to quit the company later and join them after a while. They were companions I had worked with at Comiket and the office, after all. Also, I left the company on good terms, so I still get along with them today.

**——So Petit Depotto started in earnest.**

**Kawakatsu:** Right around that time, the Lehman Shock (the 2008 financial crisis) happened, and the economy was in a recession. Shigoto-kun had a part-time job collecting rent. He would go around to houses holding letters demanding rent, but it didn't go well. I even went with him once, holding those ominous papers, to demand payment. From that experience, the game about collecting rent, Maison de Maou (Unholy Heights), was born.

**——Where did the production costs for the first title come from?**

**Kawakatsu:** The development costs for Maison de Maou came from our living expenses. Everyone was working side jobs, so we used money from that for production. When that wasn't enough, I would lend money to the members. Of course, I've collected it all back now (laughs).

**——Maison de Maou was first released on Xbox 360, then the Windows version the next year, and the Nintendo 3DS version the year after that. You expanded to multiple platforms rapidly. That must have been rare at the time...**

**Kawakatsu:** It was. My initial goal was to make it a multi-platform title originating from the indie scene. At the time, almost no one in the indie space was doing that. I thought that was the weakness of indies. But since I had experience producing at a game company, I figured if I used my experience to the fullest, I could produce a multi-platform release.

**——That's great!**

**Kawakatsu:** In the indie world back then, everyone started with the desire to make a game, but it seemed like they stopped there. I thought that was a waste. I felt it was important to think about promotion and multi-platform expansion as well. So, with the help of Mebius, a game development and sales company I had known for a long time, we rolled it out all at once.

**——Maison de Maou became a smash hit, expanding to multiple platforms and even getting a novel adaptation. Did you ever consider making a sequel, like Maison de Maou 2?**

**Kawakatsu:** No, not at all. To begin with, Petit Depotto isn't a team that wants to make tons of games. We might get bored if we kept making the same thing. The desire to make something new is much stronger.

**——You want to create new things.**

**Kawakatsu:** Also, I didn't want us to be colored by Maison de Maou. I didn't think it would be good if people thought of Petit Depotto as ""that team that makes cute but toxic games."" I wanted people to look forward to whatever new game Petit Depotto would make. In that sense, our second title, GNOSIA, ended up being a completely different genre with a totally different visual touch.

**Narrating Through the System:**  
**The Narrative of GNOSIA**

**——You've spoken about GNOSIA in various interviews, but I hear the idea originally came from Shigoto-kun's dissatisfaction with computer ""Werewolf games.""**

**Kawakatsu:** Online games are popular right now, but I think there are quite a few people who want to play games alone. They might be from the Famicom generation like us, or they might just like stoic games. I thought there was a certain number of people who play alone at their own pace, so I wanted to propose a ""single-player Werewolf game"" for them. More than anything, we wanted to play it. If the game you want to play exists in the world, you can just buy it, but if it doesn't exist, you have no choice but to make it yourself. That was the motivation.

**——So it was a game you made for yourselves. Playing GNOSIA, it's interesting not just as a game, but because it has a somewhat nostalgic atmosphere. It uses generic text cleverly to create diverse stories, and you repeat the roughly 10-minute Werewolf game over and over. It feels like a game built on ideas despite the limited data volume...**

**Kawakatsu:** I see. This might be slightly off-topic, but we pride ourselves on the fact that the games we make are games that only the four members of Petit Depotto could make. We aim to make the most interesting game possible within what our four members can create.

**——I see. So you aren't aiming for a super high-end game.**

**Kawakatsu:** To put it paradoxically, it's about how interesting a game we can make with how limited resources there is. This is similar to when I used to make games in Java long ago. We play various games and research the mechanisms of high-end games, thinking about what makes them fun. Based on that, we decide to make a game that is something we can build.

**——Were there any games you referenced or researched while making GNOSIA?**

**Kawakatsu:** A game called Zill O'll. Our members like it; we thought having that kind of freedom would be good. Also, the system of changing parameters to obtain skills was referenced from Dark Souls and the like.

**——Zill O'll is a ""free scenario"" RPG. It was a game where the scenario changed according to the player's choices.**

**Kawakatsu:** GNOSIA was initially being made as a casual, single-player discussion game. When we decided to turn it into a full-fledged game halfway through, we realized we needed to bring out the charm of the characters and create a story, so we kept adding more and more. The ""Werewolf"" system is actually a great mechanism for drawing out the charm of characters.

**——That's true! ""Werewolf"" is a game that brings out the individuality of each participant. That's why things like The Werewolf: Live Playing Theatre exist.**

**Kawakatsu:** Exactly. We kept adding those elements by playing the developing version of GNOSIA over and over again. So, we didn't have a clear, grand goal decided for GNOSIA from the start.

**——The game kept changing as you played it.**

**Kawakatsu:** It's interesting—when you play dozens of times with AI that has tweaked parameters, the personality of that AI starts to look real. We built the characters to match the personalities that emerged from that process.

**——In GNOSIA, there are 14 characters besides the protagonist (the player). Are you saying they weren't created from settings, but were born from the behavior of computer algorithms?**

**Kawakatsu:** That's right. We did repeated test plays, and based on the impressions we got from the characters we experienced, we thought up the scenarios and settings retroactively. That's why the affinity between the characters' thinking during the Werewolf game and the scenario should be very high.

**——That's interesting. So the 14 people in GNOSIA are characters born from the game itself.**

**Kawakatsu:** Yes. It's like imagining things based on the behaviors the computer spits out. We fleshed them out from there. Our designer, Kotori, didn't just design the characters visually; she also provided a lot of character ideas, and we boiled down the characters together with Shigoto-kun. I think GNOSIA contains a lot of the personalities of our four members.

**——So in fleshing out the characters, the unique individuality of the four of you is embedded in them.**

**Kawakatsu:** Yes. We've played it thousands of times, so I think we understand well how the players will feel. If a character's behavior was annoying or caused stress to the player, we fixed it. If anything bothered us, we corrected it and adjusted it thoroughly, so I think it's become very comfortable to play.

**——What deepens the flavor of the characters is the looping. Because the protagonist loops, the memories of everyone other than the protagonist and Setsu are reset, and you meet them in a blank state. But the player remembers the events with each character, which creates a sense of heartache and sadness.**

**Kawakatsu:** For example, to implement the feeling of ""I'm meeting this character for the first time, but it doesn't feel like the first time"" into the system, we set invisible parameters for each character. One of these invisible values doesn't get reset when you loop. As you interact with characters and loop repeatedly, that value accumulates. That way, even if the protagonist loops, not everything is reset; the relationship with the character continues.

**——The relationships with characters connected by that kind of system are interesting.**

**Kawakatsu:** I think it's important not just to tell the story with words, but to ""narrate through the system."" This isn't a novel; it's a game. I find games where the story and system are fused to be interesting, so I'd be happy if people can feel that in GNOSIA.

**——Which character is your favorite, Kawakatsu-san?**

**Kawakatsu:** Let's see. I like **Raqio**, and I like **Yuriko**, too. Our designer Kotori likes **Chipie** and **Sha-Ming**, and Shigoto-kun likes **Gina** way too much. If you were playing Werewolf with a large group, what kind of people would make it fun? If everyone was good at it, it would be boring. And fundamentally, based on the setting, the characters in GNOSIA didn't gather because they wanted to play Werewolf, anyway.

**Visualizing a Game That Is Impossible to Visualize**

**——For this anime adaptation, I assume you are visualizing elements based on GNOSIA settings that haven't been made public yet. In that sense, what is the positioning of the TV anime version for you, Kawakatsu-san?**

**Kawakatsu:** First of all, the original game GNOSIA is already complete. To put it simply, if we were to depict things with a higher ""resolution"" (level of detail) than what is in the game, it would become a story from a different timeline than the game version. So, the anime is positioned as a different timeline—a new world that is an expansion of the game. For those who have played the game, imagine it as ""taking a peek into someone else's GNOSIA world."" Of course, I am supervising the anime version, and I’ve had thorough discussions with the anime staff regarding the settings of GNOSIA. They are visualizing parts that weren't depicted in the game, so it offers a new kind of GNOSIA fun from a different world line. You could call it a collaborative work with the creators involved in the anime.

**——You are participating as a producer, so I imagine you were able to offer various opinions to the anime staff, and they likely had many questions for you. What kind of distance did you maintain during this process?**

**Kawakatsu:** I view the anime version as one of many possibilities. If I kept saying ""Don't do that"" or ""This is wrong,"" the production team would feel stifled, wouldn't they? From my experience being involved in various game development sites, if the original creator is too strict, the people working on it feel suffocated, and things eventually stop going well. I’ve been in situations making games where I thought, ""It would be so fun if we did this!"" but was never able to do it. I decided that if I ever became the original creator, I would stop restricting the production site like that. I would be happy if fans of the game cherish the completed game world, while for the anime version, we considered the best form to reach new viewers by expanding the Gnosia universe—its expressions and settings—so they can watch a new world within it.

**——I’m sure there were many elements where people around you pointed out, as you mentioned earlier, that ""animating GNOSIA is impossible."" How did you overcome those challenges?**

**Kawakatsu:** Well... that is something we have been discussing ever since I first met Aniplex's Kimura-san four years ago. I was well aware of the parts of GNOSIA that ""aren't suited for visualization,"" and we thought long and hard about how to land it successfully. To break through those difficult parts, we brought in (Jukki) Hanada-san (Series Composition/Script) and had discussions with Director (Ryo-timo) Ichikawa. Through that process, I think we arrived at a goal that only anime could achieve. I would be happy if viewers also pay attention to and enjoy ""how they visualized things that were unimaginable as animation.""

**——Since most of the generic text (dialogue) from the game version had to be carefully rewritten to match the characters' situations and personalities in the anime, the different approaches between the game and anime are very fun.**

**Kawakatsu:** If you think about it normally, the debate scenes in a ""Werewolf game"" should be interesting conversations, right? Since the cast members are acting them out in the anime version, we wanted to bring out the fun of the bargaining and tactics even more. Also, we wanted you to see the interior of the spaceship. Realizing those expressions that expanded from the game into anime required a massive amount of energy, but Kimura-san from Aniplex, scriptwriter Hanada-san, and Director Ichikawa all worked incredibly hard to make it happen.

**——So the anime version of GNOSIA has become** ***another GNOSIA*** **for you as well.**

**Kawakatsu:** We are making the anime version with a huge company like Aniplex, but Aniplex really respected the fact that it is an ""indie game."" They clarified the production team and the anime's concept, and when the adaptation was announced, the reaction on social media was very positive, which made me happy. Thanks to that, I think the anime GNOSIA has turned out to be something that contains an indie soul.

**Making the Games We Want to Play Ourselves**

**——It has been over 10 years since you started working on indie games. How do you see the current indie scene?**

**Kawakatsu:** I feel like the indie world is becoming largely commercialized... I originally thought of ""indie"" as something that emerged as a counter-culture to commercial activities and commercial works. There are goals other than just commercial success—whether it's money, fame, or simply a means of expression. It’s enough just to make something you think is interesting and have a moment of excitement with the users who like it. If I recall, Among Us was made by three people (Innersloth), right? And Tetris was one or two people (Alexey Pajitnov, etc.), wasn't it? Increasing scale and spending money is important, but before that, I think it's about returning to the initial creative impulse.

**——So it's important not to lose that initial impulse.**

**Kawakatsu:** That's right. Rather than the impulse to ""make games,"" we have a stronger mindset of ""making the games we want to play ourselves.""

**——By the way, Petit Depotto is based in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture. Do you have any thoughts of moving from Nagoya?**

**Kawakatsu:** No, I don't. I like my hometown, and it's a comfortable place to live. Also, I teach at a vocational school and a university in Nagoya. I want the students there to feel that ""you can do it even in Nagoya."" Of course, it's fine to go from Nagoya to the big city and succeed, too. In short, you don't need the preconceived notion that ""it has to be this way.""

**——What are the good points of Nagoya for you?**

**Kawakatsu:** It has everything you need for daily life and in terms of city scale, and since the shops are concentrated in specific areas, you don't have to worry about where to go. My impression is that there aren't many game companies or game creators there yet, so I think there is fertile soil for things to get exciting from here on out.

**——So, Petit Depotto's debut work was Unholy Heights (Maison de Maou), and the second was GNOSIA. What is the status of the development for the next... the third title?**

**Kawakatsu:** It is still in the concept phase.

**——Since the color of the first and second titles were quite different, I wonder what the third will be like. I feel like we, along with other Petit Depotto fans, might realize with the third title, ""Ah, this is the essence of Petit Depotto."" Sorry for the presumption...**

**Kawakatsu:** That makes me happy. You mean you'll understand our unique flavor, right?

**——Yes. The game genres are different every time, but I feel like we will recognize that specific taste that comes from a Petit Depotto creation.**

**Kawakatsu:** We do want to make something new every time.

**——Various changes are happening in the game industry, but...**

**Kawakatsu:** We won't change. I think the four of us will continue to enjoy making games together in the future.",3,1767276047.0,Gnosia_,0,1.0,False

Booked our stay through Amex Travel as the hotel is part of FHR. Upgrade was shown on app few days before our arrival day, and Concierge reached out, to ask for preferences, a week prior. Got upgraded (also shown in app), either because of FHR booking, or Hilton Gold status. Originally booked ‘Double Premier room’ and the upgrade gave us ‘King Premier room with Spa Facilities’.

The front desk to check-in is kind of in its own room, and not in a big open space, as one would expect. Concierge was located right next to the front desk. Macarons and water was offered upon arrival. The receptionist had printed out our benefits with FHR, and kindly showed us around the lobby, and then also gave a tour of our room.

The room was extremely nice, and just high quality. We had some sweets and a greeting card waiting for us. The room had some nice lobby music playing. There was two iPads to control basically everything in the room, like TVs, AC, lights, blinds and even music. The bathroom featured a bathtub and also our private steam room.

Breakfast is included with the FHR rate, but also with Gold status. Pastries, fruit and cold cuts were offered buffet style, and hot options were made to order. Drinks were also served to the table. Service was absolutely on point, and everyone seemed to really enjoy what they’re doing!

As for the FHR $100 credit, the hotel converts it to 85€, which cannot be used towards minibar, tips and other stuff they sell etc. We decided to order burgers in the room, and they were superb! 🍔",13,1767276009.0,Hilton,1,1.0,False

First three attempts completely failed, lost about $9K total between them and wasted probably 18 months of nights and weekends. Fourth attempt is working though, been running it for 16 months and currently making $6.8K monthly as the only person. First attempt was a task management app I built because I personally wanted it. Spent 5 months coding, launched it, got maybe 30 users total, zero revenue. Second was a Chrome extension for managing tabs, similar story. Third was a freelance marketplace specifically for designers, spent $3K on development, could never get enough supply or demand to make it work. Pattern was always the same, I built what I thought was cool without checking if anyone actually had that problem.

Fourth attempt started completely differently. I'm a content marketer at a SaaS company and kept hearing our sales team complain about tracking conversations across email, Slack, and LinkedIn. They'd lose context about prospects, forget what was discussed, waste time searching old messages. I asked 8 sales people at different companies if they had the same issue over coffee chats, 6 said yes and described almost identical problems. One was paying $80/month per person for a CRM they barely used just to track conversations.

Built the simplest possible version in 3 weeks, just a Chrome extension that captures conversations from different tools and organizes them by contact. Showed it to those 6 people, 3 started using it immediately. Asked if they'd pay $25/month, two said yes, one said maybe $20. Set up Stripe, got my first $45 MRR in week 4. That felt more real than anything from my previous three products. Growth was slow but steady. Posted in sales communities on Reddit and LinkedIn just helping people with conversation tracking problems, mentioned my tool when relevant. Hit $800/month by month 4, $1.9K by month 8. Started writing blog posts about sales productivity in month 6, took until month 10 before those started bringing organic signups. Now at month 16 making $6.8K with 289 paying users, working maybe 10-12 hours per week on support and small updates.

The shift wasn't learning better technical skills, it was building something people were already complaining about instead of what I thought they might need.

# The beginning of the past

Dear diary

In my previous life, I was once loved by my family. Even though my twin sister ‘Ava’ was the favorite, I was satisfied with it as long as I had them by my side.

Then my sister went missing and that was all for me. The pain of losing my sister still lingered, my parents, once full of love and warmth, became cold and distant. They were consumed by grief and guilt and I was left to pick up the pieces of a shattered family.

I could remember the day my sister went missing like it was yesterday. My mom had wanted me to go get her something at the store but found me in the toilet defecating. Having no choice as she needed it urgently, she sent my twin sister instead and that was the last we heard of her in a long time. The whole community searched for her everywhere, calling out her name, but there was no response. I was left alone, scared, and confused on how she had suddenly vanished.

As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, we all began to lose hope. They became withdrawn towards me and I was left to fend for myself. I felt like I was losing not only my sister but also my family.

I tried to fill the void by being the perfect child, by being obedient and quiet, but it didn’t matter. My family’s love and attention were focused on finding my sister, and I was left in the shadows.

As time went on, my mother put the blame on me, not directly but with her actions. Then she came out directly, telling me how she wished I was the one missing instead. She had cried and begged the gods to take me instead and bring back my sister right in my presence while forcing me to pray along with her.

Four years later, part of her prayer was answered as the cops found my sister ‘Ava’. Her abductors were found and arrested. It was a day of joy in my house. My mum had fainted out of joy and my father’s grin did not leave his lips as he stared affectionately at her.

When I caught Ava kissing with my boyfriend and shouted at them, I was slapped by my mom. She told me I was being selfish and should call Ava my hero as she saved me from being abducted. My boyfriend ‘Jack’ had broken up with me to be with my ‘perfect’ beautiful sister saying I wasn’t pretty enough.

My name is Avery Flynn, I have long curly brown hair that cascades down my back like a rich, chocolate waterfall. My bright hazel eyes are fringed with thick lashes that add to their allures. My skin is a smooth, creamy complexion with a subtle golden tinted glow, a testament to my love for the outdoors. My features can be called delicate yet defined, with high cheekbones and a small, button nose. I have a petite athletic build. I could say I look more like my paternal grandmother than my mother, unlike my sister who looks exactly like her with a porcelain doll-like complexion and a curtain of silky blonde hair that falls down her back like a river of gold. Her eyes are a deep, piercing blue. Her features are finely chiseled, with a small, pointed chin and a nose that is slightly upturned, giving her a perpetually cheerful look. She has a slender, elegant build, with a quiet confidence that commands attention.

I know I look very pretty but I don’t think I will ever live out of her shadow.

On our eighteenth birthday party, my sister flocked around with my newest boyfriend, her hands around him while he wrapped his hands around her tiny waist. “What a perfect match they are” I had snickered.

This had been her usual thing since she took Jack from me. When she found out I had another boyfriend, she dumped Jack and snatched him from me. At first, it was painful at how fast she got them to leave me and date her just to prove that she was better than me but then, I started dating them now for fun.

# The beginning of the past

Dear diary

In my previous life, I was once loved by my family. Even though my twin sister ‘Ava’ was the favorite, I was satisfied with it as long as I had them by my side.

Then my sister went missing and that was all for me. The pain of losing my sister still lingered, my parents, once full of love and warmth, became cold and distant. They were consumed by grief and guilt and I was left to pick up the pieces of a shattered family.

I could remember the day my sister went missing like it was yesterday. My mom had wanted me to go get her something at the store but found me in the toilet defecating. Having no choice as she needed it urgently, she sent my twin sister instead and that was the last we heard of her in a long time. The whole community searched for her everywhere, calling out her name, but there was no response. I was left alone, scared, and confused on how she had suddenly vanished.

As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, we all began to lose hope. They became withdrawn towards me and I was left to fend for myself. I felt like I was losing not only my sister but also my family.

I tried to fill the void by being the perfect child, by being obedient and quiet, but it didn’t matter. My family’s love and attention were focused on finding my sister, and I was left in the shadows.

As time went on, my mother put the blame on me, not directly but with her actions. Then she came out directly, telling me how she wished I was the one missing instead. She had cried and begged the gods to take me instead and bring back my sister right in my presence while forcing me to pray along with her.

Four years later, part of her prayer was answered as the cops found my sister ‘Ava’. Her abductors were found and arrested. It was a day of joy in my house. My mum had fainted out of joy and my father’s grin did not leave his lips as he stared affectionately at her.

When I caught Ava kissing with my boyfriend and shouted at them, I was slapped by my mom. She told me I was being selfish and should call Ava my hero as she saved me from being abducted. My boyfriend ‘Jack’ had broken up with me to be with my ‘perfect’ beautiful sister saying I wasn’t pretty enough.

My name is Avery Flynn, I have long curly brown hair that cascades down my back like a rich, chocolate waterfall. My bright hazel eyes are fringed with thick lashes that add to their allures. My skin is a smooth, creamy complexion with a subtle golden tinted glow, a testament to my love for the outdoors. My features can be called delicate yet defined, with high cheekbones and a small, button nose. I have a petite athletic build. I could say I look more like my paternal grandmother than my mother, unlike my sister who looks exactly like her with a porcelain doll-like complexion and a curtain of silky blonde hair that falls down her back like a river of gold. Her eyes are a deep, piercing blue. Her features are finely chiseled, with a small, pointed chin and a nose that is slightly upturned, giving her a perpetually cheerful look. She has a slender, elegant build, with a quiet confidence that commands attention.

I know I look very pretty but I don’t think I will ever live out of her shadow.

On our eighteenth birthday party, my sister flocked around with my newest boyfriend, her hands around him while he wrapped his hands around her tiny waist. “What a perfect match they are” I had snickered.

This had been her usual thing since she took Jack from me. When she found out I had another boyfriend, she dumped Jack and snatched him from me. At first, it was painful at how fast she got them to leave me and date her just to prove that she was better than me but then, I started dating them now for fun. Her newest dummy was my ninth boyfriend in the span of two years and I happily passed her this vomit of mine since he’s as dumb as she is. Not to brag but I am the best student in my class and …she’s just the opposite of me.

# The beginning of the past

Dear diary

In my previous life, I was once loved by my family. Even though my twin sister ‘Ava’ was the favorite, I was satisfied with it as long as I had them by my side.

Then my sister went missing and that was all for me. The pain of losing my sister still lingered, my parents, once full of love and warmth, became cold and distant. They were consumed by grief and guilt and I was left to pick up the pieces of a shattered family.

I could remember the day my sister went missing like it was yesterday. My mom had wanted me to go get her something at the store but found me in the toilet defecating. Having no choice as she needed it urgently, she sent my twin sister instead and that was the last we heard of her in a long time. The whole community searched for her everywhere, calling out her name, but there was no response. I was left alone, scared, and confused on how she had suddenly vanished.

As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, we all began to lose hope. They became withdrawn towards me and I was left to fend for myself. I felt like I was losing not only my sister but also my family.

I tried to fill the void by being the perfect child, by being obedient and quiet, but it didn’t matter. My family’s love and attention were focused on finding my sister, and I was left in the shadows.

As time went on, my mother put the blame on me, not directly but with her actions. Then she came out directly, telling me how she wished I was the one missing instead. She had cried and begged the gods to take me instead and bring back my sister right in my presence while forcing me to pray along with her.

Four years later, part of her prayer was answered as the cops found my sister ‘Ava’. Her abductors were found and arrested. It was a day of joy in my house. My mum had fainted out of joy and my father’s grin did not leave his lips as he stared affectionately at her.

When I caught Ava kissing with my boyfriend and shouted at them, I was slapped by my mom. She told me I was being selfish and should call Ava my hero as she saved me from being abducted. My boyfriend ‘Jack’ had broken up with me to be with my ‘perfect’ beautiful sister saying I wasn’t pretty enough.

My name is Avery Flynn, I have long curly brown hair that cascades down my back like a rich, chocolate waterfall. My bright hazel eyes are fringed with thick lashes that add to their allures. My skin is a smooth, creamy complexion with a subtle golden tinted glow, a testament to my love for the outdoors. My features can be called delicate yet defined, with high cheekbones and a small, button nose. I have a petite athletic build. I could say I look more like my paternal grandmother than my mother, unlike my sister who looks exactly like her with a porcelain doll-like complexion and a curtain of silky blonde hair that falls down her back like a river of gold. Her eyes are a deep, piercing blue. Her features are finely chiseled, with a small, pointed chin and a nose that is slightly upturned, giving her a perpetually cheerful look. She has a slender, elegant build, with a quiet confidence that commands attention.

I know I look very pretty but I don’t think I will ever live out of her shadow.

On our eighteenth birthday party, my sister flocked around with my newest boyfriend, her hands around him while he wrapped his hands around her tiny waist. “What a perfect match they are” I had snickered.

This had been her usual thing since she took Jack from me. When she found out I had another boyfriend, she dumped Jack and snatched him from me. At first, it was painful at how fast she got them to leave me and date her just to prove that she was better than me but then, I started dating them now for fun. Her newest dummy was my ninth boyfriend in the span of two years and I happily passed her this vomit of mine since he’s as dumb as she is. Not to brag but I am the best student in my class and …she’s just the opposite of me.

The party was soon stopped when Ava fell down and lost consciousness. She was rushed to the hospital and was treated on quickly while we waited at the receptionist area. The sorry look on the doctor’s face made me feel uncomfortable as he directed my parents to his office.

I nervously sat down and watched as they walked away, I could hear my heart beating faster than normal at this new situation. I was still in my party clothes and was barefoot.

As I sat there, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of unease wash over me. The receptionist area, which was once filled with the sound of beeping machines and muted conversations, now seemed eerily quiet. I fidgeted with my fingernails, my eyes fixed on the door that my parents had just walked through with the doctor.

I tried to distract myself by looking around the room, taking in the sterile smell and the faded magazines on the coffee table. But my mind kept wandering back to Ava, wondering what was happening to her and why the doctor’s expression had looked so grave.

No matter how much trouble Ava had caused me, she was still my baby sister.

As the seconds ticked by followed by the minutes, I felt my anxiety grow. I stood up and walked over to the window, staring out into the parking lot. The hospital parking lot was dimly lit as the sun set shone down on it, with only a few cars scattered about.

December was my first month of treatment. During the first half, I took it at 10 AM, but I realized it was better to take it with a heavy meal, so I switched to taking it at 12:30/13 PM.

So on December 30th I couldn't sleep, I closed my eyes and tossed and turned all night, but sleep still wouldn't come. 

On the 31st I also couldn't sleep, but I don't know if it was because of the fireworks and loud music from my neighbors, but I think it's insomnia; I used to be able to sleep even on holidays. 

I spend the night in bed and feel like I've been taking coffee all night; I don't feel tired, but I know I haven't slept at all. 

I researched this and I think it might be because of the change in the time I take it, so I went back to taking Accutane in the morning today.

If anyone else has had insomnia, were you able to resolve it? I don't want to stop treatment because it's going very well so far, and acne ruined my adolescence.

 I hope my sleep will return to normal :(",1,1767274804.0,Accutane,1,1.0,False

1q14dm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1q14dm0/custody_after_suicide_threats/,Custody After Suicide Threats,"Tuesday evening I told my STBXH (33) that I (33F) want a divorce. He was extremely angry and stormed out of the house shortly after. We have two young daughters (7 and 3) together. Later that night, he came back to the house and didn’t say a word to me. 

The next day, he confessed he had left with the intention of committing suicide. He called 988 and they talked him down from it. I asked if he had a plan, and he said yes but wouldn’t tell me what it was. We talked about how his brother and dad both committed suicide and he needs to be here for his kids. 

Later that night, I was in the bedroom and I had just put the kids to bed. I heard him talking to someone and I could hear him slurring his words. He had called 988 again after drinking 10oz of whiskey on an empty stomach within half an hour. He hung up with 988 and told me he wanted to die. He repeated over and over he didn’t want to live anymore, why hasn’t he died yet. Shortly after he started vomiting everywhere. It was so violent he fell off the couch and knocked over the coffee table. In between heaving, he kept repeating he wanted to die. 

I ended up calling 911. They took him to the hospital and I signed paperwork to hopefully keep him on an involuntary hold until he can be evaluated and determined if he needs inpatient therapy. 

My question is, am I right to file for temporary emergency full custody? I have no intentions of keeping the kids from him but I absolutely do not want him alone with them until he has done therapy and takes care of his mental health. 

I also am at a loss on what to do about his housing situation. I do not want him at the house in this condition. Do I find him a temporary apartment? ",0,1767274640.0,Divorce,2,0.5,False

Jim lied down on his bed and read his magazine.  About a half an hour into his magazine, the phone rang.  Jim figured it was for Wendy.  Wendy answered the phone.  Then she shouted from downstairs, “Jim!  Phone for you!  It’s Candi!”

Jim walked into the hallway and grabbed the cordless phone from the small hallway table.  He took the phone and went back to his room.  He said, “Hi, Candi.  How has your day been?”

“Mine has been well, sweetheart.  How has yours been?”

“It’s been good.  I haven’t been home long.  I just got through eating dinner.”

“That’s good.  I had classes today.  I just got through eating some chicken casserole, breadsticks and salad for dinner.”

“That sounds good,” Jim said.

Then Candi said, “Jim, I was on Mint Street earlier today.  I saw you and Paulina having a good time washing cars at Gilmore Auto Sales.”

“Yes, we did.  Then again, we always enjoy our job.”

“I’m glad you do.  I am glad to see you and Paulina and Pam get along great.”

Then, Jim heard that song he was listening to earlier at Gilmore Auto Sales.  He said, “Candi, I want you to listen to something on the radio.  A song I heard earlier.”

Jim put the phone up to the radio speaker so Candi could hear the song.  He left it there for about three minutes.  Then Jim said to her, “That song made me think of you.”

“Jim, that is so beautiful.”

“Just like you, sweetie.”

“Jim, you are so sweet.”

Jim and Candi spoke to each other for about five more minutes.  Candi told Jim about college.  She told him about her classes and how she was doing.  She was now taking courses in math and science.  Candi was anxious to get started on studying nursing.  Jim told Candi about school and how he was doing.  Considering this was Jim’s first year of high school and he was dealing with some more challenging courses, he was doing well.  On his last report card, Jim made five A’s and one B.  Jim made a few more friends, but he hung out mostly with those in the neighborhood.  They were very understanding to one another.

Jim also told Candi about English class.  He wrote some poems in that class, and he read some of them to Candi.  She was extremely impressed.

Not once during that phone call did Jim mention the phone call from the girl who said she knew him.  Right now, he decided to just let it drop.

Jim and Candi ended the phone call.  They said “I love you” to one another.

 

😊

 

That Wednesday saw school let out for the holiday break.  The day went by quickly.  After school, Jim went straight home.  When he got home, Wendy was there, waiting on him.  Jim offered to make a pizza for dinner.  Wendy accepted.  Jim took out a box of pizza crust mix, a jar of pizza sauce, pepperoni, a jar of mushrooms, some mozzarella and cheddar cheese, and he sliced a green pepper.  Jim baked the pizza for a few minutes.  It turned out really good.  It was the first time Jim had made a pizza from scratch.  He thought he did a good job.  Wendy agreed.  Jim liked to cook and was always happy to do it when he wanted to.

On Friday afternoon, Wendy asked Jim to go with her to do some last-minute Christmas shopping.  Jim agreed to join her.  He wanted to get something for Candi, and for his friends.  They wanted to get everything done this evening.

Wendy drove to the Park Road Shopping Center.  At the time, there was a J.C. Penney and a Woolworth.  Jim and Wendy went to both stores.  At Woolworth, Jim had already bought various three-dollar gifts for all the girls except Candi.  Jim still needed to get gifts for the guys.  Jim chose Hot Wheels cars for the guys (in turn, Jim usually got Hot Wheels cars from the guys, so he felt it was the least he could do).  Jim got the guys three cars each because he did not want them to feel short-changed since he got gifts for the girls at three dollars each (each car was about a dollar each).

Then Jim went to J.C. Penney.  He still had to find something for Candi.  Jim found a cute teddy bear with a heart on it.  The bear itself was orange.  Candi loved teddy bears so he felt this was something she would like and would make her think of him.  Jim saw he had more than enough money to get it, so he did.  Wendy told Jim not to get her anything, but he did anyway.  He got her a small box of chocolates.  He got that at Eckerd’s, which was also in the Park Road Shopping Center, just a short walk from J.C. Penney.

Jim met Wendy in the parking lot.  After they put their stuff in the car, Wendy drove to a nearby McDonald’s.  Jim ate a Big Mac and Wendy had a fish sandwich.  They split a large order of fries, and both drank Coke.  Jim asked Wendy how her recent doctor’s appointment went.  Wendy said, “Oh, it was nothing.  I have had some stomach trouble lately, but the doctor gave me some medicine for it.”

“I hope there’s no bug going around,” Jim said.

Jim knew Wendy had been throwing up quite a bit, especially in the mornings.  In his own mind, Jim was dismissing the possibility that Wendy was pregnant.  Jim said, “Mom, whatever it is, I hope it’s nothing serious.”

Wendy said, “Jim, it’s nothing for you to worry about.  Nothing life-threatening, and nothing earth shattering.”

“Okay, Mom.  If you say so.”

“Mom, I don’t know who this fellow you have been dating is.  But I hope you’re not letting him take advantage of you.  Don’t let temptation get the better of you.”

Wendy looked at Jim for about a minute, and then she said, “Jim, of course not.  We’re just friends and nothing more.  We do spend some time at his house.”

Wendy usually drove her car to the guy’s house.  After the date, she usually drove herself back to the house.  Jim did want to ask his mother what she and the guy did on their dates, but he didn’t.  If Wendy said there was nothing serious between her and her date, then so be it.  Jim usually told Wendy what he and Candi did on their dates, and when they spent time together.  Wendy trusted Jim a lot, and she was usually understanding.  Wendy knew Jim and Candi had every intention of saving themselves for marriage.  Wendy seemed very pleased about that.  She never wanted to see Jim get hurt.  And she never wanted to see Jim do anything that would hurt him in any way.  She knew he had dreams and ambitions, and she wanted to see him reach them.

Wendy and Jim started for home.  Jim made a request.  “Mom, would it be possible to drive past Gilmore Auto Sales?”

“Sure, Jim.  I suppose so.”

“Pam decked the place out with Christmas lights and I want to see them.”

Wendy drove on some side streets until she finally reached Mint Street.  She drove rather slowly on Mint Street, and then she reached Gilmore Auto Sales.  Sure enough, the place was lit up.  There were lights in almost every color of the rainbow.  Jim and Wendy both thought it was pretty, a sight to make one’s spirits tingle!  Jim thought Pam and Paulina did a pretty good job.  Jim was not working when they hung up the lights.

Jim and Wendy arrived home.  Jim and Wendy spent the better part of two hours wrapping the presents they bought.  After they got done, the phone rang.  Jim answered the phone.  He figured that girl must be the one calling.  It turned out it wasn’t.  Pam was on the other end.  She said, “Hi, Jim.  I understand you and your mother went past the car lot this evening.”

Jim said, “Yes, Pam.  As a matter of fact, we did.”

“Did you and your mother get your Christmas shopping done?”

“Yes, Pam.  We did.  We were on our way home from Park Road Shopping Center when we decided to go past the place.”

Pam asked Jim, “What did you two think?”

Jim answered, “Pam, you and Paulina did great.”

“Thanks, Jim.  And there’s another reason why I’m calling.”

“Sure, Pam.  What is it?”

Pam said, “Jim, if you wouldn’t mind, please come in about an hour early in the morning.  There’s something I would like you and Paulina to do for me.”

“Okay, Pam.  I can come in at eight.”

Then Pam said, “I’ll tell you two what it is when you get here in the morning.”

“Okay, Pam.  I’ll see you and Paulina tomorrow morning at eight.”

 

😊

 

Jim went to bed around nine.  He had to be up at around seven the next morning so he could be at Gilmore Auto Sales at eight.  Whatever Pam wanted Jim and Paulina to do, it must have been important.  Jim enjoyed working for Pam, so he was only too happy to come in early if he needed to.  Maybe Pam wanted to get in some big sales before the Christmas holiday. 

The next morning, Jim got up a few minutes before seven.  He got a shower and fixed himself a breakfast of toast, yogurt and Coke.  Wendy soon woke up and joined Jim in the kitchen.  Wendy fixed her some toast and a cup of coffee.  After Wendy ate breakfast, she went upstairs to get dressed.  After Wendy got upstairs, the doorbell rang.  Jim answered it.  Pam and Paulina showed up.  Jim took Pam and Paulina into the kitchen.  Jim fixed Pam a cup of coffee and Paulina a cup of Coke.  Jim also made both of them some toast.  Wendy soon showed up in the kitchen.  Wendy asked Pam and Paulina why they were there, and Pam said, “Wendy, I called Jim last night and told him to come in at eight this morning.  I have something important I need him and Paulina to do.”

“I guess it’s okay with me.”

“Okay, then.  I guess we best get going.”

Jim, Pam and Paulina left the house and headed for Gilmore Auto Sales.  On the way, Paulina asked Jim, “What did you and your mother think of those Christmas lights?”

“They looked pretty.  I told Mom to drive by the car lot after we got our Christmas shopping done last night.”

“Where did you two go last night?” Paulina asked.

Jim answered, “Park Road Shopping Center.  We went to Eckerd’s, J.C. Penney and Woolworth.  Then we ate at McDonald’s.”

“Sounds good.  What did you have?”

“I had a Big Mac and fries.”

Then Pam asked Jim, “Have you heard from that girl lately?”

Jim answered, “No, I haven’t.  But I guess I’ll be hearing from her soon.  I do have questions and I really do need some answers.”

Pam said, “Yes, Jim.  That’s about the only way you are going to find out anything you need to know about her.”

Jim would soon find out about her.  Not only would his questions be answered, he would also find out a lot more about her.

 

😊

 

They arrived at Gilmore Auto Sales.  Jim saw there were a few more cars than there were on Thursday when he last worked.  He also noticed some different ones. 

Pam soon told Jim and Paulina what she needed done.  “Jim and Paulina, I know you two are wondering why you two are here early.  I got some different automobiles.  I need the marquee on the sign changed and I know you are the two who can do just that.”

Pam took Jim and Paulina to the storage building behind the office.  In addition to the two wagons used to carry the stuff to clean the cars, Pam had another wagon.  This wagon carried flexible panels for the marquee.  Pam had everything arranged so that the number and letter panels could not be mixed up.  In addition, there were some dollar signs and exclamation marks, and even some smiley faces and special holiday symbols. 

Pam had Jim pull the wagon to the front of the office.  Jim and Paulina joined Pam in the office.  Pam took two pieces of paper from the desk.  Pam said to them, “Jim and Paulina, I need to change the sign outside.  On these two pieces of paper is what I was the sign to say.  One for each side.”

After Pam gave Jim and Paulina the two pieces of paper, they got a look at them.  They had info on two cars Pam wanted to advertise, along with holiday symbols she wanted to use.  “What’s this about, Mom?” Paulina asked.

Pam answered, “I got two more cars yesterday.  A Pontiac Trans Am and a Cadillac Seville.  I want to advertise them.  And because of this being the holiday season, I want to use three Christmas symbols, a Santa Claus, a wreath and a tree, one on each side.”

Jim and Paulina saw what the pieces of paper said.  On one of them:

 

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

1979 PONTIAC TRANS AM

LOW MILES!  $3295

 

And on the other piece of paper:

 

SEASON’S GREETINGS!

1981 CADILLAC SEVILLE

LOADED!  $4895

 

Pam said, “Okay.  That’s what I want the signs to say.  One for each side, along with a Santa Claus, a tree and a wreath on each side.  It doesn’t matter which car you put on what side.  Just get it done.”

Jim and Paulina stepped outside.  There were two signs on one side of the lot.  One sign had “Gilmore Auto Sales” made out in different colors.  On the bottom of that same sign, the logo for Coke.  Another sign was a marquee.  It had three rows on each side.  Pam used the marquee to advertise automobiles for sale. 

Pam stepped outside behind Jim and Paulina.  They went back to the storage building.  Jim took, at Pam’s direction, a tall ladder.  Then Pam went back into the office while Jim and Paulina got busy changing the marquee sign.  Jim agreed to use the ladder and change the panels.  Paulina would hand Jim the panels as he needed them.  Jim and Paulina made the decision on which car would be advertised on what side.  They started on the side facing Dilworth.  This side would advertise the Pontiac Trans Am.

Jim climbed up on the ladder.  Paulina watched him on the ground.  Paulina handed Jim panels as he asked for them.  Paulina would tell Jim how to put each panel in.  She would also tell Jim how far apart to make each word.  Jim started with the top row, the one that would say “Happy Holidays.”  Paulina thought Jim did a good job and caught on quickly.  Now it was on to the second row, the one that would advertise the Pontiac.  Before they could finish that line, there was a blast of a car horn.  It came from a car passing the car lot, going toward uptown.  Jim and Paulina turned toward the passing car.  It was a Mustang, light blue in color.  Jim and Paulina figured it to be about a 1967 model.  There were three people in the car.  They all waved to Jim and Paulina, and they shouted, “Hi there, you two!”  Jim and Paulina both waved back.  One of those people, a teenage girl, stuck her head out the window as she waved.  Jim asked Paulina, “Do we know those people?”

Pam stepped outside as Paulina answered, “No, Jim.  I don’t think so.  They don’t look familiar to me.”

Jim said, “I don’t know them, either.  They don’t look familiar to me.”

Paulina asked, “Mom, have we sold a Mustang lately, about a 1967 model?”

“No, I don’t think so.  The last Mustang I sold was about five weeks ago, a 1972.  And we still have that 1976 Mustang.”

Pam got a look at the marquee and said, “Nice job so far, you two.”

Pam turned around and started back for the office.  About halfway, she stopped and turned around and asked Jim and Paulina, “Did you two know those folks in that Mustang that just passed by?”

Jim said, “No, Pam.  We don’t think so.”

Then Paulina said, “They didn’t look familiar to us.”

Pam headed back to the office, and Jim and Paulina went back to work.  They finished that one side.  Then they went to the other side, facing uptown.  This side would advertise the Cadillac Seville.  Once again, Jim did a good job.  Just as they got through, Pam opened the car lot. 

It seemed to be a good day at Gilmore Auto Sales.  Pam asked Jim to help sell the cars.  During the four-hour working period, they managed to sell four cars.  The Pontiac and the Cadillac were not sold.  Jim and Paulina were hoping whoever was driving that Mustang would drive by the place again soon.  They wanted to get a good look at them.  That did not happen.

 

😊

 

A little after one, Pam closed the car lot.  Just as she did, Wendy drove into the lot to pick up Jim.  Audrey and Julie were with her. 

Wendy drove to the Eckerd Drug Store at the corner of Trade and Tryon Streets.  Wendy parked on the side of Tryon Street.  Jim wanted to go into Eckerd’s with Wendy and Audrey, but Julie grabbed Jim by his arm, and she said, “Jim, please come with me to the record store.  There’s something we need to check out.”

Jim and Julie walked to a record store just a few stores past Eckerd’s.  On the way to the record store, they heard an oldies song coming from a nearby car.  The Coasters.  *That Charlie Brown…he’s gonna get caught!*  Jim asked Julie, “Why are we going to the record store?”

Julie answered, “There’s a new record I need to try and find.  I heard the song on the radio yesterday and it sounded good.  I just need someone to go in with me.”

Jim and Julie stepped into the record store.  A song was playing.  It was from a group by the name of DeBarge.  *You Wear It Well*.  As soon as Julie heard it, she said, “That’s it, Jim.  That’s the song.”

“Julie, I know what you mean.  That sounds like a good song.”

Jim and Julie both found a record of that song.  Just as they did, two girls walked to where Jim and Julie were.  One of those girls said, “Hi, Julie.  How’s it going?”

Julie knew the girls from school.  She said to them, “Hi, girls.  It’s going okay.  I found that song I was looking for.”

One of those girls asked, “Julie, who’s your cute friend there?”

Julie answered, “A friend of mine.  Jim Faulkner.  We live next to each other.  He works at that used car lot on Mint Street.”

The two girls said together, “Hi, gorgeous!”

Jim waved at them.  Then Julie said, “Girls, bad news.  He’s spoken for.”

And with that, the girls left.  Julie said, “Don’t worry, Jim.  Just some girls I know from school.  Let’s pay for our records and let’s head back to Eckerd’s to meet our mothers.”

After Jim and Julie paid for their records, they headed back to Eckerd’s.  When they got there, Wendy and Audrey were still in the store.  Jim and Julie decided they did not need anything from Eckerd’s, so they went back to Wendy’s Volvo.

On the way back home, Julie said to Jim, “I see Pam finally decided to change the sign.”

Jim said, “Actually, Paulina and I did that.”

“Looks like you two did a very good job,” Audrey said.

Then Jim said, “Something strange happened.  While Paulina and I were changing the sign, three people passed us in a Mustang, and they waved at us.”

“What did the Mustang look like?” Julie asked.

Jim answered, “A 1967 Mustang.  Light blue in color.  There were three people in it.  One, who looked like a teenage girl, stuck her head out the window.”

Julie looked at Jim strangely, and she said, “That’s funny.  I don’t know anyone with a car like that.”

“Jim, do you have any idea what those three looked like?” Wendy asked.

“A man and a woman, both about your age.  And a teenage girl, I’d say around thirteen.”

Audrey said, “Those descriptions could fit anyone.”

Jim said, “I hope I see them again.  I would like to get a better look at them.”

Then Wendy asked, “Jim, you don’t think the girl in that Mustang is the one who called you and didn’t tell you who she was?”

Jim thought about it for about a minute.  Then he said, “Mom, I don’t know.  I guess I didn’t think much about that.”

 

😊

 

Monday came.  It was a gray and cool morning, but it would clear up later in the day.  Jim went to Eastland Mall, just as he had planned.  Wendy drove him there.  Charmaine and Jodi went with them.  Jim was more than ready to meet this girl.  Jim sat at a table in front of Chick-fil-A.  Jodi sat with him.  They both ate a chicken sandwich and drank a cup of Coke.  When the girl called, she asked Jim to meet him around eleven o’ clock.  Jim and Jodi sat and waited.  Eleven o’ clock came.  Nothing.  No sign of her.  Jim and Jodi sat and waited for another hour. A little after noon, Jim and Jodi finally decided to give up and leave Chick-fil-A.  They met Wendy and Charmaine in front of Belk.  Then they went home.  Maybe the girl chose not to show up.  If she did call Jim again, he decided he would not say anything to her about not showing up.

 

😊

 

Tuesday of that week was Christmas Eve.  Jim went to work at Gilmore Auto Sales.  Paulina was also working.  Pam kept the car lot closed for the day.  There were also some additions.  Pam asked Wendy, Audrey, Malachi and Julie to work some at the car lot.  Pam needed to clean out the office and she needed some extra help.  Wendy and Audrey took down the Christmas lights since no one would be at the car lot until the following Monday (Pam decided to close the car lot for the Christmas week).  Pam got the younger ones to help her clean out the office.  Jim and Malachi helped Pam dispose of old paperwork and old receipts from past automobile sales that had been piling up and cluttering up the office for some time.  Pam, Jim and Malachi put the old papers in big black Hefty bags.  Paulina and Julie were assigned to dust the office furniture, clean the small microwave oven, clean out the small refrigerator (and put in a fresh box of baking soda), and they cleaned out the restroom and the toilet. 

After Jim and Malachi got the old paperwork and trash into the bags, they took them out of the office.  Jim and Malachi got Julie to help them get the big heavy bags out to the curb.  On the way, Jim said, “I wonder if that girl is gonna call again.  And if she does, I hope to find out who she is.”

Julie said, “I’m sure she will.  It’s just not right for her to call you and not tell you who she is.”

Then Malachi said, “And you just may wanna find out how she knows you and how she found out about you.”

When they got to the curb, they got a look at the Charlotte skyline.  It was barely visible through the fog.  The sky was very cloudy, and there was a chill in the air.  It seemed like this winter was about to be yet another cold one.  Maybe there would be a major winter storm this winter.  But right now, it was not cold enough for snow.  Everyone hoped for snow for Christmas.  The last time it snowed on Christmas in Charlotte was way back in 1947.  That was thirty-eight years ago. 

They got the bags to the curb and ready for pickup.  Jim said, “I sure hope she calls again.  Maybe the mystery will be revealed.  I hope to find out who she is.”

What Jim did not know was this.  She would call again.  And he would find out who she was…and a lot more!



😊

 

Christmas turned out to be pretty good.  Jim got a new color TV set for his bedroom, along with some die-cast metal cars and some cassette tapes.

As the week progressed, Wendy took Jim to the parking lot of an abandoned department store on Wilkinson Boulevard.  Wendy taught Jim how to drive.  At this point, Jim had a learner’s permit.  Wendy did not limit Jim’s learning to drive to the parking lot of that abandoned department store.  She did let Jim drive some in the neighborhood, and in some other nearby neighborhoods.  Jim eventually got to drive on Charlotte streets, and even on the freeways.  He did start out rough, but he got better with time.  By the first week of 1986, Jim would do well enough to get a driver’s license.",1,1767274576.0,u_jim21869,0,1.0,False

1q148hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlinsocialclub/comments/1q148hz/friends/,Friends,"Hi. Impulsive new year's day post!

I'm 54 M, queer, arrived in Berlin six years ago, working in a social profession. I've met some people but not everyone can meet often. This seems to be a Berlin-specific pattern!  
  
Lately, I've realized that I need more people in my life, and specifically people who can meet/talk often. I don't speak to my family back home so frequently, and as I get older, I realized I'm not ok with solitude any more (I was ok with it for a very long time). This is just for friends, not a partner. If anyone is in a similar position or just looking for friends in Berlin, please feel free to send me a pm. I realize this sub caters mostly to younger age groups, but wth, I thought I'd try my luck! There should be some older lurkers like me out there, but really, I get along with both older and younger people. 

Interests: I like going to movies a lot. Also reading, writing, book clubs, long walks, running, swimming, old fashioned board games, traveling especially city trips, discussions about politics/society and talks about personal stuff over coffee/dinner. So mostly quiet stuff. Bars are ok, clubs not really. Fluent in English and German (preferable if the other person is also ok with it).",8,1767274203.0,berlinsocialclub,2,0.83,False
1q148fh,https://i.redd.it/ytpkqwy9pqag1.png,The Rejected Luna Returns,"Ten years after being cast out by my family, my mate, and my pack, I met my former Alpha mate and brother by adoption in a small town.

After all these years apart, one had become a decorated Alpha warrior, the other a high-ranking Alpha—and I was just running a tiny coffee shop.

The moment our eyes met, both men froze for a long time.

Then Adrian hid the pregnancy test in his hand behind his back, and Mike slipped the jewelry he'd bought for his sister into his pocket.

I lowered my gaze, packed up the cake and coffee, and handed them over politely.

""Here you are, Alphas.""

The overly distant address made both of them falter for a second.

As they pushed open the door to leave, Adrian suddenly turned around and asked,

""You said you'd never bake desserts again for the rest of your life, didn't you?""

I smiled politely. ""Just something foolish I said in anger.""

The sound of children laughing and playing outside drifted in faintly through the glass door, but it couldn't break the stagnation inside the shop.

The two Alphas who'd teamed up to have me cast out from the pack all those years ago still stood at the cash register, refusing to leave.

Adrian clutched the box of macarons and coffee, his throat worked,

""Eden's having bad morning sickness. We're bringing her to stay south of the pack for a while.""

""Your mother… came with us too.""

""Would you like to see her?""

I shook my head as I wiped the counter. ""No need. Give my regards to Luna Juliet.""

Pausing, I added, ""Or don't mention it at all—better to avoid misunderstandings.""

My foster brother Mike's knuckles whitened as he tightened his grip,

""Hazel, all these years we—""

""Hazel!""

A girl with dyed green hair bounced through the door, threw her arms around mine, and shook me, ""I'm starving!""

A genuine smile finally spread across my face as I tapped her nose, ""There's your favorite chocolate chip cookie in the fridge.""

""Noooo,"" Isla whined, ""Hazel, eat with me.""

I glanced helplessly at the two men, my smile fading: ""Alphas, your cake and coffee are ready.""

Adrian's gaze flickered when he heard ""chocolate chip cookie.""

Mike stared blankly at Isla's lively figure, the rest of his words died on his lips.

I took Isla's hand and walked into the back kitchen, the automatic door sliding shut to cut off their view.

When I emerged again, the shop was empty.

Isla mumbled around her fork: ""Hazel, do you know those two Alphas? They were looking at you weird.""

""When they arrived, I saw a whole entourage—warriors and everything.""

""I heard one's a famous Alpha warrior across all packs, and the other's a respected Alpha.""

I kept my head down as I sorted through receipts. ""Here, they're just customers.""

""If I really knew people like that,"" I poked her forehead gently, ""would I be waking up early every day to bake you cakes and cookies?""

Isla giggled, leaning in to whisper in my ear:

""Word is that Alpha warrior's Luna is that other Alpha's sister—they came all the way here for her to rest during her pregnancy. It must be wonderful to be so cherished.""

I nodded calmly, tossing a used piping bag into the trash can.

Of course I knew how much they spoiled Eden.

After all, ten years ago—

One had had me committed to a werewolf psychiatric hospital on our mating ceremony night, branding me a laughingstock, a madwoman.

The other had announced my death to the pack and personally driven me out into exile.

Together, they'd shattered me completely and cast mee into a living hell.

# Chapter 2

""What's this?""

Isla picked up a braided bracelet from beside the counter.

It had an army-green cord clasp stained with dried blood, and a tiny silver bullet casing dangled from it.

I lifted my gaze and recognized it—the ""protection charm"" I'd given Adrian all those years ago.

Back then, he wasn't yet a decorated Alpha warrior with shiny insignia on his shoulders; he was just a teenager, abandoned at the edges of the pack territory, left to survive on his own after his Alpha father's corruption scandal.

I'd found him by the lake on a winter night.

Battered and bruised, he'd curled up in a snowdrift before suddenly reaching out to grab the hem of my pants.

Against my mother and brother's objections, I'd brought him back to the pack, paid a pack healer with my allowance, and pulled him back from the brink of death.

Sixteen-year-old Adrian had stayed in the Darkstone Pack ever since, becoming my loyal shadow.

When I'd snuck out of school by climbing over the wall, he'd been there to break my fall.

When I'd been punished to stand in the corridor, he'd silently kept me company until midnight.

When I'd been bullied, he'd been the first to step up—even if it meant getting pummeled until he was black and blue.

Later, when young over first bloomed between us, we'd hidden in the lavender bushes in the pack house garden to kiss, laughing like two kids who'd stolen candy.

Until the year he turned nineteen, when he'd determined to join in the harshest pack border unit.

""Hazel, wait for me.""

""When I've earned my merits and restored my father's honor, I'll come back and make you my Luna—proudly.""

He'd kissed my hair over and over, ""I'll return. I promise, and you're my only mate for life.""

I'd stayed up all night crying and baking his favorite chocolate chip cookies all night, then slipped this bracelet into his duffel bag.

My mother and Mike had never liked him, but they'd given in to my tears.

In the end, they'd used the Darkstone Pack's connections to smooth the path for his early career.

Over two years, Adrian's name had started appearing in military reports.

He'd brought back a Third-Class Merit from the pack borders, then a Second-Class Merit—one news after another of his rapid promotion by the Alpha King himself.

The day he was transferred back to the Werewolf Realm, my hands had shaken with joy.

But on that same day, the truth about my origins came to light.

I wasn't the Alpha's daughter of the Darkstone Pack.

I was just a child who'd been deliberately swapped by a pack house maid—my biological parents worked in a meat processing plant.

They were omegas.

The day the real Alpha's daughter, Eden, was brought back to the pack, my mother had taken my hand and promised, ""Even if Eden's home now, you're still my daughter.""

Mike had ruffled my hair, smiling as always,

""It just means one more person in the pack house, Hazel. Nothing will change.""

Adrian hadn't even reported to the Alpha King first—he'd rushed to find me, pulling me tightly into his arms, ""I can protect you now.""

""Even if your pack, your Alpha parents and brother don't want you, I do.""

My anxious heart had finally settled.

Out of guilt and a desire to make up for, I'd started putting Eden first in everything.

I'd taken her shopping, taught her Luna etiquette, let her pick first from all the good things—afraid of making her feel the slightest bit uncomfortable.

Eden had always linked arms with me and called me ""Hazel"" sweetly, her eyes crinkling into crescents.

Back then, I'd been truly happy, thinking there was no better family or lover in the world.

Later, Adrian and I had started bringing Eden along on our dates.

At first, Adrian had protested fiercely, saying Eden was ruining our time alone;

Eden had also turned red with anger, accusing Adrian of having bad intentions and trying to take advantage of me.

I'd mediated between them, barely keeping the peace on the surface.

Slowly, before I knew it, Adrian had started remembering Eden's preferences, her cycle, her clothing size—and Eden had always pestered me to tell her stories about Adrian's childhood.

Until that car accident on Christmas Eve.

When the car skidded and crashed into the guardrail, I'd watched helplessly as Adrian had twisted his body to shield Eden in his arms first.

My forehead had slammed into the back of the front seat, blood streaming down my eyelashes.

In the pack hospital, he'd held my hand and explained,

""Hazel, I mistook Eden for you in the moment. I'm sorry.""

I'd said nothing, my heart sinking into an ice pit—a deep, cold certainty settled in me that something fundamental had broken.

The day my stitches were removed, I'd checked out of the hospital early.

In the lavender bushes of the pack house garden, I'd seen two overlapping figures.

Adrian's fingers had been tangled in Eden's hair, lost in a kiss that was both deep and tender.

# Chapter 3

I stood frozen, convinced I was trapped in some cruel, twisted nightmare.

But the raw, tearing agony in my chest and the whimpers of my wolf were too real to ignore.

I charged forward, yanking them apart and sending lavender blossoms scattering across the ground, then raised my hand and put all my weight behind a slap that cracked across Adrian's cheek.

Adrian didn't flinch—but when I turned toward Eden, he suddenly sized my wrist and shoved me back violently.

I stumbled and fell onto the lawn, the skin of my palms torn open by sharp gravel, yet he only shielded Eden, his voice cold and harsh,

""Eden's your sister. What gives you the right to lay a hand on her?""

""Hazel, look at yourself—you look completely unhinged.""

Eden leaned into his chest, sobbing:

""I'm sorry, Hazel… but Adrian and I are truly in love. If we hadn't been swapped, I would've been the one to meet him first.""

Her lips still glistened with the faint sheen of their kiss.

""I can apologize, but I won't give Adrian back to you.""

The last thread of my sanity snapped in that moment.

I grabbed a flower pot and hurled it at them, screaming every vicious curse I could think of.

Adrian only sneered. ""You really should check yourself into a psych ward.""

When Mother and Mike arrived, they frowned at my disheveled state:

""Hazel, stop making a scene.""

""Eden's your sister—must you make this so ugly?""

They stood side by side, their expressions identical in coldness and irritation.

And there I was, across from them, a mess of tangled hair and dirt, looking like a lunatic.

In that instant, a horrifying realization dawned on me.

But I refused to accept it.

I raced to Adrian's pack territory to find him, screaming and crying beneath the windows of his pack house.

He only pushed open a window and said:

""Keep harassing Eden, and I'll file for a restraining order.""

Bitterness coiled around my heart like poison ivy.

I tracked down the Alpha King's Beta, accusing Adrian of betrayal and Eden of knowingly pursuing a mated male.

I protested outside Adrian's pack house, desperate to ruin their reputations, to make everyone see the truth.

This Alpha warrior, whose rise I had supported and funded was nothing but an oath-breaking bastard.

In the end, Darkstone Pack warriors dragged me back.

Even when I smashed everything in sight and held a silver dinner knife to my own throat, all I got was a slap from Mike, ""Hazel, haven't you caused enough trouble?""

""You stole twenty years of Eden's life. All of this is what you owe her!""

They locked me in the pack dungeon, sliding only a moldy piece of bread through the cracks each day.

The darkness and the suffocating silence sanded me down grinding down every sharp edge of my resolve.

Until one day, the iron door creaked open, and Adrian stood silhouetted against the light,

""The Alpha King has ordered me to seal the mate bond with you.""

""Hazel, you will be my Luna.""

# Chapter 4

Adrian's silhouette was indistinct, haloed by the harsh light.

I was released, and preparations for the mating ceremony began in a hurry.

The night before the ceremony, Mother spoke offhandedly in the pack house living room,

""Now that you've come to your senses, get ready properly. Eden's been emotionally unstable lately—go apologize to her when you have time.""

Mike flicked ash from his cigarette, ""Hazel, be obedient. That way, the pack can still spare you some dignity.""

I wanted to laugh, but I didn't even have the strength to curl my lips.

Weeks of confinement and torment had leached all the vitality from me; even my wolf had grown numb and silent.

Seeing my silence, Adrian's tone turned sharp, ""The bond-sealing deal's been approved—what more could you possibly want?""

""If we're keeping score, everything you have now was stolen from Eden anyway, wasn't it?""

""Keep acting out, and neither your pack nor I will have any use for you.""

Eden, sheltered between them, spoke softly, ""Hazel, I'm craving the chocolate chip cookies you make.""

""The ones… you used to bake specially for Adrian.""

Chocolate chip cookies.

I'd stayed up all night baking them for him the day his father was sentenced, when he'd been delirious with a high fever.

Later, they'd become our little secret, our promise to each other.

Adrian had once pinned me against the kitchen counter and made me swear on our bond that I'd never, ever bake them for another living soul.

Now, they'd become a tool for him to charm another.

A laugh burst out of me—long-suppressed hatred finally breaking free.

I grabbed the scalding coffee pot and hurled it at Eden's feet.

Glass shattered, and brown liquid splashed up her calves.

She screamed and threw herself into Mother and Mike's arms, while Adrian slapped me hard across the face, ""You're beyond saving.""

I was committed to a werewolf psychiatric hospital on charges of ""assault"" and ""endangering the pack with mental instability.""

The signatures on my commitment papers belonged to Adrian and my brother, Mike.

Meanwhile, Eden wore a custom wedding dress and completed her mating ceremony in the pack hall.

As I lay in restraints undergoing forced treatment, they were consummating their bond on my wedding bed.

Three months later, I was dumped on the icy steps like a piece of discarded trash.

It snowed heavily that night—just like the day I'd found Adrian—but there was no one to extend a hand to me.

No one asked after me, no one came looking. The only thing I had left was the blood-stained bracelet clutched tightly in my hand.

""Hazel, are you okay?"" Isla touched my hand.

I snapped back to reality, pinching her cheek gently.

It was over. I'd survived.

I'd left the pack, left that territory, and drifted until I finally settled in Roseford, scrimped and saved for years to buy this little place.

I'd thought I'd never see them again—but fate had other plans.

""Throw it away,"" I said, staring at the bullet casing bracelet in Isla's hand. ""It's just trash.""

As soon as the words left my mouth, the glass door flew open.

Adrian had returned, his breath ragged as he stopped in front of the counter.

His eyes fixed on the bracelet, his eyes suspiciously bright,

""Hazel, we need to talk.""

\[12/31, 12:55 PM\] Him: <Shares screenshot of booking>
It was actually booked in Saturday and when I got there they told me they’d call Monday, which they didn’t obviously, so it’s been a case of not knowing if I’m coming or going! Typical really, best laid plans and all that jazz.

Follow-up discussion

\[1/1, 11:50 AM\] OP:
Hey can I be completely honest
The way the whole date situation was handled yesterday really blindsided me

\[1/1, 12:00 PM\] Him:
It has? In what way? Talk to me 😊

\[1/1, 12:08 PM\] OP:
If I’m completely honest, regardless of the reason, I found cancelling a date that’s been scheduled for several weeks literally hours prior rather disrespectful, inconsiderate and a sign of lack of interest.
I personally couldn’t envision doing that. I’d have Uber’d it, rescheduled the car appointment if it wasn’t urgent or at the very least apologised and made proactive attempts at clear communication and rescheduled the date.

I didn’t sense any of that. I want to be clear that the specifics are irrelevant here — what the garage did or didn’t do is beside the point. It’s the attitude, lack of communication and lack of effort that really bothered me.

\[1/1, 12:13 PM\] Him:
Well I can only apologise if that’s how you felt. Of course it isn’t symbolic of a lack of interest.
My casual nature means that when the unforeseeable does happen I’m fairly nonchalant with it. I didn’t think rescheduling for later that day or the following day would be much of an issue if I’m honest.

My thinking was get to the point, communicate the change and rearrange. Once it was clear we weren’t able to rearrange then there really wasn’t much else to be said.

\[1/1, 12:27 PM\] OP:
For most people, the whole point of arranging a date and time is that everyone sticks to it and respects it. If the idea was it could be pushed around on the day because something random came up, there wouldn’t be much point agreeing a slot at all. It also signals where priorities lie.

\[1/1, 12:33 PM\] Him:
I’m not sure that’s quite how I see it. Arranging a date and time is of course the aim, but if someone says “can we push it back an hour” or “move it forward an hour,” I think that’s okay.
You have to be flexible — it’s a date, not a business appointment! Life is unpredictable and one must move with the flow without attaching deeper meaning to it.

\[1/1, 12:43 PM\] OP:
I hear you, and that’s sort of my point. It’s not the specifics that matter to me, it’s the approach.
There was no “sorry, this has come up and 12 won’t work — does X pm work instead?” That would have been fine.

I think we’re on different pages here. Principles matter a lot to me and I see things through integrity, reliability and communication — but I appreciate your perspective.

\[1/1, 12:50 PM\] Him:
Admittedly I was holding out hope I’d still be able to make it and assumed the location you'd chosen was close for you, so it wouldn’t be much inconvenience to adjust — but I take your point.

Really? 😂
Does every inconsequential instance in life connect to integrity and reliability?
That must be rather exhausting!!

# What Makes Minimax M2.1 Different

Minimax M2.1 isn’t a chatbot.

It’s an **agentic AI** built to think several steps ahead.

It plans, executes, and corrects itself — without needing you to babysit.

Other coding AIs write a single function.

Minimax M2.1 writes entire systems.

It can understand thousands of lines of code, debug across files, and even refactor full codebases.

You give it a high-level prompt, and it does everything.

# Enter Google Antigravity

Here’s where it gets wild.

**Google Antigravity** is an IDE designed for AI agents to work autonomously.

Instead of you writing the code, it gives Minimax a workspace to execute it.

Two main views:

* **Editor view:** where the code lives.
* **Manager view:** where you watch multiple AI agents build, test, and document everything in real time.

It also generates **artifacts** — logs, screenshots, test results — proof that every action really happened.

This is full transparency for autonomous coding.

# Why They’re the Perfect Match

Minimax M2.1 is the **brain**.

Google Antigravity is the **body**.

Together, they’re unstoppable.

Minimax plans the project.

Antigravity executes the code, runs the tests, and shows you the results — automatically.

It’s like giving your AI a full development environment and saying, “Build this while I get coffee.”

# Real Example: From Prompt to Product

You want to build a landing page for the **AI Profit Boardroom** that promotes AI automation and gets signups.

You type one line:

>

Minimax creates the plan — structure, layout, assets, and functions.

Then Antigravity executes the plan.

It codes the sections, applies your brand colors, adds interactivity, and even tests responsiveness.

In minutes, you have a working page — with a full record of every step.

# Fixing Bugs Automatically

Got broken forms or analytics issues?

Minimax M2.1 finds the errors, writes the fixes, and lets Antigravity apply and test them.

You don’t even touch the console.

The artifacts prove it’s fixed.

That’s not just automation.

That’s **autonomy**.

# Automating Entire Workflows

Say you need to automate reports.

Pull member data, generate a chart, email the results.

You describe it once.

Minimax M2.1 breaks it down, writes the scripts, and Antigravity runs them automatically.

Now your workflow is fully hands-free.

This is how agencies are saving 20+ hours per week.

# Inside the AI Success Lab

If you want the templates and AI workflows, check out **Julian Goldie’s FREE AI Success Lab Community** here: [https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/](https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/)

Inside, you’ll see how creators are using **Minimax M2.1 + Google Antigravity** to automate everything from client onboarding to content creation.

They’re training AI agents on company SOPs.

They’re generating web apps from one prompt.

They’re scaling content and automations faster than ever before.

This isn’t theory — it’s happening right now.

# The Future of Coding

The future isn’t “AI-assisted.”

It’s **AI-operated**.

You won’t be writing code.

You’ll be describing the outcome — and AI will build it.

That’s what Minimax M2.1 represents.

It’s the bridge between prompt and product.

Five years from now, this will be the standard.

The people learning it today will lead the next generation of developers and founders.

# Getting Started

You can try Minimax M2.1 now.

Go to the **Minimax open platform** or **HuggingFace** to get access.

Run it through the API or locally if you have GPU hardware.

For **Google Antigravity**, check Google’s latest IDE docs.

The setup is simple — if you can write a prompt, you can use it.

Start small.

Automate one task.

Then scale.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

I love coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

1q1438q,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1q1438q/the_sciencebased_dopamine_detox_that_actually/,The Science-Based Dopamine Detox That ACTUALLY Works: 30 Days to Unfry Your Brain,"
**Real talk.** Your brain is cooked. Mine was too. 

I spent months researching dopamine regulation through neuroscience papers, behavioral psychology books, and interviews with addiction specialists because I couldn't focus for more than 90 seconds without reaching for my phone. The average person touches their phone 2,617 times a day. We're basically lab rats pressing the pleasure button until we die. Your ancestors would be horrified.

But here's what nobody tells you about dopamine detoxes, most of them are pseudoscience garbage that misunderstand how dopamine actually works. Dopamine isn't the enemy. It's your brain's motivation currency. The problem isn't dopamine itself, it's that we've inflated the currency so badly through constant overstimulation that normal life feels like watching paint dry. Your baseline is fucked. 

The good news? Neuroplasticity is real. Your brain can rewire itself. I pulled together protocols from neuroscience research, addiction recovery methods, and behavioral design principles that actually reset your dopamine sensitivity. No monk mode bullshit. No sitting in a dark room for 24 hours. Just practical recalibration.

**The first brutal truth: you need to cut the supernormal stimuli.** Social media, porn, junk food, video games, these aren't just  bad habits.  They're hijacking your reward system with dopamine hits that real life can't compete with. Dr. Anna Lembke's work at Stanford shows that our brains adapted for scarcity are drowning in abundance. Her book *Dopamine Nation* breaks down how pleasure and pain are balanced on a neurological seesaw, when you flood one side with artificial highs, your baseline drops below zero. You end up needing stimulation just to feel normal. The book basically explains why you feel like shit all the time despite having infinite entertainment options. Changed how I understood my own brain completely.

The protocol starts with a **7 day hard reset.** Remove the big four: social media apps (delete them, not just log out), streaming services, video games, and porn. Replace doomscrolling with literally anything else. Your brain will throw a tantrum like a toddler whose iPad died. Let it. This is your dopamine receptors upregulating, becoming sensitive again to normal rewards. 

**Boredom is the actual cure.** Sounds insane but Dr. Sandi Mann's research on boredom shows it's when your brain does its deepest processing and creative work. Most people are so overstimulated they've forgotten what boredom feels like. Just sit there. Stare at a wall. Your mind will race, you'll feel anxious, you'll want to grab your phone so badly your fingers will itch. Don't. After about 20 minutes, something shifts. Your brain starts generating its own entertainment. This is where ideas come from. This is where you remember who you actually are under all the digital noise.

For the next 23 days, **reintroduce activities that build natural dopamine through effort and achievement.** Your brain needs to relearn that rewards come from work. Start a daily practice that has clear progress markers. Could be anything. Learning an instrument through an app like **Simply Piano** which gamifies practice without being exploitative. It gives you that achievement dopamine but you're actually building a real skill. 

**BeFreed** is an AI powered personalized learning app that pulls content from research papers, expert talks, and high quality book summaries to create custom audio podcasts matched to your goals. Built by Columbia University alumni and former Google engineers, it generates adaptive learning plans based on what you want to improve. You control the depth, from 10 minute summaries to 40 minute deep dives with detailed examples and context. The voice customization is genuinely addictive, you can pick a smoky, sarcastic tone or something calm for evening learning. It includes the neuroscience books mentioned here plus thousands more sources, all fact checked and science based. During commutes or gym sessions, it beats mindless scrolling while actually rewiring your reward system around real skill building.

Or try **Duolingo** for language learning, yeah it's got streaks and notifications but the dopamine comes from actual competency building, not just infinite scroll. The difference matters.

**Movement is non negotiable.** Exercise increases dopamine receptor density and baseline dopamine levels naturally. You're literally rebuilding your reward system's hardware. The research is overwhelming on this. James Nestor's *Breath* explains how even just breathwork and light movement rewires your nervous system. Not a fitness book, more about how your breathing patterns control your mental state. Practical techniques you can use when you feel that pull toward your phone. The Wim Hof breathing method he covers gives you a natural high that makes you realize how much you've been chasing artificial ones.

Around day 14, **implement stimulus control in your environment.** Your willpower is finite. Design your space so the path of least resistance leads to good behaviors. Keep your phone in another room when working. Use a **physical alarm clock** instead of your phone by your bed. Install **Freedom or Cold Turkey** apps that actually block sites and can't be easily bypassed. Your future self will try to bargain and disable these. Don't let present you give future you that option.

**Create friction for bad habits and remove friction for good ones.** Want to read more? Keep books everywhere. On your coffee table, nightstand, bathroom. Want to stop snacking? Don't buy snacks. Seems obvious but most people rely on willpower instead of environment design. BJ Fogg's *Tiny Habits* methodology shows behavior happens when motivation, ability and prompts converge. You can't always control motivation but you absolutely control ability through friction and prompts through environment. 

The final week is about **building your new dopamine baseline.** By now, scrolling should feel hollow and anxiety inducing rather than satisfying. That's your brain recognizing the manipulation. Start adding back **one** potentially problematic activity but with strict boundaries. Maybe 30 minutes of social media on weekends only. See how it feels. If you immediately spiral back into three hour sessions, you're not ready. Extend the detox.

**Track everything in a simple journal.** Not for productivity porn, but because your brain will try to convince you nothing's changing. Write down your focus duration, mood, urges, small wins. The data shows your progress when your feelings lie to you. On day 7 you'll write  this sucks everything is boring I hate this  and on day 23 you'll write  read for 90 minutes without checking my phone once, didn't even think about it. 

One month won't permanently fix years of dopamine abuse. But it resets your baseline enough that you remember what normal feels like. Your focus will be sharper, your mood more stable, your ability to start and complete tasks dramatically improved. More importantly, you'll have broken the Pavlovian conditioning between boredom and phone checking. That's the real win.

Your brain isn't broken forever. It's just been running bloatware for years. Time to factory reset.",1,1767273741.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

Growing up I was never allowed to have a boyfriend. They don’t believe in the term boyfriend, only guy friend, as boyfriend implies sexual relations. They believe in friends (as in going out for coffee), then religious marriage. When I met my now husband (19), I knew our relationship would be burnt to a crisp. So at first we hanged out on the down low, I used to tell them I sleep over at a friend and go to his place. But then they found out of course, and forbid me from ever seeing him again, by the threat of kicking me out (and my parents are never joking with this, I was kicked out multiple times). My boyfriend, 22 at that time jumped in and said I could
live with his family, which I did. I left right then and there. At some point I also got into law school. Once I left home my parents did not give a penny. They were very clear that if I choose to do this I am basically shunned. At 21 we got courthouse married to bring some legitimacy into our relationship. My family obviously didn’t come, it was a very sad day for me. Last month, I was faced with a sad truth- his family couldn’t support me anymore financially, and I had to go. My now husband earns decent, but it’s not enough for us to move out since I’m in college and don’t have the time for a job. The moment I got home my parents said - no contact with him whatsoever, no going out, you will eventually be put up with a boy from church and you will be happy. At the expense of kicking me out again if I don’t respect this, but this time I don’t have where to go. His parents are tired of this situation and consider that if I am this controlled it’s just too much for them and maybe it would be better for us to end things. They can’t financially afford me in college for 3 more years. So here I am, basically forced to be with my family, to participate in church, because I am financially dependent. I talk to my husband on a burner phone and I meet with him in secret. I have 2 options and none seem great - succumb to my parents and basically give up on my life so i can finish school, or quit college and get an entry-level job to support myself. What would you do?

Opened Reddit in the morning, closed it. Opened it again like something new would appear if I believe hard enough.

Day went by quietly. Made coffee. Spilled some. Said “nice” out loud for no reason. The cup didn’t judge me, which I appreciated.

Sat on my chair doing that thing where you rotate slightly and think about absolutely nothing. Laptop was open. Not working. Just… present. Like me.

Checked my phone a few times. Nothing urgent. Nothing unurgent either. Even spam was on holiday. Felt oddly personal.

Went out for a short walk. Said “sorry” to a scooter that wasn’t moving. Came back home and realised this is the longest conversation I’ve had today.

By evening, I wasn’t sad or happy. Just existing. Calm. Mildly amused.
Feels like one of those days where nothing happens, but you still feel like you participated somehow.

Over time I’ve noticed a consistent, additive effect from combining jiaogulan (Gynostemma pentaphyllum) with CoQ10, especially compared to using either one alone. Separately, both support steady energy and reduced fatigue, but together the effect feels more complete rather than redundant. Mechanistically, this makes sense since CoQ10 supports mitochondrial ATP production, while jiaogulan appears to act more on metabolic regulation and stress signaling pathways rather than direct stimulation. I’ve also found that pairing this with morning bright light exposure (around 10,000 lux) further improves alertness and mood, likely through circadian signaling rather than metabolism. The result is calm, sustainable energy instead of a jittery or forced “boost.” For me, this has been a solid way to start the day with either coffee or a cup of jiaogulan tea, especially when training for endurance-based strength rather than maximal lifts. This is personal experience, not a medical claim, but the physiology lines up well with how it feels in practice.",1,1767273056.0,GynostemmaJiaogulan,0,1.0,False

\[1/1, 12:00 PM\] Him:
It has? In what way? Talk to me 😊

\[1/1, 12:08 PM\] OP:
If I’m completely honest, regardless of the reason, I found cancelling a date that’s been scheduled for several weeks literally hours prior rather disrespectful, inconsiderate and a sign of lack of interest.
I personally couldn’t envision doing that. I’d have Uber’d it, rescheduled the car appointment if it wasn’t urgent or at the very least apologised and made proactive attempts at clear communication and rescheduled the date.

I didn’t sense any of that. I want to be clear that the specifics are irrelevant here — what the garage did or didn’t do is beside the point. It’s the attitude, lack of communication and lack of effort that really bothered me.

\[1/1, 12:13 PM\] Him:
Well I can only apologise if that’s how you felt. Of course it isn’t symbolic of a lack of interest.
My casual nature means that when the unforeseeable does happen I’m fairly nonchalant with it. I didn’t think rescheduling for later that day or the following day would be much of an issue if I’m honest.

My thinking was get to the point, communicate the change and rearrange. Once it was clear we weren’t able to rearrange then there really wasn’t much else to be said.

\[1/1, 12:27 PM\] OP:
For most people, the whole point of arranging a date and time is that everyone sticks to it and respects it. If the idea was it could be pushed around on the day because something random came up, there wouldn’t be much point agreeing a slot at all. It also signals where priorities lie.

\[1/1, 12:33 PM\] Him:
I’m not sure that’s quite how I see it. Arranging a date and time is of course the aim, but if someone says “can we push it back an hour” or “move it forward an hour,” I think that’s okay.
You have to be flexible — it’s a date, not a business appointment! Life is unpredictable and one must move with the flow without attaching deeper meaning to it.

\[1/1, 12:43 PM\] OP:
I hear you, and that’s sort of my point. It’s not the specifics that matter to me, it’s the approach.
There was no “sorry, this has come up and 12 won’t work — does X pm work instead?” That would have been fine.

I think we’re on different pages here. Principles matter a lot to me and I see things through integrity, reliability and communication — but I appreciate your perspective.

\[1/1, 12:50 PM\] Him:
Admittedly I was holding out hope I’d still be able to make it and assumed the location was close for you, so it wouldn’t be much inconvenience to adjust — but I take your point.

Really? 😂
Does every inconsequential instance in life connect to integrity and reliability?
That must be rather exhausting!!

1q13v0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1q13v0p/hm_forgotten_canadian_history_the_great_heist_of/,[HM] Forgotten Canadian History - The Great Heist Of Gooseneck,"On March twenty-second a heist was to occur inside the dimly lit and predictably designed Home Depot off Lake Road in Gooseneck, Ontario. The cast of unseasoned and reliably unremarkable personnel to pull this off would be as such:   
  
Francis Frank, a thirty-two year old slightly chubby man with severe anxiety and a Xanax prescription that was regularly refilled. He was often panicky or sleepy or both. His most notable line of work was as an Air Traffic Controller at the Gooseneck Airport, where mostly only private or “for fun” planes really flew out of. After several particularly close calls he was relieved of his employment.   
  
Rory “Big Mac” McDonald, A twenty-two  year old with a lean figure and backwards hat, who for a time was a lower end golf prospect. He played seriously through high school and then college, followed by a short stint on the Corn Ferry tour. While his mechanics and fundamentals were exceptionally good, he could not play beautifully. He was not traditionally athletic nor very creative, but damn was he ever good at reading an instruction manual.  
Amateur Sports Magazine -owned only by parents who’s kid’s name was mentioned in it - once wrote: “His ability to make even the stunning scenery of that majestic course look like a cement wall with the way he swings that nine iron. He finished +7 on the day. Which is pretty good for a kid from Gooseneck”   
  
And lastly Agatha Logger, retired mattress sales woman who doubled as the model for advertisements “Mattresses For Somebody” would push out every couple months in the form of fliers. She retired quite young at the age of forty-one thanks to a generous law-suit after a stack of mattresses fell on her during a delivery. She was hospitalized for several weeks after the incident with several broken bones and a case of clinophobia. She is now terrified of mattresses and will only sleep on couches that do not fold out.  
  
This particular group of people was assembled by the one JJ Johnson, a paranoid, aspiring weed farmer who didn’t want to draw any attention to himself by purchasing fertilizer in large amounts. He had a fully fleshed out plan, he would undercut what legal institutions charge by growing the worst weed possible on his farm slightly outside of town and selling it for dirt cheap.   
  


He came upon our trio of unremarkable people at the local institution affectionately named “BAR” one night. The three to-be heist men (and woman) were sitting, chatting about why the NHL should move a team to Gooseneck - a town with a stable population of nine thousand - and why it would be “easy money” for the league. The trio knew each other only as regulars and would often share a pint over some chit chat that was often undetailed and slightly awkward. JJ  approached them, described what he wanted to do and explained that if they could steal him fertilizer - anything general purpose will do - that he would reward them well financially based on how much they were able to procure. They were initially hesitant but with Francis’s unemployment drying up, Rory’s adrenaline at an all time low having given up his pursuit of golf, and Agatha’s lawsuit money winding down - they decided to give er’ a go.   
  
  
Their ambitions were not high, their cause not heroic, but by god, they were gonna pull this off.   
  


The next night Agatha pulled slowly into the Home Depot parking lot - her 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan bumping along with its broken exhaust. Francis, sitting in the back seat, his leg bouncing up and down rapidly, leans forward “You guys still set on this?”. Agatha’s hand hangs partially out the window while a lit cigarette burns between her fingers “Yes, Francis, it’s going to be easy, in and out, If you don’t want to go in the store that’s fine… Me and Rory will take care of that. Just stand watch and take the bags as we hand em’ to ya.” The minivan comes to a stop just outside the Home Depot’s glass double doors. “Alright let’s fucking do this” Says Rory as he hops out the passenger side door. “Hand me the sledge hammer and let’s get this rocking bud!” Francis opens the side door and hands the large sticky (why is it sticky?) hammer to Rory who’s jumping lightly up and down ready to get started.   
  
\*BUMPH\* “Fuck, alright then buddy, wanna play tough eh?” \*BUMPH\* “Fucking hell that ripples right through the hands!” \*BUMPH\* Glass shadders. “Alright WE ARE IN!”. Agatha steps inside with Rory, the smell of lumber greets them. The smell brings back a memory of Rory with his father there when he was just a kid, he quickly shakes it off. The fertilizer sits to the right just inside the door. “I love when things work out easy” says Agatha in a confident voice. Unbeknownst to both Rory and Agatha was that an alarm system should have gone off but thanks to a combination of ADHD and a large hit of the penjamin, the closing supervisor that night had forgotten to engage the alarm after locking up.   
  
The hand off begins, Agatha and Rory pick up bags and deliver them to Francis who stands at the door and loads them into the car. It begins to rain and Francis starts to regret placing himself in the role he accidentally assigned himself. Now that he’s part of the crime anyway, he wishes he was inside. His anxiety is in full effect and every sensation is heightened. A sort of oily smell emits from the pavement as the rain pours down on it and every slight sound makes him jump. “The van’s about all piled up guys! Keep em coming and let’s get outa here alright?” He says through the smashed glass door, hoping they can hear him.   
  
Agatha hands Francis another bag and lights up a cigarette “Look little chub don’t worry so much… Do you see anyone around? We’re A-Okay. Stop sweating so much you look soggy. “It’s not sweat, It’s fucking rain- you know what… alright… whatever… sounds good. Let's just get this done fast please.”  
  
Inside Agatha and Rory lean down to grab a bag at the same time, leading to Rory knocking the cigarette out of Agatha’s hand. It bounces between bags and rests itself below, meeting a particular special bag (Hello Fertilizer, I am Cigarette, lets go on a date) that had been ripped open during delivery. “Where the hell did it go, says Agatha?” “I dont got a fuckin clue but whatever shouldn’t be doing that nonsense any way, grab a bag and lets get outa here...” Rory replies. The two each grab their last bag and step out the door into the rain… \*PLOP\* “There it is,that’s the end of em’…” says Rory. “Hold on just one second gonna grab a chocolate bar for the road.” There is some protest to his untimely need for a kit-kat but it is unacknowledged as he steps back through the doorway. The smell of smoke catching his attention. 

It turns out the cigarette and fertilizer found love, they were a perfect match.   
  
“Ohhhh Fuck…” Rory stands motionless looking at a half emptied skid of fertilizer, flames taking it over quickly, the wooden skid itself also getting in on the action. 

He sprints out of the store slipping and falling on the broken glass, behind a smoke alarm triggers and sprinkles begin to rain down inside The Home Depot. “What the hell did you do!” Agatha shouts, her voice cracking in the process. “What did I do? What did you do! You’re the one that decided to light up a dart inside while we moved literal fuckin fertilizer!”   
“So you’re gonna tell me that - DIRT - is flammable?”  
“I fucking guess I am!   
“You knocked it outa my hand!”  
“Yeah well I bet you knock at your own door to see if someone’s home!”   
  
The Home Depot security camera - which no doubt would become of great interest in the coming hours - catches the full interaction between the two completely reasonable people arguing. Rory’s arms covered in blood with glass shards in it waves frantically around him while Agatha gets in his face like a manager on an umpire after a missed strike three. Francis on the other hand is pacing behind them, phone up to his ear frantically describing something to someone on the other end.  
  
The sound of sirens in the distance catches the attention of Rory and Agatha. Both facing Francis now staring. “What in the hell did you do?” yells Agatha. “I didn’t know what to do, I mean stealing soil... or whatever is one thing, but arson? I had to Agatha, let’s just get out of here fast.”   
  
Soaking wet, Agatha and Rory jump into the minivan and lock the doors. Readying for their dramatic escape. “You’re not coming with us Francis, you called 911! Find your own way outa here!” 



The minivan moves at a snail's pace, slower than molasses, the tires rubbing up against the wheel wells.   
  
“You can’t leave me here!” says Francis, jogging lightly beside the vehicle’s driver side window.  
“Nope not doing it, you’re not getting in.” Agatha says… a cigarette in her left hand hanging outside the partially rolled down window.   
“Cmon’ Agatha, you know I’m no good at running, I’ll never get away!”   
She rolls down the window hoping that it adds to the dramatic effect of what she’s about to say “I said fuck off Francis”   
  
Francis attempts to jump in through the window, his chubby body gets stuck half way, Agatha struggles to navigate, his upper body blocks her view, his ass hanging out the window.   
“Ahhh stop, get out, get out!”   
“You’re not leaving me behind! Ahhhh!” Francis’s legs flailing outside.   
Rory, head in his hands mentally exhausted, looks up to see a Fire Truck followed by a Police Car and  an Ambulance pull into the parking lot. The fire truck heading straight towards The Home Depot while the cop car and ambulance pull over to observe the slowly moving minivan with its rear end sunken down, looking like a terribly designed speed boat.   
  
“Stop right there, it’s over.” The police say over the car’s intercom. Agatha grips the wheel, knuckles white. Her hands move with precision, the trio makes a daring and successful exit, turning feverishly slow out of the lot and onto Lake Road with Francis, still yelling.. and his ass still hanging out the window… and his legs still kicking fratically… 



They make their get-away.   
  
The police car follows. The two officers look at each other confused, hoping the other knows what they are supposed to. “Is that Francis, Agatha and Rory in there?” the passenger side officer says before taking a sip of his coffee. “Holy hell it is hahaha!” Laughs the police officer manning the steering wheel. “I bought a mattress from Agatha back in the day. Me and the ol’ lady still got it, best purchase of my life!”  

  
The months that followed involved a riveting court case in which the jury laughed,cried and easily convicted the unremarkable criminals.   
  
The Home Depot survived with limited fire damage and the security footage was implemented in a detailed training video that supervisors were required to watch involving the importance of the closing checklist.   
  
Agatha was sent to a high end couch-only prison to accommodate her fear of mattresses, where she would meet people with the same fear as her and go on to write the book “Mattress And The Maid”. A horror book promoted mostly on rural bill boards that would go on to be a Canadian Times #1 Best Seller.   
  
Rory would be sent to work at Top Golf down in the city retrieving people and objects that had fallen from the upper deck for three years. Unpaid.  
  
Francis served a lesser sentence - eventually having it expunged - thanks to being an informant and testifying against his contemporaries. He would be offered a slightly less stressful job at the airport where he would be in charge of loading the carrier with baggage. Around this time the town saw an uptick in tourism and commercial planes now commonly flew in to see the deep and vast culture of Gooseneck. His time there would be greatly enjoyed, and he was popular with his co-works for setting the record for losing the most luggage in a week. (That record would later be broken Bobby “No Bags” Bronco)  
  
JJ, the one that put them up to all this - got off scott-free. He never did get his weed farm off the ground and eventually decided that a life of crime wasn’t for him. He instead transitioned into selling time shares to unexpecting people who thought they were getting a free vacation.   
  
When it was all said and done - in a town where not much happens - The unremarkable heist team was spoken about for years after. Gooseneck would eventually dedicate a holiday to these three heroes. On March twenty-second every year, the town gathers at The Home Depot off Lake Road and smokes a celebratory dart. Showing all of the kids growing up in Gooseneck, that yes… Even you, can make history.

1q13ugk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accenture_PH/comments/1q13ugk/creeped_out_at_our_yearend_party/,Creeped Out at Our Year-End Party,"Gusto ko lang i-share yung experience ko sa recent year-end party namin.

This year, the company decided to hold our year-end party outside the office, sa isang bar. Mahilig naman ako uminom from time to time, so I was honestly excited knowing na may inuman yung party.

For context: I’m a gay man (discreet—unless you ask, you wouldn’t really know). I’m also fit since I’ve been consistently going to the gym, and I’d say I’m maybe slightly above average-looking. 

Super excited talaga ako kasi bihira lang kami magkita ng mga workmates ko. Mostly work-from-home kami, iba-iba ng schedule, and minsan iba-iba rin ng site. So this felt like a rare chance to actually socialize.

On the day of the party, I wore a fitted black shirt and denim pants—pang-party lang talaga. Sadly, konti lang yung naka-attend from my direct workmates, pero it was still fun. Nakainuman ko rin yung ibang coworkers na naging close ko kahit ilang months pa lang kami magkakilala. Our boss even ordered extra drinks na hindi na charged sa project, so mas lalo naging masaya yung vibe.

Later that night, may isang workmate from another team sa project na lumapit sakin. Friendly and very sociable siya with everyone, so I didn’t think anything bad would come out of it. He asked me if I had a jowa. I answered honestly and said I have a boyfriend.

After that, biglang nag-iba yung energy. He became more interested and immediately asked what my “position” was. I answered honestly again and said I’m a bottom. That’s when things got uncomfortable.

He started repeatedly asking if I wanted to sleep with him that night. I kept telling him no—that I have a boyfriend and I don’t cheat. Pero he wouldn’t stop. It got worse when he followed me to the bathroom. I got there first and locked myself inside a cubicle. Paglabas ko, nakita ko siyang pumasok din sa CR and telling me to stay. At that point, I was really creeped out.

I kept repeating that I don’t cheat, but I was already uncomfortable and anxious. I ended up typing a note on my phone explaining what was happening and showed it to my boss and some coworkers (all straight, by the way). They immediately stepped in and made sure I was safe and that the guy stayed away from me.

After the party, we went out to drink coffee to decompress. My boss and coworkers checked in on me and asked if I wanted to escalate the situation to HR. While it was a somewhat traumatic experience, I honestly didn’t feel like it was worth the stress and trouble of formally reporting it. He did “just ask,” and there was no physical force involved—though it was still very uncomfortable and inappropriate.

I was genuinely grateful for how my coworkers handled the situation—especially since that was the first time they found out I was gay. Despite everything, it meant a lot to feel protected and supported.

Still, nakakabigla lang na nangyari yun sa isang work event. I didn’t expect to feel unsafe in a space that was supposed to be fun and professional.",12,1767272948.0,Accenture_PH,4,1.0,False

Brother has completed MBBS and is currently preparing for PG NEET (I’ll have to support his MD fees in the future)

Current situation:

I live in Bangalore in a rented house (₹25k/month rent)
My mother lives in our hometown in a very old ancestral house
I work as a software engineer
I also earn ~₹8 LPA from agriculture (arecanut + coffee), which should increase to ~₹15 LPA in the next few years as more acreage starts yielding
I have invested ~₹60 lakhs in Indian equities
My long-term goal is to build a ₹2 crore portfolio in the next 4–5 years through disciplined investing


The issue: 

Recently, a marriage proposal was rejected because our house in the hometown is very old. After this, my family has started pressuring me to construct a new house.


My dilemma:
Since I’m the only earner, constructing a new house now would put a big financial strain on me
I also want to continue focusing on investments and wealth creation
Additionally, I need to be financially prepared for my brother’s MD fees

Construct a new house now to avoid further marriage rejections, or
Postpone marriage for 2–3 years, continue investing, stabilize finances, and then build the house

Not only was it used before, it will also probably stay longer because coffee is more sensitive to climate changes. And don’t even get me started on the health benefits: better sleep, less anxiety, less addictive, and easier on the stomach.

Also, as far as I know, people consume twice as much tea as coffee worldwide. But still, tea comes to many people as second to coffee, being perceived as something you drink only when you’re sick or at your grandma’s house.

I assume it has to do with the way tea is branded, marketed, and viewed in modern society compared to coffee.

My question is quite simple - is it IBS or not? I am of course familiar with Rome and other things and yet I am still very confused, so I'd rather hear it directly from people on this sub.

Bottom line: my gut/stomach has never been OK with various discomforts at all times. However, here's the thing that bothers me: in the last few years I had a several flare ups that lasted for 7-14 days.

Today is one of those flare ups which already lasts for 7 days and the last one was I think more than a year ago.

My current symptoms: constant feel that I need to go to the bathroom, pressure in the stomach (no bloating), some gas (no bad smell), some burp, and not so great stool, desire to go intensifies greatly after food and small amount of poop comes out, bristol 5 or 6. This feeling is 24/7 regardless of what I eat (I currently only eat only chicken and rice).

I believe it was triggered by consuming an alcoholic beverage I am not used to (a bottle of Fireball, 250ml 3 evenings in a row - on the 4th evening this whole thing started). Otherwise I only drink dry red wine every week - it was my first time trying Fireball.

Last flare up that happened more than a year ago was caused by consuming marinated garlic.

My main question would be the following:

1. Outside of these periods that happened 2-3 times in the last 2 years, I eat everything. Salty, spicy, sour, etc - any kind of food. I never have any serious discomfort.
2. At the same time, these flare ups still DO happen somehow (even if it's rare - it is still very annoying because it's 24/7 and lasts for 1-2 weeks usually)
3. I drink 3-4 black coffees every day, I eat pastry some times, gluten, jalapeno, pickles, red meat, greasy fish - literally everything and I do not feel bad outside of these periods that still somehow happen.

I understand that according to the Rome it does not qualify for IBS - however, all the symptoms are IBS-like one-to-one.

Do you think it is realistic to cause a functional flare up that lasts for 1-2 weeks by introducing something unusual to the diet (Fireball in this case), CONSIDERING the fact that I consume literally all food without any serious issues?..

So, our first was delivered by emergency c-section at 29 weeks 1 day, and spent 2.5 months in the NICU. We discovered immediately after release that he LOVED classical music and anything related. He's also neuro-atypical with a language processing disorder and is probably on the autism spectrum (he'll be getting evaluated this coming year).

His life pretty much revolved around music from the get-go and he spent a LOT of time watching orchestral performances on YT along with opera and ballet. He'd typically climb onto the coffee table and conduct along with the performances, mimicking the conductor, and oftentimes when he was playing alone he'd continue with this behavior. Essentially, classical music and related wound him up when he was feeling good and calmed him down when he wasn't. So, we discovered Preschool Prodigies, got him a set of desk bells, and started him out with that. He LOVED it!

His sister came along about 2.5 years after he was born, and while she wasn't nearly as, I'll say obsessed, with classical music, she also enjoyed it and participated in PP quite a bit. Fast forward about 4 years and the kids had a few basic instruments around the house (there's some musical background in both parents' families, and some other artistic pursuits, btw). Then something happened, that I can't quite recall, and my wife said off-handedly one night: ""I think \[daughter\] might have perfect pitch."" Shortly after she found a pitch-testing app online and tested her out. Results were 90-100% accurate at about 4yo. We tested her older brother shortly after and discovered basically the same.

4 years later and both the kids have been taking lessons for a few years using Yousician and weekly in-person lessons for: guitar, bass guitar, piano, drums, and they do ukulele and mandolin mostly on their own. (For context, wife and I had decided early on that learning an instrument, minimum, would be a requirement for the kids. Obviously, our single-instrument rule was insufficient for the kids.)

I believe that somewhere along the lines we had heard that kids can develop perfect pitch watching Preschool Prodigies (possibly from an interview that Mr. Rob did?). I'm curious what other people's experiences have been with it?? I can say that living with two people with perfect pitch can get weird at times... ""What's that song that starts with a repeating D and ends with \[some chord progression\]?"" ""What's making that noise? It's a C."" They also make for a fun party trick.",1,1767272322.0,perfectpitchgang,0,1.0,False

It’s a fantastic bag - well constructed, looks great, super functional. I bought it to be my “everything bag” as aside from my daily commute across London, I sometimes need to travel for work either on a plane or Eurostar. 

But at 24L I’m finding it’s just a bit big to be my EDC. I don’t have a tonne of stuff and so it’s at most half full every day. I am only ever really carrying: an iPad, a coffee flask, a small umbrella, occasionally a gym tee and shorts which I can usually put in my 8L race pack.

But because I’ve spent £250 on the CPP2 I’m finding it a struggle to shell out again on a smaller EDC and feel guilty about the idea of not using it daily having made the purchase.  

Can you guys help me with this dilemma about whether I should bite the bullet and get a smaller  EDC, or whether I should just make the CPP2 fit? How do you cope with owning many bags?

Thanks!

Woke up to 100% phone battery and zero motivation. Rare alignment of the universe.

Checked WhatsApp. Family groups already sending good morning photos like it’s a competitive sport. Replied to none. Let them wonder.

Opened notes app to write “2026 goals”. Typed the date. Closed the app. Too much pressure.

Went out to buy milk. Zepto showed surge pricing. For milk. Walked instead like an independent adult with principles and weak calves.

Came back, made coffee, drank it slowly, standing, staring at nothing. This is my version of meditation. Or dissociation. Hard to tell.

By afternoon, phone battery was at 23%. I had done nothing. Somehow felt tired.
New year feels exactly like old year, just wearing a fresh calendar.

Woke up on Jan 1st and my room looked at me like, “So… what’s the plan this year?”
I looked back like, “First let me sit.”

Decided to clean because new year illusion. Picked up an old sock, tried to remember where the other one is. That sock has been missing since 2023. Maybe it moved abroad. Respect.

Went to the kitchen. Gas cylinder was empty. Perfect timing. Made coffee with maximum optimism and minimum ingredients. Drank it standing, staring at the sink, thinking about nothing and everything. Office pantry suddenly felt premium.

Sat on the bed and scrolled LinkedIn. Everyone was “grateful”, “humbled”, and “excited to announce”. I muted three people and felt spiritually lighter.

Opened my laptop out of habit. No mails. No Slack. Closed it immediately like I touched something hot.

Around afternoon, landlord messaged “Happy New Year” and immediately followed with “rent reminder”. Consistency is important in relationships.

Ordered food. Delivery guy called from downstairs. I said “coming” and took exactly two minutes to mentally prepare for eye contact. Came back, ate silently, watched one episode of something I’ve already watched before.

Now it’s evening. The house is quiet. I’m quiet. Nothing big happened. No plot twist. Just me, a missing sock, and the strong feeling that Jan 1st is just Sunday wearing new clothes.

Can you be honest, how many Sleep Token friends have you made on subreddits for friends? 

That's a mixed-result answer and I did make somewhat a handful, obviously that doesn't go without negative dms request though which you could've guessed what the dms request said 💀 However, there have been a handful of blocks on Reddit from dms messages telling me that Sleep Token is either.


Decent, terrible, not good and there are better bands than Sleep Token. Yeah, what did you think I would do? Respond and fight back? Yeah, sorry but I'm not interested in putting my energy where it's negative and going into an endless debate war over why I enjoy Sleep Token and why you're tone deaf 💚🩷🌸🦩

Yeah, I understand that Sleep Token is hard to understand for most people to enjoy if you don't enjoy this in a vocalist. Ethereal sounding vocals, emotional raw karaoke vocals, some of the lyrics in their song are REALLY sad and devastating, that's just how I enjoy my lyrics. However, if you can't tolerate my hyper-fixations and if you can't tolerate me being repetitive either, then this post is a waste of your time/with my other 📌 post on my bio 💀

Yeah, I'm just ASKING for you to tolerate my hyper-fixations and by all means I'm not implying that you've to listen to Sleep Token. However, not allowing me to text about Sleep Token isn't for me anymore. The thing is, I'm just tired of being told to be quiet about something, it's something that is VERY common in real-life and let's just go on with why I've chosen to do 3 bios in one post for now.

However, before we start on why I'm turned away from Nintendo/Nintendo Switch 2 and why I say Nintendo doesn't have the heart anymore, there are some things you should understand with this post. post. There are three different bio versions that I thought could be fun/add an adventurous twist. 

Yeah, I thought I could challenge myself to see if I can honestly make three different variations of bios just to see what I could create. However, with these bios you will be seeing a lot of repetitive words and if that wasn't obvious enough from the way I'd type that I'm being way too repetitive, Yeah, I'd understand I'm overlapping my words with repeated words and phrases. That's not because I'm trying to make this difficult to read. If you feel the need to feel triggered, because I say things repeatedly that's fine. It's nothing new.

Yeah, I've been told  in real-life to shut up a lot about my hyper-fixations and I need to learn how to be quiet.

To be quite fair and honest it's a huge reason why I'm half mute/70 percent mute which in the other pinned post on my bio will go more into the nasty side of things in my life without giving too much revealing personal identifying information.

This bio will go into detail about all my hobbies, interests, what I'm looking for and this will cover the financial things. Several Reddit users want to know why I can't fly out anywhere to see them, pay for my own plane ticket and things that are similar to related to financial problems that will again, not go over personal identifying information. However, without that out of the way we can discuss why I said the things that I said yesterday about Nintendo.

Yeah, I don't understand why the CEO of Nintendo is defending the game keycards as their life is depending on this defence and it's honestly the most 1 thing I cannot understand  as a video gamer, obviously why a video game company would do this kind of thing.

Yeah, why would Nintendo make game keycards and let alone repackage Breath of the Wild for $70 for the Nintendo Switch 2, obviously that is the quickest milk cash-grab I've ever seen a game company do Yeah, I couldn't even barely see the difference vs the regular Nintendo Switch Breath of the Wild, unless Nintendo wanted you to buy an upscaled T.V. to notice the enhancements,

My T.V. only goes to 1080HD and if Nintendo wants me to buy a 4K T.V. just to see the ''enhanced.'' version of Breath of the Wild 2, then alright Nintendo 🤣 Yeah, what's even more funnier is Nintendo is getting Tales remasters out as fast as possible and the frame rate/graphics are not even impressive for a remaster? Yeah, it's impressive to have a remaster that was only exclusive for Sony consoles. However, can you take the time to make the remasters nice?

What's the graphic difference and the devs are super funny hyping the 30 frame rates 🤣 Yeah, devs hype up the game for the 30 frame rates on a Nintendo Switch console 🤣 Yeah, another reason why I'm not buying a Nintendo Switch 2. However, that's not the reason why I'm not buying a Nintendo 2 and the chances are SUPER high that I won't buy one and that's because of these reasons.

Yeah, I'm confused how Nintendo could ruin Mario Kart World Tour and even talked about the hype for the Nintendo Switch 2 release group friend chat that made me feel singled out, however there were only 1 of the friends that didn't give me the silent treatment and decided not to thumbs down my group chat in a text message.  

Yeah, obviously there was no need to remove paraglider options and you can't even select your own wheels you want when picking your paraglider options with the wheels? Yeah, I'd understand  that in Double Dash that you couldn't pick what you wanted but I don't hate that game. However, that was my favorite thing in Mario Kart 8. However, that's not my main issue, the issue is.

There are barely any koopa kids, which means the koopa kids will be released with a $20-25-dlc pack and I told the group chat in a text, obviously I'm not paying that. The person in the group chat I was chatting with told me just go get you a credit card and did you know that some credit card companies accept social security income and then I said getting a credit card just to pay off a video game sounds wild to me/I'm not doing that 💀

Even then, obviously I told the group chat in a text that I'm never buying Mario Kart World Tour and there is nothing wrong with playing Mario Kart 8 World Tour. Yeah, funny in the group text chat 1-person didn't say anything in the group chat with a group of friends and then the others gave me 👎

(Yeah, the other two friends didn't.) 

The other two friends tried to persuade me that I will spend money when a new Animal Crossing is released on Nintendo Switch 2 and then I will be interested in buying the Nintendo Switch 2 console. If there, there is a limited edition bundle set with a limited edition designed Animal Crossing system.

Yeah, they didn't know what to say to be honest when I told them that if a Kingdom Hearts 4 limited edition console came out for the Nintendo Switch 2 that would be a huge selling point and I will not purchase a limited edition Animal Crossing Nintendo Switch 2 bundle. 

Yeah, however IF PS5 or Xbox One received the limited edition then I would be buying the PS5 and maybe the Xbox One.
To be fair I understand that most of us in our 30s here will be 60-70 years old before anything new announces for Kingdom Hearts 4 and yeah people can still message me here if you're in your early 20s/mid 20s, obviously when Kingdom Hearts 4 gets any updates you will be 50-60
 
Yeah, with this post ending my video game group circle of online friends is a lot smaller than my Sleep Token friends that are somewhat growing/with mixed-results. 

However, my only online video game circle are funny drama queens.  Yeah, one of them said what are you going to do if Nintendo Switch closes down online services and forces others to buy the Nintendo Switch   Yeah, I told them, obviously that's never going to happen do you understand how this will gravely hurt Nintendo's business sales  

Just if you want something REALLY funny out of the few people in the group text at least one of them wasn't a drama queen and said that they regret hastily buying the Nintendo Switch 2 all because of Mario Kart World Tour/ 🤣 They wish they would've saved their money and a library expansion for the Nintendo Switch 2 💀

However, enough of that and we should focus on a simple bio.

Warning: long bio post (nothing hidden.)

What is your name and when I add you I want to know what I should call you as a greeting?

Yeah, I've recently decided to come out and announce that I'm a DID system/host and alters that are named E and S, their enjoyment comes from nicknames.

My real life name is for family members call me by my real life name only, my family doesn't even understand why I dye my hair, why I listen to the music I listen to, why I want a lot of hyper-fixation with band merchandise and you expect them to understand my complex Vessel brain, obviously that has to be a joke.

1 of my family members told me once and this is before we cut off contact unless it's a family emergency that psychologist text are inaccurate, obviously what this 1 family member was saying was that you should question your own psychologist and paperwork to question the accuracy because the test is a general test and psychologist test aren't ''official.''

1 of my family members has asked me as well that I shouldn't take my proper adult autistic diagnosis seriously and I should question the accuracy of my report 🤣

However, let's move on and let's talk about Sleep Token to make this bio more less ''is your family okay?'' 💀

Sleep Token is what's keeping me in a needle of the thread, Sleep Token is my current hyper-fixation, happiness and I cannot see myself stopping buying shirts. Even if I were to have 10 shirts one day, I'll still keep collecting the shirt designs that speak to me and the rare limited numbered merchandise as well.

Yeah, which I looked into yesterday no on Splatoon 3 if your Grizzco work rank is lower than mine, you can't level up your work rank and you can still receive the capsule rewards though, obviously your fish scales as well. My level in Grizzo is.

Profreshional only and I've reached Profreshional+2 is the highest I ever reached on Grizzco rank.

Haven't completed all the story modes, but I want to. However, I'm down to play whatever you want though even if it's just 30 minutes of Turf Wars and 30 minutes of Main Lobby.

Just know on Salmon Run and if you see me on Profreshional playing with you and I don't know how to use the sniper weapons, that's because I don't use those and I'm close to a noob how to use one 💀

Yeah, I'm not the only one on Profreshional rank that just doesn't knows how to use a sniper weapon as a pro 🤣

Yeah, I've seen one of my squad-team members looked so confused on how to use this weapon 🤣

Yeah, I'm not even a fan of camper style weapons, where you sit, camp and perch yourself high up.

That's not me and my style brand on Splatoon 3.

Yeah, I'd enjoy being mid/fling paint range from someone and honestly having a battle instead of being a camper/perched up somewhere high to splat 🤣

Yeah, I'm not afraid to duke things out with someone on the splat-field and that's okay if want to be an eagle camper style player 💀 To be fair of it all using the sniper isn't an easy weapon for any Splatoon player to use and that's cool-style that you enjoy the sniper weapons.

Yeah, something is more fun being in the middle of combat in the splat-field and seeing who can splat each other first and who is the stronger opponent. Yeah, I'm the thriller kind of Splatoon player 🤣 Bring on the fight and battle this out.

Yeah, 1 of my online friends that I play Splatoon with we normally close out an hour or an hour and a half sometimes on Splatoon. Yeah, sometimes we play 30-45 minutes of Fall Guys as well, then an hour of Splatoon 3 before logging off. Yeah I let my online friend pick what they want to do as I'm not picky and unbothered.

Uh, I don't know what else to cover and maybe fashion styles 😂

Yeah, it would be cool to have online male friends that dress in cozy joggers, cheap alternative clothes style clothes from Walmart, Temu and Amazon 💀 and band t-shirts or graphic shirts of your favorite interest.

Yeah, I'm cheap. I just dress in black joggers and Walmart you can get emo/scene looking joggers or leggings 🤣 then I own 9 Sleep Token shirts, no I'm not joking I'd own 9 Sleep Token shirts and I've already posted them on my pro if you scroll all the way down.

Yeah, then I'd also own 3 Lorna Shore shirts, obviously I will just continue to buy Sleep Token shirts and Lorna Shore shirts.

The next thing I want to buy is a Sleep Token blanket, but those are sold out, VERY hard to find if you see them in stores and the next Sleep Token Shirt I need is a Take Me Back To Eden shirt and a Sleep Token Caramel shirt.

Yeah, I need to also purchase a Sleep Token long sleeve shirt and zip up hoodie if I can find one on sale-second hand that's official.

Yeah, with that being said no you don't have to have alternative tattoos or piercings. If you dye your hair that would be cool/great because I dye my hair and I don't ever plan to stop dying my hair.

Red velvet is next on the top part of my roots, then I'll have plans to dye my hair underneath the roots near the ends will be dark brown and my ends will also be dark brown.

Right now, my hair looks awful 🤣 Dyed my hair dark maroon in the middle of December with dark brown ends and just let's say the dark maroon is fading to a nasty color and way too dark 🤣

Yeah, just not my style currently right now, though I would give that hair color a try as I never dyed my hair dark maroon with brown ends and that will never happen again.

Here are some convo starters in my dms because there are some users that are uncertain what to say and these are just random conversations that you can just randomly put in your dms.

Yeah, these questions are REALLY random, but that's honestly the whole point 🤣

What are your favorite hobbies currently? What video games are you currently playing right now?

What video games would you recommend to me if I enjoy Splatoon 3, Fall Guys, Final Fantasy games and yeah I know there is Kingdom Hearts for the PS4.

Yeah, I found my PS4 recently in December and still works, obviously I need to get more games for the PS4 😂 Yeah, forgotten I've had this console just collecting dust 😂

Here are other random assortment of dms you could jump-start your convos.

Are you a guy that is into artsy things? Are you a guy that loves to cook? Are you a guy that loves to bake? Are you a guy that loves to garden and even enjoy painting?

That's cool, even more cool if I would ever make a guy online friend only of course that would pay paino. What if you could play me Dire Dire Docks?

Last conversation starters that would be a good jump-start would be.

Favorite sandwich toppings? What is your go to sandwich and least favorite sandwich? What is your favorite pizza topping and your least favorite pizza topping? What is your go to gamer snack and energy drink?

Least favorite gamer snack and energy drink that tasted gross/not good and you were hoping would taste good? Yeah, do you enjoy coffee? My coffee style is always iced, teas are always iced tea from Starbucks and hot tea at home.

Yeah, I go to Starbucks every-week in a half because I get a sandwich there, either an iced frappe and sometimes I crave a nice iced tea, obviously that can be expensive if I get that often with the sandwich 🤣

Yeah, I'd enjoy a French vanilla iced coffee from Mcdonadl's and sometimes enjoy an iced Caramel coffee from Mcdonald's, obviously what about you?

Yeah, I don't respond to hi messages, hi and 👋 emoji, obviously I'm quite unsure how to respond to that 🤣

Can we be friends if I listen to other genres of music?

If you're a fan of country or rap music, then I just don't know if we could match unless you would want someone that enjoys Lo-Fi as a second option besides a variety of rock, metal and core genres of music then 🤣

Yeah, if you don't want to hear about Sleep Token every single day and I could be just annoying at times for you, yeah I also do send emojis every few sentences and sometimes just 1 if you're annoyed by emoji usage as well.

Yeah, I know this doesn't help much/to make things better and I'm the type of person that won't give you poor conversations unless you tell me hi and ask a deep introverted person what she's doing every single day.

When my life is basically on a repeat loop with barely doing anything by choice and I don't have what you call a socialized family life by their own choices.

Yeah, I wonder how many people would want to hear someone text every single day. I just go on YT, listen to music and find something to watch on YT.

The next thing I'd do is either go on Pandora and then go YT for music, which I think I'm leaning on YT for music more than Pandora, I then listen to music for a while. Then I go back to YT or gaming.

The next thing I'd is I plan to next month buy Final Fantasy 12 Zodiac age because I've lost the game somewhere and I don't know if I'm going to get a new Nintendo Switch game anytime soon, sorry but band merchandise is more important imo ⭐

However, this is why it's probably best for one of us to pick up the conversation where one of us left off, rather than asking what's up every single day when sht don't change.

The thing is that users from this direct post need to realize as well I've no interest in meeting any of you in person because without going into personal details I live underneath the government rules and government funding to at least barely function and live off once-per month.

Which means in translation I'm too broke to see anyone in person and I also get interrogated by the government if I fly somewhere out of state.

Yeah, I'm not looking for a friend to permanently take care of me, what I'm seeing is just best friends on the internet and just give me a reason to look forward to the next day that I will be happy to receive your phone notifications.

The next comment I want to address is seeing posts that people are tired of being ghosted and disposed of close to a fashion trend and tired of that.

That's the sad thing about society culture now, that once someone no longer has a use for you and they got the conversations they wanted to have with you, it's onto the next person, rinse and repeat.

Why do you say on your posts on subreddits for friendship and other connections that you're looking for future best friends? That's weird you're asking for best friends right away and quickly.

Uh, do you know what the future means? That means far-away from now, obviously if you think we can become best friends in a week then that will be on you and not me and that's because.

Yeah, I no longer ask. Recently I made a friend on Tumblr which I don't use anymore who told me I shouldn't be saying the word bestie when we've been friends for two weeks and I should watch what I say to others. Yeah, don't ask me what their problem was/were, however there are some REALLY creepy people on Tumblr and I left.

Yeah, I left Tumblr after I met a crazy ex-person on there trying to compete with my Discord server, they even removed 4 people from my Discord server that were her spy friends apparently and moved them over to create their server. Yeah, after that I left, because this user had problems. They screenshot my bio on Reddit where I said I had DID and sent that out to my followers on Tumblr.

Yeah, I left. I'm not dealing with nuts and I'm not going to deal with someone that wants to hurt or cause drama for my Discord server.

However, let's move on from Tumblr drama and let's just explain what I mean if you would want to help provide moderation for the Discord server, the Sleep Token subreddit and the FB group I recently created. These rules are super-easy and trust me you won't be having high demands as a moderator in Arcadia.

Yeah, when I mean about helping run a Sleep Token subreddit, I mean just daily maintenance and no I'm not asking the moderators of the subreddit to check every minute of their life on the subreddit. The rules are simple/straight-forward/easy. Just check once or twice a day to check for this content on the subreddit that I've created.

However, you can let me know in a dms if this interests you or not and I think that's better off that way, obviously that is because I don't want you to feel disappointed that you're not interested in help moderating the Sleep Token subreddit community. The thing is, you don't need to be an obsessed or hyper-fixated fan of Sleep Token.

The thing that I'm asking is to make sure nobody is posting spam links, spam content, revealing personal information about the band members' real life names and obsession with the band members taking their masks off in a live show.

That's what I'm asking. If this interests you, then you can message me in a few days and I may/might ask if you want to help moderate the server if I feel confident enough to ask, if you obviously don't ask first.

Version II bio-the not super-pleasant topics to talk about before ending this post.

Yeah, I normally don't go out of my way to find a new band or discover a new band, unless someone tells me about a band to check out and if I'm using Pandora at the time. However, I prefer YT music though and not Pandora, however Pandora does offer to find new bands more in the que/recommendations,

However, that's not my main interest right now to spend money on YT music and Pandora music at the same time.

Yeah, my interest right now is just using my YT channel playlist that I've made instead of paying for membership for either of those apps currently. However, you may have a question on a post that I've made recently with this text. Sibling likes to argue about my music, hates my music, yeah we don't have that strong sibling bond anymore and have been falling apart lately, the sibling connection is close to a standpoint of ""we tolerate each other, even though we obviously annoy each other attitude.""

""We occasionally enjoy each other's company ever so often and not often is preferred.

Yeah, for 🎄 yeah, you guys already know that I've asked for Sleep Token shirts from my sibling (my sibling hates this band that I recently found out but tolerates my hyper-fixations) and I got some cute figures and stuffed animals from my sibling's spouses' family.

Yeah, I'd rather not discuss anything about this further, obviously this is way too dramatic of a response of why someone should hate a band.

My sibling says that.

Sleep Token makes her depression worse, sad sad and how can you listen to these awful lyrics? Yeah, you don't get even more depressed when you listen to this stuff my sibling asked me in the car.

Yeah, I just turned my sibling out in the car and said nothing.

My sibling even kept on skipping their songs on my playlist in the car.

Yeah, that's just extremely disrespectful and rude. Yeah, my sibling we only text 1-once or twice a week and that's all. We just don't have that sibling ''spark anymore.''

Well, I might as well go make a ''suitable playlist next time I visit my sibling and lucky that is super way off from happening.''

The only thing I'm going to add to that playlist is video game remixes and Lo-Fi tracks because I'm not going to put rap music on there and this is just how I'm going to fix things here.

Yeah, speaking of my music style, do I dye my hair and do I stick with the same color of hair dye?

My hair is dyed dark red at the roots and my ends dark brown. Yeah, I've been dying my hair this hair color for this whole year of 2025, as dark reds and browns are what is in my style of what I want to dye my hair color right now.

Yeah, this month though I decided to dye my hair dark maroon black and dark brown on my ends, obviously I'm HATING this color combo, because you can barely see the dark maroon color and the color is fading not in a pretty shade as I would've wanted.

Yeah, in January 2026 I'm going to find a red velvet hair dye and go back to my usual dark brown hair dye that I use for my ends.

Yeah, that's why I look for friendships, other connections online about music and that's because all my family members do is sht on my music and have told me in the past that this is how my music is to them.

This isn't my sibling, these are all my family members that I barely have any contact with unless it's an emergency that they think my music is this style.

My music is devil worshipping as well, summoning the devil, satanic lyrics and 1 of my family members thinks that the lyrics that I enjoy are a vast majority of bands sing how to summon a demon and all metal talks about the grim reaper and death 🤣

Get this, before the vast majority of the family members that I have had a lot of contact with and don't anymore for personal reasons, doesn't think I'm telling the truth 🤣

There is 1 family member thinks that vast majority of metal bands that I listen to are ALL singing about the grim reaper, worshipping the devil and even with proof that 1 family member thinks I'm lying and all metal bands are the grim reapers 🤣

Yeah, obviously does this make sense now why I've nowhere to turn to make new connections besides Reddit and Discord friends 🤣

Am I doing anything on the New Year?

No, maybe just ordering Chinese food or just getting me McDonald's and maybe buying a new Final Fantasy game, I've been missing playing Final Fantasy Zodiac Age and the game is lost, have been looking for the game for a while and I can't find the Final Fantasy game.

Well I'm not going to do anything but sit on my bed like a couch, try to complete the winter event on Fall Guys and maybe do a fast food order on McDonald's 🤣

What's your favorite and least favorite mobile order? Last thing you might ask is why won't you see anyone in person that you text on Reddit/Discord? Weird?

Not weird, I'm too broke being on SSI and the rules that I live in my state. I've to be responsible to pay for the plane ticket as I'm not allowed for others to pay for my plane ticket without getting my SSI in jeopardy and I could have my SSI check revoked.

The only thing I've money for every single month is paying my host home half of rent until I get my own government funding apartment that I've already applied for/got approved (just on a waiting list.) bills, whatever food stamps doesn't cover, band merchandise and video games 🤣

Yeah, I even have 1 online friend that I've been with for years and even told me that the reason why they never saw me for those 5 years is the lack of funds there isn't enough left over each month for a plane ticket.

There was an ex-friend of mine a month ago in November arguing with me that my family shouldn't treat me this way, it's unfair, he doesn't enjoy/like that my family life is toxic and we can't become friends anymore because of this vibe.

Uh, well can I say this for people that want to come in my life?

Yeah, you're never going to meet my family and you're never going to meet me in person unless you're highly interested in paying for your plane ticket, your rent car, guest are only allowed to stay in my apartment whenever I get my apartment either in 2026 in summer/spring and the start of 2027 for three days.

Yeah, the thing is you might reflect back on my post and say your online friend that you've been with for a few years is lying to you that they can't afford a plane ticket and probably doesn't want to admit that they don't want to see you.

Uh, that's false, quite insensitive for you to think that, quite insensitive for you to judge my online friend that I've been with for years that you don't even know and that toxic thinking is something I'm not into inviting in my life.The reason why my online friend that I've been with for a few years can't see me in person is this.

Currently without giving too much identifying personal information, which I will not do and provide is this.

My online friend that I have been friends with for a few years can only have a max of 3k in her bank with my online friend being on SSI (state by state is different, mine only allows 2k.)

With frequent medical bills that only half of my online friend's medical health insurance will pay, my online friend is taking expensive supplements that are helping with their auto-immune-diseases that they they've and taking care of their pets.

Then adding my online friend paying for their own groceries, bills, paying a car bill and trying to find a low income apartment to live in, obviously do you think by this point my online friend has enough money for a plane ticket?

Yeah, even my online friend had to get a part time job because my online friend told me that the only way that they can afford all this now with the rise of the cost of living is if they get a part time job and that even with a part time job they still can't afford a plane ticket. Which, let me say this and this needs to be addressed.

Yeah, I've been dumped in the past for friendships even though the friendships were online and got tired of me being broke and not willing to change to make myself not broke anymore, obviously not living on the government income anymore.

However, my past ex-friends that I met on BlueSky which I no longer have a BlueSky account and my previous forgotten account made announcements and acknowledgement to my post that I'm not going to change my financial lifestyle.

This was made as an acknowledgement in several of my past-posts and several users thought I was lying to them and I was going to change my financial ways of living.

Yeah, once they found out the truth that I wasn't all my friends left me in fall and the start of winter of 2025.

Yeah, don't ask me why people think I'm lying, not being truthful about my situation and why they think I've a high-dishonest rate about me, obviously when I've been too honest without giving personal identifying information and people won't waste their time on me.

However, I don't think that's in the right of me to tell my friend this.

''Goodbye, I guess I'll never see you because you've chosen your own living expenses over seeing me which has been a few years now and I guess you will never see me, end the text with a block.''

Yeah, I'm not doing that, I'm just like Brooke and I can't even afford a plane ticket to go see my online friend, obviously why would I do this to someone in the same situation as me?

That's just as bad as telling a friend you've been with for a few years that suddenly got a life-long illness, lost the ability to afford to go see you, lost the ability to only afford living expenses and medical care ''then you will say, this isn't for me and goodbye.''

Yeah, what you're saying and telling that person while dumping them is that you cannot handle this.

Yeahh, you've deep problems holding an online friendship unless it's frequent meetups and you cannot be broke.

If you do somehow and something might happen in real life where you might become too broke in your later-years of life, then our friendship that we had been going for a while now is meaningless is what I felt getting dumped and removed from past-friendships and connections.

Here are the other bands that I enjoy.

Tips for messaging me in chat requests if you're uinsure.

However, let's end this on a positive note. If you don't know how to start your chat requests because you're too shy then maybe you can tell me your favorite pizza topping and least favorite pizza topping?

Yeah, you can also tell me your favorite sandwich topping and least favorite pizza toppings? Yeah, you can even let me know your favorite 🎄 or New Year's dish and even your favorite seasonal dish.

How do you enjoy your coffee? Favorite type of pasta dish, favorite energy drink and snacks when video gaming?

Yeah, for me I normally get Mcdonald's iced French vanilla coffee or caramel iced coffee twice a week. Starbucks I'd sometimes only buy something from Starbucks every week and a half or two because it's pricey because I love to have the iced teas and a nice VERY sweet frappe with one of their sandwiches.

Coffee at the house?

No, not often unless instant and I will be brewing a nice caffeine or caffeine tea every single day.

If that doesn't work you can let me know what games you're looking forward to next year in 2026 and what game you're currently playing right now.

Just let me know your favorite hobbies, interests and you can even give me a mini-bio packed of what you're into right now and you don't have to worry about being basic. Yeah, as long as you don't say hi/hello then you're fine.

Yeah, let's just text about life, your hobbies, interests, I want to know what makes you happy and just as much as I'm happy when you tickle my Vessel brain. Yeah, I'm looking forward to messaging you and if you're in your 20s, that's fine.",1,1767271400.0,u_Competitive_Creme510,0,1.0,False

Extremely poor mental health compounded by questions of faith is there anyone Cork based you would recommend? just someone who wants to grab a coffee. I am seeing a EBT specialist and getting on antidepressants but I'm going downhill.

For context, when I was in my late teens I found Hitchens Dawkins and other literature that led to me leaning toward atheism. I was carefree in UCC and so much happier then studying reading societies being in the gym consistently and having a gf. When I was in my last year of college I started to get curious about the question of God again but started getting huge anxiety and panic over religion and belief and hell. I had a girlfriend at the time, the loveliest person in the world I have never felt what I feel for her for anyone else. Eventually, my anxiety over religion led me to break up with her I was in such a bad place and didn't want to bring her down with me. I had a breakdown emotionallly I couldn't have had her go through what I went through it was distressing her enough.

I promised her when I broke up with that I would seek to answer the religion question that had she knew had been plaguing me in months previous.

Since then, I have failed her. I haven't read religious texts nor taken a course nor watched any vids due to the effect on me and so I've numbed myself with vices and food, working insane hours and fishing through each weekend. I miss her so much and I've wasted every minute since I broke up with her.

I've essentially wasted the last two or three years of my life (prime years 24-27) and now I just turned 27 and this realisation has hit me like a truck. I feel not knowing if I believe/what I believe has paralysed me. I'm going nowhere in life I've no friends and these questions are crushing me for some reason.

The reason I haven't done this is once I started thinking about the God question I have had breakdowns. I have spent weeks sweating in bed but being unable to sleep, I have had eating issues, and recently has been such a struggle.

I can't move forward with a relationship until I know what I believe and I don't know that I don't want to waste another person's time. I can't move forward with answering the religion question either due to fear.

My family are not religious and going to certain religions would upend my life. My mental health has been really poor over this and other matters to the point I have cut myself with a fishing knife a number of times this year.

I'm horrified I will make a decision on what faith to follow which will completely upend my life only to feel years down the line I was wrong. I'm scared I will grow old without kids or marriage. If it wasn't for my parents being around, and what it would do to them, 'm scared of what I would do. I'm afraid I'll look at the break up with a woman who truly loved me and regret this all. I miss her so much I look back on old photos of us and bawl I loved her so much and haven't lifted a finger to answer the question of God, which led to us breaking up (not the question, but the fact I didn't want her to be around me breaking down). I'm afraid I'll be unmarried and childless a disappointment to my parents and just kill myself at the end.

This is last chance saloon but can anyone give me some advice experience on what to do. Anyone that can be recommended to talk to in Cork? Or if anyone wants a coffee. I've always struggled to make friends so this has really compounded things.

I'm afraid of getting to 35-40 lonely and childless and then killing myself because I can't answer if I believe or not, or what I believe, despite everyone around me managing to do so. I haven't been able to get out of bed for days. I just want it to stop.

I'm so sorry if reading this is a blight on your day. Again, if anyone wants to grab a coffee on me I'd love to do so. Please I'm sick of starving, crying and cutting. Work is the only thing I have in life",0,1767270852.0,cork,8,0.47,False

The plan was to read… just read. Like I usually do. I wanted to see if I could hit 50 books again — my regular range for the last five years.

I usually read around 40–50 books a year. In 2025, that number crept up to 90.

What surprised me more wasn’t the count, but how reviewing became part of my reading. I left 81 freaking reviews after that. Written right after finishing the book.

A part of the reason was the introduction to the indie author community. Fresh recommendations kept coming, far from the influencer hype. And I was requesting Advanced Reader Copies (ARCs) regularly.

Once ARCs became a regular part of my reading, reviewing came with expectations. So, I wasn’t just reading more; I was reviewing more.

This is what worked for me...
- Taking notes while reading (first impressions, thoughts, reactions)  
- Highlighting quotes/passages for easy reference later  
- Drafting reviews using notes + highlights immediately after finishing  
- Tracking review requests/outreach in a sheet  
- Setting personal deadlines for ARC reviews  
- Keeping an eye on page counts to avoid overwhelm  
- Spacing out similar themes to prevent genre fatigue  

Goodreads has been my central logging platform. But for the books I connected with the most, I often cross-posted reviews on other reader-focused spaces as well.

Following are my rare 5-star reads... the handful of books that really stayed with me...
- Bailing Out, by Leonard Ruhl
- Sweets and Sycamores, by Arianne Nicks
- The Trees Sing, by Rishikesh Lokapure
- My Friends, by Fredrik Backman
- The Sundered Stars, by H.E. Bauman
- Minor Detail, by Adania Shibli
- Blackthorn, by Emily Eve
- The Little Coffee Shop of Kabul, by Deborah Rodriguez
- When Death Gives You Lemons, by Alice G. Brooks

She has always been one of those people who needs everything to be absolutely perfect. It was exhausting growing up with her but shes my only sibling so I always made excuses for her behavior even when she hurt me

When she asked me and my daughter who is 4 to be in the wedding party back in February I was nervous. I knew she was going to be a massive bridezilla. But I agreed because shes my sister and my daughter was so excited to be a flower girl

Over the next few months we practiced dances, bought expensive dresses and put up with her constant tantrums about everything. I told her from the start that if she was ever nasty to my child I wouldnt stand for it. She promised she would never be mean to her quote favourite person in the whole world

Then her husbands little cousin who is around 8 started coming to dance practices. My sister started having her show my daughter how to do things. I thought maybe she was going to have two flower girls which would be fine. But then she started making my daughter sit out while the other girl practiced her parts

I took her out for coffee a few weeks before the wedding and asked her what was going on. She said she was glad I brought it up because she had been looking for the right time to tell me. She said my 4 year old wasnt doing everything right and she was afraid she would mess up her vision by saying the wrong thing or not doing the dance perfectly

I told her everyone always praised how well my daughter was doing. She laughed and said its not their day is it so its not up to us whats good enough for her wedding. I asked her straight up if she was saying her own niece wasnt good enough. She said not for something as big as flower girl but she could still attend as a guest

I asked how I was supposed to break this to my daughter who had been practicing for months and was so excited. She just said figure it out
I told her she had one day to change her mind or we wouldnt be attending and I wouldnt be speaking to her again. Two days passed with nothing
I had to tell my daughter she wasnt going to be in the wedding anymore. I tried to sugarcoat it as much as possible but she still cried herself to sleep. So did I.
 So did my husband

When I stopped showing up to anything my sister started panicking. She got family members to reach out to me and even sent gifts for my daughter. When I told them why we werent coming a good number of family members including some bridesmaids dropped out too

We ended up taking a trip with no phones for a few weeks. When we came back my sister had sent multiple letters and emails apologizing. Her husband and in laws have been calling me an asshole for what I did. They say I ruined her wedding over a child not getting her way

I’m 24M, tech job, Bangalore. My lifestyle is very dramatic if you enjoy:  
quiet cafés, long walks, judging menus, and laughing at random things like why every nice place has “waiting time: 40 mins”.

I don’t drink, don’t club, vegetarian, and loud pubs make me stand in one corner thinking about life choices. If fun for you = talking, laughing, and existing peacefully — congrats, we’re already compatible citizens.

Dating apps? Absolute comedy show.  
You match.  
You talk.  
You vibe.  
Then suddenly they disappear like autos after saying “coming madam”.  
At this point I think apps are just character development.

So I’m trying honesty + humour here.  
I’m actually looking to **date**. Not situationship, not confusion, not “let’s see” for 6 months. Just two normal humans talking, laughing, meeting, and seeing if something clicks.

What you’ll get with me:  
– Calm energy  
– Dry humour (sometimes unintentionally funny)  
– Will listen to you properly  
– Will walk with you without checking phone  
– Emotionally available but not emotionally exhausting

Bonus:  
I will hype you up, share food, and pretend not to notice if you steal fries.

If you’re a girl reading this and laughing a little too much — hi.  
This post was written **specifically for you**, not the whole internet.

No pressure. No expectations.  
If you feel like talking, message. Worst case: one fun chat.  
Best case: coffee, walks, and mutual “how did we even meet like this?” stories.

1q13493,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalroad/comments/1q13493/2026_the_cat_and_you/,"2026, the Cat and you!","Happy New Year everyone! 😸

It is I, the Cat, and you've just been isekaid into another one of my threads! Now there is no escape until you upvote and comment. Yes, coercion, that's how we've been keeping humans in line for the past thousand years.

But, while you're here, let's talk about ''2026, the Cat and you''

(not a propaganda post, despite the title telling you otherwise)

**Very brief background info:**

Hey there, I'm Squitt3n, the Discord Cat and I'm the one who writes the modestly mediocre and mildly adequate *Dungeon Broker*. I also sometimes write guides here on reddit and offer advice to new authors. I'm a hyperactive rebel and I funnel the excess energy into writing, while at the same time feeling too lazy to do anything.

Around the end of 2025, my health situation had changed a bit, putting me into a position where I'll have more free time than a person reasonably should, while still keeping my job and working on the weekends. I don't know how long this will last, but to the end of 2026 is a pretty safe bet.

So, while existing in this weird limbo for the last two months or so, the Cat got to thinking. It went something like this:

''I wanna be a mighty pirate!'' 🏴‍☠️

And then the realization that ships are too expensive sunk in, pulled by the cruel gravity of bank account. It is at that point that I finally put two and two together, figuring that 'Infinite free time' + 'Writing like it is a fulltime job' + 'KU pipeline for 2027' = 'Money for a pirate ship'

**So this was all a way to tell us that you will be writing a ton of books in 2026?**

Basically, yes, but it sounded more exciting above!

**Ok, how many books?**

You know that part where you make a plan and then it nosedives completely?

Well, the Cat's plan was to write a book a month, with cheating! Realistically, it will be one in like two months or more, but let's not crush ideas just yet.

**Cheating?**

Yes, I am cheating, of course!

It isn't a bunch of books out of nowhere. That might be too much. Some are former projects being reworked, wrapped up, and shipped. So, the first fiction coming out on the 2nd of March is the Cat's actual first attempt at LitRPG, before the *Dungeon Broker*, and yes, it is hard to read in its current form, it is 'kitten's first LitRPG idea' but heavily reworked. 😹

We're pressing as if writing is a full time job, as that is the ultimate goal anyway! And by we, I mean myself and my partner, Cat 2, who I totally haven't coerced into helping me out with editing and dictation cleanup. 😹 Yes, my ''ummm'' and ''eeeeh'' and even a few ''oooh what the fuck do I know, fucking...the goblin flipped him off and...ppffffffuck, I need my coffee.'' are now someone else's problem!

Cat 2 writes grimdark, I write comedy. Yea, this will go well, I can already see it 😹☠

To put it simply, it is a 'book per month' but with a lot of work already done ahead of time. I'm expecting to run out of previous works around the end of Q1 2026, then we'll see if the 'book a month' actually works.

The planned length is around a 100k words, both to not overdue it and to keep later editing costs reasonable.

**That seems like a very aggressive schedule!**

Yes, and I wouldn't recommend it!

I'm following my own school of thought, which is 'If you want something to work, you need to approach it as if it were your full time job.'. It doesn't work for everyone and it takes quite a toll, mentally, physically and emotionally, especially because world doesn't stop moving just because you've decided to dedicate your time elsewhere. If you're not used to doing things this way, I would heavily advise against it without at least a few weeks of warmup and testing out the waters. The Cats have been in this state for years with other projects, so we're used to it by now, but it isn't healthy.

The second thing is following Seth Ring's advice on writing and the necessary output to make writing your full time job. I highly recommend that you check out his channel, especially if you want to pursue a career in writing. Note that I can only take his word on what works and what doesn't, as I'm trying out his advice for the first time.

**A bit about process:**

This is just how I do things, maybe it can help out some other authors too.

Outline the whole book - Write first 10 chapters to get a feeling for the world/characters/system - Dictate the rest - Dictation cleanup (Cat 2's job) - Editing - Re-writing and wrapping it up.

I don't believe that the planned tempo and output would be possible without dictation. You talk much faster than you write, but dictation takes a lot of practice and getting used to. I'm by no means an expert in it, I still ramble and make a lot of mistakes, so cleanup and editing take forever.

**Updates, guides and such!**

I'm thinking of making monthly updates here, writing about progress, things that did/didn't work out and lessons learned along the way. I think that will be a good source of info for new writers, we'll see.

Sadly, no vlogs, no YouTube channel 😹 The Cat has too much anxiety to be on camera, and Cat 2 has his own channel to run, so I don't think this will be happening. Would be cool, but I highly doubt it.

**Exciting! What's first on the line?**

Ok, time to roll up my sleeves!

*The Dungeon Broker* is in its penultimate arc. It has been fully edited and releases are continuing next week. Holidays took their toll. There are at least two more books *planned* for it, but the release schedule post-book 1 will slow down to prioritize other projects.

*Max Level Peasant*, a working title, is releasing on the **2nd of March!** Book 1 is in re-writing now, it is the first book the Cat wrote in LitRPG genre, and there's a lot to fix here. Like I've said, kitten's scriblings, which I need to turn into something epic! I'm also looking at the option of a custom cover for this one 😸

There might be delays with completion as I'll soon be in the middle of moving. 😹

It shouldn't take too long to finish as there's already a lot for way back when. If all goes as planned, work on Book 2 should start at the end of January or early February. When will it launch? No idea, depends on Book 1 schedule, but it should be out on Patreon shortly after Book 1 releases.

*Oui Oui, Mon Ami* is the 3rd project, one I've had scheduled for Launchapalooza, but life took a nosedive so it was put on the backburner. I still want to push it out, we'll see if the schedule allows it.

The book follows a 90s action movie star, Maximum Magnum, who dies on set and is reincarnated as a sentient gun wielding croissant in a world where the French revolution was hijacked by cyborgs.

**Can I go now?**

Yes, and thank you for listening to my rambling 😹 I will update you at the end of January/start of February! 😸",2,1767270440.0,royalroad,0,1.0,False

1q131c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1q131c2/my_66_year_old_father_sleeps_only_34_hours_a/,My 66 year old father sleeps only 3-4 hours a night MAXIMUM (this has gone on for years),"First off I would like to wish everyone a Happy new year everyone! As we know, with a new year comes new year’s resolutions. A major resolution of mine is to take note of my health and the health of my parents who are on their 60s. My father is 66 years old, mildly overweight, has high blood pressure, and a few other health problems. My cause for concern is for years now, my father has only been sleeping 3-4 hours a night, 4-5 hours is very rare. I’ve noticed significant changes in his mood, he’s retired and spends most of his day on his iphone glued to the couch. For most of his life he was an avid gym enthusiast working out and boxing multiple times a day, he always was in top shape and his mind was sharp as a tack. During the pandemic, he caught Covid and almost died, he developed major blood clots in his lungs and his health took a major turn for the worse durring late 2020 and onward. By the grace of god he recovered and Im thankful for everyday I get to spend with him on this earth. 

So, to get to my main concern, since his bout with covid his sleep schedule has been a constant issue that worries me greatly. He tends to knock around around 1:30-2 am most night and then wakes up at 5am- 6 am the latest(and rarely, it’s usually 5-5:30 am). Once he’s awake he immediately orders a coffee and some food from dunkin donuts and is back to being glued to the blue lit iPhone screen for the rest of the day. 

I’ve noticed he’s seemed a lot more spaced out durring conversation, if I sit down durring the day to show him a video on the tv, he’ll begin nodding off and snoring within a minute or two. The funny part is, once I get up and turn the video off, he’ll wake back and he’s right back to engaging on X (twitter) or scrolling through instagram reels. He also seems a lot crankier these days, quick to anger if you try to argue a point, very impatient, and has begun having a lot of “senior moments” where he mixes words up or dates up. 

I love my father to death, he’s my best friend and I want him to be around to see his only child get married and have grandchildren. I never had grandfathers growing up, they both died before I was born and I always thought if I had kids they’d be blessed to have my dad in their life. I hope this wasn’t too long but I appreciate any feedback. I always try and show my pops articles on how important sleep is but it usually goes in one ear and out the other. Once again, I appreciate your time and I look forward to getting any feed back. Thank you :\]",5,1767270154.0,sleep,3,1.0,False
1q131bp,https://i.redd.it/l23gcn1zcqag1.jpeg,Finally found a reliable way to buy great specialty coffee,"I live in an area with very limited access to specialty coffee, and ordering from roasters usually means dealing with high shipping costs, import fees, etc.

I recently discovered Hyunah Coffee in Brooklyn through one of Brian Quan’s videos, and it’s been a total game changer. It’s a physical coffee clubhouse in NYC, but for those of us who aren’t local, they offer a $2/month online membership that gives you access to their shop. They curate an incredible selection of coffees that are very hard to source individually - like DAK, Datura, Luminous, and Aviary. If you’re into this side of specialty coffee, I highly recommend checking it out.

Huge shout-out to the owner Hafiz. He’s a massive coffee nerd who genuinely wants to make world-class coffee more accessible. He’s super responsive and clearly cares a lot about the experience.

Positives

I get to take hot showers without budgeting energy and fatigue.

I am able spend more time outside when weather permits such as no rain/snow and heavy winds.

If I start to get hot then I can lose some layers as I often find myself in jeans and heavy cotton tee in +33F temps.

Negative

The cold somehow shrinks my bladder so I piss way too much. My coffee, water, and soda intake has not increased but decreased because I am not hot. Hell I haven’t even had my favorite Captain and Coke Zero since July (I think).

Well no matter what I have become a cold weather guy and the ideal temp bracket is from +33F up to +55F. Don’t get me wrong and I do love to get my sun exposure in the summer but the humidity here is thick enough to cut.

I use “+” for temps as I lived in the interior of AK where the yearly temp swing is -40F in the winter to +99F in the summer (with no native ac installed!). My ideal temp in AK was -22F to +45F. Everyone was grateful when the temps would hit zero F as we would be out shoveling snow in boots, jackets, and SHORTS!",10,1767269927.0,MultipleSclerosis,0,1.0,False

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.
