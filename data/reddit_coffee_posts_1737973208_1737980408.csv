If any of these reviews pique your interest, give them a try! Truly a wonderful shop, and I only wish the best for  V!

—————————

**Awful Waffle** *(fresh maple syrup over buttery toasted waffles, sweet brown sugar notes with a warm, nutty undertone)*: I mostly get maple syrup out of this, but surprisingly, it’s not painfully sweet! While the syrup dominates, the other notes, such as the butter and the waffle, round it out and gives it a nice, almost creamy-like smoothness. It’s not terribly rich, yet still decadent. If you want a nice pancake n’ syrup scent this is a great choice! Amazing throw, I get lots of compliments. 3.9/5

**Blueberry Tuffin** *(A Blueberry Lemon poppyseed muffin covered in crystallized sugar with a big ol' pat of butter)*: ALRIGHT YALL. This might be the best blueberry muffin scent I’ve tried, and I own two other scents of it (Blueberries Crave Home, Blueberry Tart (HoG)). BCH is very syrupy and thick, while BT is too…sour? But not this one, oh no. It’s sweet, the blueberry muffin is just the right balance of bakery and fruity, while remaining buttery and delicious! I get SO MANY people turning their heads wearing this. Please get this one if you’re a foodie omg, gotta get a backup asap 10/5

**Bubblegunner** *(Classic Bubblegum scent. A tutti frutti blend of artificially fresh fruits on a bed of vanilla sugar)*: yep, that’s bubblegum. All that’s missing is the paper wrapper lol. Not much to say, it’s straightforward and simple. 5/5 for accuracy, but 3/5 for preference.

**Brawlin’ Oats** *(A sweet blend of oats and caramel, with notes of cinnamon and clove dunked into a glass of creamy vanilla almond milk)*: heavily resembles Awful Waffle with spice included. This one is richer, however. I can’t smell the almond milk at all. This scent is STRONG too, so be lighthanded! I don’t really prefer this tbh, maybe if the spice was a bit more subdued? 2.5/5

**Cupajoe** *(Freshly brewed coffee with hints of vanilla and cream)*: Straightforwardly coffee and cream. I gotta say, the coffee note is fantastic. It’s not sour or bitter at all, just a nicely brewed hot cup, lightened ever so slightly with the vanilla and cream. I’m not a big coffee lover but this is just great, one of the best coffee scents out there. 5/5

**Cupanog** *(Strong coffee spiked with creamy eggnog and a touch of winter spices)*: This is just Cupajoe with spices and extra sweetness. It smells fantastic, but I don’t reach for this often because of how “spicy” it is; I prefer OG Cupajoe the best. But if Cupanog sounds right up your alley, highly recommend! 4.5/5

**Divine Mintervention** *(Notes of peppermint and vanilla sugar on a base of buttery dark chocolate)*: Straight up mint chocolate. The mint is sweet and present, and the chocolate is dark, smooth and rich. A very simple scent, but great all the same! 3.9/5

**Gummi Bare Knuckle** *(Scented like a true gummy candy, that chewy saccharine fruity aroma you know and love, fortified with authentic Lemon, Lime, and Blood Orange essential oils):* Points for accuracy! This smells like I dunked my head in a bag of gummy bears. It’s more citrus forward, yet still retains that sweetness you want in a gummy bear. Like Bubblegunner, it’s pretty straightforward. Cute scent! 4/5

**Gimme Chocolate** *(A Hot Fudge with a dollop of Vanilla Sweet Cream):* Ooooh, thick, fudge chocolate brownies. Has a slightly similar opening to Cupajoe. My boyfriend was bouncing between ‘burnt chocolate, chocolate, brownies, cookies,’ a roller coaster of emotions lol. This, to me, reads a dark chocolate brownie. Not bad! 3.5/5

**Moonchild** *(A relaxing blend of Bergamot, Lavender, and Brown sugar. Like a warm cup of sweetened Earl Grey tea):* MOONCHILD MY LOVE. This is the perfect lavender London fog scent for me. Sharp, almost astringent lavender hits immediately, but quickly fades down to reveal smooth, creamy sweetness. It is INTOXICATING. The way the lavender mingles with the sugar…oh my lord!!! If you don’t mind sharp lavender at all, GET THIS ONE, though I’m gonna recommend it anyway to others because of how fast the lavender cools down haha. I have a backup since the store will be closing :( 10/5

**Nutrocker** *(Notes of marzipan, vanilla cream, and amaretto on a bed of warm spiced almonds and roasted chestnuts):* Slightly boozy, chewy nougat with strong almond. STRONG. This is a very sweet scent. I love almond scents but this one was way too over the top for me. If you like almonds tho, give this a try! 3/5

**Orange Sore-Bet** *(The bastard child of a Rainbow Sherbet and a Creamsicle. Notes of Mango, Orange, and Lime with a touch of Raspberry on a bed of cool, creamy vanilla):* Hm, this is mostly a citrus scent imo. The vanilla is there, but slightly? The tang of the citrus isn’t quite tempered enough to let it shine more. I wish I could smell more of the vanilla, but this seems to be the case with almost all the other orange creamsicle scents I’ve had. Oh well. 2.8/5

**Winter Madness** *(Buttery, creamy Eggnog with a kick of Nutmeg, Cinnamon and Clove):* initially it was straight up candle on me, but after letting it rest and testing it out, I can say it’s nice! Spicy, like pumpkin spice, but the creaminess and sweetness comes through. The spice is quite consistent throughout, just like Cupanog. I won’t be FS-ing, but I have like 3 bottles of the samples lol. 3.5/5",1,1737980126.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

A good example is ‘trip’ drinks which plays in the trip of a drug and it is a CBD drink. 

We would prefer one word brand name. Our brand is around going back to the origins or food and beverage, it’s not diet culture or calorie counting, it’s about using clean products that you can easily read on the label, not 100 chemicals in one drink. We want to be clean. We want the brand to hopefully scale into snacks so hence we want a brand name not product.

No, I was supposed to be at a swanky business conference, dazzling a room full of executives with my pitch for a multi-million-dollar deal. That’s the kind of woman I am or was. High heels, power suits, and the kind of confidence that fills boardrooms.

But instead, here I was, stranded in a snowstorm, wearing borrowed flannel pajamas and sipping whiskey by the fire while Ryder, the brooding, broad-shouldered owner of this tiny lodge kept smirking at me like I was some exotic bird he didn’t quite understand.

Let me back up.

It all started when my work trip took me to this remote mountain town. A quick in-and-out, just to assess whether we could incorporate the area into a new regional project. The lodge was supposed to be a pit stop. But then, the storm rolled in. Flights canceled. Roads closed. The entire mountain blanketed in white. And with no Wi-Fi or cell service, I was effectively cut off from my entire world.

That’s when I met Ryder. He was chopping wood when I arrived... Of course he was and he didn’t even look up when I stumbled out of my car, shivering in my designer coat. His beard was flecked with snow, his flannel stretched tight across his chest, and his eyes? Dark, sharp, and annoyingly judgmental.

“City girl,” he said when he finally looked at me. Not a question, just a statement.

“And you’re what, the lumberjack?” I shot back.

That was the tone we started with: antagonistic. He was all about quiet nights, hard work, and zero frills. I was about espresso shots, spreadsheets, and taking over the world. Oil and water, right?

But the storm didn’t care about our differences. It trapped us together.

At first, I tried to keep my distance. I holed up in my room, trying to find a signal on my phone, pacing like a caged animal. But every time I saw Ryder, it felt like he was daring me to loosen up. He had this maddening way of smirking at me, like he could see straight through my polished facade.

And the worst part? He was right.

On the second day, I cracked. When I came downstairs in yoga pants and a sweater having finally accepted my stilettos weren’t making it through the snow, he handed me a cup of coffee and said, “You look better like this.”

I almost spilled the coffee. “Excuse me?”

“I mean without all the… armor.” He gestured vaguely at my face. “You look real.”

I hated how much that stung and how much he turned me on.

The tension between us built like the storm outside. Every time he touched my hand, every time our eyes lingered just a little too long, it felt like the air around us got hotter. And Ryder? He was the kind of man who moved like he owned every room he walked into, even if it was just his own kitchen.

By the third night, the storm had slowed, but the fire between us was raging. After dinner, a homemade stew he insisted on teaching me to cook, we sat by the fire. The whiskey bottle was almost empty, and so were our defenses.

“You’re different than I thought,” he said, leaning back in his chair, his voice low and rough.

“Yeah? What did you think I’d be?” I asked, my pulse quickening.

“Cold. All business. But you’ve got a spark under all that polish.”

I should’ve been offended, but I wasn’t. Instead, I leaned forward, letting the firelight dance across my face. “And you’re not just some grumpy recluse, are you? There’s something you’re running from.”

His jaw tightened, and for a moment, I thought I’d pushed too far. But then he stood, walked over to me, and tilted my chin up so I had to look at him. “You ask too many questions, city girl.”

“Maybe you don’t answer enough,” I shot back, breathless.

And then he kissed me.

It wasn’t gentle. It was raw, hungry, like we’d both been holding back for too long. His hands tangled in my hair, and I clung to him like he was the only solid thing in my world. He tasted like whiskey and danger, and for once, I didn’t care about control or consequences.

The night blurred after that, his hands on my skin, my nails raking down his back, the two of us tangled in a mess of blankets and heat. It was everything I didn’t know I needed.

The next morning, I woke up in his bed, the storm finally clearing outside. But the drama wasn’t over. My assistant had managed to get through on the lodge’s landline, reminding me of the massive presentation I’d missed. And Ryder? He’d overheard.

“So, you’re just going to go back to your perfect city life, huh?” he asked, his voice tight.

“That’s my life,” I said, wrapping my arms around myself. “I don’t belong here.”

“Maybe you don’t belong there, either,” he countered, his eyes burning into mine.

The rest of the day passed in silence as I packed up and waited for the plows. When the time came to leave, Ryder didn’t say goodbye.

Now, I’m back in the city, but everything feels… wrong. The noise, the deadlines, the constant rush, it’s suffocating. And every time I close my eyes, I see Ryder’s face. His smirk. His fire.

I’m thinking of driving back to that lodge this weekend. Because maybe, just maybe, I don’t need to belong anywhere. Maybe I just need him.",1,1737979943.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Yes, another post on this topic, perhaps you are already tired of listening to the same reasoning on the same topic, but in any case, let's discuss this aspect of the ending, but from both sides. If you did not know, Isayama was inspired by many works throughout the writing of the manga, in this post we will touch only on the manga called Himeanole. But unlike similar articles on this topic, for the first time in this topic we touch not only on the manga, but also on the film adaptation of this manga, filmed in 2016, and its features.

**Part 1 What is ""Himeanole""?**

Himeanoles can be divided into two parts, depending on which of the main characters is responsible for the actual plot of the chapter. One of them is an ordinary guy named Okida, he is kind of a shy person, he does not have many friends and does not have a girlfriend. This changes when he goes to a local coffee shop where he meets a woman named Yuki, who later becomes his girlfriend. There are various comedic and awkward moments in this part, most of which will belong to the secondary characters (Ando, ​​Okada's teacher friend), but for us, the important one is the second main character, whose name is **Morita**.

Morita is not normal. He is almost a psychopath. In fact, he has killed in the past and is prone to do so again (he killed a bully who bullied him in collaboration with his classmate). He also asks the classmate **(Wagusi)** with whom he killed the bully to send him money on a regular basis, while not working for 7 years and spending the money on a pachinko machine. But still, his storyline starts, oddly enough, as a minor character whose goal is to help his ""friend"" kill a man for money (an insurance scam), unfortunately, the plan fails and the ""friend"" plans to escape because he is afraid of being arrested, but suddenly something unexpected happens and Morito just kills him.

Later, he calls his ""friend"" Wagusi (a classmate who helped him kill a bully from school) from whom he extorts money and asks him to help him with the body of the murdered man (he doesn't know about the murders), which leads to this dialogue.

**""Chapter 22""** (Warning: possible translation errors)

(Wagusi: Hey, ...don't you fee any guilt?

Wagusi: Haven't you ever imagined the sadness of those who die and the people around them?

**Wagusi: Do you really think it's οκαυ το go that far just for pleasure?**

Wagusi: Even if there's someone similar to **you... that person might be enduring it rationally for their whole life**

Wagusi: You talk about being unlucky\*\*...about feeling sorry for yourself, as if it's all just inevitable.\*\*

Wagusi: But that's the same as saying you're **just like a rapist or an arsonist.**

Morita: Guilt, yes... I never thought about it... But inside me there's always a feeling of striving forward, as if I'm constantly flying towards danger.

Morita: You're only holding on because you can handle it, right? that's why i'm already... done with it.. 

Morita: I remember a moment in middle school when i thought, 'was i just **born to kill people?**' it really gave me chills.

Morita: since that day, something feels like... i'm living half in a dream. i have no sense of reality. every day, what am i doing? it's completely uninteresting...)

[Dialogue](https://preview.redd.it/c4lrgb0v0jfe1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=f504153086e29ddc574987e9343ce04fed71e1ca)

And yes, he doesn't seem to feel any self-loathing or pity for other people, he also directly states his main goal (to kill Yuki and torture her) several times throughout the manga and his number one goal never changes. Later on, the plot switches from killing Yuki to killing Okade when Morito finds out that they are dating and that Okade can become a ""threat"" (my understanding) and tries to get rid of him, he even hires a homeless man who has a driver's license to help him if Wagusi can't (while lying that he wants to teach Okade a lesson as a bad person who insults his ""girlfriend"" Yuki). However, this event becomes the last straw for Wagusi, he plans to turn himself in to the police to stop Morito and his future murders, but his girlfriend suggests to just kill him and he agrees to it, unfortunately, the plan fails and they die at the hands of Morito.

Now Morito uses a homeless man to dispose of the bodies (while threatening him that if he doesn't help, he'll kill him) and burns down his house to delay the police in their investigation of missing people (people die as a result of the arson). After this, several more bad things happen to him (the murder of a woman with cancer who sheltered him, the murder of a policeman after which Morito gets a weapon, the murder of Yuki's neighbor in an attempt to carry out his plan, as well as the man who investigated his case and warned Okada, causing Yuki and Okada to flee the city). In the end, in an attempt to achieve his goals, he killed 7 people and lost everything he had, but never got to Yuki, for the first time he starts thinking about himself and others, and ends up in the hands of the police (knowing that he faces the death penalty).

**Part 2. Those Were Not Human Eyes.**

Honestly, there's a lot to say about the adaptation, but we'll focus on the last 20 minutes of this movie, where things happen that weren't in the manga, and the first thing we'll touch on is the dialogue between Yuki and Okade in the hospital after Ando meets Morita (a completely original scene).

[Dialogue in the hospital](https://preview.redd.it/9gogl2wx0jfe1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6f7b7927da82eb09b05c7e2cce903d7a6ff7a44)

**(01:20:33-01:22:00)**

(Yuki: Mr. Ando will not die.

Okade: It's all because of what I did.

Yuki: What can I do?

Yuki: It is not your fault.

Okade: Of course it is.

Okade: Morita...came for me.

Yuki: It all started when we were dating.

Yuki: It is not your fault.

Okade: Me too...did something.

Yuki: What did you do?

Okade: The truth is...when we got to high school...

Okade: I became friends with Morita.

Okade: We liked the same games.

Okade: But when Morita...

**Okade: Kawashima mocked him...**

**Okade: I started keeping my distance.**

**Okade: Then Morita...stopped coming to school.**

Okade: And Kawashima...there was no one to intimidate and it became boring.

Okade: I forced Morita to go back to school.

Okade: I told him that Kawashima ready to apologize.

Okade: I lied to him.

**Okade: I brought Morita to school. I teamed up with the hooligans.**

**Okade: I looked at him with contempt.**

**Okade: I'll never forget how**

**Okade: He looked at me.**

**Okade: With despair.**

**Okade: He was dying. These were not human eyes.**)

And you got it right, in the 2016 movie we have a different Morito, unlike the original, where it is often said that he was like this from birth, in the movie he is just an ordinary guy who was broken and succumbed to the ""darkness of man"" and started killing. What is even more remarkable is the changed dynamics of the relationship between Okade and Morita, because in the movie they are more like friends than in the manga (**in the original they only had one dialogue at the beginning, and in the movie there are as many as 4**), although you can say that all these dialogues were added only for the sake of the ""final battle"" between school friends.

[Completely original scenes \(rescue Yuki and capture Morito\)](https://preview.redd.it/74mo785b1jfe1.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=4018ad49700be77adfb8aa73ac18ddeb05fd4c5c)

[The ending of the film](https://preview.redd.it/4if8ty5h1jfe1.jpg?width=1544&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=287677dedbd0eb7e410c0b0e8a8cb66fbf33d6a2)

**Part 3 Eren and the Problems of an Idea**

So now we know that Isayama's idea of ​​someone being ""born the way they are"" seems to mostly come from Himeanole, where Morita was never able to become a normal person who could live in society and knew there was always something wrong with him (except for the 2016 movie). Isayama hinted at this idea for Eren at various points in the story, most famously Chapter **121**.

[This implies that there was always something \\""off\\"" about Eren.](https://preview.redd.it/c7o1jbjn1jfe1.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13c0b5a73bdcbdecdd546b8dbfb24af780d02500)

On its own, if you don't take 131 and 139 into account, this is just Eren stating that he would always fight for freedom and that he doesn't hesitate to be violent towards those who tried to rob him of his freedom. Pretty much in line with how most viewed Eren anyway, yes?

A guy who is naturally violent when it comes to his pursuit of freedom but also empathetic enough to care about those around him.

That would be the case, right? Sadly not. And here is where the influence of Himeanole arrives.

In Himeanole, the serial killer was severely bullied as a teenager, but also claims (by himself) that he was born ""different"" (but not in the 2016 film, this plot point is cut).

So what does this have to do with Eren?

He wished for it. He wanted it to happen.

In other words, 131 paints Eren as if he wanted to create the Rumble because he wanted to see the very world that was presented to him in Armina's book: In conclusion: Eren was born with a twisted desire for freedom, that freedom = flat earth (yes, as stupid as that may sound), and because of that, he committed the Rumble. He just wanted a clean surface and wanted to kill humanity because they were in his way.

The Himeanole check here is great. Morita, like Eren, wasn't born ""normal"" and he also had a sick and twisted desire. For his desires, it was to get pleasure by killing people. For Erena, it's a flat world that he wants to have and the only way to achieve that is to kill everyone.

https://preview.redd.it/23gczbqq1jfe1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=015f6a1189f08c431a1603308d066de3f196f298

So why doesn't it just work!!!

The difference between Himeanole and Attack on Titan is that the author of Himeanol portrayed Morita as a villain after his first kill. While you can feel sorry for him, it's hard to ever sympathize with him when you know he's doing it simply because he's an evil pervert who gets pleasure from these people.

Meanwhile, in Attack on Titan, Isayama wrote a ton of reasons why someone should root for Eren. Hell, we see Eren's mother get eaten (reveals he did it, thanks to 139 for that), which would make just about anyone angry. We see him become more calm and rational in Brawl, we see him get genuinely upset at what his father did. We also see Eren even give up his own life to save humanity in the Historia cave.

That doesn't fit a character who apparently just wants to flatten everything because of a random book. Hell, even Eren himself said that he FORGOT the dream he shared with Armin in Chapter 84.

https://preview.redd.it/byadtgvs1jfe1.png?width=979&format=png&auto=webp&s=aebd141707e6d2be0e765920cdc4425a1ffb9f9f

131 wants to tell us that ever since he was a child, Eren has been inclined to see the Earth as flat and devoid of people, and yet in Chapter 84, Eren says that he has long forgotten about that dream and that it has been replaced by a desire for revenge.

He wasn't interested in the sea, he was interested in seeing these things without being bound by any restrictions.

But then the number 131 comes up, implying that ""**seeing this scenery**"" was what Eren had wanted all along, ever since he was a child. There's a reason why these two panels use the image of Eren as a child.

https://preview.redd.it/l7sqlp2v1jfe1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=7648e2618fd237aca36566da1e9586d9759129a8

Suddenly, what he wants to achieve isn't the freedom he would get from killing his enemies, not recognizing the freedom of whatever he wants to think, but the view itself.

The implication is disturbing. In fact, even if the outside world was completely peaceful, Eren would still have caused the Rumble because he was disappointed that humanity even exists outside the walls (**131**).

https://preview.redd.it/b5c1598x1jfe1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=7085cf634b90c05d98a56bd8ca8a3ceb68f63298

So Eren wanted to do the Rumbling because he wanted a flattened world, he states so in 139, he states in 131 that he was disappointed that humanity still existed and that he wanted to wipe it all out. He also states that this is primarily because the world wasn't like the one in Armin's book.

But how does this fit with the same guy who himself previously stated that he forgot about this dream? How could something that Armina's book told him be taken to make him want to destroy the world?

Isayama couldn't answer any of these questions. He took only one part of Morito's character and ignored all the others or replaced them with something that was never part of his character. Morito is honest with himself, he knows what he wants and what he will do (get rid of any threat that could stop him from catching Yuki) for his dream, in the movies he almost achieved this goal, and we see what could have happened to Yuki. Morito deceived and killed people without having to pretend or justify his actions with heroic goals (not much effort in the movie) because most of the time he killed without remorse for his dream, **this is how he was from the beginning to the penultimate chapter**.

And what's funny is that when his conscience woke up and asked about the dead, he again thought only about himself.

So yeah, Eren's character becomes messy because Isayama got too inspired by a work that was created too late and implemented it in a bad and rushed manner, which hardly makes any sense.

**TL;DR**

**The ending was messy and confusing, Isayama shouldn't have tried to force the ""born this way"" theme that he read about in Himeanole and also add new features that were not typical of the original and contradicted.**

**P.S.**

**Although it's also worth noting that the work ""Himeanole"" is surrounded by strange facts and if you know these facts, you can ask very strange questions.**",1,1737979711.0,AttackOnRetards,0,0.99,False

1ib7911,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ib7911/should_i_break_up_with_him_and_call_the/,Should i break up with him and call the engagement off?,"Hi everyone and hello to our potato queen! I love what you're doing and I watched every single video of yours. So I want to say sorry in advance that this might be looong and English is my second language so I'm sorry if I make mistakes. For context Im(26) and I  met my fiancé(28) 7 years ago we been together since , one year and half we've been in a long distance relationship (he was in another country)and then I moved with him. It was hard I was really scared and I suffer from anxiety so for me everything that I had to do it was hard and I was having multiple panick attacks,coming from an abusive family I didn't do therapy so I was a total mess. I'm much better now, I did therapy and I discovered myself more. So over this 7 years I thought I have the perfect boyfriend and the perfect relationship,until I discovered red flags, like him searching through my phone and having all my passwords, I didn't read into it because I didn't have nothing to hide, but if I was taking his phone it was hell on earth, so I discovered he was hiding stuff. Like multiple chats with other women, and the stupid livechat that he is watching all the time,he stays in the bathroom 30-45 min, and he tells me that he has problems with his stomach and that in work(he's working in construction )he doesn't have toilet so he wants to take his time. But this happens when we have chores to do as well,we go shopping this happens really rare because I'm the one who is doing the shopping on a regular basis,and when we get home he runs in the bathroom and I'm left alone with all the groceries. On his phone I find stuff multiple times and I forgive him, and give him another chance..... lots of chances.... even when I found on him Snapchat conversation with another woman and a picture taking by him of her when she was on the street, saying ""nice ass"" and then discussing when to meet, I asking him about it and he said that they meet before accidentally when he was out for a drink and discussing to meet sometimes and that she is a friend of his that he maked when he first came into the country and another 2 women cause I found a video of him when we were apart with another 3 women in a bar smoking and drinking and when I showed him he said that they're just friends and nothing happened,but i never met this ""friends"". When he used to go out he was coming home at 5-6 a m in the morning,he usually goes out when I'm working closing shifts and I finish at 1-2a.m, I told him that this is bothering me and the last straw was when he came home and he was having comdoms in his pockets(we don't use condoms) and we had a fight and i told him that he either is going out only with me, and if he goes alone he should be home by the time i get home from work or we break up,he told me that ""I just what to do stuff that i did years ago,to have fun"" but i told him that if i do the same i will be out on the street and he told me that i can't to that because i have ""responsabilities"" anyway we had a huge argument and i forgive him.  One times he was out and he didn't even told me, and I found out and he started saying that I don't trust him at all and I don't give him freedom. I don't control him, before to find all of this out I was insisting that he should go out and make friends and open our social status,I was trying on my own as well to make friends but I have social anxiety. I tried everything,I tried trusting him and working things our, we bought a small apartment in our coutry 2 years ago and I started to feel like thing go smooth. Now i have a constant feeling that something is not right, another thing that i want to say is we work really hard,he wants to open his own construction company so after work he is doing small jobs and sometimes he comes home at 22:30 or 23:00, and i  have a full time job as well,but I'm left with all the chores in the house, cleaning,shopping cooking i do everything,I'm exhausted all the time and he is making remarks that we weren't intimate in 2 weeks, we barelly see each other and when we are together we're both exhausted. So yesterday i was having a bad feeling cause last week he came home later than usual and I went through his phone again,and i found that he search for car met up (you know what i mean) and olamet a dating app, and on our aniversary day he ask a girl out for a coffee, my heart is in pieces. On the 10th of this month i was working night shift and he send a d\*ck pic to somebody,i found it in the deleted photos and on one of the picture it was a message ""out for a drink?"" send to him,but i couldn't see the name or find the conversasion because he deletes everything, i install snapchat back in his phone cause since the last time when i found staff on the app he deletes the app and i found only girls,no conversation,but full of girls and on telegram he has girls as well and on top of that livechat every sinlge day. i don't know what to do , the house is on my name and my MIL, he had some problem with a loan taken years back in the homecountry so he didn't put the name, i'm all alone in here, i don't have friends or family with me, i can afford to live alone cause i'm payed good, but im just thinking that maybe we can work things out, but is to much . i think i deserve better, i feel like this is not a future for me but then i remember that he is my family and i don't know what to do. Please help me. Thank you and i wish you all to have all the best in the world. ",3,1737979624.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

This is my first time traveling to Thailand.

The plan, 2 weeks of playing tourist and exploring. 1 week of work (in between).

* I'm not a big party type. So no crazy hedonism for me.
* I'm a part-time chef, so I'd like to explore the markets, explore the food (street food, homestyle, fine dining), everything appeals to me.
* I train muay thai at home, and want to find coaching for private sessions. I've been casually training for 7+ years. I'm far from being good. I just want to avoid places that are too touristy and actually want to learn to improve my technique.



Also, this is also my first work-abroad trip. It's pretty much a miracle I was able to convince my boss allow me a ""trial run"".

***I really need work to go flawlessly.***

I don't think I'm too fussy with what I need. A moderately fast, stable internet connection (landline?), maybe aircon?

Probably what I'm most concerned about is where I can safely leave my laptop while I grab a coffee or use the facilities. I don't want to have to keep packing up my gear, and setting it all up again during a work day. So I suspect a cafe is probably out of the question. But maybe a coworking space is overkill in cost? Is there something in-between? and I should just factor that into an airbnb?  I know I'm probably overthinking this a bit, but I've never done the ""work on a laptop"" thing before and keeping it safe and secure.

  
I'm hoping you might have some thoughts and recommendations.

  
How to split my time up?  Initially I was thinking Bangkok and Changmai? But I heard burning season and air pollution is pretty rough right now.

Also, I think the work part of this trip worries me the most.  Any advice there would be most appreciated.

I am 20 and I am in college. I had been diagnosed since pre-teen but my parents refused medication so I waited until I am on school insurance (and not parent insurance) to see a psychiatrist for medication. 

Anyways, I was told to take my daily pill with / after breakfast. The thing is, I dont wake up early enough before classes to have proper breakfasts. I have a 1-hour lunch break after my first lecture and that’s when I eat brunch/take my meds. Which worked out ok. I drink a cup coffee around 4/5 pm and goes to bed around 1/2am and sleep normally (I have chronic back pain and teeth-grinding do my sleep quality can only be so good) 

But during the weekend I wake up around 2pm and have my first meal around 3pm (with coffee) then took my meds. I had a completely sleepless night (it is currently 7am and I had been tossing on my bed for the last 5 hours which is my usual bed time so I think we can call it a sleepless night). I also didn’t sleep well last night (I had three consecutive nightmares and they all had me waking up sweating when our room is aroun 20 degree Celsius). 

I was wondering, is this because of my time of taking my meds or is this like an actual side affect I should be worry about.

1ib72im,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Brave-Reporter-3754/comments/1ib72im/my_boyfriend_jerked_off_one_night_on_bumble/,My boyfriend jerked off one night on bumble.,"My boyfriend and i have been together for 1 year and 3 months now. Everything was great, I had a good feeling about everything, he was so attentive, always wanted to talk about everything, constantly showed how much he loved me. He didn't go out anywhere that much, if he does, it's sometimes for coffee for an hour and then home. I never had a bad feeling that he would ever cheat on me. Already at the beginning of the relationship, he put my Face ID on his cell phone and said I have nothing to hide from you. One day I took his  phone and unlocked it, and before that he was in the gallery looking for something, as soon as I unlocked the phone and it was in the gallery where he stopped. I was shocked because I saw 2 photos of a woman in sexy clothes. I'm a panicker by the way and I immediately asked what this was. He said that he took it off so he could jerk off and that he liked the outfit and would like me to wear something like that someday. Then he said from which site he downloaded those photos, for free. He used to have profiles on everything where he could jerk off, since he was free. He immediately went to the site and gave me the phone to review. I investigated in detail, he never paid anything, I reviewed the transactions. He told me many times that he would like to have my sexy photos so that he can jerk off sometime or we can make a video together. Or like when we were talking on the phone once and he jerked off like that. I didn't take anything seriously. I avoided doing it. I don't know why. He was in a long relationship then broke up because she cheated on him. His mom told me that he came crying and saying ""How many of them was she with"" and went to get tested. After her, he went out with a girl once more and he didn't like it and didn't want to continue. He decided to be alone and jerk off. 

At the beginning of our relationship, he deleted all the girls from Instagram and said I don't need it. Later, he also deleted everyone from Facebook. He never followed a girl, added, liked that I saw. Then he deleted Instagram and Facebook. Deleted tiktok and everything. The following situation is happening recently. On the banking application (I have access to his account), I saw 14.99e that he paid for something from the Apple store. I asked him what it was. He said bumble premium. I was shocked and asked why you entered that and took the premium. He said because he was jerking off. He got an ad on the game and he clicked to see if his profile was still there. He entered inside took premium so he could browse, see who liked him (because he needed that to boost his confidence) and after jerking off he was investigating if I was using bumble. He says he immediately deleted the app after that because he immediately realized he shouldn't have done that. And when he admitted it to me, he immediately downloaded the application and let me take a look. There were his old pictures, old chats before our relationship, and in the section where it says what he is looking for, it said: one committed relationship. He took that premium only in 7 days, the shortest possible time. He says that he is used to scrolling like that before, and when he comes across someone in a bikini or dressed in sexy clothes, he stops and jerks off and then continues scrolling. My world collapsed because I trusted him so much and I never thought it would come to this. He said it was sick how addicted he was to jerking off. And that he was looking for different ways to do it. He says that he got tired of jerking off in the same way, so he jerked off that way. He says he used to do that on Instagram and Facebook, but he doesn't have that apps anymore. I didn't find anything on that bumble profile, no sign of anything. But he came to me himself and admitted that he liked all the women because they swiped to the right because it was easier for him and because he had done it that way before. He swears by everything that he never thought that he wanted something with someone, that he never had contact or anything more than that. He wants to take a polygraph because he doesn't want to lose me. He realizes that he hurt me, made a mistake and is working on it because he is aware of his problem. In every possible way, he proves that he never did anything. He changed iCloud, created a new one, deleted all profiles, gave access to everything I want. He says that he wants a new start in everything and that he doesn't want to lose me. He's asking me to help him with jerking off. He is otherwise a shy person and the chats that were on bumble before were maybe 12 in total and they were all short like ""Hello"" ""Hello"" ""What's up"" and nothing more than that. He never wrote ""you're hot"" or that he wanted something with someone. He's not that kind of person. There were only 2-3 messages each and that's it. And he always had the opportunity to have sex when he was single, he didn't want to because he wasn't interested in it. But he jerked her off in every possible way.

before i moved in with him and our other roommate (M-24), I lived with two boys who were a bit messy, but always helped with the sunday reset and always asked if there was anything else that they could help with the clean.

i knew my bf was messy, when i first went to his place when we first started dating, it was a bit messy but he would always clean up before i got there, so i thought it wasn’t as bad. i also knew he was a gamer and was addicted to it, as we spent many hang outs just playing games together, which was fine i like gaming too.

now to now, we’ve been living together for over six months now and it has been the worst. i am also untidy, but always clean up after myself. him however, it’s like a trail of him and constantly just cleaning up after him and the other roommate. i ask for him to do one thing and it will be delayed and he will say “in a moment” but will take so long that I just end up doing it and then will ask why I didn’t wait. mind you, i once waited three hours for him to do something and reminded him multiple times to see if he would do it and then he didn’t.

i also tried to not touch or clean anything for a whole week and just cleaned up after myself, and the mess that happened at the end of week was so bad, it took me three hours to clean the place.


it’s also the fact he cannot do anything himself, i ask him to go grocery shopping and he cannot do it without my input, he never follows the list or if im with him he expects me to do it, and follow the list.  he never cooks or if he does, it’s him taking over and commenting on everything that i get so annoyed and leave.

he only just recently got a job again after being employed for months so i thought it was him in the unemployment head that he isn’t good enough, but he tells me at work he hustles but cannot do it at home when i ask.

i will constantly drive even though i don’t want too, i offer to pick him up when he’s out partying but he will never for me. 


like today I wanted to get a drawers because he has a ute, and after we put it in the tray and drove away we noticed the drawers were opening as it was upright, so i went to move it but it was too heavy and he never came out to help and it resulted in the drawer falling out and breaking on the ground. 💔

i was upset the whole day as he just laughed at how the drawer broke but i was so upset that he never helps me.

also i just didn’t want to talk to him today, so he went to a dam swimming with his friends and i cleaned the apartment and he got home I was still too upset to speak and he never offered me food or dinner or anything.

but when he’s upset or gaming, and when he just wakes up im always offering to cook or make him coffee.

i know this is random and very unorganised post but I physically and mentally am drained, and it hurts my heart he will never help me or anything. 

all of my friends say i need to leave, but i love him and i don’t know what to do. 

tldr- basically i’m my partners parent/maid and he doesn’t even realise because he’s too lazy to care about me. 💔",1,1737978833.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I wait until my brain feels sharp again often a few hours later hit go fix if need and it's done. I somehow well my brain won't compute my brain kinda freezes. I like coding for work and hobby my mind drifts away to a land of logic. But I refuse coding without the sharp feeling.

I don't want to endup stressed either this brake kinda protects me as well but sometimes it's not handy to have. My productivity isn't at risk I'm a solo dev working on my own. I just wonder do others recognise this?

A freeze, a worry, afraid to execute, taking a few hours not wanting to think... awaiting the sharp inspiration the flow of thoughts.
I wish to handle this better, tried coffee coding music fresh walks etc but all are not a quick relief.
As if I'm not feeling sharp my code sucks.

1ib6yxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/75edrecovery/comments/1ib6yxz/75_hard_ed_recovery_edition_join_me/,75 Hard - ED Recovery Edition - Join Me???,"To preface, I am absolutly aware that the 75 hard challenge is about getting fit and usually loosing weight, which I am definatley not looking to do and none of my rules are that of the actual 75 hard - its just a fun title.

I have just got myself in such a rut and if I can hold myself accountable for 75 days to properly try and get better I can see where I am. For context, I was diagnosed with anorexia last July after an awful year and since then have not got any worse but not any better either. I'm just stuck at home - working the odd jobs, rarely seeing friends or getting any enjoyment out of life. In October, I chose to take a year out of Uni to 'get better'. My mental health has improved being away from Uni but I have not made any real progress and now feel completly usless as I'm just sat at home. Somehow, I'm comfortable because (I realise I'm very lucky to say this) my life doesn't have a lot of challenges right now, but I'm also miserable. I properly realised yesterday that recovery is not going to be comfortable becuase I've really got to push myself to get out of really bad habits. Its going to be hard - hense the name - but better now than in 5 years, right?!

So this blog is about holding myself accountable. I try properly for 75 days and see where I am. And I don't just mean in eating more, though that definatley needs to be a part of it, but just try harder at life: see friends, work, engage with therepy, all of it. And if my life is worse in 75 days because of this, well, I know its not healthy to say, but I can always go back. I dont think thats likely though... if I do this properly.

So, my aims

* Weight gain. I don't want to go into it too much and make it a focus but I can't deny it needs to happen. I want to be well on my way or at a healthy weight. Not sure it will happen in 75 days but I want to eventually be fully weight restored. I'm not going to write down my rules here for how this is going to happen becuase most of them involve eliminating a lot of restrictive habits that I don't want to trigger people with/give people ideas. But I've written them down for myself and need to stick to them
* Visit my friends at Univeristy and join them on a night out. Got 3 uni's I would like to visit in the next 75 days. Have really neglected friendships over the last year. I have great friends that are supportive but I want to show them that I am getting better
* Get a job, but don't let it become a way of restricting. Got 2 interviews this week so well on the way to making this happen. I have been working since I got back from uni but it was making me miserable as it was very isolated and it was very active which isn't great for me right now. My ideal job is in a coffee shop and after months of applying I have 2 interviews for them this week so feeling pretty happy about that!
* Restore family relationships
* Daily self-care
* Reduce screen time
* Read more and work on hobbies

I'm going to use this list of aims to come up with a list of rules for each day, but this post is gettibg quite long now so might do it seperatley.

I have no idea if anyone will every read this but if you are and you are in a similar situation to me, please join along! Comment your own targets/rules or any questions you have and we can hold each other accountable a bit. I abolutley realise my aims dont apply to everyone with an ed (specifically the weight gain one) but we can all have our own.

Remember, 75 days - thats finishing 12th of April (just in time for Easter). If we do this properly , our lives may be complelty different my summer.

I will try and post each day with updates/motivations and reminders (mainly for myself) of why I'm doing this.

Please comment if you are joining along!

I've always been a night owl, but in the most extreme sense of the term. Even insomniac felt inaccurate. I would like to blame it on the graveyard shift at the bar. The neon sign outside flickers in a way that's oddly comforting, casting an eerie glow into the booths and bartop that's as consistent as my “insomnia”. The smell of grease, cheap vodka, and a hint of vomit fills the air, a constant reminder that it's 3 AM but this city never sleeps. Just like me. 

Being removed but still adjacent to the Vegas strip, we get a lot of interesting characters wandering in outside of our loyal regulars. Granted, our regulars were quite the cast themselves-- we had one guy who somehow always shit on the bathroom floor, Alice who was seventy but flirted like a teenager, someone I called Pirate Dan because he always wore a pirate hat and ordered rum
My personal favorite was an old fuck named Desi who had nicknamed me Piss because of the apparent smell of my bar. She's here every night, always tips well, and is always mean as hell to me. I've learned to love it. 

A new regular started coming in a few weeks ago. A girl who was always dressed in dirty clothes. She'd sit at the counter, nibble on an order of fries, sip a drink, and stare at me with eyes that held…something? It was a deeply intense gaze. At first, I thought she was just another Vegas night crawler, lost and seeking refuge from the night's shadows in the sanctum of an almost 24-hour bar. But her visits grew more frequent, and she began leaving notes scribbled on napkins with cryptic messages about meeting God and chosen peoples and obscure Bible verses and always, somewhere in the middle, the number 23. I threw them out at first, figuring her for a harmless nutter, but recently, the behavior was getting much more intense. 

One night, she didn't bother with the usual song and dance. She slid onto the barstool across from me, her eyes gleaming with a mix of excitement and drug use. ""You're one of us,"" she said, her voice a low, urgent whisper. ""You don't know it yet, but you're special."" My first thought was to laugh in her face, but there was something in her gaze that stopped me. She was so sincere about it. It was creepy but intriguing. I set down the glass I was polishing and decided to humor her.

“That so? Because Desi thinks I smell like piss.” The old woman at the end of the bar cackled.

This girl ignored my joke. ""Your parents,"" she continued, leaning closer, ""they knew things. They were part of something that could change everything."" I felt a chill run down my spine, not from the cold, but from a memory I couldn't quite grasp. Parents? The word was as alien to me as the concept of needing sleep. I hadn't seen my parents since they lost custody of me when I was very young. I couldn't remember a thing about them, though, outside of them being arrested and me being shipped off to live with an uncle I hadn't even known existed. But she talked of them with such fervor and familiarity, her eyes shining with a fanatical light that was both mesmerizing and terrifying. ""They understood the 23s of the world,"" she murmured, her voice barely audible over the hum of the fridge. ""It's your age, you know. The age you stopped aging.""

I wasn't sure if I should laugh or not. 

""They were the most devout of followers,"" she said, her voice gaining strength. ""They sought the secret to the problem of age, so we could all meet God in the end. And they found it."" 

Now, I had to laugh. “You're fucking nuts,” I said, taking her half drank whiskey. “And you're cut off.”

“You don't believe me.”

I repeated myself. “You're fucking nuts.”

“You haven't aged since 23. Don't you wanna know why?” 

“Lady, I'm 28. And based on my daily aches and pains, I've been aging just fine.” Sure, I looked young for my age, I always had, but that could so easily be genetics or my lack of sunshine.

“They found it,” she said again. “They were the most devout amongst us and they succeeded.”

“Lady, you're in a cult. Get out while you can.”

“It's not a cult, it's a group of people who know the truth, and you're the proof!”

I had to roll my eyes at this point. “Every cult says they're not a cult. But sure, humor me, what did they find?”

“They found it,” she repeated once more with conviction. “The solution. But it came at a price.” Her eyes never left mine. ""They had to give something up."" My heart skipped a beat, only because she was practically staring into my inner being at this point. She looked like she was gonna cannibalize me. “A soul. Yours. For the gift!”

I studied her face, looking for any sign of a joke, but she was dead serious. She said her name was Lila at first, and she claimed to be part of the same cult that my parents had been in. The same cult that had sold my soul to find the secret to living forever, so they could “meet God”. ""They wanted to be the chosen ones,"" she said, her eyes wide with a mix of awe and horror. ""To live as long as the earth itself, to meet God at the end of the world."" The absurdity of it all was laughable, but the way she talked about it, with such confidence, almost made me feel like I was missing something crucial.

""Look,"" I sighed, “I don't know what game you're playing, but I've got to get back to work."" She reached out and placed her hand on mine, her grip surprisingly firm, and yanked me nearly over the bartop with shocking force. ""They want you to join us,"" she whispered, her breath hot against my skin. ""You're the proof that it worked. You're their legacy."" I pulled my hand away, wiping it on my apron. Legacy? All I felt was a cold emptiness where my soul would be. Should be. Is, no fucking shot was she telling the truth.

Lila didn't take the hint. She started showing up at my apartment after work, her dark eyes boring into me like she could see through to the void inside. I'd find her sitting on the stoop, her back against the peeling paint, her hands wrapped around a cup of coffee that flies floated in. She talked of rituals and prophecies, of how I could help the group grow, how we could all be chosen if we did it right. But I wasn't buying it, it was the ramblings of a freak. 

And yet, it was kind of getting to me. It was easily the lack of sleep-- all I wanted was to fucking sleep-- and it was making me question a lot about myself. Like, why couldn't I sleep? Anyone who slept as little as I did should be dead. The only times I slept were those once a month episodes where it was like my physical form got sick of my shit and just collapsed. I'd pass out, be out for a solid day or so, and then start the cycle all over again. I was also surprisingly hardy for someone who took so little care of himself. I ate like shit, when I did eat, and drank like a sailor. I never drank water because water is gross. I'd got hit by a car walking home from work once and spent only two hours in the ER, despite doctors telling me I should have died. I could not remember the last time I'd gotten even a head cold. I guess, if I was some immortal being, it would explain a lot. And yet, my life was so fucking lame.

No, no, she was just some nutter at the bar who'd grown obsessed with me. When I told my uncle about her, keeping some details vague, his only advice was to tell her to fuck off and that I swung for the other team. 

“Oh please,” I scoffed. “I don't think she wants to bang me.”

“Aw come on, emo pretty boys like you are all the rage again. Better get a boyfriend fast or break her heart, kid.”

“Rudie, you're not fucking listening. She's batshit, she's pretending like she knows who mom and dad are and is obsessed with the number 23-- she even has a fucking tattoo with it-- and telling me about all this cult shit. She’s shown up everywhere. For what reason? Like, what if she's right? What if she did know mom? And da--”

Uncle Rudie snapped at me. “Go. To. Bed. You're fucking delusional.”

“Go to bed? And what, sleep?” I laughed. “I'd fucking love to. But here I am coming to you with a real problem and you're dismissing me, you always fucking do this.” We had a lot of nights like this, and admittedly, my lack of sleep probably contributed to a lot of it. I could act like a shitty teenager sometimes. But Uncle Rudie was always more like a roommate than a father figure. Sure, he had my best interest at heart, but he knew shit about parenting and never knew how to help me with anything. 

“And what makes you think I know what to do!? Call the cops if you're that fucking worried, I don't know what you want from me. You work at a 24 hour bar in Las Vegas, what are you expecting? Normal fucking people? If you're scared of her, call the cops. But don't buy into her bullshit, have some sense.”

Maybe he was right, but… “Actually, we're a 23 hour bar, we close for an hour at lunch-- 23! That number keeps popping up, you don't think that's weird? Like, at all?”

“Shut up and go to bed, don't let this dumb broad convert you into some weird sex cult because you have mommy and daddy issues.” He dismissed me with a wave, taking a big swig of his Scotch as he did so. 

I held my tongue. He was right, I should sleep, but damn did I get sick of his dismissive attitude. Still, I reminded myself to be grateful to the fact he took me in again after an abusive relationship left me homeless. Funny, that happened and landed me back here when I was 23…

No, I wasn't ready to let it go yet. I bolted out of my room with vigor.

“Tell me about dad. You never say shit about him!” I shut the TV to force him to listen.

“I don't know shit! He left home to go live on some hippie commune when I was still a brat, shit, you know I was only fifteen fucking years old when you were born, right? And I didn't even know who the fuck you were till those social workers dropped your scrawny ass on my doorstep.”

“Hippie commune?” He'd never mentioned that before. “You never told me that! Why don't you ever tell me shit?” 

“Because my brother was an ass and ditched all of us. Didn't say shit to me, or mom or dad, we never knew he met a woman or had a kid. Just acted all high and mighty one day, said he had all the answers and told us all to fuck off. I'm glad you don't remember that prick, why should you?”

I had to concede defeat. I had really thought he was keeping secrets. That stalker girl with her weird words was getting to me. But it seemed he didn't really know anything. 

“I just… I don't know man. It's hard not knowing anything about myself. I'm not normal, I know I'm not, and it'd be nice to know why, yanno? Even if it's, I don't know, weird ass cult shit.”

“Trust me,” Rudie sighed. “The last time I saw your dad, he was not well. Got super righteous and churchy and just disappeared. And if this weird chick does know your folks, you don't want any of that. Yeah, you're a weird fucking kid, but there ain't no shame in that. You live in Las Vegas, weird fucking kids are a dime a dozen. Get over it.”

I sighed. “She's just…got me all on edge. I guess if I do see her again, I'll, I don't know, call the police or whatever.”

Well, I did see her again. But the police didn't do shit. They laughed me off, really. So I was stuck with my weird culty stalker. The more she came around, the less she freaked me out, though. She went from a genuine creep to just a nuisance. 

One night, Lila caught me at my most vulnerable—exhausted and fresh out of a fight with a patron I had to throw out. I'm genuinely a huge pussy, so when he swung, I froze and got myself a nice shiner.

Lila told me she knew how to give me back what I'd “lost"". I just sighed and thought to myself here we go again, I'm not in the mood tonight. I was rattled, but not from her, not anymore. I began to just get used to her popping up and starting with “Remember me? I'm--” followed by some name akin to Lila or Lena or Leelu or whatever. 

“That fight?,” I said with a snarky sigh, earning a slight snicker from Desi at the end of the bar. “Is that what I've lost?”

“Your soul,” she said feverishly. “But what if you could get back what you've lost with your condition?”

I just raised a brow and poured Desi another drink. 

""You don't want to live like this,"" she said, her voice soothing. ""Alone, forever. It's a prison, not a prison, not a gift.”

“What's a prison?,” I asked, confused at what she meant. 

“You're able to live forever,” she hummed. “You get to meet God! But at what price? You don't sleep, do you? That's a side effect I bet. And you'll have to watch everyone you love die. Come with me and we can fix it?”

“No fucking shot,” I said, trying not to fall in.

“Hey, Piss, make the next one a double!” Desi was great at killing the tension and keeping me grounded here, to this bar, not to some weird immortality cult shit.

I took Lila Luna Leela’s glass away from her. “You're cut off. Actually, you're banned. I'm sick of seeing you.”

“But you don't want answers? A hundred years from now, you'll be all alone as you wait to meet God. Do you want that, Nero?”

“You don't even know my name, and you want me to believe you knew my parents? Get lost.”

“Names are irrelevant in the grand scheme of time, which you have all of in the world. But I do know! I know you're a Capricorn, you were born on New Years, in a California desert town called--”

This time I took her fries away and loudly threw them in the waste bin. “Get out, you freak.” 

That kept her away for maybe three weeks. I thought maybe I was rid of her. But in truth, she was laying low, watching out of sight, and waiting for me to be just vulnerable enough. 

I was trying to find someone, anyone to cover the rest of my shift. I could feel it coming, the collapse. I had passed out in the cooler at work once and that was not a day I wanted to repeat. Thank God for Dahlia. She assured me she'd be there in five. 

I must have looked worse for wear, because even Desi was showing me pity. “Son, why not sit down after you pour that?” Of course, she wanted her drink first. I nearly dropped it as I gave it to her, I was starting to feel so dazed. 

Dragging my feet, I slumped into an empty booth seat and tried to wait for Dahlia to show up. But I didn't make it, within minutes I was out cold. Ordinarily, any one of my coworkers would call Rudie, but apparently, someone said they knew me and I ended up in the back of some strangers' car.

Well, she wasn't a stranger. I'd gotten to know her uncomfortably well at this point. By the time I came to, it had to have been close to four hours. I was still terribly groggy, not having slept nearly enough, but something within me told me shit wasn't right, and I jolted awake. The scenery outside was both familiar and not. It was the desert, but not the desert I was used to. A sign reading “Zzyxx” gave me an idea of where we were. 

“You're fucking kidnapping me!?” Lula had me in her backseat. I wondered how she even managed that when I'd told everyone at the bar what a weirdo she was. She tossed a wig in the back. 

“Said I was your sis and they bought it! I'm very sorry, this isn't how I wanted to show you, but you have to! You have to see it!” 

I genuinely did not want to see shit. I tried to open the door, ready to throw myself onto the asphalt to avoid her and wherever she was taking me, but she had child locked the doors. “You're. Insane.”

“You're the one! The Child of the Void, you need to see it!”

I kicked the back of her seat as hard as I could. Somehow, she was unphased. I tried the windows, but again, child lock. 

I wasn't ready to give in though. I calmly crawled into the front seat, slumping down like I was giving up. As soon as she opened her mouth to spew nonsensical babble once more, I lunged over and fought her for the wheel. We veered about the road, skidding on and off it. Lucky for us, these desert side roads were pretty barren. 

“You just don't get it yet!,” she cried out. 

“I don't wanna get it!”

“But you're proof, proof of the new religion--”

“Eat shit and die,” I spat.

The car spiraled a minute, unceremoniously tipping side to side before stopping in the sand. Lana and I were both dizzied, but I had adrenaline on my side. I kicked the driver side door open and stepped on her as I barrelled out. I hoped it hurt. 

My face met sand and dazed me a moment before I scrambled back to my feet and took off running. Where? Anywhere at this point.

“You won't make it far!” I heard Liza shout. “You need me!” Strange, she wasn't following me, as if she knew something I didn't. 

“YOU need help!,” I shouted, flipping her off as I did so.

The sun scorched the land, making the horizon warbled and the air stale. Every breath I sucked in felt like I was giving head to a blow dryer. It had to have been over 100°, easily. But hey, if I was this so called immortal being like this nutjob claimed, I guess this was a good way to test it. 

I had no way of knowing where I was or where the nearest highway was. She'd either taken my phone or I left it in the car; either way, I was completely stranded on all fronts. No wallet either. Being alone with my thoughts, they naturally bounced back to my past. Memories I was sure I had forgotten were starting to bubble through, as if the grueling climate was forcing me into a vision quest. 

In Joshua trees, I saw my parents, in the distant windmills, I saw crosses. That's right, our house was full of crosses, adorned with the number 23. I remembered, for the first time in my life, my parents' faces. They were so cold looking. They were gaunt and placid, as if they'd been malnourished. Only my mother smiled, but never at me. She was always pulling me away from the windows and doors, telling me I wasn't needed out there. I remember only being allowed to eat soup…

The only one who left the little shack we lived in was my father. When he did, he always had a backpack full of books and papers and what not. He only left like, once a month, and would be gone for days. 

At this point, the sun was high in the sky, frying me like an egg. This was the most sunshine I had gotten probably ever, and I felt like it was affecting my psyche. Who said sunshine was good for you? This sucked. I was sweaty and sticky and I wanted to vomit. I did vomit. I couldn't see a road, couldn't see a car, and I wondered if I had really fucked up with my escape plan. 

Lack thereof.

“I'm gonna fucking die,” I laughed. I should have made a plan. But I didn't. So I sat down and gave up, ready for the desert sands, or a snake, or a gila monster to take me. 

But none did. I watched the sun climb up, and down, until the cooler night air began to settle in. This time, I was fighting sleep, still on edge. Sure, I'd said I was ready to die, but I wasn't quite ready to confront that. I found myself mindlessly drawing 23s in the sand, still thinking about my youth and probably losing brain cells. 

Between the blips of memory, something stuck out. It was the one time we'd had guests over. If they were part of this cult, I suppose these were the other cultists. They ooo'd and aww'd over me for awhile, congratulating my parents for bearing the “first child”. Did none of the other cultists have kids? I remembered the mood shifting sharply all at once, and pain. Such pain. And then, business as usual for at least a year or so, before police came and arrested my parents (and possibly everyone else). I remember the social worker's face better than my parents. She was a nice lady, but she always looked confused. I probably said weird shit to her. 

It came and went, until I tasted sand as I collapsed once more.

So she did know something I didn't, because when I woke up again some time later, I was on a bed in some dingy windowless room. 

“I watched you sleep.” It was Linda, smiling frantically.

“You knew I was gonna…” My voice trailed off.

“I assured you you would not go far. But that is ok. I'll forgive all the resistance because we made it. Now I can show you, and you'll finally get it.”

“No.”

“No?”

“No,” I repeated. 

“We’ll help you understand. Sorry for this.” 

She promptly got up and exited, locking the door behind her. I was sure she'd come back with some bodyguards or something to beat me into submission, but it was kind of worse than that. She left me alone for God knows how long. Hours and hours and hours and hours with me and all of my thoughts, a buzzing light that wouldn't turn off, and no windows to even guess how long I'd been alone. It was maddening. No new memories resurfaced, just those same glimpses over and over, like a horribly edited movie. None of it made sense. The first couple of hours were annoying, but the longer it dragged on, the more dreadful it became. I ripped up the paint on the door I clawed at it so desperately. I banged myself up trying to tackle it. I just wanted to break out. When I was sure it wasn't happening, though, I laid down and gave up. I tried to smother myself with the pillow, but nothing happened. Maybe it really was all true.

1ib6x71,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1ib6x71/lonely_depressed/,Lonely Depressed,"Hi,

I 26 M have been struggling with connection through out my life and would go years in between some relationships that never last more than 6 months.

My confidence has never been “healthy” and recently has been the lowest that it’s ever been.

I’ve had hinge for a few weeks and have gotten 2 matches. 1 of which messaged me first last week. We hit it off on the app and set a date 2 days later to get a drink after her short work shift. She mostly inniated idea of coffee & card/board game for a first date.  We ended up changing this to a drink cus her shift was in the Am.

I recommended a spot and she did not respond for 24 hours which concerned me considering she was triple texting me and i thought we liked each other. She texted me morning of date and said she had to bail but implied we could reschedule. 

So far, she hasn’t responded but even if she did i don’t think that I should entertain her behavior to me taking day(s) to get back to me. 

This sparked my anxiety and on Sunday i spent day watching football game and My friend (who is crazy popular) introduced me to his friend that’s a girl. 

She was nice to me and we had things to talk about. She came alone only knowing my friend who introduced us in a group of maybe 11-13 people. She was the only single girl but not only girl. So when he was talking to other friends me and her would talk. 

End of night a different guy in the group walked her home. I was very upset/ jealous and already upset from Hinge date ghosting me yesterday.

I long for connection and have resorted to making a wall of pillows in my bed to feel like i am next to someone.",1,1737978648.0,loneliness,0,1.0,False

For an espresso, I currently have to set my grind size to 40 to achieve a consistent shot of 30–35 seconds. However, because I have to grind more coarsely, I’ve noticed that the automatic tamping doesn’t work as well compared to finer settings, likely due to the coarser grind. Lower grind settings are not an option, as they sometimes result in extraction times of up to a minute.  
  
I’ve already adjusted my tamping fan to a lower setting and can now fit around 19 grams of coffee in my double filter basket. Unfortunately, I can’t lower the tamper further (about 4–5 threads are visible). How can I resolve this? Is my water flow not optimal, or could there be another issue?  
  
PS: This is the third time I’ve purchased this machine because the tamping on the previous two didn’t work properly. I’m thrilled that it’s working much better now, but with my previous machines, I could get a good espresso at grind settings of 6–7.",1,1737978622.0,BrevilleCoffee,2,1.0,False

I will try to make it's as short as possible but still have enough detail to understand my point of view. I am sorry if this is kind of scattered as I put all my thoughts to words.

I thought I had a really good relationship with my husband (over 5 years married). About a year ago I found out that's not the case. 

To kind of get to the point,
After feeling my husband was distracted and more distant than normal (ADHD) I caved into my stupidity and looked through his phone. We have always had an open phone policy as both our last relationships were cheaters. Well I found he was talking sexual to other people, and sadly it has been a majority of our relationship. 

For some context when we first started dating I told him that I was attracted to females as well as men but wasn't looking or interested in a female to be in a relationship with. I know I want a relationship with a man. 

About 4 years into our marriage he brings up an open marriage. I thought I was clear in stating i didn't want one and we had moved on but this conversation was in the back of my head when I went looking through his phone. I found them, an app where he hid these conversation. 

Sadly this hit me harder as it's what happened in my last relationship but this time I had 2 kids already. What also hurt was him doing it during both pregnancies, talking sexual to other people. 

Now here is where we fight alot he thinks talking to others isn't cheating you have to have sex to cheat apparently. I don't see it that way. He doesn't believe emotional cheating is a thing and I do. I feel it is super disrespectful how he talks to people like this but I would never. I also feel if I was do this and he found out he'd be pissed. (More on this later)

I am a stay at home mom right now. I used to work while his mom watched our kids until I started college then we moved further away from her to be closer to his work. We agreed I'd stay home with kids (still under school age) as we didn't and couldn't afford to have childcare and I was going to school anyways. 

So I found these messages about a year ago. We get into a huge fight. I wanted a divorce over it. We argue for days and things are said to me that in hindsight feel manipulative. Either way I made a stupid choice but thought it'd save my marriage and the people pleaser in me would be happy. I was wrong.

I was so worn down at this point I tell him if he is going to talk to her anyways than I better be included too. He is happy he gets what he wants. I try to make it work inviting her over trying to get to know her interests and get close as she is with my husband but I get the feeling she also didn't want to be in an open relationship she wanted my husband to herself. During this time, we were physical with her, but all interactions were promised to be threesomes. I bring up a few times to my husband I feel she wants more with him and I kept getting brushed aside. Finally she comes out and says she wants alone time with my husband both sexual and nonsexual. I say absolutely not. At this point we're trying to make anything work so he says I can start talking to other people like he's been doing.

I met a two people during this time. One I stopped talking to as he was also cheating on his partner and that's a no for me. The other I got along with really good. he was a great friend in that time but I felt wrong as I started to feel it was becoming more than just talking. The whole time my husband said I was fine as i told him everything but it didn't feel right to me, so I broke it off. 

At some point this all get to much for me and I recenter myself in this chaos and decide I need to set boundaries I sit him down with her and we have a conversation  that goes to the effects of me telling my husband and I had agreed that all sexual encounters would be together. She didn't want that, she also expects that I be willing to give but never receive sexual advances. That she want alone time both during sex and not with my husband. I say no it seems she wants my husband alone and not us as a couple. 

My husband and I get into another fight as I tell him to cut her off I'm done with that situation. I dont want an open relationship and if he does than we will be getting a divorce. So now we're back to having a monogamous relationship. I find out during the end of all this that I am pregnant. I was devastated. I didn't want to bring a baby into this specially knowing that they were created during a threesome I hated and can't forget. Knowing that I got pregnant just because he came in me instead of her that time kills me.

So we closed our relationship and I thought we'd get past the hardship ls and have our happy marriage now...... not so much. My husband then lost his job halfway through the year luckily he had a back up second job that he could jump into. We try to get caught back up but a month later our family gets into a car wreck while I'm  34 weeks pregnant. The oncoming car hit passenger headlight which is where I was. Totalled out the only vehicle that we had which was for a whole 3 hours max. ( other driver at fault) Were all physically okay for the most part no harm to baby.

We got that situation mostly sorted. Got a new vehicle that is also a piece of shit (bad luck still running strong).

I at this point i am just fed up. I take care of kids all day everyday with no break like bot even to the store, he's been working off and on but feels that's all he should be doing. No help around house or with kids. I dobhave to say he'll take out trash or swap the laundry. He'll also ask if I am in the middle of doing stuff if there's anything he can do to help but it's like at that point why ask. Also why do I have to tell him what needs to get done. 

This has been another point for me. I do stuff for him that he would never do for me........ I feel I put more in this relationship than him. I feel I could get past all of the chore shit if I was treated better but it feels like I'm don't think all for nothing.

I try to keep the house clean, go to school, keep all appointments, make bill payments, fill out all paperwork that ever appears. I try to even help him by running baths, get him coffee and sometimes breakfast in the morning depending how he feels i try take care of his personal need. If kids are overwhelming i try to give him space. I think the most telling thing is he has actually asked me why I do these things for him as he's wouldn't do it for me.

I am now at the point of I have gone through all of this just to be told I'll never get the same treatment I put out. 

Also one of the things he says bothers me some much. He will tel me all guys are like how he is and that everyone he's talk to says he's not in wrong.

Am I overreacting in feeling that everything I've gone through was for nothing. ",2,1737978499.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,1.0,False

MMA 54.0 ug/L & Vitamin B12 - Active 58 pmol/L. Poor diet?,"I first assumed that I may have autoimmune gastritis due to a recent endoscopy that I had to check on my Celiac disease. The report stated generalized atrophic gastritis and my Serum B12 was very low at 225ng/L. This then led me to discovering Pernicious Anaemia and paying for some private tests. My GP ordered IFAB and Parietal cell antibody which have both come back as negative. I have spoken to my gastroenterologist who has said that the biopsies that I had taken actually showed no atrophy and my stomach showed only mild reactive gastritis that as not progressed in just over a year. Therefore, I assume that i should have no issues with absorption. 

The private blood tests that I had reported increased MMA at 54.0 ug/L and active B12 at 58 pmol/L which according to NICE does indicate B12 deficiency. I am now thinking my diet might be the issue. For around 9 years I have messed about with unhealthy Yo Yo dieting and long periods of calorie restriction. Even when I am in a deficit my diet as been poor. I would probably eat 100g chicken 3 times per week. 80g of processed Ham each day. Milk in my coffee. Apart from that the rest of my food intake would be chocolate, rice and fruit. 

On this basis would you agree that my diet might be the issue and therefore a better diet / sublingual supplement B12 would raise my B12? 

Also I have hemochromatosis and I wouldnt say that I had any B12 deficiency symptoms.

It transcends languages, cultures, and borders, spreading joy and confidence wherever it goes. Yet, for over 50% of adults, smiling freely feels like a distant dream due to various dental concerns.

[Dental problems](https://www.dental101.in/) like misaligned teeth, discoloration, missing teeth, or gum issues not only impact aesthetics but also influence one’s confidence, social life, and overall well-being. If you’ve ever felt self-conscious about your smile, you’re not alone. Thankfully, modern dentistry offers solutions to help everyone regain the confidence to smile boldly.

Let’s explore why so many people avoid smiling, the impact it has on their lives, and the wide array of dental care options available to transform your smile.

# The Real Reasons Behind Smiling Less

Have you ever stopped to think about why people avoid smiling? It’s not a lack of happiness but rather concerns about how their teeth look or feel. Here are the primary dental issues that keep people from sharing their smiles:

# 1. Stained or Discolored Teeth

Consuming coffee, tea, wine, and smoking are common culprits for staining teeth. Poor oral hygiene and aging also contribute to discoloration, leaving people embarrassed to flash their smiles.

# 2. Misaligned Teeth

Crooked, overcrowded, or gapped teeth are some of the most common reasons adults feel self-conscious. Misalignment can occur naturally or due to habits like thumb-sucking in childhood.

# 3. Missing Teeth

Whether caused by decay, injury, or gum disease, missing teeth create noticeable gaps in your smile. This not only affects aesthetics but also functionality, such as chewing or speaking.

# 4. Gum Disease

Swollen, red, or bleeding gums are signs of gum disease. For many, this condition leads to pain and discomfort, making it hard to smile confidently.

# 5. Bad Breath (Halitosis)

Chronic [bad breath](https://www.dental101.in/post/what-causes-bad-breath-and-home-remedies-to-cure-it-naturally) can be a significant deterrent to socializing or smiling, often caused by poor oral hygiene, gum disease, or untreated cavities.

# The Hidden Costs of Not Smiling

Avoiding your smile has more far-reaching effects than you might realize. Beyond the cosmetic aspect, it impacts various facets of your life:

# 1. Emotional and Psychological Impact

A lack of confidence in your smile can lower your self-esteem and even lead to social withdrawal. Smiling triggers the release of endorphin hormones that promote happiness. By holding back your smile, you’re also holding back these feel-good emotions.

# 2. Social Perception

People who smile less are often perceived as less approachable or friendly. This can lead to missed opportunities for meaningful connections, whether in your personal or professional life.

# 3. Professional Growth

A confident smile is key in professional settings. It conveys trust, positivity, and competence. People who avoid smiling may unintentionally appear disinterested or unapproachable, affecting their career growth.

# 4. Oral Health Complications

Untreated [dental](https://www.dental101.in/) issues often escalate into more significant problems, including tooth decay, gum infections, or even tooth loss.

# Modern Solutions to Common Dental Problems

The good news? Modern dentistry has come a long way. Today’s dental solutions are effective, accessible, and often pain-free, ensuring there’s something for everyone.

# 1. Teeth Whitening for Radiance

Professional teeth whitening can remove years of stains in just one session. Options include:

* **In-office Whitening**: Delivers immediate results using advanced whitening agents.
* **Take-home Kits**: Gradual whitening at your convenience with dentist-supervised kits.

# 2. Aligners: The Clear Choice

Clear aligners like Invisalign have transformed orthodontics. These custom-made trays are designed to shift your teeth into the desired position discreetly.

* **Benefits**:
   * Virtually invisible
   * Comfortable and removable
   * Easy to clean

# 3. Braces: A Trusted Option

For those with severe alignment issues, braces remain a reliable solution. Today’s braces are more aesthetic, with options like ceramic or lingual braces for less visibility.

# 4. Dental Implants for Missing Teeth

Dental implants are a permanent solution for replacing missing teeth. They restore the natural look and function of your smile, making them a popular choice for adults.

# 5. Gum Treatments

For gum issues, treatments like scaling, root planing, or laser therapy can restore gum health and appearance. Addressing these issues early can prevent further complications.

# 6. Preventive Dental Care

The best way to maintain a confident smile is by preventing problems before they arise. Regular dental check-ups, professional cleanings, and good [oral hygiene](https://www.dental101.in/post/what-causes-bad-breath-and-home-remedies-to-cure-it-naturally) practices are essential for long-term oral health.

# Why You Should Visit a Dentist

A dentist isn’t just someone you visit when you’re in pain. They’re your partner in maintaining and enhancing your smile. Here’s what you can expect during a dental visit:

1. **Comprehensive Examination**: Your [dentist](https://www.dental101.in/) will evaluate your teeth, gums, and jaw to identify any issues.
2. **Personalized Care Plan**: Based on your needs, they’ll recommend treatments like whitening, braces, or aligners.
3. **Professional Advice**: Your dentist can guide you on maintaining good oral hygiene and preventing future problems.

# The Emotional Rewards of a Confident Smile

Fixing your smile doesn’t just change how you look it changes how you feel. Here are some of the emotional benefits of dental care:

* **Improved Self-Confidence**: A bright smile can make you feel unstoppable.
* **Greater Social Comfort**: You’ll no longer feel the need to cover your mouth while laughing or speaking.
* **Happier Outlook**: Smiling more often boosts your mood and overall well-being.

# Maintaining Your New Smile

Once you’ve achieved your dream smile, it’s crucial to keep it that way. Here’s how:

# 1. Practice Good Oral Hygiene

* Brush twice daily using fluoride toothpaste.
* Floss daily to remove food particles between teeth.

# 2. Visit Your Dentist Regularly

Schedule routine dental check-ups and cleanings every six months.

# 3. Eat a Balanced Diet

Limit sugary foods and beverages that can cause decay. Opt for teeth-friendly foods like crunchy fruits and vegetables.

# 4. Use Retainers

If you’ve undergone orthodontic treatment, retainers ensure your teeth don’t shift back.

# Debunking Common Myths About Dental Care

Many people avoid dental treatments due to misconceptions. Let’s bust a few myths:

* **Myth**: Braces are only for kids.
   * **Truth**: Adults can benefit from braces and aligners just as much as children.
* **Myth**: Teeth whitening damages enamel.
   * **Truth**: Professional whitening is safe and doesn’t harm enamel when done correctly.
* **Myth**: Dental care is unaffordable.
   * **Truth**: Many dentists offer flexible payment plans to make treatments accessible.

# Your Journey to a Healthier Smile Starts Today

1ib6ouk,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoFrance/comments/1ib6ouk/understanding_french_coffee_culture/,Understanding French coffee culture.,"## Understanding French Coffee Culture: More Than Just a Café au Lait

France. The land of love, art, and… incredibly rich coffee culture.  Forget the quick grab-and-go coffee you might find elsewhere; in France, coffee is an experience, a ritual, a crucial part of daily life.  Understanding this culture goes beyond simply ordering a café au lait. It's about embracing the *art de vivre*, the art of living well, one delicious sip at a time.

**Beyond the Menu: Decoding French Coffee Terminology**

The first hurdle? The menu itself.  Don't be intimidated! Here's a quick guide to some common French coffee types:

* **Café express:**  This is your standard espresso shot, the foundation of many other drinks.  Strong and intense, it's perfect for a quick caffeine boost.
* **Café crème:**  An espresso served with a generous layer of foamed milk.  Think of it as a smaller, more intense cappuccino.
* **Café au lait:**  This classic is exactly what it sounds like: coffee with milk.  Unlike a latte, the milk and coffee are usually in equal parts, resulting in a milder, creamier brew.
* **Café noisette:**  Similar to a café crème, but with just a small dollop of foamed milk, like a ""hazelnut"" of milk.
* **Macchiato:**  Just like in other coffee cultures, a macchiato in France is an espresso marked with a small amount of foamed milk.
* **Café allongé:**  A long espresso, essentially an espresso diluted with hot water.

**The Café Culture Experience**

More than just the coffee itself, the *café* is a social hub.  It's where people meet, chat, read newspapers, and simply observe the world go by.  Taking your time is part of the experience.  Don't feel rushed; savor your coffee, soak in the atmosphere, and enjoy the French *art de vivre*.

**Tips for a Smooth Coffee Experience:**

* **Learn basic French phrases:**  Even a simple ""Bonjour"" and ""Merci"" go a long way in showing respect and appreciation.
* **Observe local customs:**  People often sit at the bar for a quicker service and lower prices.  Table service is more leisurely.
* **Don't expect refills:**  Unlike in some American coffee shops, you generally pay for one cup at a time.
* **Be aware of tipping customs:**  Tipping isn't strictly obligatory, but rounding up the bill or leaving a small tip for exceptional service is appreciated.

**Beyond the Basics: Exploring Regional Variations**

France's diverse regions boast unique coffee traditions. You might find subtle differences in brewing methods or preferred coffee types depending on where you are.  Be adventurous and explore!


So, next time you find yourself in France, don't just grab a coffee; *experience* it. Embrace the culture, savor the moment, and allow yourself to be charmed by the rich and rewarding world of French coffee.  Bon appétit! (And yes, it's perfectly acceptable to use ""Bon appétit"" for a delicious coffee!)

Now he's stated ""life is not worth living"" and is more depressed than ever.

Before his diagnosis, he already:

\- Had complex trauma and PTSD

\- Had severe depression

\- Lacked the motivation to do literally anything daily, including care for himself and his house

\- Refused to speak to ANYONE about any problems he already had

He's also terrified because his brother-in-law has been diagnosed for a few years, and now his brother-in-law's memory is starting to decline even though he's still independent, able to drive, able to tend to his garden, and everything.

Is there any way the people he cares about (not me; I'm asking this because his wife asked me to, and she doesn't use Reddit) can help him?

He already WILL NOT:

\- Go to any support groups

\- Talk to anyone about it

\- Do anything he needs to do to physically help himself

\- Seek help for mental health issues that are worsening everything

He basically just gets up, goes out to get coffee/goes to any appointments he has, goes home, then sits on the couch watching TV all day. He's been like this for years, and now it's only going to get worse.

If anyone went through or knows someone who went through a depressive episode post-diagnosis, especially with pre-existing mental health issues, could you offer any advice about things that can be said/suggested to him to maybe help him realize life IS still worth living?

Note: His memory is fine, he's mobile, he can drive, and he WOULD be able to live independently if it weren't for his depression making him refuse to care for himself. His symptoms are mainly hand tremors and stiff muscles right now. He's quite lucky that he's had these same symptoms for over two years with no changes.

1ib6nlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/s/BnIxdYdepk,An update to my previous post,"So, we met. She was in the town for a few days for her cousin's wedding. This meeting happened last week. I was busy processing all that had happened so, couldn't post an update

I was nervous all the way to the café, palms sweating, heart racing. She had texted me the address, and I was trying so hard to act calm, but inside, I was panicking. When I arrived, she was already sitting by the window, and I couldn’t stop my mind from spiraling with all the ways this could go wrong. Our eyes met across the room, and I knew there was no turning back now. I approached the table, and she stood up. We shook hands, exchanged greetings, and sat down. For what felt like an eternity, we didn’t say a word. I was mortified. A couple awkward glances and forced smiles later, we finally ordered coffee and a sandwich.

She was the one to break the silence, asking how I’d been and genuinely wanting to know about my life since we’d lost touch. I rambled through my words, as if they really mattered, and turned the question back to her. She said she was fine, mostly happy, and we began talking about school, our college lives, and life in general. I tried to steer the conversation clear of the pandemic, but she asked about my dad—he was hospitalized during Covid because of his battle with cancer.

Then, her phone buzzed. As she glanced at it, I saw a selfie of her and some guy as her wallpaper. A sinking feeling hit me hard in the chest. Why was I even here? She had clearly moved on. I thought about what I was doing, if I was here for her or for myself. My mind wandered, but I snapped back to reality when my own phone rang.

After we finished brunch, we decided to take a walk. It was then that I knew I had to face the truth, to confess what had been eating at me. Our voices trembled as we spoke, both of us struggling to hold it together. She told me she wanted to focus on her career, to move forward from the past, and that I—along with everything else—had become a weight holding her back. She had met someone else, someone she loved deeply now. 

Honestly, I don’t remember much of what she said after that. My mind seems to be suppressing it, as if it’s trying to protect me from the truth.

I regretted coming here. I regretted reaching out to her in the first place. I was angry at myself for tormenting myself all these years, thinking she was still suffering because of me. But it was so much more complicated than that, and I’m not a therapist.

I saw the tears in her eyes, and I instantly felt guilty for breaking her peace. I consoled her, and we sat in silence for a while, until her phone rang—it was him. I couldn’t stay any longer. I pulled a note from my pocket, handed it to her, and left. The note had everything I couldn’t say aloud—how it wasn’t her fault, how she should stop punishing herself for what happened. I apologized for any pain I may have caused her.

Her reply was simple: “I’m sorry to have cut all connections. We should have talked. Bye.” And I’m okay with that. Some relationships are just never meant to be.

Sorry for the long post. I actually wanted to write more, but well, I'm tired. ",1,1737977801.0,OffMyChestIndia,1,1.0,False

This is my first time traveling to Thailand.

  
The plan, 2 weeks of playing tourist and exploring.  1 week of work (in between).

* I'm not a big party type. So no crazy hedonism for me.
* I'm a part-time chef, so I'd like to explore the markets, explore the food (street food, homestyle, fine dining), everything appeals to me.
* I train muay thai at home, and want to find coaching for private sessions.  I've been casually training for 7+ years. I'm far from being good.  I just want to avoid places that are too touristy and actually want to learn to improve my technique.



Also, this is also my first work-abroad trip.  It's pretty much a miracle I was able to convince my boss allow me a ""trial run"".

***I really need work to go flawlessly.***

I don't think I'm too fussy with what I need.  A moderately fast, stable internet connection (landline?), maybe aircon?

Probably what I'm most concerned about is where I can safely leave my laptop while I grab a coffee or use the facilities.  I don't want to have to keep packing up my gear, and setting it all up again during a work day.  So I suspect a cafe is probably out of the question.  But maybe a coworking space is overkill in cost?  Is there something in-between?  and I should just factor that into an airbnb?

  
I'm hoping you might have some thoughts and recommendations.

Initially I was thinking Bangkok and Changmai?  But I heard burning season and air pollution is pretty rough right now.

A creepy IT guy in my small town used to take photos of me playing netball as kid. He’s acted overly familiar with me despite barely knowing me. Before his recent surgery, he told a friend to delete everything on his computers if he died. Now I’m worried about what might be on them. Any advice?


When i was between the ages of 6-12 i would play Netball every Saturday at my local comp. Every game without fail there would be this one guy there taking photos of us. He had a big professional camera so we all thought that he might have been with the local newspaper taking photos for the sports section. It then became apparent that he wasn’t. 

I live in a really small rural town in Australia and as i got older i would see him around a lot. Without trying to sound mean, he looks like a creep. Overweight, long greasy hair and beard, just crusty looking in general. He looks like an incel stereotype. He works in IT with computers and is really intelligent as far as i know. 

I have had a few weird interactions with him where he acts as if he knows who i am, like working at a coffee shop and he would come in and be overly friendly like he is catching up with an old friend. Another time he was working at the entry gates of a festival and i used my Auntys ticket to get in as she wasn’t attending, and he looked at the ticket and gave me a weird look and said “this isn’t your name”. Keep in mind i’ve never told him my name and talked to him other than serving him at work. 

Today i found out that he recently had an intensive heart surgery, and before he went into his surgery, he gave his best friend his login to his multiple computers. He said to his friend, “if i die, you need to go and delete EVERYTHING”. 

I dont know what to make of this information. All i can think about is photos of my 6 year old self playing netball in a little skirt on his computer. I feel like i should do something. Any advice? ",2,1737977456.0,RBI,1,1.0,False

1ib6e6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/cambridge/comments/1ib6e6t/csar_lectures_all_welcome/,CSAR Lectures - all welcome,"Hi everyone, 

There is an organisation called CSAR which puts on lectures every few weeks. The lectures take place at Churchill college but they are for members of the public. 

There are a wide range of topics, which are presented by people who are experts in their fields. The lectures are pitched at a fairly basic level so you don't need to be a Phd to understand! 

It only costs £5 for entry and there are a lot of concessions for students etc. They provide tea, coffee, wine and biscuits before the lectures. 

I've been going to these for a few years and I really enjoy them. Unfortunately since Covid, I think there has been a big drop off in numbers attending as people's routines have changed and perhaps they aren't widely promoted. 

I really enjoy learning about a new topic from a world leading researcher. You have the option to ask questions and it's usually at quite a casual level which makes it comfortable for a non academic person. 

  
Tonight the lecture is about:

# Electric Jet Engines and Cricket Ball Swing

How research at the Whittle Laboratory is helping to deliver zero emission flight and uncover the mysteries of cricket ball swing.

1ib6cqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/1ib6cqn/my_bad_experience_working_at_target/,My bad experience working at Target,"I previously worked at the local Target. I’ve worked for over a dozen companies throughout my life with a variety of different job responsibilities and I have never had a work experience as horrible as my experience working at Target

I want to say that I’m not saying anything bad about Target as a company as a whole. I’ve been a customer there my entire life and enjoy shopping there. I also worked at 2 different locations and very much enjoyed working at the first one, however the Columbia Target is unfortunately a bad apple

I specifically worked in the Starbucks Department. I thought the people in the other departments seemed kind and mature, I am specifically talking about the Starbucks Department here. 

Those people working there were bullies. They were the meanest people I have ever met in my entire life. I had a co worker who laughed at another’s self harm scars, I had a co worker who was puffing they’re vape in the back and got too high and had to leave because they “felt sick”, everyday I would have a line of customers that I’d be dealing with on my own while my coworkers stood in the back and did nothing to help. I was constantly nice and helpful towards these people but they could never be bothered to help out anyone that works there. 

Yes they were young but it’s not right to say “what’d you expect working with young people”. These people couldn’t understand that most people don’t act this way or treat each other this way. Ive never worked any where else where the people acted the way they did here and I’ve worked with plenty of people the same age.

I had one person specifically who kept harassing me and bullying me for over 6 months. I tried asking for help, making a complaint but nothing worked. Eventually I had to quit my job because of this. This person for no reason decided they would do everything in their power to make me as sad and miserable as they can, and they did. 

Working with them was a nightmare, it destroyed my mental health. I kept hoping they would stop or someone would help but that never happened. They did everything they could to make that place a horrible environment for me and to turn people against me, they saw how much it was hurting me to be treated that way and didn’t care. I was nothing but nice to this person the entire time I worked there but because of their feelings they decided to make me miserable without stopping to think about how it was affecting me, it really hurt me deeply.

Management is also to blame. My etl and hr were too laid back and never did anything to help. It was nothing like this at the first target I worked at. My Starbucks manager saw what was happening and did nothing to help and just ignored the situation. She saw how hard of a worker I was and only used me to make her life easier. I wish I would’ve realized that sooner, I did so much to help her and she never even tried to help me. She enabled these people to act the way they did.

This situation, this experience was the worst work experience I’ve ever had and overall the worst experience of my entire life. It was a nightmare working here. I have never said this about anywhere I’ve worked at. It was completely different than the first Target I worked at.

Luckily since then I’ve worked at a few different places in Columbia that have all been great with really really kind, considerate and helpful people. People I’ve worked with in the past and since leaving Target have been good, I worked there so long that I let them convince me there was something wrong with me but that isn’t true, they were the bullies. I wish I would’ve left Target sooner.

I’m not trying to bad mouth anyone or hate on Target. I also am not discouraging people from working for this Target, lots of the people there are kind. I am however warning people from working in the Starbucks Department and I also want to warn people if your someone that looks for good management, management here is not going to do their jobs. Please go anywhere else. Those people were so mean. That place was horrible, I was bullied by the meanest people I’ve ever met and management and my some of my coworkers stood by and let it happen. I don’t understand how people can be like that…those people will never understand just how badly it affected me. Please go work at one of the local coffee shops instead

INGREDIENTS
CHOCOLATE CAKE
1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup good unsweetened cocoa powder
2 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. kosher salt
1 cup buttermilk, room temperature
1/2 cup vegetable oil
2 extra-large eggs room temperature
2 tsp. McCormick pure vanilla extract
1 cup freshly brewed hot coffee
FILLING
5 tbsp. all-purpose flour
1 cup whole milk
1 tsp. vanilla
1 cup (2 sticks) butter
1 cup granulated sugar
GANACHE
16 oz semi-sweet chocolate chopped fine (can use milk chocolate)
16 oz (2 cups) heavy cream room temperature
INSTRUCTIONS
CHOCOLATE CAKE
Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl and mix until combined.
In another bowl, combine the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla.
In the bowl of a stand mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry. With mixer still on low, add the coffee and stir just to combine, scraping the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
Pour the batter into two 8-inch x 3-inch round prepared pans and bake for 30-40 minutes at 350°F, until a cake tester or toothpick comes out mostly clean (not wet).
Cool in the pans for 30 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack and cool completely.
FILLING
Pour cold milk into a small saucepan. Before turning on the heat, whisk in flour so no lumps remain.
Turn heat on to medium-low and heat until mixture is thick, like a roux, stirring the whole time.
Remove from heat, stir in vanilla and let cool completely.
Cream together the butter and sugar on medium-high speed, until fluffy, about 8 minutes.
Add in the milk mixture and beat again until mixture resembles a whipped cream.
GANACHE
Heat the heavy cream in a quart-sized, microwavable container and microwave for 3 to 4 minutes on high, or until it just begins to simmer. Be careful not to allow the cream to boil over. Pour the cream over the chopped chocolate and let stand for at least 2 minutes so that it can thicken.
(Ganache should be cool when pouring over cake)
When ready to pour over chilled cake, whisk the ganache until smooth and then pour. You may have some ganache left over.",2,1737976648.0,DessertPorn,0,0.75,False

I'm attending therapy every week

Taking prescibed meds religiously

Went back to work full time, on-site mostly

Going out with friends (movie nights, RPGs) and taking myself to dates alone (cinema, coffee)

Spent holidays with his family, visited mine

I play games, read, watch some Netflix after long days at work, dance to the music I like, I laugh and joke

Take care of our animals

I do cry only sometimes, lightly, I think it's because the meds are making me less emotional

Still running errands related to his death

My libido is slowly rebuilding after years of being non-existent

Even developed a crush...

Sometimes I am active, sometimes I just want to stay home in silence, think

I'm searching for a new flat to rent as the current one will be put for sale by the owner

January was way worse than December. I have nightmares and migraines daily

I miss him like hell, I loved him deeply for who he was, gave my absolute all and beyond, fought like crazy for every day. I talk to him on the cemetery, at home, while walking. He's with me till my last breath. He's the one that showed me I can be loved.

At the same time, I wonder why am I functioning. It's painful to go and do things, but manageable. I wonder why does my world still move - I thought it would crumble, I thought there's nothing after day 0. But I still have hope... when I don't think I should have any. And this early? Two months?

1ib69jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1ib69jb/chaning_my_life_in_6_months/,Chaning my life in 6 months.,"Hey y'all!

I'm an 18-year-old high school student about to graduate in 2 months. I had some hefty plans for the coming year and started the new year on a good note. But that didn't last long. So, I'm re-doing my 2025. I've decided my new year starts on 1st Feb-and this time I'm doing it a bit different. Here's how:

The goal: I love travelling. Like no joke, serious travelling. And that's all I've wanted to do for so long. I thought once I finished high school, I would like to take a gap year and travel (frugal backpacking) Southeast Asia for 6 months. Since I've obsessed over this idea for long, I'm pretty certain of my budget and how much I'd need to have to go. And that, ladies and gents is my main goal. I want to leave on 31st July and travel through Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines and Indonesia until about end of January next year.

Anddddd these are my new resolutions!

1. Finances: The main reason why I've chosen SE Asia and not Europe is because of the general cost and viability for a first-time backpacker. I'm hoping I can do it under 6000 US dollars. That includes, hostels every night, maybe even camping etc., local food, cheap buses/scooters and no alcohol/coffee/shopping: basically, anything that costs a lot of money. It's a difficult budget, I'm aware, but not impossible. I'm also not averse to the idea of hitchhiking or world packers. But the bad news here is: I got 0 dollars in my bank account. Yep. Ok, maybe more like around 100. That's my biggest aim. Chase those cheques!
2. Health: I want to improve my eyesight. It's not that bad, but I need glasses. (1.5 in both eyes). My mom improved hers, so I know how...I just need to wake up an hour earlier and actually do it. I'd also like to get back into exercising. I was very big on that, swimming, polo, running, but the winters here are so bad I practically live in my bed. (Brr)
3. School :( Yes, that too. (Screaming) I need to score above 95 per cent in my finals to every suggest this absurd idea of travelling to my parents. Plus, I need the grade if I want to come back next year and give a few competitive exams for the top colleges.
4. Career: Not something you'd expect on this list but here it is. My dream is to become a writer. No scratch that. My goal is to become a writer. I've already written 2 full length novels (above 80k each), one of which was a finalist in an international writing contest. I'm working on my 3rd and 4th right now. I want at least one book deal for one of these. Where I'm from, having a literary agent isn't a requirement so I've submitted it to several publishing houses, just waiting to hear back from them.
5. Personal: Delete social media and stick to it for god's sake. Mediate once in a while.

That's pretty much it, I think. Now here's how I'll do it.

I've realized that my main issue is that I have absolutely no balance in life. I tend to work for 14 hours in one day and crash out for the next week, go down a spiral of stress and worry and think I'm a loser. Well, let's fix that. First, I'm adopting a 1% mindset. No, I'm not a motivational guru but I do like this idea. Repeat after me: we do not have to do everything in one day, growth it gradual.

Next, balance. I plan to divide my day into blocks of 8. Eight hours of sleep, eight of free time and eight of work. During my free time, I'll spend time with my family, my friends, exercise, meditate, try not to have a panic attack.

During my work time, I'll study, write, apply to writing gigs. (I have already to tons of places). I want to score some sort of a freelancing gig during Feb. Just find something. Anything. PLEASE GOD. Then I'll spend the rest- no that's it.

And the last eight hours will be spent joyfully asleep. Not much to say about that.

That's it folks. You may wonder why I'm posting this on reddit out of all places, and to be honest, I just want some accountability in my life. I'll update every month and let's see where we go. And yeah, any advice?

""Yawn!"" Yet another morning in the world of me, Garfield mused while slumping over his pillow. Birds chirped outside, and he glares at them. Must they make a racket when he was being lazy? The nerve of those stupid birds, who did they think they were? Garfield then thought of something that would cheer up his mood. Breakfast!


He immediately got up, not quickly, but he did manage to lift himself from his comfortable bed. The feline went into the kitchen and hoped on the tabletop, staring indifferently up at Jon who was drinking his morning coffee.


Jon arched a brow, but distinctly knew exactly what Garfield was thinking about. He took out a can-opener and poured his cat food out in his bowl. Garfield crinkled his nose, as if uninterested in his mushy cat food. He would prefer Tuna Fish this morning, but how on earth could Jon be capable of knowing that. After all he was a human. At any rate, he ate it until it was empty. Then he carried himself outside to find a place to laze about at.


""Well, this is fun."" He said unenthusiastically while shielding his eyes from the sun. His orange fur glinted in the sunrays. He groaned, and sauntered over to a comfortable looking spot near the flowerbed. Plopping down on the ground he circled the area that he planned on sleeping at and finally made up his decision, and laid down. His tail curled up beside him, tickling his nose. ""This is the life."" He murmured.


Just as his sleep was about to take wing, an obnoxious barking erupted. Lifting one eyelid he takes a peek at what Odie could possibly do this time. Did he not realize that this was a ""non"" disturbing section?

Odie raced over, running at Garfield with full speed. ""This can't be good.""


SMACK!


Garfield saw beautiful stars floating above his head. He leaned up weakly and glared at the mutt that called himself Odie. But the dog was far too busy with his own task. Digging up the flowers. Garfield blinked blankly as Odie pulled the flowers from the ground and held them in his jaw. He scurried off indoors happily with his bouquet of flowers, which still had the roots.


Curious, the orange tabby quickly followed him. When he entered the kitchen Jon took the flowers from Odie's mouth and examined them, then patted Odie on the head and threw him a cookie. ""Good boy Odie, the new neighbors will love these!""


Garfield looked at the cookie that was at his feet. Odie whimpered, knowing all to well that food around Garfield could never be good. Alas, Garfield picked up the treat and claimed it as his own, in the pit of his stomach. The tabby licked his furry fingers and smiled satisfied. Then he looked at Odie and smiled, ""Don't worry, you did the right thing."" Odie glared at him. ""Remember your diet? I just did you a favor."" Garfield insured him, and walked over to Jon. Odie scratched his head, puzzled. He didn't recall being on a diet. But if Garfield said so, then it must be true!


Garfield cocked his head at Jon, wondering what on earth he was doing. Let's see Garfield rubbed his chin thoughtfully. Jon had on a suit, a tie, and had a batch of flowers. Oh no! It couldn't be a date? Garfield thought, horrorstruck. Nah, that was ridiculous!


This was worth investigating though. He blinked; looking up at his master who was fixing his tie to make sure it was straight. Then he ran into the other room, came back five minutes later, and the process seemed to go on like that for a while in that exact pattern.


""I'm going next door to greet the neighbors. I'll be back soon. Be good you two!"" He gave them a look of warning if they did not heed his word, then left.


Garfield and Odie looked at each other in an awkward silence. ""I'm going to sleep."" Garfield declared, and went straight to bed.",0,1737975807.0,Bombstrap,4,0.5,False

Furet off, when I mean cheap i mean around 10€ to about 40€. Not on discounts getting into these ranges but more regular price point within this range etc. 

Whats your favourite cheap fragrance? What fragrance have you been amazed by thar has a low price point? What parfume would you recommend to someone else that has a low price point but good quality? 

To start of, a few examples I can think of would be:

- Mont Blanc Legend Spirit 
Fresh allround fragrance that has good quality and a good price (albeit have gotten more pricy)

- Mandarina Duck Vida Loca
A tropical fragrance, reminds me of JPG Le Beau

- Karl Lagerfeld Bois d'ambre
In the same ballpark as The One but lighter and more all-round in my opinion 

- Halloween Man X
A warm, bit spicy coffee fragrance with good quality for the price

We met on Hinge and agreed to keep it casual because our life paths were changing soon. She’s moving south in April and I plan to move out west by the Fall (we’re in the US for more insight lol), so both of us knew our time was short. What we didn’t prepare for was the strong connection that was starting to grow. I went in thinking “yeah, just another fling that probably won’t go anywhere”. Jokes on me lol. It turned out to be such an amazing time together and we learned so much from each other. Our personalities flowed so well and the connection we had was so genuine. We always made time to see each other throughout the week, had a couple snowboarding trips together, and our feelings towards each other were getting stronger. I knew I couldn’t let myself get further and I really had to protect myself.

Fast forward to this past week. I dropped off a coffee and lunch for her at work, got some stuff done, then met her for dinner/played some cards at a brewery. Our normal thing is that we always smoke a joint before we go home for the night, and we usually get into some sort of deep conversation. I started emotionally peaking here, my walls were starting to crack and I was like “oh fuck I can’t let this happen to me”. We saw each other again Wednesday for trivia and from then I noticed a huge shift. Vibes were just off so I had a feeling our talk was coming soon. Sunday comes around and I get the text apologize for being distant, spent time to herself unpacking her own feelings, and wanted to see each other to discuss. She told me she wrote out her feelings to help process and wanted to share it with me before we saw each other (which for me is so helpful to not react immediately and also genuinely process both hers and my feelings).

The text basically said since she’s moving in two months and she has so much to take care of before she goes, the time for starting more with us is just unreasonable and not fair. She said “it’s definitely not sitting well with me that I don’t have the time or headspace to give a relationship what it needs and I just wanted to address this before our feelings get more invested”. We both had our shit to deal with and hers was coming up sooner. Our paths are so different right now and continuing on would be difficult. I couldn’t see myself trying to make this work because of what I have on my plate (focusing on my career, plans to move out west, basically giving myself a new life) and managing more on my end would probably kill me! 

We met up for dinner at our go-to spot as our last hurrah, and the first thing she says is “I don’t want you to think I’m un-emotional right now but I’ve been crying all day about this”, then I tell her I basically had been too knowing that this was it for us. We smoked our joints (two back to back to ease the pain lmao), cried with each other, told each other how happy we were to have crossed paths, and we wished each other nothing but good things to come. We sang our hearts out to sad love songs (we love car karaoke) and just enjoyed each other’s company one last time. We compared what we were as parallel lines, always close but never together. That will stick with me for a lifetime. If we didn’t rip this bandaid now and we let our feelings get deeper by the time she left, this feeling would easily be much stronger and harder for me to bounce back from.

This was harder than a breakup. My heart is so heavy for a person who has opened my eyes so much in such a short period of time, but I’m proud of myself for truly enjoying the time we spent and allowing myself to not get in over my head with anxious thoughts and these deep feelings. Knowing our timeline was short made the letdown easy, but god it still hurts. I’m proud of myself for remaining self-aware, not letting my feelings grow deeper, and allowing myself to be okay with how it played out. I’ll probably be thinking about the what-could-have-been forever, but at least I can always think back to how awesome of a time it was.

My neurologist at one point told me its highly unlikely to be epilepsy, and then told me it’s most likely psychological. Immediately asked to be transferred to an epileptologist. I had a whole word document ready, to back my defence and explain why it’s extremely unlikely its psychological, why I’m confident in it being focal epilepsy, etc. 

The epileptologist could see I put a lot of effort into the document so he let me finish, then said “you don’t have to do that anymore, I trust you”, diagnosed me right there and then. But still said that the visuals I get could be psychological as they didn’t show up on an EEG. Which to me is worrying, I feel like I have to defend myself again. I don’t feel like I’m psychologically ill in any way. And it’s a real coincidence that the light is the exact same light that develops into a bigger brighter light that then develops into a TC.

Picture this: You’re a digital marketer gearing up for your next big campaign. Everywhere you turn, you’re bombarded with headlines promising that artificial intelligence (AI) will revolutionize your work. They say AI will craft the perfect ad, deliver flawless targeting, and save you time and money. It’s tempting to believe that AI is a magic wand that will solve all your marketing woes. But is it really?

Take Raj’s story, for example. Raj, the owner of a small artisanal coffee shop, jumped on the AI bandwagon, hoping to drive sales. He invested in AI-powered tools for personalized ads and automated social media posts. But after six months, the results were underwhelming. Why? Because Raj expected AI to do everything for him, forgetting that successful marketing requires a blend of technology and human creativity.

For businesses like Raj’s or even a [***digital marketing agency in Delhi***](https://ksixinternational.in/), the gap between AI expectations and reality can be challenging. Let’s explore the world of AI in digital marketing, dissect the expectations, and uncover the reality behind the hype.

Let’s explore the world of AI in digital marketing, dissect the expectations, and uncover the reality behind the hype.

# The Hype: What We Expect AI to Do in Digital Marketing

**Expectation 1: AI Will Replace Human Creativity**

Marketers often dream of a world where AI tools like ChatGPT or DALL-E handle everything — writing blog posts, designing visuals, and creating entire campaigns. The belief? AI can replicate human creativity with precision.

**Expectation 2: Perfectly Targeted Campaigns**

Another common expectation is that AI will create campaigns so accurate they’ll feel psychic. From predicting customer behavior to delivering personalized content, marketers assume AI can eliminate guesswork entirely.

**Expectation 3: Cost-Effective and Easy Implementation**

Many businesses, especially smaller ones, believe AI tools are affordable and user-friendly. The promise of instant ROI makes it seem like a no-brainer investment.

But here’s the reality: AI is not a one-size-fits-all solution. To understand its true potential, let’s look at how it actually performs in real-world scenarios.

# The Reality: What AI Actually Delivers

**Reality 1: AI Enhances, But Doesn’t Replace, Human Creativity**

While AI is great at generating ideas, it lacks the emotional depth and cultural context that humans bring to storytelling. Take Raj’s coffee shop, for instance. The AI tool suggested generic coffee-related slogans, but Raj’s customers connected more with a heartfelt Instagram video sharing the journey of his head barista. AI can assist, but it can’t replicate the authenticity of human creativity.

**Reality 2: Accuracy Isn’t Foolproof**

AI relies on data — and data can be messy. Predictive analytics might suggest targeting a specific demographic, but it can overlook nuances like cultural differences or shifting trends. For example, an AI-powered email campaign for a clothing brand might target young adults but fail to recognize that many older customers also love their products.

**Reality 3: High Costs and Technical Challenges**

Implementing AI isn’t as simple as plugging in a tool. Many businesses underestimate the costs of training AI models, integrating them with existing systems, and maintaining them. Raj, for example, found himself overwhelmed by the technical requirements and ended up hiring an expert — an expense he hadn’t anticipated.

# Balancing Expectations with Reality

**1. Start Small and Scale Gradually**

Don’t dive into AI headfirst. Experiment with affordable tools like Canva for design automation or HubSpot for marketing analytics. Use these to solve small, specific problems before scaling up.

Think of AI as your assistant, not your replacement. Use it to handle repetitive tasks like email segmentation or A/B testing. This frees up time for your team to focus on strategy and creativity.

**2. Focus on Augmenting, Not Replacing, Human Efforts**

Think of AI as your assistant, not your replacement. Use it to handle repetitive tasks like email segmentation or A/B testing. This frees up time for your team to focus on strategy and creativity.

**3. Invest in Training and Ethical Practices**

AI tools are only as good as the people using them. Train your team to understand the technology and its limitations. Additionally, prioritize ethical AI use by ensuring transparency and respecting customer privacy.

# Real-World Success Stories of AI in Digital Marketing

**1. Netflix: Personalized Recommendations**

Netflix’s AI-driven recommendation system is a game-changer. By analyzing viewing habits, it suggests content tailored to each user’s preferences, boosting engagement and retention.

**2. Coca-Cola: AI-Powered Ad Campaigns**

Coca-Cola uses AI to analyze customer data and create hyper-personalized ad campaigns. One notable campaign used AI to design custom labels for millions of bottles, driving a 12% increase in sales.

**3. Sephora: Virtual Assistants for Customer Experience**

Sephora’s AI-powered virtual assistants provide personalized beauty advice, helping customers find the right products. This innovative approach has significantly enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty.

# The Future of AI in Digital Marketing

AI is evolving rapidly, and its potential is immense. Emerging trends include:

* **Conversational AI:** Tools like chatbots are becoming more human-like, offering better customer interactions.
* **Generative AI:** Platforms like MidJourney and ChatGPT are pushing creative boundaries.
* **Real-Time Data Analytics:** AI is improving its ability to analyze data instantly, enabling real-time decision-making.

The key to leveraging AI in the future lies in collaboration. Marketers who combine AI’s capabilities with human intuition and creativity will thrive.

# Conclusion: AI Is a Partner, Not a Savior

AI is not a magic wand that will solve all your marketing challenges. It’s a powerful tool that, when used correctly, can enhance your efforts and drive meaningful results. But the heart of every successful campaign remains human — the creativity, empathy, and authenticity that AI cannot replicate.

So, what story will your brand share today? Remember, every click could be the start of something extraordinary. Take the leap, but keep your feet firmly on the ground.

# FAQs About AI in Digital Marketing

**1. Can AI completely replace marketers?**

No, AI is a tool that complements human efforts. While it can automate tasks and provide insights, creativity and strategic thinking remain irreplaceable.

**2. What are the best AI tools for small businesses?**

Affordable tools like Canva (design), HubSpot (analytics), and Mailchimp (email marketing) are great starting points for small businesses.

**3. Is AI worth the investment for startups?**

Yes, but start small. Invest in tools that solve specific problems and scale as your business grows. Ensure you have the resources to manage and maintain AI systems.

**4. What are the ethical concerns around AI in marketing?**

Ethical concerns include data privacy, transparency, and avoiding biases in AI models. It’s crucial to use AI responsibly and comply with regulations like GDPR.

**5. How can I measure the success of AI in my marketing campaigns?**

Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like ROI, customer engagement, lead conversions, and campaign effectiveness. Use analytics tools to gain actionable insights.

My past story: I once went out with a very attractive girl a few times, and the first date was a disaster. Although we connected incredibly well by chatting online. I went on a date and had to do around 80% of the work. I was new and sort of dumb haha I didn't take her for a coffee as didn't take any money so went for a walk which was fine as were going to do that anyway, but I run out of things to ask after 40 minutes and we went to hide in a sport clothes store as it was pouring down, unfortunately instead of going with me to look at stuff, when I asked if we should come in more she said, ""you go ahead, I'll just stay here"". So I didn't and just stayed with her standing in awkward silence (for about 20 minutes) in front of it, sheltering from rain. We continued our walk after, but not long after that, she made up an excuse to leave (some parcel delivery that she forgot about, and I'm sure it was an excuse to leave).

So, how do I avoid times like these? This put me off big time from meeting",1,1737975051.0,Bumble,4,1.0,False

Hey guys, so me and my ex (we’re both over 30 yo)
Broke up in 2021 after dating for 2 years. The relationship was not great. We was an avoidant and that would trigger my attachment issues to the core. We would have great days but also some very very bad arguments. Eventually he initiated the break up and I had to agree, back then I was completely heart broken, I would beg and pleed him to reconsider and get back, but he just didn’t want it. 

It took me almost 2 years and multiple therapy sessions later to realise that why I would act out the way I did. I had to really work on my self respect and insecurities and honestly I’m in a much better mental health spot, and I’m glad that the relationship didn’t workout because we both deserved better. 

After the break up neither of us went full on ‘no contact’ one of us would budge every 4-6 months and send in a ‘hey, what’s up’ text and check up on each other. We’ve know each other since 2009 and we felt that we can maintain a bit of friendship and move on with our lives separately. 

4 years have passed since our breakup and we’ve met thrice over coffee, and in one of those meetings in 2023 he told me that he’s been dating someone.
NGL hearing that Hurt and I did have a little cry when I got back home, but in 2-3 days I was fine. I knew he’s not the person I want to be with anymore. He’s a text book definition of love bombing during the start of the relationship and then eventually taking it all away little by little, while you sit there and cry and create a fuss, so that he can label you  ‘toxic and attention seeker’ .

Anyhow, I was fine with him having a GF and that fact didn’t bother me anymore. After this whole gf reveal thing we met twice- once in Feb 2024 and the next time in Oct 2024. Both the times he was adamant to meet up and would FaceTime me and text to make plans.
 Last year I decided to not wish him happy birthday in Oct, so he made it a point to call and text me and asked me to wish him.like wtf 

Since the day he’s told me he has a new GF he only complains about her. He says he’s not happy, she doesn’t care for him, his mom still misses me, he’s gonna breakup with her, he gets drawn easily to any woman that gives him attention .Etc etc and I just sit there listening to all this crap and nodding. 
 I think he still takes me to be that immature, insecure girl I was back in 2019 who he could manipulate and trigger, but sadly for him I look through his bullcrap and I don’t fall for all this. 

Coming back to the last time we met/ texted / FaceTimed (Oct 2024) after meeting up that day for lunch, this guy video calls me at 2 am, tells me that he misses me, how my fragrance bought back all the memories and the conversation went a bit NSFW. 

 After that night neither of us called or texted each-other and we’ve again been in ‘no contact’ . 
Last night while scrolling through Instagram I saw he’s changed his PFP with him and his GF. We don’t follow each other on socials and this guy hadn’t changed his pfp in 2 decades. And now all of a sudden I see him with his hands wrapped around her waist, smiling. 
Like bro are you for real?? Every single time we met you’ve bad mouthed that woman, if I would leave without hugging him he would tell me that he felt hurt. He constantly  told me this time it’s “over” with her like I give a big F about it. Which woman in the right frame of mind would want a man like that. But now I see him with her, gleaming. And I was like ok I’m done. 

So I’ve finally blocked, this man is a big big red flag,but I don’t need this toxic energy in my life, he just can’t be honest with anyone. Including himself .

Geee I’ve written too much maybe I just had to vent. thanks guys

I'm in the middle of looking at purchasing a coffee machine/grinder for our home. We don't have a strict budget (but say up to  AUD $15,000ish), which is allowing me to look at some nice combinations.

One of the major considerations is ease of use as my wife will be using it a lot. With this mind, I think for the grinder im pretty set on a Mahlkonig E65S GBW Grinder. I'm really not interested in a single dose system.

For the machine, im seriously considering a GS3 AV for the volumetric; again I want to make things as simple as possible.

Now for the silly questions I'm hoping to get answers to:

1. I was looking at the LM Mini, with the GBW, but I can get the GS3 for $1,200 more then a Mini. The GS3 is a new machine from a reseller. My view is for a small premium, the GS3 would be a better machine than the Mini? Any reason I should go with the Mini over the GS3?
2. one of the main issues (to be honest its a big one) is how long it has been since the GS3 has been updated. I can't find anything on the net, but perhaps someone here has a line on if an update is in the pipeline, and more-so, what will be updated?

Part of me, says its a rock solid machine that just produces amazing coffee and thats why it hasn't been updated (in other words it doesn't need to be changed), but I suspect it would annoy me no end if an update turns up in the short term. Especially given the cost of the machine.

3) does any one have any alternatives for a volumetric machine I could look at.

4) Is there any reason the GS3 and E65S wouldn't be a good combination?

1ib5kmi,https://i.redd.it/myjvryntlife1.jpeg,Challenges with bottom paper filter and decaf,"I started using a bottom paper filter recently. I wet the paper in the basket and I use a blind shaker for puck prep. 

With most of the coffees I’ve tried it works well but I’ve noticed that with decaf beans the filter chokes the shot. See the attached flow chart for an example, this is with the grind about 75 microns coarser than I would normally use for the same bean.

I wonder if this is because the decaf puck is more soluble which allows more fines migration into the paper. Even grinding coarser still results in choked shots. I don’t think it’s grinder-related; I have a reasonable grinder (EG-1).

It’s interesting because with caffeinated coffee I get a slightly faster shot with the bottom paper, and haven’t had any issues with choking.

Has anyone else had a similar experience or have any theories regarding this?

1ib5jes,https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1ib5jes/cured_of_gluten_intolerance/,Cured of gluten intolerance,"Hi everyone I just want to share how I reversed my gluten intolerance which I struggled with for the best part of a decade.

My intolerance started a bit earlier, with bad gas and a pain in my lower left abdomen after eating foods that contained wheat or drinking beer. It took a while for me to realize gluten might be the cause, and as soon as I started consuming gluten free products it went away.

The sensitivity got worse over time, to the point where I considered getting tested for celiac diseases. Even a few drops of conventional soya sauce would cause a cascade of physiological and even psychological symptoms. I could easily tell if beers marketed as gluten free were the real deal by my reaction to them.

Accidental exposures happened fairly often, mainly because while many pizza joints in my area offer a gluten free base they tend to bake the pizzas in ovens where other pizza bases have been. I would also get exposed via frying oil at places that cooked crumbed foods in their oil alongside french fries which I ordered.

I tried everything under the sun to get rid of this issue, which I blamed on my immune system, which tended to flare up all the time. I made my own kimchi, kefir, sauerkraut and kombucha to support my gut, I consumed a lot of collagen to heal my gut, and went through a massive number of different supplements and supplement stack variations. I can confidently say I have tried 90% of the different herbs, vitamins and minerals on the market.

For most of this period the only thing I did that reversed flare ups and felt like it helped my general immune system reactivity was to fast. I did 36 hour water fasts once a week, and fasts of up to 96 hours once a quarter. While I would feel very healthy after these fasts, it didn't solve the core issue.

Fast forward to August last year when I heard how someone had cured their immune system disorder on the lion diet. I was skeptical but willing to give it a shot in a more moderate format, so I did one month of the carnivore diet, allowing myself all animal products with the addition of one cup of filter coffee a day.

I was quite underwhelmed by the experience, I didn't have the high energy or weight loss other people report, and eventually felt rather exhausted and had a craving for fruit, so dropped off it and started eating fruits and vegetables again.

I didn't notice anything dramatic until Christmas when, under the influence, I decided to eat an imported German ginger cake which I loved as a kid, deciding to ride out the consequences. It had no negative effects. Encouraged by this I tried out a few different beers (which I have been missing), and no effect there.

I decided not to push the issue and stuck to my usual gluten-free product range until confronted by a moist chocolate cake at a family meeting, where I proceeded to eat a thick slice of cake.

No after-effects at all.

Previously I would have looked at two weeks of intestinal discomfort and associated symptoms like gas and loose stool. This time there was no change in my digestion.

It's still kind of hard to believe and I don't want to push it, so will stick to my current diet, but may allow myself the odd indulgence in future.

I believe that what happened here has to do with changes in my gut biome during the carnivore diet period. It somehow changed the complexion of my gut biome, and may have killed of yeasts or bacteria that were messing with my ability to consume gluten.

Please note that I am not an advocate for the carnivore diet - I find the movement as a whole quite cringe and radical, but it does seem to have some benefit as a short-term elimination diet. Another thing that healed during this period without me even noticing was an issue I had with a fractured coccyx - it had been bothering me for 2 years with no signs of healing, and it vanished like mist after I came off the carnivore diet.

I hope this helps - I have spent a fortune trying to get rid of this issue, and the solution turned out to be rather simple.",0,1737974160.0,glutenfree,3,0.29,False
1ib5ic9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1ib5ic9/the_minimalists_guide_to_choosing_functional_and/,The Minimalist's Guide to Choosing Functional and Stylish Furniture,"Minimalism is more than just a trend—it’s a lifestyle that emphasizes simplicity, functionality, and intentional design. For those who value clean lines, clutter-free spaces, and timeless aesthetics, choosing the right furniture is essential. Whether you’re furnishing an indoor space or creating an inviting outdoor oasis, this guide will help you strike the perfect balance between form and function.

# 1. Start with Multi-Functional Furniture

Minimalism thrives on efficiency, and multi-functional furniture pieces are a minimalist’s best friend. Look for items that serve dual purposes, such as storage ottomans, sofa beds, or dining tables with extendable features.

**Outdoor Tip:** For your patio or balcony, [rattan outdoor furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan) is a smart choice. Not only does it offer durability, but it also brings an earthy, natural vibe that complements minimalist design. A sleek rattan outdoor coffee table with hidden storage can keep your space tidy and stylish.

# 2. Prioritize Quality Over Quantity

Minimalism isn’t about having less—it’s about having better. Invest in high-quality furniture that lasts. Choose timeless materials like wood, metal, and rattan, which pair beautifully with minimalist interiors and exteriors.

**Functional Highlight:** Opt for a versatile [outdoor armchair](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/seating/outdoor-armchairs) that offers both comfort and sophistication. Neutral colors like beige, grey, or charcoal can seamlessly blend with your minimalist aesthetic while standing up to outdoor conditions.

# 3. Keep it Neutral and Balanced

Minimalist design often features neutral tones and subtle textures. Stick to a color palette of whites, greys, and earthy tones for a harmonious look. Incorporate texture through natural materials like rattan or linen to keep the space from feeling too sterile.

**Dining Essential:** If you’re updating your dining area, consider sleek [bar chairs Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools) that offer ergonomic design and understated elegance. Choose bar chairs with clean lines and sturdy materials like metal or wood, ensuring they complement your minimalist theme without overpowering it.

# 4. Choose Space-Saving Outdoor Furniture

Outdoor spaces can benefit greatly from minimalist design. Whether you have a small balcony or a spacious garden, choosing space-efficient furniture is key. Foldable chairs, stackable tables, and lightweight materials make it easy to create a minimalist outdoor retreat.

**Outdoor Idea:** [Rattan furniture UAE](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan) is an excellent choice for minimalist outdoor settings. Its lightweight yet durable design makes it ideal for compact spaces. Consider a modular rattan sofa set that can be rearranged to suit your needs while maintaining a sleek and streamlined look.

# 5. Embrace Versatility in Seating

Seating is a crucial element in minimalist spaces. Opt for furniture that adapts to different settings without compromising style.

* **Indoors:** Go for armchairs with slim profiles or sectional sofas that can be reconfigured for various layouts.
* **Outdoors:** A well-designed outdoor armchair with a modern silhouette can work equally well in a garden or balcony setup.

# 6. Incorporate Statement Pieces Thoughtfully

Minimalism doesn’t mean sacrificing personality. A single statement piece can add character to a space without disrupting the clean aesthetic. For example, a sculptural chair, a unique coffee table, or an elegant light fixture can serve as a focal point.

**Bar Charm:** For a minimalist kitchen or outdoor bar area, look for chic bar chairs in Dubai with a contemporary design. High-quality bar chairs with slim metal legs or rattan accents can elevate the space while keeping it uncluttered.

# 7. Stay Eco-Friendly and Mindful

Minimalism aligns well with sustainability. By choosing eco-friendly materials like rattan, bamboo, or reclaimed wood, you not only reduce your environmental impact but also add timeless beauty to your home.

**Eco-Inspiration:** Rattan furniture in the UAE is perfect for those looking to incorporate sustainable materials into their minimalist designs. Its lightweight and eco-conscious nature make it a go-to choice for functional and stylish interiors or outdoor spaces.

# Minimalist Furniture Picks for Every Space

1. **Living Room:** Low-profile sofas, nesting tables, and multi-purpose shelving units.
2. **Bedroom:** Platform beds with built-in storage and simple bedside tables.
3. **Outdoor:** A mix of rattan outdoor furniture, lightweight outdoor armchairs, and stackable seating options.
4. **Dining Room:** Minimalist dining tables with bar chairs from Dubai for a sophisticated touch.

# Final Thoughts

Choosing functional and stylish furniture as a minimalist doesn’t mean compromising on comfort or elegance. With thoughtful planning and a focus on high-quality, versatile pieces, you can create a space that feels spacious, harmonious, and inviting. Whether it’s incorporating rattan furniture in the UAE or investing in sleek bar chairs in Dubai, the right choices will help you achieve your minimalist dream.

One of my worries comes from my constant heart palpitations (PVCs) that I’ve had since 2017, and recently my cardiologist had me wear a heart monitor for a couple of weeks which showed that 23% of my heart beats are PVCs, I find this pretty alarming. I was prescribed Metoprolol ER 12.5mg and I started taking it on the 13th.

But before I took it for the first time on the 13th, on the 11th I had a very severe case of diarrhea which only lasted about 10 minutes, I thought it was from the Mac and cheese I ate a couple hours before that. Then, I took the Metoprolol on the 13th and since then I’ve been having diarrhea every. single. day. It usually wakes me up super early in the morning and I’m on the toilet for about 10-15 minutes with several bouts of diarrhea. This has been going on for over two weeks. 

I called my cardiologist on the 22nd and asked if I could stop taking it and I tapered down as my doctor directed me. Friday the 24th was my final day taking it and I’m STILL having diarrhea… 

This has been so stressful and I find myself googling things all day trying to pinpoint the cause of this sudden diarrhea. Something to note is that I’m usually type of person who has constipation, diarrhea has never been an issue for me in the past. So I don’t think my diarrhea is caused by my anxiety. I also quit drinking coffee cold turkey on the day I started the metoprolol (I only ever had one cup a day so not a heavy coffee drinker) so I’m not sure if that has an effect on anything. According to google, Metoprolol can cause diarrhea but I have no clue if it can cause diarrhea for this long? 

Anyways, I’m just feeling so stressed and overwhelmed with this and I know the obvious answer is to go to the doctor, I’m definitely going to be doing that this week.

1ib5hlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/badbreath/comments/1ib5hlt/help/,help,"hi, i have had a bb since i was 7th grade and now im on 10th grade, when i was a child i refused to brush my teeth (regret it so much) so my teeth had cavities and lots of holes in my teeth. but that's all fixed, and all my bad teeth are gone. my sister said my breath smells like shit this really bothers me in socializing, I have difficulty talking to my friends because of this bad breath. every night I cry thinking about it, I find out about this and it turns out that there are many things that can cause bad breath. I don't know which one causes my mouth to smell.  I seem to have a stomach acid problem because since I was little I had a bad diet, like drinking iced coffee twice a day no matter whether I've eaten it or not, I also really like spicy food and I often eat rambutan, maybe a kilo in one sitting. . could that be what's causing my bad breath? but I also seem to have sinusitis because I always have a flu every day.  Tonsil stones may also be the cause because someone told me I had tonsil stones. The symptoms of stomach acid that I have are just my stomach is bloated after eating, my stomach hurts if I haven't eaten it and an unpleasant feeling in my throat after I eat. My sinus symptoms are a runny nose every day and sometimes a headache for no reason. My tonsils don't hurt but there's just a little bit of a lump when I swallow. My tongue also has a little white color, and the tongue near the throat is yellow. Every time I talk to my friends I always get a reaction, even when I cover my mouth with my hand or a cloth while talking. It seems like the smell also comes out of the nose because when I'm not talking my friend always covers his nose with his finger. I'm very depressed, I want to change the food I eat but it's hard because my family is poor and I only eat what my mother gives me (most of it is fried food, unhealthy instant food). I'm planning to go to the community health center on Thursday, but I'm confused about whether I should visit a general practitioner or dentist first? I'm so sad, I'm afraid I'll lose my friends because of this, From the sources I read they suggested I take probiotics, but even yogurt was too expensive for me. I can't smell my own breath, but I'm sure it smells terrible. services at community health centers are not very good, but it's the only one that doesn't require me to pay. I'm sure my bad breath is due to stomach acid, because it really smells if I haven't eaten it, but it still smells after eating. sinuses and tonsils could also be the reason. so should i go to the GP or dentist first?

1ib5f8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ib5f8k/for_those_of_you_who_quit_cold_turkey_how_long/,"For those of you who quit cold turkey, how long have the anxiety/depression symptoms lasted?","I am doing the no caffeine in 2025 challenge, prior to that I was drinking at least two cups per day but double espressos so 250-300mg of caffeine. I am 33 and had been drinking coffee almost daily since I was 17.

  
It's been 27 days. The first few symptoms were the usual for 48 hours, intense headaches, then for a week feeling very tired, etc. All those symptoms have slowly faded away.

  
However, every time I have tried to quit coffee, a mild anxiety/depression kicks in. There is no event in my life that would justify this now, and I have never been too prone to anxiety/depression. But since quitting coffee I am feeling blue, more anxious about the future, have more recurring negative thoughts and this general feel of dread in my diaphragm.

  
People sometimes have told me to focus on the underlying issues, but I am really convinced this is in large part because of quitting coffee, because I have tried to quit cold turkey a few times and every time it has been the same (and this is why I relapsed).

  
Anybody has experienced the same, and how much time passed until it got better?",2,1737973767.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

1ib5ekb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ib5ekb/the_happy_doomulator/,The Happy Doomulator.,"Engineer Thraxlo of the Galactic Alliance—a being with one and a half heads—leaned back in his ergonomic hover-chair and mused aloud, “What if we created a weapon capable of annihilating an entire planet while singing uplifting show tunes?”

The room, full of engineers from every corner of the Milky Way galaxy, responded with chuckles. All except for the humans. They exchanged meaningful glances over their cups of coffee, and their leader, Jeff, adjusted his glasses. “Hmm,” he said. “Uplifting show tunes? Fascinating.”

After the meeting, Jeff and his team threw themselves into the project, fueled by an overabundance of coffee and what the galactically acclaimed investigative journalist Zorpax Arblethorp would later describe as *“that uniquely human blend of ambition, lunacy, and a troubling disregard for ethical principles.”*

Nine months later, the Happy Doomulator was born.

Testing the device required a planet. A planet no one would particularly miss. The honor fell to Glormoklath, a dimly lit backwater world whose inhabitants were infamous for their distressing habit of marinating humans in garlic sauce before eating them. Jeff, whose late grandfather had been one of the Glormoklathians victims, oversaw the test personally.

Upon arrival at Glormoklath, the Doomulator was placed in orbit and activated. it scanned the planet, before unleashing a relentless stream of cheerful show tunes directly into every auditory cortex on the surface. Helmets, earplugs, and even desperate screaming proved utterly ineffective, and soon the entire planet erupted in a rousing, perfectly harmonized rendition of *Oklahoma*!—despite the fact that no one on Glormoklath had ever heard of it.

The climax was a full-orchestra rendition of *So Long, Farewell,* timed perfectly with the Doomulator unleashing a series of intense bass beats that shook the planet into implosion.

The weapon test was broadcast across all Galactic media networks, which promptly dubbed the Happy Doomulator ***“the most entertainingly horrifying weapon in recorded history,”*** while weapons enthusiasts praised it's lethal efficiency, psychological impact, and theatricality.

Not everyone was thrilled, of course. ***The Anti-Uplifting Atrocity League (AUAL)***—a band of galactic activists led by a sentient cactus named Olores, and one chronically unimpressed Tleguyian named Truq—staged a protest outside Galactic Alliance HQ. They also filed a formal complaint with the ***Independent Galactic Ethics Council.***

Humans, of course, claimed the moral high ground, arguing that the Doomulator’s victims died singing and dancing—which was more than could be said for most weapons.",27,1737973699.0,HFY,6,0.94,False

Handmade and Fixer can compete in DPS only if you are able to sneak while fighting the enemy. 

Enclave Plasma Gun with Automatic barrel is actually comparable to the (automatic) Railway Rifle DPS-wise, but the AP cost is about 3x which means that it can't compete without Canned Coffee/Sunshine Oil spam.

I do think that the AP cost shouldn't be perfectly matched to the DPS since that will probably obsolete the RR in the long term because Plasma Cartridges are far lighter than Railway spikes.",19,1737973526.0,fo76,8,0.85,False

For every narcissist or sociopath, there's like 10 other people with a fucked up brain that tell you shit that get you to doubt your reality. Doesn't even matter if they know you and doesn't matter if they know the person that hurt you.

Just imagine these people didn't exist, no abuser would be in a position of power, they simply don't have the social skills to keep any group together.
