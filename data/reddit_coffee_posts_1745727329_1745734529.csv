1k8x4fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_johnsmithmath89/comments/1k8x4fo/why_coffee_is_the_ultimate_brain_fuel_for/,Why Coffee is the Ultimate Brain Fuel for Productivity,"Coffee is more than just a beloved beverage; it's often referred to as the ultimate brain fuel, especially when it comes to boosting productivity. The relationship between coffee and productivity has been the subject of extensive research, and it‚Äôs no surprise that millions of people around the world rely on their daily cup of coffee to stay sharp, focused, and energized throughout their day.

At [**gomehedi.com**](http://gomehedi.com), we believe in offering content backed by expert opinions, scientific data, and real user experiences. In this article, we will delve into why coffee is a powerhouse when it comes to enhancing brain function and increasing productivity. Drawing on expert insights, scientific research, and real user testimonials, this guide will explain how coffee works its magic on the brain, why it‚Äôs such a powerful tool for boosting focus, and how it can keep you at your best, even during the busiest of days.

# 1. Coffee‚Äôs Active Ingredient: Caffeine

The main reason coffee is considered the ultimate brain fuel is its high caffeine content. Caffeine is a natural stimulant that impacts the central nervous system by blocking adenosine, a neurotransmitter responsible for promoting relaxation and sleepiness. By doing so, caffeine enhances the production of dopamine and norepinephrine, two neurotransmitters involved in attention, mood, and alertness. This means that after consuming coffee, you‚Äôll experience heightened focus, improved cognitive function, and an overall sense of alertness‚Äîperfect for tackling a challenging project or meeting deadline-driven tasks.

* **Scientific Research**: Studies have shown that moderate caffeine consumption can improve both short- and long-term cognitive performance. For instance, research from the *Journal of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease* found that caffeine might help improve memory retention and even delay the onset of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer‚Äôs. This cognitive boost is key to productivity, as it allows individuals to stay focused for longer periods, process information more efficiently, and improve their decision-making abilities.

# 2. Enhancing Mental Focus and Clarity

Coffee has long been linked to sharper focus and clarity, making it an indispensable tool for those who need to work through mentally demanding tasks. The stimulating effects of caffeine lead to faster and more efficient brain function. This heightened state of alertness allows you to concentrate on the task at hand without distractions.

* **User Experience**: Take Mark, a software engineer from Chicago, for instance. ‚ÄúI used to struggle with long coding sessions, feeling mentally drained by the afternoon. But after incorporating a cup of coffee into my morning routine, I noticed a significant improvement in my ability to focus and think clearly. I could work longer hours without losing mental sharpness, and I became more productive,‚Äù he shares.

# 3. Boosting Short-Term Memory and Learning Capacity

Coffee can also enhance short-term memory, making it easier to recall information and retain new knowledge. This effect is particularly beneficial for tasks that require learning or memorization, such as studying for exams, acquiring new skills, or remembering crucial details for work.

* **Expert Opinion**: Dr. Sarah R. Johnson, a neuroscientist and expert in cognitive function, explains, ‚ÄúCaffeine doesn‚Äôt just keep you awake. It actively supports the brain‚Äôs ability to retain information and process new data. For students, professionals, or anyone dealing with complex information, coffee can be a game-changer for improving short-term memory and learning capabilities.‚Äù
* **User Experience**: Sarah, a graduate student in biology, shared, ‚ÄúWhen I have a coffee before study sessions, I find that I retain information much better. The focus boost from caffeine helps me concentrate, and I can remember complex topics more easily.‚Äù

# 4. Reducing Mental Fatigue and Enhancing Alertness

One of the most well-known benefits of coffee is its ability to reduce mental fatigue. As people work for long periods, their cognitive function naturally declines due to brain fatigue. This is where coffee steps in as a powerful ally. The caffeine in coffee helps keep you energized by stimulating the production of adrenaline and reducing the perception of fatigue. As a result, coffee can be a great way to combat the afternoon slump or break through mental exhaustion during a busy workday.

* **Scientific Insight**: According to research published in *Psychopharmacology*, caffeine improves alertness and reduces feelings of tiredness. By increasing blood flow to the brain and improving cognitive functioning, it helps individuals power through even the most demanding tasks.
* **User Experience**: John, a freelance graphic designer, explains, ‚ÄúWhen I hit a creative block or start to feel mentally exhausted during long projects, a cup of coffee helps me power through. It‚Äôs like a mental reset, and I get back on track much faster.‚Äù

# 5. Promoting Long-Term Cognitive Health

While coffee‚Äôs immediate effects are well-documented, its long-term impact on brain health is equally important. Regular coffee consumption has been linked to a lower risk of developing certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer‚Äôs, thanks to the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties found in coffee beans.

* **Expert Interview**: Dr. Michael Barnes, a renowned neurologist, states, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs compelling evidence that regular coffee consumption, when consumed in moderation, can be beneficial for long-term cognitive health. The antioxidants in coffee help protect the brain from oxidative stress, while caffeine promotes neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to adapt and grow new neural connections.‚Äù
* **User Experience**: Maria, an older professional in her late 50s, shared, ‚ÄúMy mom has been drinking coffee for decades, and at 75, she‚Äôs still sharp as a tack. She‚Äôs never had memory problems, and we always joke that it‚Äôs her daily coffee habit that keeps her mind active!‚Äù

# 6. Coffee and Its Positive Impact on Mood and Motivation

In addition to increasing focus, coffee has a positive effect on mood, which in turn boosts motivation and productivity. By enhancing the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, coffee helps you feel more positive, focused, and motivated to get things done.

* **User Experience**: Tim, a startup entrepreneur, noted, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve found that my mood greatly improves after a cup of coffee. It helps me approach difficult tasks with a positive mindset and the drive to keep pushing forward. Without my coffee, I feel sluggish, but with it, I‚Äôm ready to tackle my to-do list head-on.‚Äù

I get it, it‚Äôs a business, but seeing as how our other condo property doesn‚Äôt scream capitalism as much, it‚Äôs just really disappointing. For example, grease trap cleaning in our other properties only cost about 600, here it‚Äôs 1500. Bidet installation in our other properties ranges from 300‚Äì400, here it‚Äôs 580. Almost each facility in the unit were the smallest standard size, it just speaks volumes on how the structure was more for profit over ease of use and accessibility. The floor plan of our unit is even supposedly family-friendly, but it wasn‚Äôt that at all. There was no place to put a tv that would maximize the space,the dining area has to be placed in a very awkward position in the near-middle of the unit, and the CR was designed poorly as well, with awkward spacing. We definitely regret buying a place here. Even the amenities area, the most-marketed feature of the building, wasn‚Äôt well thought-out too. The study lounge supposedly for students only had 3 tables with the standard height for working, the others were useless coffee tables.

fun of my voice by lowering their voice and repeating what I said. It genuinely sucks, and any medical help I've tried to get has brushed me off

BACKSTORY
So, I met this girl ‚ÄîLet‚Äôs call her LILY‚Äî through the peanut app (tinder for moms to meet moms) about 2 years ago after we both moved to the same larger city. Our kids are similar in age and we got along great! We text almost daily and Snapchat our days and it was a good friendship at the start. Lily was the first person, outside of my husband, that I told I was pregnant. I‚Äôve been to her kids birthday parties and we meet up occasionally for play dates, we live about 45 minutes away from each other so it‚Äôs a once a month get together. I do know Lily‚Äôs husband ‚ÄîLet‚Äôs call him ADAM‚Äî , mostly in passing but I have his phone number. He fixed my car once after it broke down and then did some extra maintenance too for free (he‚Äôs a mechanic). He‚Äôs a nice enough guy. 

Anyways moving on‚Ä¶ about a year ago Lily packed up the kids and went to a hotel while Adam was out of town visiting his mom. What happened you may ask? Lily found a BUNCH of *spicy content subscriptions* on his computer along with messages, they‚Äôd apparently discussed this being viewed as cheating, so she was ready to leave. I offered for Lily and the kids to come to my house if need be. But after a week, they talked it out and Lily went home‚Ä¶ of course under the condition that Adam would be banished to the couch (this lasted for about 2 months). Through all of this I was completely on her side. 

A few months later Lily got a new job and her new boss was GORGEOUS like my god this man is so attractive. He is married with kids and while I‚Äôve seen some flirty messages, it all seemed relatively harmless. Lily had just been ‚Äúcheated on‚Äù (not necessarily by my standards but by hers and mind you I‚Äôm on her side still) so I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. Her relationship with Adam was rocky and what‚Äôs the harm in being friendly? Well, apparently it went  deeper than some office flirtation, according to her nothing *spicy* has happened but they‚Äôve been to dinner a few times. I do view this as cheating or at least trying to. Again NOTHING has happened at this point and then Lily started telling me he was finding excuses to touch her at work (her back while he was moving past her), or bring her a coffee, or give her an extra bonus. I felt a little uncomfortable at this point but figured it‚Äôs none of my business and she‚Äôs probably reading into it because she just got ‚Äúcheated on‚Äù. I started feeling like maybe she‚Äôs not the greatest person because she nearly castrated Adam for *spicy content* while she‚Äôs carrying on with this fantasy of a MARRIED MAN WITH KIDS WHO IS ALSO HER BOSS. But not my circus - not my monkey. 

Let‚Äôs fast forward to today :) 

THE ACTUAL ISSUE
Lily hopped on a 4 hour flight today and I realized I hadn‚Äôt even asked her why she‚Äôs going to - insert big city name. Soooooo I ask what are you doing in ‚Äòbig city‚Äô?? Lily responds ‚Äú(effing) a married man. NBD‚Äù I follow up with a ‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù 

She proceeded to send a couple minute long voice note saying she‚Äôs drunk and that why she can tell me ha ha what a terrible wife she is ha ha.

Lily has been seeing this MARRIED MAN WITH CHILDREN - Let‚Äôs just call him casino guy - for over 2 years. Lily met casino guy years ago at, you guessed it, the casino. She went back to his room for a ‚Äúone night stand‚Äù because ‚Äúhe had a Rolex‚Äù. Apparently, this has continued every few months since that first night. Casino guy, who again is MARRIED WITH CHILDREN, pays for her flights and hotels and they meet up. They spend a few nights of their ‚Äúbusiness trips‚Äù going on dates and doing *spicy* things. 

I immediately showed my husband the messages, and then told him - I think I should tell Adam. {We are very low drama people and tend to avoid drama at all costs, usually it‚Äôs just our families but continuing} My husband responds ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be messy‚Äù. Sir.. me? I‚Äôm not the messy one. He tells me I don‚Äôt need that drama, just cut her off and why would I start something I don‚Äôt want to be a part of. 

He‚Äôs right - I don‚Äôt want the drama. But my conscience is telling me to let Adam know. I would want to know. But we aren‚Äôt exactly close. 



So Reddit and Charlotte and friends, would I be the a-hole if I text Adam, against my husbands advisement, and tell him Lily has been cheating on him for years? 

Obviously this would mean losing a friend but I don‚Äôt think this is a friendship I need anymore.

I just recently turned 15 and there hasn't been any very recent big change in my life. The past few years (and especially last/this year) have been pretty rough, so it's possible this could be related to depression, but I really doubt I'm suddenly so stressed. I was also diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia 2 years ago, and while I took iron pills to get rid of it or something, I'm supposed to get another CDC soon because I'm showing sudden symptoms.

  
My issue is that I sleep so much now and I would like to not get yelled at for it. It's literally fucking up days of my life. Admittedly, I don't have a great or consistent sleep schedule, but this is also probably the best I've been treating my sleep since I've ever lived. I barely pull all nighters, I sometimes go to bed at around 2-3, usually before then, and I don't stock up/consistently drink a lot of energy drinks and coffee. This is serious improvement for me. It's really hard for me to feel like doing things during the day, so I get insane bouts of revenge bedtime procrastination. I really need to fix this, but I don't really know how/how to be consistent with that too. 

  
But also, recently I've started taking naps after school. I wake up roughly around 5:30-6:30 for school, come back home around 4:00-5:00, and sometimes end up sleeping in either car ride. Then, sometimes I'll plop down on my bed and immediately conk out. I don't usually feel consciously tired which is what makes this so frustrating. Two times, this happened and I literally woke up the next day. Usually this happens and it's annoying only because I hate naps, and I'll wake up close to dinnertime, but this occurrence has quite literally wasted my day away. If I don't nap, which is quite normal, I end up sleeping an abnormally long time (for me). I used to be able to consistently wake up when my alarm did, which used to be 4am. Now, even going to bed around/on my bed time (10-10:30), I can't wake up when my alarm turns on, or when my dad wakes me up. On the weekends I usually sleep late and wake up at a fairly regular time, almost always before 11am, but somedays like yesterday I will go to bed at a decent hour and wake up around 13-14 hours later. I'm basically never well rested these days, and I keep getting yelled at for my incompetence. I need ways to discipline myself, because regardless of hemoglobin level, my sleeping habits have never been great. Suggestions?",1,1745732695.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

Ever sat down to work, with all the motivation in the world, only to find your mind wandering to a million different places? Same here. üòÖ **I‚Äôve tried everything under the sun to focus better‚Äîcountless cups of coffee ‚òï, Pomodoro timers, even some questionable energy drinks‚Äîbut none seemed to hit the mark.** Until now.

Meet my new obsession: **cyclic sighing.** Sounds weird, right? But trust me, it‚Äôs a game-changer. Over the past 7 days, I decided to give this breathing technique a whirl to see if it could actually help me focus. Spoiler alert: things got interesting!

**So, what exactly is cyclic sighing?**

It's a fancy name for a ridiculously simple breathing exercise. Here's how it works:
  
- **Step 1:** Inhale through your nose for about 3-4 seconds.
- **Step 2:** Take another small inhale (a little top-off, if you will).
- **Step 3:** Exhale slowly and fully through your mouth for 6-8 seconds.

Repeat this for about 5 minutes, ideally when you feel your concentration slipping away. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And here‚Äôs where things get wild. After doing this daily, here‚Äôs what I noticed:

- **Increased Focus:** By day three, my mind chatter was like that annoying friend who finally takes a hint. Ah, sweet silence! 
- **Chill Vibes Only:** My stress levels dipped a notch. Who knew my nervous system just needed a bit of TLC? 
- **Energy Boost:** This was the most surprising! No 3 PM slumps or reaching for the fourth cup of coffee. My brain actually felt... refreshed?

Sounds too good to be true? I thought so too until I tried it. And there‚Äôs some science backing this up‚Äîthis method apparently helps regulate the nervous system by balancing oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, which calms us down and sharpens focus. **How cool is that**? üß†üîß

Want to give it a go? Here‚Äôs a little challenge: try it for a week and notice any changes. Maybe you'll find a new level in your productivity game. ü§ì

Remember, it's all about experimenting and finding what works for you. At the end of the day, who wouldn‚Äôt want a little extra chill and focus? üöÄ

1k8wjuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1k8wjuh/found_the_key_to_happiness/,Found the key to happiness,"I've spent too long searching, moving between countries, experiencing different places and people and things, self-improving, self-evaluating, hoping to find happiness. But I'm now confident that the below is the complete recipe to happiness that I've found, and that's been there all along at the same time. I just needed to look into all the other possible branches to know there's nothing more at the end, to really realize that this is it, and share it with confidence. I know that for as long as I live following those guidelines, I'll be able to say I'm getting the best there is out of life, and die with no regrets knowing I made it count as a happy one.

I learned that to be happy, you have to first learn to be content. It's difficult as it requires going a bit against the grain (of unhappy people, mind you!), as our current modern culture teaches us to always want more, to always rush behind chasing something, and never just stop and be happy with what you have. But that's exactly what you need to learn to do to find *real* happiness.

At some point that's likely coming or has come overdue for most reading this, you have to come to a point where you decide to change something fundamental about your success criteria for your life. That is to realize that after 20ish or 30ish of long and exploratory years on this planet, you have an idea of what you like, and what you don't like, what tends to be within your actual reality, and know that you have enough, and the people in your life are enough, and the title in your work e-mail signature is enough, and you are enough. You don't need more. If more happens, great, but you don't need to chase it anymore. You don't always need to try new things or do new things or succeed better before *something* magically comes and makes you happy. Because it never will. It's not the right path to seek it. Because happiness is something within you all along, that comes out when you aren't too distracted to allow it to come out.

Tally up the things you now know you enjoy, and allow yourself to fully feel the enjoyment of how they make you feel. Think how your favorite smell, taste, sight, emotion, hobby, person, pet or whatnot make you feel, and allow yourself to just focus on feeling it, with no guilt or distractions, and letting go of anything telling you that they are not enough. If you like the way it feels, it's enough just the way it is. Create opportunities to feel those things. Go for a walk next to the garden that smells good to get your favorite coffee or tea that you enjoy the smell or taste of.
Spend time with your favorite person and talk about the memories that you cherish, watch a sunset or eat your favorite dish. Do whatever creates the feelings that make you smile. As they happen, just allow yourself to fully take that in as is. No pressure, just focus on the moment as it happens. That's literally it, it doesn't get better than that. This is what life's joys are about. 

Ironically, many people subconsciously know this, when they go on vacations. Maybe two weeks per year, when they take their (flawed like everyone, but favorite) person, to just enjoy their favorite things as is, without chasing anything, just slowly enjoying them as they are. But they put this unfortunate arbitrary time box on that, allowing it to happen only during those two weeks, and the moment they come back, they forget about this way of thinking/feeling/experiencing life, and immediately drop them entirely in daily life. 

Critically, you may have found that people chasing something the most, seem to be the most disturbed, discontent, and unhappy. This is because it's critical to stop trying to bend reality into something that does not exist (aka your imagination of how things should perfectly be). It's a lot of effort to try to bend something that will only ever snap back to status quo with the power of nothing but disappointment proportional to the difference between what exists, and what you imagined you're owed. Once you realize you are not owed anything beyond what is, there is no more disappointment. You save yourself from a futile and a pointless loss of time you could have spent cherishing something that already just is, and could have been making you happy all this time instead. Your pushback against this idea is the exact same force that's keeping you unhappy.

Undermining, not consciously noticing, or not enjoying your sources of joy as they happen are the easiest ways to kill your happiness, depriving yourself of joyous moments. On the flipside, it's in your power to start doing the opposite. Find opportunities to cherish and enjoy things, people, experiences you've learned that you like by now just as is, learn to be content with them, while letting go of any anxiety that you or they need to be anywhere else, and you'll feel happiness come into your life.",4,1745731529.0,selfimprovement,2,1.0,False

# My Journey Before MITOLYN

Before MITOLYN came into my life, things weren‚Äôt great. I‚Äôm a 41-year-old parent juggling work, family, and all the daily chaos that comes with it. For as long as I can remember, I was always tired‚Äîeven after a full night‚Äôs sleep. My mind felt foggy, and I‚Äôd lose track of what I was saying mid-sentence. By the time afternoon rolled around, I felt like I was dragging myself through the rest of the day. I tried everything you can think of: drinking tons of coffee, expensive superfood powders, yoga, meditation apps, and even some trendy diets. But nothing seemed to stick, and I still ended up feeling worn out and disappointed.

It was one of those nights when I couldn‚Äôt sleep (again!) that I stumbled onto MITOLYN. I read stories from regular people who felt just like I did‚Äîand who were saying they finally had their spark back. That was all I needed to try it myself.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

MITOLYN is a supplement, but it‚Äôs not like the multivitamins you see at the grocery store. It‚Äôs all about helping the mitochondria in your cells. If you‚Äôre not a science buff, mitochondria are like the battery packs inside each cell‚Äîthey make the energy that keeps you moving, thinking, and feeling alive. When your mitochondria aren‚Äôt working well, you end up feeling tired, slow, and even sad.

What‚Äôs cool is that MITOLYN is made with special ingredients that work together to make those little batteries stronger and healthier. Some of the main things inside are CoQ10, PQQ, and something called NAD+ boosters. There are also natural herbs like rhodiola and ginseng. All of these are meant to help your body make more energy, handle stress better, and even help your brain focus.

I liked that MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt just cover up tiredness with a burst of caffeine‚Äîit actually works on the source of the problem.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

I promised myself I‚Äôd give MITOLYN a fair shot and write down how I felt each week. Here‚Äôs how it went for me:

**Week 1:**  
I started with just one capsule a day, a little nervous but hopeful. I was shocked when I woke up a few days later before my alarm and didn‚Äôt feel like a zombie. That was new!

**Week 2:**  
No more afternoon slump! My brain felt less foggy, and I could actually finish my work on time. My family noticed I was in a better mood and joked that I was ‚Äúless grumpy.‚Äù

**Week 4:**  
Sleep was deeper, and for the first time in years, I remembered my dreams. I started going for short walks again because I had energy left after work. My anxiety felt lower‚Äîlike I could handle stress without getting overwhelmed.

**Months 2-6:**  
Things just kept getting better. I lost some weight (about 14 pounds!), and my skin looked healthier. My doctor said my blood pressure was better too. Friends asked if I‚Äôd found a new diet or workout, but all I changed was taking MITOLYN every day.

**Months 7-12:**  
By now, MITOLYN was just part of my routine. My energy levels were steady all day long. I didn‚Äôt need coffee to get going in the morning. I even started tackling big projects at work and didn‚Äôt feel burned out at the end of the day. I felt like myself again, but better.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

Here‚Äôs the easy version: MITOLYN helps your cells make more energy. When your cells have more power, you feel more awake, think clearer, and your body works better. The main ingredients each have a job:

- **CoQ10:** Think of it as fuel for your body‚Äôs energy-making machines.
- **PQQ:** This one helps you build new ‚Äúbatteries‚Äù so you get even more power.
- **NAD+ Boosters:** These slow down the aging process and help your body fix itself.
- **Rhodiola and Ginseng:** Super helpful for handling stress, staying focused, and not getting that jittery feeling you get from coffee.

The magic comes from how all these parts work together. MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just a quick fix‚Äîit‚Äôs like giving your whole body a tune-up.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

I think MITOLYN is perfect for anyone who:

- Wakes up tired no matter how long they sleep
- Struggles to focus or always feels distracted
- Wants to lose a bit of weight or just feel lighter
- Feels older than they really are
- Needs a boost without the crash from sugar or caffeine

I‚Äôve told my friends, my family, and even my neighbor who always says nothing works for him. Honestly, if you just want to feel like the best version of yourself again, MITOLYN is worth a try.

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

**Pros:**

- Felt better within the first week
- All natural and safe for daily use
- No weird side effects (for me)
- Steady, all-day energy and focus
- Company is clear about what‚Äôs in it

**Cons:**

- It costs more than regular vitamins (but for me, it‚Äôs worth it)
- Only available online (but it ships fast)
- You have to take it every day to keep feeling the benefits (set a reminder!)

# Final Verdict: Is MITOLYN Worth It?

After taking MITOLYN for a whole year, I can honestly say it changed my life for the better. I have the kind of energy I haven‚Äôt felt since I was much younger. I‚Äôm more present with my family, sharper at work, and I finally feel hopeful about my health again. It‚Äôs not magic, but it‚Äôs the closest thing I‚Äôve found to a real, lasting change.

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling tired, or just want to get back to feeling like YOU again, I say don‚Äôt wait. MITOLYN might be what you‚Äôve been looking for. For me, it‚Äôs absolutely worth it‚Äîand I hope it helps you too!",1,1745731419.0,Programming_Interview,0,1.0,False

Still, I decided to see if MITOLYN was just hype or if it could actually help someone like me. So, I bought a year‚Äôs supply, and here‚Äôs how MITOLYN changed my life, step by step.

### [‚úÖ Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://4bdf3kthv1v33p4jsfs7cf3n5c.hop.clickbank.net)

# My Journey Before MITOLYN

Let me start at the beginning. I‚Äôm a regular person, not a scientist or a paid spokesperson. I‚Äôm 41 years old, a parent, and I run a small business. For years, my days felt like an uphill battle. I was always tired, no matter how early I went to bed. By the afternoon, my brain was foggy and my motivation was gone. I tried drinking more coffee, taking all sorts of vitamins, and even jumping on trendy diets. Sometimes, I felt a tiny bit better, but nothing really made a difference.

My weight slowly crept up, my mood was all over the place, and I just didn‚Äôt feel like myself. I honestly thought maybe this was just what getting older felt like. But deep down, I didn‚Äôt want to give up. That‚Äôs when I started searching for something new‚Äîand that‚Äôs how I found MITOLYN.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

If you look on the label, MITOLYN is called a ‚Äúmitochondrial support supplement.‚Äù But what does that actually mean? Well, every cell in your body has these little engines inside called mitochondria. They‚Äôre responsible for turning the food you eat into energy. If your mitochondria slow down, so do you. That can mean tiredness, brain fog, stubborn weight, and feeling older than you are.

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just a mix of random vitamins. It‚Äôs carefully designed to help your cells‚Äô powerhouses work better. It contains things like CoQ10 (which helps your cells make energy), PQQ (which encourages your body to make more mitochondria), NAD+ boosters (which are linked to aging and repair), and adaptogenic herbs like Rhodiola and Ginseng that help you handle stress and stay focused.

What impressed me was how MITOLYN goes after the root problem‚Äîsluggish mitochondria‚Äîinstead of just masking the symptoms. It‚Äôs like fixing the engine, not just polishing the hood.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

I wanted to be careful, so I started slow‚Äîjust one capsule a day.

**Week 1:**  
After a few days, I noticed I woke up before my alarm and didn‚Äôt feel groggy. That was a small but exciting change for me. I didn‚Äôt need two cups of coffee to get started.

**Week 2:**  
By the second week, my afternoon crash disappeared. I was actually finishing my tasks at work and still had some energy left for my family at night. My brain felt less ‚Äúcloudy.‚Äù I was able to pay attention and remember things better.

**Week 4:**  
A month in, I realized I wasn‚Äôt tossing and turning at night anymore. I woke up feeling rested. I even started going for walks after dinner, something I hadn‚Äôt done in ages because I was always too tired. My mood was steadier, and I didn‚Äôt snap at little things as much.

**Month 2 to 6:**  
As the months went by, I kept getting little wins. I lost about 10 pounds without changing much else. My skin looked clearer, and my friends started noticing I seemed happier. My doctor even mentioned my blood pressure was better at my checkup.

**Month 12:**  
Now, after a full year, I can honestly say I feel better than I have in a decade. My energy lasts all day. My mind feels sharp. I‚Äôm not perfect‚ÄîI still get tired sometimes‚Äîbut I know I‚Äôm in control of my health. I feel younger, lighter, and proud of how far I‚Äôve come.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

MITOLYN works because it helps your body make clean, steady energy‚Äîright at the source. When your mitochondria are healthy, every part of you works better: your brain, your muscles, even your mood.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs in MITOLYN that made the biggest difference for me:

- **CoQ10:** This helps your cells turn food into energy. Without it, you feel tired.
- **PQQ:** This rare compound helps your body build new mitochondria, which is like adding more engines to your system.
- **NAD+ Boosters:** These support your cells as they repair themselves and slow down aging.
- **Rhodiola & Ginseng:** These herbs help you deal with stress and keep you focused, without making you jittery.

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt magic, but the combination of these ingredients makes your whole system run smoother. Instead of covering up tiredness with caffeine or sugar, it helps your body make its own energy, the healthy way.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

If you‚Äôre reading this and thinking, ‚ÄúI feel tired all the time,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt focus,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I lose this weight?‚Äù‚Äîthen MITOLYN might be for you. It helped me, and I think it could help people who:

- Never feel fully rested, even after a good night‚Äôs sleep
- Struggle with brain fog or forgetfulness
- Have stubborn weight that won‚Äôt budge
- Feel older than they should
- Want to feel more alive, every single day

I‚Äôve already told my family, friends, and even my neighbors about MITOLYN. My brother, who was always skeptical about supplements, tried it and now he‚Äôs hooked too.

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

**Pros:**
- I felt real results in just a week
- All-natural, non-GMO ingredients
- No weird side effects for me
- My mood, energy, and focus all got better
- The company is upfront about what‚Äôs in it and how it works

**Cons:**
- It costs more than most regular supplements, but I think it‚Äôs worth it for the results
- You can only order it online (but shipping was quick)
- You have to remember to take it every day for the best results (I set a phone reminder!)

# What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a dietary supplement that claims to help you lose weight, feel more energetic, and improve your overall health. It‚Äôs made with natural ingredients (which is something I always look for), and it comes in a neat little bottle that actually looks pretty fancy on my kitchen counter. According to the label and the website, MITOLYN is supposed to make it easier to manage your weight, clear up your thinking, and even help your body work better by boosting your metabolism. 

The idea is that by taking MITOLYN regularly, you‚Äôll start feeling better from the inside out. I was especially interested in the fact that it‚Äôs all-natural‚Äîno weird chemicals, just plant-based ingredients that are supposed to work together to make you healthier. 

# Why I Decided to Try MITOLYN

Honestly, I‚Äôve tried a lot of different supplements over the years. Some made a small difference, but nothing that really stuck or made me feel truly different. I was getting tired of feeling tired, if that makes sense! When I read about MITOLYN, what caught my eye was how many people were saying it helped them with more than just weight loss. People talked about having more energy, feeling happier, and being able to focus better at work or school.

I wanted something to help me get back on track‚Äîsomething gentle, that would help me feel like myself again. So, after thinking about it for a while and reading everything I could find, I decided to give MITOLYN a real chance. 

# My 30-Day Experience with MITOLYN

I promised myself I‚Äôd stick with MITOLYN for a full month and keep a journal of how I felt. Here‚Äôs how each week went for me:

# Week 1: The Initial Impact

The first week was honestly better than I expected. I started every morning with one MITOLYN capsule and a big glass of water. After just a couple of days, I noticed I wasn‚Äôt as groggy in the mornings. Normally, I‚Äôm slow to wake up and need a lot of coffee, but I felt more awake and ready to start my day.

My stomach felt more settled, too. Usually, I have some bloating after breakfast, but that didn‚Äôt happen as much. I wasn‚Äôt expecting any big changes yet, but these little things made me hopeful.

# Week 2: Seeing the First Signs of Change

By the second week, things were picking up. My energy stayed steady throughout the day‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt have that big afternoon crash where I just want to nap at my desk. I started going for short walks every evening, and I actually wanted to move more, which isn‚Äôt always the case for me.

Another thing I noticed was my cravings were less intense. I usually reach for chips or cookies when I‚Äôm bored, but suddenly I just didn‚Äôt feel the urge as much. I felt fuller after meals, which made it easier to eat healthy.

# Week 3: Feeling More Confident

Week three was when I started to see real results. My pants felt a bit looser, and when I looked in the mirror, I could see I was slimming down. I felt proud of myself for sticking with it and actually seeing changes.

My mind felt clearer, too. I had an easier time getting through work and chores without getting distracted. Even my family noticed that I seemed more upbeat and energetic. I didn‚Äôt need to rely on extra snacks or caffeine to get by, which was a nice bonus.

# Week 4: The Final Transformation

The last week was, honestly, pretty amazing. By this point, I‚Äôd lost a few pounds, my skin looked brighter, and I just felt good. I woke up excited to start my day, and my mood was so much better than before.

I also noticed I was sleeping better at night. Normally, I toss and turn, but now I was falling asleep faster and waking up rested. My brain felt sharper, and I could handle busy days without feeling overwhelmed.

# The Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

Here are some of the main things I experienced during my month with MITOLYN:

- **Steady Energy:** I felt energetic from morning to evening, without feeling jittery or anxious. No more afternoon crashes!
- **Better Metabolism:** My digestion improved and I didn‚Äôt feel bloated as often. I lost some weight, which made me feel more confident.
- **Sharper Focus:** My thoughts were clearer, and I could get more done in less time.
- **Reduced Cravings:** I wasn‚Äôt snacking as much, and I found it easier to make healthy choices.
- **Happier Mood:** I just felt lighter and happier, like a cloud had lifted.
- **Better Sleep:** Falling asleep was easier, and I woke up ready for the day.

# Why MITOLYN Might Be the Right Supplement for You

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling sluggish or frustrated with your weight, MITOLYN could be worth a try. I loved that it‚Äôs made with natural ingredients and didn‚Äôt make me feel weird or uncomfortable. It helped me feel better both physically and mentally, and it was easy to fit into my routine.

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt a magic fix‚Äîyou still need to eat well and move your body‚Äîbut it gave me the boost I needed to get started. If you want a gentle, supportive supplement that helps with energy, focus, and weight management, MITOLYN might work for you too.

# Final Thoughts

# My Journey Before MITOLYN

I‚Äôm 38 years old, juggling a busy life with two kids, a demanding job, and a house that never seems to stay clean. For as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve felt worn out. My mornings started with grogginess, my afternoons were a blur of yawns and caffeine, and by evening, I was too tired to even think about exercise or hobbies. I felt stuck in a loop: tired, foggy, and unmotivated.

I tried everything I could think of: drinking more coffee (which made me jittery), ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù teas, expensive smoothie powders, and even meditation apps. None of it made much of a difference, and most days, I was just trying to get by.

One night, while scrolling on my phone, I came across stories of people who said MITOLYN had helped them feel alive again. I was suspicious at first, but I was also desperate‚Äîso I decided to try it myself.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

MITOLYN sounds fancy, but it‚Äôs actually simple: it‚Äôs a supplement that‚Äôs supposed to help your body‚Äôs mitochondria work better. If you remember from science class, mitochondria are like tiny batteries inside your cells. They make the energy that lets you move, think, and feel good.

When your mitochondria aren‚Äôt working right, your whole body feels the difference. You get tired easily, your brain gets foggy, and things like losing weight or sleeping well get a lot harder.

MITOLYN is made with ingredients that are known to support these ‚Äúenergy batteries.‚Äù Some of these include stuff you might have heard of (like CoQ10) and others that are more special, like PQQ and NAD+ boosters. It‚Äôs a blend designed to give your mitochondria the tools they need to make more energy, repair themselves, and help you feel your best.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

I want to give you a real look at what happened for me, so here‚Äôs how my experience went, week by week and month by month:

**Week 1:**  
I started off with one capsule in the morning with breakfast. By the third day, I noticed something small but surprising: I didn‚Äôt need a second cup of coffee to get going. My mind felt a little sharper, and I wasn‚Äôt dragging myself through the day.

**Week 2:**  
My afternoon slump started to fade. I was still tired by bedtime, but it was a normal tired, not the ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt keep my eyes open‚Äù tired. My mood was a bit lighter, and I found myself laughing more with my kids.

**Week 4:**  
I started waking up before my alarm, feeling like I‚Äôd actually slept. I was more focused at work, and chores didn‚Äôt feel impossible anymore. I even started walking after dinner, something I hadn‚Äôt done in months.

**Month 2:**  
My energy was steadier all day. I didn‚Äôt have any side effects or tummy troubles. I felt more motivated to eat healthy, and my cravings for junk food dropped off. My friends commented that my skin looked brighter.

**Month 3‚Äì6:**  
The changes became even clearer. I lost about 10 pounds just by moving more and making better food choices‚Äîno strict dieting. My sleep got deeper, and I remembered my dreams. I felt less stressed and more present with my family.

**Month 7‚Äì12:**  
I stuck with MITOLYN every day. I didn‚Äôt get sick once during the winter, which is rare for me. My doctor even said my bloodwork looked better than last year. I started jogging on weekends with my kids, and my mood stayed positive even on tough days.

Now, after a full year, I feel like a different person‚Äîhappier, healthier, and in control.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

So, why does MITOLYN help? Here‚Äôs how I understand it, without any confusing science words.

Think of your body like a city, and your mitochondria are the power plants. If those power plants get old or run down, the whole city slows down‚Äîlights dim, machines stop, and everything feels sluggish. MITOLYN gives the power plants what they need to run better and even build new ones.

Some of the main helpers in MITOLYN are:

- **CoQ10:** Think of this like oil for your engine. It keeps everything running smoothly and helps make energy.
- **PQQ:** This helps your body grow more power plants (mitochondria), so you have more energy overall.
- **NAD+ Boosters:** These are like repair crews. They fix any broken parts and keep your cells young.
- **Rhodiola and Ginseng:** These are natural ‚Äústress shields‚Äù that help you stay focused and calm, even on busy days.

All the ingredients work together, and that‚Äôs why MITOLYN feels different from just taking a vitamin or drinking an energy drink.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

I think MITOLYN could help a lot of people, but especially if you:

- Wake up tired, no matter how long you sleep
- Can‚Äôt focus or feel foggy
- Struggle with stubborn weight
- Get moody or stressed easily
- Want to feel younger and more active

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre 25 or 65. I‚Äôve recommended MITOLYN to my parents, my best friend, and even my neighbor who‚Äôs into fitness. Everyone‚Äôs body is different, but if you feel stuck or low-energy, MITOLYN is worth a try.

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîno product is perfect. Here are the pros and cons I found after using MITOLYN for a year:

**Pros:**

- I felt the difference in just a few days
- My energy and focus improved, and my mood was brighter
- Ingredients are natural, and I didn‚Äôt have any side effects
- My sleep, weight, and skin all got better
- The company is open about what‚Äôs inside and how it works

**Cons:**

- It‚Äôs more expensive than some basic supplements
- You can only buy it online, which might not work for everyone
- You need to take it every day (I set a reminder on my phone)

Overall, the good stuff far outweighed the small downsides for me.

# Final Verdict: Is MITOLYN Worth It?

After one full year, my answer is a big YES‚ÄîMITOLYN is absolutely worth it for me. I have more energy for my family, my job, and even for myself. I‚Äôm not perfect, but I finally feel like I‚Äôm living, not just getting by.

# The Slow Burn of Fatigue and Hopelessness

Imagine waking up every morning already tired. That was me. I wasn‚Äôt really sick, but I wasn‚Äôt healthy, either. It felt like my body was a car running out of fuel‚ÄîI could barely get through the day, and doing simple things like laundry or even making breakfast felt impossible. My brain was always foggy, my muscles ached, and I just felt‚Ä¶ heavy. I went to the doctor a few times, but all my tests came back ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù They said I was fine, but I knew deep down something was off.

I started worrying that maybe this was just how life was supposed to be as an adult. But I couldn‚Äôt accept that. I missed the old me‚Äîthe one who laughed easily, finished projects, and enjoyed spending time with friends. There had to be a solution. That‚Äôs when I stumbled across MITOLYN.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a supplement made to help your body‚Äôs mitochondria work better. Mitochondria are like tiny batteries inside your cells. They give you the energy to do everything‚Äîwalk, think, play, even sleep well. As we get older, these batteries don‚Äôt work as well as they used to, so we feel tired, slow, and sometimes even sad.

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just a normal vitamin. It‚Äôs a formula designed to ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù these little batteries, so your body and brain get the power they need. It uses ingredients that scientists have studied for years, and everything in the bottle is there to help your cells work at their best.

# Why I Took the Leap

I was scared to try MITOLYN at first. I‚Äôd wasted money before on ‚Äúmiracle cures‚Äù that made big promises but did nothing. But something about MITOLYN seemed different. People said it didn‚Äôt make them jittery or anxious, and that the energy felt natural and long-lasting. I read that the ingredients‚Äîlike PQQ, CoQ10, and NAD+ boosters‚Äîwere real things doctors talk about, not just made-up words.

So, after a lot of thinking (and reading every review I could find!), I decided to give MITOLYN a try. I figured, what do I have to lose? I ordered a month‚Äôs supply and hoped for the best.

# Week 1: Subtle But Promising

The first few days, I didn‚Äôt expect much. But by day three, I noticed I wasn‚Äôt dragging myself out of bed anymore. I felt a little lighter, like someone had taken a heavy backpack off my shoulders. I didn‚Äôt need my usual second (or third) cup of coffee in the afternoon, and I wasn‚Äôt snapping at people around me. It wasn‚Äôt a huge change, but it was enough to give me hope.

# Week 2: Clarity, Focus, Drive

By the second week, something really special started happening. My mind felt clearer. I stopped forgetting little things, and tasks that used to feel impossible were suddenly easy to finish. I actually started enjoying work again, and even spent time on hobbies I‚Äôd forgotten about. My friends even noticed I was in a better mood. One even said, ‚ÄúYou seem happier lately‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your secret?‚Äù That made me smile.

# Week 3: Energy Like I Had in My 20s

Here‚Äôs where things really got awesome. I started waking up before my alarm, ready to get moving. I went for walks, cleaned the house, and started cooking healthy meals. My muscles didn‚Äôt ache as much, and I felt strong again. The energy I had wasn‚Äôt wild or fake‚Äîit felt like my body had finally remembered how to be alive. I felt like the best version of myself from years ago.

# Week 4: Deep Sleep and Radiant Health

Before MITOLYN, I tossed and turned every night. Now, I fall asleep quickly and wake up feeling actually rested. My skin looks brighter, and even my stomach feels happier (less bloating and tummy aches). My mood is much more steady, and I don‚Äôt feel as stressed out. It‚Äôs like my whole body is working together, instead of fighting itself all the time.

# The Ingredients That Make It Work

MITOLYN uses a bunch of science-backed ingredients that help your cells:

- **PQQ**: Helps your mitochondria grow and work better.
- **CoQ10**: Gives your cells the power to make energy.
- **NAD+ Precursors**: Support your body‚Äôs natural repair and anti-aging processes.
- **L-Carnitine & ALCAR**: Help your brain work better and turn fat into energy.
- **B-Vitamins & Magnesium**: Keep your nerves, heart, and metabolism strong.

There are no weird chemicals, no fake sugars, and no stuff you can‚Äôt pronounce. Just real, quality ingredients your body actually knows how to use.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

If you:
- Feel tired, even after sleeping a lot
- Struggle with brain fog or forget things easily
- Wake up groggy or sore
- Feel older than your real age
- Want more energy, focus, and joy in your day

Then you should think about giving MITOLYN a try. It worked for me in ways I didn‚Äôt expect, and it could work for you too.

# Final Verdict: Don't Wait Like I Did

Looking back, I wish I hadn‚Äôt waited so long to try something new. I wasted too many months feeling stuck, thinking that low energy was just ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for adults. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. MITOLYN helped me get my spark back, and I honestly feel excited about life again.

If you‚Äôre reading this and thinking, ‚Äúshould I try it?‚Äù‚Äîthis is your sign. Don‚Äôt wait until you hit rock bottom. Give yourself a chance to feel better, sooner.

# The Struggle Before MITOLYN

Before I ever heard of MITOLYN, my days felt like a never-ending cycle of tiredness. No matter how many hours I slept, I‚Äôd wake up feeling groggy. I was always reaching for another cup of coffee, especially in the afternoons when I would hit a wall of tiredness. I was irritable, often snapping at my family for small things, and my motivation to do anything fun or productive was almost gone.

Getting sick became almost normal for me. If there was a cold or flu going around, I‚Äôd catch it. And when I got sick, it took forever to bounce back. I felt like my body was running out of battery, and no matter what I tried, I couldn‚Äôt recharge. Vitamins, green smoothies, fancy workouts‚Äînothing really made a dent in my fatigue.

Then, one day, after yet another restless night and a particularly rough morning, I decided to search for something new. That‚Äôs when I came across MITOLYN and decided to give it a try. I was skeptical, but at that point, I was willing to try anything.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a health supplement designed to help your body‚Äôs energy factories‚Äîthe mitochondria‚Äîwork at their best. If you haven‚Äôt heard of mitochondria, they‚Äôre tiny parts inside every cell that turn the food we eat into the energy our bodies need to move, think, and heal. When they‚Äôre not working right, you feel tired, slow, and even sad.

What I liked about MITOLYN was that it wasn‚Äôt just another quick fix or caffeine pill. It‚Äôs made with ingredients that researchers say actually support the health of mitochondria. That means it helps your body make real, natural energy, not just fake energy that disappears after an hour.

It‚Äôs packed with things like antioxidants (which help protect your cells), vitamins that help your body‚Äôs systems run smoothly, and nutrients that make the immune system stronger. It‚Äôs like giving your body all the tools it needs to fix itself from the inside out.

# The Life-Changing Impact of MITOLYN

The first time I took MITOLYN, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. I‚Äôd been disappointed by so many other things before. But by the end of the first day, I noticed I didn‚Äôt need my usual afternoon nap. I wasn‚Äôt bouncing off the walls, but my energy felt steady‚Äîlike I could keep going without dragging my feet.

It wasn‚Äôt just about energy. I started feeling more positive, less irritable, and even excited to do things I‚Äôd been putting off for months. It was like a fog was slowly lifting, and I was finally seeing the world clearly again.

# Week 1: A Noticeable Shift

By the end of my first week with MITOLYN, I was honestly surprised. I woke up before my alarm, and instead of groaning and hitting snooze, I felt ready to get out of bed. The mornings were easier, and my head felt clearer. My usual brain fog‚Äîthe one that made it hard to remember things or focus on my work‚Äîstarted to fade away.

I also noticed that I didn‚Äôt have those crazy energy crashes in the afternoon. I could get through my work and even had energy left for a walk or to play with my kids in the evening. My mood was better, too‚ÄîI found myself laughing more and feeling less stressed about little things.

# Week 3: Immune Support & Enhanced Recovery

Three weeks in, the changes were even more noticeable. Normally, by this time of year, I‚Äôd have caught at least one cold, but I was feeling stronger than ever. I wasn‚Äôt sneezing or coughing, and I bounced back quickly after tough days at work or a hard workout. My muscles didn‚Äôt ache for days, and I didn‚Äôt feel wiped out after exercise.

Even when everyone around me seemed to be getting sick, I stayed healthy. My skin looked brighter, and I felt more alive. It‚Äôs like my body was finally getting the support it needed to repair and protect itself.

# The Science Behind MITOLYN

So, how does MITOLYN actually work? The magic is in how it helps your mitochondria. Think of mitochondria as tiny batteries inside your cells. When they‚Äôre full and working well, you feel energetic and healthy. If they‚Äôre drained, you feel sluggish and tired.

MITOLYN includes ingredients like Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which helps mitochondria produce energy more efficiently. There‚Äôs also Alpha-lipoic acid, known for helping your body use energy better and fight off harmful stuff called free radicals. Plus, it has B vitamins, magnesium, and other nutrients that keep your body‚Äôs systems running smoothly.

Together, these ingredients don‚Äôt just give you energy‚Äîthey also help your brain, your muscles, your immune system, and even your mood. It‚Äôs a complete approach, so you feel better in every way, not just less tired.

# Why MITOLYN Is Different From Other Supplements

I‚Äôve tried plenty of supplements before‚Äîsome promised more energy, others better sleep, and some claimed to help my immune system. But most of them only focused on one thing, and the results never lasted. Many were just loaded with caffeine or sugar, which made me feel jittery for an hour before crashing even harder.

MITOLYN feels different because it works with your body, not against it. Instead of masking the problem, it helps fix the root cause‚Äîunhealthy mitochondria‚Äîso you get real, lasting results. It doesn‚Äôt give you a quick buzz, but instead helps you build up your natural energy over time.

What I also appreciate is that MITOLYN uses clean, high-quality ingredients. There are no weird chemicals or scary side effects. It‚Äôs gentle on my stomach and easy to take every day.

# The Results Speak for Themselves

Now, several months in, I‚Äôm amazed at how much my life has changed. I‚Äôm not just less tired; I‚Äôm more engaged in everything I do. My work has improved, and my boss even noticed that I‚Äôm more focused and creative. I‚Äôm spending more quality time with my family, enjoying hobbies, and saying yes to activities I used to avoid.

Even my friends have commented on how much more energetic and positive I seem. I feel like I‚Äôve got my spark back‚Äînot just in my body, but in my mind and spirit too.

# Final Thoughts: Should You Buy MITOLYN?

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling tired, if you want more than just a temporary fix, I really think MITOLYN is worth a try. It‚Äôs not magic, but it‚Äôs as close as I‚Äôve come to finding something that helps my whole body feel better for real. It helped me get my life back, and I wish I‚Äôd found it sooner.

The only currency that mattered was mental health. Happiness, clarity, peace: these were the real treasures. Every citizen had a Mindscore, a soft glow above their heads, changing color with their emotional reserves.

You wanted a house? That would cost years of patience and trust.  
You needed food? You paid in calmness‚Äîjust a small sliver, a few minutes of inner quiet shaved away.

Basic food was cheap: dry bread, water, nutrient paste. Enough to keep people alive without bankrupting their minds. Luxuries‚Äîreal coffee, a ripe peach, a glass of wine‚Äîwere devastatingly expensive.

People became merchants of their own sanity. Some guarded it fiercely, living small and careful lives. Others burned through it for status, living large but cracking from the inside out.

Work was no easy escape. Jobs weren‚Äôt about making things anymore. They were about *producing* calmness‚Äîhelping others heal, building safe spaces, creating music, solving conflicts. You earned peace by growing it in yourself and sharing it with others. But Nova was exhausted. Her mind, once bright, was now a cracked mirror.

One evening, she found herself in a side alley, staring at a black door with no sign. Word on the street said there were places like this: illegal markets where you could *steal* stability from others. A fast fix. A quick rise.

She hesitated. She could feel the last thread of her self-control fraying. If she stepped inside, she might laugh again, breathe again. But it wouldn‚Äôt be *hers*.

Choosing the right teeth whitening method can be overwhelming, considering the multitude of options available. Let‚Äôs compare Philips Zoom Nite White 22 to some common alternatives:

*   **Over-the-Counter Whitening Strips:** While convenient and affordable, whitening strips typically contain a lower concentration of whitening agents than Philips Zoom Nite White 22. This translates to slower and less dramatic results.Moreover, they lack the custom fit of whitening trays, increasing the risk of uneven whitening and gum irritation.

*   **Whitening Toothpastes:** Whitening toothpastes primarily work by removing surface stains, but they do not bleach the teeth.Their whitening effect is limited compared to carbamide peroxide gels.They‚Äôre excellent for maintenance but not for achieving significant initial whitening.

*   **In-Office Whitening (e.g.,Philips Zoom WhiteSpeed):** In-office whitening treatments offer the fastest and most dramatic results,often utilizing high-intensity light to accelerate the whitening process. Tho, they are significantly more expensive than at-home options like Philips Zoom Nite White 22.

*   **Othre At-Home Whitening Gels (e.g., Day White):** Philips also offers *zoom nite white vs day white*. Day White contains a lower concentration of carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide and is designed for shorter wear times during the day. Nite White 22, with its higher concentration and overnight application, may offer more significant results for those who prefer to whiten while they sleep.

*   **Other Brands such as Opalescence:** Another popular at-home whitening system, Opalescence offers varying concentrations of carbamide peroxide. The choice between Opalescence and Philips Zoom Nite White often comes down to personal preferences regarding gel viscosity, taste, and sensitivity levels.

## Managing Sensitivity: Tips for a Comfortable Whitening Experience

Tooth sensitivity is a common side effect of teeth whitening, but it can be managed with a few simple strategies:

*   **Use a Desensitizing Toothpaste:** Brush with a desensitizing toothpaste containing potassium nitrate or stannous fluoride for at least two weeks prior to starting your whitening treatment. Continue using it throughout the whitening process.

*   **Shorten Wear Times:** If you experience significant sensitivity, try shortening the wear time of the whitening trays. you can gradually increase the wear time as your teeth become less sensitive.

*   **Skip a Day:** If sensitivity becomes too bothersome, take a day or two off from whitening to allow your teeth to recover.

*   **Use ACP Gel:** Consider using a Philips Zoom Nite White 22 formulation that contains ACP, which helps to reduce tooth sensitivity.

*   **Consult Your dentist:** If sensitivity persists despite these measures, consult your dentist for further advice.

1k8w7js,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1k8w7js/overcoming_nausea_during_a_marathon/,Overcoming nausea during a marathon?,"Hello all!

I finished my first marathon today, and to say that it did not go as planned would be the understatement of the century. I know the title is silly, so I'll try to explain as best as I can.

As a whole, my marathon training block went really well. I hit most of my runs, and peaked at around 50 miles/week. I also had stomach issues during a couple of long runs; however, after finding the right fueling combination, these seemed relatively manageable. Six weeks before the race, I ran a half marathon in 1:36. I was super proud of this, given the fact that I was sick the week of the race and threw up multiple times during the last several miles due to a caffeinated gel (which I vowed to never take again). This was also the first half marathon I haven't had either debilitating race anxiety or terrible mental blocks! My half time also showed strong marathon fitness. I knew that attaching a time goal to my first marathon may be ill-advised (especially given my history with anxiety), but I couldn't help thinking about what it would be like to qualify‚Äîor even come close to qualifying‚Äîfor Boston (which for my age group is a 3:25).

During marathon race week, I made sure to eat carbs when I could and drank plenty of water. I also felt pretty good about my fueling plan. I planned to take a gel every 4.5 miles (which is what I'd done during long runs) and get water at all 10 aid stations (even though I typically don't drink a ton of water during long runs, I was worried about the problems dehydration would cause later in the race).

On the morning of the race, I had overnight oats with dates and peanut butter two hours until start time. This is different than my normal long run breakfast‚Äîwhich I am now very much aware that I should not have done. I also had coffee an hour and a half before the race, which aligns with my long run schedule. I also wasn't able to properly go to the bathroom before the race. Both of these factors left me feeling full and clogged up at the starting line.

My stomach felt fine for the first several miles of the race, but it started sloshing around after the second water station around mile 4. My stomach was manageable (but not great) until mile 9, when I took my second gel. Around mile 11, I started to get extremely nauseous‚Äîwhich made me really anxious. The thought of running 15 more miles on an upset stomach did not seem pleasant to me. But I remembered that, despite my hopes for a miracle, the goal of my first marathon should be to have fun. Therefore, I tried to slow down to an easy run pace, and continued throwing up (just a bit of spit-up, not full-on barfing on the side of the course). Eventually, I started walking.

Once I started walking, it became almost unfathomably mentally difficult to start running again. I saw all of the people passing me, and I felt like a failure. This was supposed to be my big moment, and I felt like I'd ruined it by giving up after what could have been temporary nausea. I called my mom around mile 17 and asked her to pick me up. I was ready to be done.

When my family's car arrived around mile 18, my dad refused to let me in. He told me that regardless of my time, I would regret DNFing. I run/walked (but mostly walked) miles 18-22 with my sister and mom, and ended up running the rest. Those last 4 miles were, mentally and physically, the hardest I've ever run.

While I technically finished (and am glad I didn't DNF), I feel extremely defeated. Yes, I could see this race as a lesson about how to better fuel (and I intend to work with both a nutritionist and sports psychologist in the future, as there is clearly still a lot I don't know). However, I can't help but think how unreflective of my fitness it was, and I even question whether I'm mentally strong enough to truly run a marathon if I give up that early. I still want to qualify for Boston someday, but wonder when that will be possible.

So, this may be a long shot, but: How do you/can you overcome early stomach problems/nausea during a marathon? If so, what did you do to get yourself back on track? Thank you in advance, and sorry for the length!",1,1745730166.0,AdvancedRunning,3,0.6,False
1k8w72a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8w72a,COFFEE agar recipe in ketchup cups or petri dishes,"**This is a new recipe that I am confident will take off. Use if you would like and share for the love.**


**Equipment**


Pressure Cooker at 15psi

Steamer Basket 

Microwavable Silicone mat

A handeled cooking pot

Measuring cup

Measuring spoons

A stove top

PP5 plastic ketchup cups (link for them at the bottom of the page) or Petri Dishes and a SAB or Flow Hood 

Heavy Duty Tin Foil 


**Ingredients**

900mls of Distilled Water

100mls of coffee (I used Costco French Roast)

30grams of PDA agar powder (use LME or Agar Agar flakes if you prefer) 

40mls of Light Karo Corn Syrup

15mls of Erythritol 

15mls of Organic Honey

A pinch of Gypsum (or if you want an elevated pH a pinch of Lime)

So first and foremost set up your Pressure Cooker with a steamer basket if you have one and fill the water up underneath it and place a microwavable Silicone mat on top of it. The cups need to elevated out of the water. I put a splash of white vinegar into the water to prevent to much sediment sticking to the pressure cooker. Turn the stove on high but do not close the lid, leave it loosely on. Start placing your 50-65 cups or plates if you're using a whole liter for easy pouring. 

Now let's make the agar. 

Pour in 900mls of Distilled water and 100mls of coffee into your pot. Place it on the stove and start on medium heat. Next add in your 30 grams of Agar of your choice and stir. Measure out 40mls of Light Karo Corn Syrup and dump it in and continue stirring. Next add in 15mls if Erythritol which is a tablespoon and stir. Now pour 15mls of organic honey onto the same spoon and stir. (It should be hot enough to pull the honey off the spoon so you can dip it into the mix to get it all off). Last ingredient is up to you if you want to spike or buffer the pH balance. A pinch of gypsum to buffer the pH and a pinch of dehydrated lime to spike the pH. Mix everything together until it's 190¬∞ and pull it off and start pouring into your ketchup cups. 

[or if your using plates do it in front of your flow hood rapidly and seal them all before the temperature drops below 180¬∞ or in a SAB]

Next we need to put our lids on our ketchup cups and wrap them in tin foil like shown in the photos. 

Now your pressure cooker should be hot and be ready to go so take the lid off **again it's very important not to tighten the lid so it can't blow off while you're preheating your PC to save 5-10 minutes while it's heating up to easily pour and place them in your PC** and place your cups stacked in 3's evenly distributed throughout your pressure cooker. Once your PC reaches 15psi pressure cook for 20 minutes **add 5 minutes per thousand feet you live above sea level. If you live at 10,000ft still only at 45 minutes. And max at 45 additional minutes**

Allow your PC to depressurize naturally and then take off the lid. The tin foil should not be very hot because foil doesn't get hot but use a glove to be safe. And now you can start grabbing out the stacks of three and setting them level on the counter. They will congeal/harden and be ready within 20 minutes so you want to have them level so they don't congeal/harden crooked or at an angle.

Pat yourself on the back!!! You just made agar plates without needing a to worry about contamination because they are sealed unlike Petri Dishes. I prefer easily sealing my agar dishes and never having to worry about them being contaminated. These can be used right away so no more waiting to see if you did everything with perfect sterility.

Bring one of your preferred games, or join us and play whatever we have available that other members bring. 

Grab a coffee, a pastry of a sandwich and just chill while playing a game. Of course, if someone wants to play chess...they can. We may have to put checkers to bed, because although  people say they play checkers....for some reason, that doesn't seem to be the case. Checker players it seems are a dying breed. Sad. Smh. There's always chess. Or Risk. Or Scrabble, Or Uno, Skip Bo, Parchisi, Headache, Trouble..etc...etc ...etc .

If you're a chess player, who wants to improve their game, not only by testing your skills against our members, or if you have a loved one looking to get into chess, you might want to check out the Chessnut E-boards. 

Many of our members have picked one up. I reached out to the manufacturer to see if we could work together. I owned two of their boards, before I reached out to them. They agreed to be a sponsor and 'The Bayonne Chess Society & Club' has its own promo code, which gets us 20% off anything in their shop. It's a higher discount than their own discount on their website. 

The promo code is 'Bayonne.' Simple to remember. 

They have many models of E-boards. From the Chessnut Air...to the Chessnut Evo. Which by the way is the highest tech board currently on the market. They also have the Chessnut Go travel board. That's my go to board. They just came out with the Chessnut Move. The pieces move by themselves. Unfortunately, they won't play for you. They will beat you though. Just sayin'.

They have all types of boards. All superior quality, and excellently made products. Everyone in the group that has one... loves their boards. Promo code. again,  is 'Bayonne.' It's a no brainer.

Lastly, we also have a Youtube channel. Feel free to check out our videos. All shot at the different venues we play at. There's almost 80 videos up. Please like and subscribe. Gets us into the algorithm. Lets people know we have chess in Bayonne. We get a lot of players from other towns. The more the merrier.

P.D. I still haven't got into pre-trains. I usually get my protein shake with some fruit after work and before dinner, as a way to avoid eating other less healthy things.",3,1745729960.0,beginnerfitness,6,1.0,False
1k8w1ut,https://v.redd.it/lxdocema6bxe1,Dreamy Spots to Visit in Laguna?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm planning a solo trip to Laguna and would love some recommendations. I used to live in Paete, Laguna but I haven‚Äôt been back in three years. This time, I‚Äôm excited to revisit two of my absolute favorite places: Caliraya and Liliw, spots that always felt like a little escape when I was living there.

For this trip, I‚Äôm hoping to find dreamy, peaceful spots where I can slow down and breathe. I love sipping coffee with a beautiful view, whether it‚Äôs of nature or a quiet cityscape, and I‚Äôm always up for long scenic drives. I‚Äôll be traveling alone, just a law student on vacation hoping to savor some calm before bar review season starts.

If you know any cozy caf√©s, hidden nature spots, or quiet drives that feel like a warm hug, I would be so grateful for your suggestions.

Thank you so much.

Looking for little pockets of peace before the world speeds up again.

I literally just went to urgent care earlier today because I was scared that my baby and I were being bit by something. They told me that what we had looked viral (her pediatrician said the same) and not like bites from any pests, but then I saw this tonight. 

I‚Äôm so freaked out. I am a single mom, my room isn‚Äôt the cleanest, like I haven‚Äôt shampooed the carpet or dusted in a few months, but I am constantly doing laundry & the only dirty dish in my room is my coffee mug. 

I asked ChatGPT and it said it looks like a carpenter beetle. I do occasionally get those, but this doesn‚Äôt look like one to me, especially the way it squished. 

Could this be a bedbug?? We were at a hospital in the Bronx a couple of weeks ago & stayed at a family member‚Äôs house as well, but idk. We don‚Äôt have the three bites in a row that I saw online when I was looking up stuff.

Should I have stayed in Toronto? It‚Äôs the question I keep asking myself. If I knew what would happen when I moved to Greenwood, I‚Äôm sure I would have stayed as far away as possible. But if I had the chance to erase it all now, would I? I would be happier if I didn‚Äôt know what was out there, but it would be a lie.

¬†

Is having my eye open worth being forced to sleep with it open?

¬†

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs my job. It‚Äôs the life I chose, and I regret nothing about the life I chose. I believe that secrets, especially the darkest ones, need to be brought to light. So this is me, bringing them to light.

¬†

Journaling was a therapy thing at first, but it quickly became useful as a detective. Sorting feelings from facts, compartmentalizing, keeping things from getting personal. Its success rate varied. But in this case, it was a tool for compiling the events of last summer as I experienced them.

¬†

As of today, as I begin recounting that long waking nightmare, my birthday was three days ago. I got a t-shirt. Women‚Äôs medium. A replacement of one I lost. On my birthday last year, the only gift I got was from me to myself. That gift was moving to Greenwood, Nova Scotia. A place I had always loved, ever since visiting as a child.

¬†

I drove up there in my car on a sunny Tuesday morning. Daniels, my partner for two years in Toronto, followed me in his pick-up truck with all my furniture. I accumulated a fair few favors from the man in those two years and it was time to collect.

¬†

The air got better. The roads got worse. As I reached the first stretch of prairies, I knew I made the right choice. It was gorgeous. I drove with the windows down for hours and hours. I had made a whole new-wave pop-rock playlist for the road, but it turned out I didn‚Äôt need it. I just listened to the crashing of the wind, and I was happy. Even the smells made me smile. I‚Äôd take fresh farm manure over street pigeon shit any day.

¬†

We arrived Wednesday night and Daniels was off by Thursday morning. No emotional farewell, just a handshake and a ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù ‚Äì and there I was. Home, in a one-bedroom basement unit of a six unit building. It was quaint, modest, and a damn sight cheaper than Toronto. Mrs. Fredricks, the sweet old landlady swung by and was about as stark opposite from my old landlord as you could get. She even offered to help me unpack.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always good to get it done right away.‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúFirst you put it off one day, then you put it off one week, then before ya know it it‚Äôs two years later and you still got these damn boxes layin‚Äô around.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I know what you mean.‚Äù I replied, trying to match her friendliness to the best of my social ability.

¬†

‚ÄúDo you have more stuff coming, or?‚Äù She inquired.

¬†

‚ÄúNo, this is it.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWow. Light packer, eh?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah... It‚Äôs easier that way, I suppose.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat is it you do for work, hun?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm uh... I‚Äôm an RCMP Detective. Just transferred.‚Äù

¬†

Mrs. Fredricks‚Äô eyes lit up. I might as well have said I was in the circus.

¬†

‚ÄúReally? That‚Äôs fantastic! Well, I tell you what, I feel safer already.‚Äù

¬†

I expected to receive some big reactions like that. I didn‚Äôt exactly fit the rural law enforcement phenotype. But I was thoroughly charmed by her comment. She gave me a hug and told me to come see her if I needed anything. It was a warmer welcome than I could‚Äôve asked for.

¬†

Unpacking was going to have to wait, though. As would sightseeing and all else. I got my bare essentials out and ready, and then I had to prepare for work in the morning. No rest for the wicked.

¬†

Maybe I would have savored the day more if I had known it was going to be my last happy one. Before it all went to hell. Before the case, the nightmares, the girl who wasn‚Äôt missing... before Candle Caine.

  
\---



I woke myself up two minutes before my 5 AM alarm that day. Maybe it was the nerves. I was usually better about managing that sort of thing. In any case I was glad to wake up to silence. A little nugget of peace before the work begins.

¬†

The easiest way to ease nerves is to just stick to your routine, so that‚Äôs what I did. Starting with 15 push-ups, 15 sit-ups, 15 lunges, 15 squats, and three 30 second planks. Then stretches.

¬†

The sun had just begun shining through the blinds of my bedroom, casting deep orange lines against the far wall. In a way, it made it not look quite so bare. I made a mental note to make time to unpack more as soon as I could.

¬†

I showered, I brushed my teeth, and applied a trivial amount of make-up. Concealer and some mascara mainly. I typically wouldn‚Äôt bother but first impressions are important.

¬†

I didn‚Äôt have a chance to meal prep, but I had enough foresight to unpack some granola bars and coffee. It would do for now.

¬†

I left the apartment before 7 and arrived at my new HQ 10 minutes later.

¬†

‚ÄúHello miss, how may I help you?‚Äù The receptionist greeted with a smile and a drawl. She was teetering on elderly but not quite retirement age yet.

¬†

‚ÄúHi. Daria Cole, I‚Äôve just transferred here. I‚Äôm to speak with the Chief Inspector, I believe.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh, Miss Cole... We weren‚Äôt expecting you ‚Äòtil 8.‚Äù She responded, still sounding chipper.

¬†

‚ÄúI can wait if you like.‚Äù I offered.

¬†

‚ÄúOh no, he‚Äôs not doin‚Äô nothin‚Äô.‚Äù She turned around and began shouting, ‚ÄúLarry! I got Miss Cole here!‚Äù

¬†

Sure enough, out from the door in the back stepped a large man in a shirt and tie, brandishing a less enthusiastic smile then the receptionist.

¬†

‚ÄúCole! Right this way.‚Äù He said, gesturing me to follow as he held the door open.

¬†

We walked down some halls and past some cubicles. Functionally it was fairly similar to my previous employment, aesthetically it was far less so, but that was to be expected. The atmosphere was unkempt but homey. It was less clinical, less industrial, and I liked it. My first impression of my coworkers as I passed them was ‚Äúlackadaisical.‚Äú

¬†

The Chief Inspector led me into his office where he sat behind his desk. He gestured for me to take a seat and I obliged.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Chief Inspector Favret, we‚Äôve spoken on the phone. Welcome. How are you liking Greenwood so far?‚Äù He asked, somewhere between stilted pleasantry and curt.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs uh- it‚Äôs great, sir. Very peaceful.‚Äù I answered with a somewhat forced smile.

¬†

‚ÄúBit different from Toronto I reckon.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYes, sir. Big change.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs alright. I know you‚Äôll get used to it... It‚Äôs not all hicks here, you know.‚Äù

¬†

I forced a light chuckle in response. I couldn‚Äôt help feeling a subtle but immediate tension in the air. Either he was judging me, or he assumed I was judging him. Maybe both.

¬†

‚ÄúI mean it.‚Äù He continued. ‚ÄúYou may be the only... lady... we have here, but lots of folks come over from the big cities. You‚Äôll find many a kindred spirit I‚Äôm sure. In fact, your new partner was a New Yorker.‚Äù He explained.

¬†

‚ÄúMy new partner?‚Äù I questioned, suppressing a small cringe at the way he said ‚Äòlady‚Äô. Though, his cadence also made the words ‚ÄòNew Yorker‚Äô sound like an exotic animal.

¬†

‚ÄúOh yeah we got a spot for you, don‚Äôt worry. His recent partner quit, and he‚Äôs working a new assignment. Small stuff, easy start. So you‚Äôre gonna shadow him for a bit, and he can show you how we do things here. He‚Äôs been here a long time, so you‚Äôre in good hands.‚Äù He said with utmost assurance.

¬†

‚ÄúSounds good, sir.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúFantastic, I‚Äôm gonna leave the rest to Wally, you‚Äôll find him out there. Big white guy, beard, greying a bit. You‚Äôll know him when you see him.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThank you, sir.‚Äù I said as I stood up and made my way out of the thickened air of his office.

¬†

Outside among the cubicles I saw quite a few men, standing or lounging around and chatting. Almost all of them were large white guys with beards. Favret couldn‚Äôt have been less helpful. I had to use my ears instead. He said New Yorker, that shouldn‚Äôt be too tough to suss out in rural Canada.

¬†

‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not condensed milk, it‚Äôs evaporated milk. Condensed milk is sweetened-‚Äú Not him.

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a problem man. Two hundred dollars? What was it last time-‚Äú Not him.

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. No. It was overtime and he‚Äôs got the puck-‚Äù Definitely not him.

¬†

‚ÄúBro I swear to god if you call them Uggs one more time-‚Äú That‚Äôs the guy.

¬†

I waited for him to finish his somewhat hostile conversation and then I approached.

¬†

‚ÄúUh excuse me, are you... Wally?‚Äù

¬†

The man turned his head towards me with a scowl. He was a husky man. Tall, a little overweight, but he looked sturdy. I‚Äôd compare him to a fridge. He appeared to be somewhere in the early to mid 40s range, grizzled, with a messy beard and an unkempt undercut that was greying on the sides. He had a nose that looked like it was best friends with a baseball bat, its bridge winded like a country road. His eyes were dark and piercing, with surprisingly full lashes, though I wasn‚Äôt going to tell him that.

¬†

‚ÄúThe fuck did you say to me?‚Äù He snapped.

¬†

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm new here, the Chief Inspector told me-‚Äú

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, new girl. He was sayin‚Äô about that. Alright first of all, it ain‚Äôt Wally. That‚Äôs not my name. It‚Äôs Detective Gray, show some respect.‚Äù He said, about as prickly as humanly possible. The New York accent wasn‚Äôt front and center, but it was definitely there underneath all the gruff.

¬†

‚ÄúSorry, Detective Gray. Daria Cole, nice to meet you.‚Äù I said attempting to remain cordial and friendly as I extended my hand.

¬†

‚ÄúPsh.‚Äù He dismissed, rejecting the handshake. ‚ÄúYou been briefed on the case, yeah?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúUh... I have not. Favret told me you would brief me.‚Äù

¬†

Gray chuckled and seethed, ‚ÄúCourse he did... I‚Äôll catch you up in the car, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

¬†

He stood up and walked and I followed. I knew instantly he was going to be a pain in the ass to work with, but it wasn‚Äôt too dissimilar from people I‚Äôve had to work with before.

¬†

The rugged street punk from New York turned backwoods detective vibe threw me for a loop though. Beneath the harsh unpleasantness I was feeling, I was fascinated by him. What brought a guy like him to a place like this? Was it the same thing that brought me here?

¬†

We walked to his car. It was an old tan shitbox of some variety. Looked like it was from the 70s. I hopped in the passenger seat and he hopped in the driver‚Äôs.

¬†

‚ÄúLet me ask you somethin‚Äô... Cole, was it?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre young, right? You‚Äôre on that TikTok and shit?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not on TikTok, no.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBut you know about all that right?‚Äù

¬†

‚Äú...A little bit?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell, alright, doesn‚Äôt matter, so here‚Äôs the deal. Not to disappoint you on your first day but this case ain‚Äôt shit.‚Äù Gray explained. ‚ÄúMother tries to file a missing persons for her daughter, she‚Äôs been gone eight weeks, whatever, right? Turns out she ain‚Äôt missing at all because we check her, uh, ‚Äúsocials‚Äù and she‚Äôs in Paris on a vacation that her mom knew about the whole time.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúReally? So, why is this a case at all then?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not. She‚Äôs a nut. Her daughter posts these vlogs or TikToks daily ‚Äì apparently she‚Äôs even got a big following ‚Äì all from Paris talkin‚Äô bout how great it is eating fucking snails or whatever. But the mother still wants to file the report anyway. She won‚Äôt let it go.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúInteresting.‚Äù I answered.

¬†

‚ÄúAnnoying.‚Äù He countered. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre going to see her, and hopefully put a pin in this whole thing. That‚Äôs about it. Any questions?‚Äù

¬†

I shook my head.

¬†

‚ÄúGreat, I wasn‚Äôt gonna answer ‚Äòem anyway.‚Äù He quipped as we pealed off from the parking lot.

¬†

The drive was quiet and I felt the urge to ask him some basic questions. I didn‚Äôt care to be his friend, or to really know him on any level, but I needed this friction to ease up at least a little bit for my own sanity. I started with a softball.

¬†

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre not from here?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHa! Detective of the year over here folks.‚Äù

¬†

Funnily enough it was that one response that gave me all I needed to know about him. He was a miserable prick, sure. But he was also a jaw-jacker. A ball-buster. I put myself in a new frame of mind: Don‚Äôt take him too seriously, don‚Äôt be afraid of him, and try not to lose your cool.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat brought you here?‚Äù I asked.

¬†

He shook his head, ‚ÄúChrist, Cole. You want my life story?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell if we‚Äôre going to be working together...‚Äù

¬†

He laughed, ‚ÄúWe ain‚Äôt gonna be working together for long, trust me.‚Äù

¬†

I stopped talking. I guess he was content with the tension for now.

¬†

We arrived at a modest two story house which I could only assume belonged to the mother.

¬†

‚ÄúJust hang back and don‚Äôt talk. Hopefully we put this all to bed now.‚Äù Gray said as he knocked on the front door.

¬†

The door opened to a middle aged woman. Likely late 40s or early 50s. She was well put together, despite being a bit dishevelled. A look of deep concern was written on her face.

¬†

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù She spoke, cutting to the chase. ‚ÄúAny news?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHow are ya, Miss Lavoy?‚Äù Gray greeted, with a far less rough tone than I had experienced to this point.

¬†

Miss Lavoy walked away from the door, an unspoken invitation to let ourselves in.

¬†

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù She asked, pointing at me.

¬†

‚ÄúNew kid. Showin‚Äô her the ropes and all.‚Äù Gray responded. Another subtle way of taking the piss I figured. I guess I had to get used to this.

¬†

‚ÄúGreat. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve over here training people while my daughter‚Äôs missing.‚Äù Miss Lavoy admonished.

¬†

‚ÄúCome on Miss Lavoy, you know I take this seriously, but you gotta give me somethin‚Äô here. Make it make sense to me. Harmony‚Äôs in Paris. You know that. I know that. She‚Äôs not missing. You want her to come home, I get that, but what would you have me do, fly to Paris and grab her?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs NOT in Paris!‚Äù Miss Lavoy shouted.

¬†

Gray pulled out his phone, pulled up a video, and showed it to her.

¬†

‚ÄúShe posted this TODAY. She‚Äôs been posting all week. Look. Freaking Eiffel Tower‚Äôs in the background. Why do you think she isn‚Äôt there?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell maybe she is, but she doesn‚Äôt want to be. There‚Äôs just... Something‚Äôs wrong! You don‚Äôt get it! I can‚Äôt... You‚Äôre not her mother, you don‚Äôt know her.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhen was the last time you spoke to your daughter?‚Äù I piped in. Gray shot me a look but didn‚Äôt say anything.

¬†

‚ÄúLast time we spoke on the phone was a few days ago. It‚Äôs mostly texting with her.‚Äù

¬†

My interest was piquing. In what way could she be missing if she could take phone calls, return texts, and post vlogs? It sounded crazy but this woman didn‚Äôt seem crazy. Distressed, very much so, but not crazy.

¬†

‚ÄúAnd in these interactions, did you notice anything strange?‚Äù I prodded.

¬†

‚ÄúWell every time I‚Äôve phoned her she hasn‚Äôt been able to talk long. She always says she‚Äôs busy and she ends the call quick. I call her later and she says she‚Äôs too tired. There‚Äôs always an excuse.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAnd the texts?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just... normal. She tells me not to worry. She brushes it off, says it‚Äôs all fine.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo what exactly makes you think something‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI just know! This whole trip was wrong. She never mentioned it to me until a few days before she left, and even then it was by text. I talked to her friends and they said the same thing. Nobody knew about this trip. It came out of nowhere. Then ever since she left it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not even her mother anymore. She acts like I‚Äôm just another person. She tells me about where she goes and what she does ‚Äì this restaurant, that restaurant, whatever ‚Äì but it‚Äôs all just... nothing.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou think she‚Äôs hiding something?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúShe wouldn‚Äôt hide anything from me. That‚Äôs not the kind of person she is. This isn‚Äôt her. Whoever‚Äôs in those videos isn‚Äôt her.‚Äù

¬†

Gray stepped back into the conversation, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we try calling her now, huh? We can all hash this out.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah! I‚Äôll call her up now, put her on speaker.‚Äù Miss Lavoy responded, pulling out her phone and dialing.

¬†

It rang and rang and there was no answer. She frowned as we looked on expectantly.

¬†

‚ÄúHang on let me try again.‚Äù

¬†

This time after a few rings, someone picked up.

¬†

‚ÄúHey mom.‚Äù A young woman‚Äôs voice answered.

¬†

‚ÄúHey sweetheart, are you alone right now?‚Äù Miss Lavoy asked.

¬†

‚ÄúUh, yeah, but I‚Äôm actually just about to-‚Äú

¬†

‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôve got some detectives with me here, and I need you to tell us what‚Äôs going on, alright sweetie?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat... What are you...‚Äù The voice on the phone stammered with embarrassment.

¬†

‚ÄúHey there Harmony.‚Äù Gray spoke into the phone. ‚ÄúListen, your mother‚Äôs worried about you and we just wanna make sure everything‚Äôs good over there, alright?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh my gosh...‚Äù Harmony exclaimed with irritation. ‚ÄúMom I told you everything‚Äôs fine! I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre so worried about! I promise I‚Äôm more than okay. I know I extended the trip, but I just wasn‚Äôt ready to leave yet! I‚Äôll be home in just a few more days.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHarmony, are you sure nothing‚Äôs wrong? You have nothing to tell us?‚Äù I prodded.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about this. I promise there is nothing going on. I just wanted to go on a trip and see the world. My online business kind of took off so I got some money and it just felt like the right time. I‚Äôve never left Nova Scotia before so it was a big step... Look I‚Äôm sorry, I gotta go. Is there anything else I can help you with?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo, that won‚Äôt be necessary, thank you.‚Äù I answered.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you soon, okay mom? I love you.‚Äù Harmony said before hanging up the phone.

¬†

Gray shrugged and threw up his hands, ‚ÄúSo... She seems perfectly alright to me. You‚Äôre worried about your kid being far away from home, I get it. But everything seems fine here. There‚Äôs nothing for us to do.‚Äù

¬†

Miss Lavoy just sighed deeply and shook her head. She was clearly trying to articulate some kind of protest but couldn‚Äôt find the words. Unfortunately for her, Gray was right. There was nothing for us to do. We left shortly after.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat did I say about not talking?‚Äù Gray said as we walked back to the car. I had a feeling he would be sour about that.

¬†

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù I remarked, not hiding my insincerity.

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, yeah. First day, already not taking orders. Good shit.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt aware you were my superior.‚Äù I snipped. My impulses got the better of me.

¬†

Gray laughed. ‚ÄúAre you always this charming?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThat depends, are you always a moody prick?‚Äù I may have overstepped.

¬†

Gray smiled through gritted teeth, ‚ÄúLet me let you in on a little secret, Cole. You know why you‚Äôre partnered with me? It aint cause we‚Äôre both ‚Äúcity folk.‚Äù It‚Äôs cause they don‚Äôt want you here. You can have your guess as to why that is, but that‚Äôs the fact. The sooner you figure that out and just quit, the better it‚Äôll be for both of us.‚Äù

¬†

I suspected he was probably right about that. But it changed nothing.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not quitting.‚Äù I answered, getting into the passenger seat of his car.

¬†

Gray got in the driver‚Äôs seat and shot me a ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see‚Äù look.

¬†

‚ÄúYou may want to reflect on why they thought making you someone‚Äôs partner would be the best way to make them quit.‚Äù I added.

¬†

‚ÄúOh I know why.‚Äù Gray answered. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm a moody prick.‚Äù

¬†

The rest of the day was uneventful and more than mildly unpleasant, but I felt better having had that little spat with Gray. At least we each knew where we stood. I got home to my dark basement apartment, relieved to be done with it for now.

¬†

Yet, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the case. It was essentially closed after today, even though it had barely been open, but still it nagged at me. I had questions. I wanted to know more, I wanted to see more.

¬†

I unpacked my laptop and sat on my bed. I pulled up all of Harmony‚Äôs online profiles just to see if I could find anything. I wasn‚Äôt the most social media savvy person in the world, but I had to have a look.

¬†

The first thing that jumped out at me was the number of followers. Gray wasn‚Äôt kidding when he said she had a big following. She was in the high tens of thousands, encroaching upon the hundred. For a small town Canadian girl, that must have been quite impressive.

¬†

On the phone she mentioned an online business. I had a feeling of what that meant based on how awkwardly she said it in the presence of her mother. Her public profiles made no mention of it, but a minute amount of sleuthing led me to alternate profiles. Instantly adorned in racier photos. Links in the description to various Not Safe For Work subscription services. Pinned posts detailing the content she offered. Fair play to her. I wondered how she broached the subject with her mom. Her mom seems a more uptight and conservative type. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me one bit if she kept this side of her a secret.

¬†

My new initial thought was that this Paris trip wasn‚Äôt just a vacation and it was instead some kind of collaboration. She networked with other NSFW creators, and went down there to make more content for her fans. That explains the shifty behavior, she obviously didn‚Äôt want her mother to know. That all adds up. Case closed.

¬†

But I wanted to try one more thing. Just to dot the I‚Äôs and cross the t‚Äôs. Directly compare a vlog from Paris with one made before. See if there were any discrepancies in her behavior or anything else that might indicate some kind of change. I chose the first vlog from Paris, and a random one from a month earlier with a similar thumbnail.

¬†

To my naked eye, the videos themselves looked innocuous enough. Her mood and attitude appeared the same. I moved to the descriptions and they were both formatted similarly. She replied to a few comments and spoke the same way on each. Similar verbiage, use of punctuation (she likes using double hyphens and the letter u instead of you) it all seemed to check out. Location services confirmed Paris as the location of the post, as if my eyes weren‚Äôt enough to see. It was airtight.

¬†

I went through a few more of her videos, at this point just because I had nothing better to do. It was all relatively the same. Talking to the camera. Sightseeing. Standard stuff. She spent one of the nights in Belgium, that was mildly eventful I suppose.

¬†

Videos before the trip were similarly standard. Some unboxing videos, some trends, some general vlogs. It wasn‚Äôt really my scene, but I could see why people liked it. There was a coziness to it. The crude comments gave me some insight into the ulterior appeal of it as well. She was, after all, very pretty. I was a bit envious of her blue eyes. They were very bright blue and piercing, almost hypnotic. Mine were closer to her mother‚Äôs, a dark greenish hazel.

¬†

Harmony seemed like a happy person. Always smiling, always chipper. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel it was a bit hollow. Which I can understand, it‚Äôs a social media persona. You play it up for the fans. Though there was a sincerity in her older videos that I felt was lacking in the Paris ones. Maybe the passion wasn‚Äôt there anymore, who knows.

¬†

All I knew was it was time for me to go to bed. This case was closed. It was time to empty my mind of it and prepare for the next thing Gray would drag me to.

¬†

The second day on the job in Greenwood went by monotonously. The case load in Toronto versus the case load here couldn‚Äôt have been more different. In Toronto we had plenty of local police to handle the small things so we could focus on the multitude of larger, more dangerous issues. Greenwood only had us, but also Greenwood only had about 5,000 people. Even including nearby counties like Coldbrook and Kingston which we dealt with, it didn‚Äôt come out to a fraction of downtown.

¬†

Gray wasn‚Äôt much less unpleasant this day either. He gave me shit about just about everything. I worked on remaining stoic to the best of my power. I wasn‚Äôt sure if he hated me, if it amused him trying to get a rise out of me, if he was trying to make me quit, or if it was just his personality. Either way, I would ignore it and carry on with the mundanity.

¬†

It wasn‚Äôt until the day after that something else noteworthy happened. More than noteworthy, in fact. It was still early in the morning. A call came in about a disturbance at the local soup kitchen. They said a homeless man was causing a scene. Raving and ranting, and waving a knife around. Gray and I were close, dealing with a petty larceny ‚Äì far below my pay grade, but such is the job. We went to the scene.

¬†

‚ÄúBlessings‚Äù was written in blue italics on a white banner hanging on the front of a rickety little building that was also painted white. There were crosses on the windows. It looked like a house or a small school that had been refurbished and repurposed. Such was the case for many places around here.

¬†

The shouting was audible from outside, as were the sounds of metal clattering. We made our way inside swiftly.

¬†

A raggedy older man stood with his back to the near corner of the cafeteria seating. He held a butcher‚Äôs knife out at arm‚Äôs length, god knows how he got it, while the terrified volunteer staff circled him from a distance with their palms out, attempting to show that they mean him no harm. His eyes were bloodshot and bugged out. He was screaming nonsense.

¬†

Gray and I took control of the room. I stepped out in front of the staff while Gray backed them off. I looked the man in his bulging eyes, attempting to decipher his words before offering my own.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in me! It‚Äôs in me! They poison me!‚Äù He screamed.

¬†

‚ÄúSir, I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs poisoning you. Let‚Äôs put down the knife, okay? Let‚Äôs talk.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNO! They want me to do it, but I won‚Äôt do it! No more! It‚Äôs the bees stinging my brain! They all serve the queen! I won‚Äôt be their bee! They can sting and sting! They can suck the pollen out! They can eat me like a bug, but I won‚Äôt! No more poison! Burn it all! Melt it all!‚Äù

¬†

I‚Äôve heard some insane rambling in my time but that was up there. I needed him to calm down.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù I shouted through his babbling.

¬†

‚ÄúMy... My name? You want my name!? Why!?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBecause I want to talk. That‚Äôs all. Just talk. What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... It‚Äôs Melvin.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOkay, Melvin. My name is Daria. Now I need you to take a breath. You don‚Äôt want to hurt anybody, do you?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo... No... I don‚Äôt want to hurt anybody.‚Äù He said shakily. I took one slow step towards him and he allowed it without protest.

¬†

‚ÄúGood. So just give me the knife, and we can figure this out. I can‚Äôt help you if you‚Äôre pointing a knife at me, you understand?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not me... it‚Äôs them! It‚Äôs everyone! Soon it‚Äôll be everyone! Melting in the dark! I see it! I see the horns of Satan himself, but it‚Äôs a lie!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMelvin, deep breath.‚Äù I instructed. ‚ÄúI want to help you but, see, I‚Äôm new here. I‚Äôm from the city. So I don‚Äôt know what you mean when you say these things. Can you just hand me the knife and then explain everything to me calmly?‚Äù

¬†

Melvin didn‚Äôt budge, but his hand shook and he began to sob. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand... An eye for an eye... The window is open... The father...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAnd the girl... she‚Äôs not missing.‚Äù

¬†

Those words caught my attention for some reason. They were too specific. Too directed.

¬†

‚ÄúThe girl?‚Äù I asked.

¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not missing... but she‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWho? What do you mean?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOne eye missing, one eye gone. One eye open, two eyes closed, third eye open. Melting, melting, melting, melting...‚Äù He raved in manic whispers.

¬†

‚ÄúMelvin...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt be me. Won‚Äôt be me. Pluck it out. Stop the sting. Drink, drink, drink. He‚Äôs coming here, I‚Äôll go there. He‚Äôll walk again, but not in skin. Never skin. The holes don‚Äôt have eyes but they will. They will be his not hers. Hers will be missing but she will be gone. Gone from her skin. Lost in her eye.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMelvin, look at me.‚Äù I said, taking another slow step forward.

¬†

Melvin did as I asked and stared into my eyes. He took a deep breath and uttered ‚ÄúI now belong to Candle Caine.‚Äù

¬†

In one frantic motion, he turned the knife to his own throat and closed his eyes tight.

¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt!‚Äù I shouted as I sprinted towards him, but it was too late.

¬†

He plunged the knife into his throat. Instantly blood poured and belched out from the wound. I did what I could, but it was in deep. All the way to the hilt. He shook, convulsed, and gurgled. Then he was gone, and it was quiet. The worst kind of quiet.

¬†

The ambulance came and took his body. Gray and I stuck around to take care of the traumatized patrons and staff. A man came up and introduced himself as the owner, Mr. Ray Whitley. An older, gangly sort of man with a wisp of white hair. We questioned him briefly.

¬†

‚ÄúDid Melvin come around here often?‚Äù Gray asked.

¬†

‚ÄúYeah... Yeah he did, he was one of our regulars. Never seen him act like... I mean... I don‚Äôt know...‚Äù Whitley said, in a somber shellshock.

¬†

‚ÄúDid you know much about him? Did he have family here or anything?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHe used to always talk about his niece, Annabelle... I don‚Äôt think she lived around here though. He didn‚Äôt like to talk about himself much. I imagine he just fell on hard times. It‚Äôs rough out there, you know?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh, that I know. For sure. I mean, shit, I wish I had a place like this back in the day.‚Äù Gray remarked, probably trying to quell the dread.

¬†

‚ÄúWell... It‚Äôs just Nova Scotia hospitality I guess.‚Äù Whitley responded humbly.

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, New York hospitality is a little different... But for real, I admire what you do, lookin‚Äô out for people. You take care now. Call if anything else comes to mind.‚Äù

¬†

Gray definitely had a way with people. A charm, and a disarming sort of charisma. So antithetical to the asshole he usually was.

¬†

We stepped outside and took in some air. The silence lingered for a while before he spoke.

¬†

‚ÄúFirst time seeing someone die?‚Äù He asked.

¬†

‚ÄúNo...‚Äù I answered.

¬†

‚ÄúWell... You did alright, kid. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up.‚Äù

¬†

The word ‚Äòkid‚Äô aside, that was by far the nicest thing he said to me thus far.

¬†

‚ÄúThe way he was acting... The things he said...‚Äù I thought out loud.

¬†

‚ÄúFucking nuts.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah but... I‚Äôve seen manic episodes, schizophrenia, delusions, bad trips... I‚Äôve dealt with lots of those in Toronto. This felt different... And what is Candle Caine? Have you ever heard of that?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo idea. Sounds like a high school mascot or somethin‚Äô... Maybe he was trying to say ‚Äòcandy cane‚Äô...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt really make sense in context though...‚Äù

¬†

Gray dismissively snorted, ‚ÄúWhat fucking context, Cole? The man was out of it. He was gone. He stuck a knife in his jugular, that‚Äôs the context.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs it? You don‚Äôt even want to look into it? You don‚Äôt wanna do your job?‚Äù I snipped.

¬†

‚ÄúOh fuck off. We‚Äôll look into it. I‚Äôm just sayin‚Äô... You know last month there was a graverobbing over in Meadowvale. Just a random, old, unmarked grave. They still don‚Äôt know who did it or why, they don‚Äôt know dick all. Last I checked they didn‚Äôt even know who the fuck the grave belonged to. All they know is some freak dug up a skeleton.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOkay, why are you telling me this?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBecause sometimes people do weird shit. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt make sense and it never will and we just have to be okay with that. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt do your job, I‚Äôm just saying be prepared to not tie it all in a fucking bow.‚Äù Gray explained.

¬†

I rolled my eyes. To me it just sounded like laziness.

¬†

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù A frail and solemn voice called out from down the sidewalk. Another scruffy looking man with an overgrown beard approached us, visibly a few years younger. ‚ÄúFran told me what happened to Melvin, I was just on my way here... You‚Äôre the cops? You saw it all?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah...‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúDid you know him?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWe... We played cribbage... Nobody else knew how to play. They call it an old person game... He won almost every time. I beat him one time, just one... He was my friend...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt have... He wasn‚Äôt... Ugh... He was saving up. He was gonna buy his niece a gift for her 7th birthday. I kept tellin‚Äô him ‚Äúyou use that money for yourself, you idiot.‚Äù But he was so excited, he was clean, it was the first birthday of her life he could actually buy her something... He wouldn‚Äôt just...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHe sounds like he was a good man...‚Äù I said. It was hard to stifle my heartache upon hearing that.

¬†

‚ÄúHe was... I‚Äôm sorry... Are you okay?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMe? Yeah. Yeah I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù I said, taken slightly aback by the man‚Äôs consideration. ‚ÄúAre you?‚Äù

¬†

The man let out a deep sigh. ‚ÄúYeah... It just don‚Äôt make sense...‚Äù

¬†

He was right... it didn‚Äôt. He walked away, his head hung. I felt for him. This part is never easy. You always wish for the right sequence of words to make it a little bit better, but most of the time no such words exist. You just have to watch as peoples‚Äô worlds crumble, and try to feel secure on the knowledge that you did all you could, even if your brain constantly tells you otherwise.

¬†

There was a constant urge to dehumanize tragedy, to make it easier to manage. It helps with the job, and it helps life in general not be so crushing. But sometimes the humanity of it all just smacks you in the face. Today was one of those days. Gray and I left shortly after, but I couldn‚Äôt get it out of my head. Any of it.

¬†

The girl isn‚Äôt missing... I couldn‚Äôt help but think of Harmony, but we already knew she wasn‚Äôt missing. We knew where she was, and I had a good idea of why she was there. There was no case. He must have meant someone else... but who? And what the hell was Candle Caine?",2,1745729204.0,SlumberReads,0,1.0,False

I'm not sure what intention started this cursor from left to right, stringing Verdana letters together as the *clickety-clack* forms an audible almost-language all its own.  I couldn't say why, but there is near as much solace in that sound as in the words that are formed.  I suppose that's why I'm writing this.  The sentences become a melody, playing to a keystroke beat that speaks to the melancholy that's claimed the spotlight tonight.

There's so much I wanted to tell you, but I didn't know how.  I suppose I still don't.  It seems strange to miss someone you let go, for no other reason than that you didn't know how *not to*.  But there it is.

We spend our lives in a small bubble - our own creation - where everything is comfortable.  Familiar.  Known.¬† *Safe*.  We don't often wonder at the missed opportunities.  The connections that could have been.  The souls out there that would, given the chance, harmonize instantly with our own to create a song we've never heard but to which we'd instantly know the lyrics.

No, we stroll on - heads down, hoodies up - and cast a two-second glance and a courteous half-smile at our¬†*soulmate*¬†as we pass them wordlessly on the street, never to be seen again.

Nothing ventured, nothing¬†**lost**, right?  It feels like a reliable strategy.  Most of the time.  Yet, sometimes - sometimes, the¬†*what ifs*¬†come knocking. In moments like these, we do strange things - like write a letter to no one.  Or everyone.  Perhaps it's just for my own amusement - to seek the cathartic effect provided by turning thoughts into pixels and then spreading them across cyberspace like dandelion seeds in the wind.

I hope there are words out there that coalesce into a tune that brings you joy as well.

Sincerely,

...

Photography and motorcycling are huge parts of my life. I spend a lot of time exploring the world through a camera lens and from the seat of my bike.

And if motorcycling isn‚Äôt your thing, no worries‚Äîroad trips in the car with great conversation, cozy diners, and discovering hidden gems are just as special to me.

Let‚Äôs take it one adventure at a time and see where the road leads us. Tell me about your favorite scenic spot or a place you‚Äôve always wanted to explore‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear about it.

Water grounds me. Showering was my favorite part of the day. You are the shampoo, the soap, the towel - you remove the extraneous, the unnecessary, the unwanted. You are the comfort and cover before the trials of the day begin.

You are the caffeine in my coffee. The warmth in my belly. You are the food I eat and the pills I take to keep the demons and sickness at bay. 

You weren‚Äôt a part of my life yet, not in the way I know you now. But you have always been there - the sanity to my madness and the buoy at my drop off. Thank you for being the safety cable at the dam before the end of all things. Thank you for making sure I never strayed too far, for making sure I actually found my way to you in this life. 

I have always fought, puffed chest and inflamed pride, for everything I have. For the first time my softness has been accepted, appreciated, maybe even loved. You see me for that and for what I have been and whatever truth exists in between. You make me feel like there is room for all of me with you. You are my introversion, my safe haven, my journal entries, the gooey center that kept me going through the things that made me swear I wasn‚Äôt built correctly, wasn‚Äôt built strong enough to survive. I always wanted to believe that the conclusion was love, belonging - peace. Finding the way there drove me mad more times than I can count. But I look back, grateful, knowing you were guiding me to exactly that all along. 

In return, though it‚Äôs not my line, I want you to know love like it‚Äôs your name. I want you to look at the stars, the sunrise, the way the leaves change and water cuts stone and scoff because you know that they are just trying to mimic your beauty and power. Science can explain away every beautiful thing in the natural world but nothing I nor human kind understands can explain you. You are cosmic, karmic - fate or destiny or the universe personified.

Should I have stayed in Toronto? It‚Äôs the question I keep asking myself. If I knew what would happen when I moved to Greenwood, I‚Äôm sure I would have stayed as far away as possible. But if I had the chance to erase it all now, would I? I would be happier if I didn‚Äôt know what was out there, but it would be a lie.

¬†

Is having my eye open worth being forced to sleep with it open?

¬†

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs my job. It‚Äôs the life I chose, and I regret nothing about the life I chose. I believe that secrets, especially the darkest ones, need to be brought to light. So this is me, bringing them to light.

¬†

Journaling was a therapy thing at first, but it quickly became useful as a detective. Sorting feelings from facts, compartmentalizing, keeping things from getting personal. Its success rate varied. But in this case, it was a tool for compiling the events of last summer as I experienced them.

¬†

As of today, as I begin recounting that long waking nightmare, my birthday was three days ago. I got a t-shirt. Women‚Äôs medium. A replacement of one I lost. On my birthday last year, the only gift I got was from me to myself. That gift was moving to Greenwood, Nova Scotia. A place I had always loved, ever since visiting as a child.

¬†

I drove up there in my car on a sunny Tuesday morning. Daniels, my partner for two years in Toronto, followed me in his pick-up truck with all my furniture. I accumulated a fair few favors from the man in those two years and it was time to collect.

¬†

The air got better. The roads got worse. As I reached the first stretch of prairies, I knew I made the right choice. It was gorgeous. I drove with the windows down for hours and hours. I had made a whole new-wave pop-rock playlist for the road, but it turned out I didn‚Äôt need it. I just listened to the crashing of the wind, and I was happy. Even the smells made me smile. I‚Äôd take fresh farm manure over street pigeon shit any day.

¬†

We arrived Wednesday night and Daniels was off by Thursday morning. No emotional farewell, just a handshake and a ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù ‚Äì and there I was. Home, in a one-bedroom basement unit of a six unit building. It was quaint, modest, and a damn sight cheaper than Toronto. Mrs. Fredricks, the sweet old landlady swung by and was about as stark opposite from my old landlord as you could get. She even offered to help me unpack.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always good to get it done right away.‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúFirst you put it off one day, then you put it off one week, then before ya know it it‚Äôs two years later and you still got these damn boxes layin‚Äô around.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I know what you mean.‚Äù I replied, trying to match her friendliness to the best of my social ability.

¬†

‚ÄúDo you have more stuff coming, or?‚Äù She inquired.

¬†

‚ÄúNo, this is it.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWow. Light packer, eh?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah... It‚Äôs easier that way, I suppose.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat is it you do for work, hun?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm uh... I‚Äôm an RCMP Detective. Just transferred.‚Äù

¬†

Mrs. Fredricks‚Äô eyes lit up. I might as well have said I was in the circus.

¬†

‚ÄúReally? That‚Äôs fantastic! Well, I tell you what, I feel safer already.‚Äù

¬†

I expected to receive some big reactions like that. I didn‚Äôt exactly fit the rural law enforcement phenotype. But I was thoroughly charmed by her comment. She gave me a hug and told me to come see her if I needed anything. It was a warmer welcome than I could‚Äôve asked for.

¬†

Unpacking was going to have to wait, though. As would sightseeing and all else. I got my bare essentials out and ready, and then I had to prepare for work in the morning. No rest for the wicked.

¬†

Maybe I would have savored the day more if I had known it was going to be my last happy one. Before it all went to hell. Before the case, the nightmares, the girl who wasn‚Äôt missing... before Candle Caine.



I woke myself up two minutes before my 5 AM alarm that day. Maybe it was the nerves. I was usually better about managing that sort of thing. In any case I was glad to wake up to silence. A little nugget of peace before the work begins.

¬†

The easiest way to ease nerves is to just stick to your routine, so that‚Äôs what I did. Starting with 15 push-ups, 15 sit-ups, 15 lunges, 15 squats, and three 30 second planks. Then stretches.

¬†

The sun had just begun shining through the blinds of my bedroom, casting deep orange lines against the far wall. In a way, it made it not look quite so bare. I made a mental note to make time to unpack more as soon as I could.

¬†

I showered, I brushed my teeth, and applied a trivial amount of make-up. Concealer and some mascara mainly. I typically wouldn‚Äôt bother but first impressions are important.

¬†

I didn‚Äôt have a chance to meal prep, but I had enough foresight to unpack some granola bars and coffee. It would do for now.

¬†

I left the apartment before 7 and arrived at my new HQ 10 minutes later.

¬†

‚ÄúHello miss, how may I help you?‚Äù The receptionist greeted with a smile and a drawl. She was teetering on elderly but not quite retirement age yet.

¬†

‚ÄúHi. Daria Cole, I‚Äôve just transferred here. I‚Äôm to speak with the Chief Inspector, I believe.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh, Miss Cole... We weren‚Äôt expecting you ‚Äòtil 8.‚Äù She responded, still sounding chipper.

¬†

‚ÄúI can wait if you like.‚Äù I offered.

¬†

‚ÄúOh no, he‚Äôs not doin‚Äô nothin‚Äô.‚Äù She turned around and began shouting, ‚ÄúLarry! I got Miss Cole here!‚Äù

¬†

Sure enough, out from the door in the back stepped a large man in a shirt and tie, brandishing a less enthusiastic smile then the receptionist.

¬†

‚ÄúCole! Right this way.‚Äù He said, gesturing me to follow as he held the door open.

¬†

We walked down some halls and past some cubicles. Functionally it was fairly similar to my previous employment, aesthetically it was far less so, but that was to be expected. The atmosphere was unkempt but homey. It was less clinical, less industrial, and I liked it. My first impression of my coworkers as I passed them was ‚Äúlackadaisical.‚Äú

¬†

The Chief Inspector led me into his office where he sat behind his desk. He gestured for me to take a seat and I obliged.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Chief Inspector Favret, we‚Äôve spoken on the phone. Welcome. How are you liking Greenwood so far?‚Äù He asked, somewhere between stilted pleasantry and curt.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs uh- it‚Äôs great, sir. Very peaceful.‚Äù I answered with a somewhat forced smile.

¬†

‚ÄúBit different from Toronto I reckon.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYes, sir. Big change.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs alright. I know you‚Äôll get used to it... It‚Äôs not all hicks here, you know.‚Äù

¬†

I forced a light chuckle in response. I couldn‚Äôt help feeling a subtle but immediate tension in the air. Either he was judging me, or he assumed I was judging him. Maybe both.

¬†

‚ÄúI mean it.‚Äù He continued. ‚ÄúYou may be the only... lady... we have here, but lots of folks come over from the big cities. You‚Äôll find many a kindred spirit I‚Äôm sure. In fact, your new partner was a New Yorker.‚Äù He explained.

¬†

‚ÄúMy new partner?‚Äù I questioned, suppressing a small cringe at the way he said ‚Äòlady‚Äô. Though, his cadence also made the words ‚ÄòNew Yorker‚Äô sound like an exotic animal.

¬†

‚ÄúOh yeah we got a spot for you, don‚Äôt worry. His recent partner quit, and he‚Äôs working a new assignment. Small stuff, easy start. So you‚Äôre gonna shadow him for a bit, and he can show you how we do things here. He‚Äôs been here a long time, so you‚Äôre in good hands.‚Äù He said with utmost assurance.

¬†

‚ÄúSounds good, sir.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúFantastic, I‚Äôm gonna leave the rest to Wally, you‚Äôll find him out there. Big white guy, beard, greying a bit. You‚Äôll know him when you see him.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThank you, sir.‚Äù I said as I stood up and made my way out of the thickened air of his office.

¬†

Outside among the cubicles I saw quite a few men, standing or lounging around and chatting. Almost all of them were large white guys with beards. Favret couldn‚Äôt have been less helpful. I had to use my ears instead. He said New Yorker, that shouldn‚Äôt be too tough to suss out in rural Canada.

¬†

‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs not condensed milk, it‚Äôs evaporated milk. Condensed milk is sweetened-‚Äú Not him.

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a problem man. Two hundred dollars? What was it last time-‚Äú Not him.

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. No. It was overtime and he‚Äôs got the puck-‚Äù Definitely not him.

¬†

‚ÄúBro I swear to god if you call them Uggs one more time-‚Äú That‚Äôs the guy.

¬†

I waited for him to finish his somewhat hostile conversation and then I approached.

¬†

‚ÄúUh excuse me, are you... Wally?‚Äù

¬†

The man turned his head towards me with a scowl. He was a husky man. Tall, a little overweight, but he looked sturdy. I‚Äôd compare him to a fridge. He appeared to be somewhere in the early to mid 40s range, grizzled, with a messy beard and an unkempt undercut that was greying on the sides. He had a nose that looked like it was best friends with a baseball bat, its bridge winded like a country road. His eyes were dark and piercing, with surprisingly full lashes, though I wasn‚Äôt going to tell him that.

¬†

‚ÄúThe fuck did you say to me?‚Äù He snapped.

¬†

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm new here, the Chief Inspector told me-‚Äú

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, new girl. He was sayin‚Äô about that. Alright first of all, it ain‚Äôt Wally. That‚Äôs not my name. It‚Äôs Detective Gray, show some respect.‚Äù He said, about as prickly as humanly possible. The New York accent wasn‚Äôt front and center, but it was definitely there underneath all the gruff.

¬†

‚ÄúSorry, Detective Gray. Daria Cole, nice to meet you.‚Äù I said attempting to remain cordial and friendly as I extended my hand.

¬†

‚ÄúPsh.‚Äù He dismissed, rejecting the handshake. ‚ÄúYou been briefed on the case, yeah?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúUh... I have not. Favret told me you would brief me.‚Äù

¬†

Gray chuckled and seethed, ‚ÄúCourse he did... I‚Äôll catch you up in the car, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

¬†

He stood up and walked and I followed. I knew instantly he was going to be a pain in the ass to work with, but it wasn‚Äôt too dissimilar from people I‚Äôve had to work with before.

¬†

The rugged street punk from New York turned backwoods detective vibe threw me for a loop though. Beneath the harsh unpleasantness I was feeling, I was fascinated by him. What brought a guy like him to a place like this? Was it the same thing that brought me here?

¬†

We walked to his car. It was an old tan shitbox of some variety. Looked like it was from the 70s. I hopped in the passenger seat and he hopped in the driver‚Äôs.

¬†

‚ÄúLet me ask you somethin‚Äô... Cole, was it?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre young, right? You‚Äôre on that TikTok and shit?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not on TikTok, no.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBut you know about all that right?‚Äù

¬†

‚Äú...A little bit?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell, alright, doesn‚Äôt matter, so here‚Äôs the deal. Not to disappoint you on your first day but this case ain‚Äôt shit.‚Äù Gray explained. ‚ÄúMother tries to file a missing persons for her daughter, she‚Äôs been gone eight weeks, whatever, right? Turns out she ain‚Äôt missing at all because we check her, uh, ‚Äúsocials‚Äù and she‚Äôs in Paris on a vacation that her mom knew about the whole time.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúReally? So, why is this a case at all then?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not. She‚Äôs a nut. Her daughter posts these vlogs or TikToks daily ‚Äì apparently she‚Äôs even got a big following ‚Äì all from Paris talkin‚Äô bout how great it is eating fucking snails or whatever. But the mother still wants to file the report anyway. She won‚Äôt let it go.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúInteresting.‚Äù I answered.

¬†

‚ÄúAnnoying.‚Äù He countered. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre going to see her, and hopefully put a pin in this whole thing. That‚Äôs about it. Any questions?‚Äù

¬†

I shook my head.

¬†

‚ÄúGreat, I wasn‚Äôt gonna answer ‚Äòem anyway.‚Äù He quipped as we pealed off from the parking lot.

¬†

The drive was quiet and I felt the urge to ask him some basic questions. I didn‚Äôt care to be his friend, or to really know him on any level, but I needed this friction to ease up at least a little bit for my own sanity. I started with a softball.

¬†

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre not from here?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHa! Detective of the year over here folks.‚Äù

¬†

Funnily enough it was that one response that gave me all I needed to know about him. He was a miserable prick, sure. But he was also a jaw-jacker. A ball-buster. I put myself in a new frame of mind: Don‚Äôt take him too seriously, don‚Äôt be afraid of him, and try not to lose your cool.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat brought you here?‚Äù I asked.

¬†

He shook his head, ‚ÄúChrist, Cole. You want my life story?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell if we‚Äôre going to be working together...‚Äù

¬†

He laughed, ‚ÄúWe ain‚Äôt gonna be working together for long, trust me.‚Äù

¬†

I stopped talking. I guess he was content with the tension for now.

¬†

We arrived at a modest two story house which I could only assume belonged to the mother.

¬†

‚ÄúJust hang back and don‚Äôt talk. Hopefully we put this all to bed now.‚Äù Gray said as he knocked on the front door.

¬†

The door opened to a middle aged woman. Likely late 40s or early 50s. She was well put together, despite being a bit dishevelled. A look of deep concern was written on her face.

¬†

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù She spoke, cutting to the chase. ‚ÄúAny news?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHow are ya, Miss Lavoy?‚Äù Gray greeted, with a far less rough tone than I had experienced to this point.

¬†

Miss Lavoy walked away from the door, an unspoken invitation to let ourselves in.

¬†

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù She asked, pointing at me.

¬†

‚ÄúNew kid. Showin‚Äô her the ropes and all.‚Äù Gray responded. Another subtle way of taking the piss I figured. I guess I had to get used to this.

¬†

‚ÄúGreat. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve over here training people while my daughter‚Äôs missing.‚Äù Miss Lavoy admonished.

¬†

‚ÄúCome on Miss Lavoy, you know I take this seriously, but you gotta give me somethin‚Äô here. Make it make sense to me. Harmony‚Äôs in Paris. You know that. I know that. She‚Äôs not missing. You want her to come home, I get that, but what would you have me do, fly to Paris and grab her?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs NOT in Paris!‚Äù Miss Lavoy shouted.

¬†

Gray pulled out his phone, pulled up a video, and showed it to her.

¬†

‚ÄúShe posted this TODAY. She‚Äôs been posting all week. Look. Freaking Eiffel Tower‚Äôs in the background. Why do you think she isn‚Äôt there?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWell maybe she is, but she doesn‚Äôt want to be. There‚Äôs just... Something‚Äôs wrong! You don‚Äôt get it! I can‚Äôt... You‚Äôre not her mother, you don‚Äôt know her.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhen was the last time you spoke to your daughter?‚Äù I piped in. Gray shot me a look but didn‚Äôt say anything.

¬†

‚ÄúLast time we spoke on the phone was a few days ago. It‚Äôs mostly texting with her.‚Äù

¬†

My interest was piquing. In what way could she be missing if she could take phone calls, return texts, and post vlogs? It sounded crazy but this woman didn‚Äôt seem crazy. Distressed, very much so, but not crazy.

¬†

‚ÄúAnd in these interactions, did you notice anything strange?‚Äù I prodded.

¬†

‚ÄúWell every time I‚Äôve phoned her she hasn‚Äôt been able to talk long. She always says she‚Äôs busy and she ends the call quick. I call her later and she says she‚Äôs too tired. There‚Äôs always an excuse.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAnd the texts?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just... normal. She tells me not to worry. She brushes it off, says it‚Äôs all fine.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo what exactly makes you think something‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI just know! This whole trip was wrong. She never mentioned it to me until a few days before she left, and even then it was by text. I talked to her friends and they said the same thing. Nobody knew about this trip. It came out of nowhere. Then ever since she left it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not even her mother anymore. She acts like I‚Äôm just another person. She tells me about where she goes and what she does ‚Äì this restaurant, that restaurant, whatever ‚Äì but it‚Äôs all just... nothing.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYou think she‚Äôs hiding something?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúShe wouldn‚Äôt hide anything from me. That‚Äôs not the kind of person she is. This isn‚Äôt her. Whoever‚Äôs in those videos isn‚Äôt her.‚Äù

¬†

Gray stepped back into the conversation, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we try calling her now, huh? We can all hash this out.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah! I‚Äôll call her up now, put her on speaker.‚Äù Miss Lavoy responded, pulling out her phone and dialing.

¬†

It rang and rang and there was no answer. She frowned as we looked on expectantly.

¬†

‚ÄúHang on let me try again.‚Äù

¬†

This time after a few rings, someone picked up.

¬†

‚ÄúHey mom.‚Äù A young woman‚Äôs voice answered.

¬†

‚ÄúHey sweetheart, are you alone right now?‚Äù Miss Lavoy asked.

¬†

‚ÄúUh, yeah, but I‚Äôm actually just about to-‚Äú

¬†

‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôve got some detectives with me here, and I need you to tell us what‚Äôs going on, alright sweetie?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat... What are you...‚Äù The voice on the phone stammered with embarrassment.

¬†

‚ÄúHey there Harmony.‚Äù Gray spoke into the phone. ‚ÄúListen, your mother‚Äôs worried about you and we just wanna make sure everything‚Äôs good over there, alright?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh my gosh...‚Äù Harmony exclaimed with irritation. ‚ÄúMom I told you everything‚Äôs fine! I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre so worried about! I promise I‚Äôm more than okay. I know I extended the trip, but I just wasn‚Äôt ready to leave yet! I‚Äôll be home in just a few more days.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHarmony, are you sure nothing‚Äôs wrong? You have nothing to tell us?‚Äù I prodded.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry about this. I promise there is nothing going on. I just wanted to go on a trip and see the world. My online business kind of took off so I got some money and it just felt like the right time. I‚Äôve never left Nova Scotia before so it was a big step... Look I‚Äôm sorry, I gotta go. Is there anything else I can help you with?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo, that won‚Äôt be necessary, thank you.‚Äù I answered.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you soon, okay mom? I love you.‚Äù Harmony said before hanging up the phone.

¬†

Gray shrugged and threw up his hands, ‚ÄúSo... She seems perfectly alright to me. You‚Äôre worried about your kid being far away from home, I get it. But everything seems fine here. There‚Äôs nothing for us to do.‚Äù

¬†

Miss Lavoy just sighed deeply and shook her head. She was clearly trying to articulate some kind of protest but couldn‚Äôt find the words. Unfortunately for her, Gray was right. There was nothing for us to do. We left shortly after.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat did I say about not talking?‚Äù Gray said as we walked back to the car. I had a feeling he would be sour about that.

¬†

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù I remarked, not hiding my insincerity.

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, yeah. First day, already not taking orders. Good shit.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt aware you were my superior.‚Äù I snipped. My impulses got the better of me.

¬†

Gray laughed. ‚ÄúAre you always this charming?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThat depends, are you always a moody prick?‚Äù I may have overstepped.

¬†

Gray smiled through gritted teeth, ‚ÄúLet me let you in on a little secret, Cole. You know why you‚Äôre partnered with me? It aint cause we‚Äôre both ‚Äúcity folk.‚Äù It‚Äôs cause they don‚Äôt want you here. You can have your guess as to why that is, but that‚Äôs the fact. The sooner you figure that out and just quit, the better it‚Äôll be for both of us.‚Äù

¬†

I suspected he was probably right about that. But it changed nothing.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not quitting.‚Äù I answered, getting into the passenger seat of his car.

¬†

Gray got in the driver‚Äôs seat and shot me a ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see‚Äù look.

¬†

‚ÄúYou may want to reflect on why they thought making you someone‚Äôs partner would be the best way to make them quit.‚Äù I added.

¬†

‚ÄúOh I know why.‚Äù Gray answered. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm a moody prick.‚Äù

¬†

The rest of the day was uneventful and more than mildly unpleasant, but I felt better having had that little spat with Gray. At least we each knew where we stood. I got home to my dark basement apartment, relieved to be done with it for now.

¬†

Yet, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the case. It was essentially closed after today, even though it had barely been open, but still it nagged at me. I had questions. I wanted to know more, I wanted to see more.

¬†

I unpacked my laptop and sat on my bed. I pulled up all of Harmony‚Äôs online profiles just to see if I could find anything. I wasn‚Äôt the most social media savvy person in the world, but I had to have a look.

¬†

The first thing that jumped out at me was the number of followers. Gray wasn‚Äôt kidding when he said she had a big following. She was in the high tens of thousands, encroaching upon the hundred. For a small town Canadian girl, that must have been quite impressive.

¬†

On the phone she mentioned an online business. I had a feeling of what that meant based on how awkwardly she said it in the presence of her mother. Her public profiles made no mention of it, but a minute amount of sleuthing led me to alternate profiles. Instantly adorned in racier photos. Links in the description to various Not Safe For Work subscription services. Pinned posts detailing the content she offered. Fair play to her. I wondered how she broached the subject with her mom. Her mom seems a more uptight and conservative type. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me one bit if she kept this side of her a secret.

¬†

My new initial thought was that this Paris trip wasn‚Äôt just a vacation and it was instead some kind of collaboration. She networked with other NSFW creators, and went down there to make more content for her fans. That explains the shifty behavior, she obviously didn‚Äôt want her mother to know. That all adds up. Case closed.

¬†

But I wanted to try one more thing. Just to dot the I‚Äôs and cross the t‚Äôs. Directly compare a vlog from Paris with one made before. See if there were any discrepancies in her behavior or anything else that might indicate some kind of change. I chose the first vlog from Paris, and a random one from a month earlier with a similar thumbnail.

¬†

To my naked eye, the videos themselves looked innocuous enough. Her mood and attitude appeared the same. I moved to the descriptions and they were both formatted similarly. She replied to a few comments and spoke the same way on each. Similar verbiage, use of punctuation (she likes using double hyphens and the letter u instead of you) it all seemed to check out. Location services confirmed Paris as the location of the post, as if my eyes weren‚Äôt enough to see. It was airtight.

¬†

I went through a few more of her videos, at this point just because I had nothing better to do. It was all relatively the same. Talking to the camera. Sightseeing. Standard stuff. She spent one of the nights in Belgium, that was mildly eventful I suppose.

¬†

Videos before the trip were similarly standard. Some unboxing videos, some trends, some general vlogs. It wasn‚Äôt really my scene, but I could see why people liked it. There was a coziness to it. The crude comments gave me some insight into the ulterior appeal of it as well. She was, after all, very pretty. I was a bit envious of her blue eyes. They were very bright blue and piercing, almost hypnotic. Mine were closer to her mother‚Äôs, a dark greenish hazel.

¬†

Harmony seemed like a happy person. Always smiling, always chipper. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel it was a bit hollow. Which I can understand, it‚Äôs a social media persona. You play it up for the fans. Though there was a sincerity in her older videos that I felt was lacking in the Paris ones. Maybe the passion wasn‚Äôt there anymore, who knows.

¬†

All I knew was it was time for me to go to bed. This case was closed. It was time to empty my mind of it and prepare for the next thing Gray would drag me to.

¬†

The second day on the job in Greenwood went by monotonously. The case load in Toronto versus the case load here couldn‚Äôt have been more different. In Toronto we had plenty of local police to handle the small things so we could focus on the multitude of larger, more dangerous issues. Greenwood only had us, but also Greenwood only had about 5,000 people. Even including nearby counties like Coldbrook and Kingston which we dealt with, it didn‚Äôt come out to a fraction of downtown.

¬†

Gray wasn‚Äôt much less unpleasant this day either. He gave me shit about just about everything. I worked on remaining stoic to the best of my power. I wasn‚Äôt sure if he hated me, if it amused him trying to get a rise out of me, if he was trying to make me quit, or if it was just his personality. Either way, I would ignore it and carry on with the mundanity.

¬†

It wasn‚Äôt until the day after that something else noteworthy happened. More than noteworthy, in fact. It was still early in the morning. A call came in about a disturbance at the local soup kitchen. They said a homeless man was causing a scene. Raving and ranting, and waving a knife around. Gray and I were close, dealing with a petty larceny ‚Äì far below my pay grade, but such is the job. We went to the scene.

¬†

‚ÄúBlessings‚Äù was written in blue italics on a white banner hanging on the front of a rickety little building that was also painted white. There were crosses on the windows. It looked like a house or a small school that had been refurbished and repurposed. Such was the case for many places around here.

¬†

The shouting was audible from outside, as were the sounds of metal clattering. We made our way inside swiftly.

¬†

A raggedy older man stood with his back to the near corner of the cafeteria seating. He held a butcher‚Äôs knife out at arm‚Äôs length, god knows how he got it, while the terrified volunteer staff circled him from a distance with their palms out, attempting to show that they mean him no harm. His eyes were bloodshot and bugged out. He was screaming nonsense.

¬†

Gray and I took control of the room. I stepped out in front of the staff while Gray backed them off. I looked the man in his bulging eyes, attempting to decipher his words before offering my own.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in me! It‚Äôs in me! They poison me!‚Äù He screamed.

¬†

‚ÄúSir, I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs poisoning you. Let‚Äôs put down the knife, okay? Let‚Äôs talk.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNO! They want me to do it, but I won‚Äôt do it! No more! It‚Äôs the bees stinging my brain! They all serve the queen! I won‚Äôt be their bee! They can sting and sting! They can suck the pollen out! They can eat me like a bug, but I won‚Äôt! No more poison! Burn it all! Melt it all!‚Äù

¬†

I‚Äôve heard some insane rambling in my time but that was up there. I needed him to calm down.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù I shouted through his babbling.

¬†

‚ÄúMy... My name? You want my name!? Why!?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBecause I want to talk. That‚Äôs all. Just talk. What‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... It‚Äôs Melvin.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOkay, Melvin. My name is Daria. Now I need you to take a breath. You don‚Äôt want to hurt anybody, do you?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo... No... I don‚Äôt want to hurt anybody.‚Äù He said shakily. I took one slow step towards him and he allowed it without protest.

¬†

‚ÄúGood. So just give me the knife, and we can figure this out. I can‚Äôt help you if you‚Äôre pointing a knife at me, you understand?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not me... it‚Äôs them! It‚Äôs everyone! Soon it‚Äôll be everyone! Melting in the dark! I see it! I see the horns of Satan himself, but it‚Äôs a lie!‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMelvin, deep breath.‚Äù I instructed. ‚ÄúI want to help you but, see, I‚Äôm new here. I‚Äôm from the city. So I don‚Äôt know what you mean when you say these things. Can you just hand me the knife and then explain everything to me calmly?‚Äù

¬†

Melvin didn‚Äôt budge, but his hand shook and he began to sob. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand... An eye for an eye... The window is open... The father...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAnd the girl... she‚Äôs not missing.‚Äù

¬†

Those words caught my attention for some reason. They were too specific. Too directed.

¬†

‚ÄúThe girl?‚Äù I asked.

¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not missing... but she‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWho? What do you mean?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOne eye missing, one eye gone. One eye open, two eyes closed, third eye open. Melting, melting, melting, melting...‚Äù He raved in manic whispers.

¬†

‚ÄúMelvin...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt be me. Won‚Äôt be me. Pluck it out. Stop the sting. Drink, drink, drink. He‚Äôs coming here, I‚Äôll go there. He‚Äôll walk again, but not in skin. Never skin. The holes don‚Äôt have eyes but they will. They will be his not hers. Hers will be missing but she will be gone. Gone from her skin. Lost in her eye.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMelvin, look at me.‚Äù I said, taking another slow step forward.

¬†

Melvin did as I asked and stared into my eyes. He took a deep breath and uttered ‚ÄúI now belong to Candle Caine.‚Äù

¬†

In one frantic motion, he turned the knife to his own throat and closed his eyes tight.

¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt!‚Äù I shouted as I sprinted towards him, but it was too late.

¬†

He plunged the knife into his throat. Instantly blood poured and belched out from the wound. I did what I could, but it was in deep. All the way to the hilt. He shook, convulsed, and gurgled. Then he was gone, and it was quiet. The worst kind of quiet.

¬†

The ambulance came and took his body. Gray and I stuck around to take care of the traumatized patrons and staff. A man came up and introduced himself as the owner, Mr. Ray Whitley. An older, gangly sort of man with a wisp of white hair. We questioned him briefly.

¬†

‚ÄúDid Melvin come around here often?‚Äù Gray asked.

¬†

‚ÄúYeah... Yeah he did, he was one of our regulars. Never seen him act like... I mean... I don‚Äôt know...‚Äù Whitley said, in a somber shellshock.

¬†

‚ÄúDid you know much about him? Did he have family here or anything?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHe used to always talk about his niece, Annabelle... I don‚Äôt think she lived around here though. He didn‚Äôt like to talk about himself much. I imagine he just fell on hard times. It‚Äôs rough out there, you know?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOh, that I know. For sure. I mean, shit, I wish I had a place like this back in the day.‚Äù Gray remarked, probably trying to quell the dread.

¬†

‚ÄúWell... It‚Äôs just Nova Scotia hospitality I guess.‚Äù Whitley responded humbly.

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, New York hospitality is a little different... But for real, I admire what you do, lookin‚Äô out for people. You take care now. Call if anything else comes to mind.‚Äù

¬†

Gray definitely had a way with people. A charm, and a disarming sort of charisma. So antithetical to the asshole he usually was.

¬†

We stepped outside and took in some air. The silence lingered for a while before he spoke.

¬†

‚ÄúFirst time seeing someone die?‚Äù He asked.

¬†

‚ÄúNo...‚Äù I answered.

¬†

‚ÄúWell... You did alright, kid. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up.‚Äù

¬†

The word ‚Äòkid‚Äô aside, that was by far the nicest thing he said to me thus far.

¬†

‚ÄúThe way he was acting... The things he said...‚Äù I thought out loud.

¬†

‚ÄúFucking nuts.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah but... I‚Äôve seen manic episodes, schizophrenia, delusions, bad trips... I‚Äôve dealt with lots of those in Toronto. This felt different... And what is Candle Caine? Have you ever heard of that?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúNo idea. Sounds like a high school mascot or somethin‚Äô... Maybe he was trying to say ‚Äòcandy cane‚Äô...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt really make sense in context though...‚Äù

¬†

Gray dismissively snorted, ‚ÄúWhat fucking context, Cole? The man was out of it. He was gone. He stuck a knife in his jugular, that‚Äôs the context.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs it? You don‚Äôt even want to look into it? You don‚Äôt wanna do your job?‚Äù I snipped.

¬†

‚ÄúOh fuck off. We‚Äôll look into it. I‚Äôm just sayin‚Äô... You know last month there was a graverobbing over in Meadowvale. Just a random, old, unmarked grave. They still don‚Äôt know who did it or why, they don‚Äôt know dick all. Last I checked they didn‚Äôt even know who the fuck the grave belonged to. All they know is some freak dug up a skeleton.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOkay, why are you telling me this?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúBecause sometimes people do weird shit. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt make sense and it never will and we just have to be okay with that. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt do your job, I‚Äôm just saying be prepared to not tie it all in a fucking bow.‚Äù Gray explained.

¬†

I rolled my eyes. To me it just sounded like laziness.

¬†

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù A frail and solemn voice called out from down the sidewalk. Another scruffy looking man with an overgrown beard approached us, visibly a few years younger. ‚ÄúFran told me what happened to Melvin, I was just on my way here... You‚Äôre the cops? You saw it all?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah...‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúDid you know him?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWe... We played cribbage... Nobody else knew how to play. They call it an old person game... He won almost every time. I beat him one time, just one... He was my friend...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt have... He wasn‚Äôt... Ugh... He was saving up. He was gonna buy his niece a gift for her 7th birthday. I kept tellin‚Äô him ‚Äúyou use that money for yourself, you idiot.‚Äù But he was so excited, he was clean, it was the first birthday of her life he could actually buy her something... He wouldn‚Äôt just...‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúHe sounds like he was a good man...‚Äù I said. It was hard to stifle my heartache upon hearing that.

¬†

‚ÄúHe was... I‚Äôm sorry... Are you okay?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúMe? Yeah. Yeah I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù I said, taken slightly aback by the man‚Äôs consideration. ‚ÄúAre you?‚Äù

¬†

The man let out a deep sigh. ‚ÄúYeah... It just don‚Äôt make sense...‚Äù

¬†

He was right... it didn‚Äôt. He walked away, his head hung. I felt for him. This part is never easy. You always wish for the right sequence of words to make it a little bit better, but most of the time no such words exist. You just have to watch as peoples‚Äô worlds crumble, and try to feel secure on the knowledge that you did all you could, even if your brain constantly tells you otherwise.

¬†

There was a constant urge to dehumanize tragedy, to make it easier to manage. It helps with the job, and it helps life in general not be so crushing. But sometimes the humanity of it all just smacks you in the face. Today was one of those days. Gray and I left shortly after, but I couldn‚Äôt get it out of my head. Any of it.

1k8vvif,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8vvif,COFFEE AND AGAR RECIPE,"**This is a new recipe that I am confident will take off. Use if you would like and share for the love.**


**Equipment**


Pressure Cooker at 15psi

Steamer Basket 

Microwavable Silicone mat

A handeled cooking pot

Measuring cup

Measuring spoons

A stove top

PP5 plastic ketchup cups (link for them at the bottom of the page) or Petri Dishes and a SAB or Flow Hood 

Heavy Duty Tin Foil 


**Ingredients**

900mls of Distilled Water

100mls of coffee (I used Costco French Roast)

30grams of PDA agar powder (use LME or Agar Agar flakes if you prefer) 

40mls of Light Karo Corn Syrup

15mls of Erythritol 

15mls of Organic Honey

A pinch of Gypsum (or if you want an elevated pH a pinch of Lime)

So first and foremost set up your Pressure Cooker with a steamer basket if you have one and fill the water up underneath it and place a microwavable Silicone mat on top of it. The cups need to elevated out of the water. I put a splash of white vinegar into the water to prevent to much sediment sticking to the pressure cooker. Turn the stove on high but do not close the lid, leave it loosely on. Start placing your 50-65 cups or plates if you're using a whole liter for easy pouring. 

Now let's make the agar. 

Pour in 900mls of Distilled water and 100mls of coffee into your pot. Place it on the stove and start on medium heat. Next add in your 30 grams of Agar of your choice and stir. Measure out 40mls of Light Karo Corn Syrup and dump it in and continue stirring. Next add in 15mls if Erythritol which is a tablespoon and stir. Now pour 15mls of organic honey onto the same spoon and stir. (It should be hot enough to pull the honey off the spoon so you can dip it into the mix to get it all off). Last ingredient is up to you if you want to spike or buffer the pH balance. A pinch of gypsum to buffer the pH and a pinch of dehydrated lime to spike the pH. Mix everything together until it's 190¬∞ and pull it off and start pouring into your ketchup cups. 

[or if your using plates do it in front of your flow hood rapidly and seal them all before the temperature drops below 180¬∞ or in a SAB]

Next we need to put our lids on our ketchup cups and wrap them in tin foil like shown in the photos. 

Now your pressure cooker should be hot and be ready to go so take the lid off **again it's very important not to tighten the lid so it can't blow off while you're preheating your PC to save 5-10 minutes while it's heating up to easily pour and place them in your PC** and place your cups stacked in 3's evenly distributed throughout your pressure cooker. Once your PC reaches 15psi pressure cook for 20 minutes **add 5 minutes per thousand feet you live above sea level. If you live at 10,000ft still only at 45 minutes. And max at 45 additional minutes**

Allow your PC to depressurize naturally and then take off the lid. The tin foil should not be very hot because foil doesn't get hot but use a glove to be safe. And now you can start grabbing out the stacks of three and setting them level on the counter. They will congeal/harden and be ready within 20 minutes so you want to have them level so they don't congeal/harden crooked or at an angle.

Pat yourself on the back!!! You just made agar plates without needing a to worry about contamination because they are sealed unlike Petri Dishes. I prefer easily sealing my agar dishes and never having to worry about them being contaminated. These can be used right away so no more waiting to see if you did everything with perfect sterility.

1k8vvb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeOfStyrofoam/comments/1k8vvb6/i_dont_think_cutting_is_cute_or_acceptable_rant/,i don't think cutting is cute or acceptable (RANT) + mixed feelings on this subreddit . . .,"There was a time when looking into this subreddit felt more like a community of people who cut and harmed themselves (yes, cut - not """"yeet"""") and still tried to get better.

But lately every post is a variant of something awful (and imo juvenile). THROW AWAY YOUR BLADES. STOP BUYING BLADES. Guess what, I used to feel addicted too. But doing this stuff to hurt yourself is not okay. 

I started cutting in middle school. I should have been making friends and happy memories.

It shouldn't be accepted. And I feel like there are those in this sub that inadvertently proliferate the idea that cutting is okay. We're not ""foamies."" We're not ""yeeters."" WE ARE HURTING OURSELVES TO ESCAPE A PAIN WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND. And yeah if you feel shame about it, then you should. I have to wear long sleeves everywhere, just not to disturb people. And yeah, of flipping, freakin', fucking course I'm ashamed. My nephews aren't idiots, and even at the young age that they're at, they've started to ask why did I cut myself. I feel an infinite amount of regret for what I've done to myself. . . 

AND I SHOULD. Tearing into your skin is a serious sign of mental malfunction, and no amount of ILYs or ""eggs"" from the automod will ever change my newly founded opinion on that.

I haven't hurt myself in a long time. A LONG TIME. I haven't kept track of it, I just know THAT I'M DONE HURTING MYSELF. I'll occasionally be cooking and have to use a knife, and I remember  all the nights where I felt so alone, and would wake up to bedsheets soaked with blood. And I don't feel proud for overcoming this - I just accept that there used to be days where things got so bad that hurting myself was the only thing that made sense. And then I move on and finish my meal and go through the rest of the day.

The best thing I ever did was throw out my razor blades. I didn't read books on self-improvement. And I barely even care to take care of myself every morning. I don't AT ALL disparage anyone who had to seek outside resources to overcome this. You're far braver and stronger than I am for doing so.

I strongly suggest everyone here do the same. Seriously. Throw away your razor blades, and knives, and scissors RIGHT NOW. put them in your neighbor's trash can,  burn them in a bonfire, mail them halfway to Siberia, who cares - JUST GET RID OF THEM. Tell someone you trust to get rid of them for you. I'm extremely privileged that I have people around me to keep me safe and grounded. I completely understand that. But what about personal choice and free will? You can read this and feel angry or offended, but YOU brought those blades into YOUR space. The same way you did that - the same way you can throw them out.

And I'm not perfect. I don't drink anything that I consider dangerous (not even coffee or tea), like a fucking weenie, and I don't put anymore stupid, dipshit chemicals into my lungs or body . . . but I also haven't been to therapy in a good while. Every night I have terrible dreams where I do horrific things to both the people I love and complete strangers. I don't take any meds that I KNOW WOULD HELP ME. I'm just a mess, and getting access to psychiatric/therapeutic help is almost dang-diddly impossible where I live. I know that based on so many of the posts here, there are a multitude of people experiencing the same.

Honestly, I just have mixed feelings about this community. I hope you can read through this and understand, instead of hitting that easy trigger finger towards the down vote button.

You can look at my profile. I really don't mind. I used to address everyone as ""foamies"" and use all the different cutesy innuendos that exist in this sub  . . . but honestly ? I'm tired of it. All those old posts sicken me. I want to die every day (not ""unalive"" or ""teminate"" or any other dumb, brainrot version of the term). My first thought every morning is regretting that I have to wake up again. I don't want to exist. And telling you that I'm trying my best to fight this would be a lie.

Cutting isn't cute. It's not something to be accepted. Cutting yourself is cruel. Do you even understand how beautiful you are? Because it's true. Everyone here is much stronger than they think they are. 

It's self-inflicted abuse. The world is such a beautiful, hopeful, amazing place. And maybe I am a hypocrite for looking up every morning / night to admire it, and still wanting to go to a hardware store and buy some rope. I don't care. I'm staying alive, and I refuse to hurt myself any further for the simple reason of just not doing it. My inversion to self-harm doesn't exist for some noble reason, I just don't do it, because tearing into my skin, or drinking, or smoking, or popping pills is something I'm tired of. It's all so boring and banal and played out.

My ultimate hope is that one day, this sub is completely empty.",0,1745728885.0,MadeOfStyrofoam,10,0.36,False

1k8vt1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ResourceAmazing5438/comments/1k8vt1x/abby_a_race_for_a_friend/,‚ÄòAbby‚Äô A Race For A Friend,"As the sun light glistened across a 1940‚Äôs Indianapolis race track, the mornings mist had long since lifted. Revealing a track full of cars, cars that were being worked on, ahead of the race ahead. A race that meant so much to so many drivers, but one particular driver among them.

His name was Bobby‚Äô standing there by his car with his brown brushed back hair, having a James Dean look about him. But that wasn‚Äôt what attracted Abby‚Äô to him, it was his ambitions for racing and winning. Thinking back to the days of both of them hanging out at the corner cafe. 

As the people would soon gather there standing at and around the tables with their spirits high! As the coffee would brew, with plenty of food and talk all around. For in the cafe everybody knew everyone! Even the ones from out of town that was there for the race, it was the atmosphere at the time. When you could just stop and talk for bit, while enjoying some good food and the excitement that was to come. 

As Abby‚Äô setting there with Bobby‚Äô and the rest of the guys from the racing world, setting there looking out into a 1940‚Äôs Indianapolis street. Seeing as the cars of old would pass by, a world much different than what would be the world that Abby‚Äô knew. 

From centuries ago Abby‚Äô with every chance that she got, would find herself watching the races in a time when men would race in chariots. From an era when Rome was the center of the known world. Finding herself Watching the many of the chariot races from a top of the Colosseum of Ancient Rome from long ago. Never herself having raced in one of the chariot races, but often outside of the city she often race in a chariot. 

Racing outside of the city of Rome occasionally finding herself being raced by a group of soldiers. Some racing with her! Some not so much, but always stopping to watch a setting sun. As it would shine its light through the Colosseum out into the city around it. 

Finding herself back in the cafe seeing Bobby‚Äô and the rest of the guys talking about their cars. Seeing Bobby‚Äô setting there cool as to be to everyone around him. Never wanting to settle for second best! Even with me. For love we had for each other was not only a completing one! But always trying to find the best of ourselves while at the same time. 

Finding ourselves holding one another closely settling up underneath a starlit sky above us. Something that both had in common with one another, not wanting to lose to the other, but at the same time loving finding love with each other. For Abby‚Äôs drive and determination to win, also at times clashed with Bobby‚Äôs need to win. But respect for the other they both had, for the many times that they both walked from one other after a race. 

Only to find each other again learning from the other, for the need to win was always there. But the moments that they had was always! and would as such for the love that they both shared for racing was just as strong as it was for each other. As the crowd was slowly beginning to come into the stands for the race. 

Anticipation was high among everyone! As Abby leaned stood there by her car, as the breeze was blowing through her long dark hair. She was ready! Ready for the race ahead! A race that both her and Bobby‚Äô had waited for all season, knowing that neither was going to summit to the other. With the crowd now at their feet as both Bobby‚Äô and Abby‚Äô set there in their cars waiting for the race to begin. But unknowingly to Bobby‚Äô at the time, that this race would be the last for Abby‚Äô.

And the last time that he would see her! For soon after, Abby‚Äô would soon take a journey! A journey that would set the stage for one last conflict with her brother. A brother who born just as she was, born of the same Watcher who was also the father of Abby‚Äô. 

Finding herself unknowingly at war or battle because of him, her brother who had took so many whom she had loved from her. Over the centuries! Knowing that she would eventually have to confront him again, knowing what he had done to not only her But so many before.

Making her way to join the war, and leaving racing behind her for now, but not forever. But even unknowingly to Abby‚Äô at the time, was that she was carrying someone! Someone that would be some years later down the road before she would even know. 

For she was carrying Bobby‚Äôs child! For even though Abby‚Äô was immortal! Her own mother had carried her for an entire Generation before Abby‚Äô herself was born. For even though her mother was not immortal! Her father was! Himself being one of the Watchers from the time of Noah‚Äô. 

Leaving Abby‚Äô to be raised by Noah‚Äô and his family, and from there her journey into this Life began. But now as we find ourselves with Abby‚Äô some years later after the war, finding herself at home! As the sun was beginning to fade behind the blue ridge mountains off in the distance. 

Setting there in her solid black 1968 Shelby Cobra GT that she had built Abby‚Äô set there looking out across the open field. Watching the setting sun shine the last of its light down upon the open fields just ahead of me. As Abby‚Äô set there watching her beautiful black stallion midnight‚Äô as he grazed in the open field. 

Gripping her hands tighter onto the steering wheel giving one last look at a picture that was hanging from her visor. A picture of her and Bobby‚Äô at Indy just before a race, it was Only a few times in her life that she would become close to someone in that way. 

Knowing that it would only be for a short time before she would have to give her goodbyes without saying goodbye. Knowing that it hurt more each time having to leave someone for years she had. But time few she had for the people around her, but unknowingly at the time Bobby would be once again in her life. But as not as she would have never even thought possible, for in time Abby‚Äô would give birth to their daughter.

But that is a story for another time finding ourselves back to where we was looking out into the field just as she then started up her car. Hearing the engine come to life, with a roar as she gave it some gas gripping her steering wheel tight giving one quick look to her beautiful Midnight. 

As she then gave a shout to Midnight‚Äô as he then turned Looking to Abby‚Äô rearing his front legs high into the air. And with a smile Abby took off with a cloud of dust behind her making her way down the dirt road along the fence line. Midnight was there running in the field along with Abbys Shelby Gt. 

With the wind blowing in through the front window blowing through her long dark hair. She then gave one last look and smile over to Midnight‚Äô as she then stomped the gas making her way down the dirt road a dirt road that was connected to her land in the blue ridge. 

As Midnight became smaller in her rear view mirror racing down the road as the sun disappeared behind the mountains in the distance. It was a road that Abby knew well, well enough she could race on it at night without any headlights on. For Abby would often race on it just to bring back the memories of her racing days. 

Days that meant everything to her when she was with the people that she cared for very much in life. With the people that would forever be in her memories even when everyone that you knew around you was gone. Her memories would always be there to help keep her going pulling up into her driveway making her way to her barn. Slowly getting out of her car looking up at the stars above her. 

Knowing that Handel‚Äô was up there somewhere looking down to her always looking to Abby‚Äô wherever her journey would lead. Seeing the stars as they shot across the night‚Äôs sky Abby‚Äô would often think back to the times when she would be on top of Annapurna. Looking up into an endless starlit sky! Looking up into the Heavens above her. 

For many nights she would set a top of Annapurna‚Äô looking up into the stars above her waiting the morning sun to rise. It was her place to go to think, to get answers for some answers to the question that she sought. Would sometimes not finding the true meaning of what she was told until at times years later. Helping her to become the person that she was now, helping and passing on knowledge to others along the way.

For Annapurna was the only thing left of what used to be her home! Her home before the flood. A place, a land that once was a lush endless landscape of all living things. For it very much reminded her of her home today there in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Before the flood of man changed everything that once was! 

Seeing how the world around her had changed over the centuries, seeing and learning new cultures. Some long gone, and some still hidden away within the land that is now. Seeing the towers of old! Become the towers of what is today. For man has always built to reach the Heavens above!  As memories began to flood back to her during her in the time of Babel. For many occasions finding herself racing horses across its desert landscape. A landscape that was once very different, for the flood had changed everything! The world that once was, the world in which Abby‚Äô was born. Never again to be. 

For that was when she had also met her first love, Nineveh‚Äô a rare blue grayish eyed dark haired and in tone. for a love a not only horses they shared. But racing them as well! Finding themselves racing others many times across the ancient lands of Babel‚Äô. Spending a many of nights sleeping up underneath a starlit sky above them. Holding one another close watching not only the stars shoot across the sky, but would also look at each other. 

For on some occasions Abby‚Äô would teach and show Nineveh‚Äô the star constellations, and what each one ment. For that was one of many things Handel‚Äô had taught her about the Heavens above them. For on some very rare occasions one could see a shooting star, thinking to themselves a shooting star. But a shooting star it was not always for on rare occasions one may see a Heavenly Angel as it flys across a starlit filled sky. But that was a realm the even Abby‚Äô could not venture to herself, for even if you was above high the earth. The realm itself was invisible to the eyes of man. For the even though desert landscape around ancient Babel was very much different from the time of Noah. 

It still had many treasures hidden from within it, and on many occasions Abby‚Äô and Nineveh‚Äô would spend many of a days. Looking and finding its treasures that the land had with in it. Riding horses into a sunset sky with the Ancient Tower of Babel‚Äô shining from its light. But that was Before her brother, a brother who was going to bring a lot of hurt and loss to her along her journey. But at the time with her unknowing to the Days to that was to come.

But one thing seemed to remain in every century in every culture, and that was a need for racing in one way or another. Whether it be on foot or by horseback, or on sheep‚Äôs back! Yes even sheep! For the world that we know now, was not the world of yesterday. For racing has always been! For the need to compete with one another has and will always be till the end of every that we all know. 

Leaning there up against her car as the memories would flood back to her memories of a distant life‚Äôs. Finding herself racing horses through the ancient lands of yesterday! To the lands of where the people of yesterday would become the people of today. For she would often think to herself why was she born this way! why her! To live a life was to grow old with the ones that we loved. For people often dream of having an Immortal life but when you live an Immortal life. You only live to see time as it goes by leaving you with only the memories of the people around you.

Wiping away a tear from her eye as she then walked over to the barn looking up seeing Miranda her adoptive daughter setting there on the front porch. Giving her a wave knowing that her time with Miranda would be over all too soon. For it was a little over 60 years since she had brought Miranda home from the War. Like so many orphaned to the world around her from a world that orphaned her. Waking into the barn flipping on a light Abby‚Äô stood there looking into a mirror, seeing herself not as she was now. But looking at a samurai with her long dark hair flowing in and around her eyes. Holding onto a sword that was made specifically for her, a sword that bared her name from long ago Ena‚Äô.

For centuries have long since passed from a time that meant so much to her, memories that will forever remain with her. Memories of a love that has long since been gone, standing there seeing an image of a person that she once was. But now with her brother gone defeated! That person she was looking at in the mirror will be soon gone as well.

But for now the memories will forever be with her. Looking away from the mirror looking over at an Indy car that she once raced in. Seeing her race trophy‚Äôs that aligned the wall But one trophy stood out a trophy that meant just as much to her as her Indy win. And that was her Daytona 500 trophy! 

For after the War! After her brother! Abby never went back to full time racing. But It was not until about twenty five years later that she would first meet Harry‚Äô his friends gave him the nickname of Harry‚Äô but to Abby‚Äô he was little bear to her! A nick name she had given him a fitting nickname for a man who was over six feet tall with a build like a bear. Also being of Native American mix‚Äô he didn‚Äôt really have any family growing up with racing being his family. Until he met her met Abby‚Äô who would kinda become a daughter to him. Even though she was six thousand years old! 

As Abby‚Äô stood there looking at a Daytona 500 trophy, along with a picture hanging there of little bear and her race crew. With Abby thinking back to when she had first met little bear there at a local track where she would also meet the other guys. Guys that would soon become a family to her! For they would travel together to different local race tracks laughing and just enjoy life along the way. 

For in her many journeys Abby‚Äô always knew that the moment would always be a memory as long as she would be. As long as the stars remained in the sky above! Abby‚Äô would have the many memories of her journeys of the world now! And of her world from long ago.

As everyone got to know each other they would grow not just like a race team would grow! But as a family would grow! Racing at different events along the way always looking out for one another. With little bear even being a father figure to everyone! Even to an immortal! 

For Abby‚Äô would often find herself talking with little bear, listening to him talk about the racers of then. For even though Abby‚Äô was a racer of old! It was always nice to set there and listen to stories of others! 

For Abby‚Äô had stories! Many stories but she had to always remind herself before she would talk! For you just couldn‚Äôt just tell anyone about your adventures from hundreds of years ago! 

But listen she would always. Even though they only raced smaller events we were a racing family to each other. A racing family that she hadn‚Äôt had since the early days of racing, but as Abby stood there in the her barn thinking back on her racing family. She remembered the conversation that she once had with little bear, for one night after a race he had told her that ever since he was a little kid he had loved racing. 

Looking up to the legendary drivers of yesterday and today, but as he got older he had always dreamed of racing against those guys. Abby remembered what he had told her that night as they stood there leaning up against the railing. For he was always amazed at Abbys driving abilities and her knowledge of building a race car. 

For he had never seen anybody with such knowledge that Abby had on building and driving cars. But Abby‚Äô knew even though she had been driving and building cars for decades! She was only as good as what she had put into it! 

Even she was Immortal she also had to learn everything just as a human would have to learn. All of the knowledge of everything that she had learned over the centuries. Was taught to her by others around her, from casting and shaping metal into swords! 

From woven silk into clothing, learning traits and skills from many cultures before. But all above she had learned! She was always taught to set and listen! For knowledge was not a given! But what she always strived for. And what made her a good race car driver was not only her knowledge of the sport. But the fact that she had been racing and learning from others around her that made her what and who she was today.

Knowing that they would only be a part of her life for a short time, she knew right then and there. That She would do it for little bear! she would win him the Daytona 500 trophy. For over the next few weeks her and little bear along with the rest of the guys would build a car together. a car that would win at Daytona! 

For To little bear the trophy would be the world to him. But to Abby‚Äô he was her friend! And together they were going to do it no matter what. For when that day had arrived! Abby‚Äô and little bear and the rest of the guys unloaded the car there at Daytona. For that night Abby‚Äô would find herself setting outside of the track looking up into a starlit sky. Looking to see if Handel might have been watching her! 

Looking as she thought back on there many conversations, conversations on when one would die. Some with all too short of a Life! And others only to know if they was in the Heavens above along with him. Knowing that Handel‚Äô wasn‚Äôt allowed to tell Abby‚Äô for at times she didn‚Äôt understand Life and Death. Being an immortal herself! Knowing that a person‚Äôs Life was sometimes unjust for the times that one would live. 

For often Abby would find herself looking into the Heavens above her thinking of questions as such. For even when her end would come, she would often have Handel there to talk to about said questions. But as the sun was just starting to rise that day the morning the morning mist was still all around the track. With Abby‚Äô walking over to her car she saw little bear setting there on the pit lane wall. Making her way over to him little bear just looked over to Abby saying to her

‚ÄúEvery dream that have ever had I could have never dreamed this moment being here on this race track a race track where legends have raced. But most of all being here with you Abby‚Äô for have helped to make this possible‚Äù 

With Abby‚Äô standing there beside little bear looking up into the grand stands that would soon be full of fans. She would say to little bear

 ‚Äú No we made possible! We as a team you me and all of the guys together‚Äù 

With a smile little bear then looked to Abby saying 

‚Äú Abby you could have been one of the greats! You still can! For I have never seen anyone who can handle a car like you do. So why didn‚Äôt you ever go for it all become a legend of this sport instead of wasting your time with an old washed up man like me‚Äù 

Putting her arm around little bear giving him a smile as she knew in her heart that she was exactly where she wanted to be. As she would say to little bear 

‚ÄúYou could had given me the world over! You could given me every racing trophy ever made! But there is one thing that this world could never give me and that is another you little bear‚Äù 

For to Abby‚Äô little bear was like a father figure not just to her but to all of the guys. Even an Immortal needs someone in their life From time to time. Abby could tell that little bear was nervous as they sat there looking up into the grand stands. But in her own little way she let him know that this day was going to be ours. 

For no one was going to take that from us! Not on this day! This was going to be the day that we came! And we conquered Daytona! Just as the legendary drivers did of the past. And just as Abby told little bear that! They did just that! As Abby would hold up the trophy in victory lane there with little bear and the guys by her side. 

Standing there for a group picture everyone together as little bear put his hand on Abbys shoulder giving her the biggest smile in the world. Just right before the picture was taken that day. 

As Abby‚Äô stood there in the barn wiping away a tear! a smile would come to her for she knew what little bear would have said to her. Just like on many occasions he would say 

‚Äú Abby we may not be in this life forever! We may not win at every race but together you and I we can sure as hell give them hell this day!‚Äù

For it was the last time that Abby and little bear would race together for after that race little bears health would start to decline. With him passing away just a year later. 

As Abby then made her way out of the barn looking up into the nights sky above her she knew that somewhere up there little bear was looking down at her saying to her

‚Äú go get-‚Äôem Abby! This race is yours and I will see you in victory lane here one day‚Äù

thinking to herself I will see you again little bear in victory lane some day when my final race is raced and my day is done I will see you then as well little bear in victory lane.

AHHH its so fucking lonely.

im hitting all these milestones for myself and i have no one to celebrate with or just fucking hang out with. i don‚Äôt even care about celebrating, i just want the company and to socialize. it‚Äôs so fucking weird because i know that im not miserable to talk to and that im fun to be around, but it doesn‚Äôt help. ugh maybe im not and dont even know it- i just dont fucking get it. recently, i‚Äôve found that people will go out of their way to try and hang out with me or make plans with me and then they just never happen or happen without me? ITS SO WEIRDDDD JKSKDKS. like people want to temporarily be around me, but nobody wants to get to know me and be good friends. yeah idk maybe people don‚Äôt like me and that‚Äôs really fucking hard for me to wrap my head around and yanno just really hurts because i try so hard. i‚Äôve spent so much time alone at this point that im so scared it‚Äôs gonna be like this forever. im trying to remind myself it‚Äôs temporary, but oh my god im scared of just becoming more and more independent and just forgetting to need people more. it‚Äôs such a hard feeling to explain. i feel like i could disappear and people just wouldn‚Äôt notice and that fucking HURTSSS. im starting to get anxiety just fucking leaving my apartment atp and it‚Äôs making me spiral so bad, it‚Äôs like i don‚Äôt even want to participate in my life anymore. i want to go home so bad and i just feel so stuck in my situation and in what im doing. im scared im wasting my early 20s and missing all of these experiences bc i dont have my people yet. like this is not at all how i envisioned my life and i cant figure out how to change it and its so exhausting constantly feeling this way and regretting a future that hasn‚Äôt even happened yet. like what do you mean nobody is experiencing getting close to me or getting to know me??? i feel so fucking invisible and i can‚Äôt even picture it getting better in the future anymore ",1,1745728431.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

But for context; My mom and I have been making some switches food wise for health reasons, and my mom who is a habitual coffee drinker, wanted to try hot tea with me. It was never something she really drank before, and never particularly cared for it, but we'd read it had a lower caffeine content and thought it might be a nice alternative to try. I myself do drink coffee, but not to the level of my mom or even some other people I've seen. I usually have a cup in the mornings when I wake up, or in the afternoon if I sleep in due to a shift being later that day instead, but that's about it unless it's a particularly bad day. 

The reason for this is when we tried the hot tea earlier and had a really strange reaction. It was like some weird mix of my blood pressure dropping and my anxiety spiking. I felt hot, and oddly tired, and everything sort of felt like it shifted down, and then I got hit with the anxiety and a bit later it petered out and I was ok. 

I did some googling and I can't seem to find an answer. The tea wasn't anything special, just a store brand bag variety of blueberry pomegranate green tea. I've read some posts from previous posters that it may have been caffeine withdrawal. But that doesn't make sense in this context. We had tried it at almost 9 pm, and by that time I'd only had a single cup of coffee today, and it had been hours before, at around 3 pm. I saw some posts saying not to drink it on an empty stomach. I had finished eating dinner at around 7:30 pm, so it had technically been over an hour of no food before I tried the tea? The weird part is my mom, who was sitting right next to me and drinks more coffee than I do, had almost no reaction to the tea. So I don't know if that means anything in the caffeine withdrawal theory but that happened. 

I know it's probably nothing, but I admit it freaked me out a bit. I'd always heard tea was a safer alternative for helping with anxiety, and I don't know much about it beyond that. I followed the box instructions; 8 fl oz to a rolling boil, let steep for 1-2 minutes. I really don't know what happened, so if anyone has any ideas please let me know.",3,1745728226.0,tea,9,1.0,False

My thing is ability to connect with others (probably ENFP thing) and my introverted friends often hide behind my back leaning on me to take charge in social situations. But today I decided to observe my friend interacting with a barista and once I‚Äôve noticed it I realized most of my friends who feel awkward in social situations do this exact same thing ‚Äî they stay so worried inside their heads that they are completely disconnected with anything that‚Äôs going on around them and other people that take part in it. 

So next time you are in a social situation, I encourage you to take a moment to connect with the place you are in. Imagine you are a gracious, smooth, coordinated panther üêÜ who slowly walks in. You are in no rush, just observing first. 

Let‚Äôs say you came to buy coffee. You walk into a coffee shop and you are assessing the situation with curiosity. Here are people having good time, here is a barista working her shift. This is the reality. The barista is finishing something up. How is she feeling right now? Are her moves agile and lively or is she rather tired and slow? Either way is okay, it‚Äôs her reality. You are not here to change it or make judgments about it, you are simply grounding with what is. She comes up to you and asks you how you are, how does her voice sound? You are looking at her attentively and genuinely asking her ‚Äúhow is your day going?‚Äù and pause..  Your focus brings connection. What else comes up to your attention? Look at her cute shorts, she probably wore them because it‚Äôs hot today. You say ‚ÄúI love your shorts.‚Äù She says ‚Äúthanks, I didn‚Äôt want to be cooking going home today‚Äù This is enough, you don‚Äôt have to say anything else unless you want to, small talk is not about a conversation or an intellectual exchange. It‚Äôs to acknowledge each other presence and tune into the mutual reality ‚Äî our mutual reality for right now is this place, this weather, this coffee and us experiencing it together in the moods that we are in. We can smile gently while looking at each other face and say ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù ‚ÄúI appreciate it.‚Äù ‚ÄúHave a breezy walk home later today.‚Äù

I literally just went to urgent care earlier today because I was scared that my baby and I were being bit by something. They told me that what we had looked viral (her pediatrician said the same) and not like bites from any pests, but then I saw this tonight. 

I‚Äôm so freaked out. I am a single mom, my room isn‚Äôt the cleanest, like I haven‚Äôt shampooed the carpet or dusted in a few months, but I am constantly doing laundry & the only dirty dish in my room is my coffee mug. 

I asked ChatGPT and it said it looks like a carpenter beetle. I do occasionally get those, but this doesn‚Äôt look like one to me, especially the way it squished. 

Could this be a bedbug?? We were at a hospital in the Bronx a couple of weeks ago & stayed at a family member‚Äôs house as well, but idk. We don‚Äôt have the three bites in a row that I saw online when I was looking up stuff.

1k8vjur,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8vjur,PDA & COFFEE AGAR RECIPE,"**This is a new recipe that I am confident will take off. Use if you would like and share for the love.**


**Equipment**


Pressure Cooker at 15psi

Steamer Basket 

Microwavable Silicone mat

A handeled cooking pot

Measuring cup

Measuring spoons

A stove top

PP5 plastic ketchup cups (link for them at the bottom of the page) or Petri Dishes and a SAB or Flow Hood 

Heavy Duty Tin Foil 


**Ingredients**

900mls of Distilled Water

100mls of coffee (I used Costco French Roast)

30grams of PDA agar powder (use LME or Agar Agar flakes if you prefer) 

40mls of Light Karo Corn Syrup

15mls of Erythritol 

15mls of Organic Honey

A pinch of Gypsum (or if you want an elevated pH a pinch of Lime)

So first and foremost set up your Pressure Cooker with a steamer basket if you have one and fill the water up underneath it and place a microwavable Silicone mat on top of it. The cups need to elevated out of the water. I put a splash of white vinegar into the water to prevent to much sediment sticking to the pressure cooker. Turn the stove on high but do not close the lid, leave it loosely on. Start placing your 50-65 cups or plates if you're using a whole liter for easy pouring. 

Now let's make the agar. 

Pour in 900mls of Distilled water and 100mls of coffee into your pot. Place it on the stove and start on medium heat. Next add in your 30 grams of Agar of your choice and stir. Measure out 40mls of Light Karo Corn Syrup and dump it in and continue stirring. Next add in 15mls if Erythritol which is a tablespoon and stir. Now pour 15mls of organic honey onto the same spoon and stir. (It should be hot enough to pull the honey off the spoon so you can dip it into the mix to get it all off). Last ingredient is up to you if you want to spike or buffer the pH balance. A pinch of gypsum to buffer the pH and a pinch of dehydrated lime to spike the pH. Mix everything together until it's 190¬∞ and pull it off and start pouring into your ketchup cups. 

[or if your using plates do it in front of your flow hood rapidly and seal them all before the temperature drops below 180¬∞ or in a SAB]

Next we need to put our lids on our ketchup cups and wrap them in tin foil like shown in the photos. 

Now your pressure cooker should be hot and be ready to go so take the lid off **again it's very important not to tighten the lid so it can't blow off while you're preheating your PC to save 5-10 minutes while it's heating up to easily pour and place them in your PC** and place your cups stacked in 3's evenly distributed throughout your pressure cooker. Once your PC reaches 15psi pressure cook for 20 minutes **add 5 minutes per thousand feet you live above sea level. If you live at 10,000ft still only at 45 minutes. And max at 45 additional minutes**

Allow your PC to depressurize naturally and then take off the lid. The tin foil should not be very hot because foil doesn't get hot but use a glove to be safe. And now you can start grabbing out the stacks of three and setting them level on the counter. They will congeal/harden and be ready within 20 minutes so you want to have them level so they don't congeal/harden crooked or at an angle.

Pat yourself on the back!!! You just made agar plates without needing a to worry about contamination because they are sealed unlike Petri Dishes. I prefer easily sealing my agar dishes and never having to worry about them being contaminated. These can be used right away so no more waiting to see if you did everything with perfect sterility.

So ang plano namin ngayon ng husband ko ay mag walking-pumunta ng daiso to buy something- then mag grocery. Before pumunta ng grocery nagpplan kame ng menu namin for 1 week. So ready na ko and waiting na lang sknya, so as a housewife, I always clean our house, yung cabinet namin, I always make sure na nakatupi yung mga damit as in home-maker ang atake ko talaga. Then pag open nya ng cabinet gulo gulo sya ng pag tingn ng damit, sabe ko ayusin nya kase lagi na lang magulo yung mga damit, so what he did, tinapon nya palabas ng cabinet at gnulo pa lalo yung damit nya. I waited for him to fix it kase ayaw ko matrigger. Di sya nakinig when i told him to fix it. So lumabas sya ng kwarto, dahil natrigger na ko ang ginawa ko tinapon ko lahat ng damit nya palabas ng kwarto. Bale napunta yung mga damit sa sala.  Bakit ko ginawa? I felt disrespected. Sorry if nabababawan kayo, kase since hindi ako working I felt like hindi na ako wife dito kundi katulong na. (Bago din ako matrigger, nag sabi sya sakin na paano ko daw nililinis yung sapatos ko e wla naman kame shoe cleaner, ayaw nya kase ako bilhan. Then sabi nya sakin bbili sya linisan ko daw shoes nya. Pero hindi ko na ginawang big deal. Kase nga aswa ako. Nagsabe pa ko na bilhan nya ko ng make up as kapalit. Kase hindi namn nya ko binibgyan ng pera to buy. Parang i need to serve him first bago ko makuha yung gsto ko.)

So i stayed in our room and may narinig ako na kalabog, paglabas ko yung mga pang summer clothes namin na nakatago tinapon nya din, bale nasa labas na dn lahat ng damit. as in gulo gulo. even yung mga box, may malaking cabinet kase kame sa labas ng kwarto kung saan dun nakatago yung mga damit na hindi pa appropriate isuot since spring palang ngayon. I explained to him na bakit kailangan nyang gawin yun when I asked him nicely na wag ng guluhin. Kase ganun lagi, alam ko na hindi man ako magalit same result ung gagawin nya hindi nya aayusin yung pagkuha. at the end of the day ako pa din maglilinis kase hindi sya nakinig. 

So now, gsto ko lumabas, umalis kase ayaw ko makita muka nya and gsto ko huminga. Pero I don't know where to go. I don't have money to go somewhere or even go to a coffee shop. Kaya andto ko sa kitchen namin, kinakausap ang sarili na gusto ko ng makalaya at bumalik ng pinas. 

Buti pa nga yung mga angels sa bahay ng amo may sahod. Ako i did everything for free, nag fafarm pa ko pero wala man lang bnibgay sakin. Sa totoo lang nung nasa pinas I had a good job and anoman ung gsto kong bilhin nabbili ko. Tas ngayon pag naiimagine ko na 1000 php pinagdadamot pa sakin. 

takot lang ako to start again kase feeling ko nagsstart palang ulit ako then if makipag divorce ako panibagong start na naman. 

Sana magkaroon ako ng courage to let go. Yun lang, ng makahinga ng maayos man lang. 


Ps,
Hindi ako umiyak, tahimik lang dito sa may kitchen, hindi ko din nilinis yung damit na nakakalat.

Was feeling bold... Signed up for the 1 day STP with zero experience in cycling, group riding and so on... Since about the beginning of April I have been training aggressively on the weekends and casual riding during the week. Today I did my longest ride of 60 miles around Portland averaging 16.2 mph (Moving time). I know around town some of the areas are stop and go which kind of lowers your pace. But about 80% of the time I was in Zone 4 while pushing myself. By the end of it, my thighs were dead. I did have my snacks, water bottles I refilled multiple times at coffee shops with electrolytes. From the suggestions I have seen, people say to ""pace yourself"" How in the world is it even possible to average 17-20 mph while not destroying yourself. All recommendations I have seen is to be in Zone 2-3 most of the time riding STP. This borderline seems impossible??? If you are with a group and are drafting is it that much easier? I would like to train with someone out there who has at least some experience. I will continue on training hard on the weekends either way! Overall I think I will still do it! I will simply call my wife to pick me up if I feel I cannot finish but just looking for the best advice and also someone to ride with around Portland! Thanks!",4,1745727428.0,CyclePDX,11,1.0,False
