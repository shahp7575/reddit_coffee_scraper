I was an associate at the time and when I smelled it on the salesfloor I was eager to tell my mom and grandma about it since they both like the Paris Cafe candle, and on cold the wax smelled amazing 

My mom and I bought two. We both lit ours at separate ends of the house and couldn't smell anything. Like, when we got right next to the candle we could, but otherwise, it was scentless

Well then in 2024 my mom bought FBC again because she thought that maybe the formula improved since that can happen with re-releases. Went home, burned it, same thing. It smelled like nothing to us

I was ready to give up on the scent but this year my mom and I were browsing candles and she insisted on getting FBC. Well, tonight we burned it, and my grandma and aunt were over and they didn't even know that we had a candle going until we told them. That's 4 people who couldn't smell the candle

And it's currently baffling me because I'm assuming it keeps getting brought back because it performs well, so what are people getting from it that several people in my family aren't?

I also have this issue with the Pumpkin Spice Latte 3-wick. I can't smell anything from the 2024 version. I'm assuming it's not that I'm blind to coffee notes because I can smell Paris Cafe well enough and I can smell the new coffee body care really great

1mtaxw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1mtaxw8/how_do_you_take_leave/,How do you take leave?!,"This week I've taken annual leave for the first time since last December. I'm not doing anything radical, just some odd jobs around the house, getting my car serviced, specialist appointment etc. 

Day 1 hasn't been restful. At 11am I had a call from a project team saying I was needed urgently. It couldn't go to another relevant project person because they were off sick for the day. It couldn't be passed up to my boss because he was on annual leave for the day too (and, is now taking a few more extra days). And it couldn't go to one of my two direct reports because they don't have the capability.

I let them know I was in the middle of coffee with a friend and jumped online an hour or so later. It was urgent, sure. But it wasn't difficult. If this team member had looked through the task and thought critically about it, they could have actioned it themselves. I spent an hour on it, told them what they needed to do to wrap up the loose ends, and went back to lounging on the couch. 

I'm firmly of the view that it's the workplace's responsibility to have enough people in a team so that team members can take leave as needed, and additional work can be absorbed. But, since my organisation sacked some casuals in our team, it's getting harder and harder for us to work in that way. 

I spent last week doing extra work to make sure everything would be under control and preparing handover information. I feel like when I get back next Monday, I'll spend the week playing catch up. Leave doesn't actually feel that restful when it's bookended by extra work. 

What do you do to make this more achievable on top of, of course, taking boundaries (I told my team no one was allowed to call me other than my boss. But 11am on Monday and that's already gone out the window). ",2,1755487231.0,auscorp,1,0.75,False
1mtaxqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mtaxqv/my_old_bar_manager_drained_2_years_of_my_life/,My old bar manager drained 2 years of my life,"I worked as a bar hand at a caf√© when I was 23. The job itself wasn‚Äôt rocket science (washing dishes, making drinks, toasting sandwiches) but my manager (a woman in her late 40s/50s) made it hell.

She hated working there. She only treated people she felt ‚Äúclose‚Äù with decently, and for everyone else, she‚Äôd talk absolute shit behind their backs. At first, we got along okay, but then the cracks started showing.

She‚Äôd spend her entire shift hiding behind the dish pit while I ran around doing everything else. And she‚Äôd unload her entire life onto me while I worked, issues with her husband, her kids, her bills, like I was her therapist. And not just me‚Ä¶ she‚Äôd complain about her miserable life to 16 and 18-year-old girls who worked part-time there. Imagine being a teenager and having a middle-aged woman trauma-dump about her marriage onto you while you‚Äôre trying to pull coffees.

By the end of every shift, I wasn‚Äôt just physically exhausted, I was mentally fried. No amount of caffeine could fix it. Eventually, my work started slipping because I was running on autopilot just to survive. That‚Äôs when she turned on me. She‚Äôd make passive-aggressive ‚Äújokes‚Äù about me being lazy or useless, then escalate to outright badmouthing me to others. Word spread, and suddenly my GM thought I was terrible at my job.

Then came the kicker: she got into AMWAY. She tried recruiting me, telling me this was my ‚Äúticket to real money.‚Äù When I refused, she lost it, calling me stupid and dumb to my face for ‚Äúnot wanting more out of life.‚Äù For her, literally everything boiled down to money. Her standards in life were so low it was embarrassing.

It got so bad that I finally told my GM: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs either her or me.‚Äù Things escalated all the way up to the owner. Thankfully, my friends at the caf√© stood by me, and eventually she quit. The vibe instantly got better after she left.

But those 2 years left a mark. I never thought someone so insignificant could chip away at my happiness that much. I look back and wonder why I tolerated it for so long but when you‚Äôre just a broke student trying to pay your bills, you do what you have to do.

1mtawqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1mtawqp/dont_really_know_what_to_do_about_an_ex/,Dont really know what to do about an ex.,"Hi. Big toss up here.

Ive had this woman in my life for about a year now. I (29M) met her (38f) on a dating app. We hit it off and moved a little too fast.

Im a super loyal person. Ive only been with a small handful of people. Im selective and very hesitant. I wont go into that here and now. lol.

We had a discussion about friends and what not within our first month or so of dating. I gave her a general tour of all my friends and how I knew them and she did the same. She mentioned shes still friends with her highschool ex boyfriend and has another friend in the Israeli army. I didnt really pay a mind to it. Found the highschool ex a tad bit weird. But still didnt really care. These obviously werent the only friends she mentioned, just the ones to note.
A week or so after that she told me the friend in the Israeli army is an ex she dated Summer of 2024. Shortly before meeting me. They broke up in September. But keep in touch via email.

I raised a slight eye brow. Asked her what was the plan when he comes to the US next summer again. She said he'll go to Florida because thats where hes from. I didnt really pay a mind further. Keep in mind, this was about a month into the relationship.

Then about 2 months in she tells me she slept with her highschool ex boyfriend about a month before meeting me.

She also mentions that they have rules and boundaries they go by and she plans on meeting him for coffee whenever hes in town which is a couple times a year or so.

At this point, I just started packing up my stuff. I had met a couple of her close friends, her coworkers and her whole family. The whole thing felt confusing so I said I was done.

She then jumped on top of me and tackled me to the ground. Granted shes only like 100 pounds but i kinda fell. and she told me to stay and that I have no idea how hard its been without me here.

She then proceeded to tell me she chooses me over and over again and she loves me and that im this whole entire person she never thought shed meet in her life. But wont not meet her highschool ex boyfriend for coffee when hes in town. i gave a lot of resistance to this. Its not like they have a kid together or any obligations. its just a meet up for pleasure. she wanted me to go too, but why? the whole time im just like whats the big deal and why?

It put a major damper on the relationship because we just kept fighting over and over again. I couldnt understand the fight and resistance for her to meet someone for coffee once a year. And if im this special whatever person, why are we letting this 1 hour event destroy our whole relationship?

She couldnt understand that i would let a 1 hour meet up with a friend maybe once a year could be a big enough deal for me to want to pay a mind to it, because im the one she chooses.

We ended up breaking up a few months later. The ex from Israel came to town for the summer and they started seeing each other. A month or so after that occurrence, she contacted me to re-kindle things. I agreed.

Things were great for about a month. Then we had a situation pop up where she tells me shes still just friends with her ex now and recently drove him to go take some kind of a test. I kinda just was like fuck this.. nothing changed.. and ended it again.

Now im alone again. Wondering did she love me and am I an idiot? Or is she just extremely manipulative, insecure, and selfish and just wanted me around to have her cake and eat it too. dont get me wrong im insecure too. ive made my mistakes. for sure.

I told her I‚Äôm lactose intolerant and still eat dairy so I can‚Äôt pinpoint the cause of symptoms however there were times I‚Äôve cut it out briefly and still had issues. They sent blood panels for crohn‚Äôs, ulcerative colitis and celiac. The latter I‚Äôm still waiting on. I read on the IBD subreddit that blood tests for IBD‚Äôs are merely suggestive while colonoscopies/biopsies are confirmation. However reading here, I‚Äôm under the impression that blood tests for celiac are more definitive compared to the former though and endoscopy is still encouraged.

In any case; I‚Äôve been trying to take note of how I reacted after eating certain foods this week and I‚Äôm starting to think the celiac diagnosis is more solid than I originally suspected. But first I wanna lay down the blood markers I‚Äôve had thus far related to inflammation and gut disorder. 

ESR: 55mm/hr. 3 years ago it was 67

C-Reactive Protein: 11 mg/L

S Cerevisiae IgG 32 units. IgA negative 

Nothing conclusive but still had bits of inflammation for years but I‚Äôve been overweight literally my whole life so I‚Äôve often been told that can contribute. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve noticed this week that I‚Äôve had strong reactions to meals with gluten but little to no reaction to dairy consumption! The log goes:

8/11

Ate hot dog with soda for lunch

Bloating and gut pains then diarrhea after, stools were dark 

More bloating and mild nausea 

8/12

Eat rice with meat and salad

Stomach rumbling, pain 

8/16

Coffee with milk and potatoes with cheese and sour cream for breakfast, no reaction

Pho (noodle soup) with water 

10-15 min later cramping, gas, desire to poop


CAVA(rice and meat with salad) with pita chips 
No reaction 
8/17

Breakfast:

Leftover CAVA with a sip of coffee, water
No reaction


4 pm

Sushi with Pepsi



6-8 pm

Stomach pains

Groggy 

Salmon with rice and green beans 

9pm

More cramps, diarrhea 

Feeling run down

I haven't been able to sleep well. I guess reality is finally starting to finally kick in, and I have to accept that he's truly gone and won't come back. I guess in a small part of my heart I was clinging on to the possibility of him returning. 

Today I hung out with my friends, though. I hadn't seen one of them in years, and the other one I hadn't seen in more than a year. We drank some coffee and walked around our town's mall. Then we played cards until it was time to go. 

One of my ex's hobbies is Magic, so cards always remind me of him. But maybe instead of thinking of him when I play cards, I'll think of my friends. We laughed a lot and had fun. They were very supportive. We're going to hang out on Sundays biweekly. 

When I returned from the mall I cried during the car ride. I miss him so much. 

I still haven't been able to eat a full meal. I feel nauseous all the time. Sometimes I cry so hard that I start gagging and throwing up. 

Before I met him I had 2 boyfriends. One of them I lasted with for a month, the other one a couple of weeks. I cried and felt ""depressed"" after breaking up with them, but lately I've been thinking that those moments truly were  nothing compared to the pain I'm feelings right now.

# Best Cream Washable Rugs 2025: Reviews & Top Picks

cream washable rugs offer a blend of style and practicality, making them a popular choice for homeowners seeking a light and airy aesthetic without the worry of challenging cleaning. these rugs provide a neutral canvas that complements a variety of d√©cor styles, from modern minimalist to cozy farmhouse. The washable aspect is especially appealing to families with children, pet owners, or anyone who wants to maintain a clean and fresh living space with minimal effort. In 2025, advancements in materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the durability, softness, and overall quality of cream washable rugs, solidifying their place as a staple in contemporary homes. This review explores some of the best options available, highlighting their key features, benefits, and suitability for different needs and preferences.

## Key Features Analysis

The best cream washable rugs of 2025 boast several key features that set them apart from traditional rugs and less advanced washable options. These features primarily revolve around durability, washability, softness, and aesthetic appeal.

**material Composition:** The most durable and washable cream rugs are typically made from synthetic fibers like polyester or polypropylene. These materials are naturally stain-resistant and hold up well to repeated washing. High-quality options employ specialized weaving techniques to create a dense pile that resists shedding and wear.

**Weaving Technique:** Machine-loomed rugs frequently enough provide a balance of affordability and durability, while hand-tufted rugs offer a more luxurious feel and intricate designs. Regardless of the method, rugs with a higher knot count tend to be more resilient and less prone to flattening over time. The density of the weave impacts how well the rug maintains its shape and appearance after multiple washes.

**Backing Material:** A non-slip backing is essential for safety and convenience, particularly on hard floors. Options range from rubberized backings to thermoplastic elastomers (TPE), both of which offer excellent grip. The backing material should also be durable enough to withstand washing without crumbling or deteriorating. Some rugs feature a separate, removable rug pad for added cushioning and protection.

**Stain Resistance Technology:** Many cream washable rugs are treated with stain-resistant coatings that prevent spills from penetrating the fibers. This makes cleanup easier and reduces the need for frequent washing. Look for OEKO-TEX certification to ensure that the stain-resistant treatments are free from harmful chemicals and safe for your family and pets.

**Size and Shape variety:** top brands offer cream washable rugs in a wide range of sizes and shapes to accommodate different room layouts and design preferences. From small accent rugs to large area rugs, you can find options to fit living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and even outdoor spaces. Round, rectangular, square, and runner shapes are commonly available, allowing for versatile placement.

**Color and Pattern Options:** While the primary color is cream, these rugs often feature subtle patterns and textures that add visual interest. Options range from simple geometric designs to intricate floral motifs. Some rugs incorporate variations in pile height to create a dimensional effect. The dye used should be fade-resistant to ensure that the color remains vibrant after repeated washing.

## Core Benefits

Cream washable rugs offer a multitude of practical benefits that make them an attractive choice for modern homes. These benefits extend beyond aesthetics, addressing key concerns like hygiene, convenience, and long-term cost savings.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** The ability to easily wash these rugs is a major advantage, especially for households with children, pets, or allergy sufferers. Regular washing removes dust mites, allergens, and bacteria that can accumulate in traditional rugs, promoting a healthier indoor environment.This is particularly beneficial for individuals with sensitivities to dust and mold.

**Easy Maintenance:** Traditional rugs often require professional cleaning or spot treatments, which can be costly and time-consuming. Cream washable rugs can be easily cleaned in a standard washing machine,saving you time,effort,and money. Simply toss the rug in the machine and follow the manufacturer's instructions for washing and drying.

**Stain and Spill Resistance:** The combination of stain-resistant materials and washability makes these rugs virtually impervious to everyday spills and stains. Whether it's coffee spills, pet accidents, or muddy footprints, these rugs can be easily cleaned without leaving behind unsightly marks. This helps to maintain their pristine appearance for longer.

**Versatile Style:** Cream is a neutral color that complements a wide range of d√©cor styles, from modern and minimalist to traditional and bohemian.A cream washable rug can serve as a versatile foundation for your room's design, allowing you to easily change accessories and furniture without clashing with the rug.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** While the initial cost of a cream washable rug may be slightly higher then a traditional rug, the long-term cost savings can be notable. The durability of the materials, combined with the ease of cleaning, means that these rugs are less likely to require replacement or professional cleaning, making them a cost-effective choice over time.## FAQs Section

**Can I put my cream washable rug in the dryer?**
it depends on the manufacturer's instructions. Some rugs can be tumble-dried on low heat, while others should be air-dried to prevent damage to the backing. Always check the care label before drying your rug. Air drying is generally recommended to extend the lifespan of the rug.

**Will the color of my cream washable rug fade after washing?**
High-quality rugs use fade-resistant dyes that hold up well to repeated washing.However, it's always best to wash your rug in cold water and avoid using harsh detergents or bleach. Following the manufacturer's instructions will help to minimize fading and maintain the color vibrancy of your rug.

**Are cream washable rugs safe for pets?**
Yes, most cream washable rugs are made from pet-pleasant materials that are non-toxic and easy to clean. The stain-resistant properties also make them ideal for households with pets, as they can easily withstand accidents. Look for rugs with a durable backing that can withstand scratching and chewing.

**How often should I wash my cream washable rug?**
The frequency of washing depends on the level of traffic and the presence of pets or children. In general, it's recommended to wash your rug every 1-3 months to maintain its cleanliness and hygiene. However, you may need to wash it more frequently if it's exposed to heavy traffic or spills.Spot clean as needed between washes.## Competitor Comparison

Kill my best friend with the knife I was using to cut my birthday cake. 

I didn‚Äôt act on it. 

I never would have. 

But that didn‚Äôt stop the image from seeping in, fogging my brain. 

Around me, voices sang happy birthday in a shaky symphony. 

Balloons bobbed in the air, food covered the table, and my father smiled proudly at me. 

The other kids' voices blurred into white noise, and the knife suddenly felt too heavy, too sharp, clenched tightly in my hand. I stood grinning at the cake, ready to blow out the candles. Then my gaze snagged on the girl across from me. 

That thought turned vivid: how easy it would be to drag the blade across her throat. Two strokes, maybe three. 

Hardly any mess. 

And if there was, the tablecloth could hide it.

Once the thought rooted itself in my skull, it refused to leave. 

Slowly, I lifted my eyes to my father.

The adults would be harder. They would fight back. 

My wandering gaze found his tie tucked into his collar, and I knew exactly how to asphyxiate the breath from his lungs. 

I knew every weak spot. 

Suddenly, their voices were too loud. 

I hated them. 

I hated their stupid singing, and I wanted it to stop. 

My grip tightened on the knife. 

So easy, I thought dizzily, my mind foggy and distant.

It would be so easy to kill them ALL. 

I saw it so vividly, images bleeding effortlessly into my brain.

I was supposed to cut the cake, I told myself. And the cake was so pretty. 

My favorite color. 

Twelve flickering candles smothered in orangeade light. 

I started to move toward it, unaware that my fingers were stroking the serrated edge of the blade, slicing my skin. 

It didn‚Äôt hurt. If anything, the sudden buzz of pain encouraged my thoughts.

‚ÄúMatilda?‚Äù My best friend‚Äôs voice sounded far away. 

I became aware of my happy smile twisting into disgust. I hated her. 

The knife felt so right pressed against my palm, and I wanted to make her hurt. 

I wanted her to stop smiling. 

I don‚Äôt know how much time passed before the singing stopped and the other kids backed away with their parents. 

I flinched when warm hands wrapped around mine, slowly pulling the knife from my trembling fist. 

Blinking rapidly, all the color bled back into the world. 

My father knelt in front of me, his eyes so sad I wanted to cry. 

Before he could speak, I sucked in a breath and stumbled back, my gaze fixed on the knife. I didn‚Äôt have to say anything. We both knew.

My hand stung now, the pain sharp and cutting. I stared at the red pooling across my palm. No matter what Dad told me, or my therapist, I thought it was beautiful.

Blood oozing and pooling and trickling, spattering and painting skin, walls, carpet, flooring,

Blood.

Exploding and imploding from the backs of heads, dripping from noses and lips, tainting flesh.

It was beautiful.

I didn‚Äôt care what anyone else said, my mind was too far gone, too intrusive and powerful over my sense of being.

The thought of slashing my best friend‚Äôs throat and painting my birthday cake a glorious, startling red filled me with an emotion I didn‚Äôt yet understand. 

Still, as quickly as the thoughts came, they slipped away, leaving me sick to my stomach, brandishing a knife like I wanted to hurt someone. 

I will never forget the look on my best friend‚Äôs face. Her wide eyes, her twisted lips. She was terrified of me, and there was no way to undo that.

Six moves. Six towns. Each time, I thought I was okay.

I thought the thoughts wouldn‚Äôt return. But I was na√Øve. They always came back. And that was enough to send me spiraling.

‚ÄúDaddy?‚Äù My voice was soft. My fingers felt raw without the knife.

I choked on a sob. ‚ÄúDid I do it again?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! No, of course not! It was just a slip-up, okay? You‚Äôre okay, sweetie. I promise.‚Äù

Dad was too quick to reply. He was already turning to apologize to the party guests.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù His voice was like a blade sliding into my brain. ‚ÄúMy daughter‚Ä¶ she‚Ä¶ suffers from a condition.‚Äù

The guests murmured among themselves.

‚ÄúCondition?‚Äù Mrs. Leela, my best friend‚Äôs mom, let out a horrified laugh. ‚ÄúYou call that a condition? She needs to be hospitalized!‚Äù

Before my dad could answer, she was dragging her daughter away.

The others followed, muttering words I didn‚Äôt fully understand. Psychosis. Schizophrenic. Nutcase.

No matter how hard I tried to push away the thought, I wanted to hold the knife. 

When I pressed my head into my lap, Dad‚Äôs arms wrapped around me, pulling me into his chest. 

He shook his head, whispering that it hadn‚Äôt happened again, that it never would. But I knew better.

I knew it would. 

Because even pressed against his jacket, which smelled like cologne and home, my body trembled with the urge to do the unthinkable. 

He‚Äôs weak, my mind whispered. It‚Äôs the perfect time to attack. 

Dad told me it was okay to raise my arms and hug him back, but I wouldn‚Äôt allow myself. 

Because I knew if I freed my arms, if I relaxed my muscles, they would go around his neck, snapping it without a second thought.

. 

Six weeks ago, I was sitting in a coffee shop with my housemates.

I can‚Äôt remember what I was working on. My laptop sat open, abandoned hours ago. 

Freddie, my housemate, sat opposite me, eyes glued to his phone. 

I was staring into the dregs of my coffee when Freddie‚Äôs boyfriend, Isaac, finally slumped into a chair, throwing an arm around him. ‚ÄúBrainwashing support group, huh.‚Äù He leaned back, brow raised. 

‚ÄúThat's ominous.‚Äù

That caught my attention.

I lifted my gaze. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Isaac pointed behind me. ‚ÄúLooks like the freshmen are playing weird shit again...""

His voice faded as I twisted in my chair to look at the poster. 

It looked new, printed in Times New Roman:

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN BRAINWASHED?

Underneath:

For support, come join us at the campus library.

We‚Äôre a small group, and we share stories. 

Our aim is to find survivors willing to tell their story.

‚ÄúMattie?‚Äù

Freddie‚Äôs low murmur pulled me back, though the words on the poster kept burning in my mind. 

We left the caf√©, my housemates chatting between themselves.

But I was trapped in the past, old memories bleeding back to life.

I wasn‚Äôt even aware that I had stopped walking, like my body had taken over.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm gonna head to campus to study,‚Äù I heard myself say.

Freddie stopped, turning to look at me. ‚ÄúAre you okay? You seem‚Ä¶ off.‚Äù

‚ÄúTired,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúTired?‚Äù He looked skeptical. ‚ÄúDid all that espresso go straight to your brain?‚Äù

I groaned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Go on ahead.‚Äù

They exchanged glances. 

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Freddie rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúHave fun.‚Äù

The two of them walked away, Issac dragging my roommate into a run. 

Initially, I had no idea where I was going. 

I stopped in front of the campus library, its tall, shadowed facade looming over me. 

I had always thought of it as a safe place, though not tonight. 

Warm light spilled across the walkway as I stepped toward the doors, ready to pull them open and escape inside. 

That‚Äôs when I noticed him, a figure leaning casually against the wall. 

As I drew closer, his features sharpened into focus, a guy about my age, thick brown hair falling into his eyes, a trench coat thrown over jeans and a simple tee.

A crumbling cigarette dangled between his fingers, smoke curling lazily into the air. 

He had just enough of a striking presence to make me hesitate. 

I turned toward the door, ready to slip inside, but at the last second I faltered. 

To avoid looking obvious, I pulled out my phone and pretended to check a message.

‚ÄúYour phone isn‚Äôt on, genius.‚Äù

The guy surprised me with a gruff laugh. He was right. My phone had died halfway through my study session.

Choosing to ignore him, I shoved my phone in my pocket. ‚ÄúAre you going in?‚Äù

When he turned to me, the building‚Äôs light casting his face in sharp relief, something inside me snapped. Fight or flight surged through my veins. 

His lips curved around the cigarette, and I couldn‚Äôt look away, mesmerized by the fluidity of his movements and the glint in his eyes. A glint that was far too familiar.

I knew that smile. I knew those sharp, precise motions. 

My mind felt like it was unraveling. 

Until this moment, it was as if he had chosen to hide himself. 

My body moved before my brain caught up. I stumbled back, breath stolen from my lungs, and in a blur of unnatural speed, he grabbed me and slammed me against the wall. 

‚ÄúDo you know how many fucking colleges we‚Äôve been to?‚Äù he gasped through a hysterical giggle that didn‚Äôt match his eighteen-year-old voice. 

He carried the childlike innocence of an eight-year-old trapped in a grown body, but that psychotic smile, the one I knew so well, twisted his lips.

‚ÄúEvery college town, every university you can imagine. Searching for you. And here you are.‚Äù His breath tickled my face. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you were stupid enough, but here you are. Hook, line, and sinker.‚Äù

So close. I knew exactly how to get away. One jerk of my hand, and I could break his neck.

But I couldn‚Äôt move.

Then came the sound of running footsteps, ghosting closer, dancing toward me, and a single, horrifying thought struck me.

They‚Äôve found me.

The guy stepped closer, one hand slamming me against the rough brick, his fingers digging into my throat. ‚ÄúMa-til-da,‚Äù he hissed, spitting each letter in my face. 

His smile twisted, more maniacal by the second. Leaning in further, his breath was ice cold, buckling my knees. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm *sorry*, I must be going fucking insane! Correct me if I'm wrong, but do you not remember our *orders*?‚Äù

His words were enough to bring memories back, sharp and cruel, slicing into me.

Reminding me why I tried to kill my friends at my twelfth birthday party, and why I had been in solitary confinement for a whole year.

Elementary school.

I lost my mind in elementary school.

I remember walking into class with a bounce in my step. It was spring, and I was enjoying the cherry blossoms outside. 

I spent the last ten minutes running around, trying to catch petals in my cupped hands until Dad told me to head inside. I wasn‚Äôt expecting a new teacher when I slumped into my seat. 

I was used to Mrs. Clarabelle, who wore pretty dresses and had rainbow-colored hair that smelled like apples. 

Instead of her, a stranger stood at the front of the class, and from my classmates‚Äô expressions, none of them knew who she was.

She didn‚Äôt look like a teacher. Unlike Mrs. Clarabelle‚Äôs extravagantly colored dresses, this woman wore a black suit. Her hair was in a strict ponytail, and a pair of Ray-Bans pinned back her fringe. 

Ross Torres leaned across his desk, eyes wide. ‚ÄúAre you a secret agent?‚Äù

I had to agree. 

She really did look like a secret agent. 

I loved watching spy movies, so it was jarring to sit right in front of one. 

When the woman‚Äôs lip quirked into a slight smile, I relaxed in my chair.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said warmly, before turning to the whiteboard and grabbing a pen. ‚ÄúBut I will be your teacher starting today.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Mrs. Clarabelle?‚Äù Ross pulled a face, leaning back. ‚ÄúShe was my favorite! I don‚Äôt want her to goooooo.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù Evie Clare joined in, standing with her arms folded. If there was a social hierarchy in elementary school, Evie was at the top. I usually stayed away from her. 

Her parents were rich, and she often looked down on other kids who weren‚Äôt as well dressed. 

She had her own little group of minions who followed her like she was a queen. 

When Evie stood, she spoke for the class, like she had when Mrs. Clarabelle banned Tamagotchis. 

Evie had led a rebellion, convincing us to refuse lunch if we weren‚Äôt allowed Tamagotchis. Surprisingly, the ban was lifted.

‚ÄúThis girl is like our third-grade class spokesperson,‚Äù I thought.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know who you are, you could be a stranger,‚Äù Evie said. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Mrs. Clarabelle? She is our teacher.‚Äù

Something darkened in the woman‚Äôs eyes, and she cleared her throat.

‚ÄúPlease sit down. I will explain once you take your seat.‚Äù She cleared her throat again. ‚ÄúAlso, I am not stupid. Young lady, I can see the candy under your desk.‚Äù

Her gaze flitted to Ross. ‚ÄúAnd yours.‚Äù She held out her hand. ‚ÄúThrow it in the trash, please. I do not allow candy in my classroom.‚Äù

The two of them complied. Evie took dramatic strides, pretending to toss gold-plated candy into the trash, but she got rid of it.

‚ÄúOkay, now that‚Äôs taken care of!‚Äù I watched our new teacher write: Hello! My name is Mrs. Hanna! followed by a giant smiley face. Underneath: Can you tell me your names?

‚ÄúMrs Hanna.‚Äù Evie raised her hand, a sly smile on her lips. ‚ÄúThe smile on the smiley face is wonky.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù Ross turned to her with a grin. ‚ÄúWhy do you care, weirdo?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause.‚Äù Evie slapped her desk. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like wonky things. That smile is wonky. I want her to change it.‚Äù

Mrs Hanna nodded. ‚ÄúRight. I‚Äôm sorry, Evie.‚Äù She winked, wiped away the smile with a flick of her finger, and redrew it. ‚ÄúOr should I call you Princess Evie?‚Äù

She laughed when Evie looked startled, then did a dramatic spin to face all of us.

‚ÄúOkay! As I said, I need your names, don‚Äôt I?‚Äù She pointed to the back row. ‚ÄúDo you want me to start calling you names that pop into my head?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù we all shouted back.

‚ÄúWell, hurry!‚Äù Mrs Hanna had an energy our old teacher didn‚Äôt. Mrs Clarabelle had been sweet and quiet. 

Mr Hanna was more daring, making classes a lot more fun. 

Instead of planting flowers and singing songs, we were allowed to scream. 

She pointed right at me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ Ozzy, right?‚Äù She chuckled, moving on to Mara Highcliffe behind me. ‚ÄúAnd you look like a Benny Two Shoes.‚Äù

Evie pointed to herself. ‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù

‚ÄúPegasus.‚Äù

The girl giggled, then slammed her hand over her mouth in mock horror. ‚ÄúPegasus is a stupid name!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù Ross jumped up, raising his arm. ‚ÄúCan I have a funny name?‚Äù

Mrs Hanna turned to him, her lip curling. ‚ÄúHmm.‚Äù She pretended to think, tapping her chin. ‚ÄúPhoenix!‚Äù

The classroom erupted with laughter, kids yelling their real names, and I joined in, shouting mine along with the others.

‚ÄúRoss!‚Äù
‚ÄúMara!‚Äù
‚ÄúSadie!‚Äù
‚ÄúEvie!‚Äù
‚ÄúJasper!‚Äù
‚ÄúPippa!‚Äù
‚ÄúMatilda!‚Äù

I cupped my mouth to make sure I was loud enough. Ozzy was a cool name.

Nodding to each of us, Mrs Hanna covered the whiteboard with all of our names, then put the lid back on the pen. 

""It's nice to meet all of you!"" 

And so her classes began. 

The best part was that Mrs Hanna didn‚Äôt make us do proper work.

Instead, we had to focus hard to read what was written on a blank piece of paper. 

Initially, I couldn‚Äôt read it. 

None of us could, no matter how hard we squinted and flipped the paper over, frowning at it from different angles. 

Mrs Hanna reassured us we were close.

I was never close.

The paper hurt my head.

‚ÄúPractice makes perfect!‚Äù she would always sing when kids started to cry with frustration. 

I will say it started to get painful. 

The girl sitting behind me, Pippa, began complaining her head hurt, followed by other kids. 

But with the pain came clarity. 

One day, Pippa jumped up, raising her hand, her lips split with glee.

‚ÄúMrs Hanna!‚Äù she squealed, waving the paper in the air. 

Every day we were expected to spend at least an hour trying to read the paper. None of us had even come close. 

We only got headaches. Adam Moore got a nosebleed.

Pippa wasn‚Äôt exactly the smartest in the class. She thought Canada was the capital of Australia. 

So, we were all surprised when she jumped from her desk, swiping at her head. 

Twisting around in my chair to look at her, I could tell from the crinkle between her brows and the slight curl in her lip that she was in pain.

‚ÄúI did it!‚Äù she squealed, attracting Mrs Hanna‚Äôs attention.

The teacher straightened up from where she had been helping Eleanor Chase. 

She raised her hand, quieting the classroom from the buzz of chatter following Pippa‚Äôs announcement. 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Mrs Hanna‚Äôs eyes glittered, her pearly smile widening.

‚ÄúWhat does it say, Pippa?‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt noticed how pale the girl was until I looked at her properly. 

‚ÄúIt says‚Ä¶‚Äù Pippa cleared her throat dramatically, making sure everyone was listening and that she was the center of attention. I didn‚Äôt like Pippa. 

She pretended to be the smarty-pants, despite knowing all her test answers were wrong. 

I couldn‚Äôt help feeling jealous.

‚ÄúIt says‚Ä¶‚Äù Pippa dragged out the words, giggling.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs taking too long,‚Äù Ross grumbled in front of me. When he caught my eye, he looked equally annoyed.

‚ÄúYeah, I bet she‚Äôs lying,‚Äù Evie said loudly, sticking out her tongue at Pippa. 

‚ÄúCan you tell us? We‚Äôre getting bored.‚Äù The girl mimed a yawn, and the rest of the class giggled. ‚ÄúUnless you‚Äôre lying, Pippa.‚Äù

Pippa‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lying!‚Äù

‚ÄúThen tell us what it says!‚Äù Evie‚Äôs lip curled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just pretending to be dramatic. I know your game.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvie, that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù Mrs Hanna shot her a look, and Evie backed down, turned around in her chair, and huffed loudly. The teacher‚Äôs attention flicked back to Pippa.

‚ÄúAlright, what does it say? You can tell the whole class, sweetie. Don‚Äôt worry. They‚Äôll be able to see it soon.‚Äù

Nodding, Pippa showed us the blank piece of paper. ‚ÄúIt says we‚Äôre going to be doing something really special!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù Ross asked, frowning.

Mrs Hanna pretended to zip her lips. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not supposed to tell you, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

She leaned forward, and so did we, eagerly.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have a special class,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to tell you, so you have to be quiet!‚Äù

Her words confused me. ‚ÄúWho are you not supposed to tell?‚Äù I asked, cocking my head.

Mrs Hanna‚Äôs gaze found mine, and for the first time I saw them as piercing. ‚ÄúDo you want to be in the special class or not, Matilda?‚Äù

I shrugged, my cheeks blazing when my classmates giggled.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúOkay. Well, special children do not ask questions that do not concern them. Do you understand, Matilda?‚Äù

Ducking my head, I nodded. ‚ÄúYes, Mrs Hanna.‚Äù

With the promise of an extra special class if we all managed to see through the invisible paper, our class tried harder. 

There were more headaches, more nosebleeds, and crying, before Ross jumped up from his chair one day, practically vibrating with glee. 

I think he was so excited he didn‚Äôt notice blood dripping down his chin.

Mrs. Hanna cleaned him up and praised him, promising him and the other kids that they could go on the field trip.

Evie was next. Of course she was. The girl was super dramatic, twirling in her dress, claiming she was the best because she didn‚Äôt suffer a headache or a nosebleed. 

I did, however, glimpse her shoving bloody tissue paper into the trash during recess.

I started to notice a change in the kids who had begun to see the hidden message on the paper‚Äîand in the rest of us who were still struggling.

Pippa had grown unusually silent since announcing she could read the paper. 

Mrs. Hanna had given her extra work to do, but every time I slipped past her to go to the bathroom, I noticed she wasn‚Äôt even writing. Her eyes were half-lidded, her lips set in a dreamy smile.

Pippa could see something I couldn‚Äôt. Swallowing a thick paste that crept up my throat, I realized her expression scared me. It reminded me of my mom‚Äôs when I said goodbye to her four years ago. 

Mom didn't even made eye contact‚Äîjust grasped my hand and muttered my name.

Needless to say, I really didn‚Äôt want to be left out of the special class.

Despite my classmates acting weird, I forced myself to break through the barrier. 

She explained that there was a barrier inside every brain. 

To make it easier to understand, she did a theatrical re-enactment‚Äîextra goofy, of course.

Mrs. Hanna stood in front of a desk and made a dramatic face. 

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù she said, tapping the wooden surface, ‚Äúis your brain, everyone!‚Äù

We all laughed, and she rolled a chair into place. ‚ÄúAnd this? This is the barrier keeping you from reaching your potential? That‚Äôs what I want you to do with your paper. Imagine breaking the barrier so you can see the desk clearly.‚Äù

‚ÄúBreaking the chair!‚Äù We all sang as our teacher jumped onto the desk and pumped her arms. ‚ÄúBreaking the chair!‚Äù

So that‚Äôs what I did.

Or I tried to. I was one of the last ones to break through the barrier. 

One night, I asked Dad if he could help me solve a problem. 

Mrs. Hanna told us not to tell our parents about the fun games we were playing, so I asked him about a particularly hard math sum. He looked up from his laptop, offering a pensive smile over his coffee.

‚ÄúTry relaxing your mind and thinking about something else,‚Äù Dad said. 

‚ÄúAnd then, who knows? Maybe if you put less strain on yourself, it might come to you?‚Äù He pulled a face. ‚ÄúI can give you the answer if you want.‚Äù

I did exactly what Dad told me: I didn‚Äôt think about the blank piece of paper all night, and during normal classes, I pushed it out of my head.

At recess, there was nobody to play with anymore. 

The kids who could read the message stayed in class, staring into thin air. 

Sometimes Mrs. Hanna brought people in to talk to them. 

They weren‚Äôt teachers‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt know who they were.

All of them had scary faces and were my dad‚Äôs age. 

I watched them poke and prod my classmates, asking questions like, ‚ÄúAre you able to see this?‚Äù while holding several blank pieces of colored cards. 

Ross, Evie, and the others nodded, while Mrs. Hanna stood by with an odd look on her face.

I decided that day I would become like them. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be left out like the other two kids. 

So I slumped down at my desk, put my head down, and glared at the paper until a dull pain blossomed behind my eyes, the lights above me suddenly far too bright.

Blank. 

I stared harder.

Blank!

I gritted my teeth so hard I could taste rusty coins at the back of my mouth.

Getting progressively more frustrated, I decided to pretend I didn‚Äôt care, just like when my PlayStation didn‚Äôt work and I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for the game to load. 

Trying the same tactic, I clenched my fists and mentally told the piece of paper I didn‚Äôt care. I was through caring. 

Stubbornly, I sat with my arms folded, staring into the backs of my eyes, before deciding I had spent enough time ignoring the paper. 

Cracking one eye open, I expected to find the same blank sheet in front of me. However, this time the paper wasn‚Äôt blank.

I was half-aware of rivulets of sharp, startling red spotting pallid white.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in the special class!‚Äù

Dad was right. Ignoring my own blood staining the collar of my shirt and pooling on my desk, my lips split into a grin.

It was trying too hard, forcing it, that had been stopping me.

Once I told everyone I could see the paper, I was let into the secret group. 

This time we had to visualize certain things in front of us.

It started with a stuffed animal. 

That was easy. I could visualize it perfectly, until I could reach out and touch its prickly fur. It felt real, like I was touching a real stuffed toy. 

Then the images started to get blurry, and I lost track of the time. 

So did the sessions. 

I remembered the start of them, but time seemed to pass quickly. 

Before I knew it, I was sitting in the back of Dad‚Äôs car, trying to remember what I had been doing all afternoon. 

Still, I was happy I broke through the barrier.

I did start getting nosebleeds a lot. Also falling asleep and forgetting things. 

I remember sitting in front of the TV watching SpongeBob, but the next thing I knew, I was halfway down our driveway, and Dad‚Äôs hand was on my shoulder.

‚ÄúMattie!‚Äù It was his third attempt at shouting my name, and finally his voice slid into my brain. I awoke barefoot, my soles on prickly concrete that felt like an anchor, something I could hold onto.

I wanted to tell Dad about the sessions, but Mrs. Hanna had made us promise not to tell our parents. 

Dad didn‚Äôt want to send me to school the next morning. 

He said I could stay home and watch cartoons. 

But I didn‚Äôt want to miss out on the extra class. 

So, despite feeling like crap, I insisted I was okay and told him to drive me to school.

Ross was standing outside, though his expression was scary. 

He didn‚Äôt look at me when I asked if he was okay, and his nose was bleeding.

‚ÄúRoss?‚Äù I prodded him. 

Again, he didn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúRoss.‚Äù I shoved him, and finally he turned to me. I expected him to at least hit me playfully.

‚ÄúI don't feel well,‚Äù he mumbled. ‚ÄúI want to go home.‚Äù

I giggled. ‚ÄúWell that means I'm stronger than you!‚Äù

His eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúNo you're not. You're a girl.‚Äù

I flicked him on the nose, expecting my friend to push me back, laughing. 

Except he didn‚Äôt smile. Instead, Ross swiped at his nose, turned away, and strode into school, clutching his backpack.

When I followed him inside, Ross had stopped on the threshold. 

For the first time in a while, he looked confused, his gaze on our chaotic classroom. 

Pippa was standing on the desk, waving her arms and laughing, and Evie was screaming at her to get down, the rest of the kids trying to egg them into fighting. 

For a moment I was confused why the classroom was so crazy‚Äîand then my gaze found the empty space where Mrs. Hanna should have been. Mrs. Hanna was never late.

Ross found his desk quickly, and I followed, slumping into my own. 

I twisted around to ask Mara what was happening before the door flew open, crashing into the wall. 

Mrs. Hanna stepped into the classroom, and immediately Pippa hopped off the desk and Evie backed into her seat, her eyes wide.

Mrs. Hanna didn‚Äôt comment on the fighting. 

Instead, she strode to the front of the class without a word, picked up a whiteboard pen, and began to write with enough vigor to scare us into silence. 

She wrote one word in block capitals, spanning the entire board:

CHEATER.

When she turned to us, I realized she didn‚Äôt look as tidy as usual. 

Mrs. Hanna was wearing the same pantsuit from the day before, her usual ponytail falling out, tangled strands in her eyes. 

She hit the board three times, and we all jumped.

‚ÄúI would like you to tell me what a cheater is.‚Äù Her voice was different‚Äîlow, a lot scarier. I had grown used to her laughter.

Now, though, it was like looking at a different person. 

I could tell the others didn‚Äôt want to speak in fear of being shouted at, but Ross Torres was brave, no matter how scary our teacher was. 

Leaning back in his chair, he cleared his throat.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an animal, right?‚Äù He gave a nervous giggle. ‚ÄúThey like‚Ä¶ run fast.‚Äù

We all jumped when she hit the board again.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Mrs. Hanna‚Äôs expression was fuming. ‚ÄúNo, that is not what a cheater is.‚Äù

She turned back to the board. ‚ÄúA cheater is a lying son of a‚Äî‚Äù 

She caught herself when Evie giggled. 

It took her a moment to get hold of herself before turning her attention back to us.

‚ÄúThey said it‚Äôs impossible to train young children. And yet‚Ä¶ here I am.‚Äù She began pacing.

‚ÄúHe said it was morally wrong.‚Äù Mrs. Hanna‚Äôs eyes locked on mine, her lips curling into a smile that made my stomach churn. 

‚ÄúBut why would I waste it, hmm? Why would I waste weeks, no, months, of shaping young minds for nothing?‚Äù

Mrs. Hanna let out a hysterical laugh. ‚ÄúNo! No, I am crazy.‚Äù I watched her pace back and forth, entranced by her movements.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt get in trouble because I‚Äôm going to fucking die, but a group of eight-year-olds? Fifteen snot-nosed little brats who I can prove have the potential to be something more by blowing his fucking head off. And his slut of a wife.‚Äù

One of the boys gasped, and Ross quickly turned to shush him.

‚ÄúShh!‚Äù he giggled. ‚ÄúMrs. Hanna‚Äôs been drinking crazy juice.‚Äù

Our teacher‚Äôs smile widened as she turned toward us, but it was a smile I no longer trusted.

‚ÄúYes, Ross,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have been drinking crazy juice. But do you know what you are?‚Äù Her gaze flicked erratically across all of us.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Pippa asked.

‚ÄúSpecial.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by special?‚Äù Evie asked. ‚ÄúBecause my mommy says I‚Äôm the only special one here.‚Äù

Mrs. Hanna didn‚Äôt answer directly. Instead, she spoke to all of us. ‚ÄúWho,‚Äù she let out a breathy laugh, ‚Äúwho wants to watch TV?‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure what we were supposed to be watching. 

At first, I thought they were shapes we had to name. 

But then the shapes grew bigger until they filled the screen. I remember lurching back in my chair, though I couldn‚Äôt move. 

On screen, a picture of a man flashed up so fast I bit back a shriek. 

When I tried to move or tear my gaze away, I couldn‚Äôt. 

The room was pitch black except for the screen illuminating my face.

I couldn‚Äôt look away. I was aware my body was jerking, my breaths heavy. 

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù Mrs. Hanna said, her voice rattling inside my skull. 

I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. My mouth moved before I could think, repeating her words.

*‚ÄúThis.‚Äù*

I spat it out in unison with the others. Her words weren‚Äôt just sounds. 

They were physical, splitting my skull, bleeding straight into my brain.

*‚ÄúIs my husband.‚Äù*

The words tore from my lips in a river of red.

*‚ÄúIs.‚Äù*
*‚ÄúMy.‚Äù*
*‚ÄúHusband.‚Äù*

‚ÄúI LOVED him,‚Äù she continued. And so did we. 

*‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ LOVED‚Ä¶ him.‚Äù*

Next to me, Ross spluttered blood across his desk, eyes darting back and forth, locked on the TV screen.

‚ÄúHe cheated on me with that sly, fucking wretch,‚Äù she said, tears streaking her face.

*‚ÄúHe cheated on you,‚Äù* We echoed. *‚ÄúWith that‚Ä¶ sly, fucking wretch.‚Äù*

Her anguish became ours. Her sobs entangled us. Suffocating us. 

Tears ran down my cheeks. 

But they weren‚Äôt mine. Her heartbreak twisted in my chest, agonizing.

‚ÄúAnd now,‚Äù Mrs. Hanna spat.

Blood shot from my nose. 

My body jerked violently.

*‚ÄùAnd‚Ä¶ n-now.‚Äù*

Her lips split into a grin. ‚ÄúHe must fucking die.‚Äù

I opened my mouth, but my words were no longer mine.

There was something alive, crawling, inside my head.

And no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get it out. 

*‚ÄùHe.‚Äù* 

The word was like poison, rattling my body. 

*‚ÄùMust.‚Äù*

My head drooped, my eyes forced open, blood coating my tongue.

*‚ÄúFucking.‚Äù*

The girl next to me wasn't moving, her left eye hanging out of its socket. 

But Ross sat still, smiling, unblinking, gaze fixated on the screen. 

Blood dripped from his lips, his chin, seeping across his desk. 

He smelled of burning, like charred chicken.

As a small business owner, you live and breathe the dance of risk and reward. You risk your capital, your time, and your energy for the reward of building something you believe in‚Äîa thriving business that serves its customers and supports your dreams. But what happens when a transaction goes sideways? What happens when a customer, for reasons legitimate or not, disputes a charge, triggering a chargeback?

Suddenly, you‚Äôre not just out the sale. You‚Äôre hit with a chargeback fee, your product is likely gone, and your payment processing history takes a hit. It feels personal, like a punch to the gut. For a small business, a string of these can be more than just frustrating; they can be financially devastating.

This is where the game of risk and reward sharpens to a fine point. The risk is in every transaction, but the reward comes from being prepared. The single most powerful tool in your arsenal isn't aggressive customer service or fancy software; it‚Äôs a set of clear, comprehensive, and consistently enforced policies. Think of them as your chargeback shield. A well-crafted payment policy, supported by other key business policies, is your front-line defense, your evidence, and your best chance at winning a dispute before it even begins.

This guide is designed for you‚Äîthe coffee shop owner, the online boutique proprietor, the freelance graphic designer, the heart and soul of the small business world. We‚Äôre going to break down exactly how to build a chargeback shield with policies that not only protect your bottom line but also build customer trust and confidence.

# The Foundation: Your Crystal-Clear Return & Refund Policy

The most common source of chargebacks stems from confusion or dissatisfaction with a purchase. A customer feels they didn‚Äôt get what they paid for, the item was defective, or they simply changed their mind. Before they even think of calling their bank, your return and refund policy should be the first place they look.

If it‚Äôs hard to find, confusing, or overly restrictive, you‚Äôre practically inviting a dispute. The goal here is clarity and accessibility.

**Best Practices for Your Return & Refund Policy:**

* **Make It Easy to Find:** Don‚Äôt bury it. Your policy should be linked in your website footer, on product pages, in your order confirmation emails, and even on your checkout page. A customer should never have to hunt for it.
* **Use Plain English:** Avoid legal jargon. Write in a way that is easy for anyone to understand. Use headings, bullet points, and bold text to break up the information.
   * **Bad Example:** ""All sales are considered final unless the merchandise is found to be materially defective upon receipt, in which case a request for a return merchandise authorization (RMA) must be submitted within 72 hours.""
   * **Good Example:** ""Changed your mind? No problem! We accept returns within 30 days of purchase. Here‚Äôs how it works:""
* **Clearly Define the ""Who, What, When, How"":**
   * **What can be returned?** (e.g., all items, only unused items in original packaging, sale items are final).
   * **When can it be returned?** (e.g., 14 days, 30 days, 90 days from purchase date).
   * **How will they be refunded?** (e.g., original form of payment, store credit). Be explicit. If you only offer store credit for certain returns, state it clearly.
   * **Who pays for shipping?** (e.g., customer is responsible for return shipping, or you provide a prepaid label).
* **Set Expectations for Processing Time:** Let customers know how long it will take to process the return and issue the refund once you receive the item. ""Please allow 5-7 business days for us to process your return after it arrives at our workshop.""

**Pro Tip:** Require customers to check a box at checkout that says, ""I have read and agree to the Return & Refund Policy."" This creates a digital paper trail proving they were aware of your terms before completing the purchase‚Äîa powerful piece of evidence in a dispute.

# The Proof of Delivery: Your Shipping & Delivery Policy

""I never got it."" This is one of the most difficult chargeback claims to fight, especially for businesses shipping physical goods. Without proof of delivery, it becomes your word against the customer's. A robust shipping policy, combined with meticulous execution, is your best defense.

**Best Practices for Your Shipping & Delivery Policy:**

* **Provide Tracking for Everything:** This is non-negotiable. Even for small items, the cost of tracking is a small price to pay for the insurance it provides against ""item not received"" claims. Make sure the tracking number is automatically sent to the customer as soon as the order ships.
* **Require a Signature for High-Value Items:** If you‚Äôre selling expensive goods, signature confirmation is a must. It‚Äôs definitive proof that the item was received by a person at the specified address. Yes, it‚Äôs an extra cost, but it can save you thousands in a single dispute.
* **Clearly State Shipping Timelines:** On your product and checkout pages, provide realistic estimates for processing and shipping times. ""Orders are typically processed in 1-2 business days. Standard shipping takes an additional 3-5 business days."" Under-promise and over-deliver whenever possible.
* **Document Your Packaging Process:** For high-value or fragile items, consider taking a quick photo of the item packaged in the box with the shipping label visible before you seal it. This can be invaluable evidence if a customer claims they received an empty box or the wrong item.
* **Address and P.O. Box Verification:** Use address verification services (AVS) offered by your payment processor. This tool checks that the billing address entered by the customer matches the one on file with their credit card company. For shipping, be clear about whether you ship to P.O. boxes.

# The Rulebook: Your Terms of Service (TOS)

Your Terms of Service is the overarching contract between you and your customer. It sets the rules of engagement for everything from how they can use your website to the specifics of your payment policy. While many customers may not read it in full, its existence is crucial for winning disputes, especially those related to services or digital products.

**Key Elements for Your TOS:**

* **Detailed Service Descriptions:** For service-based businesses (consulting, design, coaching), your TOS should be incredibly detailed about what the service includes and, just as importantly, what it *doesn‚Äôt* include. Define the scope of work, the number of revisions, and the deliverables. This prevents ""service not as described"" chargebacks.
* **Billing and Payment Terms:** Reiterate your payment policy here. State when payment is due (e.g., upfront, 50% deposit, upon completion). If you offer subscriptions, the cancellation and refund policy for recurring billing must be crystal clear. You must state how a customer can cancel, the notice period required, and what happens to their access post-cancellation.
* **""Acceptance of Work"" Clause:** For project-based work, include a clause that defines how the client formally accepts the final product. This could be a final sign-off email or the act of using the delivered work. Once they‚Äôve accepted it, it becomes much harder to claim the service wasn't rendered.
* **Communication Policy:** Outline your official channels and hours of communication. This can help manage expectations and prevent disputes arising from a customer feeling ignored over a weekend.

Just like with your return policy, require customers to agree to your TOS before they can complete a purchase or sign up for a service. This affirmative action is a cornerstone of your defense.

# The Evidence Locker: Meticulous Record-Keeping

When a chargeback is filed, the card issuer opens an investigation. They will ask you, the merchant, to provide compelling evidence that the charge was legitimate. Vague recollections or missing invoices won‚Äôt cut it. You need a well-organized evidence locker.

**Your Essential Documentation Checklist:**

* **Customer Communications:** Save every email, chat log, and social media message. If a customer emails you saying, ""I love the new branding you designed!"" and then files a chargeback a week later claiming the service wasn't as described, that email is your golden ticket.
* **Invoices and Receipts:** Ensure your receipts are detailed. They should include the customer's name, billing and shipping address, a description of the item or service, and the date of the transaction.
* **Proof of Delivery:** Keep tracking numbers and delivery confirmation receipts readily accessible.
* **Digital Footprints:** For online businesses, IP logs showing the customer's location at the time of purchase, combined with AVS and CVV (the three-digit code on the back of the card) confirmation, paint a strong picture of a legitimate transaction.
* **Signed Contracts/Agreements:** For any significant service or custom work, a signed contract is your best friend.

Organize these records by customer or transaction number so you can quickly pull everything together when the chargeback notification arrives. You typically have a limited time to respond, so being prepared is key.

# The Human Element: Training Your Team

Your policies are only as good as the people who enforce them. Your customer service team is on the front lines of chargeback prevention. A single well-handled customer interaction can de-escalate a potential dispute into a happy resolution.

**Training Essentials for Your Staff:**

* **Know the Policies Inside and Out:** Every employee who interacts with customers should be an expert on your return, shipping, and payment policies. They should be able to answer questions confidently and consistently.
* **Empathy and Active Listening:** Train your team to listen to a customer's complaint fully before responding. Often, customers just want to feel heard. An empathetic ear can turn a frustrated customer into a loyal one.
* **Focus on Resolution, Not Blame:** The goal should always be to find a solution. Instead of saying, ""You should have read the policy,"" try, ""I understand you're frustrated. While our policy is X, let's see what we can do to make this right. How about Y?""
* **Recognize Red Flags:** Train your team to spot potential signs of fraudulent transactions, such as a shipping address that doesn't match the billing address (especially for international orders), unusually large orders, or a flurry of rapid-fire purchases. Empower them to flag these orders for manual review before fulfillment.

# Conclusion: Turning Risk into Your Greatest Strength

Chargebacks are an unfortunate cost of doing business, but they don‚Äôt have to be a constant drain on your resources and morale. By shifting your mindset from reactive defense to proactive protection, you can build a formidable chargeback shield around your small business.

Your policies are more than just fine print; they are the framework for a clear, honest, and trustworthy relationship with your customers. A well-defined payment policy, supported by transparent rules for returns, shipping, and services, sets clear expectations for everyone involved. It reduces confusion, minimizes frustration, and builds the kind of customer confidence that leads to repeat business, not disputes.

The risk of a chargeback is real, but the reward for being prepared is immense. It‚Äôs the reward of financial stability, of peace of mind, and of the confidence that comes from knowing you‚Äôve built your business on a solid, defensible foundation. Now go fortify your shield.

1mta8yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Straycats/comments/1mta8yn/should_my_roomate_let_her_feral_cat_back_outside/,Should my roomate let her feral cat back outside?,"Hi all ‚Äî I‚Äôve been living with my roommate for about 3 months. We met in class and decided to live together mainly to save on rent during our summer internships, and we plan to stay roommates through the fall semester. She‚Äôs a good roommate overall ‚Äî except for her cat Squeegee.

Before we moved in, she asked if she could bring her cat. I initially said no because I‚Äôm allergic, but she insisted he was hypoallergenic and excited to meet me, so I didn‚Äôt push back (my mistake).

The cat has been an issue since day one: he immediately peed everywhere and scratched the coffee table, so she started keeping him in her bedroom. The problem now is that he howls all night. When she‚Äôs not home, he screams constantly, which makes it hard when I‚Äôm on calls. He also randomly hisses and lunges at me even though I avoid him ‚Äî he was feral and my roommate insists on keeping him indoors even though he clearly wants to go outside.

She loves him but I feel like she does what¬†*she*¬†wants with him (puts boots on him, cuddles him even when he scratches her) rather than what‚Äôs actually good for him. Honestly, I think he‚Äôd be happier as a barn/outdoor cat ‚Äî he‚Äôs still basically feral, plus he‚Äôs overweight because she overfeeds him.

At this point he‚Äôs peeing around the apartment even during the day. She cleans it up but it still smells like pee and litter all the time. I don‚Äôt blame the cat, but it‚Äôs really affecting my quality of life. I don‚Äôt want to overstep or make her send him away, but I‚Äôm also stuck living with this demon cat until December and I don‚Äôt know what else to do. (We renting in for the summer-fall semester and housing is pain so neither of us really want to move out, plus she's a good roommate apart from Squeegee) 

Any advice on how to deal with this without crossing a line would be appreciated. Also ‚Äî is it actually ethical to keep a  feral cat inside like this? Or am I overthinking it? She is constantly with the cat when she's home, and sets up treat mazes and tries to play with him but he lunges and scratches, she says he's just playing but in my opinion he's telling her to LEAVE HIM ALONE AND LET HIM OUTSIDE. I've brought up putting and AirTag on him and letting him roam like he used to and she said he would likely die within the week (we live by no major road, biggest wildlife is a raccoon) I get having a cat that was born indoors and keeping it that way because it's safer, but this is a feral cat who I think might be miserable. Any answers are helpful and since this not my pet I can't rehome or else I'd have Squeegee living it up in a barn or something, im honesty clueless about cats (I've only had dogs and rodents) and just want to help him for both our sakes lol.t 

(For clarity: I would¬†*never*¬†physically discipline him ‚Äî I just use a firm voice or try to redirect.

Watch Me Win, Alpha

Everyone thought I was the perfect Luna.
Even Ethan believed I'd never fight back.
So when he brought another woman into our territory, I smiled.
I handed him a folder and watched him sign his name without reading it.
He didn't know he was signing our divorce.
He didn't know his Luna made a deal with his mother, secretly moving out of his life.
Let him keep the mistress.
I'll take back my freedom.
And wait to see his face when he knows the truth.
Chapter 1
Olivia‚Äôs POV
May 8, 2023, my Alpha Mate, Ethan Hawthorne brought his mistress to our pack, and I decided to deceive him into divoring me.
Standing in front of his office, I took a deep breath, knocked on and stepped inside.
The polished wood door swung closed behind me with a soft click.
I clutched the file in my hands , forcing a mechanical smile to my lips as I approached his desk. Ethan didn‚Äôt glance up. His focus remained on the laptop screen.
‚ÄúAre you busy?‚Äù I asked, my voice even, polite.
He looked up, his gray eyes meeting mine without any flicker of warmth.
‚ÄúA bit,‚Äù he said, voice low and rough. He leaned back in his chair. I placed the folder on his desk, already flipping to the marked pages where his signature was needed.
‚ÄúJust a few spots to sign.‚Äù
Without reading, he picked up the pen lying next to his laptop and began to sign, page after page, his hand moving automatically, his gaze occasionally drifting back to his screen.
I watched silently. Ethan looked‚Ä¶worn out. His usually sharp grey eyes were dull, and there were deep shadows under them. He had just come back from London after two weeks at the Annual Alpha Conference ‚Äî a gathering of pack leaders across the globe.
But he hadn‚Äôt come back alone.
My wolf Yve stirred uneasily inside me.‚ÄòHe reeks of her.‚ÄôI pushed her down gently. There was no point in flaring up.Not when the papers he had just signed held the ending we both needed.
When he was finished, he clicked the pen closed and slid it across the table toward me.
‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said, sliding the documents back into my folder.
I paused, hesitated, then asked, ‚ÄúWill you be home for dinner tonight?‚Äù
Predictably, Ethan shook his head. ‚ÄúGot some things to wrap up here. Don‚Äôt wait.‚Äù
I nodded, plastering the same empty smile across my face. ‚ÄúGot it. See you around, Alpha,‚Äù I said, forcing my voice to sound like any other obedient wolf under his rule‚Äînot like the Luna and fated mate he seemed to have regretted claiming.‚Äù
I turned away, letting my smile fade once my back was to him.
My heels clicked softly against the hardwood floor as I walked toward the door.The air shifted slightly when I passed the annex lounge, and Yve immediately bristled.
‚ÄòSmell.‚ÄôSweet vanilla perfume ‚Äî too sweet.I glanced sideways without thinking, my enhanced senses sharpening the image beyond what human eyes would see.
Half a box of artisanal pastries sat abandoned on the low glass table. A lipstick-smeared coffee cup beside it. And near the plush lounge chair, a black high-heeled shoe.
Yve snarled deep within me, the sound more a vibration across my bones than a true noise.‚ÄòHe brought her here. Here. Not just to London. To our den. Our Pack. He stains our space.‚Äô
My throat tightened painfully.
My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting right on top of it as I turned on my heel and head back, away from this awful place that made me feel disgusted.
By the time I got back to my office, exhaustion hit me hard. I dropped into my chair, not even bothering to turn on the lights.
Slowly, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the lowest drawer‚Äîthe very document Ethan had just unknowingly signed.
My fingers brushed over his perfect signature.
Firm. Bold. Unwavering.
Just like the way he had pledged himself to me during the mating ceremony years ago. Back then, Ethan had been so firm, so sure. He looked at me like I was his whole world. I had believed it, like a fool.
That familiar scent I sniffed earlier‚ÄîI knew exactly who it belonged to. I‚Äôm smarter than this. I should‚Äôve seen it coming.
I could still feel the phantom brush of his lips against the mark he placed on my neck.
I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. I could almost hear Ethan‚Äôs mother Amelia‚Äôs voice again‚Äî calm, cold, and cutting. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be naive, Olivia. Men‚Äîeven Alphas‚Äîalways want more. They don‚Äôt stay faithful.‚Äù
A bitter laugh escaped my lips. ‚ÄúYou were always spot on, Amelia,‚Äù I muttered.
I realized then that I had been wrong. So, so wrong.
Not only had Ethan cheated, but he had taken his mistress to our office.
‚ÄòWe deserve better‚Äô, Yve whispered.
‚ÄòWe do‚Äô, I agreed.
Steeling myself, I picked up my phone, snapped a clear photo of the signed divorce agreement, and attached it to a new message.
To: Amelia HawthroneSubject: Agreement CompleteMessage: Ethan has signed, as per our understanding.
I hit send without hesitation.
The previous week, Amelia had approached me in private.If I agreed to file for divorce quietly, without confronting Ethan or exposing the affair publicly, she would ensure a settlement of $150 million transferred discreetly to my personal accounts.
In the world of packs and politics, image was everything. An Alpha embroiled in a public scandal would weaken the Hawthrone Pack‚Äôs standing ‚Äî something Amelia would never allow.
Neither would I, truthfully. No matter how broken Ethan had left me, I would not humiliate myself by causing a spectacle.
I had my dignity.
After a month ‚Äî the grace period to finalize everything ‚Äî Ethan would be free.And so would I.
I let out a slow breath, settling into my chair. That‚Äôs when a knock came at the door.
‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù I said.
Ethan‚Äôs beta, Reed stepped inside, carrying a small, elegant box in both hands.
‚ÄúLuna Olivia,‚Äù he said formally, not quite meeting my eyes. ‚ÄúAlpha Ethan asked me to deliver this to you. He bought it for you during his trip to London.‚Äù
Reed placed the box on my desk and I flipped the lid open.
Inside, nestled on deep blue velvet, was a gleaming diamond set ‚Äî necklace, earrings, bracelet. The same set I had seen in a photo...on her.
Disgust crawled up my throat.
‚ÄúAlpha Ethan mentioned he... he picked it out personally. Wanted something special for you.‚Äù Reed added quickly, like the words might make it hurt less.
I forced a smile, tucking the box back into my desk drawer like it meant nothing.
‚ÄúHow thoughtful of him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEven with his busy schedule and all‚Äù I said lightly, my tone dripping with sarcasm.
Reed flinched slightly. ‚ÄúI should get back,‚Äù He was slipping out, leaving the door swinging shut behind him with a soft thud.
My eyes dropped back to the jewelry sitting on my desk, gleaming under the harsh office lights.My stomach twisted in disgust.
Without wasting another second, I snapped a photo of it and forwarded it to a second-hand luxury dealer.Me: Donate the full amount to the werewolf orphanage fund.
I shut the box with a click, wiping my hands like I‚Äôd just handled garbage. Because, honestly, that‚Äôs what it felt like.
By five in the evening, I was wrapping up, gathering my things, and heading to the parking lot.The day had drained me, but it was the kind of exhaustion that sat deeper than muscles or bones.
As I stepped outside, the wind shifted, carrying a familiar scent.Leather. Musk. Vanilla.
My eyes narrowed instinctively.
That‚Äôs when I spotted Ethan‚Äôs car, parked near the exit.
Through the window, I caught a glimpse‚ÄîEthan, sitting in the back seat.
And right beside him, a vibrant blonde, laughing like she didn‚Äôt have a care in the world.
Reed was behind the wheel.
The second he saw me, he slammed on the brakes, hard enough that the car jolted.
For a heartbeat, everything went still.
My eyes locked with Ethan‚Äôs through the glass.
Chapter 2
Olivia‚Äôs POV
I recognized the blonde girl sitting close to Ethan ‚Äî it was Chole Windsor, the daughter of the Alpha of the second-largest pack in the United States.
She didn‚Äôt even pretend to be subtle. Her eyes found mine across the lot, but she made no move to step away from Ethan. Instead, she draped her arms over his shoulders, leaned in, and whispered something in his ear. He didn‚Äôt stop her.
I looked away. Got into my car, turned the engine, and drove off without sparing them a second glance.
I hadn‚Äôt been home for long. After slipping off my shoes at the entrance, I made my way upstairs to the walk-in closet, the quiet of the pack house settling around me.
I was standing in front of the wardrobe, picking out a necklace ‚Äî something simple to go with tomorrow‚Äôs blazer ‚Äî when I heard a car pull into the gravel driveway outside.
I didn‚Äôt need to look to know who it was.
A moment later, I smelled someone behind me.Ethan.
I didn‚Äôt turn around. Just clasped the necklace and set it back in its place.
‚ÄúAre you upset?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúObviously,‚Äù I said, still not looking at him. ‚ÄúYou should be careful next time.‚Äù
He didn‚Äôt respond right away. I heard him exhale through his nose. ‚ÄúThe Windsor pack‚Äôs Alpha wants to collaborate with us. I‚Äôve been talking to Felix, their eldest Alpha-in-line. Chole is his sister.‚Äù
I nodded slightly and turned to face him. ‚ÄúSo to secure the alliance, it‚Äôs necessary to wrap your arms around his sister in public?‚Äù
His jaw flexed. He didn‚Äôt answer immediately. For a moment, he just looked at me like he didn‚Äôt expect to be questioned. Then his voice hardened.
‚ÄúI'm trying to explain, Olivia. Watch your tone when speaking to your Alpha.‚Äù
I stared at him for a second.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to explain anything to me,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre tired of me and ready to name someone else as Luna, say so. I‚Äôll leave.‚Äù
His face darkened. ‚ÄúWhat did you just say?‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúI said we can get a divorce and break the bond.‚Äù
I stepped past him, but he grabbed my arm. His hand shot up to my chin, gripping it just enough to hold me still without bruising.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever say that again,‚Äù he said, voice low.
I didn‚Äôt respond. Just met his eyes for a beat too long before pulling away.
But inside, I already knew ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt saying it for effect.
I‚Äôd been thinking about divorce for weeks. Preparing for it in quiet ways. I didn‚Äôt want him anymore.
Ethan stayed home that night. Sat in the Alpha‚Äôs private office most of the evening, didn‚Äôt eat dinner. It was well past midnight when he finally got a phone call that made him leave. I wasn‚Äôt close enough to hear everything, but I caught a woman‚Äôs voice on the other end ‚Äî crying.
The next morning, my phone lit up with a message from my friend Ava ‚Äî a lawyer. She had sent me a screenshot of Chole‚Äôs latest post.
It was a photo taken at sunrise, from the top of some mountain trail. Two hands clasped together, fingers interlocked.The caption read: ‚ÄúEnjoy the sunrise, feel your heartbeat.‚Äù
I stared at the photo.
One of those hands was Ethan‚Äôs. I‚Äôd know that scar near his thumb anywhere.
I sat holding my mug for so long the water went cold. Only when I set it down did it make a sound.
The following days, Ethan didn‚Äôt return home.
At work, we saw each other only during meetings. He sat at the head of the table, and I stayed on the side with the executives. We barely made eye contact. I didn‚Äôt go upstairs to his office, and he didn‚Äôt come down to mine.
In the evenings, I started browsing house listings ‚Äî somewhere small, outside the city. I also started clearing out the closet. Anniversary gifts. Jewelry. Even the wedding ring. All of it went to resell platforms or donation. They didn‚Äôt mean anything to me anymore.
One evening around 11 p.m., Luna Kate from SilverFang pack texted me out of the blue, inviting me to join her at a club. We were not very familiar‚ÄîI'd only met her a few times when I attended the Pack Summit with Ethan. She was very good at greeting anyone with her fake smile. Her Alpha husband was frequently caught up in scandals, and now she started to be a social butterfly as well.
I almost said no. But then I remembered ‚Äî if I really left the Hawthorne Group, I‚Äôd have to build something on my own. Might as well start moving.
‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I texted back.
When I got to the Moonfell, Kate met me near the entrance. She linked her arm through mine like we were best friends.
‚ÄúGlad to see you Olivia,‚Äù she kissed my face. No one but our inner circle knew Ethan and I were married. They always called me Olivia and thought we were just a rumored couple with mate bond.
‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù I tried to fake smile.
She led me upstairs and into a large room that was divided by a decorative wooden screen.
There were people on the other side ‚Äî laughing, drinking, talking loud ‚Äî but Kate brought me to this side, quieter, with just one woman sitting alone. I recognized her vaguely. Mate of someone in Ethan‚Äôs circle. She smiled at me ‚Äî tight, awkward.
I took off my coat, sat down, and Kate disappeared a moment later.
I picked up a drink, sipped it once, and then I heard it.
My name.
From the other side of the screen.
‚ÄúShe hasn‚Äôt been seen with Alpha Ethan much lately, huh?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, of course not. He takes Chole Windsor everywhere now.‚Äù
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the daughter of the second biggest Pack Alpha in the country. Obviously, she‚Äôs a better fit. Makes the Pack look stronger.‚Äù
‚ÄúStill, Olivia and Alpha Ethan were together what ‚Äî eight years? He‚Äôs probably tired of her even though they are mates.‚Äù
There was a pause. Then a chuckle.‚ÄúShame. She wasted her best years. I‚Äôd still take a go at her, though.‚Äù
The cup froze in my hand.
I recognized the voices. Two of them belonged to the sons of the Gamma and Delta.
The woman beside me shifted uncomfortably.
I stood up. She looked startled, maybe thinking I was going to leave.
Instead, I cleared my throat, picked up my drink, and stepped around the screen.
The laughter faded when they saw me.
I leaned casually against the edge of the divider, my drink in hand. I looked at the one who‚Äôd spoken last.
‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it a bit unfair?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou make it sound like I‚Äôve been living off him.‚Äù
They blinked.
I took a sip.
‚ÄúEthan was a virgin before we got together. So if I‚Äôve been using him to satisfy my needs for eight years without paying ‚Äî sounds like I got the better deal, doesn‚Äôt it?
Silence. The whole room had gone still.
Most of them just stared‚Äî and then widened when they looked at someone behind me.
Chapter 3
Olivia‚Äôs POV
I smelled it. I turned around, and there he was.
Alpha Ethan.
I glanced at him, then looked past him to the low velvet sofa behind. Chole Windsor sat there, legs crossed, glass in hand.
Her smile was gone. The way she stared at me ‚Äîher eyes flashing with the territorial aggression of a she-wolf ready to defend her claim ‚Äî made it clear she would've ripped my throat out if she could get away with it.
That‚Äôs when it clicked.
This wasn‚Äôt some coincidence. They were here together. Chole, Ethan, and their usual circle ‚Äî people I once thought of as allies. This was their private little gathering. From the way they talked earlier, it clearly wasn‚Äôt their first. They didn‚Äôt even care to hide their relationship. Maybe they never had.
Ethan walked toward me.
Behind him, the group scrambled back to life. One of them stepped forward quickly. ‚ÄúOlivia, we were just messing around‚Äînone of it was serious. We were just talking nonsense.‚Äù
Another added, ‚ÄúReally sorry. We didn‚Äôt mean anything by it.‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt respond.
Ethan reached for my wrist.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù he said, already trying to pull me out of the room.
I didn‚Äôt fight.
Instead, I grabbed my drink and threw it in his face, a clear challenge in the presence of his pack.
The room fell into complete silence again. Someone gasped. I could hear the ice clink against his cheek as the liquid ran down his jawline.
I smiled faintly, ‚ÄúPlease, Alpha, continue enjoying yourself with your beloved. I won‚Äôt interrupt again.‚Äù
Then I lowered my head, tried to pull my hand back from his.
His grip only tightened.
His face had gone dark. Without another word, he bent down, grabbed me, and threw me over his shoulder like a sack.
I kicked instinctively. ‚ÄúEthan‚Äîput me down!‚Äù
He didn‚Äôt respond.
We walked into the hallway, and I struggled on his back, but Ethan didn‚Äôt loosen his grip.The elevator had just arrived on the floor. As he stepped inside and turned around, my upside-down view caught a pair of polished black leather shoes. Then black suit pants, long legs, and pale hands ‚Äî each finger slender, the joints sharp and defined.
The air felt still. Quiet but awkward.
Ethan walked out of the elevator just as I looked up ‚Äî and met a pair of deep, steady eyes.
Sharp and captivating.
They held mine for a second too long. I looked away, suddenly embarrassed to be seen like that. Slung over Ethan‚Äôs shoulder like some helpless object.
Suddenly, Yve stirred inside me, her instincts sharpening, the primal awareness of another strong wolf nearby sparking her curiosity.
I didn‚Äôt know why I felt that way. But I didn‚Äôt like it. It unsettled me.
Ethan dragged me out of the club and down the steps to his car. He opened the back door, tossed me in, and climbed in himself.
My head spun. Being carried upside down and then thrown like that.
He grabbed a wet wipe from the glove compartment and began wiping his face silently.
Then he finally spoke. ‚ÄúWhy were you there? You came to catch me, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù
As he wiped his cheek, I noticed something just behind the tissue box.
A foil wrapper ‚Äî gold, neatly tucked behind the tissue box.
A condom.
The sight of it made my stomach turn. I looked away immediately and reached for the door handle.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not staying in this car,‚Äù I said.
He pulled me back roughly. ‚ÄúWhere do you think you‚Äôre going?‚Äù
‚ÄúHome,‚Äù I said, my breathing uneven. ‚ÄúI want to go home.‚Äù
‚ÄúStop making trouble, Olivia. My patience is running out.‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt answer. Just sat there, breathing hard.
‚ÄúHarold!‚Äù Ethan called out toward the club. ‚ÄúDrive.‚Äù
Harold came out a minute later, nodded, and got into the front seat.
The ride was silent. I stayed pressed against the farthest side of the car, arms crossed, staring out the window.
By the time we reached the house, I opened the door and got out before the engine had fully stopped.
Inside, I went straight to the kitchen and poured a full glass of ice water. I drank all of it in one go.
Only then did I feel something close to normal.
When I walked back out, Ethan was sitting in the living room. I didn‚Äôt ask why.
I sat down across from him.
It was quiet for a while. Then he said, ‚ÄúI was there to talk business. A new project.‚Äù
I said nothing.
‚ÄúYou showing up and making a scene like that ‚Äî it embarrassed me.‚Äù
He kept going. ‚ÄúYou looked ridiculous. Screaming, throwing drinks. Like a jealous shrew.‚Äù
I stared at him.
He looked back at me, like he expected me to deny it.
‚ÄúIs that all?‚Äù I asked.
His brows drew together. ‚ÄúIf you want our relationship to work, you need to stop being paranoid all the time. I don‚Äôt have time for your insane suspicions.‚Äù
I nodded. ‚ÄúGot it. Anything else?‚Äù
He stared at me. ‚ÄúDo you know how annoying you are right now?‚Äù
I stood up slowly.
He won‚Äôt be annoyed much longer.
I went upstairs, changed into pajamas, and got into bed without another word.
He came up about an hour later and found me already asleep.
After showering, he got into bed quietly. I turned my back to him and inched closer to the edge, making sure our bodies wouldn‚Äôt touch.
That didn‚Äôt stop him.
He hugged me from behind and yanked me back into his arms, rough and without a word. He was tall, his Alpha strength undeniable, the raw power of a pack leader. With barely any effort, he held me in place, his grip unyielding, making it clear that resisting would be pointless.
I spent the night stiffly, barely moving.
By morning, I hadn‚Äôt slept at all. I went downstairs and made breakfast for myself ‚Äî toast, boiled eggs, a glass of milk. I sat alone at the dining table and started eating in silence.
Ethan came down a little while later, dressed for work. He glanced toward me but didn‚Äôt say anything at first. He walked halfway to the door, then stopped. A few seconds passed before he turned around and walked over.
He leaned in close to my ear.
‚ÄúThis weekend,‚Äù he said gently, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go out to sea. Just the two of us. Clear our heads a little.‚Äù
I took a sip of milk and replied without looking at him. ‚ÄúHmm.‚Äù
That was it.
On Friday, he broke the promise.Said he had to fly to Washington for a project. An urgent meeting, supposedly.
I wasn‚Äôt surprised. I didn‚Äôt feel anything ‚Äî no disappointment, no anger. Just nothing.
Maybe he hasn‚Äôt noticed we haven‚Äôt shared a meal in weeks. We don‚Äôt talk. We don‚Äôt go anywhere. We don‚Äôt spend time like people in a marriage ‚Äî not even like people who live under the same roof.
He says divorce is out of the question, but I already feel like someone who doesn‚Äôt exist to him.
If I disappeared tomorrow, I genuinely doubt he would even notice.
Over the weekend, I started moving books out of the study. Stacked them into a suitcase and took them to my new apartment. The place was smaller. Simpler. But it felt like mine.
While I was organizing the shelf, my phone rang.
Melina.
I hesitated, then picked up. ‚ÄúHello, Luna Melina.‚Äù Ever since I married his son eight years ago, she still asks me to call her luna.
She snorted arrogantly. ‚ÄúCome over now. We need to put down in writing what we discussed earlier.‚Äù
I paused. ‚ÄúIs that really necessary?‚Äù
She didn‚Äôt hesitate. ‚ÄúIf I say so.‚Äù
""Fine. I'll go back this afternoon,"" I answered.
Yet, she wasn't satisfied. ""Come back at noon.""
Chapter 4
Olivia‚Äôs POV
I arrived atHawthorne Manoraround 11 AM.
As I approached the main entrance, a sweet, overly cheerful voice drifted out through the partially open windows.
‚ÄúYay! I won again!‚Äù The girl‚Äôs tone was playful, but there was a flirtatious edge to it, the kind meant to tease a lover. ‚ÄúAre you letting me win on purpose, Ethan?‚Äù
I paused, my hand hovering over the door handle. I didn‚Äôt need to see her to know who it was.
Chole Windsor.
I realized the real purpose of Melina, she wanted to humiliated me.
I took a slow breath, letting Yve‚Äôs quiet growl settle in my chest, then pushed open the door and stepped inside.
Ethan was in the living room, his head turning sharply when he caught sight of me. For a moment, his eyes flickered with surprise, quickly masked by a flash of annoyance. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù
I walked in, slipping my sunglasses off and tucking them into the pocket of my loose white T-shirt. I hadn‚Äôt bothered with makeup today, just jeans and a comfortable shirt. I met his eyes,‚ÄúYour mom didn‚Äôt tel you? She called me.‚Äù I continued, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt know you were back from London so soon. Or are you a magician now, managing to be in two places at once?‚Äù
His jaw tightened, a flicker of guilt flashing in his eyes. He didn‚Äôt respond.
Before he could recover, Chole stood up from the plush velvet sofa. She brushed an invisible speck of dust off her thigh, showing off her perfectly manicured fingers.
‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she extened her hand, stepping closer with a bright smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Chole Windsor. It‚Äôs nice to meet you.‚Äù
I looked at her outstretched hand for a second, then deliberately ignored her.
Melina entered the room. She wore a tailored black dress, her hair swept back in a flawless chignon, a perfect image of power and control. Her eyes moved over me briefly before settling on Chole.
‚ÄúChole, darling,‚Äù she said, taking Chole‚Äôs hand in both of hers,‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre having a good time today. Make yourself at home. This is your house too.‚Äù
I felt a muscle in my jaw tighten, but I kept my face neutral.
Melina‚Äôs eyes flicked to me, her expression cooling instantly.‚ÄúAh, Olivia. You‚Äôre here.‚Äù
She turned back to Chole, her tone still warm.‚ÄúThis is Ms. Hawthorne, the manager of the Hawthorne Group. She‚Äôs here on business.‚Äù
It took every ounce of self-control not to roll my eyes. She made it sound like I was just another employee, someone here to deliver a report, not the Luna of the pack or her son‚Äôs wife. It was a subtle dismissal, a deliberate way to tell Chole that I was no threat.
I ignored her, my eyes drifting back to Ethan. He didn‚Äôt even try to defend my position.
‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you say we had business to discuss? Let‚Äôs get it over with.‚Äù
Melina‚Äôs smile tightened slightly.‚ÄúWe can discuss it another day. You‚Äôre here now, so why not join us for a meal?‚Äù
I exhaled slowly, already tired of this charade.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here for a meal, Melina. I have other things to do.‚ÄùI turned to leave, my back already to them.
Her voice sharpened,‚ÄúI am still the pack luna, Olivia, and I have asked you politely to stay. What is this attitude of yours? No manners at all.‚Äù
I paused, my hand stilling on the back of a leather chair. I turned slowly, meeting her icy stare with one of my own.‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll stay for a meal.‚ÄùI met her gaze without blinking.‚ÄúJust make sure you don‚Äôt regret it.‚Äù
Chole, sensing the tension, quickly tried to lighten the atmosphere,‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs perfect. I was just telling Ethan how much I enjoyed winning our little game of Silver Moon Toss earlier. I‚Äôd love to keep playing.‚Äù
I glanced at the balcony where a polishedSilver Moon Tosstarget stood, several delicate gold rings stacked neatly beside it. I hadn‚Äôt even noticed it before. Clearly, it was something new ‚Äî probably Chole‚Äôs idea.
Silver Moon Tosswas a light social competition often played atwerewolf gatherings. The rules were simple ‚Äî players took turns tossing three golden rings, trying to encircle the movingMoon Pillarfive meters away. It required precision and rhythm, often used to showcase coordination between couples.
Chole‚Äôs eyes lit up when she saw me looking at the ring toss setup.‚ÄúOh, Olivia, do you know how to playSilver Moon Toss?‚Äù
I met her gaze, catching the hint of challenge behind her bright smile.‚ÄúOnly a little,‚ÄùI replied, letting my eyes linger on her for a beat.‚ÄúWanna play?‚Äù
Ethan‚Äôs jaw tightening as he shot me a warning look.
‚ÄúOf course. Shall I go first, or would you like the honor?‚Äù Chole adjusted one of the gold rings on the table, her confidence flaring.
‚ÄúGo ahead. I‚Äôll watch.‚Äù I stepped back, casually folding my arms.
Chole‚Äôs smile widened, clearly pleased with herself. She stepped into position, her posture perfect, each movement precise. She took a steadying breath, then flicked her wrist. The golden ring sliced through the air, narrowly missing the Moon Pillar, landing just a few centimeters off.
She turned back to me,‚ÄúAlmost nailed it.‚Äù
Behind her, Melina‚Äôs eyes followed the ring,‚ÄúChole. So graceful.‚Äù
Chole gave a appreciative nod, clearly loving the praise.
I didn‚Äôt bother with any of the theatrics. I stepped forward, picked up a ring, and tossed it without much thought. The ring cut through the air cleanly, glinting in the sunlight before slipping perfectly around the Moon Pillar with a clear, satisfying clink.
Chole‚Äôs smile froze for a second, her fingers tightening around the ring she still held. She forced a thin, strained smile.‚ÄúLucky shot.‚Äù
I let a careless smile spread across my lips, leaning back slightly.‚ÄúMaybe.‚ÄùI shrugged,‚ÄúLast time I played this was at the Alpha Foundation dinner with Ethan.‚Äù
The remark hit its mark. Chole‚Äôs face tensed, her grip on the ring tightening as she prepared for the next throw.
Melina stepped in quickly,‚ÄúDear, it‚Äôs just a game. The important thing is to have fun.‚Äù
I shrugged, stepping back.‚ÄúOf course. But some people get carried away too easily.‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt miss the way Melina‚Äôs eyes flicked to Ethan, a silent accusation in them.
In the next few rounds, I almost hit every ring, each one sliding smoothly around theMoon Pillarwith a clear, satisfying clink. Meanwhile, Chole‚Äôs throws grew increasingly off-target, her rings clattering against the base or falling short entirely.
I noticed the slight tremble in her fingers as she reached for another ring, her forced smile tightening with every miss, her eyes flashing with barely concealed frustration.
Melina‚Äôs expression grew more strained with each missed attempt, her jaw clenching tighter every time I hit my mark. She glanced at Ethan, as if hoping for some intervention, but he remained silent.
I stepped back, dusted my hands lightly, then walked to the nearby sofa. I set my final ring down on the polished side table, folding my hands neatly in my lap, my eyes meeting theirs without flinching.
‚ÄúWant to keep playing?‚ÄùI asked, my tone light, almost bored.
Chole‚Äôs hand curled tightly around the last ring, her knuckles turning pale, lips pressed into a thin, strained line.
Melina shot me a sharp, furious look, her eyes narrowing into thin, dangerous slits.
Chapter 5
Olivia‚Äôs POV
‚ÄúCome on, one more,‚ÄùChole said, trying to hide the frustration in her eyes.‚ÄúI‚Äôm just getting warmed up.‚Äù
I glanced at her, then at Ethan, who still hadn‚Äôt said a word. Melina watched from the side, clearly annoyed but not stepping in.
‚ÄúSure,‚ÄùI replied, picking up another ring, my tone casual.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep going.‚Äù
We kept playing. I hit the pillar again. And again. Chole‚Äôs throws grew wilder, her aim less precise, her confidence visibly cracking. Melina‚Äôs eyes darted between us, her polished exterior slipping as her face twisted into an increasingly sour expression. She glanced at Ethan, clearly expecting him to intervene, but he just stood there.
I picked up my final ring, tossed it with a casual flick of my wrist, and it spun neatly around theMoon Pillaronce more.
Chole‚Äôs forced smile finally shattered. Her eyes filled with tears, and a small, broken sound escaped her throat. She clutched the last ring tightly, her fingers shaking, then let it clatter to the ground as she stumbled toward Ethan.
Ethan stepped forward, his face hard, eyes cold. He snatched the gold ring from my hand, his jaw clenched.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough,‚Äù he said, his voice low but sharp.
Chole threw herself into his arms, her shoulders shaking as she buried her face in his chest. Ethan‚Äôs expression softened, his arm coming up to hold her gently, fingers stroking her back in slow, comforting circles. Melina quickly stepped in, wrapping an arm around Chole, whispering something I couldn‚Äôt hear.
‚ÄúReally, Olivia?‚ÄùMelina‚Äôs eyes snapped to me, sharp and furious.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a game. Was it necessary to take it so seriously?‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt respond, just slowly stepped back, setting my last ring down on the side table.
Melina‚Äôs eyes bored into me,‚ÄúYou come from an ordinary family. You think being competitive is the only way to gain respect?‚Äù
Her words hit like a slap.
I glanced at Ethan, expecting... what? Defense? Support? But his eyes were distant, his face like a faded photograph, all the vibrance I once admired now washed out and cold.
Forget it. There are only twenty days left. I shouldn‚Äôt care.
I stood up, ready to leave, my pulse still racing.
‚ÄúStop, you are hurting us,‚Äù Yve‚Äôs voice echoed in my mind.
I glanced down at my hand, my fingers curled so tightly that my nails had broken the skin. I hadn‚Äôt even noticed.
Then, I turned on my heel and walked toward the door.
‚ÄúOlivia‚Äî‚ÄùEthan‚Äôs voice followed me, sharp and angry.
I didn‚Äôt stop.
I pushed through the grand double doors of theHawthorne Manor and got into my car, my chest heaving as I gripped the steering wheel.
My phone buzzed beside me. Ethan. I ignored it and finally, I blocked his number.
My hands still shook as I pulled out onto the road, the tires crunching against the gravel as I sped away from the mansion.
I reached for my phone, typing out a message to Melina with one hand.
‚Äú$250 million. Not a penny less. Or I‚Äôll make sure you and your family pay the price.‚Äù
I hit send without hesitation, tossing the phone onto the passenger seat, my pulse still racing.
The sky had grown darker, thick gray clouds rolling in, the first few drops of rain splattering against my windshield.
Suddenly, a flash of yellow blurred past my peripheral vision, followed by the sharp, whining roar of a motorcycle engine.
A red bike cut in front of my car, swerving wildly, its rider dressed in dark leather, helmet glinting with water droplets.
I slammed on the brakes, my body jolting forward, the seatbelt cutting into my shoulder as my tires screeched against the wet asphalt.
‚ÄúCareful!‚ÄùYve‚Äôs voice snapped in my head.
Before I could fully process what happened, a deafening crash shook my car. My head slammed into the steering wheel, a sharp, hot pain exploding behind my eyes.
I groaned, blinking rapidly as my vision blurred, red and dark, the world spinning slightly.
Immediately, I grabbed a tissue from the console, pressing it against my temple, wiping away the blood that blurred my vision.
Through the cracked windshield, I saw the red motorcycle disappearing into the distance. Then I checked my rear view mirror to find a black Maybach that had rear-ended me. Its front bumper was dented, the polished surface marred by the impact.
Before I could gather my thoughts, a firm knock sounded against my window.
A man in his forties, dressed in a crisp black suit, glasses perched on his nose, stood beside my car, a black umbrella in one hand, his expression polite but concerned.
I rolled down the window, wincing as the motion sent another wave of pain through my skull.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm terribly sorry, ma‚Äôam,‚Äùhe said, his voice calm and steady.‚ÄúI rear-ended your car. I‚Äôll take full responsibility.‚Äù
I caught the faint scent of another wolf on him ‚Äî not a threat, but unfamiliar.
‚ÄúMy boss has some urgent matters to attend to,‚Äùhe continued, nodding toward the back seat. I caught a glimpse of a tall, broad-shouldered figure in a dark suit, sunglasses hiding his eyes, his posture relaxed but radiating a quiet, dangerous energy.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Mike,‚Äù the man added, adjusting his glasses. ‚ÄúCan we exchange numbers? I‚Äôll make sure all your expenses are covered.‚Äù
I took a deep breath, still feeling the sting at my temple. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd prefer to leave this to the police,‚Äù I replied, trying to keep my voice steady. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had enough surprises for one day.‚Äù
I pushed open the car door and stepped out, my shoes splashing in the shallow puddles forming on the wet road. I walked to the back of my car, my heart sinking when I saw the dent. The rear bumper was crumpled, the paint scraped off, and the tail light cracked. I frowned, took a quick photo for the insurance, then pulled out my phone and called the police.
A few minutes later, I heard another car door open. I glanced back, and the man in the back seat of the Maybach stepped out. Mike quickly moved to his side, holding a black umbrella over him, his posture respectful and hurried.
The man straightened, his suit perfectly tailored, sharp creases running down his pant legs, his shoes polished enough to reflect the gray sky. His presence was striking ‚Äî tall, broad-shouldered, and the kind of face that commanded attention even in a crowd.
He took off his sunglasses, revealing deep-set eyes that met mine for a brief second. I felt my heart skip a beat. Something about him seemed... special, though I couldn‚Äôt place it.
I turned to the approaching officer, quickly explaining what had happened.
When I turned back, Mike was standing beside me, holding out a dark suit jacket. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, your shirt is soaked,‚Äù he said politely, eyes slightly averted. ‚ÄúPlease, put this on.‚Äù
I glanced down and felt my face heat up. My white shirt was clinging to my body, rainwater making the thin fabric almost transparent. I nodded and took the jacket from his hands, slipping it on quickly.
It was warm, the lining still carrying the faint heat of the man who had just worn it, along with a subtle, expensive cologne ‚Äî something woody, clean, with a hint of smoke. It made my pulse quicken, and Yve stirred within me, her curiosity flaring.
‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I mumbled, feeling awkward. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wash it and return it to your boss.‚Äù
Mike gave a small smile, shaking his head. ‚ÄúNo need. My boss won‚Äôt mind.‚Äù
I looked up, but the man was already getting back into the Maybach. The door shut with a soft, expensive thud, and the car eased back onto the road, the engine barely making a sound as it disappeared into the rain.
I stood there for a moment, clutching the warm jacket around my shoulders, the lingering scent still teasing my senses, making Yve restless.
Chapter 6
Olivia‚Äôs POV
I sat on the edge of the padded examination table with the faint smell of antiseptic clinging to the air. Healer Rosa gently tilted my chin up, examining the cut on my forehead.
‚ÄúYour temple region took the most damage,‚Äù she said, wiping the area with a damp cloth. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù
I hesitated, not wanting to get into the messy details of the accident. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. Just some reckless driver and bad luck. Yve has already handled most of it. I just came to make sure it heals without a scar.‚Äù
Rosa reached for a small jar on the counter, scooping a bit of herbal salve onto her fingers. ‚ÄúHold still.‚Äù
I closed my eyes, letting the coolness of the cream soothing the faint sting.
The door burst open suddenly, crashing against the wall. Rosa flinched, her hands freezing mid-air.
Ethan stormed in. He took a few quick steps toward us.
Rosa‚Äôs eyes darted between us, her nervous fingers tightening around the jar. I offered her a reassuring nod. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. That‚Äôs my... boss.‚Äù
Ethan centered his focus entirely on me. ‚ÄúIs it serious?‚Äù he demanded.
Rosa straightened, adjusting her glasses. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a superficial wound. Nothing too serious. She‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù
He let out a breath. Rosa gave me theointment, then hurried out of the room.
Ethan stepped aside, but the moment I reached the doorway, he grabbed the small bottle of ointment from my hand. I paused, raising an eyebrow at him.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle this,‚Äù he muttered, tucking the bottle into his coat pocket as if it were some grand gesture of care.
I didn‚Äôt bother stopping him. If he wanted to play the part of the attentive husband, I wasn‚Äôt going to waste my breath arguing.
I pulled out my phone, intending to call a cab, but Ethan snatched the phone from my hand, his grip firm.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù he said, already steering me toward the hospital exit.
‚ÄúHey‚Äî‚Äù I tried to pull my arm back, but his grip tightened.

_____________

Every morning, I had the pleasure of waking up to a man who was straight off the cover of a romance novel.
Literally.
My husband modeled and had become a highly coveted romance hero icon. He had dark good looks from his Italian father, gorgeous blue eyes, a hard-body build, abs you could climb like a ladder and incredible height like a tree.
That also made you want to climb him.
He had tattoos on both arms, and his chest and back were covered. His looks were rugged and had been tagged for MC, mafia and sports romances, but switch up his outfits a bit and he could morph seamlessly into a billionaire businessman or an undercover agent or a firefighter. His chest was sheer perfection and on ninety percent of his covers, he was shirtless.
Basilio was gorgeous, but more than that, he was good hearted, thoughtful and kind. He treated me like I was precious treasure and his attentiveness was the envy of all of my friends.
""Bas, you gotta quit treating Teshi so well,"" my friends' husbands would say. ""My wife is always on my case now with Bas did this and Bas did that for his wife.""
""Why wouldn't you do everything you could to make your wife happy?"" Bas had asked them, perplexed.
I was pretty enough, admittedly not cover-model material, but Bas always made me feel like the most beautiful woman in the world.
""You are,"" he told me simply when I protested his superlative, his eyes sparkling in appreciation. ""Don't argue with me.""
His eyes were already on me when I woke up, so he leaned over and pecked me. ""Good morning, Tesh.""
I snuggled closer to him. ""Good morning. What's on your plate today?""
""I have an online interview as Chase Miles for one hour, then I have a cologne shoot this afternoon and evening.""
Chase Miles was my husband's alter ego. He liked keeping his work life completely separate from his personal life, so when he'd begun modeling, he'd set up Chase Miles as his professional name.
After he asked what my day held, he pulled me out of bed and into the shower with him. First he got me dirty, then he concentrated on cleaning me up. Eventually, he went to his office in our home and I went to mine since I didn't have to be to work until later.
The first thing I did was log into Facebook because my husband wasn't the only one with an alter ego. I'd never told him that I belonged to several FB pages dedicated to pure smut, and I didn't use my real name. For my special groups, I was Smut Seeker10.
I checked out the pages I belonged to, adding about twenty more books to my ever-expanding TBR list, and when I got to the last page, I smiled in surprise. Apparently, Chase Miles was the Hot Guest Guy on the Dirty Girls Who Like 'Em Hot and Raunchy page. The page was dedicated to the men who appeared on the covers of romance novels, so it was a very niche group with a lot of good eye candy.
Bas was scheduled to begin the one hour Q&A in five minutes, and the admin for the page had just dumped a slideshow of every romance cover Chase had done. She'd also included some images of him taken from the internet from various photo shoots he'd done for colognes and underwear and other products.
Oh, this was going to be fun! I'd watched Bas in interviews before and he was charming, witty and very, very engaging. I'd never known him to do a guest spot on any FB pages before so this was new. He also had no idea I was a member of the page.
The admin introduced him, and then told everyone to put their questions in comments and Bas would answer as many as possible in the one hour he had. The admin was taking the questions and making each one an individual post for him to answer.
Q: Chase!! Huge fan! Dying to know since there's never any information on your personal life...are you married?
Yes, he is! To me!!!
Chase: Are you asking because I look miserable or something? No, not married and I have no interest in being tied down.
Um. What? Not married? No interest in being tied down? Bas, the correct answer is yes, I am happily married to the love of my life and have been for two years.
Q: YOU ARE SO HOT! Is it strictly professional with you and the female models you pose with?
Chase: While we're on a shoot, it is 100% professional. We're all there to do a job and that's it. But after we finish and hit the bars, we're so amped up from the shoot that we aren't thinking about being professional. We just let loose and have fun.
If I thought his answer to the marriage question was the worst, this one took my breath away. Did this mean he'd cheated on me when he had to be away overnight for his shoots? He always told me he went back up to his hotel room to unwind after a shoot. Now I was finding out that was a lie? A horrible lie.
Q: If you ever imagined yourself getting married, what would your ideal woman be like?
OK, Bas, time to turn this around. Describe me! Tall, blonde, brown eyes, lots of extra padding, pear-shaped, cute.
Chase: I love, respect and find beauty in all types of women, but if I *have* to describe my ideal woman, then I'm really partial to short, petite brunettes with gorgeous green eyes, a killer smile and dimples. But to get real for a bit, just because that's the fantasy, that doesn't mean you can't find happiness with a different reality.
I was practically gasping for air because someone had obviously reached down my throat and ripped out my lungs. Bas had just described the woman he was engaged to before he met me, right down to the dimples. I'd seen a couple of pictures of them on his IG account when I'd stalked him after we met. Following our second date, he'd deleted them.
""I don't need the past when I have you and a very bright future, Teshi.""
Maybe...maybe Bas was just trying to throw people off track from his real life. But for him to describe his ideal woman in such a detailed way...and it wasn't any description that could be applied to me by any stretch of the imagination.
The questions went on and on.
Q: Do you have any favorite women to pose with?
Chase: Definitely have favorites. There are some models you just ""click"" with on the set, and those shoots produce the hottest cover images because there's no faking the intensity with them. You're portraying a character, but for a brief moment, it feels real and that's when the photographer captures the moment. The authors or publishers recognize that, so it's pretty common to work together often when they see that connection in the pictures.
He'd always told me it was just lighting, angles and acting.
Knowing I'd hate myself for this, I typed in a question. The admin popped it up minutes later.
Q: Have you ever been in love?
Chase: Yes. A long, *dimpled* time ago. Someday, I hope to find that again.
Panic was beginning to set in and my breathing was way too erratic.
Q: Can we reach out to you?
Chase: Absolutely, I love hearing from fans!
And then he gave his Chase Miles email and provided a link to his FB page.
The admin came back, thanking Chase for his time and reminding anyone who lived in the Denver area that Chase would be attending a romance writer's conference and there would be a fundraiser event for a local women's shelter. As part of the fundraiser, a silent auction would be held and a dinner with Chase the night of the event would be one of the prizes.
I knew he had an overnight romance conference where he would be appearing at several authors' tables whose covers he'd been on, but that was the first I knew some woman could bid on a dinner with him and spend one-on-one time with my husband.
I wondered what else my husband did behind my back because I had no idea about any of this. With my mind spinning, unable to process all of his answers, I jerked in surprise when he knocked on my door before popping his head in.
""Hey, sweetheart, I'm heading out for my shoot. It's going to be late since a lot of the shoot is at night.""
""Bas, if I asked you to describe your ideal woman, what would you say?""
He looked confused at the sudden change of subject and the actual question. ""I'm looking right at her. You are my ideal.""
""So, not a short, petite brunette with gorgeous green eyes, a killer smile and dimples?""
His expression changed to wary.
""How about love, Bas? I know you were in love a long, dimpled time ago, but do you still hope to find that again?""
Now my handsome husband was looking extremely concerned.
""Oh, Bas, now you're looking downright miserable. Careful ‚Äì someone might think you're married.""

One thing about Bas was he met issues head on. If I wasn't happy, he boldly waded right into the mess of my anger.
""Tesh,"" Bas said sternly, walking toward me, ""That was my Chase persona talking. I don't ever want the press to discover you, so no way would I admit that I'm married or describe you. You're not for public consumption. You're mine and I won't share you with anyone, and I sure wouldn't let the press get ahold of you.""
""You were describing your ex as your ideal!""
""Yeah. She and I attended some events when we were engaged, back when my modeling career was getting started and people saw us together. To my fans, it seems romantic that I'm still describing her even after we broke up, which gives me an excuse not to be seen with someone else in public. Makes me more in demand to be seen as a tragic figure, pining for a lost love. And it also keeps the press from sniffing around, possibly finding out about you and saying all sorts of nonsense about you.""
""I don't like any of what you said in that interview. You basically said if you can't have the fantasy, you have to settle for reality.""
Bas's eyes flashed angrily. ""No, what I said was just because that's the fantasy, that doesn't mean you can't find happiness with a different reality. That wasn't pointed at you, Tesh. It was pointed at women who look at me, think my looks are the ideal to strive for and then they feel dissatisfied with their real-life men. I've met some men at the romance writers' conventions and every time they all give me the stink eye and tell me how their wives or girlfriends get after them to work out more or just flat-out tell them they wished they looked more like me. That's pretty terrible to be with someone you don't think is absolutely perfect.""
""And what about the not strictly professional comment after a shoot? And having chemistry with the female models? You said you go back to your hotel after shoots!""
""I do go back to the hotel. I talked about chemistry because now the fans are going to go back over my covers and try to figure out if the chemistry was real with each of the ladies I posed with. These are comments specifically made to cause speculation, Tesh. To make Chase's life seem more exciting, to add to the fantasy.""
""I'm not happy with you.""
Bas came over and hugged me even though I didn't hug him back.
""Don't be mad, Tesh. I love you, and you are my ideal woman in every aspect.""
""Were you going to tell me about the dinner auction where you have some intimate dinner with whoever won you in the bidding war?""
He burst out laughing. ""Intimate dinner? Not even close. The twelve of us are being auctioned off for a dinner that takes place during the convention in full view of everyone else having dinner in the hotel ballroom. There will be four of us models at three different tables with the women who win us. So eight of us at a table. Hardly intimate because I wouldn't do that.""
""You have all the answers,"" I griped.
""I have all the answers because all the questions have simple explanations. I need to get going, but Tesh, remember that I love you. We can talk more if you want, but that was Chase answering those questions. Not me. I love you.""
Since I was feeling disgruntled with him, I didn't peck him back, so after my lips proved fruitless, he pressed a peck to my forehead and walked out.
When he got home late that night, I was already asleep in bed, otherwise I would have felt him pull me to him and spoon me. Bas couldn't stand not having me in his arms when he slept.
I popped out of bed an hour earlier than normal since I was meeting one of my favorite clients for a stretch before she had to get on a plane for too many hours to fly to Australia.
""Where you going?"" Bas mumbled. The man was usually awake before I was, so I knew the photo shoot must have gone very late.
""Early client.""
He sat up and stretched and even if I was mad at him, I still enjoyed the sight. But not as much as usual. So take that, Bas!
""I'll be at the studio until about seven. Let's plan on having a late dinner together since I'm leaving for the convention tomorrow. There's a meet and greet tomorrow night, then the convention all day Saturday and the dinner and auction Saturday night. Going to try to fit in a quick coffee with Elsie Sunday morning.""

Bas, by trade, was a tattoo artist for an exclusive studio, which is where he was actually discovered by a new client, Elsie, who worked for a well-known romance publisher. She'd taken one look at the man about to ink her and told him she wanted him for book covers. At first, he'd thought she was messing with him, but he took a chance and met with her, and his modeling career had begun.
He usually modeled once or twice a week -- those book covers had led to other opportunities -- and he worked his free days at the tattoo studio. He specialized in fine line tattoos and had a wait list, which meant whenever he was available, the clients flocked to him and his wait list grew. He always looked at modeling realistically and knew the years he could model would be limited, so he felt it was important to keep working as a tattoo artist.
""When am I going to get you in my chair?"" he always asked me with a grin, trailing his fingers over my skin. Bas teased me, but he was serious about wanting to tattoo me. ""All that virgin skin, just begging for my designs.""
""When I get over my fear of all those little needle pricks,"" I always answered back.
""Sure you can't join me this weekend?"" he asked, coming to stand in front of me undressed before sweetening the pot. ""Some of your favorite authors are going to be there.""
""Wish I could, but I have work on Saturday morning."" That was a lie. I'd made a last minute swap with one of my colleagues so I could attend the auction. I wanted to see exactly what happened at one.
At that, I twisted away from his hands, and he frowned.
""I don't like you moving away from me, Teshi.""
I shrugged. ""I don't like you saying what you did in that Facebook interview.""
""Can we talk about it tonight? Or when I get back on Sunday so tonight can just be nice?""
With the other surprise I'd been planning for him tonight, we would have had a nice night. Or a temporary truce, at least. He would have been over the moon when I walked into his room at the studio because I'd finally decided to let him ink me, and even though I was unhappy with him, I wasn't going to back out...I might never get the courage again.
I'd booked the appointment weeks ago under a fake name, figuring I could use the time to really psych myself up for needles and pain. Paige, the receptionist, was the only one who knew it was me, and I was surprised she hadn't ruined the surprise for Bas. She'd been a friend of his former fianc√©e, and although she normally was casually dismissive of me, she sometimes made sly little digs.
""He prefers his women tattooed,"" Paige would say while I waited for Bas. ""Regina let him ink her as often as possible.""
Ah, yes, the ideal, dimpled, petite Regina.
""Yet that didn't keep them together, did it?"" I asked coolly. ""I'm married to him and she's...a footnote in his life who used to wear his ring.""
I never told Bas about her catty comments because I believed in either handling bitches myself or ignoring them when they were trying so hard to get a reaction. And Bas would have had a reaction because nobody was allowed to say anything against me.
Except his alter ego, Chase Miles, in a roundabout way.
Paige called me an hour before I was supposed to walk into the studio.
""Sorry, Teshi, I have to cancel your appointment.""
""Is Bas OK?""
""Yeah. He had a urgent request from a really important client, and he told me to cancel everything tonight.""
""OK.""
""Would you like to reschedule now?"" she asked sweetly.
""I'll call back next week.""
""So sorry it didn't work out for tonight, but this is kind of a rush and it's a very detailed, intricate tattoo, so it's going to take a long time.""
""Got it,"" I said.
It wouldn't make sense to me until later why she was being so polite and chatty. But if the first dot had dropped during the Chase Miles interview, the second dot would be dropping soon. And the third dot would be dropping not long after, and I'd finally be able to connect them.
My phone rang not long after I hung up with Paige. Bas.
""I'm sorry, Tesh, but I'm going to be really late tonight. Had a last-minute client who's on a time crunch and she needs this tattoo done tonight so it has time to heal before a photoshoot she has coming up in a few weeks.""
Bas had a lot of high-end clients who were models, actors, rockstars, country music stars, so this last-minute request wasn't out of the ordinary.
""OK.""
I knew if he'd realized I was one of the appointments he'd had Paige call to reschedule, he wouldn't have canceled me.
How adorable was I for thinking that?
""Teshi, you know I'd rather be home with you. Can we have breakfast before you head to work tomorrow?""
""If you want to get up early and make it, sure. I have to be at work by seven thirty, though.""
""I'll make you whatever you want."" He paused, and his voice was heavy. ""I'm sorry, Tesh.""
""Not a problem.""
I'd find out later what a lie that was. It was a big problem.
And about to get bigger.
""Where are you?"" I texted my husband. I'd awakened to an empty bed and an empty house. Bas's side of the bed had never been slept in, and I checked the two other bedrooms in the house and those also were empty.
I heard the front door open.
""I'm right here,"" he said, obviously having read the text I'd sent only seconds ago.
He came over to me to give me a hug, but I stepped back, hands on my hips.
""Where were you all night?""
""The tattoo took forever, so after she left the studio, I cleaned up and crashed on the couch.""
""Alone?""
Now Bas took a step back. ""What the heck, Teshi? Yes, alone.""
""Why not come home?""
""Because I was wiped out, bleary eyed and didn't want to wake you up.""
""And no text to tell me what was going on?""
""I should have, Tesh. I'm sorry for worrying you. I made a bad judgment call, but again, it was really late, I knew you were probably asleep since you hadn't texted and I didn't want to wake you up.""
""The last two days haven't been good, Bas. And you cancelled on us last night for a tattoo but told me we could have breakfast together before I left for work.""
""I'm sorry I missed making you breakfast,"" he said. ""I'm sorry about everything, Tesh. peck me before you go, and I'll see you Sunday night, but I'll call you every day. Any particular books from your favorite authors you want signed?""
""Sorry, Bas. I don't feel like pecking you, and I don't want you to get me any books.""
I'd get them myself.
""I'll text you my schedule so you'll know when I have down time and you can expect a call.""
I shrugged, more upset with my husband than I'd ever been. Something felt off. Those dots I hadn't connected yet.
""I'm heading off to work.""
Bas snagged me around the waist. ""Tesh, I don't care how mad you are, we don't leave the house, especially if one of us is traveling, without a peck.""
That was true, so I gave in a bit and pecked him briefly. Nothing like our usual deep, ravenous pecks. Bas noticed because he sighed.
""I love you, Tesh.""
""I love you, too.""
He reluctantly let me go then, and I drove to work, my head definitely not in the mood. Honestly, giving a massage this morning would be easier than stretching my client because I didn't have to talk while I gave a massage.
I managed to pull on my professionalism by the time I arrived at work, and my client was none the wiser about my bad, suspicious mood. My other clients followed her, and by the time lunch rolled around, I was starving. I'd had my phone on vibrate, so I was expecting a few texts from Bas and I wasn't disappointed.
I hate that I let you down last night and this morning. I'm sorry, baby.
Getting ready to leave, but I wish I could stay and talk with you. I want you to feel better and I hate that I made you suspicious of me.
I love you, Teshi. You are my ideal woman in every way.
Babe, I'm in the car about to drive away. I'll call you when I get there, and I'll miss you until I can get back to you and make everything right.
Wanting to believe him but not quite able to, I sighed at his texts and walked to the deli next door to get a sandwich. Why is it you're swimming along nicely, then you suddenly hit a riptide and feel like you're being pulled out to sea? I pondered that as I ate my sandwich and my phone chimed.
Pulling it out of my pocket, I saw that I'd been tagged in a picture of some woman's as$. She had a bikini top on and nothing down below, not even a thong. She had an intricate, detailed and delicate tattoo that rounded her hips and trailed over her entire as$.
The tattoo took forever...
Had a last-minute client who's on a time crunch and she needs this tattoo done tonight so it has time to heal before a photoshoot she has coming up in a few weeks.
OK, I wasn't going to freak out. Both Bas and I had jobs that required us to have our hands all over other people's bodies. We had talked about that early on in our relationship and how to prevent jealousy, so I wasn't ready to throw a fit.
Until.
Until I read the caption.
Nothing like having your ex's hands all over you again. Thanks, Bas, for fitting me in last night. No one can deliver the ink like you do -- just look at that exquisite, detailed artistry and the fine lines. Can't wait for you to add color to it in a few weeks.",1,1755484603.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

A clown?Hara forced a weary smile. She was too tired.She slammed the divorce papers in front of them. ""To hell with your true love‚Äîhe‚Äôs no longer my husband.""

Chapter 1

""Hara, Ells is trending everywhere now. Reporters have completely blocked the hotel entrance. Could you handle this?""

It was 10:00 p.m.

Sitting at her desk, Harriet Chavez pinched the bridge of her nose, listening in silence as Patsy Medina, her mother-in-law, talked on the phone.

She was married to Ellsworth Townsend for three years, dealing with his scandals and mistresses almost every single day.

The few times she saw him, it was always about handling his affairs.

As Harriet remained silent, Patsy said earnestly, ""Hara, it's not just about the company's reputation or the stock price anymore. Kelsey's back. You know she isn't just any woman. You gotta protect your marriage with Ells.""

Kelsey Graham was back?

Harriet frowned slightly, a wave of weariness washing over her.

After a few more seconds, she finally replied, her voice gentle, ""I see, Patsy. I'm on it.""

After hanging up, she stared at her phone wearily for quite a while before grabbing her car keys and leaving.

\*\*\*

Half an hour later, Harriet entered through the hotel's back entrance and went upstairs.

Zane Herman, the Townsend family's servant, and Jolene Martinez, her secretary, were waiting for her by the door.

With a luxury shopping bag in hand, Jolene walked toward her. ""Ms. Chavez, the clothes are ready.""

It was identical to Kelsey's outfit tonight, prepared to help Ellsworth out of this.

Zane knocked on the door. ""Mr. Townsend, Mrs. Townsend is here.""

""Come in.""

Ellsworth's flat voice rang out. He didn't sound guilty or flustered at all.

Zane opened the door for Harriet just as Ellsworth walked out of the bathroom, his loose gray sleepwear doing little to conceal the toned muscles of his chest and abdomen. He towel-dried his hair casually, radiating effortless allure.

He was still calm when he saw Harriet, not guilty or embarrassed at all for being caught having an affair.

After three years, they were both used to this.

Ellsworth bent down and picked up a cigarette case and a lighter from the coffee table. He shook a cigarette out, held it between his lips, and leaned in to light it.

He exhaled a smoke ring and greeted Harriet as if nothing had happened. ""Hey.""

Harriet nodded and said in a businesslike tone, ""I'll go get changed.""

With that, she took the clothes handed by Jolene and walked toward the bedroom.

Just then, Kelsey stepped out, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear.

Harriet stopped abruptly at the doorway.

Kelsey... really was back.

At the sight of Harriet, Kelsey was momentarily stunned. But soon, she regained her composure and smiled, ""Hey, Hara.""

Then she patted Harriet's head and said softly, ""Thanks for your help, Hara.""

Harriet instinctively tightened her grip on the clothes and managed to say, ""Don't mention it, Kelsey.""

Back then, she was unaware that Kelsey was Ellsworth's first love and that he had never stopped loving her.

If she had known, she wouldn't have nodded when Ellsworth's grandfather, Raymond Townsend, asked her if she loved Ellsworth. Then Ellsworth wouldn't have been forced to marry her.

She wouldn't have been a complete joke.

Ellsworth was decisive and meticulous in everything he did. Under his leadership, the Townsend Group had risen to new heights.

Even senior executives twice his age had to treat him with respect, not daring to mess with him at all.

Yet this paragon of discretion had been so reckless in his personal life.

Harriet could think of only one reason-he must've been furious about the marriage. This was his way of humiliating her and getting back at Raymond.

Kelsey withdrew her hand and walked past Harriet, who instinctively turned around to look.

At the sight of Kelsey, Ellsworth handed her a coat and said gently, ""Put it on. I hate to see you catch a cold.""

""You're so sweet."" Kelsey smiled at him, looking genuinely happy.

Chapter 2

Harriet was flooded with a complicated mix of emotions as she looked at them.

Ellsworth used to be nice to her, saying yes to her every request. He had even carried her out from a fire once.

How had they ended up like this?

After staring at them for a while, Harriet stepped into the bedroom without saying a word.

As she walked out again in the white dress identical to Kelsey's, Kelsey had already left.

So had Jolene and Zane.

Meanwhile, someone kept banging on the door.

""Mr. Townsend, is it true that you're getting a divorce?""

""Mr. Townsend, are you with Ms. Graham now?""

If anyone had taken photos of Ellsworth and Kelsey together, the Townsend Group's stock would be in freefall tomorrow.

Ellsworth uncrossed his legs, tossed his phone away, and stood up. Then he strolled to the door and opened it.

""Mr. Townsend, will Ms. Chavez still work at the Townsend Group after the divorce? How much will she get?""

""Mr. Townsend, the whole town is waiting for your divorce negotiations. Will she get the Townsend Group's shares?""

Still standing by the bedroom door, Harriet chuckled. The reporters sounded so certain about a divorce-they sure had a knack for predicting things.

Looking at them, she steeled herself and walked gracefully behind Ellsworth.

She wrapped her slender arms around his waist, rested her chin on his shoulder, and asked in an affectedly sweet voice, ""Darling, what's going on?""

Ellsworth spun around the moment she hugged him and murmured ""Darling.""

""Ms. Chavez?""

""Ms. Chavez?""

""It's Ms. Chavez, not Ms. Graham.""

The reporters went into a frenzy, snapping photos the second Harriet showed up, thinking they had finally caught Ellsworth in some major gossip.

However, they were disappointed again. Like always, it was Harriet.

Harriet kept her arms around Ellsworth's waist as he turned to the reporters and asked lazily, ""Need me to clarify anything?""

""Mr. Townsend, Ms. Chavez, sorry for interrupting you.""

""Mr. Townsend, please forgive us.""

They hastily apologized and then left.

Ellsworth closed the door and turned around. Harriet quickly withdrew her arms and explained, ""It was just to convince the reporters.""

She was polite yet distant.

Ellsworth didn't say anything. He walked to the coat rack and took off his robe, his back to her.

He had broad shoulders and a lean waist.

Thanks to years of working out, every cut and curve of his body was perfectly defined.

Harriet's cheeks heated. She lowered her head and then said quietly, ""I'm going back to the office.""

Then she opened the door and left.

Ellsworth turned and stared at the door for a long time.

Then he continued to get dressed.

\*\*\*

On the way back, Harriet clutched the steering wheel with both hands, feeling exhausted.

Her chest tightened.

Last month, during her check-up, a small nodule was found. The doctor recommended she avoid stress and scheduled regular monitoring appointments.

The nodule had appeared only after her marriage.

She turned to glance at the divorce agreement on the passenger seat and sighed helplessly.

In fact, she had taken it with her into the room.

But she took it back.

Over the past three years, she had considered a divorce countless times. However, the scene where Ellsworth carried her out of the fire always emerged in her mind, stopping her from bringing it up.

What if Ellsworth agreed to the divorce? Then there'd be no going back.

So, she had held onto those papers.

\*\*\*

After Harriet solved the scandal crisis, everything returned to normal.

It was like nothing had happened at all.

One morning, when Harriet passed by the small conference room, she heard voices inside.

""You want me to do it again? Ellsworth, spare me. I've already done it six times.""

""I'm so jealous of Harriet. Marrying you completely changed her life, Ellsworth. She doesn't even have to handle proposals anymore. All she does is sign contracts.""

Chapter 3

""You're jealous of her? About what? How calculating she is? The way she wraps people around her finger? Or her world-class tolerance? Did you see the trending topics that night? She went for another cover-up for Ellsworth. None of us could ever do that."" Another woman clicked her tongue.

Then a male's voice rang out. ""Ellsworth, they say you and Ms. Graham were doing it when Harriet walked into the room. That's truly heartbreaking! Did she cry?""

Amused, Ellsworth asked, ""Where did you hear that? That's quite a story.""

The truth was, when he and Kelsey were having dinner that night, the waiter accidentally spilled juice on them, so they went upstairs to change their clothes. That was all.

But he didn't explain anything. He didn't give a damn about what others thought, let alone Harriet's feelings.

""Ellsworth, you're way out of Harriet's league. Why don't you divorce her and give someone else a shot?""

Harriet stood frozen outside the door.

Inside, Ellsworth was talking about his affair as if he were discussing the weather, looking nonchalant and even happy.

Her gaze fixed on him.

Ellsworth's current project was assigned by the government and was being handled by some of his close friends.

He had never allowed Harriet to get involved in projects like this.

After getting married, he kept her at a complete distance. She was excluded from his social life and his personal life, and their relationship grew more strained than it had ever been.

Lounging on the chair, Johnathan Burton, one of Ellsworth's friends, said, ""Ells, ignore their nonsense. Hara's been managing things at work and taking care of everything at home.

""She not only tolerated your affairs. She even dealt with them. What other woman would do that?

""You're like the luckiest man in the world. If I were you, I'd keep her close and never let her go.""

Brittany Vaughn, Ellsworth's loyal admirer, immediately retorted, ""I can do those things too, and I'd be even better.

""Ellsworth, divorce her and marry me. My family's significantly wealthier, and I'd be a stronger ally in every way.""

""Get real, Brittany. Have you forgotten about Kelsey?""

Ellsworth joked with a smile, ""Brittany, let me know when your family has the wedding gifts for us ready.""

Laughter broke out in the conference room. Harriet turned around and went back to her office in silence.

She did come from an ordinary family.

Her mother, a teacher, died from an illness when she was eight years old. Her father, a police officer, died in the line of duty a few years ago.

Though her grandfather, Ralph Chavez, had been in the military, he wasn't exactly high-ranking-he drove for Raymond.

That was why she and Ellsworth had known each other since childhood.

After the marriage, Raymond had arranged for her to be the company's VP, supporting Ellsworth.

She knew what he really wanted was for her to keep Ellsworth in check.

But she had failed.

Harriet took the divorce papers from the drawer, gazing at them for a long time.

She should have stopped lying to herself a long time ago. Deep down, she had always known she could never win Ellsworth's heart.

All of a sudden, she wanted to give up.

She didn't want to separate him from the love of his life.

So, when the meeting was over, Harriet went to Ellsworth.

As she reached his office door, he happened to open it from inside.

He seemed a bit surprised at the sight of her. ""What's up?""

She said, ""A couple of documents need your signature.""

He sat back at his desk and picked up a pen.

After he signed the documents, Harriet slid two copies of the divorce agreement across the desk and said flatly, ""When you're free, let's get a divorce.""

His right hand, still holding the pen, hovered mid-air as he looked up at her.

Chapter 4

After a while, Ellsworth said with a half-smile, ""This is so typical of you, always following your own rules. This marriage only happened because you insisted on it. And now, you want a divorce?""

Harriet didn't withdraw her hand holding the divorce agreement. ""I gave it some serious thought. I don't think we're cut out for each other. Besides, I didn't know about you and Kelsey back then. And I didn't know...""

He interrupted her before she could finish, ""Harriet, it's true that Kelsey's back. But that doesn't mean you get to play games. Also, playing hard to get doesn't work with me.""

To him, Harriet had always coveted his family's fame and power. With her calculated charm, she had sweet-talked Raymond into welcoming her as part of the family.

She actually claimed she wanted a divorce? Did she really expect him to buy that?

Harriet didn't know what to say, facing Ellsworth's prejudice against her.

He thought she was playing hard to get?

There was nothing she could do to change the way he thought of her.

Back then, he had loved Kelsey and hated her. But how could she possibly know that?

She clutched the papers so tightly that the veins on the back of her hand were bulging.

But she had to maintain her composure and elegance. She said, her voice still steady, ""Ellsworth, I don't care what you think this is. You'll know whether I'm serious about the divorce once we go to the courthouse.""

Sensing the resolution in her voice, Ellsworth glanced at her before saying indifferently, ""Alright. You want a divorce? Sure.""

Then he added, ""But is Sir Chavez OK with this? Have you gotten the birth certificate? Have you told my grandpa? Has he agreed to this?

""If you really want a divorce, get them to agree first before coming to me. Don't waste my time.""

His casual questioning left Harriet speechless.

He was right. It was impossible for her to get a divorce just because she wanted it.

Marriage was never just about two people. She had to take their families into consideration.

Pale-faced, she looked at Ellsworth, not saying a word. He stood up and said, still deadpan, ""Otherwise, stick to your roles as the company's VP and my wife.""

Her right hand, gripping the papers, hovered mid-air. She parted her lips, wanting to explain, but no words came out.

After quite a while, she said, ""I didn't think it through. I'll talk to them as soon as possible.""

This time, he didn't bother to respond. He just left the office with both hands in his pockets.

She wanted a divorce?

Yeah, right.

Till today, he still vividly remembered how thrilled she had been the day they got married.

As he closed the door, Harriet pinched the bridge of her nose and exhaled deeply.

\*\*\*

Back at her office, Harriet told Kathie Townsend about her conversation with Ellsworth.

Kathie was Ellsworth's younger sister, and she also worked at the company.

She was the same age as Harriet, and they had been thick as thieves since childhood.

Kathie had been away on a business trip for the past few days.

She and Ellsworth had an older brother, Kenneth Townsend, who worked in the military.

""Finally, Hara. I'm so glad you thought it through."" On the phone, Kathie sounded both relieved and surprised.

""Chill. I've got your back. Just ask Sir Chavez for your birth certificate. With his and my grandpa's approval, I'm sure you can get a divorce. I'll talk to my grandpa.""

""Thank you, Kat.""

""Don't say that.""

To Kathie, with everything Ellsworth had done, he didn't deserve to be Harriet's husband at all. Otherwise, she wouldn't have helped Harriet get a divorce.

With Kathie's support, Harriet instantly felt much more confident.

Come evening, she clocked out and went home.

The Chavez's mansion was located in an old alley downtown.

Chapter 5

Having been renovated a few times over the years, the two-story mansion maintained its classical essence while embracing modern sophistication.

Red roses cascaded over the courtyard wall, whispering in the breeze in contrast to the quiet alley.

Harriet pulled over and then entered the mansion with Ralph's favorite pastries.

""Ms. Chavez, you're back,"" said Deloris Henson, the maid.

""Hey, Deloris.""

Harriet nodded at her before going to Ralph.

Most twenty-three-year-olds came with effortless youth and sunlit vitality, dressing like a walking rainbow.

Yet Harriet had always dressed in muted tones. She seldom smiled, her hair always a low chignon.

After all, she was the company's VP, Ellsworth's wife.

She spent the entire evening keeping Ralph company.

After dinner, they played chess. Only then did he say, ""You've been frowning since you came back. Tell me. What's bothering you?""

Holding a piece, Harriet looked up at him.

After a few minutes, she said, ""Grandpa, I don't wanna be with Ellsworth anymore. I want a divorce.""

She didn't say this impulsively. It was a decision based on serious deliberation.

Ralph's expression darkened as he fell silent.

After a long time, he stood up, went to his bedroom, and returned soon.

""Back then, I asked you if you were sure. You said yes,"" he said, still looking grim.

Then he sighed helplessly, not bothering to scold her, ""Never mind. You've done everything you could in this marriage. You came back for your birth certificate, right? Fine. If a divorce is what you want, so be it. Perhaps it'll be a relief for both you and Ells.""

Saying this, he handed her the birth certificate.

He wasn't one for online news, but he had heard about Ellsworth enough.

Since Ellsworth didn't have any feelings for Harriet, a divorce might be the best choice.

Love couldn't be compelled.

Harriet's eyes reddened as her gaze fell upon the birth certificate in Ralph's hand. ""Grandpa, I'm sorry.""

She had made herself a joke in the marriage. Worst, Ralph had been humiliated, too.

Putting the birth certificate into her hand, Ralph sat down. ""You don't have to say sorry to anyone. I just want you to be happy-promise me you'll stay away from those who upset you.""

Tightening her grip on the birth certificate, Harriet nodded.

The nameless sadness still lingered, though she didn't know what she was sad about.

It was past 9:00 p.m.

Leaving the mansion, she sent Kathie a message and a photo on WhatsApp.

""Kat, I've got the birth certificate.""

Soon, Kathie sent her a sixty-second voice message, telling her what to do next.

\*\*\*

Ellsworth was drinking with his friends in a bar, including Johnathan and Darrick Lozano.

The flickering neon lights cast hues across their faces and the glasses on the table.

Ellsworth's life was far livelier than Harriet's.

Several women tried to cozy up to him, but he showed no response.

Lounging on the couch lazily, Johnathan said with a roguish smile while looking at him, ""I heard Hara proposed a divorce. Is that true?""

Ellsworth picked up a cigarette and a lighter from the table and lit it.

Blowing out a thin wisp of smoke expertly, he flicked off some ash and smiled, ""You're well-informed, just as always. What does Kat want to know this time?""

Johnathan shook his head. ""Enough is enough, Ells. Being your wife hasn't been easy for Hara. You can have fun however you want, but at least go back once in a while and sweet-talk her.""

""Sweet-talk her?""

Ellsworth let out a cold sneer while smoking.

Sweet-talk Harriet?

Not going to happen.

Just then, the screen of his phone on the table lit up.

Kathie texted him on WhatsApp, ""Ells, just so you know, Hara has gotten her birth certificate.""

She then forwarded the photo of Harriet's birth certificate to him.

He was slightly surprised.

Harriet had indeed come to Ralph for her birth certificate? She was... serious about getting a divorce?

Chapter 6

He zoomed in on the photo, scrutinizing the image extremely carefully till the burning cigarette stung his fingers. Only then did he snap out of it and toss his phone away.

A second later, it rang, the screen lighting up with ""Mom"" flashing on it.

He unlocked to answer and then heard her voice. ""Ells, where are you tonight? Could you stop being such a handful at least once in a while and go stay home for a couple of nights?

""You've always left Hara alone back home. How could you do this to her?""

He frowned. ""Did she put a spell on you on what? All of you side with her. Enough. I see.""

Everyone else in the family liked Harriet, including Raymond, Kathie, and his parents.

What was so good about her?

He hung up and stood up. Picking up his suit jacket, he said to Johnathan and Darrick expressionlessly, ""I gotta go. Something came up.""

Johnathan straightened up a little, arching an eyebrow. ""The show hasn't even started yet. Are you sure?""

No longer in the mood, he waved his hand while heading to the bar entrance.

He started his car, leaving the car window open.

Steering the wheel with his right hand, he rested his left arm on the window frame with a cigarette between his fingers. The rhythm of ""Five Hundred Miles"" through the Burmester sound system echoed in the car.

He still didn't get it. There was nothing special about Harriet. How could she wrap everyone else in the family around her little finger?

And... What was he thinking, agreeing to marry her in the first place?

He took a drag from his cigarette and then exhaled a slow swirl of smoke.

Seeing only a few cars in sight, he flicked away the half-smoked cigarette and slammed the accelerator. With a roar, the car surged forward and soon disappeared into the distance.

\*\*\*

In the bedroom of the villa.

Harriet took some shower gel and skincare products from the bathroom and reached for the bedroom door. Just then, someone opened it.

She looked up.

Then she was dumbfounded.

Ellsworth?

What was he doing back?

Ellsworth had only come home a handful of times over the past three years. At the sight of him, Harriet was utterly stunned.

She blurted out, ""Why are you back?""

Immediately, she explained, ""I'm not saying you can't come back. I mean, it's your home, and you can come back anytime you want.""

She added after a brief pause, ""I haven't used the bathroom or slept in the bed for a while now. Jacquelyn and the others clean and disinfect every day.""

Jacquelyn Becker was one of the servants here.

As Harriet said this, some memories flashed across her mind. She had once grabbed Ellsworth's sleeve, and he had tossed the black suit jacket away later.

From then on, she had never touched him or his things again unless necessary.

If he wanted to stay the night, she didn't want him to be disgusted by her presence in the master bedroom.

The truth was, she had moved into the guest room next door shortly after their marriage.

Ellsworth took off his jacket and casually tossed it onto the couch.

She stepped aside to make way.

Since he didn't say anything, she lowered her head, ready to step out with the things she had taken from the bathroom. Just then, he asked, his voice icy, ""You've got the birth certificate?""

Looking at him, she nodded. ""Yes. Grandpa gave it to me. I don't think Sir Townsend will raise any objections either.""

She used to call Raymond by his first name, but Ellsworth always addressed Ralph as ""Sir Chavez"", as if drawing a clear boundary between the two families. Eventually, she, too, began calling Raymond ""Sir Townsend"".

She had also heard Ellsworth loved Kelsey very much.

Chapter 7

It was most likely true-after all, all his rumored girlfriends resembled Kelsey in a certain way.

So, what was the point of clinging to him, trying to win his favor?

Ellsworth glanced at her and then tugged at his collar, revealing his collarbones and slender neck, which effortlessly exuded a roguish charm.

She said, ""I'm going back to the guest room, then.""

As she pulled open the door, she found Jacquelyn eavesdropping outside.

The atmosphere froze for a second.

""Mrs. Harriet Townsend,"" Jacquelyn smiled awkwardly. Then she whispered, ""Mrs. Patsy Townsend just called. She wanted to remind you to seize the opportunity.

""It's getting late. Mr. Townsend, Mrs. Harriet Townsend, I'll get out of your hair now.""

After saying that, she closed the door and left.

Standing at the doorway, Harriet felt torn.

Pondering for a while, she turned to look at Ellsworth. ""I'll go to the guest room later.""

Still saying nothing, he rummaged through the closet, his upper body bare.

It was so typical of him-he had always ignored her, never responding to her calls or texts.

She had endured emotional neglect since day one of their three-year marriage.

At first, she'd feel embarrassed and sad, but now? She felt nothing.

Assuming he was looking for his sleepwear, she placed the things in her arms onto the couch, walked toward him, and opened the adjacent closet door. ""All your sleepwear is here.""

She didn't reach for them, steering clear of his things as always.

He took a dark gray set and entered the bathroom, not sparing a glance at her.

After he stepped inside, she couldn't help but exhale.

It was so suffocating.

He made her feel like she owed him a lot.

After a while, Ellsworth finished his shower. He stepped out in his sleepwear, towel-drying his hair casually.

Harriet was sitting cross-legged on the sofa, working on her laptop.

As his icy gaze fell upon her, he had to admit-he was surprised to see her get her birth certificate back.

But her title as the company's VP meant so much to her.

Could she really bear to give it up?

Harriet didn't notice him. In fact, she had completely forgotten that he was here.

She was slightly startled when she heard his footsteps.

Standing up with the laptop in her arms, she said, ""Jacquelyn and the others should be asleep by now. Get some rest.""

Suddenly, she tumbled back onto the couch.

She bent forward to rub her calves.

Her loose pajama top gaped, exposing her cleavage.

Her skin was flawless, radiating an innocent yet intoxicating allure.

Ellsworth's gaze deepened.

A divorce?

That was just her excuse to let his guard down. What she really wanted was to climb into his bed.

She said while looking up, seeming quite embarrassed, ""My feet fell asleep.""

Ellsworth looked at her coldly. All of a sudden, he hurled the towel at her and snapped, ""Harriet, what tricks are you pulling this time?""

The towel landed accurately on her right cheek, which hurt.

She lowered her head and fell silent for several seconds. Then she put the towel on the couch, struggled to stand up, and said flatly, ""Rest assured, Ellsworth. I'm not pulling any tricks. I'm serious about the divorce.""

She had been crazy about him in the early days of their marriage.

That year, she was only twenty. She had done everything she could-hitting on him, learning to cook and brew coffee for him, and prioritizing his needs every time.

He had been her entire world.

But not anymore.

She limped toward the door, her gaze inadvertently falling upon Ellsworth's face when she walked past him.

The disgusted look on his face drained the light from her eyes.

After returning to the guest room, she leaned against the door for a long time.

Eventually, she smiled self-mockingly.

The melancholy made her stomach ache again. Frowning, she rubbed her lower abdomen and sat on the bed after feeling better.

Chapter 8

She had been suffering from stomach pain and nausea for quite some time now.

The next day, she went to the hospital for a general check-up. The doctor said there was nothing serious, so she drove back to the company shortly after.

""Hara.""

The elevator arrived at the office floor. As she stepped out, she heard a familiar voice.

Looking up, she saw Kelsey walking toward her in a red dress with a warm smile.

She greeted Kelsey, ""Hello, Kelsey.""

Still smiling, Kelsey gave her a once-over and said, ""It's been a couple of years, and you've become even prettier, Hara.""

She put on a smile as well. ""You, too, Kelsey.""

Kelsey and Ellsworth were of the same age, both three years older than her.

She wasn't exactly their childhood friend. Given the gap in their family backgrounds, she was at best a fringe presence in their inner circle.

In the past, Ellsworth would occasionally invite her to hang out with them. But now, only Kathie remained her friend.

Kelsey smiled, ""Hara, you haven't had lunch, right? Wanna join me?""

She shook her head. ""Another time, maybe. I have to...""

But Kelsey interrupted her before she could finish, ""Come on, Hara. Don't tell me you'll have lunch later. I ran into Jolene a few minutes ago, and she told me you went to the hospital for a stomach check-up. How are you supposed to work with an empty stomach? Let's go.""

When saying this, she grabbed Harriet's hand, leaving no room for refusal.

The radiant smile on her face made it difficult for Harriet to say no.

They soon arrived at a restaurant, and Kelsey poured some water for Harriet. ""I know all about Ells' bad temper. Those years must have been tough for you.""

Harriet smiled, ""It's OK. We rarely see each other after all.""

Knowing Kelsey was fishing for information, she said this truthfully.

Kelsey and Ellsworth were bound to be together. Why would she stand in their way?

After pouring the water, Kelsey put down the carafe. ""This isn't a long-term solution. What are your plans, Hara?""

Picking up the glass, Harriet took a sip of the water and said, ""Ellsworth and I are splitting up. My grandpa has already given me my birth certificate, and I don't think Sir Townsend will have an issue with it either.""

Ellsworth didn't want to stay with her, and now, the feeling was mutual.

Kelsey sighed, ""I feel so awful. If I hadn't kept things hidden back then, none of this would have happened. But I guess there's a silver lining after all-you don't have children, which makes things much easier.""

Harriet smiled, ""You're right.""

Just then, Kelsey waved at someone behind her. ""Over here, Ells.""

Harriet turned around, only to see Ellsworth walking over in his navy-blue suit, brimming with vigor and vitality.

Somehow, she felt he was glowing.

His presence always outshone everything and everyone around him.

Ellsworth's expression darkened a little when he saw Harriet.

She pulled out an awkward smile.",1,1755484517.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I've been messing around with wired CarPlay on my 2016 Civic lately, and it's really driving me crazy. Every time I drive, it's like surgery: plugging and unplugging, cleaning coffee stains...
A friend recommended the CarProKit wireless adapter, saying it works amazingly, but the official website seems to have several versions, and I'm completely confused ü§Ø.
So, I'd like to ask you veterans:
I was originally planning to try their 4.0 version (which supports wireless CarPlay and Android Auto, so I don't have to mess with USB!), but when I checked compatibility, I saw:
""Only compatible with 2017 and later models"" (I have a 2016 LX, and the head unit is super old, it might even only have one TF card slot...).
Now I'm torn:
Should I take the risk and try 4.0? Supporters say it's reliable, but others suggest it might be risky for the car's electrical system...
Or should I go with the legendary 2.0 version ""for older cars""? But I'm really eager to try out all the cool features in 4.0, like split-screen...
Fellow 2016 owners, have you tried:
Installing 4.0 directly? Does it work reliably?
How smooth are 2.0/3.0 versions? Will it be so laggy that I almost drop my phone?
I'm also considering upgrading my head unit, but my student budget is really limited...
I'd really appreciate some real-world experiences! Car technology has advanced so rapidly in recent years, but can our older cars keep up? I'd love to hear your stories and suggestions!",1,1755484492.0,CarPlay,0,1.0,False

As Regional Manager, it is my duty‚Ä¶ no, my honor‚Ä¶ to fix this.

I told myself it was just a coincidence-until my family announced their engagement.

She was my sister. I loved her. So I ran from the city and the memories.

Years later, I came back, believing I was free at last.

Stacy and Cordell had a child.

And me? I was tangled in a scandal with notorious playboy Jackson.

Happiness always seemed just out of reach.

Until Jackson slipped a ring on my finger.‚ÄúElaine, I‚Äôll love you forever.‚Äù

My family cheered-but Cordell?

He pulled me close, his voice dark and possessive: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs mine.‚Äù

Chapter1

Elaine Valentine and her sister Stacy Valentine had fallen in love with the same man.

Cordell Decker.

Now, he was her brother-in-law.

When she first heard that her sister, Stacy, was going to marry Cordell, she made a firm decision to leave the country.

Her eyes reflected a sense of defeat and despair. ""I'm never coming back, and I won't bless you both.""

After leaving for abroad, she cut off all contact with everyone, even avoiding logging into WhatsApp for a long time.

That was, until one day when she suddenly called Marcelo Valentine, asking for a large sum of money. That was the first time she'd reached out to her family.

As she stepped out of the airport, Rubin Krueger, who had come to pick her up, immediately spotted her. He hurried over and took the suitcase from her hands. ""Ms. Valentine.""

She glanced around. Aside from Rubin, there was no one else to greet her. A bitter smile tugged at the corner of her lips.

At home, Stacy came forward to greet her. ""Elaine, you've finally come back.""

Three years had passed, and Stacy, now married, was even more beautiful than before.

She wore a light blue dress, with delicate butterfly embroidery at the collar. The high slit revealed her long, flawless legs.

Her hair, once long, had been cut short. The ends curled slightly, dyed a soft chestnut brown, accentuating her fair skin. She looked effortlessly chic and stunning.

She descended the stairs slowly, exuding the calm elegance of a wealthy young woman.

""Stacy,"" Elaine called softly, her voice lacking the usual softness and coquettish tone.

Stacy reached the bottom of the stairs and took in Elaine's appearance, noting how much thinner she had become. She looked almost skeletal.

Stacy's heart ached. ""Was life in Drego that tough?""

""It wasn't tough. Everything's fine,"" Elaine replied, always sticking to her default answer when asked about Drego-""Fine.""

Stacy knew Elaine's stubbornness. If Elaine didn't want to share, asking was pointless.

Noticing the fatigue in Elaine's eyes, she suggested, ""Why don't you rest upstairs for a while? After you wake up, I'll have the servants make your favorite dishes.""

""Okay,"" Elaine murmured, too tired to argue. She nodded and went upstairs, familiar with the house and making her way to the guest room with ease.

After a hot shower, she dried her hair and lay down on the bed, closing her eyes.

But her sleep wasn't peaceful. As usual, her dreams were strange and unsettling.

When she woke up, the evening had already settled in. She reached for her phone on the nightstand-it was already 9:30 PM.

She hadn't eaten much on the plane, and now she was starting to feel hungry.

She changed clothes and decided to head downstairs. As she stepped out of the guest room, she glanced down the hallway.

Stacy was on the sofa, watching a variety show, while the maid had placed a fruit platter on the coffee table.

Just as Elaine took a few steps down, she saw Cordell walking back inside. A servant quickly went to take his shoes and place them at his feet.

Her footsteps froze. She gripped the golden handrail tightly, her fingers curling into a fist.

Compared to three years ago, he was even more mature and charismatic, wearing a well-tailored dark suit and a white shirt, exuding a cold, clean aura.

He was bent over at the entrance, changing his shoes, and hadn't noticed her on the stairs.

She hesitated, wondering if she should continue down. She thought it would be awkward for all three of them, and just as she was about to turn back to her room, she heard Stacy's voice calling her name. ""Elaine.""

Her body stiffened. She instinctively bit her lip, her nails digging into her palm, the sharp pain spreading through her hand.

After a long pause, she turned around, her expression returning to its usual calm, with no hint of emotion.

Stacy was sitting on the sofa, looking at her, while Cordell, still at the entrance, had also turned his attention toward her.

She glanced at him briefly before subtly shifting her gaze, walking down the stairs. ""Stacy, I'm hungry.""

Stacy smiled warmly and called out, ""Janine.""

Janine Zavala emerged from the kitchen, and upon seeing Elaine walking down the stairs, she cheerfully greeted her, ""Ms. Valentine.""

Before Stacy married Cordell, Elaine used to visit the Decker family frequently, so the household staff all knew her.

Elaine had never been haughty, despite being from a wealthy family. She used to call Janine sweetly, and the maid had a good impression of her.

Cordell entered the living room, and Stacy effortlessly took his coat, hanging it up in the cloakroom. The way they interacted felt like an old married couple.

Elaine couldn't help but feel a sharp pang in her chest, as if a blade was cutting through her heart, leaving a painful, aching tightness.

Janine brought out the food prepared for her, and Elaine walked to the dining room. She casually asked, ""Where's Annie?""

Annie Ortiz was an old servant of the Decker family who had always been very fond of Elaine. Whenever she visited, Annie would prepare her favorite dishes and fruits.

Stacy, noticing the faint smell of alcohol on Cordell, asked the servant to prepare some coffee. Hearing Elaine's question, she replied, ""Annie's grandson is sick, so she took the day off.""

Cordell, looking tired, leaned back on the sofa. He glanced over at the dining table, where Elaine sat. Her face had lost its youthful roundness. The white dress she wore made her skin look porcelain-smooth, and her features were sharp and delicate.

She had lost a lot of weight, the baby fat completely gone. Her sharp chin made her eyes appear even larger and more striking. They were still as dark and bright as before.

Elaine wasn't eating much. She took only a few bites before setting her fork down.

Noticing the uneaten food, Janine asked, ""Ms. Valentine, isn't the food to your liking?""

It shouldn't be the case, as everything was prepared just as she liked it.

Before Elaine could respond, Cordell spoke up, ""You shouldn't eat too much at night.""

As soon as he said that, Elaine looked up and met his gaze.

Chapter2

This was the first time in three years that Elaine looked directly at him, but after just a moment, she quickly averted her gaze.

Her eyes, as clear and dark as ever, no longer held the love they once did. Instead, they were calm and indifferent.

In that instant, his heart felt empty, and his gaze dimmed.

""Elaine, Mom and Dad went to Orevine to pick up Grandpa, so the house is empty. You should stay here for the next few days,"" Stacy said, adopting the tone of a considerate older sister. ""I can take care of you here at the Decker family home. You've been through so much on your own these past years.""

Even though Stacy knew about the past between Elaine and Cordell, she still invited her to stay at the Decker family house. If it weren't for Stacy's constant love and care, Elaine might have thought she was trying to make things awkward on purpose.

Though Stacy had an excellent reputation in high society-beautiful, graceful, and kind-inviting her husband's ex-girlfriend to stay in their home seemed a little too generous, even for her.

Despite being her sister, wouldn't any woman, in the name of protecting her marriage, be more cautious and guarded?

A faint, cold smile tugged at the corner of Elaine's lips. ""I've been alone in Drego all these years too.""

She had learned to survive in that strange, foreign place. Independence was something she had mastered. Besides, the Valentine family house was still home, and there were servants here.

Stacy looked at Elaine's thin face with concern. ""It's been three years since we've seen each other. Don't you want to catch up?""

""We'll have plenty of time for that,"" Elaine replied. Given the awkwardness between her and Cordell, there was really no reason to stay under the same roof. ""Stacy, please arrange for a driver to take me back to the Valentine family home.""

Cordell put down his coffee, grabbed his coat, and started to head upstairs. After taking a few steps, he paused. ""It's getting late. If you're leaving, maybe it's better to wait until tomorrow.""

Elaine glanced at the clock in the living room-it wasn't even 10:30 PM yet, hardly late. But seeing the look of expectation in Stacy's eyes, she hesitated for a moment before replying, ""Alright, I'll stay. Sorry for the trouble.""

As she spoke, Cordell, who had been halfway up the stairs, froze. Her polite, distant tone felt like a sharp knife, suddenly and painfully stabbing into his heart.

\*\*\*\*\*

Having just returned to the country, Elaine was still adjusting to the time difference. She spent the whole night tossing and turning, unable to sleep. When dawn finally broke, she managed to doze off for a short while.

She decided to head back to the Valentine family home that day. After waking up, she packed the clothes she'd worn the previous night, tidied up, and then headed downstairs.

In the living room, Cordell sat at the dining table in casual loungewear, reading the newspaper. A cup of milk and an untouched sandwich sat in front of him.

He looked up briefly, his expression serious as he read. When he heard her footsteps coming downstairs, he glanced over and called out, ""Janine."" The maid immediately set out her breakfast on the table.

Elaine walked over and sat down across from him, greeting him casually, ""Good morning.""

Cordell paused for a moment, then replied, ""Good morning.""

She found it strange. It was almost 8 AM-why was he still sitting here reading the newspaper? Wasn't he supposed to be going to work?

Her breakfast was the same as his: a sandwich, a cup of milk, and toast. She took a few bites of the sandwich, finished her milk, and then set down her napkin.

""Breakfast is important. You're eating too little,"" Cordell said, closing the newspaper. Her small appetite was honestly surprising.

Chapter3

""Mr. Decker."" Elaine dismissed his attempt to be considerate with a sharp, sarcastic smile, the corners of her mouth curling up. ""Focus on your own business and stop meddling in matters that have nothing to do with you.""

Her simple ""Mr. Decker"" landed like a heavy blow, a hammer crashing into his chest.

His face went pale. ""You're calling me Mr. Decker?""

She smirked, her tone turning cold and biting. ""What should I call you then?""

Cordell's face drained of color. He pressed his lips together, looking momentarily lost in thought. After a long silence, he finally muttered, ""Call me whatever you like.""

The atmosphere in the living room grew thick with tension. The servants, sensing the awkwardness between them, stayed far away.

""Cordell, Shauna seems to-"" Stacy's anxious voice broke the silence.

Stacy entered the room and noticed the strange tension between the two. She looked confused and asked, ""Elaine, you're up?""

Elaine turned to glance at the entrance. It was hard to ignore how well Stacy looked in her dress-her graceful features and tall, slender figure gave her the air of a woman from the early 20th century. She stood there effortlessly, exuding a refined, aristocratic charm.

But then, Elaine's gaze locked on something and her face went pale.

In Stacy's arms was a baby, dressed in pink, with tiny, chubby hands clutching her dress.

Stacy noticed where Elaine was looking and softly said, ""Elaine, this is Shauna Decker. She's just over a year old.""

If three years ago, when Cordell and Stacy married, her world had crumbled, then at this moment, it felt as though it had turned barren.

She clutched the edge of the table, doing everything she could to hide her shock and force herself to stay calm.

She should have seen it coming. They had been married for three years. Of course, they would have a child by now.

She remembered the days when they used to lie together, dreaming about the future. On the lawn behind the Decker family garden, she would lie in his arms, playing with his long, fair fingers.

""Cordell, what do you want to do after you graduate from college?""

He thought for a moment, then answered seriously, ""Work hard to make money, and then marry you.""

When he said that, her eyes, sparkling like stars, lit up with excitement. ""Then what?""

""Then you'll do your duty as my wife and give me a child. A daughter, ideally-one just like you, sweet and adorable. I'll spoil both of you.""

His tone was casual, but his gaze was intense and sincere.

Her heart soared with happiness, though she pretended to be coy, blushing as she playfully pinched his arm. ""You're impossible.""

Back then, she could think of nothing else but marrying Cordell after graduation.

""Then you'll need to think of a name for our daughter.""

""Let's call her Shauna.""

She wrinkled her nose in distaste. ""That's too ordinary. You're a top student at Hillcrest Academy, and you give your daughter such a lazy name? She'll probably disown you when she grows up.""

""But you and she will be my only ones."" He wasn't good with sweet talk, and after saying that, his ears turned red.

She hugged him tightly in excitement and kissed his cheek. ""Alright, but we agreed-the name Shauna will only be her nickname. You'll have to come up with a real name later, or else I'm worried she'll resent us when she grows up.""

Elaine smiled softly, her eyes clouded with a thin layer of mist. She forced herself to hold back the emotions, almost as if she were mocking herself, murmuring softly, ""I'm an aunt now. That's fine.""

Chapter4

Elaine walked over to Stacy, her gaze falling on the child in her arms.

Shauna's skin was as smooth and white as porcelain, like a little doll. Her chubby cheeks were a soft pink, and her big, round eyes were as dark and shiny as marbles, making her irresistibly cute.

A mist seemed to form in Elaine's eyes as she reached out and gently touched the baby's soft cheek. It felt as smooth as a freshly peeled egg, soft and tender under her fingertips.

This was his daughter, Shauna.

She paused for a moment, then gave a bitter smile.

He had a wife. He had a child. His daughter was named Shauna-the name that matched the daughter they had once imagined having together.

Stacy noticed Elaine's discomfort, but with everything happening, she couldn't focus on it. Her voice became urgent. ""Cordell, Shauna has diarrhea.""

Cordell immediately stood up, walking quickly toward them. He glanced at the baby in Stacy's arms before grabbing the car keys from the coffee table. ""We're going to the hospital.""

Elaine instinctively took a step forward to follow, but then stopped after just a couple of steps.

In his arms was his wife. His wife was holding their child. What was she supposed to do?

Watching them leave, Elaine bit her lip, clenching her hands by her sides. A faint, metallic taste lingered in her mouth.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Silver Oak Grand Hotel was the largest in Aleshire, grand and opulent. The corridors were lined with deep purple, embroidered carpets, and the crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling looked like a blooming white flowers, beautiful and sparkling.

With a soft chime, the elevator doors opened, and Elaine stepped out.

She wore a white dress with beige high heels. Her face was calm and pale, with a quiet elegance, and her tall, slender figure stood out as she walked.

She made her way straight to the presidential suite. Before arriving, she had learned that Jackson Mason had a long-term suite here at the Silver Oak Grand Hotel, one he used for his affairs.

To put it simply, ""affairs"" meant a lot more than casual meetings.

As she raised her hand to knock on the door, it suddenly swung open from the inside. A woman, crying and hiding her face, rushed past her, disheveled, clutching her purse tightly as she left in a hurry.

Jackson changed lovers every three months. He had just broken up with his last one a few days ago, so this woman... had her attempts to seduce him failed?

Elaine pushed the half-open door the rest of the way open and stepped inside. Her heart skipped a beat with nervousness as she scanned the room. It was empty, except for the sound of water running from the bathroom.

She tossed her handbag onto the couch and waited. After a moment, the bathroom door opened.

She turned her head at the sound, and her gaze fell on the man's strong, sculpted body. His handsome face was slightly flushed from the steam, and his wet, black hair clung to his forehead, with droplets of water glistening on his skin.

His chest, a smooth honey-tan, was flat and toned, and as the water from his hair dripped onto his chest, it followed a path down his body, slipping under the towel wrapped loosely around his waist.

This man-he was even more strikingly handsome than any celebrity.

When Jackson saw someone unexpectedly standing in the room, his brows furrowed in irritation. ""Get out.""

Elaine's cheeks flushed slightly. She cleared her throat to hide her embarrassment.

He was simply too good-looking.

It felt as if God had been extra kind to him when creating him.

Taking a deep breath, she steadied herself and then stated, ""Mr. Mason, I'm here to apply for the position of your next lover.""

Chapter5

Elaine was naturally shy, and saying something like that was difficult for her.

Once she spoke, her delicate face turned a soft pink, glowing under the light, her skin vibrant and radiant.

Her skin was flawless-smooth and pale like jewel. Her cheeks were soft and rosy, almost baby-like, so tender that they seemed to invite a gentle touch. Her beauty was pure but also had a subtle charm.

Jackson narrowed his eyes, looking her over slowly. His thin lips curled into a sarcastic smile. ""Not every woman who comes knocking gets what she wants.""

Elaine blushed with both embarrassment and frustration. The flush on her fair skin made her look even more captivating and radiant, while her clear eyes shone brightly.

She bit her lip and, gathering courage, moved closer to him, wrapping her arms around his waist-but not pressing her body against his.

She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze. ""So, what do you think of me?""

""Need money?"" His eyes twinkled with amusement as he glanced at her arms wrapped around him, as delicate as lotus stems.

""You're handsome. Being with you wouldn't be a loss,"" she said, flashing a smile. The chandelier overhead sparkled in her dark eyes.

Jackson scoffed. ""Is that all?""

She paused, thinking for a moment, then shook her head. ""That's it.""

He'd met plenty of women like her before, but none had been this blunt.

He couldn't help but look at her a little longer.

After a long silence, as he still hadn't spoken, Elaine raised her gaze to meet his deep, unreadable eyes. Slowly, her eyes traveled down his face until they landed on his thin, sculpted lips.

Standing on tiptoe, she leaned in. Just as her lips were about to brush against his, Jackson pulled away.

His voice was cold and detached. ""Go take a shower first.""

""Okay."" She responded quietly, heading to the bathroom, turning on the water, and standing under the shower, her heart pounding loudly.

For a brief moment, she regretted acting so impulsively. She stayed in the bathroom, hesitating for a while, before putting on a bathrobe. Taking a deep breath, she finally opened the bathroom door.

Jackson was leaning against the headboard, watching as she stepped out. The steam from the shower left a soft pink glow on her face, and the bathrobe was loosely tied, exposing her delicate collarbone, her skin flawless and smooth.

Elaine tugged at the bathrobe, which was clearly too big for her. It was Jackson's, and it hung loosely, almost to her ankles, looking slightly comical.

Seeing her awkwardly clutching the robe, Jackson frowned slightly. ""If you regret it, you can leave now.""

Elaine hesitated, then bit her lower lip, moving closer and slowly untying the bathrobe.

Though she was slender, her figure was well-proportioned, and her skin glowed like fine porcelain, smooth and radiant under the light.

She bent down to kiss him, but her inexperience showed in her tentative, unsure movements. Jackson turned his head slightly, avoiding her. ""No experience?""

Her face instantly flushed, and she wished she could bury her head in the pillow. She barely whispered, ""No.""

Jackson's gaze flickered to her flushed cheeks, and he noticed her long, dark lashes trembling slightly, revealing her nervousness and uncertainty.

He wasn't someone who believed in being morally perfect, so he didn't expect others to be either. But seeing her so shy and flustered made him pause for a moment.

Elaine lowered her eyes, waiting for him to react. After a long silence, feeling embarrassed, she almost wanted to pull back entirely.

She tried to move away from him, but in the next moment, he grabbed the back of her head, pulling her face down, flipping them over in one smooth motion.

Everything seemed to spin, and Elaine, panicked, clung to his neck, her eyes wide with a momentary sense of confusion.

As they switched positions, she found herself staring up at his handsome face, her breath catching in her throat.

Chapter6

The light from above cast a shadow across Jackson's handsome face as he fixed his gaze on her. ""What's your name?"" he asked.

Elaine's face turned slightly pale, and she answered slowly, each word measured. ""Elaine.""

""Have you thought this through? It's not too late to change your mind."" Jackson gave her one final chance.

Uncomfortable, Elaine shifted slightly. Jackson's expression darkened as he growled, ""Don't move!""

Startled, Elaine froze, her eyes locked on him. Her body became stiff and tense.

She was so nervous that her breath came in short, uneven bursts, causing her to speak a little more quickly than usual. ""I've thought about it carefully. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.""

She had been mulling it over for days before making the decision.

On her way here, she had almost reconsidered for a moment, but...

At that thought, a self-deprecating smile tugged at the corner of her mouth, and her eyes dimmed with a touch of sadness.

Jackson noticed the shift in her expression, sensing the faint sorrow on her face. His heart stirred slightly. ""How much do you need?""

Elaine blinked in confusion. ""What?""

Jackson furrowed his brow, his tone cool. ""How much money do you need?""

She stared at him, slightly stunned. His jawline was sharp and perfectly defined, and for a moment, she lost herself in the details of his face before quickly snapping out of it. With a soft smile, she responded, ""You can decide.""

Jackson raised an eyebrow, a hint of irritation in his expression.

She smiled again, her voice soft. ""Mr. Mason isn't the type to be stingy, so I'm not worried you'll give me too little.""

She had once thought that when she turned twenty, she would give the most precious thing she had to Cordell, the man she had loved for so long.

Jackson studied her for a moment, then leaned down to kiss her.

\*\*\*\*\*

Afterward, Jackson pulled away and got up to head into the bathroom.

Elaine grabbed the blanket and pulled it around her, her gaze vacant as she stared at the ceiling. The crystal chandelier above cast a bright light, making her face look as pale as paper.

The sound of running water from the bathroom was loud in the quiet room.

A short while later, Jackson emerged from the bathroom and entered the walk-in closet. When he came back out, he was dressed, sharp and impeccably put together.

The deep blue shirt fit him perfectly, and his trousers highlighted his long, lean legs. His features were sharp, almost sculpted, and his dark eyes were especially striking under the light.

Elaine had gathered herself by then. Apart from her slightly red eyes, she seemed composed.

Jackson pulled out a pen and paper, writing a check and placing it on the nightstand. His eyes were void of emotion.

""Leave your contact information when you leave. I'll call you if I need anything.""

He picked up his custom-made watch from the table and strapped it on, then walked toward the door. After taking a few steps, he stopped, not turning around. His voice was flat and distant.

""You should have done your homework before coming. Do you know what the rules are?""

She answered softly, ""I know.""

Jackson's women were only meant to last for three months. During that time, if he needed anything, they had to be available whenever he called. They couldn't visit him at his company or cause any trouble. After three months, they were to part ways without further contact.

Chapter7

Jackson's women had a shelf life of three months. During that time, if he needed anything, they had to be at his beck and call. They weren't allowed to visit him at his company or cause trouble. Once the three months were up, they were expected to leave and not look back.

Rumor had it that Jackson was cold and indifferent by nature, yet women still flocked to him, eager to get into his bed.

Not only was he rich and powerful, but he also treated women generously. After the three months were over, they were sent off with a generous severance package.

Jackson didn't linger. He opened the door and left.

Elaine picked up the check from the bedside table, staring at the figure written on it. A self-mocking smile tugged at her lips. 170 thousand dollars...

Because Cordell didn't need her, she had given the most precious thing she had to a stranger.

This man, in both looks and background, was no less impressive than Cordell, so she wasn't losing out, right?

Then why did it hurt so much? The kind of pain that came from being discarded but still unwilling to let go.

A cold tear slid down her cheek, and she bit her wrist, trying to stop herself from crying.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Valentine family estate had been passed down through generations. It was a grand, old house that resembled a castle, with ivy crawling up the red brick walls, the green vines bright and striking in the sunlight.

Tall, sturdy sycamore trees lined the yard, the flowerbeds were neat and beautiful, and the fountain sparkled like a goddess scattering flowers. In the summer, walking along the shady paths beneath the trees was cool and refreshing.

Elaine had a lounge chair set up by the flowerbed on the lawn. She sat quietly, reading a book, with a cup of coffee resting on the small glass table beside her. It was a scene of perfect peace, like stealing a few moments of blissful calm.

Olivia hurried over, her voice filled with excitement. ""Ms. Valentine, your father and grandfather are back.""

""I know,"" Elaine replied, closing her book. She composed herself and walked back to the living room.

In the living room, an elderly man in his sixties sat on the sofa, dressed in a traditional suit. He held a finely carved cane and wore a ring on his thumb, his graying hair perfectly groomed.

Beside him sat a couple who looked weary from travel. The man wore a suit, and the woman wore a deep purple dress, draped with a beige shawl. They exuded an air of wealth and elegance.

Elaine changed her shoes at the entrance and walked into the living room. ""Grandfather, Dad, Mom.""

Marcelo gave a brief nod. In contrast to his indifference, Constance Valentine eagerly stepped forward, gently touching Elaine's thin face, her eyes glistening with tears. ""Elaine, you've lost weight.""

Elaine opened her mouth, about to respond, but just then, a cold snort echoed through the quiet room.

She turned her gaze toward the sound, meeting the stern eyes of her grandfather Abraham Valentine, who glared at her. ""So, you finally decided to come back?""

She pressed her lips together and remained silent.

Abraham had never liked her.

After Constance lost a lot of blood during her birth and couldn't have more children, the male line of the Valentine family was cut off with Marcelo.

The Valentine family had vast wealth, and someone had to inherit it. Abraham had suggested that Marcelo take a mistress, have a son, and bring him into the family, paying the woman off and sending her away from Aleshire.

Marcelo and Constance had been high school classmates, and their relationship had been solid ever since. They started dating in college and had been happily married for many years.

Marcelo had firmly rejected Abraham's proposal, and the two often argued about it, to the point that Abraham once became so angry he had to be hospitalized.

Chapter8

Because of this, Marcelo had always been more affectionate toward Stacy than Elaine, treating her with indifference.

Moreover, since Abraham never liked her, Elaine was sent to live with her grandmother of the maternal line in Prarc Town when she was young. She stayed there until her grandmother passed away when she was thirteen, at which point she was brought back to the Valentine family.

Elaine stood stiffly, and Constance quickly stepped in to help. ""Dad, Elaine came back specifically for your 80th birthday, which is in two weeks. She wanted to wish you well."" She then shot Elaine a pointed look.

**‚ÄúSTORMTROOPER TRAINING SERIES: EPISODE 1 ‚Äî AIM FOR THE STARS (BUT MISS)‚Äù**

# Opening Camera Shot & Angle:

A **military-style tracking shot** glides past rows of recruits in white armor, clumsily fumbling with blasters.

In the background, a target dummy wobbles‚Ä¶ already riddled with shots in every direction *except* the bullseye.

# Location & Mood:

* **Setting:** *Imperial Firing Range #1138*
* **Light:** Harsh **fluorescent floodlights**, flickering just enough to make it feel like a cheap training facility
* **Sound:** Metallic boots clanking, intercom static‚Ä¶ and faintly, an off-key marching band playing the Imperial March
* **Temperature:** A stifling **86¬∞F** inside the plastoid armor, sweat dripping where no ventilation exists
* **Smell:** Burnt ozone from blaster misfires mixed with the unmistakable **scent of cafeteria meatloaf**

# Mission / Activity of the Day:

Today, the cadets must **pass their blaster accuracy trial** ‚Äî the one test Stormtroopers are *legendary* for failing. Armed with:

* **Prop/tool #1:** A **blaster rifle with the safety permanently stuck ‚Äúon‚Äù**
* **Prop/tool #2:** A **plastic training helmet visor so scratched it‚Äôs basically opaque**
* **Prop/tool #3:** A **clipboard with ‚ÄúTARGET PRACTICE‚Äù written in crayon**

# Dialogue (in character):

(*Focus Trooper raises blaster, squinting through scratched visor*)  
**STORMTROOPER:** ‚ÄúI see three targets‚Ä¶ guess I‚Äôll aim for the middle one?‚Äù

(*He fires, missing so wide it hits a nearby coffee machine*)  
**STORMTROOPER:** ‚ÄúDirect hit! ‚Ä¶wait. That wasn‚Äôt the dummy, was it?‚Äù

(\*He accidentally ejects the blaster power cell, dropping it with a loud *clunk*)  
**STORMTROOPER:** ‚ÄúOH NO‚Äîpermission to panic, sir?!‚Äù

# Mid-Video Twist / Interruption:

Just as the instructor announces the final accuracy round, **a mouse droid zips across the firing line, causing the entire squad to panic and unload wildly**. Sparks fly, walls collapse, and the instructor dives for cover, screaming:  
**‚ÄúSTOP SHOOTING EACH OTHER AND HIT THE TARGET!!‚Äù**

# Sound Design:

* **Authentic:** Blaster zaps, metal clanks, helmet comm static
* **Comedic:** *Cartoon ricochet sounds* for missed shots, *kazoo fart noise* when a blaster overheats, *boing* when a trooper slips on a spent power pack

# Closing Viral Hook:

Camera zooms on **our focus Stormtrooper proudly giving a thumbs-up**, even though his blaster is melted and the target dummy is completely untouched. Freeze-frame mid-thumbs-up.

On-screen text:  
**‚ÄúIMPERIAL MARKSMANSHIP: FAILURE IS THE STANDARD.‚Äù**

*Smash cut to black. Final sound: a single sad pew-pew.*

The anxiety I'm used to, and I haven't had an appetite for months, but I am getting frustrated with people telling me to eat, and it's all feeling mad. I've been off it for two days, due to travelling early in the morning and then waking up late, and I feel normal again and I've realised I hate it. I had a coffee today and felt that feeling again and it made me feel crazy. Like, I felt like me and my body were separated and I was crazy to think that.
I guess I just wondered if this feeling would pass over time, or if this is just what stimulants are like? To be clear, I will be mentioning all of this in my next appointment and I don't want medical/appointment advice, but I just want to know what everyone else was like at the beginning?

So me (22m) and my girlfriend (22f) have been going out for about a year. Everything was great at first, and she was super chill, but recently I feel like she's gotten a lot more clingy. 

Were both in college so we usually meet pretty frequently but I've been studying and working and I told her I wouldn't be able to see her as much during the summer. I hadn't seen her for about two weeks and she kept bugging me to meet until eventually she sent me a text complaining about how I never make the effort to meet and she always has to go out of her way if she wants to spend time with me. She was also mad that I sometimes go out with my friends instead of meeting her. 

She asked to see me once a week, and that we could get coffee or go to the beach, but I don't like either of those things, and I don't have enough money to go out for meals which is another thing she suggested. I told her that maybe I'd make plans with her if she gave me time to miss her and she got really quiet after that and isn't responding. 

Everything I said was true and I don't think she has a right to complain about me hanging out with my friends just because she's lonely. So aita?",0,1755483412.0,AmItheAsshole,8,0.33,False

That being said I think I‚Äôve come around at least within reason. What‚Äôs reason? No more than 1k, ideally around $750‚Ä¶.

Im kinda confused though because online reviews on Amazon for many models are not great. So, is a $750 DeLonghi Start twice as good as a $350 Phillips 2200? Online reviews suggest ‚ÄúNo‚Äù but then again You Tubers say yes. So what is it? 

I currently drink a good bit of coffee. I enjoy espresso, lattes, and plain coffee. That being said, I prefer a darker cup of joe. I‚Äôd like a machine that is fully automatic with a frother that can handle oat milk. I dont really want a wand frother. Reliability is also important since I‚Äôd make on average 5 cups a day. If I‚Äôm spending a lot of money I don‚Äôt want the machine to die within a couple months. 

So what‚Äôs right for me? Also, would it be advisable to wait till Black Friday? Or maybe a refurbished unit like a Jura Ena 4? (Any experience with factory refurbished units?)

There are so many choices and so many not great reviews that make the buying decision super complicated. On top of that, I dont want to be disappointed when unit busts.

1mt9ljj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ainovel/comments/1mt9ljj/onedollar_meal_movement_chapter_two_hot_dignity/,One-dollar Meal Movement -- Chapter Two: Hot Dignity Minutes,"**August 20, 2025 ‚Äî one week later**

The warehouse woke the way a body does when it remembers that breath is a choice. Lights came up slow, kettles shivered to life, and **Stargazer** exhaled its morning forecast across the floor in ghost-blue routes and amber cautions. The trucks‚Äî**Mercy**, **Hummingbird**, **Promise**, **Lumen**, **Badger**, **Sunflower**‚Äîsat like patient animals under the bay doors, frost beads sliding off their solar skins.

Avery Lin arrived with sleep still folded into the corners of her eyes and a paper cup of coffee she did not trust. She set the cup beside a tray of *mise en place* as if caffeine could steep from cumin. Then she did the thing she had done every morning since the first: put her palm flat on the steel counter and waited for the slight tremor that meant the building had remembered its job. The tremor came‚Äîa sympathetic vibration as the conveyor line spun up‚Äîand she let her hand fall away.

Above, the observation gallery glass held a faint smear of a palm print from last week‚Äôs ribbon knot. Beside the knot someone had scrawled with a grease pencil **ABUNDANCE RULES**, then smaller beneath it, **no gatekeeping**. No one had wiped it off. The words had become a policy and then a superstition and then a joke and then not a joke.

‚ÄúMorning, map,‚Äù Juno said, sliding a pallet of onions into position. She had a bruise climbing her wrist in yellow and green like a healing continent.

Avery nodded at the bruise. ‚ÄúDid a drum fight back?‚Äù

‚ÄúDoor fought my enthusiasm.‚Äù Juno bumped the pallet into place, the onions rolling against one another like a soft chorus. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre light on cabbage. Kiro says our secondary supplier has plenty but the truck hit a sinkhole big enough to swallow a mayor.‚Äù

‚ÄúStargazer?‚Äù Avery said to the air.

On the floor, a new vein blinked alive‚Äî**Sunflower** rerouted to the secondary supplier for a short pickup before crossing the Anacostia. *ETA shift: +11 minutes. Health tag influence minimal. Hot dignity minutes preserved.*

Avery smiled despite herself. Stargazer had picked up her phrase and turned it into an algorithmic sacrament. It quantified what could be felt and then made decisions to protect it. The machine understood that **temperature** and **time** weren‚Äôt just kitchen physics. They were respect.

‚ÄúCity wants me at noon,‚Äù Mariana said, appearing like a page turn. She held a yellow folder and the kind of expression bureaucrats wear when they have decided to be brave on purpose. ‚ÄúCouncil hearing. We made a graph. The ER saw twenty-eight percent fewer hypoglycemic collapses near your stops this week during distribution hours. It‚Äôs one week and correlation isn‚Äôt causation, but it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not nothing.‚Äù

Avery‚Äôs heart did a small, ridiculous flip. ‚ÄúNot nothing is my favorite datum.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get crushed on sodium, of course,‚Äù Mariana said, flipping the folder closed. ‚ÄúSoda money wants to cry ‚Äòsalt scare‚Äô while they carpet-bomb billboards with 72 grams of bliss. But bring your lid sensors and your pretty words.‚Äù

‚ÄúJuno,‚Äù Avery said. ‚ÄúDo we have‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Juno handed her a sealed bowl with the corner sensor glinting like a birthmark. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll label it **EXHIBIT A: DIGNITY**. Lawyers love capital letters.‚Äù

A notification strobed at the corner of Stargazer‚Äôs map. A color no one liked: a bruised purple.

**RUMOR VELOCITY: HIGH**  
*Text topic model: fertility/sterility, ‚Äúgovernment soup,‚Äù ‚ÄúQR tracking,‚Äù ‚Äúmakes men weak/children obedient.‚Äù Source clusters: pseudo-news FB pages, two podcasts, three burner accounts with matching n-grams. Counterfactual anchors: clinic nurses in Ward 7, pastors at New Bethel, ‚ÄòNana Lou‚Äô WhatsApp leader, Jackson‚Äôs Carryout owner.*

Avery‚Äôs stomach turned cold. The rumor had been inevitable; hunger‚Äôs old gatekeepers were not going to surrender market share because the city smelled like ginger. But it still made her want to knock something over.

‚ÄúDeploy the trust net,‚Äù she said.

Juno was already moving, fingers playing **Stargazer** like a piano. Screens split to show a cascade of small moving parts: text for pastors that used the right metaphors, a short vertical video of a nurse opening a bowl and taking a spoon with delight (recorded yesterday in case of exactly this), a schedule change so **Hummingbird** would stop at a corner where Nana Lou liked to hold court under a crepe myrtle. And a gigantic sign for the trucks‚Äô digital marquees, in clean white letters that did not beg: **NO PROOF OF NEED. NO ID. NO STRINGS. YOUR BODY, YOUR CHOICE. YOUR MEAL, YOURS.**

‚ÄúAlso,‚Äù Juno said, ‚ÄúOpen Kitchen Day. Today. Roll the doors. Invite the aunties to stick a finger in the stew and tell us if we used too much star anise.‚Äù

Mariana cocked an eyebrow. ‚ÄúInviting the public to violate the health code is an interesting strategy.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a tasting,‚Äù Juno said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a supervised intervention. We bring in the aunties in hairnets and gloves and put them on the line. They will trust what their hands have weighed.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Mariana said, half-smiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call it a Community Co-Production Event.‚Äù

‚ÄúMake a flyer,‚Äù Kiro said, stepping through a curtain of hanging lids like a magician revealing a rabbit. He wore his vest and an expression as calm as a refrigerator hum. ‚ÄúAlso, someone cut a camera on the alley. Midnight. Two hoodies bushwhacked at the plywood, then danced away when the lights came on. They‚Äôll be back with a lawyer and a ladder.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet them bring both,‚Äù Juno said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll hand them ladles.‚Äù

Kiro set a small evidence bag on the counter. Inside, a sticker: a cartoon milk-jug flexing a bicep, the word **NUTRIMAX** arched above it like a halo.

‚ÄúNutrimax,‚Äù Mariana said. ‚ÄúThe powdered meal people?‚Äù

‚ÄúEighty-nine-cent packets promising a month of vitality and less inconvenient hunger,‚Äù Kiro said. ‚ÄúThey opened a warehouse three miles from here and hired a PR firm with a taste for apostles. Their ‚Äòstreet teams‚Äô are stapling these to telephone poles.‚Äù

Avery looked at the sticker until the milk-jug‚Äôs smile went reptilian. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre selling emptiness that tastes like cake.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmptiness is profitable,‚Äù Juno said, quiet. ‚ÄúFullness breaks business models. We knew this.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we‚Äôll be better than business,‚Äù Avery said, and the sentence embarrassed her because it sounded like an undergraduate poster, but Juno didn‚Äôt laugh. She only bumped Avery‚Äôs shoulder with her own, deliberate.

‚ÄúAbundance rules, map,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs earn the T-shirt.‚Äù

At nine-twenty, **Hummingbird** pulled up to a brick wall painted with a mural of a woman cradling a river in her arms. Nana Lou stood in front of the mural in a lavender dress and a visor with rhinestones spelling **BLESS**. She was maybe sixty, maybe ageless, the sort of person who had already met every version of bullshit and turned it into soup.

‚ÄúCome on then,‚Äù she told the line that had materialized in five minutes. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if the government put them tiny robots in the stew to crawl up your ideas.‚Äù

The driver, a man with arms tattooed in gentle botanical drawings, passed her the first bowl. Nana Lou peeled the lid. The sensor pinged **hot**. She inhaled. ‚ÄúSmells like it remembers where your mama kept the good pan.‚Äù She took a spoon. The first taste was almost a prayer‚Äîyou could see her tongue find the ginger, the retraced sweetness of cabbage cooked just short of surrender, the quiver of sesame. She swallowed, cut her eyes sideways to make them strangers to one another, then took a second spoon in case truth required replication.

‚ÄúNan?‚Äù a young woman near the front asked, eyes narrow with the effort of pretending not to hope. ‚ÄúYou gettin‚Äô paid to say it‚Äôs good?‚Äù

‚ÄúChild,‚Äù Nana Lou said, loud enough for the alley on both sides to hear. ‚ÄúIf somebody pays me, I will tell you. Government pays me? I‚Äôll die on that hill in a sequined suit. This here tastes like my cousin‚Äôs after she got saved and stopped cooking with anger.‚Äù She turned to the man at the edge of the circle who had a Nutrimax packet peeking guiltily from his shirt pocket. She tapped the packet with her spoon. ‚ÄúIf powder wants to come in my house, it can make me a biscuit and a story. Until then it can sit on a shelf like a lonely orphan.‚Äù

The line laughed‚Äîthe particular laughter that pulls shame up by the root and replaces it with belonging. The packet man grinned, sheepish but looser now, and took a bowl. The rumor, at least on that corner, lost some oxygen.

By noon, three aunties in hairnets were running Avery‚Äôs line like they had been born with stainless-steel hands. They corrected the salt with a look and the star anise with a sniff. They told Juno the carrots wanted to be a little less oblivious. They clucked at the lid fight and taught a teenage volunteer how to seat the seal with a twist of wrist that looked like turning a child‚Äôs face toward a camera. They did not care for the boil-over alarms. ‚ÄúThe pot,‚Äù one of them said, ‚Äúwill tell you when it‚Äôs angry.‚Äù

At the city council, the chamber smelled like freshly printed paper and expectation. Mariana spoke in graphs and gentle severity. When the soda lobbyist lifted an eyebrow at **hot dignity minutes**, she did not flinch.

‚ÄúWe are measuring the difference between handing someone a cold thing they can‚Äôt eat right away and handing them a hot thing they can,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are measuring kindness in units you can budget around.‚Äù

Avery stood when called. She held up the bowl with the lid sensor. She spoke about **BreadChain** without saying the words *blockchain* or *crypto* or any syllable that would turn a public hearing into a Twitter fight. She said: *we can trace every bowl from the pot to the person, and when we make a mistake, we can pull it back without drama*. She said: *trust is our most expensive ingredient and we chose to spend it anyway*. She quoted a text she had received‚Äî**tasted like my mother‚Äôs soup, but without the worry**‚Äîand she watched one councilmember‚Äôs throat move the way a father‚Äôs does when he remembers a winter he couldn‚Äôt buy enough heat.

A representative from Nutrimax spoke, too. He had a jaw you could hang a suit on and a PowerPoint with starbursts. He talked about *efficiency* and *personal responsibility* and *taste-neutral delivery mechanisms*. He said *poverty is a market failure; we are a market correction*. He said *we are proud to support our partner faith communities* and flashed a photo of a pastor holding a packet like a chalice.

Avery did not say *taste-neutral is a slow death*. She did not say *your packets taste like the inside of a filing cabinet*. She did not say anything that would make a clip for someone‚Äôs rage reel. She only spoke once, to ask whether the Nutrimax packets contained **potassium** enough to balance the sodium of the rest of a poor person‚Äôs diet. The representative said *our proprietary blend is optimized for palate adherence*. Mariana coughed into her sleeve hard enough to be mistaken for a laugh.

After, in the hallway, three newspaper reporters asked Avery if she was starting a war with powder. She thought of the sticker on Kiro‚Äôs desk and of the woman with plum nails who had sent the chain her blessing last week, and she said, ‚ÄúWe are starting a kitchen.‚Äù

By sunset, **Stargazer** pulsed with a satisfactions graph that looked like the first bars of a song someone would remember. The rumor maps had cooled from purple to sullen lavender to a splotched, embarrassed gray. In places where the rumor persisted, **Stargazer** ran a different kind of intervention: history. It re-routed **Promise** to stop at a mural about vaccination in the old hospital district. It pushed an alert to the truck speakers to play a recording of a great-grandmother telling the truth about polio. It sent Nana Lou a coupon for ice cream to hand to the man with the loudest mouth, with a small note that read *this is what abundance feels like*.

On the loading dock, Avery found Kiro with a printout of access logs. He had the air of a man who had discovered that the floor plan of a house had teeth.

‚ÄúThey tried to fork the bread,‚Äù he said, dry. He put the printout on the steel table. It showed a series of identical bowl IDs appearing simultaneously at two locations on opposite sides of the river. A classic double-spend attack for soup.

‚ÄúDid they redeem?‚Äù Avery asked.

Kiro smiled without showing teeth. ‚ÄúOur lids blush more than our volunteers. The first scan turned the second red. They filmed the red lid and tried to post it with a caption **FAKE FOOD FOR FAKE POOR**. Our fact-checkers were waiting in the replies with the raw log and a video from the true time and place, and also a baby goat.‚Äù

‚ÄúA baby goat?‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople share baby goats. The truth needs allies.‚Äù

Avery leaned on the table and let the relief wash through her like a benign fever. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll escalate,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúThey will,‚Äù Kiro said. ‚ÄúSo will we.‚Äù

He pointed to a corner of the printout. A tiny annotation from Juno: **teach the lids to sing**. When a bowl turned red, the lid would chime a soft, distinct tone‚Äînot a siren, not shaming, just a sonic cue that something had gone wrong and would be made right. Dignity infrastructure extended even to failure modes. The whole system smelled faintly of sesame and forethought.

A beep from above: a drone, built from donated parts and teenage bravado, tipped sideways and righted itself like a bird learning it had wings. The students had programmed it to wink its navigation lights in the rhythm of a lullaby. It landed on the roof with a clumsy pride.

On the alley wall opposite the bay, someone had already added to the grease-pencil credo. **ABUNDANCE RULES** had acquired a footnote: **and so do we**. It was equal parts manifesto and cheer.

Avery thought of the predictions she had scribbled in a notebook she did not show anyone. Year One: **Hot Dignity Minutes** as a public metric; ER collapses down a third near routes during meal hours; attendance up in after-school programs; petty theft of food down; *Nutrimax* pivots to ‚Äúpartner‚Äù and quietly exits. Year Two: copycat kitchens in half the states, then in other countries; **BreadChain** becomes a standard like handwashing logs; insurance companies subsidize bowls because claims drop; cities rewrite codes to treat kitchens as infrastructure. Year Three: **Abundance Rules** turns from motto to municipal law in one city; the rumor industry shifts its attention because there is no money in slander where there is no scarcity; a senator who once laughed at hot dignity minutes pins a campaign on them. Year Four: robots that can stir without scorching; lids that biodegrade into tomato food; school cafeterias retrofit; **Stargazer** becomes **Constellation** as Lagos and Manila and Porto Alegre light up on the map. Year Five: a global shortage of angry, chronic hunger; an unexpected surplus of quiet afternoons.

And alongside those lines she had written the other column, the one that kept her honest: drought, flood, knives, courts, a truck on fire, a whisper of plague in a camp, a packet-seller with a megaphone and a claim that tasted like candy, a cut to a budget, a kid who jokes about **BreadChain** and finds himself sued by someone who pretends not to understand humor. Two columns, one plan: keep cooking.

Juno climbed up beside her on the loading dock, swinging her legs in a way that betrayed the teenager she had once been, the one who had fed a house full of siblings from a pantry that was mostly air.

‚ÄúCouncil?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúGood-ish,‚Äù Avery said. ‚ÄúSoda wants to save us from salt. Nutrimax wants to diet the poor into submission. Mariana said **Hot Dignity Minutes** like she was pronouncing a verdict. The room leaned forward.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said your beautiful sentences?‚Äù

‚ÄúI hid them under napkins.‚Äù

Juno pulled a folded napkin from her pocket. In Avery‚Äôs handwriting: **We will be as boring as a municipal water plant. We will be as beloved as a corner bodega. We will outlast your appetite for drama.**

‚ÄúYou left it on the counter,‚Äù Juno said. ‚ÄúI took it before the monk turned it into calligraphy.‚Äù

They watched **Sunflower** slide back under the bay with a soft hum, its tires whispering secrets to the concrete.

A small boy appeared at the edge of the dock, one shoelace untied, holding a bowl like a question. He looked at Avery with the practiced seriousness of children whose world has taught them to audit adult promises.

‚ÄúI brought this back,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou gave me two because I said my brother was coming. But he fell asleep. Nana Lou says bring it back if it ain‚Äôt hot no more, and you‚Äôll make a new one in the morning.‚Äù

Avery took the bowl with both hands like a holy thing. The lid sensor blinked a sleepy blue. She could have told him to keep it for breakfast cold; she could have told him it was fine. Instead she said, ‚ÄúThank you. You just made the algorithm smarter.‚Äù

The boy looked satisfied in the deeply adult way that means **I knew I could be trusted**. He tapped the lid. ‚ÄúTomorrow I get two again, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúTomorrow,‚Äù Avery said, ‚Äúyou get three. One for you, one for your brother, and one for Nana Lou.‚Äù

He considered, then nodded. Fairness, in his economy, had expanded.

A siren unspooled somewhere distant in the night and then tucked itself away. The trucks‚Äô thermal cameras clicked over to standby. The kettles sighed.

‚ÄúDo you hear that?‚Äù Juno said softly.

‚ÄúThe pressure in the lines?‚Äù Avery asked.

‚ÄúThe sound of a city digesting.‚Äù

They sat together quite still, listening for the new noises: stainless settling, laughter echoing from the volunteer room, the monk humming as he hung his wet sleeves by the vent. The rumor machine ground its gears out there in the dark, but the kitchen machine ground chickpeas and carrots and cabbage and turned them into proof.

Avery‚Äôs phone lit. A message from the backer: **Saw the hearing. ‚ÄòHot dignity minutes‚Äô is the best KPI I‚Äôve ever met. Add ESG as ‚ÄòEat Soup, Globally‚Äô. Kidding. Mostly.** Then, a second: **You‚Äôll need a second hub by October. Let‚Äôs build in Detroit. I know a plant that wants to be a kitchen.**

Avery stared at the screen until the letters settled into the shape of work. Detroit. An old ribcage of a building learning to be a lung. She could see **Moby Soup** there, larger; she could see new trucks with new names‚Äî**Motor**, **Grit**, **Aretha**, **Riveter**‚Äîand a river of bowls finding hands that had made the engines that made a century.

She typed back: **We‚Äôll need aunties. And a Nana.**

A beat, then: **Find them. Abundance rules.**

Avery pocketed the phone, stood, and stretched her sore shoulders. The bruise on Juno‚Äôs wrist had become a map of a continent where the rivers had found the sea.

‚ÄúTomorrow at five,‚Äù Juno said, hopping off the dock. ‚ÄúBring your beautiful sentences. We‚Äôll hide them under lids.‚Äù

‚ÄúTomorrow,‚Äù Avery said.

In her head, the future began to spool in sentences that she would not yet write.

*When Lagos goes hot we will teach the tides to carry bowls.*  
*When the rumor calls us sterile, we will have a parade of babies with cabbage-stained bibs.*  
*When the powder men come with biceps printed on their packets, we will give them spoons and let their bodies decide.*  
*When the city learns to measure dignity, it will forget how to budget shame.*  
*When the first school year closes with every child fed hot at 3 p.m., the teachers will cry in the custodian closet and call it a flood.*  
*When the tenth city opens, the map will stop being a map and become a pulse.*

The night smelled like sesame and rain again. The alley cat that had watched the first morning from the fence leapt down, inspected a fallen cabbage leaf, and made a face as dramatic as an opera. It would eat the leaf tomorrow, when the trucks were gone and the city‚Äôs hunger had tipped a little.

Avery walked the length of the dock, touching each truck on the hood as if blessing a strange congregation. **Mercy**, **Hummingbird**, **Promise**, **Lumen**, **Badger**, **Sunflower**. Machines with names like virtues, holding a human invention: a way of turning abundance into a rule.

She paused at the bay door and looked back. On the glass above, the grease-pencil words glowed in reflected orange. **ABUNDANCE RULES.** And under that, someone had drawn a small bowl with steam rising in three curved lines. A child‚Äôs hand, probably. Or a volunteer‚Äôs. Or a monk‚Äôs.

Avery clicked the sign to **WE‚ÄôLL BE BACK AT 5 AM** and thought of the human race as a kitchen that had forgotten it could cook for everyone. She thought: **we‚Äôre teaching ourselves our own recipe**.

And the ledger ticked, and the city digested, and the rumor machine got bored for a minute because the stew was hot and the hands were kind, and this is how futures start: with a bowl that arrives on time.",1,1755483297.0,ainovel,0,1.0,False

1mt9jc9,https://i.redd.it/l39sp9repojf1.jpeg,DEVLOG August 11-17,"**MY PROGRESS:**

I have almost completed my goal minimum: I have made a working message spawner and have implemented two timers. One is an interval timer to spawn the messages and the second one is the countdown timer, that completes the entire in-game ""work day"" (3 minutes of play time). The problem is the countdown timer doesn't stop but launches the loop again, so the messages keep spawning even though I can clearly see the debug string that the countdown timer shoots. 

  
I have also implemented the chances of different message spawn. To achieve the desired game balance they need to be following: 

* Tickets 54%
* Pings 28%
* Mail 18%

So now I have defined it as a game of chance. It is s dice roll within an interval 0-1. <= 0.54 spawns a ticket, <= 0.28 spawns a ping and <= 0.18 spawns a mail. This is not ideal because game of chance doesn't guarantee the proportion.

  
**NEW MEMBER**

I am getting some help from my lifelong childhood friend. Back in the days we were involved into making some easy browser games, and he went the path of a programmer. Ai HR Clara would be glad to onboard this valuable human asset.   
He has offered a completely new principle of message generation. We need to generate the entire deck of messages to show them gradually to the player. This way the proportion will be guaranteed. It removes away the game of chance element. I will think further what is the best game design decision. 

Goal for the next week is to move further in definition of the main architecture of this cornerstone gameplay decisions.

1mt9hut,https://www.reddit.com/r/SadhguruTruth/comments/1mt9hut/how_isha_stages_the_audience_questions_to_sadhguru/,How Isha stages the audience questions to Sadhguru,"It was in 2016 that I first learnt that some of the audience questions to Sadhguru were routinely staged by Isha. Sadhguru was visiting the US at that time and had several public sessions. In one of the sessions, a completely non-spiritual question was asked - ""What do you think of Donald Trump?"" or some version of it. A friend (who was a volunteer at the event) told me that that question was pre-written along with a few others! He even described how the teacher (I won't name her!) trained them on how they should be sitting in the audience, how to ask the question and who should pass on the mic to them!

I remember myself thinking that it was silly. We both joked about it and wondered why such a stupid question was chosen. If you are staging questions, why not choose a relevant spiritual question that would benefit everyone? Who cares what Sadhguru thinks about Trump? **But we left it at that - we didn't doubt Sadhguru or Isha. Our trust in Sadhguru was not shaken a bit.**

Just yesterday, I saw a video of an ex-Isha volunteer describing how he lost his trust when he witnessed how the questions to Sadhguru were staged:

>Sadhguru gave a Satsung on the new¬†year's eve of 2024.  When it came to asking the questions and¬†answers,¬†people were asking a lot of things¬†but the mic that was given to one of¬†the volunteers who was sitting¬†right beside me. I could see in his¬†WhatsApp group that he was sent some¬†questions to ask! **It literally blew¬†me¬†that some of the things that are being¬†asked have been staged!¬†I don't know if Sadhguru is¬†aware of it but I think in a¬†lot of ways he is.** But what I saw really¬†took the respect out of the center¬†for me because when something is staged¬†for popularity or for marketing it just isn't natural.  You're just¬†talking about things so that you can get¬†eyes on you!

This chap's experience with Isha and his opinions are not relevant here, but the fact that Isha stages questions is (Those interested can watch the video here - https://youtu.be/pg82O3u4Utk?t=724). Kudos to this guy for seeing through the whole charade instantly. He reminds me of the [chap](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/guruphiliac/sadhguru-and-the-isha-foundation-t2073569-s200.html#p709) who left Sadhguru when he realized that Sadhguru loves coffee and drinks it obsessively while preaching about not being slave to coffee! **These folks didn't ""rationalize"" or ""trivialize"" the red-flags they saw. They were lucky and their life somehow led them to realize the truth quickly**. Not everyone is so fortunate!

I believe many volunteers are aware of this practice of staging questions but they don't see anything wrong with it. I have actually seen (I think on X) someone defending this practice by arguing something like - *""Not all questions are staged. Only a few. It is required to keep the sessions interesting and on topic!"".*  Oh, ya, Donald Trump is a very relevant topic for Sadhguru right?

1mt9hpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntingJob/comments/1mt9hpm/the_smart_job_seekers_digital_playbook_mastering/,The Smart Job Seeker's Digital Playbook: Mastering Modern Career Transitions,"# Introduction: The New Reality of Career Navigation

The job market has undergone a radical transformation. What worked five years ago might now be obsolete. Today's successful job seekers aren't just applying online‚Äîthey're building digital brands, leveraging AI tools, and creating strategic visibility campaigns. This guide reveals the tactics that actually work in today's hyper-competitive digital job market.

# Part 1: Building Your Digital Foundation

# Creating a Powerful Online Presence

Your digital footprint is your first impression. Before you send a single application, audit and optimize your online presence. Start by Googling yourself‚Äîwhat appears on the first page? Potential employers will see exactly this.

Professional headshots matter more than ever. With smartphones capable of portrait mode, there's no excuse for grainy profile pictures. Maintain consistency across all platforms‚Äîuse the same photo on LinkedIn, professional Twitter accounts, and any industry-specific networks.

# The Multi-Platform Strategy

LinkedIn remains crucial, but smart job seekers diversify. GitHub showcases technical skills. Behance displays creative portfolios. Medium demonstrates thought leadership. Choose platforms that align with your industry and maintain active, professional presences on each.

Consider creating a personal website using platforms like Carrd or Linktree. This central hub can direct employers to all your professional content, from portfolio pieces to published articles. Include a downloadable PDF resume‚Äîtools like [www.hhired.org](http://www.hhired.org) can help you create professional, ATS-optimized resumes that you can easily export and share. Keep your contact information clear and accessible across all platforms.

# Part 2: The Hidden Job Market Revolution

# Understanding the 70% Rule

Research indicates that approximately 70% of positions are never publicly advertised. These opportunities exist in what professionals call the ""hidden job market."" Accessing these positions requires strategic networking and proactive outreach rather than passive application submission.

# Strategic Company Targeting

Instead of scrolling through job boards, identify 20-30 companies where you'd genuinely want to work. Research their growth trajectories, recent funding rounds, and departmental expansions. Set up Google Alerts for company news and follow key executives on LinkedIn.

When companies announce new projects, expansions, or funding, they often need talent before formal job postings appear. Reaching out during these growth moments positions you ahead of the competition.

# The Coffee Chat Strategy

Virtual coffee chats have replaced traditional informational interviews. Request 15-minute video calls with professionals in your target companies. Focus on learning about their challenges and company culture rather than asking for jobs directly. These conversations often lead to referrals when positions open.

# Part 3: Application Optimization in the AI Era

# Beating the Algorithm

Applicant Tracking Systems scan for specific keywords, but modern systems also analyze context and relevance. Instead of keyword stuffing, integrate industry terminology naturally throughout your resume. Use the exact job title from the posting somewhere in your resume, even if your previous title differed slightly.

Format matters critically for ATS parsing. Avoid headers, footers, and text boxes. Stick to standard fonts like Arial or Calibri. Using a professional resume builder like [www.hhired.org](http://www.hhired.org) ensures your resume is automatically formatted for ATS compatibility while maintaining visual appeal for human reviewers. Save your resume as both PDF and Word documents‚Äîsome systems prefer one format over the other.

# The Power of the T-Format Cover Letter

Traditional paragraph-style cover letters get skimmed. Consider the T-format: create two columns with ""Your Requirements"" on the left and ""My Qualifications"" on the right. This visual format makes it immediately clear why you're a perfect match.

# Portfolio Integration

Even non-creative roles benefit from work samples. Create a simple Google Drive folder with 3-5 relevant examples. Include a one-page project summary for each, explaining your role, challenges faced, and measurable outcomes. Share the link in your application materials.

# Part 4: Mastering Virtual Interview Dynamics

# Technical Excellence

Test your setup days before the interview. Position your camera at eye level‚Äîstack books under your laptop if necessary. Invest in a basic ring light ($20-30) for professional lighting. Use wired internet connections when possible to avoid connectivity issues.

Practice with the specific platform beforehand. Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet each have unique features. Know how to share your screen, mute/unmute efficiently, and troubleshoot basic issues.

# The STAR+ Method

While the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) remains valuable, add a plus: Learning. Conclude each story by sharing what you learned and how you've applied that knowledge since. This demonstrates growth mindset and self-awareness.

# Virtual Presence Techniques

Maintain eye contact by looking at the camera, not the screen. Place a small arrow pointing to your camera as a reminder. Keep a glass of water nearby but out of frame. Have a printed copy of your resume and the job description within reach but out of sight.

# Part 5: Strategic Follow-Through

# The Three-Touch System

After applying, implement the three-touch system:

1. Immediate confirmation (within 24 hours)
2. Value-add follow-up (after one week)
3. Final check-in (after two weeks)

For the value-add follow-up, share a relevant article or insight about the company's industry. This demonstrates ongoing interest and industry knowledge without seeming pushy.

# Building Your Advisory Board

Identify 5-7 professionals who can provide guidance during your search. Include people from different industries and career stages. Schedule monthly check-ins to maintain relationships and receive diverse perspectives on your search strategy.

# Part 6: Negotiation in the Digital Age

# Research Leverage

Use platforms like Glassdoor, [Salary.com](http://Salary.com), and Payscale to understand compensation ranges. But go deeper‚Äîanalyze LinkedIn profiles of current employees to understand typical career progressions and tenure. This information provides negotiation ammunition beyond just salary.

# The Complete Package Approach

Modern compensation extends beyond base salary. Negotiate for professional development budgets, flexible work arrangements, equity participation, and technology stipends. Create a total compensation worksheet to evaluate offers holistically.

# Virtual Negotiation Tactics

Video negotiations require different strategies than in-person discussions. Use strategic pauses‚Äîthey're less awkward on video than in person. Have your research visible on a second screen. Record the conversation (with permission) to review specific details later.

# Part 7: Continuous Career Development

# The Always-Be-Ready Mindset

Successful professionals maintain ""interview readiness"" even when happily employed. Update your resume quarterly‚Äîplatforms like [**www.hihired.org**](https://www.hihired.org/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social) make it easy to maintain multiple versions of your resume tailored for different opportunities. Keep a running document of accomplishments with specific metrics. Maintain your network through regular, authentic engagement.

This proactive approach means you're never starting from scratch when opportunities arise. Having an updated, professional resume ready to customize saves crucial time when perfect positions appear unexpectedly.

# Skill Gap Analysis

Every quarter, analyze job postings for your dream positions. Identify recurring requirements you don't yet meet. Use platforms like Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, or industry-specific training to continuously close these gaps.

# Building Your Digital Advisory Network

Follow industry thought leaders on LinkedIn and Twitter. Engage meaningfully with their content. Join professional Slack communities and Discord servers in your field. These digital relationships often lead to unexpected opportunities.

# Conclusion: Your Personalized Action Plan

Success in the modern job market requires systematic effort rather than sporadic activity. Create a weekly schedule:

**Monday:** Research and identify new target companies **Tuesday:** Network outreach and relationship building **Wednesday:** Application customization and submission (use tools like [www.hhired.org](http://www.hhired.org) to quickly tailor resumes for each position) **Thursday:** Skill development and learning **Friday:** Follow-ups and relationship maintenance

Track your efforts using a simple spreadsheet or apps like Huntr or JibberJobber. Monitor what's working and adjust your strategy accordingly.

Remember, job searching in the digital age isn't about applying to hundreds of positions‚Äîit's about strategic visibility, authentic relationship building, and continuous skill development. The professionals who thrive are those who treat their job search as a strategic campaign rather than a desperate scramble.

Your next opportunity might come from a LinkedIn comment, a virtual coffee chat, or a well-timed email to a growing company. Stay persistent, remain authentic, and trust the process. The digital age has made job searching more complex, but it's also created unprecedented opportunities for those who master its dynamics.",2,1755482994.0,HuntingJob,0,1.0,False

1mt98xj,https://i.redd.it/nw8a69h3qojf1.png,Surprising my Boyfriend with My Wedding Without Him. Anyone has the free reading link to this story?,"‚ÄúMom, about what Dad said years ago‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve decided to go through with it. Tell him to arrange the marriage.‚Äù

I ended the call, and the music flooded back in. Audrey‚Äôs birthday party was still in full swing.

Audrey‚Äîthe girl I once saved from bullies, who I thought was my best friend.

Jared, my boyfriend, and Jackson, my closest childhood friend, changed the moment Audrey entered our lives. Suddenly, she was their everything. They laughed with her, cared for her‚Ä¶ and eventually, they told me they loved her. Right to my face.

Then came the dinner. Just the three of us. A final attempt to fix things‚Äîso I thought. But when Audrey called, crying about being robbed, they left me. Again.

It was raining. I wandered the streets, soaked and alone, until I was hit by a car. They never even bothered checking on me.

So I packed my bags. Booked a flight. Met my groom.

Then I sent Jared and Jackson one last message: My Wedding Invitation.

\--

‚ÄúAbout what father said years ago‚Ä¶‚Äù I paused, my voice barely rising above the music thumping through the villa walls. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm now agreeing to get married. Please tell him to arrange all the prep work. No need for romance‚Äîmake it just formal.‚Äù

There was a moment of stunned silence on the other end before my mother‚Äôs familiar voice broke through. ‚ÄúAre you sure about this? What about your boyfriend, Jared? Did you finally break up with him?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù I replied, firm but tired. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell anyone about this yet.‚Äù I swallowed the ache in my throat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send the other list for the agreement and return home as soon as possible.‚Äù

Then I hung up. The phone slid from my hand and dropped onto the soft mattress beside me. That‚Äôs when the noise outside clawed its way back into my senses.

It was Audrey‚Äôs birthday. The adopted daughter of my parents. The girl I once thought of as my little sister. The same girl I‚Äôd defended from bullies back in high school, when the four of us‚Äîme, Audrey, and my childhood friends Jared and Jackson‚Äîwere supposed to be a family.

Back then, I thought I was doing the right thing. That helping her would bring us closer. That we could all live in one house and laugh over dinner. I never imagined she‚Äôd twist everything.

Audrey was clever like that. She‚Äôd wormed her way into everything. She used to tag along with us‚Äîme, Jared, and Jackson. I didn‚Äôt mind. At first. But then it was like she started trying to replace me. Whispering things to Jared when I wasn‚Äôt looking. Making Jackson laugh in a way that used to be just mine. Still, I told myself not to overthink it.

But then I saw it. The kiss. It was supposed to be a quiet night. Just me and Jared who eventually became my boyfriend as we both confessed our love. Then, I caught him and Audrey kissing.

I let it go‚Äîfor a while. But it happened again. And again.

Every time I asked, Jared brushed it off. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just jealous,‚Äù he‚Äôd say. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs like a sister.‚Äù

Jackson said the same. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ruin everything because you‚Äôre being insecure, Maureen.‚Äù

But it wasn‚Äôt insecurity. It was betrayal.

And now, here I was‚Äîalone at her birthday party. Watching the three of them giggle and clink glasses like they were the main characters in some twisted romantic comedy. Jared had just taken a shot‚Äîand with a laugh, he pressed the empty glass to Audrey‚Äôs lips, his free hand grazing her body as if they were already lovers.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I got up and quietly slipped back into one of the guest rooms upstairs. But just as I was pulling the blanket over my head, the door creaked open.

‚ÄúMaureen?‚Äù Audrey‚Äôs voice was laced with fake concern. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre looking for you downstairs. We‚Äôre about to do the fireworks.‚Äù

I stayed still. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired and sleepy. Just go.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on‚Ä¶‚Äù She stepped closer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my birthday. Are you really going to be like this?‚Äù

I turned to face her, my voice low. ‚ÄúAudrey, isn‚Äôt it enough that I was forced to be here?‚Äù

She frowned. ‚ÄúDo you really hate me now? Is it because you think I stole them from you? That was never my intention. Please‚Ä¶ we used to be best friends‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù I held up my hand. ‚ÄúJust go enjoy your party.‚Äù

But she wouldn‚Äôt. She grabbed my wrist, tugging. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go. It‚Äôll be fun. I‚Äôm happy when you‚Äôre with me‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me!‚Äù I tried to yank away, but her grip tightened.

In the struggle, we lost balance. We both fell backward‚ÄîAudrey crashing into the small table beside the bed. The vase on top tipped and shattered, the shards slicing into our arms and shoulders.

Pain bloomed down my forearm, but before I could react, the door flew open.

My boyfriend Jared. He didn‚Äôt rush to me. No. He ran to her.

‚ÄúAre you okay? Audrey‚Äîwhat happened?!‚Äù he asked, checking her wounds, brushing the glass from her skin.

‚ÄúShe pushed me,‚Äù Audrey whimpered. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äîshe just‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the heck, Maureen?!‚Äù Jared turned to me with a snarl. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ruining everything. Again.‚Äù

I stared at him, speechless. Blood dripping from my hand.

‚ÄúShe attacked me,‚Äù I said, shaking. ‚ÄúShe pulled me. I told her to stop‚Äî‚Äù

But he wasn‚Äôt listening. Neither was Jackson, who had now joined them. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always like this,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúJealous. Dramatic. Can‚Äôt stand not being the center of attention.‚Äù

Then I was told to apologize. Even with blood soaking through my sleeves, I was the one ruining her birthday.

Jackson grabbed me by the arm. ‚ÄúCome on. You‚Äôre coming downstairs. We‚Äôre celebrating. You‚Äôre not going to embarrass the family again.‚Äù

So I went. Bruised, bleeding, humiliated‚ÄîI stood beneath the fireworks, watching them laugh and dance.

Just one last time, I thought. One last time, I‚Äôll try. I joined the circle by the bonfire, fake smile painted on like war paint.

The music swelled. People cheered. I was swaying, barely holding it together when I felt the shove. Jared pushed me? How‚Ä¶ why?

I stumbled straight into the bonfire‚Äôs edge. Pain exploded up my arm as flames kissed my skin.

I screamed.

Someone screamed with me‚ÄîAudrey. She rushed to my side, panicked. ‚ÄúOh, god! Maureen is hurt! We need to call an ambulance‚Äîshe‚Äôs hurt‚Äî‚Äù

But Jared stepped in, shaking his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. Just a small burn. She‚Äôll get by. It‚Äôs her punishment for hurting you a while ago.""

And Jackson? He didn‚Äôt even look at me.

No one helped.

I dragged myself away from the fire. Then I hailed a cab.

No one offered to take me to the hospital. No one cared that I was bleeding.

But that was fine‚Ä¶ because this is the last time they‚Äôre going to hurt me again.

Chapter 2

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing you came in right away,‚Äù the nurse said as she gently cleaned the raw skin of my arm. ‚ÄúThis is a second-degree burn, and you needed stitches too.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond. Just nodded. The white ceiling above me blurred. I stayed at the hospital for two more days.

Not a call. Not a single message. No ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù No ‚ÄúSorry for what happened.‚Äù

Nothing. They didn‚Äôt even care enough to pretend.

On the second evening, I found myself aimlessly scrolling through my phone. Maybe some part of me still hoped they‚Äôd reached out. But all I found were photos.

Bright, glowing snapshots of Audrey in her brand-new red dress, smiling between Jared and Jackson. Champagne glasses raised. That same smirk on her lips that she always wore when she knew she had won.

‚ÄúThank you Jared and Jackson for the best birthday ever! I‚Äôll treasure this forever! Look at our new friendship bracelets!!!‚Äù

I zoomed in. Three matching bracelets. And then Jared and Jackson no longer wore our friendship bracelets like before.

I turned off the screen and placed the phone face down on the side table. Just silence again. My heart pounded in that silence. But it didn‚Äôt hurt anymore. It was just‚Ä¶ empty.

Two days later, I was back at the apartment. The same place we‚Äôd all moved into after college. It was supposed to be a home for a family, only that they had betrayed me.

I stepped inside the quiet living room and headed straight to my bedroom. I opened the closet and began to pack.

I reached for my shoes and then paused. There it was‚Äîthe memory box. That dumb, stupid box I had once called my ""treasure chest.""

I sat on the floor, dragging it out, letting the dust coat my fingers. Inside were letters. Crumpled, faded ones written by Jared and Jackson from when we were kids. Stick drawings, silly poems, ‚Äúget well soon‚Äù cards when I had the flu.

And a photo. The three of us‚Äîme, Jared, and Jackson‚Äîkneeling by a treehouse, dirt on our clothes, wide grins across our faces.

I remembered that day. It was the summer I got bit by a dog. Or almost did. I was always terrified of dogs, and the neighbor‚Äôs dog had gotten loose. I froze, too scared to move. Jared and Jackson had jumped in front of me like it was instinct. Jared even got a bite on his arm just to protect me.

After that, everything changed. They became my shadows. My protectors. And somewhere along the way, I had fallen in love with Jared, while Jackson treated me like a sister.

Until Audrey ruined everything.

I sat on the floor, gripping a friendship bracelet with my name on it. I was such a fool.

My parents had warned me when I begged them to adopt Audrey. ‚ÄúAre you sure about this, Maureen? Not everyone wants a sister the way you do. And what if she hurts you? You can‚Äôt just trust anyone that easy.‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt listened. I believed love would be enough.

But now?

Now I knew.

She didn‚Äôt want to be my sister. She wanted to be me.

I packed up the rest of my things. Then, I carried the memory box outside. I set the box down and lit the match in the backyard.

The flames caught quickly. The letters curled, blackening. The bracelets twisted in the heat, their gold sheen turning dull and dead. The photos dissolved into ash.

‚ÄúMaureen!‚Äù

I turned at the sound of Jared‚Äôs voice. He came running from inside, panic written all over his face.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúAre those‚Ä¶ are those our albums?! The bracelets?!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said simply. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm burning all our memories.‚Äù

He tried to move closer, but I stepped in front of the fire, blocking him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over. All of it.‚Äù

Jackson arrived seconds later, looking just as stunned.

‚ÄúIs this some kind of tantrum?‚Äù he asked, arms crossed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre upset, we get it. But this is dramatic, even for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a tantrum,‚Äù I said, my voice calm, steady. ‚ÄúThis is the end.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really going to let one bad night ruin years of friendship?‚Äù Jared asked. ‚ÄúMaureen, don‚Äôt do this. We can talk‚Äî‚Äù

I met their gaze before turning to Jared. ‚ÄúI don't want to ever be with the both of you again.""

I turned away and walked back inside the apartment, the smoke still curling behind me.

Chapter 3

I thought they‚Äôd leave me alone after I burned everything. But they didn‚Äôt.

Days passed, and slowly, Jared started acting like nothing had happened. He began sending flowers again. He texted like a sweet boyfriend, asked about my day, and even tried to kiss me once when we crossed paths outside the building. It was as if nothing had ever gone wrong.

Jackson followed suit, playing the big brother again‚Äîbringing coffee, joking about old times. Every time they said, ‚ÄúSorry about what happened, let‚Äôs fix things,‚Äù it sounded more like they were apologizing for a stubbed toe than years of neglect and betrayal.

Then they surprised me with dinner.

‚ÄúOur treat,‚Äù Jared said. ‚ÄúAt our old spot.‚Äù

Part of me wanted to delete the message and never look back. But another part of me‚Äîthe tired, devastated part‚Äîwondered if maybe, just maybe, we could end this all without bitterness. Without hating each other.

So I went. The restaurant hadn‚Äôt changed. Dim lighting, warm wooden booths, soft jazz playing overhead. It smelled like rosemary and nostalgia. I sat down, watching them laugh, trying to recapture something that had long since died. For a few moments, it almost felt okay.

Then Jared‚Äôs phone rang.

He glanced at it and froze. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Audrey.‚Äù

He answered, frowning. ‚ÄúWhat? Slow down‚Ä¶ You were robbed? What? Stabbed?! Where are you‚Äî‚Äù

In seconds, both he and Jackson were on their feet.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs crying,‚Äù Jared explained breathlessly. ‚ÄúShe was attacked. We‚Äôve got to go.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt say goodbye. They didn‚Äôt even look at me again.

They just ran. Ran like their world depended on her.

I sat there in silence, staring at the half-eaten food. The candle on the table flickered until it burned out completely.

I paid the bill myself.

When I stepped outside, the sky had opened up. Thunder cracked across the heavens as rain poured relentlessly. The streets were nearly empty‚Äîno taxis, no buses. The restaurant manager offered me an umbrella, but they were already closed. I couldn‚Äôt stay.

So I walked. Each step was heavy. My bandaged arms ached. My body screamed for rest. But the worst part?

The thunder. It echoed in my chest, triggering a deep fear I‚Äôd carried since childhood. I always froze during storms. The lightning, the cracks‚Äîit made me feel like the world was about to split in two.

I wrapped my coat tighter and kept going, the city turning into a blur of light and shadows.

Then‚Äîa sharp light. A horn.

A car.

I didn‚Äôt even have time to move.

Then: darkness.

When I woke up, everything felt‚Ä¶ soft. Too soft. I was in a room I didn‚Äôt recognize. Clean, white walls. Dim lighting. My body hurt, but it was dull, distant. I blinked hard, turning toward the sound of someone shifting nearby.

‚ÄúJared‚Ä¶?‚Äù I whispered.

But it wasn‚Äôt him.

A man sat in the corner, tall, dressed in black, his eyes unreadable. He didn‚Äôt move until I tried to sit up.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake,‚Äù he said. His voice was deep, steady. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move too much.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúRoscoe,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI found you after the accident. Took you to the hospital. You were unconscious.‚Äù

I wanted to ask more. But everything spun‚Äîand I blacked out again.

When I opened my eyes again, Roscoe was gone.

No note. No contact. Just‚Ä¶ gone. There were no missed calls. No messages. No check-ins.

Except for my mother.

Mom: Call me when you‚Äôre on your way here now. Everything‚Äôs ready now. Come home.

I didn‚Äôt tell her what happened. I didn‚Äôt want her to worry.

The nurse told me I‚Äôd been lucky. The car had hit me from the side, but nothing was broken‚Äîstill, I needed a few more days to heal.

So I stayed. Alone.

Until discharge.

Back at the apartment, I stepped inside just to grab the last of my things before I booked my flight home.

That‚Äôs when Jared appeared at the door.

‚ÄúOh, good. You‚Äôre back.‚Äù He smiled like nothing had happened. ‚ÄúSo, listen‚Ä¶ we had to sell your car. And some of your things too. Audrey needed emergency funds, and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, stunned. ‚ÄúYou sold my things?‚Äù

‚ÄúRelax,‚Äù Jackson said, walking in. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll pay you back. But Audrey‚Äôs been through a lot after the robbery. She needs someone to take care of her‚Äîcan you cook for her? She‚Äôs not eating well.‚Äù

I blinked, stunned. ‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù

Jackson‚Äôs brows furrowed. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôve you been anyway? Audrey said you went to some party after the dinner. Don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs not a good behavior when Audrey was in danger? You shouldn‚Äôt have been here with us! I think you‚Äôre being selfish.‚Äù

I felt like I‚Äôd been punched. I laughed. It came out hollow, broken. ‚ÄúRight. A party.‚Äù

Then I threw the hospital discharge file straight at them.

‚ÄúThere. That‚Äôs where I was. The hospital. You left me in the rain. I walked home through a thunderstorm. I got hit by a car.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶?‚Äù Jared asked, staring. ‚ÄúYou were in the hospital?‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you were with friends‚Ä¶‚Äù Jackson mumbled, confused. ‚ÄúAudrey said‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course she did,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always Audrey, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Before they could say more, a high-pitched scream came from the hallway.

‚ÄúHelp! Jared, Jackson‚Äîit hurts! Please!‚Äù

Audrey. Of course.

Always Audrey.

I didn‚Äôt wait to hear their response. I turned, stepped over the threshold, and walked away.

Chapter 4

My entire body still ached. So instead of leaving as planned, I stayed in my room, letting the dull pain anchor me to the bed.

I didn‚Äôt cry. There were no tears left.

When I opened my eyes again, sunlight streamed through the curtains, warm against my skin. And right there, at the foot of my bed, stood Jared and Jackson.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù Jared said with a sheepish smile, holding a tray. ‚ÄúWe brought you breakfast.‚Äù

Jackson placed the tray gently on my lap. Toast, scrambled eggs, some fruit, and a glass of orange juice. Bland and almost cold.

‚ÄúThought you could use something to start the day,‚Äù Jackson added, sitting at the edge of the bed.

I looked at them. They looked casual. Relaxed. Almost happy. Like the last few days hadn‚Äôt happened.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù Jared said, scratching the back of his neck. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry. Audrey told us she saw an Instagram story of you at a party that night‚Ä¶ and she was just hurt, you know? She got robbed and stabbed while thinking you were out dancing. She‚Ä¶ she thought you were ignoring her on purpose.‚Äù

Jackson chimed in. ‚ÄúShe really believed it. So‚Ä¶ maybe you should apologize to her. Just to clear things up.‚Äù

I stared at them in disbelief, then scoffed.

‚ÄúMaybe you should apologize to me.‚Äù

That made them blink.

Jared frowned. ‚ÄúWhy would we? It‚Äôs not like we did anything wrong. You didn‚Äôt tell us what happened. If you had, we could‚Äôve been there for you.‚Äù

I let out a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúDo I need to beg to be cared about now? I was gone for days. You didn‚Äôt even check.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that,‚Äù Jackson said firmly. ‚ÄúAudrey got stabbed. She needs us.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I didn‚Äôt?‚Äù My voice sharpened. ‚ÄúSo if I‚Äôm not bleeding in front of you, I don‚Äôt deserve a second thought?‚Äù

Before either of them could respond, the door creaked open and in she came.

Audrey. She wore a soft, oversized sweater and limped slightly. Her face was pale, lips trembling as tears welled up in her eyes.

‚ÄúAre you picking a fight with me now, Maureen?‚Äù she whispered, her voice shaking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. Okay? I didn‚Äôt mean to get hurt. I didn‚Äôt mean for any of this to happen.‚Äù

I watched her carefully. Her trembling, her pout, the subtle gaslighting laced in every word. Like she was the one being attacked.

Again. The tears slipped down her cheeks.

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want us to be enemies. We were sisters once‚Ä¶ I wish we could go back.‚Äù

And just like that, the boys snapped.

‚ÄúStop making her cry, Maureen,‚Äù Jared snapped.

‚ÄúCome on, Audrey,‚Äù Jackson said softly. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be walking too much. Let‚Äôs get you back to bed.‚Äù

They turned to her with such care, such concern‚Äîit stung.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll feed you,‚Äù Jared said as he took her hand. ‚ÄúYou need to eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Jackson added. ‚ÄúYou need your strength. We‚Äôll get your favorite seafood in the other room.‚Äù

Then they turned back to me.

‚ÄúYou eat what we made, Maureen,‚Äù Jared said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been discharged. Stop being so picky.‚Äù

And with that, they led Audrey out, leaving me alone again.

I looked down at the plate in front of me. The eggs were rubbery. The toast, dry. The fruit was unripe.

Across the hall, I could hear them laughing.

Audrey‚Äôs voice rang out clear: ‚ÄúMmm, I love crab legs! You remembered I hate toast, right? Seafood‚Äôs my favorite!‚Äù

Of course it was. They gave me scraps and fed her a feast.

I didn‚Äôt cry. Not this time. I was just done.

My phone buzzed.

It was a message from Mom: Venue options are in. Also attached are the dresses. Let me know what you like, darling.

I tapped the call icon.

‚ÄúMom,‚Äù I said, my voice steady.

‚ÄúMaureen! Did you get the pictures? What do you think of the flower arrangements?‚Äù she asked excitedly. ‚ÄúAnd also the dresses?‚Äù

‚ÄúI like everything. It was actually hard to choose,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll finalize it today. But I think I like the vintage one.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat! We‚Äôll prepare it for you. How long until you come back? Your groom‚Äôs waiting, you know. He‚Äôs very eager.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a few more days. Something happened, but I‚Äôll be there. I‚Äôm looking forward to wearing those dresses‚Ä¶ to the wedding.‚Äù

Mom let out a soft laugh. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my girl. We‚Äôll wait for you.‚Äù

I hung up. I stared at the tray, untouched. Then I felt it‚Äîthe silence shift.

I looked up. Jared and Jackson stood in the doorway. I hadn‚Äôt even heard them come back.

Their eyes locked on me, their faces unreadable.

Jackson‚Äôs voice came first. ‚ÄúDress to the wedding?‚Äù

Then Jared stepped forward, his brows pulling into a frown. ‚ÄúWedding? What wedding?‚Äù

I've been using my fellow ode 2 to grind my beans for my origami pour over, i do about 15g of coffee at a tick before the 5 grind setting. Lately, water just stops dripping near the end and kind of pools up and stops to a single slow drip. It never used to do that. Same beans i've been using for 2 years. I adjusted the grind size constantly to make it less fine, i'm now almost near the 6.5 grind setting which is a huge jump with no fix yet. I tried recalibrating and cleaning the ode (I confirmed in the recalibration that changing the grind size settings does infact work as the burrs touched each other, indication for me to to recalibrate at that zone as the tightest spot).  Any ideas? No real changes in variables in the last 2 years. Does the fellow ode v.2 just die after 2 years in terms of grind quality?",1,1755482036.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

I have a few friends I talk to online but I don't really see anyone non work related in person (and the work people are different clients every day).

I miss talking to people in person as I find talking to people helps me self regulate and feel human if that makes sense? My job is in communications and I find I struggle with it more when I don't talk to people because I start reverting to my nonverbal ritualistic comfort behaviours without friendly people around to chat to. I usually live with my family and see my partner most days so going weeks without IRL interactions means I'm feeling quite disconnected from the real world.

Does anyone have advice on finding people to talk to? In the past I've been on dating apps but that's more iffy now I have a partner as sometimes peoples intentions are non platonic even if you say you're just looking for a friend for an activity. Would it be strange to approach people in coffee shops if they are alone and ask if they would like company? I had an older lady approach me in a park while I was working on flow arts and I nearly talked her ear off, but just little interractions like this really help. I am that person who will try to talk to everyone... üòÖ

Anyone has the link to read this story for free?,"I peeled off my latex gloves with a satisfying snap and tossed them into the biohazard bin. Thirty-six hours on my feet, four cardiac arrests, one multi-car pileup, and a toddler who'd swallowed his mother's wedding ring. Just another marathon shift at San Francisco General.

""You're still standing. Impressive,"" Dr. Ramirez said, passing me in the hallway.

I managed a tired smile. ""Barely.""

But exhaustion couldn't touch the flutter of excitement in my chest. I pulled out my phone and texted Marcus:

\*Still on for City Hall at 2? Can't wait to make this official! ‚ù§Ô∏è\*

His response came quickly: \*Wouldn't miss it. See you soon, beautiful.\*

Five years together, and his messages still made me smile. I stared at the three dots that appeared, then disappeared without another text following. Probably just got distracted with work. Marcus was always juggling a dozen things at once‚Äîthe curse of being a tech entrepreneur in San Francisco.

I gathered my things from my locker, changing from scrubs into a simple navy dress I'd brought specially for our appointment. The marriage license was just paperwork, but it felt momentous‚Äîthe first official step toward becoming Dr. Natalie Sterling.

""There's the blushing bride!"" Sarah's voice rang out as I entered the staff lounge. My best friend and fellow ER physician was pouring herself coffee, dark circles under her eyes matching mine.

""Not a bride yet,"" I corrected, but couldn't help the smile spreading across my face.

""Let me see that rock again,"" Sarah demanded, grabbing my left hand. The emerald-cut diamond caught the fluorescent light. ""God, Marcus has good taste. One month to go, huh?""

""Twenty-nine days,"" I corrected, accepting the coffee she offered. ""But who's counting?""

""Everyone is,"" Dr. Chen, a passing nurse chimed in with a wink. ""Hospital's favorite love story. The doctor who healed the broken bad boy.""

I rolled my eyes but couldn't suppress my smile. It wasn't far from the truth. Marcus had come into my ER five years ago after a motorcycle accident‚Äîreckless driving after a brutal breakup, I'd later learn. I'd put twelve stitches in his forehead while he'd flirted through his concussion. Three days later, flowers arrived at the nurses' station with a note asking me to dinner.

""I still can't believe you're marrying a guy who crashed his bike because his girlfriend dumped him,"" Sarah teased.

""Ex-girlfriend,"" I corrected. ""Ancient history.""

Sarah raised an eyebrow. ""Victoria Hayes, right? Wasn't she some marketing executive or something?""

""Something like that,"" I murmured, the name sending an inexplicable chill through me. Marcus rarely spoke about Victoria, but when he did, there was always something in his voice‚Äîa tension that made me change the subject.

""Well, he traded up,"" Sarah declared, squeezing my shoulder. ""You saved his life, Nat. Literally and figuratively.""

I checked my watch. ""I should get going. Don't want to be late.""

The hospital lobby was crowded with the usual afternoon chaos‚Äîvisitors, discharged patients, staff changing shifts. I was halfway across when I spotted him through the glass doors. Marcus, in his tailored navy suit that matched my dress perfectly without planning. My heart did that familiar little skip.

I raised my hand to wave, then froze.

He wasn't alone.

A woman stood before him, her back to me. Tall, slender, with glossy dark hair cascading down her back. Her hand rested on his forearm with casual intimacy. Something about her posture‚Äîconfident, possessive‚Äîmade me instinctively step behind a structural column.

""One month, Marcus,"" her voice carried across the lobby. Rich, slightly husky. ""One month before you're chained to Dr. Boring for life.""

I should have revealed myself then. Should have walked up, introduced myself, laughed it off. Instead, I stayed hidden, heart hammering against my ribs.

""Victoria..."" Marcus's voice held a warning, but also something else. Something that made my stomach twist.

""A countdown romance,"" she continued, stepping closer to him. ""Thirty days to remember what we had. What we could still have.""

I waited for him to step back. To laugh. To tell her he was happy now.

Instead, after a pause that stretched like an eternity, he whispered:

""Okay.""

I stood frozen behind the column, my fingers digging into the cool marble as Marcus's single word shattered my world.

""Okay.""

Just like that. Five years together, a month before our wedding, and he'd agreed to a countdown romance with his ex. My medical training kicked in‚Äîdetach, observe, diagnose. My pulse pounded in my ears as Victoria's perfume lingered in the air long after she'd sauntered away, leaving Marcus staring after her.

I waited until he'd left before emerging from my hiding place. My legs carried me mechanically to the parking garage. I sat in my car, hands gripping the steering wheel, but couldn't bring myself to start the engine. The marriage license appointment came and went.

Three hours later, my phone buzzed with his text: \*Got held up in an emergency meeting. Can we reschedule City Hall for tomorrow?\*

I stared at the message, my thumb hovering over the screen. The first lie. How many more would follow?

\*Sure\*, I replied. \*Hope everything's okay.\*

That night, I prepared dinner as usual‚Äîroasted salmon with asparagus, his favorite. I watched him across our kitchen island, searching for signs of the betrayal I'd witnessed. He looked the same‚Äîhis dark hair slightly disheveled, the scar above his eyebrow from the accident that brought us together. But something had shifted beneath the surface, like tectonic plates before an earthquake.

""How was your day?"" I asked, my voice surprisingly steady.

""Crazy busy. The investors are getting nervous about the launch."" He took a sip of wine, not quite meeting my eyes.

I nodded, letting the lie settle between us like a third presence at our table.

We were washing dishes when his phone rang. He glanced at the screen, and something flickered across his face‚Äîexcitement poorly disguised as annoyance.

""I need to take this,"" he said, stepping onto our balcony and sliding the door closed.

I couldn't hear his words through the glass, but I saw his expression soften, saw the smile he usually reserved for me. Just before he ended the call, the balcony door cracked open, and a woman's voice drifted through.

""Can't wait.""

Two simple words that confirmed everything.

When he came back inside, I was drying the same plate I'd been holding when he left.

""Who was that?"" I asked, placing the plate carefully in the cabinet.

""Just Dave from development,"" he said, reaching for his wine glass. ""Server issues.""

I nodded again, adding another lie to the growing collection.

The week that followed was an exercise in restraint. I watched him craft excuses with increasing confidence‚Äîlate meetings, business dinners, a sudden trip to Los Angeles that couldn't be postponed. Each lie was a small betrayal, each one easier than the last.

On Friday, I made reservations at Acquerello, the restaurant where we'd celebrated our first anniversary. I spent my lunch break shopping for a new dress, something that made me feel beautiful and confident. Something to remind him of what he was risking.

At 6:30, I was applying lipstick when my phone chimed.

\*I'm so sorry, Nat. Urgent pitch meeting just came up. Can't get out of it. Don't wait up.\*

I stared at my reflection, at the woman in the emerald dress that matched her engagement ring. The woman who was being systematically erased from her own life.

I spent the evening alone in our apartment, surrounded by framed photos of our happiness‚ÄîMarcus and me hiking in Yosemite, laughing on the Golden Gate Bridge, dancing at his company's holiday party. Had any of it been real? Or was I always just a placeholder, keeping his bed warm until Victoria returned?

At 2 AM, my phone vibrated on the nightstand. Marcus still wasn't home. I reached for it, expecting another excuse.

Instead, it was a text from an unknown number. No words, just an image.

Marcus and Victoria, heads bent close together over wine glasses at a candlelit table I recognized from the exclusive Auberge du Soleil in Napa Valley. His hand covered hers on the table. Her other hand was raised slightly, as if caught mid-gesture‚Äîa vintage ruby ring glinting on her finger. The same ring I'd once found in Marcus's drawer, which he'd explained away as a family heirloom he'd forgotten to return.

Their faces were illuminated by candlelight, caught in a moment of shared laughter‚Äîintimate, exclusive, cruel.

I zoomed in on the timestamp in the corner of the photo: 7:43 PM. During his ""urgent pitch meeting.""

The phone slipped from my fingers as the truth crashed over me in waves. The countdown had begun.

1mt8wqn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mt8wqn,This One-Page Diagram Unlocks Your Business's Entire Growth Formula.,"# Driver Tree Modeling: Your Business on One Page

As a small business owner, you wear a dozen hats. You're the CEO, the head of sales, the marketing guru, the customer service lead, and sometimes, the janitor. You're constantly juggling a thousand different tasks and trying to make sense of a mountain of information. Spreadsheets blur together, reports pile up, and you're left with a nagging question: *What are the few things that truly matter? What levers can I actually pull to grow my business?*

It‚Äôs a feeling of being overwhelmed by complexity. You know your business inside and out, but connecting the daily grind‚Äîthe marketing campaigns, the sales calls, the operational tweaks‚Äîto the big picture numbers like revenue and profit can feel like trying to solve a puzzle in the dark.

What if you could change that? What if you could step back and see your entire business, from the smallest daily action to the highest financial goal, laid out on a single page? What if you could see, with absolute visual clarity, how every part of your operation connects and what truly *drives* your success?

This isn't a fantasy. It's the power of a **driver tree**. It‚Äôs a simple yet profound tool used by the best financial planning and analysis (FP&A) professionals to distill complexity into a clear, actionable roadmap. And it‚Äôs not just for Fortune 500 companies. It‚Äôs the secret weapon you need to gain control, make smarter decisions, and unlock predictable growth.

# What in the World is a Driver Tree?

Let's demystify the jargon. A **driver tree** is a visual diagram that breaks down your company's key outcomes (like profit) into the specific, controllable factors that influence them. Think of it like a family tree for your business's performance. At the very top, you have your main financial goal‚Äîsay, Net Profit. Then, you branch down, layer by layer, asking the question, ""What drives this?""

* What drives **Net Profit**? Well, that‚Äôs **Revenue** minus **Costs**.
* Okay, what drives **Revenue**? For a coffee shop, it might be the **Number of Customers** multiplied by the **Average Spend per Customer**.
* And what drives the **Number of Customers**? That could be a combination of **Foot Traffic**, your **Website Traffic**, and the **Conversion Rate** from your latest social media ad campaign.

Suddenly, you're not just looking at a single, intimidating number like ""profit."" You're looking at a logical, interconnected map of your business. You can see precisely how the number of people walking past your shop and the effectiveness of your Instagram ad directly connect to your bottom line.

This isn't just a reporting tool; it's a dynamic model of your business. It transforms static financial statements into a living, breathing representation of how your business actually works.

# Why Every Small Business Needs One

Big corporations have entire **FP&A** departments dedicated to this kind of analysis. As a small business owner, you have something even better: agility. A driver tree gives you the clarity to use that agility to your advantage.

**1. It Creates Focus and Alignment:** When your business is on one page, everyone on your team can see it. Your marketing person understands how their campaigns affect customer numbers, which in turn drives revenue. Your barista sees how upselling a pastry (increasing average spend) directly contributes to profit. It gets everyone rowing in the same direction because they can see how their work fits into the bigger picture.

**2. It Makes Forecasting a Breeze:** One of the biggest challenges for small businesses is accurate **forecasting**. A driver tree turns this from a guessing game into a logical exercise. Instead of just pulling a revenue goal out of thin air (""Let's grow 20% next year!""), you can model *how* you'll get there.

* ""To grow revenue by 20%, we need to increase our customer base by 10% and our average spend by 10%.""
* ""To increase our customer base by 10%, we need to increase our website conversion rate from 2% to 2.5% and generate 500 more leads per month.""

Now you have a concrete plan. Your **forecasting** is based on tangible, operational goals, not just wishful thinking.

**3. It Enables Smarter, Faster Decisions (Scenario Planning):** This is where the magic happens. Once you have your driver tree, you can play ""what if.""

* *What if we increase our marketing budget by $1,000?* How many more leads would that generate? What would that do to our customer numbers and, ultimately, our profit?
* *What if we raise our prices by 5%?* We might lose a few customers, but the increase in average spend might more than make up for it. Let's model it.
* *What if our supplier increases the cost of coffee beans?* We can instantly see how that impacts our Cost of Goods Sold and what we need to do‚Äîeither increase prices or sell more‚Äîto protect our profit margin.

You can test strategies on paper before you risk real time and money, giving you an incredible competitive advantage.

# Building Your First Driver Tree: A Step-by-Step Guide

This might sound complex, but the process is surprisingly intuitive. All you need is a whiteboard (or a large sheet of paper) and a willingness to think critically about your business.

**Step 1: Start at the Top (Your North Star Metric)**

What is the single most important financial outcome for your business right now? For most, it's **Net Profit**. But it could also be **Revenue Growth** or **Cash Flow**. Whatever it is, write it at the very top of your board. This is your ""Level 1"" metric.

**Step 2: Deconstruct Your Top Metric**

Now, break that metric down into its most direct components. This is your ""Level 2."" The classic breakdown for Net Profit is:

* **Net Profit = Revenue - Costs**

Draw branches from Net Profit to these two new boxes.

**Step 3: Keep Asking ""What Drives This?""**

Now, take each of your Level 2 metrics and break them down further.

**Deconstructing Revenue:** How does your business make money? Be specific.

* For an e-commerce store: **Revenue = Website Visitors x Conversion Rate x Average Order Value (AOV)**
* For a subscription business: **Revenue = Number of Subscribers x Monthly Subscription Price**
* For a service business: **Revenue = Number of Clients x Average Project Fee**

**Deconstructing Costs:** Break your costs into logical categories.

* **Total Costs = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) + Operating Expenses (OpEx)**
* Then break down OpEx: **OpEx = Marketing Spend + Salaries + Rent + Software Subscriptions**

You are now building ""Level 3"" of your tree.

**Step 4: Move from Financial to Operational Drivers**

This is the most critical step. Keep breaking down the components until you get to the actual, day-to-day activities you can control. These are your operational drivers.

Let's go back to the e-commerce example:

* What drives **Website Visitors**? This could be **Paid Traffic** (from ads), **Organic Traffic** (from SEO), **Email Marketing Traffic**, and **Social Media Traffic**.
* What drives **Conversion Rate**? This could be **Website Speed**, **Product Page Quality**, and the **Effectiveness of your Checkout Process**.
* What drives **Average Order Value**? This could be **Product Pricing**, **Upsell/Cross-sell Offers**, and **Free Shipping Thresholds**.

By the time you're done, you'll have a detailed map that connects your Google Ads budget all the way up to your net profit.

**Best Practices for Building Your Tree:**

* **Involve Your Team:** You don't know everything. Your marketing lead knows what drives traffic. Your operations manager knows what drives costs. Building the tree together creates shared ownership and uncovers insights you'd miss on your own.
* **Use a ""Verb-Noun"" Structure for Operational Drivers:** Frame your drivers as actions. Instead of ""Website,"" use ""Increase Website Traffic."" Instead of ""Ads,"" use ""Improve Ad Click-Through Rate."" This makes the tree inherently actionable.
* **Focus on What You Can Control:** It's tempting to include external factors like ""the economy,"" but that's not a lever you can pull. Stick to drivers that you and your team can directly influence.
* **Don't Strive for Perfection on Day One:** Your first driver tree won't be perfect. It's a living document. Start with what you know, and as you gather more data and understand your business better, you can refine it.

# Putting Your Driver Tree to Work

Building the tree is just the beginning. Its real value comes from how you use it.

**1. Create a Dashboard:** Identify the 5-7 most important operational drivers at the bottom of your tree‚Äîthe ones with the biggest impact. These are your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Track them relentlessly. Build a simple dashboard that you review weekly. This ensures you're focusing on the activities that truly move the needle.

**2. Integrate it into Your Planning and Forecasting:** When you set your goals for the next quarter, use the driver tree. Don't just set a revenue target; set targets for the operational drivers that will get you there. This makes your financial **forecasting** process robust and credible.

**3. Tell a Story with Your Numbers:** The next time you talk to your team, your business partner, or a potential investor, don't just show them a profit and loss statement. Show them your driver tree. Walk them through the logic of your business. Explain *why* the numbers are what they are and what levers you're pulling to change them. It‚Äôs a powerful way to build confidence and demonstrate that you have a deep, strategic understanding of your business.

# A Final Word: From Complexity to Clarity

Running a small business will always be challenging. There will always be unexpected problems and new opportunities. But you don't have to be lost in the complexity.

The driver tree model is more than just a financial tool; it's a way of thinking. It forces you to be disciplined, to connect the dots, and to focus on what truly matters. It takes all the chaotic, swirling information about your business and organizes it onto a single page, providing you with the visual clarity you need to lead with confidence.

So grab a whiteboard. Gather your team. Start asking, ""What drives this?"" The answers will build you a map‚Äîa map that will guide you from where you are today to wherever you want to go.

1mt8wps,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovementday/comments/1mt8wps/the_invention_of_video_games/,The Invention of Video Games,"Close your eyes and imagine this.¬†It is 1966, and a German-American engineer named Ralph Baer is hunched over a brown wooden box with wires dangling out like the guts of a robot.¬†His lab smells like solder smoke and stale coffee.¬†On the TV screen in front of him, two white squares blink, paddle-like, moving side to side.¬†A dot bounces between them. This was Pong, before ""Pong"" even had a name.¬†History was being made in a room that was so dull, it could double as a DMV waiting line.¬†This was the birth of the home video game console.¬†The Magnavox Odyssey, a box that looked like a toaster married a typewriter, but inside it was the seed of every gaming empire.¬†The PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series X, even Mario jumping for gold coins.¬†All of it traced back to that clunky brown box.¬†And here is the kick in the nuts.¬†Ralph Baer sold the rights to that world-changing invention for one hundred thousand dollars.

Now let‚Äôs hit pause and put that in perspective.¬†In 1972, one hundred grand was good money.¬†Enough to buy a Cadillac, a suburban house, and maybe a backyard pool with a diving board your drunk uncle would absolutely break his leg on.¬†But compare that to the industry today, and it is laughable.¬†Video gaming is now worth over two hundred billion dollars globally.¬†That is billion with a ‚ÄúB.‚Äù Bigger than Hollywood.¬†Bigger than the NFL, NBA, and MLB combined.¬†Ralph Baer‚Äôs little brown box lit the fuse for an explosion, and he walked away with a six-figure check that, in hindsight, looks like he traded the rights to Hogwarts for gas money.

But before you label him a sucker, understand this.¬†Ralph Baer was not just some nerd with a screwdriver.¬†He was a visionary. The son of German Jews who escaped Nazi Germany in 1938.¬†He served in the U.S. Army during World War 2.¬†This was not just a tinkerer.¬†This was a man who knew survival, grit, and reinvention.¬†His console was born in a time when TVs had rabbit-ear antennas, channels went off the air at midnight, and if you wanted entertainment at home, you were playing Monopoly or working on a puzzle.¬†He gave people a way to turn the TV from a passive box into an interactive playground.¬†And he did it at a time when the idea sounded so crazy that people asked, ‚ÄúWhy would anyone want to play games on a television?‚Äù Fast forward to today,¬†and people are streaming Fortnite for millions of followers, getting filthy rich, all while their mom yells at them to take out the trash.

Oh, How times have changed. Ralph Baer‚Äôs story is about financial independence and knowing the worth of your vision.¬†He did not lose because he lacked genius.¬†He lost because he undervalued his creation in a world that could not yet see its potential.¬†That is what many of us do with our own lives.¬†We sell our time, our bodies, and our dreams for cheap because we want quick comfort.¬†A paycheck instead of ownership.¬†A slice instead of the whole pie.¬†Think about it. How many people slave away at jobs they hate because they never stop to consider that their ideas, their talents, their little ‚Äúbrown boxes,‚Äù might be worth more than they imagine?

Fun fact. The word ‚Äúconsole‚Äù originally meant a support bracket for a shelf or a piece of furniture.¬†It literally comes from the Latin ‚Äúconsolari,‚Äù to comfort or support.¬†Ralph Baer did exactly that. He built a support system for fun.¬†A platform for play. A console that would one day comfort billions of people through joy, distraction, and community.¬†And yet, he cashed out like he was pawning a guitar before the band got famous.¬†The industry comforted everyone else while leaving him with only a small slice of its fortune.

So what do we do with this knowledge?¬†We do not let our ideas get stolen cheap.¬†We guard them, develop them, and stand firm when someone tries to buy us out too early.¬†And this isn‚Äôt just about money.¬†It‚Äôs about your health, your relationships, and your independence.¬†If you treat your body like Baer treated his console, cashing it out for short-term comfort, you will regret it.¬†Eating junk, skipping the gym, ignoring your sleep, all for the short-term dopamine, is the equivalent of trading the rights to PlayStation for a pack of Twinkies.¬†The game of life is long, and the real jackpot comes to those who invest and protect their assets.

Here‚Äôs another fun fact for you.¬†Magnavox, the company that bought Baer‚Äôs invention, was not exactly noble either.¬†They milked his design, then sued Atari and every competitor they could find, claiming the rights to the idea.¬†Big corporations circling like vultures, fighting over scraps, while Baer watched from the sidelines.¬†And that is why you cannot blindly trust institutions, whether it‚Äôs government, religion, or corporate giants.¬†They will always look out for themselves before you.¬†Skepticism isn‚Äôt bitterness, it is survival.¬†Just ask Ralph Baer, who literally invented the fun and got cut out of the party.So here‚Äôs something to think about.¬†You have your own ‚Äúconsole‚Äù inside you.¬†A raw idea, a hidden skill, a talent you keep brushing off as nothing special.¬†But if you protect it, nurture it, and refuse to sell it for cheap validation, it could be your ticket to freedom.¬†Do not let fear, debt, or impatience rob you of the fortune your ideas could create.¬†Ralph Baer changed the world but walked away with pennies compared to his impact.¬†You don‚Äôt have to make the same mistake.

Guard your ideas. Protect your body.¬†Invest in your soul. And never, ever trade away your potential for short-term relief.¬†Because the world will gladly cash you out cheap if you let it.

1mt8uy5,https://i.redd.it/344nx1oqmojf1.png,One Night Stand With My Ex‚Äôs Billionaire Enemy? Where can I get the free reading link for this story?,"CracksÔºÅ

My fianc√© hit me.

Three minutes ago, I had been daydreaming about how to decorate our ridiculously expensive penthouse apartment, where every corner looked like it belonged on the cover of a magazine.

Two minutes ago, I accidentally broke a mug.

Then, Rhys slapped me across the face‚Äîhard.

My cheek burned like it had been seared by fire. It took a full thirty seconds before my brain restarted, slowly piecing reality back together.

‚ÄúAre you fucking insane?‚Äù I gritted my teeth, forcing the words through the cracks of my jaw.

Rhys‚Äôs lips were pressed into a cold, tight line, his expression dark and resolute. ‚ÄúIt was just a mug with Katherine‚Äôs face on it,‚Äù he said, like my reaction was an overblown performance, not the result of something horrifying he had just done.

‚ÄúYou have got to be fucking kidding me.‚Äù I stared at him in disbelief, chest heaving as rage and humiliation churned violently inside me, ready to explode.

For half a second‚Äîjust half‚Äîsomething like guilt flickered across his face. Then it vanished, consumed by a storm of fury.

‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre the insane one!‚Äù he roared. ‚ÄúI already agreed to marry you‚Äîwhat more do you want? Katherine‚Äôs gone, but you still broke that mug on purpose!‚Äù

His voice trembled with anger. ‚ÄúShe was your sister! She had to leave because of you! And now you're jealous of her? You won‚Äôt rest until every trace of her is erased, will you?‚Äù

The hatred in his eyes cut deeper than the slap.

My cheek throbbed. My hand was still bleeding. But nothing hurt more than my heart.

I forced myself to unclench my jaw and made one last attempt to explain. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me. I never asked her to leave.‚Äù

Technically speaking, I understood why someone might say that. Katherine had left behind a letter. In it, she said she‚Äôd seen my diary, realized I had a crush on Rhys, and decided to ‚Äúlet go,‚Äù to ‚Äúlet him be yours.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think she ever understood that a diary meant privacy. I never meant for anyone to read it, but not only did she read it‚Äîshe told everyone.

No one cared about the pain I felt when my secret was exposed. I was dragged out, nailed to a pillar of shame, forced to pay for her so-called noble sacrifice.

To my family, it was like I‚Äôd been bumped up to the starting lineup out of nowhere, replacing the golden girl‚ÄîI should‚Äôve been grateful. Even if Rhys had stabbed me in the gut, they‚Äôd still find a way to excuse it.

It was as if my parents had always hated me. No matter how much better I did than Katherine, they always saw me as bitter, as someone who couldn‚Äôt protect her fragile pride.

The searing pain on my cheek intensified.

My fingers clenched tightly around the engagement ring. A wave of heat‚Äîanger, humiliation, resentment‚Äîrose in my throat.

Hot tears welled in my eyes, blurring my vision. I blinked fast, wiping them away before they could fall.

I would not cry. I would never show weakness in front of him.

I took a heavy step toward the door, struggling to move. I had to get out of there, or I would completely fall apart. Whatever shred of dignity I had left‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt let it be destroyed in front of this man.

Rhys suddenly grabbed my wrist and yanked me back. ‚ÄúClean it up.‚Äù

I looked up at him in disbelief, needing to confirm I‚Äôd heard him right.

‚ÄúYou broke the mug. You clean up the pieces.‚Äù His voice was icy, absolute.

He had to be insane.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I lifted my chin and spat the word without an ounce of compromise.

His face tightened, jaw clenched. ‚ÄúYou sure you want to do this?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I said no.‚Äù My eyes were red, but they blazed with defiance as I stared him down without flinching.

If love meant I had to grind my self-respect into the dirt, then it was worthless to me.

The air between us was taut enough to snap. I could almost hear it crackling. The fury in his eyes was an uncontrollable blaze, threatening to consume me. And beneath that fire, I saw something else‚Äîdisbelief. The once-docile little lamb had bared her fangs.

He took a step closer, menace radiating from him. ‚ÄúLast chance. If you don‚Äôt obey me, then we‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äîare over,‚Äù I finished for him, cold and final.

Shock froze his face. For a moment, the air went still. He hadn‚Äôt expected me to actually say it.

While he was caught in that moment of confusion, I wrenched my arm free from his grip. The taste of freedom hadn‚Äôt yet bloomed in my chest when he snapped back to life, grabbing my arm again with brutal force.

Now.

I spun around without hesitation and raised my hand‚ÄîSmack! A resounding slap landed hard across Rhys‚Äôs handsome, arrogant face.

The air froze again, thick with silence.

My palm tingled slightly, but it brought a rush of fierce, unprecedented satisfaction.

Rhys staggered back a few steps, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief‚Äînot from the pain, but from a world turned upside down. He never thought I would dare. After all, I had once loved him so deeply.

I lowered my hand, lifted my chin, and looked calmly at his stunned expression. I gave him a faint smile. ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre even.‚Äù

Without waiting another moment, I dragged my feet away from that suffocating hell.

If I stayed even one more second, I would break down. I‚Äôd rather choke on my own tears than let him see them fall.

Then‚Äîthud‚ÄîI fell.

High heels and emotional chaos are a terrible match.

Pain shot through my palms and knees as they scraped against the hard marble. Blood surged out instantly, but I barely felt it.

I got up, grabbed my purse, and kept walking.

Home. I just wanted to go home. Away from all of this. Away from him.

Like a woman fleeing the scene of a crime, I burst out of the building‚Äîonly to slam into a wall of muscle and the intoxicating scent of expensive cologne.

I looked up‚Äîand saw sharp, sculpted features with an aura so commanding it could silence a room. He looked like the kind of man who, if you pissed him off, wouldn‚Äôt just ruin your life‚Äîhe‚Äôd erase your entire existence.

Unfortunately, that only made him more attractive.

For a second, I wished he would throw me over his shoulder and carry me to his lair‚Äîmy face flushed red instantly. If this were a porno, the camera angle would be an absolute disaster.

I snapped myself back to reality.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I mumbled and rushed into the elevator of my apartment building.

Back upstairs, I rummaged through my bag. My heart sank.

No keys.

Of course. The universe had clearly declared today The End of Mira Day.

Frustration and helplessness surged in my chest. I kicked off my heels and shook the doorknob violently. It didn‚Äôt help‚Äîbut I needed to let it out. Why did everyone always choose Katherine?! Hadn‚Äôt I done enough?

I collapsed against the wall, sliding down to the cold floor as sobs tore from my throat. The tears came in a flood, impossible to stop.

Just as I was nearly choking on my own cries, a voice‚Äîlow, smooth, like black velvet‚Äîcut through the air behind me.

‚ÄúYour key.‚Äù

Fury sparked in my veins. Why did someone always interrupt me just when I was about to get it all out?

Annoyed, I turned, ready to glare‚Äîonly to freeze.

Through tear-blurred eyes, I saw him again. The man I had bumped into downstairs‚Äîthe one who looked like he had stepped out of a Renaissance painting.

‚ÄúYour key fell,‚Äù he said, raising an eyebrow as his gaze landed on the scattered contents of my purse. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably why you couldn‚Äôt find it.‚Äù

I stared at the key resting in his elegant hand, my face flushing so hot it could‚Äôve lit a match. I snatched it from him and fumbled to unlock the door, stumbling inside without a word.

It wasn‚Äôt until my back hit the door that I realized‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt even thanked him.

Great job, Mira. You absolute idiot.

Hesitating, I crept toward the peephole. Through that tiny lens, I saw him calmly turn, unlock the door directly across the hall, and stroll inside.

He lived across from me?

He must‚Äôve just moved in. With a face like that‚Äîand that aura‚Äîthere‚Äôs no way I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed before.

Wait, Mira. What are you doing? You‚Äôre seriously letting a hot new neighbor make you forget the hell Rhys just put you through?

No. Absolutely not. All men are trash. Always.

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to steady my racing heartbeat, reminding myself not to be so stupid again. But no matter how hard I tried, that sculpted face kept flashing through my mind.

I needed ice‚Äîfor my racing pulse, and more urgently, for the stinging pain on my cheek.

Just as I forced myself up to head to the kitchen, my phone rang, shrill and sharp.

One glance at the screen made my whole body go cold.

Mom.

I couldn‚Äôt ignore the call. If I did, she would destroy my career without hesitation. She was absolutely capable of it.

The moment I picked up, her voice sliced through the air‚Äîcold and merciless.

‚ÄúMira, you must be insane! How dare you do something so disgraceful to Rhys! You apologize to him right now or you‚Äôre no longer our daughter!‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain, stunned‚Äîbut she hung up before I could get a single word out.

I gripped my phone tightly. Why was it that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn‚Äôt earn even a sliver of their love? And Katherine‚Äîshe never had to do anything, yet she was their perfect, precious jewel.

Enough.

I thought if I worked hard enough, my family, my fianc√©‚Äîthey would love me.

But that‚Äôs never going to happen.

I have to reclaim the self-respect I lost long ago.

I have to break off this engagement with Rhys‚Äîno matter the consequences.

...

For the next forty-eight hours, I became one with my bed.

No calls. No outside world. Just me, a pile of blankets, and the crushing weight of humiliation.

That slap from Rhys wasn‚Äôt just a blow to the face. In so many ways, it was a slap across my entire life‚Äîone steeped in desperation, delusion, and pathetic longing. It forced me awake. It forced me to look back on everything I‚Äôd ever done to make him notice me, everything I did for a fantasy called ‚Äúus‚Äù that had never truly existed.

God, where do I even begin?

Like the time he casually mentioned he liked girls with smooth, silky hair. That night, I ordered three bottles of the shampoo he‚Äôd once praised. My scalp broke out in hives. I smiled through the pain and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine‚Äîsome allergic reactions are worth it.‚Äù

Or when he told me he was too busy with work to grab dinner, so I stayed up learning how to bake and brought him a box of pastries in the rain. He didn‚Äôt even open the door‚Äîjust had the receptionist tell me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother next time. I don‚Äôt like sweets.‚Äù

Then there was that night at his friend‚Äôs dinner party. I forced down oysters‚Äîmy most hated food‚Äîjust to seem ‚Äúgraceful and agreeable.‚Äù I spent the entire night crouched over a toilet, writhing in pain until 3 a.m. He didn‚Äôt ask if I was okay. He laughed and said, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt even handle seafood? That‚Äôs just dramatic.‚Äù

But the worst?

That time he quoted a line from The Godfather he liked. I stayed up all night reading film essays just to casually drop the quote at a party. I got it wrong. He corrected me in front of everyone, sneering, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pretend to like things you clearly don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

And I laughed. I laughed and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got such a good memory.‚Äù

What a joke. I never realized I was never the person he wanted.

He never really saw me. To him, I was nothing more than a low-rent version of the ‚Äúperfect and untouchable‚Äù Katherine. A cheap stand-in.

I wasn‚Äôt her, but I could offer him the faint illusion of having her again. That was all I was good for.

I buried my face in the pillow and laughed until I shook. Not because it was funny‚Äîbut because the pain had gone too deep for tears.

Thankfully, after my parents delivered their final ultimatum two days ago, they hadn‚Äôt contacted me again.

A small part of me wondered‚Äîdid Rhys intervene? Did he finally realize what he‚Äôd done?

Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

And it didn‚Äôt stop ringing.

For a full five minutes.

I groaned into my pillow. Oh god. Social interaction.

Dragging my exhausted body to the door, I opened it.

Ivan Carlisle‚Äîmy best friend and the only person who had the legal right to yell at me‚Äîstood on the other side, hands on hips. Then her eyes landed on my face.

Her expression froze. The light in her eyes dimmed. ‚ÄúWhat the hell happened to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I said, trying to sound casual. She wasn‚Äôt buying it.

She reached out, gently tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. Her jaw clenched.

Then‚Äîsilence.

Not the awkward kind. The dangerous kind. The kind that comes right before something explodes.

‚ÄúWho hit you?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome inside,‚Äù I muttered quickly, trying not to draw the neighbors‚Äô attention. That would be mortifying.

Ivan didn‚Äôt move. She gripped my arm and spoke through gritted teeth. ‚ÄúMira. Who. Hit. You?‚Äù

As soon as the door clicked shut, I collapsed into her arms. My face buried in her sweater, and within seconds, the fabric was soaked.

She didn‚Äôt flinch. She just held me, her hand moving in calm, soothing circles across my back.

I didn‚Äôt know how long I cried. Long enough for my throat to burn and my nose to turn bright red like Rudolph. Eventually, I managed to force out a single word.

‚ÄúRhys.‚Äù

Ivan didn‚Äôt move.

Everyone in Sky City knew that name. Rhys Granger wasn‚Äôt the kind of man who needed to throw punches to destroy someone. One phone call to the right person, and your life would be over. Reputation, money, status‚Äîhe had it all.

Every move he made was deliberate, timed to perfection‚Äîlike the ticking of a Rolex. When he chose to go to war, he was a nobleman wielding cruelty like fine art, probably with a glass of aged Scotch in hand.

People called him arrogant. No one ever called him violent.

That‚Äôs why, when Ivan processed what I‚Äôd just said, I could practically hear the gears in her brain screaming in protest.

‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù she muttered under her breath, as if denying it out loud might somehow make it untrue. ‚ÄúRhys? Your Rhys? He couldn‚Äôt have‚Ä¶‚Äù

I got it. I really did. Rhys was supposed to be the gentleman. The golden boy. The flawless, elegant, untouchable good guy.

‚ÄúIt was him,‚Äù I said quietly.

She exhaled sharply, then started rubbing my back again, this time slower. ‚ÄúTell me what happened.‚Äù

I swallowed. ‚ÄúI was at his place. I, uh‚Ä¶ accidentally broke a mug.‚Äù

Her entire body tensed. ‚ÄúJust a mug?‚Äù

I nodded.

Silence. Then she clenched her jaw and said, ‚ÄúI swear to God, if you tell me it was some priceless, hand-crafted, one-of-a-kind family heirloom‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was Katherine‚Äôs mug.‚Äù

Ivan‚Äôs hand froze mid-pat.

Everything shifted. One second, she was my concerned best friend. The next, she was a woman plotting murder.

I grabbed her wrist before she could get ahold of something worse. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over between Rhys and me.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúReally. Even if the earth split in two and Sky City sank into the ocean, I wouldn‚Äôt marry him.‚Äù

That stopped her from storming out to commit homicide.

‚ÄúKatherine. That venomous snake‚Äî‚Äù Ivan spat the name like it physically hurt her. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not even here anymore and she‚Äôs still managing to wreck your life! And your parents? They just stand there watching! I swear, they could watch her light your house on fire and they‚Äôd hand her the matches. It‚Äôs unbelievable!‚Äù

I felt like a balloon someone had just popped‚Äîdeflated, exhausted. That all-too-familiar ache settled deep in my chest. I knew some parents would always love their firstborn more. And there was nothing I could do about it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Mira.‚Äù

Ivan sat down beside me and gave my head a firm push toward her shoulder. I pulled away and managed a weak smile. ‚ÄúActually, I think it‚Äôs a good thing. At least I found out what kind of man he is before we got married. Better now than after the vows, right?‚Äù

She let out a long sigh, her eyes softening. ‚ÄúMira, you know no matter what happens, I‚Äôve got your back.‚Äù

Right then, my stomach growled loud enough to interrupt the moment. Loudly.

Like a magician, Ivan reached behind her and pulled out a takeout bag, giving me a look that practically screamed: I knew you‚Äôd be like this.

I wanted to hug her, but I was too busy eating like a ravenous little goblin.

After dinner, she pushed me into the bedroom and went off to clean up. I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling, drained and overwhelmed. What now?

Through the half-open door, I heard her on the phone. I didn‚Äôt catch every word, but the ones I did hear‚Ä¶ were iconic.

‚ÄúA pile of shit.‚Äù

‚ÄúTotal fucking psycho.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, you think that‚Äôs bad? Wait till I tell you what this violent bastard actually did‚Äî‚Äù

She was probably talking to Zane Hasterton. And unlike Rhys, Zane would never raise a hand to her.

The way Ivan so instantly, so fiercely chose me‚Äîwithout hesitation, without question‚Äîmade my throat tighten. She believed me. No one else did. But she did.

This wasn‚Äôt something she did lightly. Rhys‚Äôs family sat at the very top of the food chain‚Äîuntouchable. And I had no doubt her parents wouldn‚Äôt be thrilled to see her go up against them.

I curled deeper under the blanket and let out a slow breath.

Why couldn‚Äôt my parents love me like that?

Ever since their favorite daughter Houdini‚Äôd her way out of their master plan, I became Plan B. But that didn‚Äôt mean they forgave my existence.

Let‚Äôs be honest: the only reason they‚Äôd stopped actively berating me was because I got engaged to Rhys. That little arrangement somehow elevated me from ‚Äúirreparable family disgrace‚Äù to ‚Äúpotential saving grace.‚Äù

Part of the reason I agreed to the engagement‚Äîand I know how pathetic this sounds‚Äîwas because I thought maybe I could finally get something Katherine had: a sliver of parental affection. A crumb of approval.

But now that the engagement was off?

I was disposable again.

Last I heard, they were boxing up my things, ready to ship me off to some remote jungle where I‚Äôd spend the rest of my life befriending anacondas and repenting for my sins.

They were absolutely capable of that.

I groaned into my pillow. What the hell do I do now?

Unless‚Ä¶ I married someone more powerful than Rhys.

The idea was so ridiculous I snorted. Right. Because billionaires are just wandering around Sky City hoping to marry a 23-year-old orphan with no patience for their bullshit.

And yet‚Äî

A face flashed in my mind.

Three days ago. My new neighbor.

I remembered, quite inappropriately, thinking I wouldn‚Äôt mind being alone with him in his apartment where he could do all sorts of rated-R things to me.

I shook my head, quickly banishing the thought. I didn‚Äôt even know his name. Just that he had the kind of aura that could slice a person in half.

No. Way too dangerous.

I groaned again.

If I hadn‚Äôt broken that stupid mug, everything might‚Äôve been okay.

But it wasn‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs not. And there‚Äôs no going back.

Fuck! Why am I the one trying to fix this when I wasn‚Äôt even the one who messed it up?! I sat up‚Äîand bam, the door burst open.

Ivan marched in. ‚ÄúSleep is just going to make you feel worse. We‚Äôre getting up, and we‚Äôre going to find a dick worth loving‚Äîone that‚Äôs better than Rhys‚Äôs.‚Äù

WHAT?!

While I gaped, she had already changed me into a new outfit.

Just like that, we were off to Sky City‚Äôs most exclusive club‚Äîmembers only.

...

‚ÄúIs this really necessary?‚Äù I stood at the end of the line, shivering, tugging desperately at the hem of my tragically short skirt. I could practically feel it‚Äîif I opened my mouth to speak, my underwear would be on full display.

‚ÄúSweetheart, we paid a fortune to get into this place. Of course we‚Äôre going all kill. Do you not get it?‚Äù Ivanna declared like a mafia queen, standing tall against the icy wind in her five-inch heels without the slightest trace of fear.

‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt this a little too‚Äî‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even get to finish before a brutal gust of wind slapped me across the face like it had a personal vendetta. I immediately yanked up the zipper of my puffer jacket and curled into myself like a frozen shrimp.

Ivanna let out a dramatic groan. ‚ÄúMira, come on. We‚Äôre going to a bar, not an Arctic expedition.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad I won‚Äôt be hospitalized for hypothermia tonight, thanks,‚Äù I snapped back.

She rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might fall out of her head, gave me a once-over full of disappointment‚Äîbut said nothing more. Small victory. My puffer jacket was safe‚Äîfor now.

I‚Äôd thought we‚Äôd have to wait in line like everyone else. That was the whole reason I wore this thermal fortress of a coat. But clearly, I had underestimated Ivanna.

She had zero plans to follow the rules.

With the ease of someone who‚Äôd done this a thousand times, she slipped a rolled-up bill into the bouncer‚Äôs hand, her palm casually grazing his rock-hard chest like a Bond girl who‚Äôd forgotten her martini.

Ten seconds. That‚Äôs all it took. We were in.

Ivanna was the kind of beautiful that made men forget protocol‚Äîand ethics‚Äîin an instant.

And just like that, we breezed into Roxanne.

The place was thick with heat, perfume, and the effervescent scent of champagne. I ripped off my coat the second we stepped inside, only to be met with a ‚Äúare-you-trying-to-embarrass-me?‚Äù glare from Ivanna.

She handed her coat off to a passing server with a flick of her fingers, like she‚Äôd personally hired the man. Regal, effortless, born for this.

I tried to copy her moves. Failed miserably. Nearly dropped my purse and stumbled like a hamster who‚Äôd just woken up from a freezer nap.

Graceful? No. I looked like roadkill in Gucci heels.

If I hadn‚Äôt known each cocktail here cost about the same as my checking account balance, I might‚Äôve even convinced myself I was pulling it off.

‚ÄúJesus Christ!‚Äù I gasped, eyes glued to the menu like it had just insulted my entire bloodline.

Ivanna gave me a sideways glance and scoffed. ‚ÄúRelax. Tonight‚Äôs on me.‚Äù

I exhaled with something dangerously close to gratitude. Considering I‚Äôd nearly broken off an engagement, risked being exiled to some remote tropical island by my parents, and needed to budget for anti-snake spray, I needed all the charity I could get.

Price tags aside, the view was elite: ambitious young actors, outrageously good-looking models, and a legion of finance bros who looked like they gave TED talks while wearing Burberry.

It was a glittering buffet of vanity and hormones, wrapped in velvet lighting and the illusion of power.

We found a table near the bar and hadn‚Äôt even ordered drinks when a bartender locked eyes on us.

Well. He was hard to miss‚Äîtall, sculpted features, sleeves rolled to the elbows just enough to show off well-trained forearms.

He shouldn‚Äôt be mixing drinks‚Äîhe should be in the Louvre. Or at the very least starring in Dior‚Äôs newest fragrance campaign. Maybe that‚Äôs why this club was so expensive: even the staff had to be perfect.

‚ÄúTwo 75s, French brandy,‚Äù

Before I could even locate the cheapest drink on the menu, Ivanna had already tossed her order at the bartender. ‚ÄúMake it strong.‚Äù

And of course, she didn‚Äôt forget to flash her signature smile‚Äîthe one that balanced perfectly between sexy and innocent, chin tilted just enough to say ‚ÄúOops, didn‚Äôt mean to flirt‚Äù.

The bartender reached effortlessly for the gin, giving her a half-smile. ‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù

‚ÄúMore like an engagement-level disaster,‚Äù she said, casually pointing her thumb at me. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs wrapping up real soon.‚Äù

I glanced at her. ‚ÄúThrilled that my personal life is now public broadcast.‚Äù

She patted my hand with mock sympathy. ‚ÄúSweetie, this place runs on romantic catastrophes. Without bad decisions, no one would be buying drinks.‚Äù

Then she turned away and melted into the crowd, flipping into Social Queen Mode like someone had hit a switch.

In under ten seconds, she completed a visual sweep‚Äîlike a hawk zeroing in on prey‚Äîbefore spinning back around and pointing her perfectly manicured finger toward the edge of the dance floor.

‚ÄúOkay, listen. You need a rebound. Exhibit A: Six-foot-two, hair neater than your ex-fianc√©‚Äôs moral compass, shirt unbuttoned just enough to scream sexy without slipping into cheap. He either owns a yacht or, at the very least, a VIP card.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

Her eyes flicked to a new direction. ‚ÄúExhibit B: struggling musician. Dressed like payday hasn‚Äôt happened yet, but he‚Äôs hot enough you‚Äôd forgive him. You‚Äôd fund his next album and still sleep like a baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúPass.‚Äù

She sighed, then pointed again. ‚ÄúFine. Exhibit C: total dad vibes‚Äîbut the good kind. Like ‚Äòbooks your doctor‚Äôs appointment and your breakfast‚Äô dad, not ‚Äòcalls the waitress ‚Äòsweetheart‚Äô and thinks climate change is a myth‚Äô dad.‚Äù

I groaned into my hands. ‚ÄúIvanna, please.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt back down. ‚ÄúMira, you cannot sit here like a decorative wall gecko. Tonight is about rebooting your life, not stitching up emotional wounds.‚Äù

Just as she geared up for a fourth round of rebound recommendations, she suddenly froze. It was like someone had hit mute on her entire system.

Then, far too casually, she said, ‚ÄúHey, want to hit the bathroom?‚Äù

I narrowed my eyes. ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Or maybe let‚Äôs move tables? The vibe here‚Äôs weird.‚Äù Her smile was tight, and her voice cracked like a pair of worn-out heels.

Weird vibe? We‚Äôd only been sitting for ten minutes, and we just ordered drinks. By Ivanna‚Äôs standards, we hadn‚Äôt even made it past the opening credits.

Then I followed her gaze.

A half-private booth.

Rhys.

He had his arm draped around a woman. Her head rested on his shoulder, makeup flawless, smile polished and effortless.

I didn‚Äôt need more details.

That face‚ÄîI would never forget it.

Four years ago, a girl vanished under mysterious circumstances. I, in all my naive glory, believed she had simply ‚Äústepped aside,‚Äù choosing to selflessly walk away from a future with Rhys.

And now, here was Katherine‚Äîperched on my ex-fianc√©‚Äôs lap, locked in a pose so intimate it looked less like a casual bar date and more like a budget version of Fifty Shades of Grey.

I had told myself I was over it. Over him. We‚Äôd broken up. It was done. Time to move on.

Until I heard what came next.

‚ÄúHonestly, I didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd fall apart over a coffee mug.‚Äù

Katherine‚Äôs voice was soft, full of false pity‚Äîthe kind that sounded like she‚Äôd just killed someone and was now gently tucking a blanket over the body.

She gently swirled the wine in her glass, her lips curling into a near-perfect smile. ‚ÄúOf course I put that mug somewhere obvious. I wanted her to notice. After all, she still doesn‚Äôt know you‚Äôve been seeing me behind her back. It was time she caught a little hint, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

She looked up at Rhys, eyes glowing with admiration. ‚ÄúHonestly though, darling, your performance was spot-on. Even I almost believed you were worried she‚Äôd find out about us, instead of just helping me pull off the scene. She‚Äôs so stupid‚Äîof course she thought you were upset about the mug, not terrified of exposing your affair.‚Äù

Rhys chuckled softly, smug and relaxed. ‚ÄúI had to act like I cared. She spends every day trying to be the perfect girlfriend. If she found out all her effort still couldn‚Äôt compete with you, she‚Äôd lose it.‚Äù

Katherine laughed under her breath and patted his chest. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. Knowing Mira, she‚Äôs probably still scrambling to fix things. She‚Äôs the type who always believes that if she just tries hard enough, people will finally see her worth.‚Äù

Her laugh turned soft, laced with pity so sharp it felt like a blade. ‚ÄúBut the harder she tries, the more pathetic she looks. And me? I just ‚Äòhappened‚Äô to return home. Her parents don‚Äôt know a thing. They didn‚Äôt even get the chance to stop me. Tomorrow, I‚Äôll be seeing them in broad daylight‚Äîbecause she gave up the engagement herself, and you, dear, are blameless.‚Äù

Katherine leaned back with a triumphant sigh. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this the best ending? I never gave up on you. I was just waiting for her to step aside.‚Äù

Rhys nodded slowly, a small smirk on his lips. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. You always are.‚Äù

A loud roar filled my ears, and my heartbeat pounded against my skull like a war drum.

Ivanna must‚Äôve been saying something‚Äîpleading with me to stay calm, not to do anything stupid‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt hear a word.

I wasn‚Äôt the same Mira who swallowed her pride for praise anymore.

I slipped free from Ivanna‚Äôs grip and turned to the bartender. ‚ÄúYour best red. Put it on Rhys Granger‚Äôs tab.‚Äù

The bartender‚Äîbless his beautiful, rule-breaking soul‚Äîdidn‚Äôt even flinch. He handed me the bottle like I‚Äôd just ordered mineral water.

With the bottle in hand, I had a mission. A singular, burning purpose.

The bouncer moved to stop me, but one look at my face‚Äîlike a vengeful goddess straight from hell‚Äîmade him wisely back off, hands raised in surrender.

I marched straight toward Rhys and Katherine. They were lip-locked in some dramatic, second-rate soap opera make-out scene.

I raised the bottle‚Äîand smashed it, with all my strength.

Glass shattered with a sharp crack, spraying across the table. Rhys‚Äôs forehead split instantly, a trail of blood beginning to drip down between his brows.

Katherine screamed and leapt off his lap. ‚ÄúMirabelle?! Are you insane?! What are you doing here?!‚Äù

She scrambled to find a lie, panic rising in her voice. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre misunderstanding, it‚Äôs not what you think‚Äî‚Äù

Rhys cut her off, his hand gripping her arm, his gaze dark and frigid. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother explaining, Katherine. It doesn‚Äôt matter. My parents will take your side, no matter what. We‚Äôre just correcting an old mistake.‚Äù

Katherine‚Äôs panic twisted into smugness in an instant. She curled into his side with sickening sweetness and cooed, ‚ÄúOh, honey, your head‚Äôs bleeding. We have to get to the hospital.‚Äù

Before I could say anything, Ivanna rushed to my side, fury radiating from every pore. She raised her hand, ready to slap Katherine straight back to whatever pit she'd crawled out of. ‚ÄúYou disgusting, two-faced bitch‚Äî!‚Äù

Beijing has unveiled what it calls the world‚Äôs first shopping mall dedicated entirely to robots, signaling a major milestone in China‚Äôs effort to bring humanoid technology into everyday life. Dubbed the¬†*Robot Mall*, the four-story facility in Beijing‚Äôs E-Town district follows a 4S dealership model, offering sales, service, spare parts, and customer surveys under one roof. It features over 100 types of robots from nearly 200 brands, including industry leaders like Ubtech Robotics and Unitree Robotics.

Prices range from affordable gadgets (around $278) to cutting-edge humanoids costing millions. Among the standout exhibits is a lifelike Albert Einstein robot priced at $97,000, alongside robotic dogs, chess-playing machines, and animatronic figures of historical icons such as Emperor Qin Shi Huang, Isaac Newton, and poet Li Bai. The mall also highlights practical applications, with robots designed for cooking, coffee-making, pharmacy dispensing, painting, and even sports. An entertainment zone hosts robot soccer and track competitions, while a fully automated restaurant employs robotic chefs and waiters.

The opening coincides with the¬†*2025 World Robot Conference*¬†(August 8‚Äì12) and precedes the inaugural¬†*World Humanoid Robot Games*¬†(August 14‚Äì17), where teams from 20+ countries will compete in athletics, dance, and soccer. China‚Äôs aggressive robotics push aligns with its economic strategy, including over $20 billion in subsidies last year and plans for a $137 billion fund targeting AI and robotics startups. The initiative also addresses demographic challenges like an aging population and slowing growth by positioning robots as everyday aids rather than futuristic curiosities.

Unlike traditional business-to-business robotics sales, the mall emphasizes hands-on interaction to foster consumer adoption. Store director Wang Yifan told Reuters:¬†*""If robots are to enter thousands of households, relying solely on robotics companies is not enough.""* The project reflects China‚Äôs ambition to lead not just in manufacturing but in cultural acceptance of human-robot integration. Industry analysts note the dual purpose of the launch: commercial retail and a global showcase of China‚Äôs technological prowess.

However, experts caution that success hinges on balancing automation with human collaboration. As Hexagon CTO Burkhard Boeckem puts it:¬†*‚ÄúWe believe the most resilient and competitive organisations will be those that treat autonomy as a scaffold for human potential, not a replacement for it.‚Äù* The mall‚Äôs performance could inspire similar ventures worldwide, if it proves robots can transition from factory floors to family homes.

The Flame That Never Asked for Applause

J & D - Age 37

SEASIDE CABIN: FRIDAY EVENING


The cabin sat on the edge of a bluff,facing west.

No Wi-Fi.
No itinerary.

Just two nights, two toothbrushes, and one promise:

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be us again. 
Not just who we‚Äôve had to be.‚Äù

Joaquim unpacked slowly, his favorite linen shirt, the one Dashiell always reached for.

Dashiell stood barefoot on the deck, hoodie unzipped, watching the tide roll like breath.

-----

CABIN BEDROOM: NIGHT


The room glowed gold from a single lamp.

The air smelled of eucalyptus and cedar.

Their bags lay open.
Their clothes were not yet put away.

Joaquim stood behind Dashiell at the mirror.

Hands at his hips.
Nose at his neck.

‚ÄúYou still want me?‚Äù

Dashiell met his eyes in the mirror.

‚ÄúEvery version.
Especially the tired, soft-eyed one who still knows how to pull me back into myself.‚Äù

Joaquim undressed him slowly.
Not with hunger.

With gratitude.

They didn‚Äôt rush.

They kissed like a language that only they could read.

Joaquim whispered something in softly.

Dashiell didn‚Äôt hear the words,
but his body answered.

And when they lay tangled in the sheets, the candle still flickering - Joaquim traced the space above Dashiell‚Äôs heart and said:

‚ÄúWe never stopped being us.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù 
Dashiell breathed.

‚ÄúWe just took turns reminding each other.‚Äù


üîä ADULT JOAQUIM

‚ÄúOur love never needed to perform.

It just needed to be touched once in a while.

So we did.

We never forgot the fire.

We just learned how to keep it warm.‚Äù


-----


The Years That Still Belong to Us


J & D  - Age 37, dreaming toward 50

CABIN: EARLY MORNING


The light was honey-gold.

The ocean fog sat just offshore.

The fire had gone to embers.
Dashiell woke first.

Stretched.

Stood in his boxers on the deck, arms crossed.

Joaquim stirred not long after, pulling the blanket over his shoulder, then blinking against the sun.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up early,‚Äù 
he murmured.

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt sleep.
My brain wouldn‚Äôt shut up.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill worried about the kids?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.

Still thinking about us.‚Äù

They sat outside on Adirondack chairs, wrapped in throws, mugs of coffee steaming between them.

‚ÄúDo you realize,‚Äù 
Dashiell said,

‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna be done in fifteen years?‚Äù

‚ÄúDone?‚Äù

‚ÄúRetired.

Free.

Fifty.‚Äù

Joaquim grinned.

‚ÄúYou make that sound old.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is.

It‚Äôs deliciously old.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are we gonna do?‚Äù

Dashiell shrugged.
‚ÄúWhatever we want.‚Äù

‚ÄúThink the kids will still come visit?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly if we promise pancakes and bad advice.‚Äù

They laughed.

Then went quiet again.
The good kind of quiet.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù 

Joaquim asked.

‚ÄúMore of this.
More mornings where we aren‚Äôt just recovering.

We‚Äôre beginning.‚Äù

Joaquim nodded.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start designing it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúOur after.
The life after legacy.‚Äù


üîäADULT DASHIELL

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt build a life to escape from.

We built one we get to stay in.

And when we‚Äôre done building,
we‚Äôll still have each other.

And a fire that never went out.‚Äù



‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óè



The House at the Edge of the World

Family - Ages 37 (J & D), 15 (Micah & Eira)

FAMILY LIVING ROOM: EVENING


The kids were upstairs.

Micah strumming a guitar.

Eira journaling near an open window.

Downstairs, Joaquim and Dashiell spread out paperwork on the kitchen table, maps, blueprints, and a folder labeled:

PLAYA DE LUZ - COSTA RICA

Four bedrooms.

Open-plan.

Windows that swallowed sunlight.

And a wide wraparound porch made for coffee, thunder, and grandchildren.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a someday thing anymore,‚Äù 
Dashiell said.

‚ÄúThis is the next fire we live inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll keep the house here for holidays. 
But Costa Rica?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs home.‚Äù

Micah‚Äôs footsteps thumped down the stairs.

‚ÄúWhatcha guys whispering about?‚Äù

Joaquim motioned him over.

‚ÄúCome see.‚Äù

Eira followed, curious.

They leaned over the table.
Read the notes.

Saw the blue sea in the photos.
Micah blinked.

‚ÄúWait. 
Are you guys‚Ä¶ moving?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù 
Dashiell said.

‚ÄúBut eventually.‚Äù

Eira looked up.
‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ invited?‚Äù

Joaquim smiled.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre woven into the walls, baby.‚Äù

Micah nodded slowly.

‚ÄúIt looks peaceful.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt will be,‚Äù 
Dashiell said.

‚ÄúBut not because it‚Äôs quiet,
because we made it true.‚Äù


üîäADULT EIRA

‚ÄúThey built a life here.
But they dreamed a future at the edge of the world.

And they invited us into it,
not as children.

But as keepers of the fire.‚Äù



‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã




The Fire, the Ocean, and Everything Between

Micah & Eira  - Age 17 / J & D  -  Age 39

PLAYA DE LUZ:  BACKYARD; NIGHT


The bonfire cracked with deep-orange rhythm.

Its glow reached the palms.

The waves beyond whispered soft percussion, like they were listening in.

Micah tossed driftwood into the flame, then sat back in the sand.

Eira wore a long cotton wrap from the market that morning, purple, gold, threadbare in a way that felt ancient.

Joaquim carried out a tray of grilled sweet plantains and gallo pinto wrapped in banana leaves.

Dashiell followed, holding two small clay bowls filled with agua dulce.

Local neighbors had joined:

Luis, a fisherman with a constellation of tattoos on his forearm.

Marta, a retired schoolteacher who spoke Spanish the way music dreams of sounding.

Her niece, Isabela, a slow-smiling teenage poet Eira had been exchanging verses with all week.

The family spoke a mix of English and Spanish now.

Half learned.
Half absorbed.

But all of it felt like home.

----

EARLIER THAT DAY:  THE MARKETPLACE


Micah and Dashiell had gone into town together.

‚ÄúWe need salt,‚Äù 
Dashiell said.

‚ÄúDo we need handmade ceramics, too?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fifty percent less disciplined on vacation.‚Äù

Luis waved them over to his fish stall.

He didn‚Äôt speak English.
But he didn‚Äôt need to.

He handed Micah a fresh red snapper wrapped in palm husk.

Touched his chest and said:

‚ÄúPara la memoria.‚Äù

Micah blinked.

‚ÄúFor the memory?‚Äù

Luis smiled.
Nodded.

And just like that, the exchange became ritual.

----


BONFIRE: NIGHT


Everyone had eaten.

Now came the stories.

Marta was telling one about the luz del mar  - the sea light that appears only to those who speak aloud what they most want.

‚ÄúIf you whisper it,‚Äù she said, voice velvet, ‚Äúit stays inside you.

But if you say it clearly, the sea might answer.‚Äù

Eira looked up.

‚ÄúHas it answered you?‚Äù

Marta smiled.

‚ÄúOnce.
And now my house is always full of guests.‚Äù

They laughed.

Then Joaquim stood.

‚ÄúCan I try?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou must,‚Äù Marta said.


----


BONFIRE CIRCLE: CONTINUOUS


Joaquim stepped toward the edge of the firelight.

The shadows painted gold across his chest.

He looked to his children.
Then to Dashiell.

‚ÄúI want time,‚Äù 
he said.

‚ÄúMore of it.

With the man I‚Äôve loved in every language I could never speak.

And with these children, whose names became the spell that saved me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to grow old and not be afraid.

I want to watch my daughter make people nervous with her power.

And I want to see my son teach softness to the world without shame.‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúI want to live long enough that they forget who we were trying to impress.

And only remember who we held when the world got quiet.‚Äù

Silence.

Then applause.

Laughter.

And something unspeakably soft in the air, like the sea had just leaned in to listen.

LATER: INSIDE THE HOUSE


Micah journaled beside the open screen door, listening to the wind,
writing in both English and Spanish now.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm becoming more than they expected,‚Äù 
he wrote.

‚ÄúBut somehow, exactly what they dreamed.‚Äù

Eira and Isabela sat on the roof,
passing a single pen between them, writing one line each of a poem.

No translations.

Just rhythm.

Just the sound of legacy being remixed.

Inside, Joaquim and Dashiell curled on the couch, legs tangled,
the fire from the pit still glowing through the window.

‚ÄúYou think they‚Äôll want this house someday?‚Äù 
Dashiell whispered.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù 
Joaquim smiled.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll want what it gave us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich is?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe permission to rest.
The chance to love without proving anything.

The freedom to say yes to the next life.‚Äù


üîäADULT EIRA

‚ÄúThe ocean didn‚Äôt speak back in words.

But it heard everything.

And in its quiet, it told us we were home.‚Äù


‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óè



The Light That Came Slowly


Micah - Age 17 / Joaquim  -  Age 39

COSTA RICA:  SHORELINE:  5:41 AM


The world was still blue.

That specific blue that only comes when the ocean hasn‚Äôt fully let go of night.

Micah  walked barefoot across the cool sand.

His hoodie sleeves pulled over his fists, sketchbook under one arm.

A few steps behind him,
Joaquim  walked in silence.

They didn‚Äôt speak for the first ten minutes.

Only the sound of tide, and breath, and distance shrinking.
Finally

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt sleep?‚Äù 
Joaquim asked.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt want to.‚Äù

‚ÄúDreams or thoughts?‚Äù

‚ÄúBoth.‚Äù

Micah stopped near the waterline.

Opened his sketchbook.

Held it up for his father to see.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs us,‚Äù he said.

The page showed a tree growing from two hands, its branches carrying shapes that were not leaves,but rooms.

Micah pointed.

‚ÄúThat one‚Äôs the kitchen.
That‚Äôs the porch.
And that one, that‚Äôs the fire we always sat beside.‚Äù

Joaquim blinked fast.
Didn‚Äôt speak.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt draw myself in it,‚Äù 
Micah said.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I think‚Ä¶I‚Äôve been living in you.

For a long time.
And now...

I think I‚Äôm ready to build my own shape.‚Äù

Joaquim reached for his hand.

Held it like it still belonged to a child, and always would.

‚ÄúThen make it beautiful, mijo.
But never forget: you were always your own shape.

We just got the honor of tracing you first.‚Äù

The sun finally cracked the edge of the ocean.

Micah turned.

Smiled.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go wake them up.‚Äù


üîäADULT MICAH

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt the ocean that made me whole.

It was the walk beside someone who never asked me to shrink
while I found my edge.‚Äù


-----


The Stillness That Let Me Ask

Eira  - Age 17 / Dashiell -  Age 39
EXT. COSTA RICA:  BLUFF TRAIL:  6:02 AM


The path was narrow and damp with dew.

Tall grass brushed against their shins.

The air smelled of salt and something wild and clean.

Eira walked ahead, hands in the pockets of her wrap skirt, hair twisted up in a loose knot.

Dashiell followed a pace behind, carrying a thermos and two paper cups.

When they reached the clearing, the one that overlooked both the sea and the mountains behind it,
they sat on a flat rock still holding the night‚Äôs chill.

He poured the coffee.
She took it without a word.
They watched the sun rise over two horizons.

Then,
‚ÄúPapa?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you know you were safe to love Dad?‚Äù

Dashiell blinked.
Not from shock.

But from how much she already knew.

‚ÄúBecause he never looked at me like I was something to win.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen how did he look at you?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike he‚Äôd already chosen me,
and was just waiting to see if I‚Äôd believe it.‚Äù

Eira sipped.
Nodded.

‚ÄúYou think that kind of love comes again?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe not the same shape.
But the same truth?

Yeah.

I think it‚Äôs always nearby.
It just gets quiet when we‚Äôre scared to name it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm scared sometimes.
That I‚Äôll ask for too much.‚Äù

Dashiell set his cup down.

‚ÄúAsk anyway.
And if someone flinches,
they were never going to hold it anyway.‚Äù

Eira leaned into his shoulder.

They watched the sun break like a soft promise across the water.

‚ÄúI want what you have,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúThen don‚Äôt settle for anything that doesn‚Äôt see you in your full light.‚Äù


üîäADULT EIRA

‚ÄúHe never rushed me.
He just stood there, long enough for me to believe I deserved the ground I was standing on.‚Äù


------



What We Carried Home
Final Morning - Beach House -  Age 39 / 17

PLAYA DE LUZ: KITCHEN; 8:17 AM


Sunlight poured through the open windows like warm water.

The breeze carried the smell of salt and mango.

Eira stood barefoot at the stove, flipping cornmeal pancakes, humming something without lyrics.

Micah set four plates at the table, placing a fresh-picked hibiscus at the center like a quiet offering.

Dashiell sliced avocado.

Joaquim squeezed limes for juice.

No one said much,
but the air was thick with belonging.

-----



DINING ROOM: LATER


They sat together.

Simple food.
Sticky fingers.

Soft clinks of forks on ceramic.
Joaquim reached for a napkin, then paused.

‚ÄúBefore we head home‚Ä¶
I want us each to name one thing we‚Äôre bringing back with us.

Not an object.
A truth.‚Äù

Micah went first.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid to be soft anymore.

Even when I don‚Äôt have answers.‚Äù

Eira:

‚ÄúI can ask for love that fits me,
not squeeze into something someone else calls enough.‚Äù

Dashiell looked at Joaquim.

‚ÄúI still want you.
Not out of habit.
But because you keep becoming.
And I want to witness it.‚Äù

Joaquim blinked back tears.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to carry the world.
I just need to build a table where we all fit.‚Äù

Silence.

Then forks moved again.
Pancakes were eaten.

Laughter returned.


üîäADULT MICHAH

‚ÄúThat house didn‚Äôt make us whole.

It just gave us time to hear what was already inside us.

And that was enough.‚Äù


------



The Tide Took Nothing from Us

Final Moments -  Costa Rica  -  Age 17 / 39

PLAYA DE LUZ - EARLY EVENING


The suitcases were packed.

The linens folded.

The books returned to the shelves.

But no one was ready to leave just yet.

Micah and Eira walked the shoreline barefoot, letting the tide kiss their ankles.

Joaquim and Dashiell stood a few paces back,
hands clasped, shoulders brushing.

‚ÄúIt feels like we buried something here,‚Äù 
Dashiell said.

‚ÄúOr uncovered it.‚Äù

They watched the kids lean their heads together in quiet laughter.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not ours anymore,‚Äù Joaquim whispered.

‚ÄúThey never were,‚Äù 
Dashiell said.

‚ÄúThey just chose us first.‚Äù


-----


PORCH: MOMENTS LATER


Eira tucked a small shell into the corner of her sketchbook.

Micah scribbled coordinates on the back of a receipt.

Joaquim set down the keys.
Paused.

‚ÄúOne last thing.‚Äù

He walked to the edge of the sand.

Kneeled.

And with his finger, drew four names in the tide-warmed earth.

Micah. 
Eira. 
Dashiell. 
Joaquim.

As the wave came in,
he whispered:

‚ÄúThank you.
For teaching us how to stay.‚Äù

The water did not erase the names quickly.

It lingered.
Held them.

Then lifted them away like a blessing.


üîäADULT EIRA

‚ÄúSome places don‚Äôt ask you to remember them.

They simply become a part of your breath.

Costa Rica was where we rested.

Where we said,
‚ÄòWe made it.
We made us.‚Äô‚Äù


‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã


The Doors They Walked Through Without Us

Micah & Eira - Age 18 / J & D - Age 40

AIRPORT TERMINAL -  MID-AUGUST


Two rolling suitcases.

Two tote bags.

Four tearful goodbyes held just beneath the skin.

Micah wore a hoodie with the sleeves cut off, headphones around his neck.

His sketchbook poked out of his backpack, the edges worn.

Eira had a poetry anthology tucked under one arm,
a gold necklace from Fraya around her throat, and her passport in a front pocket.

Always ready.

Joaquim and Dashiell walked a few steps behind them.

Not rushing.
Not speaking.

Just watching the miracle of their own becoming walk away.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre ready,‚Äù 
Joaquim said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the ones who aren‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure it out.

We always do.‚Äù

‚ÄúNext stop: Scotland.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt kiss goodbye at the gate.

They kissed hello to the next life.




‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã



AIRBNB -  EDINBURGH: ONE WEEK LATER


Rain tapped on stone rooftops.
The windows of the flat fogged with tea steam and breath.

Joaquim stood at the counter, reading through a pamphlet on the Highland migration.

Dashiell looked out over the city, gray, ancient, home in his bones.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù 
Joaquim asked.

‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm in someone else‚Äôs memory.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe we are.‚Äù

That night, they walked the Royal Mile.

Ate cullen skink and buttered oatcakes in a pub where Dashiell‚Äôs grandfather once sang.

They visited the archives.

Found a census line with Lachlan Donnachaidh‚Äôs name scrawled in ink.

Dashiell wept quietly.

Joaquim took his hand.

‚ÄúYou never left this place,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou just became something it didn‚Äôt know how to hold yet.‚Äù



üîäADULT MICAH


‚ÄúThey gave us the future.

But they still had chapters left to live.

And that‚Äôs what Scotland was:
A way of saying ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre still writing, too.‚Äô‚Äù

The Stone That Remembered Our Names

Edinburgh, Scotland - Joaquim & Dashiell - FLAT:  MORNING LIGHT


The windows were thick with condensation.

Outside, the old city stretched in wet cobblestone and soft mist.
Buses whispered. 

Church bells tolled faintly in the gray.

Joaquim stirred oatmeal on the stovetop.

Dashiell sat at the small kitchen table, leafing through a bound journal labeled:

Donnachaidh Lineage, 1827 - Present

The print was faded.

The names weren‚Äôt stories yet- just ghosts in ink.

But he whispered each one aloud.

As if calling them forward.

----

GREYFRIARS KIRKYARD: LATER THAT MORNING


The churchyard was damp.

Rows of crooked stones leaned like bones that had learned how to rest.

Joaquim and Dashiell walked slowly, arms brushing.

Dashiell held a small wax-sealed envelope in his hand.

It contained a letter.

Not addressed to anyone alive.

‚ÄúLachlan,‚Äù 
he said quietly.

‚ÄúThat name never left me.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in you,‚Äù 
Joaquim whispered.

They stopped before a weathered stone, cracked diagonally, carved with curling script:

‚ÄúDonnachaidh, 1882.
Shepherd. 
Son. 
Brother.‚Äù

No dates. 
No flourish.

Just truth carved simply.

Dashiell knelt.

Placed the envelope at the base of the stone.

Then pressed his palm to the moss-lined granite.

‚ÄúYou held this name so I could carry it forward my way.

And now it lives in a house with four names, in a girl with a voice like stormlight, and a boy who draws wings on dragons and calls them ‚Äòhome.‚Äô""

Joaquim stood behind him.

Quiet.
Unmoving.
Witness.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt know what this love looked like.

But you kept the line unbroken.
Thank you.‚Äù

They said nothing more.

The mist said the rest.

----


EDINBURGH FLAT: THAT NIGHT


The fire crackled.

Rain tapped softly on the old glass.

The kitchen smelled of whisky, buttered shortbread, and memory.

Joaquim sat at the table, pen in hand.

Writing.
A letter.

Letter to Micah and Eira (Unsent)

My loves,
*We came here to remember your roots, but instead, we found our own.

The stone didn‚Äôt speak.
But we heard it.

And it told us that what we built with you, our table, our rhythm, our love, was exactly what they were praying for, even if they didn‚Äôt know how to name it yet.*

*I saw your names in the gravestones.

In the curves of old letters.

In the fog that wrapped around Dashiell‚Äôs shoulders as if to say:

‚ÄúWe never let go.‚Äù*

*This place doesn‚Äôt feel like the past.

It feels like permission.

To rest.
To dream new.
To love boldly and carry gently.

One day, when you come here, I hope you hear the quiet the way we did.

It‚Äôs not silence.
It‚Äôs continuation.
Love always,
Pappa*


----- 


ARTHUR‚ÄôS SEAT: SUNRISE; FINAL DAY


They hiked before dawn.

No words. 

Just wind and memory.

At the summit, Joaquim pulled a stone from his jacket pocket.

The same one he had drawn their four names into on their last night in Costa Rica.

He placed it on the edge of the hilltop.

Pressed his forehead to it.

‚ÄúThis is where we leave it,‚Äù 
he whispered.

‚ÄúNot behind.
But forward.‚Äù

Dashiell stood beside him.
Hand on his back.

And the two of them, barefoot on holy ground, closed their eyes.

And let everything they had carried until now rise into light.


üîä ADULT EIRA

‚ÄúWhen they came home,
they brought no souvenirs.
Just permission.

To carry what mattered.
To let go of what didn‚Äôt.

And to name ourselves
without asking first.‚Äù


------


They Walked Into Their Names

Micah & Eira - Age 18 / J & D  Age 40



 UNIVERSITY DROP-OFF: LATE SUMMER


It was the second goodbye.

But this one felt louder.

Micah adjusted the strap of his satchel.

His dorm key hung on a lanyard that read Faculty of Fine Arts.

Eira wore an oversized blazer over a poetry-printed tee.

Her bag had a sticker that said:

‚ÄúHistory is not behind us.
It‚Äôs inside us.‚Äù

Joaquim placed his hand on Micah‚Äôs shoulder.

Dashiell hugged Eira in that quiet way, like he‚Äôd never stopped holding her, just made more room.

They didn‚Äôt cry this time.

They‚Äôd already learned how to ache with grace.

‚ÄúText when you‚Äôve eaten,‚Äù Dashiell said.

‚ÄúWe always do,‚Äù 
Micah replied.

‚ÄúNot because you have to,‚Äù Joaquim added.

‚ÄúBut because we like the sound of you arriving safely.‚Äù


----


STUDENT RESIDENCE: LATER THAT NIGHT


Micah sat alone at his desk.

Unpacked.

Sketchbook open.

A note from Joaquim taped inside the cover:

‚ÄúDraw until the page becomes your name.‚Äù

He smiled.
And began.

Eira lit a single candle in her dorm window.

She‚Äôd brought the family map, folded and worn, but intact.

She whispered:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lost.
Just becoming.‚Äù

And began to write.


üîäADULT MICHAH

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt walk away.

We walked forward.

Carrying everything that ever held us, and making space for everything we hadn‚Äôt yet touched.‚Äù

What the Silence Gave Back to Us

J & D - Age 40
DONNACHAIDH: BARNES HOME: EVENING


The hallway echoed now.

The laughter had faded into memory.

The fridge was less full.

The laundry less frequent.
And the quiet?

It was deafening at first.

Then‚Ä¶ sacred.

Joaquim stood in the kitchen, barefoot, making two cups of tea.

The same way he always had.

Dashiell came in from the back garden, earth still under his nails.

He set a small pot of basil on the counter.

‚ÄúThey called,‚Äù 
he said.

‚ÄúBoth of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey good?‚Äù

‚ÄúMicah had his first studio critique.

Eira‚Äôs submitting to a journal.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre flying.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe built their wings.‚Äù

They sat at the table.

No rush.
No noise.

Just two men who still wanted each other.

‚ÄúDo you miss it?‚Äù 
Joaquim asked.

‚ÄúThe chaos?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe closeness.‚Äù

Dashiell reached across the table.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt miss anything.
Because it made us.

And you‚Äôre still here.

And I still wake up wanting to touch your back and say ‚Äòthank you.‚Äô‚Äù

Joaquim smiled.

‚ÄúSo now what?‚Äù

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù 
Dashiell said,

‚Äúwe keep becoming.‚Äù


üîäADULT EIRA

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt stop being our home.
They just let the rooms breathe.
And somehow, that taught us how to come back.‚Äù

We Taught the Wind Our Names

Many years later - Joaquim & Dashiell - Age 72



COSTA RICA:  PORCH OF THE BEACH HOUSE  TWILIGHT


The air was thick with hibiscus and ocean salt.

Two chairs.

One old table between them.
Two mugs of ginger tea.

The light just beginning to go gold.

Dashiell sat with a blanket across his knees, watching the tide.

Joaquim stepped onto the porch holding a leather-bound book,
the family map, now decades old.

The spine worn, edges softened by years of hands and tears.

He sat beside him.
Said nothing.

They didn‚Äôt have to fill the silence anymore.

They had become it.

‚ÄúDid you hear from Micah?‚Äù Dashiell asked.

‚ÄúThis morning.
They‚Äôre finishing that illustrated novel, the one about the tree that grows houses instead of leaves.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Eira?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs giving a lecture in Nairobi next month.
Poetry and cultural memory.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe always had the fire.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo did you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou taught me how to keep it lit.‚Äù

They sipped.

The ocean breathed.

Joaquim opened the map.

Not to look at it.

To hold it.

Like a name.

-----


INSIDE THE HOUSE:  EARLIER THAT DAY


A letter sat sealed on the desk.
Addressed to:

Micah & Eira

To be opened when you‚Äôre ready to come home.

LETTER: VOICEOVER JOAQUIM‚ÄôS HANDWRITING


*We never had a rulebook.

We never claimed to know how to do this.

But what we had, what we always had, was choice.

Every morning, I woke up and chose your papa.

And then I chose you.

Even before we met you, we chose you.

In the way we fought to build something soft.

In the way we burned down what the world told us was the only way.*

*You were never asked to become us.

You were given space.

To become you.

But if you ever wonder where you came from, here‚Äôs the answer:*

*You came from persistence.

You came from prayer without sound.

You came from men who touched each other with reverence.

And you came from yes.

Again and again, yes.*


-----

PORCH: SUNSET CONTINUOUS


The sky burned apricot and mauve.

Joaquim leaned back, closed his eyes.

Dashiell reached over and laced their fingers together.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs almost time,‚Äù Joaquim whispered.

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor the next voice to speak.‚Äù

They sat in the hush of it.

As the waves washed the edge of the world.


‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óã‚óè


FUTURE: YEARS LATER; MICHAH‚ÄôS STUDIO


Micah (now grown) stands before a canvas, his father‚Äôs handwriting etched into the background in graphite.

In front:
A house.
On fire.

But not burning down.
Becoming light.


------
 

EIRA‚ÄôS STUDY: NIGHT


She reads the letter again.

Touches her lips to the signature.
Then writes her own poem across the bottom:

My fathers loved in full sentences.

Never punctuation.

Only pause when prayer called them to.

And now I write because they didn‚Äôt ask me to remember.

*They asked me to continue. *


‚óè‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óã



BEACH HOUSE: YEARS FROM NOW


A child runs across the sand.

Small feet.
Wide eyes.

Laughter that already knows it belongs.

From inside the house, a voice calls:

‚ÄúCome in, love. 
Dinner‚Äôs ready.‚Äù

The child turns back, waves to the ocean.

To the porch.

To the ghosts that are not ghosts,
but home.


üîäFINAL

This was our promise:

That we would not disappear.

That love like ours does not end in silence, it teaches the wind our names.

And when the wind learns you...
*it never forgets. *

The Promise



The end.

And aspired for knowledge and coding. Job situation never got better, it's just me who lost motivation to pursue coding anymore, when I've got some money from working in it (but at end of college, 3 years later).

I had no fun in college, I just couldn't even if I wanted to, I had to learn, that's all I had. We're talking poor to such measures that going to coffee is much expense to me. I didn't had desktop, and felt inferior and unworthy in college that prevented from making real connections. Felt ashamed to only have such weak laptop, and supposedly have so much knowledge about coding and stuff. Felt unworthy of connections with anyone. Had crooked teeth, what more indicator I'm poor than bad teeth simple (600‚Ç¨) braces can do? Now at end of college, parents remembered to pay me braces, now when all opportunities are gone. At least at job interviews they won't look me weird (not serious) with crooked teeth.

And now no wonder I'm 24, friendless, and no idea what to do with future, when I'm sick of working anymore. I've given my best in classes and study, and got sick of it. I may have desktop from money I've saved up, but I'm sick of gaming now as well.

I've prayed throughout college to pass exams, and I did, but I always was simply sad, from 1st to 3rd (last) year, I was simply sad, when I needed to study harder for some hard exam, but I just sucked it up, and given my best. Even then prayers felt hollow, they're just... painful.. My sincere prayers are really just pure sadness and cry. And I can't do nothing about my future or life to change it. Even in college I struggled with these questions. It's just that I'm at end of it, and now I feel empty because there's no more studying, nothing to distract me anymore...

I've finished with average grade (europe) of 8.6. I know on paper it's amazing, but I don't feel nothing anymore, and job prospects feel same with 8.6 or 6.",2,1755481114.0,Christianity,4,1.0,False

It started after a 12 week period of hyposmia following a covid-19 infection. The first thing that made me think something was wrong was when I thought my cats' food was rotten, but I made my boyfriend smell it and he said it was completely normal. Soon after, coffee tasted and smelled absolutely disgusting, then chocolate, then fried foods, nuts, etc. Thankfully I have a relatively wide range of safe foods, and most ""wrong"" foods aren't bad enough to make me gag, so I still eat mostly normally and stay away from the worst things (listed above). 

Anyway, the past week or so I have been having some small improvements with increasing my range of foods. I like bread and strawberries again! I'm not sure if I'm just getting used to my ""new normal"" or I'm actually healing, but either way I'm happy to be less distressed.

Flew in and headed straight to Moorea Beach Club to see our Vegas ‚Äúfamily‚Äù. Crew is as solid as always. We tried to play catch up like rookies and a lengthy nap was in order.

We are Mandalay Bay homers so StripSteak was in order and never disappoints. Finally went to Libertine Social Club and was so good we went back the next night! Ribs are out of this world and make sure you get the bread, yes, the bread!

Took in Lenny Kravitz, first time in the Dolby and wow what a great arena! Lenny was awesome.

Mad Apple at NYNY was awesome! I never go into an event early and so glad security shooed me inside, the stage is a bar!!! I think if you have been to a cirque show before this one will surprise you with the comedy and atmosphere.

Matt Franco. Holy crap! The show was so good but it kinda creeped me out because it was so good. Great value show here.

The surprise of the trip was Carrot Top. This was our first ‚ÄúVegas‚Äù show and I laughed so damn hard. A master at his craft and current material. Can‚Äôt recommend this highly enough!

Don‚Äôt miss the filet tacos at Diablos while in the Luxor.

Craps kicked us in the teeth! Pulled off my marker and it went downhill from there. Had only 1 net positive session.

Sad last beer at airport and already working on next trips.

Stuff expensive, always is. We packed a cooler and our own coffee.

Venetian was packed on Tuesday night as was that end of the strip. ",15,1755480923.0,vegas,8,0.9,False

**First post:** [July 13 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1e2pzfy/i_need_to_confess_to_my_wife_that_i_let_things/)

My wife and I are long-distance. She works abroad. I take care of our sons (4 and 3) and do odd jobs. Originally we lived with her but our kids ended up put in a dangerous situation and I didn't want that to happen again. Quitting her job wasn't an option in her eyes so I moved to our home country with the kids while she stayed. She visits us a few times a year. I moved in with close family friends.

It was a hard and painful decision. I had a lot of resentment over my wife prioritizing her job over our family. But I love her. I couldn't imagine not being with her. I thought about divorce but we decided to try to work things out.

The other woman was my friend when we were little kids. After my mother died I left my hometown and moved in with my dad and didn't see that friend. But I stayed connected with some other people from that town throughout my life and when I moved back home with the kids I started visiting my hometown more. To see my mom's grave and visit my old neighbors. When I met my old friend again I was excited to see her, but I'm nostalgic for everything from my childhood, it started out innocent. I was just happy to have another connection to that part of my life. Anyway she has a son too who is 6, and so we ended up taking our kids to the park together while we had a coffee and caught up. It was innocent and I told my wife I'd reconnected with her and my wife was fine with it. She jokingly asked if she should be jealous but she didn't mean it. She trusted me. So I feel so terrible.

We met up a couple times a month from then on. I don't really know when it lost its innocence. But I realized I started becoming infatuated with her. We'd hug every time we met up and before we left and I would feel so wistful when she would hug me. She would start talking about how her ex mistreated her and her son and I felt so protective. She started making comments like, ""(My son) is so good with (your sons), it's like they are brothers!"" And I talked to her about some of the stuff that bothered me about my relationship with my wife and she sympathized.

I realized that I enjoyed the attention and I found myself entertaining fantasies that I was with her instead. I kept thinking about if I had never met my wife and had instead moved back home and reconnected with my old friend, and we'd somehow had our same kids only with each other, we both could have been happy and been spared so much pain. If I'm trying to be objective, she's a better match for me than my wife. She puts her kids first. She appreciates me for who I am. My wife does too but I feel like me and the kids are always an afterthought for her. Even when she's home and spending time with us she is always, always thinking about her job. My wife is a good person and she does good work. But her job traumatizes her and she was already tramautized before she started it. She started doing her job to cope with her past but she's also retraumatizing herself over and over. And my kids and I pay the price. I'm not trying to justify my actions I'm just trying to explain. My childhood friend was always complimenting me on my looks, how good of a dad I am, my physical strength. It's like she appreciated the unique things about me. And I feel like my wife loved me just because I was there for her. Like she would have loved anyone who loved her and I was just the only one who did. It wasn't always like that but that's how it started to eventually feel with my wife being so distracted by her job all the time. I didn't really notice it until I reconnected with my friend and noticed the contrast.

I should not have let things get that far I know. But at first it was just an occasional thought and I just brushed it off as intrusive thoughts and telling myself, yeah, everyone has inappropriate thoughts, but what matters is your actions. But I just let it go too far. In hindsight some of our ""friendly banter"" was really more like flirting and it was not appropriate. That's an action, not a thought.

Anyway today was a reality check. She said she wanted to talk to me about something serious without the kids there so I let my other friend who I live with baby-sit and met up with her. And she basically confronted me with the fact that we obviously have feelings for each other and said I should leave my wife for her.

But it was like immediately I realized the amount of bullshit I was feeding myself and her. I instantly felt so bad, I didn't deny having feelings but maybe I should have. She kept insisting I think it over and when she saw how upset I was she said she'd let me think it over then left. I should have told her, no, there is nothing to think over, I love my wife and I'm not leaving her. But I didn't say anything. That in itself is weighing on me.

I need to tell my wife. I know. I just don't even know where to begin. Next time she's coming home is October. I feel like this is the kind of thing to say face-to-face but I don't want to wait that long. And I don't want her to come all this way to have a nice time and ruin it. I could leave the kids with my friends and go visit her. But on top of the money issues and logistical issues even that thought makes me sick. I keep imagining her smiling and being delighted to see me and then how devastated she's going to be when I tell her. I can't stop thinking about her face. I feel sick. I don't want to tell her at all and just never see my childhood friend again (I'm also mad at myself for letting my stupid fantasies ruin a friendship and a precious memory but I know it would be wrong to keep seeing her and impossible to just be normal friends now) but I know honesty is the best policy. I owe it to her to be honest.

I just don't know what to do. I feel so wrong and stupid. I don't want to tell my friends. I think one

**Edits on the original post:**

EDIT: Okay these comments are overwhelming and I need to sleep. Tomorrow I'm going to talk to my friends about what's going on and (after being yelled at probably) see if they'll be able to watch my kids while I visit my wife and tell her what's going on. If not I can probably ask a few other people. If not then I'll just tell her over Zoom. I'm also going to text my childhood friend that I don't want to see her again and then block her. I'm not going to leave my wife. If she leaves me I'm going to stay single. I'm not going to date my ex-friend. I will always love my wife and I don't think it would be fair to anyone for me to date anyone else while I still love her.

To stop from having to answer the same questions over and over, my wife is an aid worker. She doesn't do it for the money. She does it because she believes God called her to do it. I do gig jobs and sometimes construction. I choose to work more flexibly and spend more time with my kids. I put my wife through college, I'm not freeloading off her (I am kind of freeloading off the friend I live with, I'll admit that. But we're all happy with this arrangement.) The reason I left with the kids is because we got carjacked at gunpoint. My wife changes location a lot so living somewhere safe but still closer to her isn't really an option. It's either travel with her officially through her organization, or stay put somewhere. I don't think my childhood friend originally intended to cheat with me, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

EDIT 2: Everyone telling me to get a stable job so my wife can come home, you misunderstand. You think my wife and I haven't spoken about this? She is never going to quit her job. She made that very clear. Her job is her priority. I promise you she's not doing it for the money. I'm not forcing her to do it by refusing to work more. If she said she would even consider quitting if I found a more stable job I'd do that in a heartbeat.

Anyway I talked stuff over with my friends. They were understanding. The plan is to fly over and see my wife next week ish, but we still have to make arrangements. I thought about contacting my wife's boss to see if we could do a surprise visit, but it seems like it would be so cruel to show up and surprise her and make her happy to see me only to break her heart. So instead I called my wife saying everyone is OK but I have something bad to tell her that she should hear in person and I'm going to fly out to see her. She said I should just tell her because otherwise she's going to worry about it the whole time. So I almost did. But then she said ""No, don't tell me. I want to see you."" So I didn't.of them would be really angry at me for almost cheating and the other might actually encourage me to leave my wife. I feel like I need someone to tell me what to do because I can't process.

[Second Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1eep4rj/update_i_confessed_to_my_wife_about_an_emotional/)**: July 28, 2024**

My last post is on my profile, the mod told me links aren't allowed

A lot of people asked me for an update, which I will but I have a couple of things to say first.

First, I wanted to thank everyone who commented CIVILLY, regardless of your opinion. I especially appreciated hearing from people who had been in a similar situation or in a similar situation to another person I mentioned. I wasn‚Äôt thinking very straight at the time and I don‚Äôt think I thanked everyone properly but it was very kind of you to take the time to share your perspective.

The other thing‚Ä¶ I should have said something at the time, but a lot of people bashed my wife and I didn‚Äôt defend her as much as I should have. So I‚Äôm gonna set the record straight now. First of all, people were saying she was cheating on me. But she would never, ever do that. She is honest and loyal, and a much better person than I am. Second, people were saying my wife is negligent and doesn‚Äôt care about me or our kids. This is also WRONG. She‚Äôs very loving. Yes, she is busy with her job. But she says she thinks about us every moment. And when she is home she spends as much time with me and the kids as she can. She DOES get distracted and think about things at work that stress her out, but that‚Äôs because she sees things that get to her. It‚Äôs not because she doesn‚Äôt care about us. She‚Äôs not like half the parents out there that ignore their kids because they‚Äôre distracted by their phone. People were also bashing me in a way that I think was kind of over the top but honestly, you can bash me, but don‚Äôt bash my wife. Me having problems in my relationship doesn‚Äôt mean she deserves to be bashed.

I actually showed the post to my best friend, and she pointed out that a lot of you were probably just being sexist. You attacked my wife and said she didn‚Äôt care about me or our kids because she doesn‚Äôt get to see us much. But my friend pointed out that there are a LOT of jobs that mostly men do that mean they don‚Äôt get to see the kids much, and NO ONE says that they don‚Äôt love their kids and need to quit. So for everyone who said my wife doesn‚Äôt love our kids: would you say the same to dads who are in the military, truck drivers, work on oil rigs? Would you say that they‚Äôre all definitely cheating on their wives? Or tell their wives that they should leave them? If not, you‚Äôre being sexist. And for everyone who told me to get a better job so my wife can come home, would you say that to a woman who is married to a guy who does one of those jobs? For everyone saying me and my wife shouldn‚Äôt be married or have kids because she‚Äôs an aid worker, do you think there shouldn‚Äôt be any aid workers? Or do you think no aid worker should be allowed to get married and have kids just because of their job? You realize a lot less people would be aid workers if it meant they couldn‚Äôt have a family right? You don‚Äôt make any sense.¬†

Anyway. I saw my wife and told her everything, and we actually had a nice visit.

She was glad to see me in spite of everything. And she insisted I not tell her anything bad until after she showed me something. Which was confusing to me, but I agreed. Anyway, it was a little waterfall. And it was beautiful. She said she visited the waterfall whenever she got a chance and it reminded her of me, and she wished she could show it to me every time. I nearly cried when she said that. I almost couldn‚Äôt even tell her after that, but I already told her I was going to tell her something bad so I had to. Anyway, we sat there by for a while until she said she was ready to hear my bad news.

So‚Ä¶ as much as it killed me, I told her everything that happened. She tried to be calm and understanding, but I could tell she was hurt. I almost wished she would have yelled and slapped me. But she just thanked me for being honest.

She asked what I was going to do, I said I wasn‚Äôt going to stay in touch with my former friend either way but I hoped she would forgive me and come home to us in October like she planned. She said I was already forgiven and asked me for more details about what exactly happened and my feelings, which I did my best to answer honestly. It was hard though. I could tell she was getting more and more upset. Eventually she just said ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù and we walked back to her base without really talking at all.¬†

That night we talked more. She knows it‚Äôs hard for me to live the way we do and she just asked me again if I was sure I still wanted to be with her. I told her I knew she wasn‚Äôt going to quit her job but I talked about how one of the hardest things is that even when she comes home, her mind is on her job and it‚Äôs hard to see how sad and stressed she always is. She said she‚Äôd bring it up in therapy and try to work on being present in the moment with her family. She kept pressing me on if there was anything else she could do better besides quit her job and I told her how I felt about how sometimes it seems like she only loves me because I love her, and I could be anyone. She cried, apologized, said it‚Äôs not true, and told me as many specific things she could think of that she loves about me. I did the same for her. She said she was glad we talked and glad I was willing to keep working on our marriage, because from the beginning when I told her I had something bad to tell her in person she just assumed I wanted a divorce. She said she‚Äôs always worrying I‚Äôm going to leave her but she‚Äôs grateful for every day I don‚Äôt. I promised her I don‚Äôt plan to and told her I worry the same thing sometimes. It was a really good conversation.

The other days, I went to her job site with her for a bit and helped out with a few things. The local kids were teasing my wife about me, which was adorable.¬†

Things aren‚Äôt perfect, but they‚Äôre going to be okay.¬†

Also, I know a lot of people said that my wife should leave me because what I did was as bad as a physical affair. And, confusingly, a lot of people said I did nothing wrong. I think it‚Äôs somewhere in between. I did something wrong but I did stop it before it got that far. And a lot of other people say I should divorce my wife. But I‚Äôm not divorcing her. She has her flaws but she‚Äôs also one of the best people I know. All of her flaws are because she‚Äôs been through things that I can‚Äôt even imagine. I chose to love her in spite of the things she can‚Äôt give me. I will always love her. I‚Äôm not someone who can stop loving someone. Even if we divorced I‚Äôd think about her and wonder if she was okay every single day. I can‚Äôt be in a relationship with another person even if I wanted to because I‚Äôd never be over her, it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to them. It‚Äôs my wife or no one for me.¬†

**Comments were largely negative towards OOP, his wife, and the friend who said the commenters were sexist, with a few exceptions.**

**Third**¬†[**post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fx7543/update_i_had_an_emotional_affair_a_few_months_ago/)**: Oct 5 2024**

Hi. This is sort of an update of my previous posts in this sub (you can see them on my profile, the sub won‚Äôt let me link them), but it‚Äôs also a lot of other stuff to get off my chest. I made a post here a while ago. It was about how I realized I was in an emotional affair with my old friend while my wife was working in the Phillippines. That issue is resolved; my wife forgave me, I haven‚Äôt spoken to my old friend at all anymore and I‚Äôm much more careful with my other female friends.¬†

However, some of the comments I got on my last posts have still been weighing on me. And my wife is home now, and she had a lot of big news that I want to get off my chest.

First, the good news is my wife is pregnant again. And I‚Äôm happy about it, in spite of everything. I know. Some people in my last post were asking if I was using protection to avoid bringing more kids into the world. And honestly‚Ä¶ no, we didn‚Äôt. And I didn‚Äôt want to admit that for obvious reasons. I don‚Äôt have any defense for that other than I‚Äôm stupid.¬†

The other major thing is that my wife probably has OCD.¬†

Basically, my wife realized she was late and probably pregnant a long time ago, but originally didn‚Äôt tell me or take a pregnancy test. She said it was like there were two different people in her head, and part of her was screaming to go get things figured out but the part of her that actually had control refused to do anything besides carry on as usual. She was too scared to take a pregnancy test and get proof that she was pregnant because she knew she wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to go on her next assignment because of zika virus. Basically it was a lot of screaming at herself to do something about it before she finally got the courage to tell her therapist what was going on and actually take the pregnancy test, so even though she got pregnant in July she hasn‚Äôt had any kind of care or anything yet.

Also, I guess she‚Äôd been hiding a lot of things from her therapist because she knew the therapist would make her take a break if she knew exactly what was going on in her head. So she wasn‚Äôt honest with the therapist about how she felt compelled to do this job, how she felt when she wasn‚Äôt doing it, et cetera. But she knew she needed to do right by her baby so she finally told the therapist about the pregnancy, how she was having such a hard time doing anything about it, and then everything else came out.

My wife described to me a bit more about how it feels to be in her head. It‚Äôs not just that she thinks God wants her to do her job. The way she said it basically, she constantly thinks about all the bad things happening in the world, everything terrible that she‚Äôs ever seen, every time she could have helped someone but didn‚Äôt even if she had a very good reason, and it makes her feel like she has to be working. She thought all these thoughts were God speaking to her, but she didn‚Äôt tell the therapist that because she thought ‚Äúshe wouldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù She told me when she finally told the therapist, she basically asked her if she thought God was loving, and if so, why God would want her to constantly be thinking about things that made her miserable.¬†

That question finally made my wife open to accepting that she might have a mental illness rather than just having God talking to her.¬†

She is home now, a couple of weeks earlier than she was supposed to come, so she can get prenatal care ASAP and a more in-depth mental health assessment. I guess her therapist just thinks she has OCD but can‚Äôt actually diagnose her or perscribe her medication or anything.

I feel so bad for her and like I failed, too. I feel like I should‚Äôve tried to dig with her more about what she was feeling. My wife was more open with me than the therapist about her thoughts and I feel like I knew something was wrong. But I assumed she was telling the therapist everything too, and that the therapist was helping to the best of her ability. And as much as I‚Äôm happy that I hope this means things are going to be better now, I know my wife feels awful and that makes me feel awful. Basically, she was really devout and religious growing up, but after some stuff happened to her she kind of lost her faith and felt like if God existed he didn‚Äôt approve of her. I met her around then and she was definitely in a very dark place for a while. She says that when she started having her thoughts about how she could fix the world it was really reassuring because she thought she was finally getting her faith back. So it‚Äôs been pretty crushing for her to not have that feeling anymore.

I‚Äôm hoping her therapist is able to help her with that as well. My wife doesn‚Äôt trust religious leaders anymore, so that makes it a lot harder for her to have to go through that. I believe in God, but I don‚Äôt believe the same things as my wife and I‚Äôm less devout than her, so I don‚Äôt always know what to say. I have told her I‚Äôm so sorry for what she‚Äôs been going through, and that I‚Äôm so proud of her for finally going to her therapist for help even though it was so hard. I told her I‚Äôm glad she was open with me and I hope she knows she can rely on me for anything she needs. And I told her I‚Äôm sure God knows how hard it was for her to get help and he‚Äôs proud of her too. That made her cry, I think in a good way.

Anyway, she‚Äôs been home a few days now and we‚Äôre just taking things one day at a time. Prenatal appointments coming up next week, but we‚Äôre still trying to figure out the OCD appointment stuff. So far we‚Äôve just been cherishing the family time as much as possible.¬†

The best news - my wife says when she‚Äôs done with maternity leave, instead of going back to work she might try to go back to school. She wants to get her master‚Äôs and learn another language or two, and she says part of the reason for that is that she would have more choices in her assignments and possibly be able to work with refugees here in the US instead of traveling all over. That way we could find somewhere to live permanently as a family. She says she‚Äôs not sure yet and she wants to spend some time figuring things out. But I am hopeful for the first time in a long time that we might be able to be happy together as a family someday.¬†

I am really just hoping everything turns out positively. I feel bad for being happy, since this is so hard on my wife, but I really hope it‚Äôll end up being a positive thing all around in the end.

We‚Äôve told my two closest friends (who we live with) about the new baby, but no one else yet (except Reddit strangers.) My best friend is almost as excited as me. She keeps coming to me talking about gender reveal party ideas. Like, randomly in the middle of talking about the election or whatever. We‚Äôre keeping it from the kids for just a while longer because she‚Äôs not very far along yet and if God forbid the baby doesn‚Äôt make it, we don‚Äôt want the kids to be upset. So I keep telling her to be a little more subtle and she keeps forgetting, but luckily the kids have no idea what she is talking about when she does that.

Anyway. That‚Äôs my big news. Someone asked me for an update and I wanted to clear the air and get some of this stuff off my chest anyway.

**\*\*NEW TO THIS SUB UPDATE\*\***

[April 5th 202](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jsijxc/my_27m_nearly_full_term_pregnant_wife_25f_wont/)5

I've posted here before about a major mistake I made while my wife was abroad working as an aid worker, I've also posted about how we recently found out she has OCD. Her form of OCD was that she thought God was constantly talking to her telling her to do things and reminding her of all the bad things that were happening in the world. Anyway since she found out she was pregnant she has been getting treatment for it, and for a while things were looking up. I don't mean to be selfish but for a while I felt like I could have my ""old wife"" back - she really wasn't really like this when we first got together. But it wasnt just for my sake I was hoping that with treatment she'd be happier herself and also be able to be there for our kids more.

However, ever since Trump took office my wife's mental health has taken a turn for the worst. She has always been completely devastated about Palestine, but when she was at her job her job was a distraction from it, and when she got home and didn't have the distraction it was rough but she was actively working on being able to cope. However, when Trump started cutting funding for aid programs, she found out that the organization she works for would be doing layoffs and she might not have a job to go back to she completely lost it. Her coworkers were giving her updates from the ground, there were a lot of rumors, for a few days she was basically just curled up in bed texting, reading the news, and panicking. I didn't know how to support her during that time, nothing I tried to do for her made a difference, she didn't want the kids to see her in that state so she just kept telling me to go spend time with them, she left her room only once during that time to go to therapy. But then the day after that she left the house without telling me to go protest by herself by walking along the main road holding a sign. Luckily she did tell my best friend where she was going, and my best friend went with her and texted me what was up. At first I was just glad she was feeling well enough to get out of bed.

However, now she does this more days a week than not, she spends more time doing this than she spends with our kids. I've gone with her a few times, my best friend goes with her a lot. Even if she wasn't protesting I'd be worried about her walking on that road, people drive really fast and aren't expecting pedestrians. However my other worry is that this is a very white and conservative area, a lot of people have guns, and my wife not only is out there protesting things that most people here agree with but she will actively shout at people who drive by with Trump stickers on their cars. There have been a few times when people will shout at her, a few people have pulled over to argue with her, and if that happens she doesn't try to deescalate or anything, she will scream back at them. She has asked a few times if our kids can come with her, I said no because I was afraid someone could hurt or threaten them, and she agreed not to take them. But when I mention that it would be just as horrible for our kids if they lost their mom and unborn brother because someone hurts HER, she brushes it off. No one has done anything physical yet, but there are some psychos out there and it only takes one.

She has also stopped doing therapy, stopped doing the workbooks her therapist gave her, and won't take her medication and didn't get her prescription refilled. She says that she doesn't think there is anything wrong with her, there is something wrong with all the people out there who AREN'T protesting. I asked her if she doesn't want to get better and be able to be happy and she says happiness isn't for her.

Another thing is that this is effecting our relationships with our neighbors. We were already ""odd"" in this area, we are not white and my wife is Muslim, we sometimes get looks and I've felt like I've had to ""earn"" acceptance from the neighbors. People will almost never be directly rude to us, but if I say ""My wife is a Muslim"" I can tell that what they hear is, ""My wife is a terrorist."" If I said ""My wife is a liberal Muslim"" that wouldn't go over much better. I've just kind of had to pretend I don't notice the reactions and keep being friendly until they decide my family is normal, I also try to always find a way to casually mention that my late mother was white and grew up in this area. However I can tell people are acting different around me now. A few people avoid me, some have awkwardly been like, ""So I saw your wife the other day"", I haven't been getting as much gig work, and worst of all, one of my son's best friend is no longer allowed to come over to our house. They outright told me, ""He can come over here, but I don't want him to go to your house anymore."" It felt like such a slap in the face, since I've babysat that kid so many times for FREE.

Since Israel broke the ceasefire it's been at its worst, she has been out there every day for hours. I feel so heartbroken for my kids, who don't understand, and for my wife, who is her own worst enemy. I can't force her to get help, but I have no idea what else to do. She's at least been keeping up with her prenatal appointments, and she's promised me that when our son is born she'll stop protesting, but I almost don't know if I believe her because it almost seems like she's not capable of that. How do I handle this?

**(Comments were mixed between supportive of OOP's wife and concerned for her. A few commenters suggested she had another mental illness besides OCD.)**

**Some comments of OOP's for context:**

In response to someone suggesting the wife might have shizophrenia and asking if she seemed like she was having conversations with an invisible person:

>No, she's never done that. I know what you're talking about, I see homeless people do that a lot and my wife never does it.

>The therapist explained it better than I could. But basically, people with schizophrenia who think they hear God are actually hearing a voice in their head. But my wife doesn't hear a voice. She has obsessive thoughts about bad things happening in the world, and feels like she has to fix it. This started happening to her suddenly, and her own explanation for it was that it was a message from God, because she didn't know any other explanation. But she doesn't actually hear a voice saying, ""(my wife's name), I want you to go protest on the street.""

In response to people saying he should be more supportive of his wife's protests:

>I am not trying to be flippant. I didn't want to make my post too long and I figured it should go without saying that obviously, what is happening in Palestine is horrific. I know it triggers my wife because of things she experienced in her own childhood and things her family has experienced. I'm not saying she shouldn't protest at all, but I wish she wouldn't do it in such a dangerous way and risk her own safety and the safety of our unborn son. I want her to be able to be happy and go to therapy so she can find a healthy way to deal with her emotions. Her emotions are totally valid but the way she's dealing with it doesn't help her.

>She is a good person and I love her so much, I really hope it doesn't lead to violence, but even without violence it's not a good road and I'd be worried someone could hit her ACCIDENTALLY, there are almost no pedestrians there and she doesn't just stay in one spot, she walks and crosses a lot of areas that a lot of cars are coming in and out of with no street lights. I also wish she would only hold a sign and not scream at people, because she might scream at the wrong person who would be crazy enough to attack her.

**Theme:** Delayed departure

* My train was scheduled to depart Seattle on Monday evening, but it ended up being delayed. Amtrak put me on a bus from Seattle to Spokane on Tuesday evening. A Subway sandwich box was provided for dinner.
* In Spokane, I hopped on the train and spent the night in a roomette.¬†

# Day 1 ‚Äì Wednesday, Aug 13, 2025

**Theme:** Arrival + Apgar to Logan Pass

* **7:38 a.m.** ‚Äì Arrived at Whitefish Amtrak Station and picked up a RAV4 from Budget rental car. The rental car man was friendly and helpful.¬†
* **Checked in to Grouse Mountain Lodge.** I was able to check in early since my reservation started the day before, and I called ahead to ensure they kept my room and didn‚Äôt mark me as a no-show.¬†
* Breakfast at Buffalo Cafe. Ordered coffee, biscuits and gravy, hash browns, and over-easy eggs. The flavor was there, but it needed more gravy.¬†
* **Drove to Apgar Village** (\~40 min). This area is *outside* the timed-entry restriction zone from the west side, so you can go anytime. I asked a park ranger for recommendations, and he suggested I hop on the shuttle bus and do a hike. I selected the Highline trail in Logan Pass. The shuttle allowed me to access Going-to-the-Sun Road without a timed vehicle entry reservation. \~15 min wait for the eastbound shuttle.
* **Arrived at Logan Pass and hiked the Highline Trail**:
   * Only hiked about 6 miles (3 miles one way, out and back) since I didn‚Äôt have time to do the whole thing. Still worth doing as the views of the pass are spectacular throughout the hike.
   * Took the shuttle back west toward Apgar Visitors Center. I saw a herd of rams along the Going to the Sun road, which was quite beautiful.¬†
* **Dinner**: Eddie‚Äôs Caf√© in Apgar Village. Ordered a huckleberry beer, buffalo burger with chips, and a slice of huckleberry pie. The food was decent. Beer was excellent.
* **Picked up a prepared sandwich from Safeway in Whitefish to have for lunch the next day**.
* **Returned to¬† Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish**
   * Hot tub, wind down, and sleep

# Day 2 ‚Äì Thursday, Aug 14, 2025

**Theme:** Called an audible from Many Glacier to Two Medicine and East Glacier¬†

* **Morning** ‚Äì Departed the hotel, used a vehicle entry reservation to take Going-to-the-Sun Road (West ‚Üí East), arriving at Many Glacier. Once I arrived, I was turned away because I did not have a hiker shuttle pass, which I was not aware I needed to enter Many Glacier. The NPS employee suggested heading down to Two Medicine and hiking down there
* **Lunch:** ate my Safeway sandwich at a picnic table on the shores of Two Medicine Lake
* **Afternoon Hike**:
   * **Aster Park Overlook**. The Overlook provides beautiful views of the Two Medicine area. On the way down, I stopped by Aster Falls. After Aster Falls, I saw a female moose! Back at the parking lot, I saw two mountain goats.¬†
* **East Glacier**:
   * Drove from Two Medicine to East Glacier
   * Explored the historic Glacier Park Lodge. A lady in the lobby was offering samples of a local liquor brand. I sampled an assortment of huckleberry-infused whisky, honey-infused whisky, and absinthe. She was friendly and knowledgeable, so I tipped her generously. The lounge next door served cocktails with the liquors I sampled, so I ordered a huckleberry mule at the bar and took it to the back porch. I enjoyed the mountain views and a cocktail while I planned where to eat for dinner and what to do the next day.¬†
   * **Dinner:** Serrano‚Äôs. Enchiladas and a huckleberry margarita were tasty. Bonus points for free chips and salsa.
* **Took US-2 back to Whitefish (\~2.5 hrs).**
* **Hot tub, wind down, sleep**

# Day 3 ‚Äì Friday, Aug 15, 2025

**Theme:** Many Glacier (take two)

* **Picked up a sandwich for lunch on the way to Many Glacier via US-2.**¬†
* **Parked and hopped on the Many Glacier hiker shuttle using a 10am-11am hiker shuttle pass**
* **Morning Hike**:
   * **Grinnell Glacier Trail** (12 miles RT, Hard, 6.5 hrs). On the way up, I saw a male moose, rams, mountain goats, and chipmunks
   * **Lunch**: had a sandwich at the upper lake and glacier. Gorgeous and worth the effort
   * On the way down, a mountain goat blocked the trail, backing up several hikers. We waited for several minutes, hoping it would leave, but it was happily munching on vegetation along the cliff. So, we had to force our way past, shooing it away as we carefully passed.¬†
* **Dinner**: Many Glacier Hotel dining room. Ordered a local hazy IPA, bison short ribs with mashed potatoes and carrots, and attempted to order a Powerade, which was on the menu, but they ran out
* The shuttle was extremely delayed (waited \~90 min). The crowd was quite restless and packed like sardines in the shuttle. The NPS needs to improve the shuttle system. Eventually, I got back to the car and returned to the hotel via Going-to-the-Sun Road.
* Hot tub, wind down, sleep

# Day 4 ‚Äì Saturday, Aug 16, 2025

**Theme:** Avalanche Lake and more train delays

* **Slept in til 9am as I was tuckered out at this point after several long days of adventuring. Checked out of the hotel.**¬†
* **Grabbed a Safeway sandwich, drove to Apgar Visitor Center, and hopped on the shuttle to the Avalanche area.**¬†¬†
* **Hike**:
   * **Avalanche Lake** (easy/moderate). Found a nice spot nestled within the trees on the far side of the lake. Ate my sandwich next to a curious blue jay that kept hopping around me and eating berries. Swam in the lake briefly. It was cold and invigorating. Accidentally went in with my earbud but if seems to have survived. Saw a deer on the way down.
* **Afternoon**: On the shuttle back to Apgar had a stimulating conversation with an artist on a month-long trip in pursuit of finding her next home. Coincidentally, her next stop was Sequim, WA, and she said she‚Äôd know when she found her next home based on a feeling. Discovered that my train back to Seattle was delayed until early Sunday morning, so I found a hotel for the night. Drove back to Whitefish
* **Dinner**: Abruzzo‚Äôs. The wild boar ragu and wine were excellent
* **Dessert and live music:** a food truck area near the restaurant had free live music and huckleberry ice cream, which was delicious. I enjoyed the ambiance, so I ordered a beer and stayed awhile listening to the music.
* **Evening**: got gas at Safeway, which was the lowest priced (other than Costco, which wasn‚Äôt worth the extra drive time), checked in to Apres hotel, hit the sauna, and slept

# Day 5 ‚Äì Sunday, Aug 17, 2025

* **6 am** ‚Äì Returned rental car at Budget.
* **7 a.m.** ‚Äì Departed Whitefish on Amtrak.
* **Took in the views from the observation car, had breakfast in the dining car, and relaxed in the roommette**¬†
* The train would go no further than Spokane since they were sending it back the other direction to catch up on delays, so they provided lunch and a bus back to Seattle

**TLDR**: The NPS needs to add more shuttles and drivers to the shuttle system to improve the experience for everyone involved. I would not travel by rail to GNP again because it is not reliable enough, and there is not enough redundancy for when things go wrong. However, GNP itself was beautiful and rugged. I would visit again for the spectacular hikes and wildlife. The highlights were my hike to Grinnell Glacier and a swim in Avalanche Lake, both of which were world-class outdoor experiences.

We see a cafeteria,we enter inside and see zealous being served some coffee and eating some donuts! He seems happy, ‚Äúhmp! This is amazing iron!‚Äù The cameraman zealous spoke to laughed wearing a chef hat he said ‚Äúyep! Being a knight just wasn't my thing,i tried but such a violent job just wasn't my thing!‚Äù Zealous spoke ‚Äúwhats with that anyway? Something bothered you?‚Äù Iron takes a deep breath before speaking ‚Äúi kept seeing peoples faces,people i never met before yet getting a weird feeling that i did meet them before,people have had paranoia and crime has risen and i couldnt be a royal knight and keep getting involved with those things,they were kinda disturbing,and i dint want to deal with that,being a chef just seemed more peaceful ya know?‚Äù.....silence fills the room as zealous smile is gone looking at iron blankly



Iron cameraman says ‚Äúhum you okay?‚Äù Zealous snaps out of it ‚Äúh-ho my bad i just-..anyhow i really appreciate the food you sell! You're amazing at this honestly,I'm just a bit scared of hearing that I guess..‚Äù iron gets an idea ‚Äúwell,you deserve to be able to make these yourself,I think you're a great kiddo! And you deserve to pay less for some donuts and coffee anyway!‚Äù zealous sighs ‚Äúfirst off im and adult. Second of all WHY WOULDNT I PAY FOR THESE? THESE TASTE AMAZING!‚Äù iron laughs ‚Äúi appreciate the compliment but just in case because this store is closed on weekends,would you like to see my recordings? I've made a lot of them so people can learn how to cook certain things! Not just donuts and dont worry i give those away for free‚Äù zealous eyes widen in excitement ‚ÄúID LOVE TO!!!‚Äù



Iron cameraman laughs ‚Äúalright‚Äù he gives him a few cassette tapes, a LOT of them zealous struggles to carry all ""aren't these too many???‚Äù Zealous said,‚Äùyou did ask me to give you all of them‚Äù iron cam responded then zealous smiles,eyes closed,his teeth visible ‚Äúfine! It'll marathon all of them anyway! You just wait!‚Äù iron chuckles ‚Äúgood work on it kiddo!‚Äù zealous steps out of the store and thankfully says ‚Äúthan yoouuu!!...AND I'M NOT A KIDDO!‚Äù



Iron watches him slowly go away then realises ‚Äúwait‚Ä¶HE ASKED TO PAY FOR SOMETHING TO CARRY BACK! GODDAMNIT!‚Äù



‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..



Zealous looks at his diary,flipping through his diary he sees drawings of all his friend and one of cami‚Ä¶.scratched off,the sound of the tv with the vhs tapes are heard,teaching about how to cook a hamburger,zealous is not paying attention to it sadly he's a bit too focused on the drawing,he sighs **‚Äúi shouldn't have scratched you off ho my god‚Ä¶.im avoiding you** [**so..im**](http://so..im) **never gonna get to see your face again‚Ä¶.yet i‚Ä¶.i took away the only way to see you smile without being scared of what will happen to you‚Ä¶‚Äù** he starts to tear up ‚Äúgosh,im an awful lover,bohohohoohh‚Ä¶..‚Äù he stays silent he lets the diary down and just lays on the sofa‚Ä¶empty and suddenly an explosion is heardscreams woke zealous off his bed and he got up,he saw a weird purple light coming from the city‚Ä¶suddenly without hesitating zealous exits the door as he sees an entire building fall down,he was sweating,scared,a million questions ran through his head,he's heard about crime suddenly appearing something that was new to this world,since it was only a thing he saw in the other universes yet something that never used to happen here,of course the royal knights would stop the crime but whatever is going on must be serious,and even tho scared,zealous for some reason cant stop moving his legs,because a part of him deep deep inside wonders‚Ä¶if the green lights and explosions he sees from afar‚Ä¶.are from his father

I've decided to use this timeline to focus on my abilities when it comes to mind control,as stated i still cant do it. ive tried with all sorts of animals,i cant even control an ant‚Ä¶so that changed my plans and i began a new method,ive started to instead use my smarts in other ways,over the few 2 years ive started to experiment on all sorts of animals,catching them from the wilderness and implanting cybernetics into them,a lot of them are sorta like undead cyborgs,some struggle to even move,ive made some chimeras and even some animals with cameras for heads,one of them for example was a bunny,i can see his vision through a tv,its been interesting,ive learned how to make laser weapons that i saw in all those universes,ive had lifetimes to get info and learn,so of course ive gotten smarter‚Ä¶but i need a human subject,ive tried speaking to zealous about any friends he's made,he didn't even talk or look at my direction‚Ä¶.but i noticed something,ive never seen him hang around with that green haired girl‚Ä¶what was her name? right..cami,ive decided that this is my chance to do something interesting..

zealous runs through the city,he sees knocked up trash cans,blood,weird cyborg,chimeras and camera bunnies running around,and yet that isn't the worst he sees,he saw a toilet and a cameraman's head smashed into one their corpses stuck together and dead on the ground,he looked bloody toys of kids from a destroyed building and hands sticking out of some of the rubble,zealous hyperventilates scared he remembers how he had to look at the dead corpse of juqulz and the king back then‚Ä¶he hopes he PRAYS its not what he thinks it is‚Ä¶yet he hears someone speak behind him ¬®thats where youve been huh?¬® zealous turns‚Ä¶and sees cami,her eyes were black and her pupils were green yet one part of her head was bloody and had a camera sticking out,there was some wings behind her,in fact her whole body besides the head was purely mechanical,one of her arms were a green laser cannon,and the other one was holding a green spear,armour plates surrounded that arm,she slowly floated up some wing coming out of those wings on her

  
zealous,dint cry,he dint scream,his eyes tho were wide,and his pupils were white from the shock,he was scared,he was crying,yet not a single sound,like this has happened so many times he cant even have a reaction to these sort of things anymore,and then a kick slams him to the ground as a spear stabs his shoulder,yet not a single scream of pain but his eyes say everything,cami was stepping on his chest,holding the spear her eyes close to him‚Ä¶she was emotionless too,more even and the agent was confused at this ¬®i expected you to not fight back..but your reaction,are you really that much of a push over? cant believe youd get used to this,after all you used to always act the same around these people even when your life repeated over and over,you still loved to be around them,has something changed? or have you grown accostumed to this?¬® mike stood besides the agent as he turns to him as he proceeds to speak ¬®right‚Ä¶i forgot my notes¬®

  
\[timeline number 4 entry number 3\]



ive turned cami into a mindless cyborg,she uses those type of weapons that for example,for now she shows no emotion but considering what ive seen in other universes its only a matter of time before she grows a personality and tries to fight back against me,ive decided to test her weapons instead on this place,it seems like the most reasonable outcome anyway since i can always reset to get rid of the consequences anyway.

  
agent speaks ¬®there,now as for you zealous,im only gonna hurt you,but i could never kill you,so just stay there,itll have cami bandage your shoulder after im done.¬®he adjusts his glasses and suddenly‚Ä¶.two blue lasers hit cami dead on taking her off zealous and letting go of her weapon,still stuck on zealous's shoulder,he's wondering who saved him and he sees him,iron!!! with his hands out he looks at zealous ¬®ZEALOUS! WHAT IS YOUR FATHER DOING?¬®the agent takes a deep breath holding his head ¬®thats none of your business¬® suddenly cami comes out of some rubble and quickly punches iron cam who blocks the hit makes him back off the strength of the punch dulted his arms a bit he tries to retaliate with his laser cannons on his hands but suddenly cami shoots out some lasers from her eyes shooting iron into a building,meanwhile zealouses grabs the spear on his shoulder and he struggles,sobbing and slowly pulls it out,the spear falls on the ground blood coming out of his shoulder as zealous for once actually makes a sound from the pain and he looks,agent x is staring at him from afar‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and slowly that dull look on his face changes to a smile and zealous gets scared‚Ä¶suddenly iron comes out of the rubble and in the air the two robots begin to fight,despite being way better at fighting camis weaponry is overwhelming him as she has a plasma shield and keeps slaming him into places with it,fire and lightning spreaded on his armour and as cami shoots her laser eyes and he shoots his laser cannons,he sees,agent xs smile,and realises something‚Ä¶confused but not wanting him to get away with this he gets out of the beam clash something agent x dint expect and mike pushes him out of the way as iron crashes into the ground destroying it

  
several notes fall everywhere¬† and as iron cam slowly gets up cami straights up slam dunks on him,wires stick out of iron cams head and as he got up cami begins to punch him creating cracks in his armour until she digs one of her hands on his chest and straights up pierces through him pulling out wires,however shes quickly shot by a laser from iron cams core burning her face and leaving blood on it as the laser quckly pushes her away,he quickly falls to the ground from the injuries and uses his hand to keep himself up,blood and oil come out of his injuries and he notices some notes,he grabs them and begins to read until his eye widens,realising whats going on

  
cami lands besides agent x who slowly got up and rubs the dirt off his suit,mike gets up by himself scared and shaking as agent x looks at cami he speaks to her ¬®maybe this isnt enough,hmmm¬®he looks at a plane and zealous speaks for once ¬®DAD! PLEASE DONT!!!¬®agent x slowly turns to him ¬®sorry,too late to speak up like always,cami‚Ä¶**shut it down**¬®she points her laser cannon towards it and it slowly charges up however someone¬† grabs her arm and changes her direction,making her shoot at a car instead destroying it completely,suddenly her head turns around unlike the rest of her body and shoots out her lasers straight into his face making him let go as her body turns around as well and shoots him dead on with her laser cannon however iron tanks it despite his head being fucked up from the attack and gets close,before cami can pull out her shield he grabs the iron plate and destroys it before shooting her down with his core destroying the ground agent x is surprised,cami is very damaged her laser cannon is gone and iron points his laser hands at her and looks at agent x ¬®what did you do to her?¬® agent x smiles and raises his hand,his palm out ¬®none of your business¬®he says and closes it,green electricity appears as suddenly a giant building appears from the sky and falls ontop of iron,the ensuing collision creates a shockwave that pushes zealous to the ground yet again,agent x thinks ¬®yeah,im done,mike get in were going away out of this mess¬®they begin to walk towards cami as zealous sees mike staring at him‚Ä¶.a tear from his eye as agent x pulls out a note and mike turns into a white bright light before going into the note

  
zealous struggles to get up and uses camis spear as support and agent x smiles ¬®im gonna guarantee she stays this way,she could be very useful after all¬®zealous screamsared screams tears in his eyes **‚ÄúNO PLEASE,I DINT EVEN TALK TO HER THIS TIME YOU CANT DO THIS TO ME!!!!‚Äù** he falls immediately to the ground when he tried to walk,and for a moment he wants to give up,but then he hears a voice and he turns‚Ä¶its iron still in the rubble but trying to get our yet unable to he speaks **‚Äúhow many times HAS HE DONE THIS TO YOU? Whoever that man is,hes not your father,he stopped being one a long time ago,you're the only one who can remember the timelines,if theres anyone that can make a change,its you and if you wait for something to change nothings gonna happen unless you have the bravery to do it yourself SO PLEASE,GET UP** ***AND FIGHT BACK ALREADYYYYY‚Äù***¬†

  
We see zealous feet struggling to push against the ground until suddenly some blue electricity surrounds it,zealous eyes go from a scared look slowly to one of anger,as his black eyes turn blue,agent x turns around slowly distracted by something and suddenly **HE GETS PIERCED BY CAMIS SPEAR**,agent x's concerned look turns into a smile as he sees the look of pure anger coming from zealous,there was no tears in his face,instead there were veins of pure anger on them,and his eyes looked at him with rage

  
Agent x smiles and speaks ‚Äúfor the first time,i can say im proud of you‚Äùsuddenly A PIECE OF ROCK HITS ZEALOUS IN THE FACE,blood in his cheek as he slowly got up,a growl of anger is heard yet agent x doesnt care,he slowly approaches,pulls the spear out of his chest¬† and with the blunt side smacks zealous right in the face into a wall,small injuries on his forehead,as blood started to come out and agent x got closer to cami ‚Äúthis is your one chance to live with a version of her who will always remember you,yet you waste it like an idiot,not suprised you never made a single invention in those past 80 years‚Äù suddenly‚Ä¶.zealous opens his hand reaching for cami and yet‚Ä¶.a button appears,a blue one instead of a green one and agent x is shocked as he sees‚Ä¶..yet he smiles as well,sweat on his face

  
\[Timeline number 4 entry number 4\]



Ive just seen it,my son has the same abilities i have,this means a lot ***the opportunities are endless***

  
Zealous presses the button

  
and now‚Ä¶theyre standing in an empty but not destroyed city zealous slowly gets up and agent smiles ‚Äúwhat are you gonna do now?‚Äù Zealous angered looks at his shoulder



No more wounds



And he speaks to agent x ‚Äú***im gonna kill you.***‚Äù

1mt8krr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costa/comments/1mt8krr/do_closes_need_to_be_complicated/,Do Closes need to be complicated?,"Recently started at my second Costa, now as a supervisor (Franchise, so just a BM for less pay). I have started to be put in charge of closes. I **HATE** closes because I end up jumping the gun and then getting pissed off that customers have sat on my freshly clean tables and floor.

My store is known for shutting ridiculously early, I (and I am ashamed) shut my store 20 minutes early because I was stressed out, but I profusely apologised and handed out lots of ice waters and our too-good-to-go pastries to make up for it, I had cleaned the floor over an hour early and overwhelmed myself with trying to get it done. 

I've decided that I want to try and really nail this and prevent stressing myself out, I've read some advice to start from the cake section and work back down to the coffee machine, which I think is solid advice. 

I've also thought about not doing the floor until either right before close, or just after as it only takes me 10-15 minutes maximum to wipe, sweep and mop the whole floor (small unit) and it can be done while the BM (if it's not me) is cashing up?

How do you guys close? what makes it easier for you?",3,1755480400.0,Costa,0,1.0,False
1mt8kap,https://i.redd.it/nbnoyu6miojf1.jpeg,"I just thought this was funny, so I decided to share.","A bulk goods trade caravan came in and I traded with them.  But just as I traded, one of them, Fabio, made a backhanded comment to Lev, who proceeded to fight Fabio, a hussar.  Just as I'm trying to haul my purchase, Fabio dies.  He was murdered by Lev.

  
""Wow"", I think.  That's a rather extreme ending to a mere blunt observation.

  
Then, the Mechhive shows up with a breacher raid.  The traders are right in the way.  I take the opportunity to draft all adults and try to flank the mechs as they are engaged with the traders, who were in their warpath.   The strategy works!  Unfortunately for the traders, there were only two survivors: Bishop and Leblanc.  Apparently, Leblanc had to loudly make an insulting remark about Bishop's clothes, which drove him into a rage.

1mt8k1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialRealEstate/comments/1mt8k1t/ask_me_anything_i_left_retail_commercial/,Ask Me Anything: I left retail commercial brokerage to start a development company.,"Hi all. I started in commercial brokerage in 2015 at one of the national firms. I left this brokerage in 2021 to start a development company and a small boutique brokerage. Since 2021, our brokerage arm has recruited two other teams and opened 2 additional small offices. On the development side, we‚Äôve completed and sold one project (national drive-thru coffee user), we‚Äôre entitled ready to pull permits on two other projects (one is a 2 tenant drive-thru coffee + express wash and the other is 3 tenant deal w/ a drive-thru QSR + express wash + pad sale to a cannabis user). Lastly we‚Äôre 3 months away from entitlement on a 30 acre grocery anchored site. On the 30 acre project, we‚Äôre 4 years into entitlement, 6th submittal to the municipality and about 2MM in soft costs to date which includes environmental (mitigation property purchase). We‚Äôre currently negotiating to open escrow two other grocery anchored sites, one is 18 acres and the other is +\-30 acres. 

 I‚Äôm giving you these details is for two reasons:

1) I want you to have context if there are any questions you‚Äôd like to ask me.

2) Because generally speaking, I‚Äôd encourage all brokers to make the switch if being a broker isn‚Äôt their calling.

Feel free to ask away. 

Best,
