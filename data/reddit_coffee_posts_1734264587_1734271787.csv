The Paris Climate goals are dead. Scientists are reasonably certain that [2024 will end as the **warmest year on record**](https://phys.org/news/2024-12-warmest-november-earth-hottest-year.html), breaking an earlier record set by 2023. We have [felt more than 12 months](https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/12/09/2024-will-be-the-hottest-year-on-record-and-the-first-year-above-15c-scientists-confirm) of at least 1.5 °C warming. And AI [is being used](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad91ca) to predict temperature increases, and it’s not optimistic about our situation. 26 of its 34 assessed locations are predicted to have hit **3 °C warming by 2060**. So it goes.

NOAA released its [**2024 Arctic Report Card**](https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/)—and the [full 116-page document](https://arctic.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ArcticReportCard_full_report2024.pdf) is not optimistic—but it is quite thorough, and features some useful graphics. 

>“**Arctic annual surface air temperatures ranked second warmest** since 1900….The last nine years are the nine warmest on record in the Arctic. Summer 2024 across the Arctic was the wettest on record….The Arctic remains a **consistent methane source**….Alaskan permafrost temperatures were the second warmest on record….The increase in Arctic (60-90° N) surface air temperature continues to exceed that for the planet as a whole (90° S-90° N), a phenomenon termed **Arctic Amplification**….Sea ice extent in September 2024 was the 6th lowest in the satellite record….” -excerpts from the report’s headlines

In the UK, [**Storm Darragh** laid waste](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/storm-darragh-leaves-uk-s-biggest-solar-farm-in-pieces/ss-AA1vA2ul) to the country’s largest solar farm. At least [ten people were killed](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/10/deadly-landslides-flash-floods-hit-indonesias-java-island) by **flooding in Indonesia**. A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54831-9) in *Nature Communications* analyzed permafrost across Europe, and determined that “Substantial permafrost warming occurred at cold and ice-poor bedrock sites at high elevations and latitudes, at rates comparable to surface air temperature increase.” Some locations 10m deep registered a warming of more than 1 °C over the last decade. In contrast to many non-permafrost areas which see their warming predominantly in summer & autumn, most **permafrost sites experience their largest average warming during the winter**.

A [report](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-extinction/article/this-is-the-way-the-world-ends-not-with-a-bang-but-a-whimper-estimating-the-number-and-ongoing-rate-of-extinctions-of-australian-nonmarine-invertebrates/D0DCAA03EBA7ACC25F98F7BF5D87A2A6) on **biodiversity loss in Australia** claims that three species of insects & invertebrates go extinct Down Under every week. About two thirds of these are “**ghost extinctions**” in which species died off before they could be named & studied. “Our analysis provides a warning of the likely continuing and escalating high rates of looming extinctions. We predict that 39-148 Australian endemic non-marine invertebrate species will become extinct in 2024…this **rate of extinction will increase**.” Meanwhile, the U.S. government [added monarch butterflies](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/10/monarch-butterflies-threatened-species-list) to the threatened species list. [So it goes](https://aeon.co/essays/so-it-goes-and-goes-and-goes-on-vonneguts-death-mantra). 

Mostly because of rising Indian and Chinese demand, [**coal electricity production** hit a record high](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/World-Coal-Demand-and-Exports-Set-for-New-Record-Highs-in-2024.html) in 2024, with 2% more power forecast to be generated, when compared with 2023. Coal emissions are projected to reach record highs this year as well, as seen with [**crippling levels of smog**](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02711-9/fulltext) in India & Pakistan. Scientists say that some of Slovenia’s air pollution is [due to **wood burning**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/13/wood-heating-could-be-worse-than-thought-for-rural-air-study-suggests) for heat in the winter, a practice many locals believe to be harmless. San Francisco [had its first tornado warning](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/14/us/san-francisco-tornado-warning/index.html) ever on Saturday. 

The U.S. government [is approving the sale](https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/biden-administration-includes-restrictions-in-arctic-refuge-oil-lease-sale/) of 400,000 acres (to oil speculators) in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; the tracts will be sold on 9 January 2025. Meanwhile, [a **new oil tract**](https://archive.ph/SkcrQ) was discovered in Norway’s bit of the Arctic Sea, just as [Arctic Sea ice hit a new daily low](https://x.com/EliotJacobson/status/1866948757813858357) on Tuesday.

45,000+ people [evacuated part of the Philippines](https://news.az/news/over-45-000-evacuated-as-kanlaon-volcano-eruption-threatens-philippine-villages) to escape a **volcanic eruption**. Canada’s far north airstrips [are being examined](https://nunatsiaq.com/stories/article/thawing-permafrost-threatens-runways-in-the-north-senate-report/) to see how **permafrost melt** may impact their integrity. Lots of [new heat records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1866724597770621038) reportedly were set in Indonesia, where [fishermen venture farther and further out](https://www.context.news/climate-risks/as-marine-heatwaves-intensify-balis-fishers-hunt-far-and-wide) in the quest to extract whatever fish they can. 

In Sicily, the [**Water Wars continue**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/13/the-water-war-how-drought-threatens-survival-of-sicilys-towns) as Drought intensifies. Zimbabwe’s Drought is [expected to continue](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/zimbabwe-risk-another-dry-season-after-el-nino-drought-says-wfp-2024-12-12/). New [heat in Oceania](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1867502222495690899) and in [the Caribbean](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1867747507771773264). Overall daily surface temperatures [are experiencing a record streak](https://x.com/LeonSimons8/status/1867257967344779646) of above-average temperatures. 

——————————

Welcome to the “[**Plastisphere**](https://phys.org/news/2024-12-unveiling-antarctic-plastisphere-unique-potentially.html),” a term which refers to microscopic organisms living on plastic waste—here, those left in the Antarctic. Scientists are concerned about previously untouched regions like Antarctica being contaminated with bacteria & plastics. So it goes. 

A [study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL110359) in *Geophysical Research Letters* determined that **over 75% of coastal aquifers will experience** [**saltwater intrusion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltwater_intrusion) by 2100, as sea levels rise, coastlines become eroded, and saltwater creeps up ocean-facing rivers. 

An Australian official admitted that [hundreds of viral samples went missing](https://www.newsweek.com/deadly-virus-missing-laboratory-australia-hantavirus-lyssavirus-hendravirus-1997610) from a lab in 2021, unbeknownst to the scientists for another two years. Central & South America [reported **record dengue fever cases**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czendjlx849o) this year—12.6M+ cases and 7,700+ deaths.  

Wild geese with bird flu [are migrating into Kansas](https://www.kansas.com/news/state/article296815989.html). It seems as if we keep [retreading the old talking points](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bird-flu-pandemic-experts_l_67584c7ae4b0f51b80bdccf5): **not human transmissible yet**, it’s probably not making the jump, and you aren’t a raw milk-drinking farm worker. Yet [**bird flu spreads**](https://archive.ph/zq7Nx) in [animals](https://archive.ph/v9hso) foreign & domestic, free & slave alike. [Nobody would be surprised](https://www.science.org/content/article/why-hasn-t-bird-flu-pandemic-started) if H5 took off as a global pandemic worse than COVID. And yet little is done because the problem seems impossibly unmanageable—but then it becomes even more unmanageable. So it goes.

Researchers [are taking note](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/when-long-covid-makes-you-extra-thirsty) of a relatively recent Long COVID symptom: “excessive **thirst**.”  Scientists are [linking muscle fatigue with neuroinflammation](https://theconversation.com/brain-inflammation-may-be-the-reason-behind-muscle-fatigue-after-infection-and-injury-239817), which is problematic also because **COVID can linger in our organs**, like the brain, for months (years?). Scientists are also [grappling with](https://archive.ph/MGRQ4) a smorgasbord of COVID-related digestive issues and potential treatments.

**Coffee prices** [hit record highs](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36pgrrjllyo), as a result of a [months-long Drought](https://archive.ph/SqD38) in Brazil. Food prices [are said](https://www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/global-food-prices-soar-to-19-month-high-in-november-un) to have reached 19-month highs generally. Global **government** [**debt has hit record highs**](https://archive.ph/ioeqn), and [political/social friction](https://www.politico.eu/article/frances-credit-rating-lowered-by-moodys/) is obstructing reform. [U.S. debt problems grow](https://think.ing.com/articles/us-bond-market-on-the-precipice-when-it-comes-to-funding-the-deficit/) over government financial imperatives. **Gold & silver** meanwhile [sit near record highs](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/opendata/precious-metals-surge-to-all-time-highs). 

Market analysts say that “[**resource nationalism**](https://archive.ph/qyLEg)” is rising worldwide as rival power blocs scramble to secure energy & minerals. Moldova [declared a **preemptive state of emergency**](https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/news/moldova-declares-state-of-emergency-as-risk-of-russian-gas-cutoff-looms/) in preparation for an expected LNG freezeout from Russia starting on New Year’s Day. Europe’s Central Bank [lowered interest rates](https://archive.ph/Q3s91) again. New data indicate that [the UK economy sank](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/economy-gdp-economy-recession-reeves-b2663790.html) in October—by 0.1%. 

The WHO’s 320-page annual [**Global Malaria** Report](https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2024) 2024 was published, and it says **2023 was the fifth year of consecutively rising malaria cases**—although it only includes data from 83 states. This is an excellent resource for the state of malaria worldwide, although it was too big for me to skim in its entirety. So it goes.

>“in 2023, the number of malaria cases was estimated at 263 million, with an incidence of 60.4 cases per 1000 population at risk. This is an increase of 11 million cases from the previous year…. The top five countries carrying the heaviest estimated burden of malaria cases in 2023 were **Nigeria** (26%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (13%), Uganda (5%), Ethiopia (4%) and Mozambique (4%)....The intersection of conflict and violence, natural disasters, malnutrition and malaria transmission creates a compounded public health challenge in malaria endemic regions. Environmental and political changes can play a role in the resurgence of malaria….In Africa, where **95.4% of all estimated malaria cases were reported, IDPs accounted for 46% of all global displacements**, with 93% of them displaced due to conflict and violence in the region….In 2023, natural disasters contributed to 10.9% of all displacements.” -excerpts

——————————

In Haiti, a gang leader reportedly [ordered the killing](https://archive.ph/llHRl) of scores of senior citizens, over claims that some of them were using voodoo to make the gangster’s son sick. [Over **180+ people were killed**](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/09/americas/haiti-gang-massacre-voodoo-intl-latam/index.html), including 50+ killed by machetes and knives. The sick boy died from his mystery illness. So it goes.

Chinese vessels [gather around Taiwan](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/9/taiwan-raises-alert-to-high-amid-presence-of-chinese-warships) in another hybrid shaping operation, their largest unannounced drill to date. ACLED [released its **Conflict Watchlist**](https://acleddata.com/conflict-watchlist-2025/), a collection of reports about some of the most fragile geopolitical situations—and what might come next. They concluded that [**2024 was the most deadly**](https://archive.ph/Svul8) year globally in over 5 years. Roughly 233,000 people were slain in a conflict (so far) in 2024, according to their count—up from 179,000 last year. So it goes.

The problem of Conflict has, for risk assessors & businesspeople, [eclipsed **extreme weather**](https://www.thehrdirector.com/business-news/business/global-political-instability-overtakes-extreme-weather-biggest-risk-concern/) as the top concern. 

A mystery attacker [killed 3 with a bomb](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp5jxzl9eo) at a festival in northern Thailand. In the United States, concerns over [swarms of **mystery drones**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62785697v0o) grow. In a moment of good news, Ethiopia and Somalia [reconciled their feud](https://www.dw.com/en/ethiopia-somalia-reach-compromise-to-end-feud-turkey-says/a-71029613), forestalling a regional crisis developing since January. Back to the bad news: in Mozambique, [**post-election protests continue**](https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20241210-mozambique-violence-fuelled-by-historical-grievances-and-civil-war-politics). India’s [farmers are mobilizing a protest](https://www.dw.com/en/indias-farmer-protests-are-on-the-move-again/a-71013831) over undelivered government incentives that Modi promised to farmers. In South Korea, [a **second impeachment attempt** was launched](https://www.npr.org/2024/12/14/nx-s1-5228633/south-korea-parliament-impeach-president-yoon-suk-yeol), successfully; now the Constitutional Court gets involved… 

Rumors [are coming out](https://x.com/ScharoMaroof/status/1867526240682365189) of a firefight between Iraq’s military and its federal police agency. In Mexico, a [judge was shot dead](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9135j89do) outside a courthouse. Georgia’s [political situation unravels](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygejxej28o) further after the appointment of a pro-Russian president. One ethnic army in Myanmar has, for the first time, [taken all the territory](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg324den6po) lining the border with Bangladesh, denying the central government access across. Reports indicate that a **long, violent siege ended** when the last junta forces in a border town surrendered. In Afghanistan, [**famine** grows](https://archive.ph/FHMzy) amid a global struggle to secure limited humanitarian financing. 

Some [20,000 Sudanese refugees crossed](https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/unhcr-raises-alarm-surge-new-arrivals-south-sudan) into South Sudan last week. [**Barrel bombs** dropped](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wlp15400eo) by Sudan’s government army at a Darfur market [killed 100+ people](https://archive.ph/9miJ7), with hundreds more wounded. 20+ were slain by RSF **artillery** the following day. Some [organizations call the Sudan War](https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20241211-sudan-war-sparks-biggest-humanitarian-crisis-ever-recorded-irc) the “biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded” while [some diplomatic officials say](https://archive.ph/m5bhx) that Sudan is hurtling towards *de facto* partition, or totally falling apart into state failure. [Reports are emerging](https://archive.ph/SQ5GM) which claim that the United Arab Emirates is hiring **Colombian mercenaries** to support the insurgent RSF forces. So it goes.

Russian [& North Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/15/ukraine-war-briefing-north-korean-troops-join-russian-assaults-in-significant-numbers-kyiv-says) forces [made small gains](https://www.newsweek.com/north-korean-troops-seize-first-village-ukraine-battle-kursk-region-reports-2000359) in Russia’s Kursk oblast, pushing Ukrainian fighters out of a couple villages. A Russian [strike killed 8](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8g9pzn8z0o) in Zaporizhzhia. A Ukrainian colonel [announced](https://kyivindependent.com/2-000-servicemen-poisoned-3-dead-from-russian-chemical-weapons-since-start-of-war-ukrainian-colonel-says/) that 2,000+ Ukrainian soldiers have been hospitalized from chemical attacks since the full-scale invasion began. Russians [advance further](https://archive.ph/dehz2) towards the city of Pokrovsk, a logistical base in Donetsk, with **high casualties on both sides**. 

President Zelenskyy has [revealed the total number of Ukrainian casualties](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-announces-its-total-military-casualties-first-time/) since February 2022—whether you believe them is up to you. He claims **43,000** soldiers have been killed, with 370,000 wounded. Together, the 413,000+ represent about 1% of Ukraine’s pre-War population, or 2% of the male population. Europe & Nato [are bracing for a bigger War](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/13/europe-must-adopt-wartime-mindset-to-stop-putin-says-nato-chief) with Russia—faster than expected. So it goes.

A [26-page report](https://www.warchild.org.uk/our-work/policies-and-reports/needs-study-impact-war-gaza-children-vulnerabilities-and-families) on children in Gaza paints a disastrous picture: “**96% of children feel death is imminent**…79% suffer from nightmares…73% of children exhibit symptoms of aggression…49% of children wish to die because of the war.” More than 80% of adults in Gaza are unemployed. [Several Israeli strikes last week](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk0x64ll8jo) killed a dozen aid workers—and, in another attack, 15 at a refugee camp. “Gaza now has [the highest number of **child amputees** per capita anywhere in the world](https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/12/1158176)” according to a UN refugee official. A coincidence that [Gaza’s last bone surgeon died](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyv3m71g1q0o) a few days ago, killed by IDF tankfire. So it goes.

[Stories are emerging](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/09/inside-sednaya-torture-prison-syria-assad) from Syria, where its prisoners [have been liberated](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4784vn4jdo), and **long-suffering torture** victims speak out. Meanwhile, [Russians reconsider](https://www.twz.com/air/russian-forces-appear-to-be-pulling-out-of-prized-syrian-air-base) their positions in Syria. [Israeli forces move](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx921zreweo) against Syrian military assets. Assad himself is [allegedly](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp31yj8wqqno) hiding in Russia. The population [is rejoicing](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241213-g7-to-meet-on-syria-government-pledges-rule-of-law). Time will tell if their optimism is more than momentary. A [**provisional government is forming**](https://www.euronews.com/2024/12/10/syrias-departing-government-will-transfer-power-until-march-says-head-of-interim-cabinet) and [this may be](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/syria-assad-future-1.7405335) a rare example of a failed state bouncing back after Collapse. Or [maybe not](https://abcnews.go.com/International/syria-post-assad-power-vacuum-poses-unexpected-problems/story?id=116592032).

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1het59c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1het59c/handmade_crafts_on_etsy/,Handmade Crafts on Etsy,"So, you're diving into the wonderful, sometimes chaotic world of crafting, are you? Excellent choice! Crafting is like therapy with glitter—so therapeutic, and the glitter is a bonus! Let's chat about some trending craft ideas, how to snag materials on a budget, and whip up some sweet marketing strategies for your Etsy shop.

First up, let’s tackle the trendiest craft ideas. Personalized mugs are all the rage right now, and honestly, who doesn’t love a one-of-a-kind coffee vessel? You can get creative with funky designs, quirky phrases, or meaningful quotes. Think about using vinyl decals or hand lettering—it's like throwing a tiny party on a handle! Besides mugs, macramé wall hangings are making a comeback—it’s like weaving your own art while simultaneously channeling your inner '70s bohemian. And don’t sleep on custom candles. Everyone loves a good scent, especially when it’s paired with a lovely label or a pun that makes you chuckle while you extinguish it.

Now, onto sourcing materials affordably. The first rule here is to embrace your inner detective. Check out local thrift stores for hidden gems—you’d be surprised what you can find! Old mugs? Yes, please! Fabric scraps? A big ol’ yes! And don’t forget about online marketplaces and bulk buying. Websites like AliExpress or even local Facebook groups often have deals that can make your wallet sing. You could also swap materials with friends—nothing says community like turning your friends' junk into craft treasure! 

Regarding marketing strategies for your Etsy shop, you’ll want to think about how to make your products irresistible. First, ensure your shop is visually appealing. Use bright, clear photos—make those mugs glisten like they just came out of a pottery kiln. Write descriptions that are not just informative but tell a story. Invite your audience into your crafting world—how did you get inspired to create that particular piece? What’s the journey behind it? And let’s not forget social media. Share behind-the-scenes snippets of your process, maybe even a few bloopers—because nothing wins over hearts like authenticity. Create engaging content—polls, fun facts, maybe even a hilarious GIF about the woes of crafting. 

Finally, sprinkle in some community elements. Join local crafts fairs—not just for the sales but for the connections! Collaborate with other local artisans; maybe host a pop-up shop or joint workshop. This builds relationships and expands your reach because, let’s be honest, our creative journeys are so much richer when shared with others.

Remember, crafting is about joy and connection—create, share, and never stop experimenting. You might just spark a new trend!",1,1734271256.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

Episode 19: Niagara Brawls

""Last time, on Total Drama World Tour. The gang nearly turned into Swedish meatball pops! But our competition heated way up when Heather tried to keep up her own lies in order not to make Sky suspicious of her in any way.""

""But Sky was too busy trying to get on Caleb's good graces to notice. Steamy! Meanwhile, Sam was doing everything he could to impress his two teammates and not make himself a target, and it worked well. Sizzling!""

""And, after finally seeing the error of their ways, Sky and Caleb finally agreed to end their mutual distrust of each other.""

""Will the gang recover from all the scorching drama? Probably not, 'cause this time, I'm adding someone who's gonna kick things up to thermonuclear! This show is so hot, it'd take about a bazillion gallons of water to cool us off. And we got 'em! Comin' up, on Total! Drama! World Tour!""

A flock of geese flew under the plane as the intro sequence ended.

(Theme Song)

The episode faded into a shot of the Total Drama plane in flight; the shot cut from there to a close-up of a piece of cheese. A white-skinned hand snatched it from a mouse that had scurried on screen. The camera pulled back to reveal Izzy eating the cheese before she ran off, and with a continuous snoring, the shot quick-panned across the cargo hold where, oddly enough, most of the rest of the cast were sleeping. Scott, MK, Sky, Caleb, Heather, and Sam were spread out over the cargo bay door with a pair of swan-shaped paddle boats, and a pair of interns soon dragged Topher over by the armpits to join them.

The camera zoomed in on his snoring face, and a ripple effect transitioned the scene to what could only have been his dream.

Topher was shown walking down the red carpet in a location similar to the one used for the rock and roll challenge as hip-hop music began to play. The fanboy was dressed in a dark blue tuxedo and was carrying dozens of gemmies while the unseen and cheering paparazzi took pictures of him.

""Thank you! Thank you!"" he said to everybody charismatically. ""I always knew that I would be a worldwide sensation thanks to my very own hit show. It's what I deserve after all."" The camera cut to the end of the red carpet, where a limo was waiting and open for Topher.

Topher got inside the limo and closed the doors, putting his gemmies aside and leaning on his seat. “Butler, take me to my own professional and luxurious mansion,” he instructed after closing the door, and in an instant, he felt himself being blasted off through the street.

Topher suddenly began to feel dizzy. ""What is going-""

The scene rippled back to the real world, and the camera pulled back from Topher's face. ""-on?"" The dirty blonde had woken up mid-sentence, realized he was falling through the air along with the rest of the cast, and started screaming.

""WAKE UP!"" he yelled, rousing those closest to him, Heather, MK, and Scott, out of their slumber.

""Huh?"" MK muttered as she came to her senses enough to look down, realize what was going on, and scream. The shot pulled out again to show all seven contestants awake and screaming and falling, along with the pair of swan boats.

""Hey kids!"" Chris called out, the shot changing to show him looking down from the open cargo hold. ""You better get into your paddle boats!""

Sam looked around in panic and noticed the swan-shaped vessel. He quickly grabbed onto its neck, and the camera zoomed out to show Sky and Caleb grab onto its back. A pan to the right showed Topher, Scott, MK, and Heather grabbing the other one, and moments later the boats splashed down into a river running through a hilly forest.

""Ooh,"" Chris winced from the plane.

The shot cut back down to the water, the boats now floating with the current to the right. The seven contestants, dazed and drenched, got back on their feet. ""I'm starting to question why I even admired Chris,"" Topher told the three he was sharing a boat with.

Topher looked back and adopted a look of panic. ""Oh man,"" he said, looking backward, ""wa...wa...water...!""

""We're on the water, we know,"" MK said in annoyance as Scott saw what Topher had seen and gasped.

The camera cut to the large, roaring, and familiar-looking waterfall they were headed towards.

""Oh no!"" Heather cried as she and the other people in the second boat saw it.

""Waterfall!"" Scott exclaimed as he turned around in his seat and started paddling. ""Quick! Paddle!"" he commanded, Topher immediately complying in the seat next to him while MK and Heather gave panicked looks backward.

""Hurry!"" Caleb chimed in from the back of the first boat, Sky and Sam currently at the paddles.

""If we make it out of this,"" Sky prayed with a look above, ""I will train anybody out of shape, even if they're over 300 lbs!""

""If we live,"" Scott chimed in with a similar look, ""I'll let my sister, Alberta, have my stash of pork rinds!""

""If you let us survive, I'll allow Sam to have my game systems, and I tweaked them to have higher quality!"" MK added as she looked skyward.

The camera panned back to the other boat to show that Sam had been listening, and his brow had shot up in surprise. It quickly faded into steely determination, and he dramatically stood up while declaring ""Upgraded technology, here I come!""

Sam tied a rope around Caleb's waist, then threw him at the other boat, the hot player managing to grab onto the swan's neck.

Sam put the other end of the rope in his mouth, then resumed his paddling. Several people screamed as the camera zoomed out to show the boats drifting dangerously close to the falls, until Sam's paddling suddenly took effect and the lead boat took off, towing the other boat behind it.

The shot cut to a close-up of the river bank, the two boats shooting across the screen and crashing to the left out of sight. The camera panned across the landing site, the swan boats undamaged but the contestants strewn about panting in relief: except for Caleb, whose legs were sticking out of the stand and flailing.

""Caleb? Are you okay?"" Sam asked, dashing forward and grabbing him. With a few tugs and a grunt of effort, he managed to pull him free, and they shared a smile once he was back on his feet. ""Thanks for letting me do that.""

""No problem,"" Caleb replied with a dazed look. ""Not like I had a choice,"" he added, shaking away the daze.

""I guess that's true, and sorry for doing that without your permission,"" Sam told him. ""Anyway, let's check on the others.""

""So, Niagara Falls is pretty awesome, eh?"" Chris asked as the footage skipped forward to the furious cast walking along the beach with Chris coming up from the opposite direction.

""It almost killed us!"" Heather countered.

""Like I said, awesome!"" Chris replied. The camera cut to a close-up of the misty and rocky bottom of the falls, and the host continued. ""The Falls is the jewel in Canada's crown,"" he explained as the shot panned up, ""and, one of the top ten natural wonders in the world. It's also known for its fabulous casino,"" he added as the camera cut back to the beach, ""which is where we'll be heading for the first part of the challenge.""

The contestants smiled excitedly. ""Are you for real?"" MK asked.

A rotating wipe transitioned the footage ahead, the contestants in the same position but now frowning. ""Are you for real?"" MK repeated dully.

""Since you're all underage,"" Chris explained as the shot pulled back to show the cast assembled in what appeared to be the open space between a stage and its seating area, ""we had to move the challenge from the gambling floor to the far less exciting casino concert hall."" The camera zipped backward, revealing the various levels of seating and of course the stage itself.

""I wonder if anybody's performing?"" Caleb asked.

""Well you're in luck, Caleb my man,"" Chris answered. ""Last time on the Aftermath show, they had a 'Second Chance' challenge where one of the losers could score a spot back in the game. And we're about to enjoy a little number from the winner.""

""Ooh, I hope it's Anne Maria,"" Topher said with an eager grin.

""Or better yet, Ripper,"" Scott added.

""I don't like him, but that wouldn't suck to me,"" MK said.

""She's 200 pounds of sassy in a 90 pound package,"" Chris announced dramatically, the camera panning across the confused faces of the contestants as they tried to figure out who would be joining them, ""and she's wearing 12 pounds of mascara. Iiiiit's, Blaineley!"" He finished his announcement.

""What?"" Heather asked in shock.

""Who?"" Sky added.

""Why?"" Topher finished, joining the others in looking up at the stage above.

A trendy electronic theme began to play as the camera panned upwards, the stage lights flashing on and off as a gigantic cake rose out layer by layer from the stage floor with a familiar blonde-haired, red-dressed woman standing proudly on a barrel at the very top.

“Blain-Blain-Blain-Blain-Blainerific is my name, dishing dirt is my game! Invading your TV with my Blainelicious frame!” Blaineley sung into her microphone, the area behind her rapidly sliding away to be replaced by a red carpet scene for the second phrase. She shook her booty for the camera a few times, then the shot pulled back to show the red carpet scene through a television on a cart that Sam was standing in front of with a wide grin.

“Bla-Blainerific! S-s-so terrific!” Sam sang, moving his hands in the shape of Blaineley's curves which hung on-screen as a dotted line. As he sang, Blaineley could be seen turning around on the television screen, then darting off. She reappeared at the end of Sam's line, and shoved him away.

“I'm fa-fa-famous! Famous!” Blaineley sang, striking a pose then turning to the side to allow the camera close-up of her in profile.

“This has to be against the rules. Does Chris really think we're all fools?” Sky sang as an aside to Heather, the scene moving back to the casino concert hall.

“Rules? This ain't no Sunday school! Miss Thang up there's a ratings jewel!” Chris answered, abruptly leaning towards the gymnast and startling her.

“Bla-Blainerific!” Sam added in front of a shot of Blaineley confidently walking across the stage, dropping down when the woman came upon a disdainful-looking MK.

“M-M-Make me si-ick!” MK added haughtily as Blaineley walked by and promptly pulled a cord of rope hanging at the edge of the stage, causing MK to drop through a trapdoor.

“I'm fa-fa-famous. Famous!” Blaineley repeated as she walked off stage and into what looked like some sort of coffee shop, where Topher and Sam were seated in the background.

“Get me a half-fat no-foam latte steamed to a hundred-two heat!” She demanded as she reached the counter, the music screeching to a halt as a pale-skinned arm reached out to hand her her drink. ""I'm quite specific,"" she told the camera before taking the cup and walking back through the shop, the music returning as she went.

“She's Blainerific!” Sam sang eagerly as he watched the older woman walk by.

“So so horrific…” Topher added in disgust, also watching the woman walk out of the 'shop'. A star-wipe out from the center of the screen took the scene back to what looked like the casino concert hall where Blaineley was standing with her microphone in hand.

“I'm fa-fa-fam-” She began to sing before she was interrupted by the confused tones of Scott.

""Who's that girl again?"" Scott asked as an aside to Caleb.

""WHAT?!"" Blaineley yelled, the music screeching to a halt again as she leaned angrily towards an unimpressed Scott. ""Who am I? Who am I?"" she asked the devious farmer. ""Who are you?!""

""I'm the host of the 'Puppy Bachelorette',"" she explained, a smooth and patient elevator music type of tune playing as the scene wiped from the concert hall to some sort of fancy room set with various books and vases on a bookcase against the rear wall. More importantly, an adorable corgi puppy with a light blue bow on its forehead sat happily atop a small Greek-styled column in the foreground next to where Blaineley was standing.

""I was nominated for a Gemmie Award!"" Blaineley added, walking away from the puppy-centric scene, casually taking out a golden award and tossing it over her shoulder as she walked onto what looked like the interview set from her previous hosting job. ""I interviewed you for 'Celebrity Manhunt'!' she sharply told Scott, who was now seated in the interview chair and rolling his eyes.

Blaineley snapped her fingers, and a star-wipe transitioned the scene to her standing at a chemist's workbench, orange safety goggles on her head and glassware in her hands. The trendy electronic music started up again as the song resumed.

“It's a fact and scientific, that I'm still Blainerific!” She sang as she emptied the contents of a test tube into an Erlenmeyer flask containing some grayish liquid; the two chemicals immediately reacted by bubbling ominously then exploding in a cloud of yellow-green gas. The cloud quickly cleared, however, to show Sky and MK back-to-back spraying the area with fire extinguishers.

“She's not so famous! Turns out she's not so famous!” they sung to each other, smiling broadly as the song ended.

Blaineley scowled for a moment, then huffed and rolled her eyes. ""Ufff, whatevers! So which one of these lame teams am I on anyway?"" she asked, the camera pulling back from the stage to show the host and other contestants still standing below.

""You're on your own,"" Chris replied. ""Because as of right now, there are no more teams!""

Caleb and Heather shared an excited cry of ""Yes!""

""It's been fun working with you guys and finally merging for the first time,"" Sam told his former teammates.

""Me and MK are already a duo,"" Scott said.

“Are you sure you'll be fine on your own?” MK asked.

""I already have an alliance I can go to,"" Sam responded. “Good luck to you both.”

A sudden shoving sound got their attention, the three gasping as they saw what was being pushed out on-stage: a giant slot machine bearing the faces of Sam, Caleb, and Scott on its reels. It was being pushed by Chef, who was wearing his usual glittery pink evening gown.

""Since we are in the honeymoon capital of the world,"" Chris explained as the camera pulled back, showing the full cast and emphasizing just how big the slot machine was compared to Blaineley who was still on stage, ""I thought it'd be cool to drop some arranged marriages on you!"" he said, laughing with glee.

“Yet my very own angel isn't here,” Topher mumbled.

""Check it!"" Chris continued, the shot cutting back to the machine as Chef walked over to its lever. ""Slots o' fun for me, not so fun for you."" Chef grinned at the camera, then pulled the lever and caused the reels to spin: Topher and even a bear were represented on them. ""Each girl pulls the lever to win a husband who she'll team up with for today's challenge,"" the host explained as his assistant stayed in front of the reels, the camera zooming in as one-by-one they landed on Topher and the lights around the display started dinging and flashing. “Cha-ching!”

Confessional: Sky

""I've always dreamed of getting married to Trent one day..."" Sky said thoughtfully. “Though I can't rush things. After all, we're both still underage.""

Confessional Ends

The footage skipped ahead to a close-up of a trapdoor on top of the giant slot machine as Chef tried to force the lid down on Topher, Sam, Scott, and Caleb who were stuck in there together and quite vocal about their discomfort. Chef managed to stuff them down soon enough, only to let the door swing open again. The camera pulled back as he motioned to something above him; moments later, a brown bear was lowered from the ceiling in a cage.

""Umm...what's the bear for?"" MK asked fearfully, all four sidelined girls surprised and shocked at the roaring ursine.

""Casinos are all about excitement,"" Chris explained. ""And what's more exciting than a big, angry bear?"" he added, walking over to the machine as Chef guided the cage above the trapdoor, then gave a thumbs-up. That turned out to be a signal to cause the bottom of the cage to drop out, dropping the bear into the slot machine with the other contestants. Roars and screams and sounds of violence ensued as the trapdoor swung close again, and Topher could be heard saying ""Down boy!"" to it.

""Trust me,"" Chris told the future 'wives' with a smile, ""you don't want to land on that guy. Let the games begin!"" he announced, the shot cutting to the end of the line where MK stood. ""MK, you're up,"" Chris said, earning a raised eyebrow from the young woman.

""Well then,"" MK said, cracking her knuckles as she stepped forward to the arm of the machine. ""Time to win me a husband!"" She rubbed her hands together and pulled.

The reels started spinning, and with plenty of dings one by one they landed on...Topher.

""Not him,"" MK grumbled, frowning in annoyance, ""I'd rather have anybody but him!"" She walked forward to the open chute at the bottom of the machine, and slammed its door shut just as Topher could be seen and heard sliding down.

Naturally, the dirty blonde slammed right into the tightly-closed door with a metallic clang. ""What was that about?"" Topher asked from within the machine.

""MK!"" Chris announced happily. ""You've won-""

""I don't wanna marry Topher!"" MK told him, walking over to him. ""I can't stand myself to be around him if last season is evident enough,"" she added once she saw the glare Chris was giving her.

""If that's how you feel,"" Sky said, the shot cutting to show her already at the reopened shoot with a dazed Topher in her arms. ""I'll just take him, if that's okay with everyone."" She spoke quickly, already leading Topher away before the others could respond.

""Fine with me,"" MK shrugged.

""I honestly don't care,"" Heather chimed in, leaving Blaineley to shrug as Sky and Topher walked by.

Confessional: Topher

“I wouldn't like to be around MK anymore than she does,” Topher said nonchalantly. “The feeling's mutual between us.”

Confessional Ends

MK was preparing to pull the arm again when Chef suddenly grabbed her from behind.

""Whoa whoa there, quitter from another mother,"" Chris told her sternly. ""Back of the line for you."" Chef was shown dragging the short girl back across the stage past Blaineley and Heather. ""Blaineley, you're next.""

The oldest woman stepped forward and pulled the knob.

With plenty of dings, the reels spun and landed one by one on...Sam.

""Whoa-oa!"" Sam hollered as he tumbled out of the chute and landed on his chin.

Blaineley sighed in annoyance as she walked over. ""Well, at least it's not the bear,"" she said. ""Plus, marrying a fan favorite should help my image.""

""I'm a fan favorite?"" Sam asked excitedly as he picked himself off the floor.

""Actually, you're in seventh to fourteenth place,"" Blaineley replied simply. ""Nothing's as important on TV as your likability index. I've studied everyone's,"" she explained before giving her new 'husband' a quick look over. ""Now, what's going on with your face?""

""My jaw is kinda plump,"" Sam said, ""but I thought women liked that.""

Blaineley pinched his cheek, then tsked. ""Not what I meant. We need some make-up on those cheeks,"" she told him. ""Contour them correctly, and you lose five pounds."" Sam raised an eyebrow. ""Make-up! Pronto!"" Blaineley clapped with a happy smile that quickly faded when she realized her command had had no effect. ""Stat? 911?"" she amended, looking around in rising dread.

Confessional: Blaineley

""What kind of TV show doesn't have a make-up department?"" Blaineley asked the restroom camera in an irritable tone. ""This cast needs to get some gumption. And some agents,"" she finished as a sly aside.

Confessional Ends

""I don't know which one is worse,"" Heather said as she walked forward to take her turn. ""A dull as dirt guy, or a dirty guy."" She finished her thought on a bittersweet note, then pulled the lever.

The reels spun and dinged and landed one by one on...the bear.

""Oh...neither,"" Heather said, wincing at the sound of the bear sliding down the chute.

It landed on its rear, took one look at Heather, and roared. ""Um, hi,"" Heather said as she backed away. The bear quickly started chasing her.

""Has Heather finally found the man of her dreams?"" Chris asked the camera as it cut to show him standing at the far end of the slot machine, the bear still chasing a screaming Heather around the room. ""Will she get mauled at the falls? Find out after this!""

Initially we loved it. After about 1000 miles it started randomly popping up ""consider taking a break"" mostly on back roads. There are several threads about this on other models but it apparently can't be turned off even with lane assist and driver attention turned off. I contacted Hyundai and they were no help. I'm sure if I take it to the dealer they will take it out, not replicate it, and say it's fine. It is so insane to me that you would put a feature like that in and take away the ability to disable it, even when there are settings that would appear to do that.

Has anyone else had this problem and had an effective strategy to fix it? The dinging making me crazy. The fact that the car was so expensive and I spent so much blood and treasure for something that passive aggressively tells me to chill out and get coffee is making me crazier. If youve ever seen the ""Dennis takes a mental health day"" episode of it's always sunny, that show I feel about this car. ",3,1734270920.0,HyundaiSantaFe,0,1.0,False

I’ve got a great job that I love, financial freedom and stability, good health, friends & family, hobbies, and my very own cozy apartment. But there’s still one piece missing—maybe it’s *yo*u! I’m ready to meet someone special to share laughs, adventures, and all the little moments that make life magical.

A little about me: I’m a fun-loving guy who’s passionate about creativity and exploring new ideas. Whether I’m diving into an immersive video game, getting lost in a book, or sketching out some artsy ideas, I always enjoy finding ways to express myself and keep life interesting. I’m 5’9 with slim build, dark brown longish wavy hair, and glasses. I’d describe myself as kind, thoughtful, and someone who genuinely believes in spreading good vibes. Life’s too short for negativity, so I aim to make the most of every moment and bring joy to those around me.

I’d love to meet someone who’s up for joining me on this epic quest we call life. Whether it’s gaming together, sharing creative projects, or just talking about our favorite books over a cup of coffee, I’m looking for a partner who’s kind, open, and ready to build something meaningful.

If she’s still not sleeping well in a few weeks her neuro has offered to prescribe sleep meds, thank GOD because her primary doctor is ghosting me on the sleep medication question. 

Anyways, even though it’s a fight to keep her up until 8:30 because her eyes are rolling and she’s trying to fall asleep  at 7 most days, we’ve been doing it. Except yesterday 🤦🏼‍♀️ 

I was a hairstylist for 10 years before I had to quit to care for my daughter. Yesterday I spent all day doing my stepmom, sisters, and my own hair. It took all day from 12-10 pm as my stepmom and sister have enough hair for 10 people. It was supposed to be a fun day and time for me to do what was once my passion again, as well as do my own color so I can feel pretty again. 

And my dad and husband let her fall asleep at 7:30… I told them about three times they are playing with fire and she’s going to be up in the night. Husband said it would be fine.

And guess what - she woke up at 1 AM and has been up since then!! Husband swears it’s not because she fell asleep at 7:30 despite her sleeping through the night the past 4 nights when going to bed at 8:30-9:00 🙄 he thinks it’s because she has a very slight cough - no fever, only coughing very sporadically and randomly, not a chronic cough at all. 

It’s like he won’t admit he messed up and that I was right. 

At the very least though, my husband did lay with her all night and is letting me drink my coffee in peace right now so I can head to church solo this morning. I think that’s his way of admitting he messed up without admitting it…

Now the fight for today, try to prevent her from napping more than 45 mins MAX and try to keep her up until 8:30… wish me luck. ",1,1734270578.0,Autism_Parenting,0,1.0,False

We built a hide-away space for a twin bed to live in and pulled out for sleepovers. Ideally, I would like the plywood door to lift out and up.

We purchased hinges intended for a coffee table (link below), however we found they do not lift high enough to access the entire space when open. Additionally, they seemed a little flimsy, but that could have been cause the 1/2"" plywood is ~7 ft long.

We are open to any suggestions the community may have. Up and out would be ideal.  The door can flip up, but would like the hinges to be hidden (and how would the door stay up?).

Thank you!

1hespow,https://www.reddit.com/r/JetLagTheGame/comments/1hespow/wheres_your_hiding_spot/,Where’s your hiding spot?,"Here’s the situation. You’ve been isekai’d into an alternate universe where the only difference from our current universe is, you are the fourth member of the Jet Lag team. In all the team games, you’ve been on Team Sam instead of the guest stars, and the outcomes have been the same. You’ve won one of the four solo games, either Hide+Seek 1, or the Tag season of your choice. 

You wake up to the sound of the Yamanote line announcer saying that we will shortly be arriving at Tokyo station. Sam, Ben and Adam tell you to quit napping, because your run starts as soon as they are outside the ticket gates at the Marunouchi central entrance, and there’s no time for you to grab a coffee from New Days. You try and adjust to this new reality as you step off the train, and follow the boys out of the station. You step outside the ticket gates, you can see the departures board for the Shinkansen lines and the JR lines. Sam tells you “Go go go!”

Where do you go?

My choice would be a gamble of staying in Tokyo prefecture, but heading west to Takaosanguchi station. They wouldn’t expect me to hide so close to the starting point so after ruling out anywhere north of Tokyo station, they’d get on a Shinkansen towards Kyoto, and because it goes west that would show as hotter. There’d be no way to hide the fact that I am in a rural area from photos, but can easily hide just how close to a major city it is. My final spot would be on Inariyama trail, the least well known path up the mountain (it is marked but all the others are marked as trails 1-6, people do miss this one), leaving the seekers to search half the mountain before they get to me. I am known for liking mountains with shrines and temples on them, so once they have my prefecture they’d narrow down my station quickly but the endgame would be the difficult part for them.

His name is Thomas Redwood. He was a shy boy who lives in Los Angeles with his family. As he woke up, he looked outside his window to see the morning sun.

???: Morning Thomas. 

A voice said.

It was his mother. Emily Redwood, a loving mother she was beautiful. As she walked in.

Emily: You're up earlier than usual, ""said his mother. 

She loved her kids like they were the greatest things that ever happened to her. 

Good morning, mom. Thomas with a tried but happy tone. He was out of bed and about to get ready for school. 

Emily: It's time to get dressed, sweetie. Said his mother. 

Thomas: OK, mother, I'll get right on it.

After getting dressed, Thomas went to the kitchen to have bearkfest. He saw his dad come in. 

Luke: sup champ, how are you doing?

Thomas: I'm good. How are you doing?

Luke: I'm doing great. I'm about to go work now, son. 

Thomas: OK, then see you later, dad.

Luke: See you later, champ.

As Thomas finished his bearkfest. As He gets in his mom's car. 

Some small time later. 

Thomas was finally at the school he went to.

That being Saint James high school. 

As he's about to enter. He stopped to say goodbye to his parents.

Emily: Bye, sweetheart, we love you. 

Luke: See you soon, champ! 

Thomas: Bye, love you guys. 

As he's about to walk in, though the front doors of the school. He heard a voice that's sounds familiar.

???: Hey, Thomas. The voice said.

As Thomas looked up to see who it was.
It was mary Moonlight. A girl who was kind but can be scary at times.

Alongside her was her friend Katie Roade. A girl who is an emotionally smart person who is really friendly.

Mary: Hey, Thomas? How are you doing well? 

Thomas: I'm doing great. Thomas said with a happy tone. 

Mary: OK, later thomas, i see you later.

Thomas: Bye.

As Thomas goes to class, he enters his teacher's classroom. As he entered and sited next to his girlfriend. 

Mary: Hey Thomas.

Thomas: Yeah, Mary?

Mary: Do you think you are going to the park after school?

Thomas thought for movement about what to say. But then he said.

Thomas: I will be going to the thrift store. The one that's owned by an old lady.

Mary: OK then.

???: Hey Thomas Hey mary, listen. There is one you need to know.

It was Robby roots. A young boy who loves growing plants.

Thomas: Hey Robby, what is it?

Robby: I know this may sound crazy but I think we have enough time before our teacher comes back.

As Robby got the courage to tell Thomas and Mary about a strange music box that sends people to another world.

Thomas: Do you have proof that there is a music box that's sends people to another world? 

Robby: Yeah, I got proof.

Mary: Really?

Robby: Take a look for yourself.

As Thomas and Emily's eyes opened wide with shock. After seeing an image of the description about something called the calamity box. 

Thomas: Oh my god. It's real. it's really real.

Robby: Yeah, it's real. Maybe we can go see for ourselves?

Thomas: Uh...

Mary: we go see if it's real. OK?

Thomas: OK.

Some time after class.

Thomas was walking while in deep thought. If what robby is saying, then it must be true.

Little did Thomas know he'd walked right into a tower of plastic caps.

THOMAS STOP!!! said Leo, but it was too late.

As Thomas realised what had happened, he knew that he screwed up really badly.

s-s-sorry. Thomas managed to get out.

Sorry... SORRY?! ALL YOU EVER DO SCREWED THINGS UP THOMAS! jenny yelled with rage.

Seriously, dude. What was so uncool. Said Harry with a disappointed tone.

FOR ONCE IN YOUR DARN LIFE THOMAS! CAN YOU NOT MISSED THINGS UP! GOD!!! Said Millie in raged.

As everyone stormed off. Leaving Leo alone with Thomas.

L-leo. Said Thomas weakly. You don't think I'm a pain in the neck. Right?

Thomas... said Leo, annoyed. You can seriously be a pain in the ass sometimes. 

After hearing that. Thomas ran off in tears. He knew he missed up big time. 

He decided to go to the library to calm down.

Leo thought to himself. Were we too hard on him. He wondered to himself. Thomas just didn't mean to do it. 

But Thomas can be pain in the balls sometimes. He thought tho a part of was wondering if he and the others had gone too far.

Some time later...

Thomas was at the library. He's was trying to calm down as he's writing on a piece of paper. Venting out everything bad that happened today.

Am I really a Nuisance? Thomas thought to himself. No, that's not true. I am not a nuisance. It's just... fuck. Thomas said to himself.

Suddenly, Thomas noticed a book about paranormal things. As though the book. As he got to the page about the calamity box.

Calamity box? Treal to other worlds? Thomas said to himself.

Some short time later...

As he tries to find research regarding the calamity box.

???: Hello, thomas, the crybaby. 

A voice said with a rude tone. It was Corey Smith. Rude young boy with orange hair.

Thomas: Leave me alone, Corey. Thomas said with an annoyed tone.

Cory: Why crybaby?

Robby: Hey, leave him alone, jerk. 

Thomas looked to his right to see one of his friends. It was Robby. He has seen what Cory was doing to his friend.

Cory: Oh no, it's you. Why are you protecting this crybaby?

Robby: Thomas is not a crybaby. You are just a piece of good for nothing bitch.

Cory: Oh, listen you-

Thomas: NO! YOU LISTEN CORY! your work is fine as is. 

Thomas said in anger, clearly done, with cory's BS. Before saying.

Thomas: BUT YOUR BEHAVIOUR IS ROTTON TO THE CORE! I AM DONE YOUR BULLSHIT! JUST GO AWAY! LEAVE ME ALONE, YOU IDIOTIC BITCH!

Cory and Robby were shocked by Thomas's outburst. As he's stood up and walked away from the table.

Cory: Thomas, you need to take it easy. 

Thomas NO!

Thomas pushed Cory on the floor. As he's ran out crying.

Thomas: ALL YOU DO MAKE ME AND MY FAMILY'S LIFE A LIVING NIGHTMARE!

Robby: Thomas, wait!

Cory: Come back, Thomas! I'm sorry!

???: it's time to strike.

After running for Witch, it feels like forever, Thomas stood run in front of a thrift store. As he's looked into the window. As he saw a music box with 6 gems on it.

Thomas: Is th-th-that the calamity box Robby was talking about?

As he's looked closer, he's realised it really is the calamity box.

Thomas was looking for something to do, but as a way of coping.

Thomas: Maybe I should buy it with my birthday money. 

As he's grabbed the box and paid for it. As he's left the store after paying. He went to the park that was not far from the store.

Meanwhile...

Mary and Katie were at a coffee shop. just they chilling and having fun. 

I wonder if Thomas is OK. Mary said calmly with an obvious hints of worry.

Yeah, he's been really quiet since he left to go to the library. Said Kaite.

Suddenly, Mary's phone starts buzzing. As she looked at it, she gasped.

What's wrong, girl? Katie asked with a concern tone.

Thomas ran away from the library in tears! Mary said, horrified.

Wh-WHAT?! kaite said in shock.

We have to find him! Mary said with a rare, serious look.

As the girls ran out of the building. I'm going to find Thomas and find out what happened at the library.

???: Oh, you silly girls. You have no more no idea what you got yourselves into.

Some short time later. Thomas was at the park. Someone came up to him.

Thomas, what are you doing here? Said a voice.

It was ryan Roade. Katie's brother, who's really smart and really kind, boy.

Oh, hey Ryan Thomas said, trying to hide his tears.

Ryan: Are you crying? Are you okay?

Thomas: I'm okay. I'm just tired.

Ryan: Oh, ok. Let's see what's inside.

Thomas: OK then.

as he was about to pull out the box. That was until.

???: THOMAS SNOWLY REDWOOD! 

A voice yelled as the duo looked to his right. Only to see his girlfriend and her friend Katie. She looked really angry. As she walked up to him and slapped him.

Mary: What... the hell... WERE YOU THINKING?! 

she yelled. Her voice was full of rage.

Thomas: Uh oh, full name. Can you give us a moment, Ryan?

Ryan: OK then.

Ad Ryan walked back behind some trees nearby.

Thomas: So... about Cory.

Mary: Forget Cory. Don't you run off like that! You hear me! I was worried sick! YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN FUCKING LOST OR HURT! OR WORSE! 

she said her full of rage. But there she was also doing something else. She was crying.

Mary: You, Jerk. *cries* You, Jerk. 

Said Mary calmly, tearing up.

Katie: Seriously, Thomas, what you did was missed up.

Thomas: I know. I know. What I did was wrong, and I'm sorry. I understand if you're angry at me for good reason.

Mary: *Sigh* i know, I was just really concerned about you.

Mary: Just don't do that again, please?

Thomas: OK. I promise I will never do that again. I promise.

As Thomas cried softly. Mary knows about what Leo and the others said to thomas. Including what happened at the library. 

as she sat down next to Thomas and hugged him. Letting him know she will keep him safe and that everything will be OK.

Meanwhile, back at the thrift store.

A group of 3 girls were three. One of them named Anne boonchuy. Was inside the thrift store while her friends were outside the window of the store.

Wait, where is the box? Anne said, confused. 

Anne and sasha were confused while marcy was devastated.
Knowing that her plan to go to another world had failed.

That was until...

Sasha's phone starts buzzing as sasha pulled out of her pocket. 

Sasha looks at her phone to see a Mary posted a picture of Mary and her boyfriend Thomas, who's holding the music box. The same one marcy was talking about.

Sasha: anne, come see this.

Anne: What is it sash? 

Sasha: Someone posted something about a music box. They boyfriend bought. We should go see.

OK, then let's go. Anne said as the trio went to the park to meet Mary and Thomas. 

Once they got there, they saw Thomas and mary. As the trio appropriate, the couple. 

Sasha: Hey, what are you Twerps doing? 

Sasha said with a serious tone. I'm wondering where that music box is. Sasha said.

Oh, uhhh hello? Said Mary, nervous. What are you doing here with your friends.

Marcy: Why did you let your boyfriend 
do this. 

Marcy said with an upset tone with tears falling from her eyes. 

Mary: I'm sorry, Do what?

???: You and the others are about to find out girls. 

Katie: Who are you?

Thomas: Where is the music box? And where is Ryan?

???: he's not going to be a problem anymore. Because i corporal him. Which made him pass out.

Thomas: wh-wh-what?

Mary: Oh god, no...

Katie: Oh no, not my brother.

???: By the way, you might be wondering why the box is right?

Thomas: Where the hell is it?

???: right here, little Thomas.

As the mysterious person throws the box as it lands in Thomas's lap. 

A few seconds later, Thomas and the girls disappeared without a trace.

As Thomas slowly woke up with the music box next to him. He's realised that he is in the forest.

Thomas: MARY! KATIE! GIRLS! ANYONE?!

As Thomas then realised his current situation. He's begins to cry. Not only is he alone but is now trapped in an unfamiliar world far away from earth.",1,1734269463.0,amphibia,0,1.0,False

I know this is due to spending time with family over the holidays which we always talk about past experiences and reminisce over a photo album. It’s also due to me thinking about what I want to achieve in 2025. Either way, I’m surprised at how much I’ve changed since meeting my tf. Family seems to notice it as well. As I sit here watching the sunrise and drinking my coffee, These are the things that readily come to mind but I’m sure I’m missing a bunch. How have you changed?

1. Courage. Ive noticed I don’t back down like I used use to in the past. I push forward even when things seems bleak. Maybe it’s because I feel like I’ve gone through hell and back with this journey that the troubles that arise on a regular basis, seem minor in comparison. I definitely feel like the Phoenix rising.
2. Boundaries. In kind of the same note I noticed i’m more aware when people around me are taking too much of my energy and when to put up a boundary and pull the energy back into myself. Prior to my TF I was definitely more of a giver at the expense of my own health. It’s not to say that I still don’t have compassion and give to those I love but just more of an awareness of when to put up a boundary and show MYSELF some respect.
3. Compassion and feeling life around me. Prior to meeting my TF I never truly understood heartbreak and the pain that people go through. I used to have a cold approach to love. Always assumed that love and feelings were something that you could turn on and off like a light switch. I can now feel more deeply the joy and pain behind the lyrics of a song, the feelings behind a coworker’s eyes when they’re telling me a story, I can now feel life when the breeze runs through my hair on a long walk.

We have a large main room that functions as both living and dining room. We have two young kids and are a house that many people gather at (which I love).

For a long time I’ve wanted to get rid of our two sofas that are past their prime in comfort and get a big sectional for everyone to be able to hang on. We don’t have a $15k budget for some sexy Ligne roset I would love unfortunately. 

Anyway, the sofa was delivered today. Superrr comfy but I just can’t tell if it looks silly in the room and has taken away the cool/sophistication that was there before. I really need a new rug and coffee table and trying to figure out if that alone will improve it. Can also shrink the new couch a bit by removing a seat from either end of the sectional.

My body felt like it was over reacting to almost anything I ate. If I drank alcohol my heart would race all night. Almost any food and I was flushing. I also developed stomach acid issues and my diet became so restrictive as a result of trying to manage it. I was experiencing a lot of feminine problems which at time strangely seemed connecting to foods or drinks. 

My dog sadly passed away. He was an allergy dog himself and an excessive- and I want to say extreme- shedder. His hair was everywhere and came off him in showers of hair. It was embedded in all my laundry. He peed his bed every day so I had to wash his bedding every day then was always trying to clean our washing machine out as it was then become embedded in all our clothes. 

Since he died, all my issues have gone. I have had a couple of alcoholic beverages and been able to get a good sleep. I have been eating and drinking a little more freely (although I haven’t pushed the boundaries too much yet.) I have even been managing a morning coffee and slice of toast with no stomach acid issues. 

The only other variable is that I was a lot more stressed when my dog was alive as I loved him to death but he was a lot of work. Health issues, reactive, peed in the house, shed everywhere so I never felt peaceful in that way when your house is clean. 

I have another dog, same breed but not much of a shedder and quite peaceful. I’m wondering if I was allergic all along? My chest would sometimes get red if he lay on it and there were a couple times I would feel itchy but nothing too noticeable- I wasn’t breaking out in hives or anything. 

I’m wondering if there was some kind of immune response to chronic exposure. Thinking of getting a pet dander test as this would prevent me from getting a dog in future. Could my improvement in histamine symptoms be correlated to my dog passing? ",1,1734269168.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become increasingly popular among people seeking to enhance their smiles. The impact of teeth whitening can often be profound, with noticeable results that boost not only aesthetics but also confidence. Let’s explore what you can expect when you undergo teeth whitening, comparing the before and after results to understand its effectiveness.

### The Science Behind Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening works primarily by using bleaching agents like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. These substances penetrate the enamel—the outer layer of your teeth—to break down stains and discolorations. As a result, you can achieve a brighter smile in just a few sessions. Many treatments are available, from in-office procedures to at-home kits. Each option provides varying degrees of efficacy and speed.

### Before Your Teeth Whitening Treatment

Before you choose to undergo teeth whitening, it’s essential to evaluate your current dental health.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Consultation with a Dentist:** Always consult with a dental professional to assess whether whitening is suitable for you.
- **Examine Existing Dental Issues:** Address any cavities or gum problems before proceeding.
- **Set Realistic Expectations:** Understand that results can vary based on the type of whitening used and individual dental conditions.
- **Home Care:** Regular brushing and flossing can prepare your teeth for treatment, ensuring better outcomes.

### Teeth Whitening Options

Selecting the right teeth whitening method is crucial for achieving optimal results. Here are some popular options:

- **In-Office Whitening:** Offers immediate results under the supervision of a dental professional. This process typically takes about an hour and can lighten teeth several shades.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits usually contain lower concentrations of bleaching agents. They’re convenient but may require several applications over weeks.
- **Whitening Strips:** Available over-the-counter, these strips ease the process of whitening with a more gradual effect.
- **Custom Trays:** Made by your dentist, these trays can be filled with a whitening gel for at-home use, ensuring an even application.

### The Immediate Aftereffects of Teeth Whitening

After treatment, many individuals notice a brightened smile almost instantly. However, it’s essential to understand what to expect:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Sensitivity:** Many people experience temporary tooth sensitivity in the days following treatment. This sensitivity usually subsides and can often be alleviated with desensitizing toothpaste.
- **Brightness:** The most evident change is the increased brightness of your teeth, which can improve your overall appearance.
- **Staining Risk:** Newly whitened teeth can be susceptible to staining, so it’s crucial to avoid dark-colored foods and drinks, like coffee or red wine, post-treatment.

### Long-Term Effects of Teeth Whitening

The long-term impact of teeth whitening can be very satisfying. Patients typically report not only a whiter smile but also increased self-esteem and willingness to show their teeth more often. Here's how you can maintain your results:

- **Maintain Dental Hygiene:** Continue brushing and flossing diligently to prevent future staining.
- **Regular Touch-Ups:** You might consider periodic touch-up treatments to keep your smile bright.
- **Dietary Choices:** Adopt habits that avoid foods known for staining teeth.
- **Follow-Up Appointments:** Regular dental checkups can help you monitor your teeth's health and appearance.

The journey from before to after teeth whitening is transformative. By choosing the right method and taking care post-treatment, you can enjoy the benefits of a brilliant smile for years to come. Whether in a personal or professional setting, a bright smile can significantly improve your confidence and presence.

In the world of aesthetics, teeth whitening serves as an accessible option to enhance your appearance. Remember, though, that the results can vary based on individual circumstances. So, make sure to plan accordingly and consult a professional to ensure your whitening journey lands you at the smile of your dreams!

One of the most effective ways to whiten teeth is through professional treatments offered by dentists. These options typically produce the most dramatic results, making them popular among those seeking a complete makeover for their smiles.

- **In-Office Whitening:** This method involves applying a high-concentration whitening gel to your teeth, usually activated by a special light. Most patients see a significant change in just one visit. Results can make teeth up to eight shades lighter.
- **Custom Take-Home Kits:** Dentists can also provide custom kits with professional-grade whitening gel. These kits tend to take longer, often requiring daily application over several days or weeks. While not as rapid as in-office treatments, many users find them effective and convenient.

### Over-the-Counter Whitening Products

If you prefer to whiten at home, several over-the-counter products are available. These options can vary in effectiveness, but many users report satisfactory results. Here are some popular products:

- **Whitening Strips:** These easy-to-use strips are coated with a peroxide-based gel. Users typically apply them for about 30 minutes daily. While treatment duration can vary, most see improvements in about two weeks.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Although toothpaste can help remove surface stains due to its mild abrasives, they generally do not contain enough whitening agents to change the actual color of your teeth significantly.
- **Whitening Mouthwash:** Similar to toothpaste, mouthwash can help keep your teeth fresh and stain-free, but it's usually less effective for dramatic whitening changes.

### Natural Teeth Whitening Remedies

For those who prefer organic methods, various natural remedies claim to whiten teeth. While results may be less predictable, they can be a gentle alternative. Here’s a look at some common natural methods:

- **Baking Soda:** Known for its abrasive properties, baking soda can help scrub away surface stains. However, overuse may wear down enamel, so moderation is essential.
- **Activated Charcoal:** Some people use activated charcoal to absorb toxins and stains. While this might have a temporary whitening effect, evidence supporting its long-term benefits is limited.
- **Oil Pulling:** This age-old method involves swishing oil (often coconut oil) in your mouth to remove bacteria and promote oral health. While some swear by its efficacy, scientific support is lacking.

### Comparing Effectiveness

When considering which whitening method to choose, think about the effectiveness, time commitment, and side effects. Here’s a brief comparison:

- **Professional Treatments:** Highly effective with immediate results; can be costly.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** Mixed effectiveness based on the type and brand; more affordable but may take longer to see results.
- **Natural Remedies:** Generally safe but may offer less dramatic results; great for those sensitive to chemical treatments.

### Expected Results

The results of these whitening methods can vary from person to person. Factors like the starting shade of your teeth, individual lifestyle choices, the method of whitening used, and consistency of application all play a significant role. Typically:

- **In-Office Treatments:** Often yield the best and fastest results.
- **At-Home Kits:** Can achieve significant improvement, though it may take several applications.
- **Whitening Strips and Toothpaste:** Mild to moderate results.
- **Natural Remedies:** Minimal results, more suitable for maintenance than major transformation.

Whether you choose professional treatments or at-home alternatives, achieving a whiter smile is within reach. Understanding the different methods and their efficacy will help you make an informed choice. Whichever path you take, remember to consult with a dentist before starting any whitening program to ensure it's safe for you.

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening can significantly enhance your smile, transforming the way you feel about your appearance. The results from various methods can vary, but one thing is clear: many people experience a noticeable difference in their confidence level after whitening their teeth. Whether you choose professional treatments from a dentist or at-home kits, the potential for a brighter smile is more accessible than ever.

Understanding the different whitening methods is crucial to achieving the best results. Professional services, such as in-office bleaching, often provide the most dramatic before and after transformations. On the other hand, over-the-counter products and natural remedies may offer more gradual improvements but can still lead to meaningful changes. It is essential to assess your individual needs, budget, and time frame when deciding on a whitening approach.

Regardless of the method you choose, it’s vital to maintain good oral hygiene to prolong those brightened results. Regular brushing, flossing, and visiting your dentist will keep your smile radiant long after the initial whitening treatment.

Remember, the journey to a whiter smile doesn’t have to be overwhelming. With the right information and techniques, you can achieve impressive before and after results that elevate your confidence and enhance your overall appearance. So, start exploring your whitening options today—your dream smile is within reach!

I found out I have chronic gastritis after I had a horrible entire month of July. It probably started with a virus infection first (because I had diarrhea and fever for a few days) but it became a month long gastritis because even after weeks of being careful with eating (at times I only ate cooked potatoes with salt, and generally I left out all kinds of sugars, uncooked vegetables, coffee, alcohol, fried food etc.), I still felt weak, I lost 10% of my weight, had diarrhea, was constantly nauseous, stomach aches and just didn’t felt like myself anymore.

At some point I started eating again all kinds of food because I was so fed up with it, but I made the decision to try out a gluten free diet. That actually helped me a lot and after another month I felt quite normal again, even though I am not gluten intolerant. So 2 months after the whole thing started I had the chance to get a colonoscopy. On the day of the appointment I asked them if I could also get a gastroscopy at the same time. I thought why not both if I have to do this whole dieting for a day thing anyway… to my surprise they found my colon to be completely intact, no gluten intolerance whatsoever BUT my gastroscopy actually ended up being the interesting part. They found an esophagus infection, probably stemming from reflux and a light chronic gastritis. I just thought:“ that explains everything“

Now here we are almost half a year later and I have an active gastritis again. For the last days I couldn’t eat anything without feeling nauseous afterwards, my stomach constantly twisting and turning when I lay down, my stool turning yellow again and me starting to feel super weak again. It really hit me because it felt just like in summer and I was really in such a bad mental condition back then. You cannot underestimate the mind and body connection that some people like me feel really strong and how much it affects your general mood when your body is not in a good situation. I remember I had a darkest thoughts and something that felt like depressive episode.

I try to think more positive now and look towards the end of it, because I know it does get better again. One thing my mom gave me and I believe it can help a lot is shredded flaxseed mucus. You prepare it by leaving the shredded seeds soak in water over night, then you cook it the next day and then you drain it so the slime remains. And then you drink it (best warm) throughout the day a couple of times) and it creates a protection layer. It really has helped me a lot and I can slowly feel more comfortable eating again, although I am still extremely careful with what I eat and I stick to a strict gastritis friendly diet.

I know it’s a small thing and if you suffer from severe gastritis or chronic gastritis you have heard of things like that for sure. But for me this was all new and I am learning so much about my body, I believe there is something for everyone to help them get better.

Not with words, but with a touch,
My fingers tracing the curve of your jaw
As the first light of dawn stretched across your skin.
You stirred, just enough,
The faintest sign that you were waking up to me. You weren't a morning person always, but you loved waking up to my alarm. 

The room was silent, save for the faint hum of the world outside,
But the air between us? Charged.
“I need to know,” I murmured,
“How do you take your coffee?”

Your eyes opened, dark and knowing.
There was no hurry in the way you looked at me—
No rush, only the promise of something more.
“I take it strong,” you said,
And I could hear the edge behind it,
The unspoken truth that lingered between us.

I rose then, fluid,
Moving with purpose,
Each step deliberate,
A hint of control in the way I handled the cup.
I poured it slowly, the warmth rising in the space between us,
The scent rich and heady,
Just like the tension between our words.

I returned, handing you the cup,
Leaning close enough for you to feel my breath on your skin.
“Careful,” I whispered,
“You might find it’s stronger than you think.”

You took the cup without hesitation,
The heat of it nothing compared to the heat between us.
Your eyes met mine over the rim,
And I could see it—the flicker of something dangerous.
You set the cup down,
Then looked at me as if you were weighing your next move.
“Is that all?” you asked, voice low,
A challenge laced in the words.
“Or should I make you beg for more?”

And just like that, the day shifted,
Because now I was no longer just making coffee.

1hes9oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hes9oi/aitah_for_blocking_a_college_friend_after_she/,"AITAH for blocking a college ""friend"" after she disrespected my boundaries?","I (F20) have started med school 2 months ago. My boyfriend (M21) and I have both wanted to become doctors since we were children, so we moved together and started our studies. Before our first semester, a group of 25 people decided to meet in a café to get to know each other before uni hit. 

We had a great time there and met four people that we grew a bit closer to. Over the course of the next few days, we spent a lot of time together and basically, this is how our friend group started out. Everyone was being nice and my initial fear of not making friends in college was really eased.

As lectures started, we all continued to see each other frequently. We sat together, ate our lunch together and overall talked a lot. I noticed that there was one girl (F21, let's call her Lana) who was getting especially close to my boyfriend. I did not think much of that, I was rather happy to see it actually as he is an introvert and doesn't open up to new people as quickly.

During orientation week, the two of them spent a lot of time together. While the rest of our friend group was out and about drinking and discovering the city, they preferred to stay at home. Which was completely fine- they're both rather introverted and drinking is not everyone's cup of tea. She even came over to the flat my bf and I share and they cooked a meal together which came in handy when I came home tipsy and hungry 2 hours later. We hadn't talked as much one on one before, but that evening, we had nice talks about reading, music and general little smalltalk topics. 

A few days later, Lana started contacting my bf a lot more over channels like WhatsApp. Turns out, she doesn't live in our city and has to commute everyday. Thus, she doesn't show up to lectures as often, leading to less in person contact. At first, I was really unbothered by that too. But one day when my bf was sick and alone in the flat as I was attending lectures, she called. For me, calls are something very personal as I have had a fear of making calls for all of my life. As my boyfriend put it, she just talked and talked and wouldn't hang up. He didn't really get to say much and he wasn't particularly interested in her monologue either as he was just sick and really tired. He told her, but that didn't really change anything. He's a real people pleaser sometimes and just didn't have the courage to hang up on her, so he let her talk. 

The whole thing took 4 hours. 4. Hours. Even I don't talk to him that long on the phone. Lana hadn't contacted me once during that time. Also not our other friends. Just him. As I mentioned above, calls are a very personal thing to me. I mentioned this to my bf immediately when he told me about this incident and he apologized profusely. She wouldn't stop calling over the next few days, he did pick up as he did not want to ignore a friend's calls, but broke off the conversation after a little so she wouldn't take advantage of his time again. She bombarded him with text messages asking all kinds of questions, seeming really interested. As much as I just wanted my bf to find friends, I could not watch that and be happy. I could understand that Lana had a better connection to him than to the rest of our friend group, but showing no interest in anyone other than him seemed a bit much to me.

A few days later, my bf met up with Lana for a coffee to have a talk about what was happening. She had recently complained to him that I was being ""cold"" towards her (which I wasn't, I just didn't have any special connection to her as she wasn't trying to contact me at all)- obviously, that is not something you do. So my boyfriend told her she should rather talk to me about that concern and also made clear that long calls are a boundary in our relationship. 

I tried to be nice to her and she proposed that we should meet. Just the two of us. I don't really like one on one meetings with people I don't know that well, so I was a bit cautious and told her I was really busy (which wasn't a lie as the first exam was already coming up). I tried really hard not to dislike her for basically almost ignoring everyone out of the group but my bf.

It was then that the gossip started. Our friend group decided to go to a karaoke bar one evening and she was actually coming with us, which was a surprise to us as she commutes and had made no effort to participate in any of our group activities in weeks. One guy brought a friend that the rest of us hadn't met before. It was an enjoyable evening. However, the next day, Lana started gossiping about our new acquaintance which no one really understood as we generally all liked her. 

I just said ""well, I think she's really nice"" and let it go as I didn't feel the need to defend a person I've only known for one evening more than that. Lana confronted me after and asked me what my position on the whole thing was as she apparently really disliked that person. I just said I didn't really have an opinion and didn't want to say more about it. I found it odd that she asked me to speak on the topic as, like I said, we weren't really in touch. I found it unfair to put me on the spot like that.

In the meantime, she also started to use my bf as her emotional trash can. She was frequently complaining to him about everything someone out of the group said or did around her, mostly it was about them not replying to messages as quickly as she would like or about not feeling included (which was a situation she created herself in my opinion). He wasn't pleased at all with his new role, but again didn't really dare to say anything harsh. 

She started calling randomly again (this time, her calls weren't picked up anymore as exams were approaching and the excuse ""sorry, I'm too busy to be on my phone that much"" was working). I felt really disrespected about that at this point. Boundaries were communicated and she still chose not to change her behavior. Also, she grew more and more hostile towards the rest of the group. She was frequently running her mouth about everyone and just dumped all her sh*t talk on my poor bf. He didn't even really reply much at this point. 

She stated again that there was some kind of problem regarding me. My bf told her she could just talk to me about the problem. She did not. Instead, she decided to start gossiping about me one evening. To my boyfriend. Like girl, have you lost your mind? 

He obviously didn't reply to anything and just said ""keep it to yourself, I am not gossiping about my partner"". She then proposed another personal talk. At this point, my bf wasn't really interested in that anymore. She had clearly overstepped the boundaries of our relationship, so there wasn't much to talk about. 

I was growing really angry at this point. I was still waiting for her to communicate with me. So I decided to take matters in my own hands and texted her. I started off by saying I was not imterested in that hangout she proposed (the one I mentioned above where it was supposed to be just Lana and me). She replied in a really passive aggressive way, it was something along the lines of ""well, I didn't think you wanted to do that in the first place"". My patience was really coming to an end here, so I said ""you're right, I kind of didn't after what you pulled, glad we're agreeing here"", to which she again replied ""Well we're not, at least I'm being honest with friends instead of being salty""- which is absolutely hypocritical. How can she even talk about honesty after literally gossiping about everyone in the most disgusting way possible? For instance, she said about one girl in our group that she was ""as interesting as a potted plant"". She never communicated with anyone. So all I did at that point was to say ""I don't know where I was being salty, as far as I know, that was all you... And apart from that, I don't need someone running to my bf to gossip about me instead of just talking like a normal adult would. Good night"". I then blocked her as I felt everything had been said. 

I kind of feel guilty about just cutting her off, but she has really been giving me a headache over the last few weeks. There is no constructive talking to her. I've seen the chats between her and my bf and all she ever did was playing the victim and accusing people of all kinds of things. Remember how I said making calls was personal to me? Well, she told my bf I was overprotective and jealous in her opinion. 

Not everyone would have blocked her, I guess- but that's just how I like to handle people I don't want to be in contact with. It's my life and therefore, my choice who gets to be a part of it. Needless to say, my bf and her aren't in contact anymore either. She has been thrown out of the friend group since people found out how she has been talking about them behind their backs.

(Repost) ,"I(f21) have been friends with Anna (f21) and Destiny (f21) for 10 years, we went went to school together and got picked for the same high honors etc. Anna was always very kind, vibrant and timid, and Destiny very 'nice', outgoing and boisterous. We were all extemely close, coming from difficult backgrounds; we found family in each other. I was usually the mediator between them, Anna only had us as friends while Destiny was extremly outgoing and made friends/frenimies everywhere she went. After graduating high school I moved very far away to go to college in a big city, I've since dropped out and focused on work but through it all we kept in touch. I had trusted Destiny more or less to supplement the space I'd left because Anna and I were also very very close. I started noticing that when we'd call, Anna had become even more dulled and reserved and wouldn't say much at all. Destiny was often speaking for her. It made me uncomfortable but I didn't think much of it, I usually trust my intuition but I didn't want to. I thought everything was fine up until I went back home to visit. I realised, visiting them that Anna was very sick and they had both been weirdly pretending that she wasnt. She has an autoimmune disease that wasn't being properly treated and she looked like death itself. Mind you I was aware of the illness and Destiny still claims that she was taking care of her/her caretaker but in reality they were just smoking weed together and every now and then she'd stick around to help her clean/ help with household chores. Well, then, to a year ago, Anna ended up going to the hospital and got more distance between them. Anna's parents found out how Destiny had been affecting her and got a restrainin order against Destiny. I sided with her parents against Destiny, calling her selfish and awful and a terrible influnce. She couldn't turn up to Anna's house to take her car or anything like that but unfortunately Anna still cared for her and wanted to be around her, she didn't see that there was anything wrong at the time and thought that she was the center of everone's problems. Anna loved her to death and didn't see anything wrong with how she was being treated. So all this distance was hurting her and making her feel a little helpless and with no one else to count on, her and Destiny reconnected. i spent a lot of time talking about what had been going on, how important Anna's health was etc, and since Anna still respected her, and loved her, we chalked it all up to basically a misunderstanding/everyone makes mistakes, that kind of thing. So for Anna's sake I forgave Destiny for making MANY mistakes and apologized for making her out to be a monster. After Destiny spent all her money, and could find no one to take care of her, she had to live in her car. I offered half-heartedly for her to come live with me in the city, where there was more work and opportunity. It was August and come September it would begin getting much colder back home, with the restraining order out against her, she finally had nowhere to turn. It would work to my advantage too (or so I thought) to have someone help me with bills. Also, worth mentioning: I live in a studio close to downtown and pay $1,100 in rent and two bedrooms in the same complex are the same price but they have an income requirement that I don't meet (hilarious, I know). I was very hopeful that she could come out and we'd eventually get our own place. Being in management at my place of work, I gave her a hell of a reccomendation and secured her an interview. Sucess was set up, so to speak. If I am to be completely honest, my biggest motivation was hoping that Anna would follow close behind as I really wanted to have her back in my life and with all that considered, we made a loose plan and Destiny sold her car and flew out. (4 months ago) After being here for two weeks, she began seeing one of my close friends, Eddy. I had more or less turned him down in the past because hes very immature and controlling, I had also warned Destiny off him for this exact reason, clairifying that he was more or less a playboy and his intentions couldn't be trusted. My advice fell on deaf ears and they grew close very quickly. I was innitially worried about her but from some of the character traits I've listed I pretty much have assumed she can hold her own. It was great at first, having an old friend during what I can only describe as a very lonely time for me. Destiny and I spent more time getting reaquainted, when I got home from work i had someone to watch tv with and every now and then she'd share food she'd doordashed with me. Sometimes i split the bill when i had a specific request. She met all of my current friends, and of course became very familiar with them, I didn't mind because my friends may as well be hers and I'm generally a secure person.  She was very nice to everyone and even went out of her way to contact everyone I was close with to throw me a surprise birthday party. I felt so lucky, really. But when I learned how much she'd really spent on the rental etc, I was filled with a little dread for our soon to be jointed finances as we were meant to be living together. (It was close to 1.5k). Even though things were going pretty well and beyond my expectations, some things were secretly falling through. Destiny had lashed out at my bosses for questioning her experience (which is their job, I fear) and ended up spoiling the opportunity and hurting my reputation as she demanded more and more from them while having little practical skills. She also managed to split up my friend group by starting drama with Eddy's ex (the friend group is mostly her family). By choosing to support their relationship, I lost my friends as well, all the people who had come together to celebrate me. The last straws for me was that 3 weeks in, she moved in with Eddy, officially. You see, this whole time she'd been coming to the apartment less and less and strangly had been coming over while I was working to take her things to her boyfriend's. Again, I didn't think much of it because I didn't think she'd leave without a thought after the important plans we made. Even though i more or less supported their relationship, i didnt think it made sense to move in so quickly.
I invited her for a coffee date to go over our finances. I stressed the importance of finding a job because it can become overwhelmingly expensive here. She said she needed more time but we agreed that she'd move back in and would have her own space when she wanted it when she applied for the two bedroom with me and generated half of the rehousing costs. I also offered that since I already have managed to cover my bills for a year, it would basically be no change as I could afford the apartment myself again. I was hopeful this would take some of the pressure off. But Anna and Destiny were keeping in contact and over a phone call I shared what was actually going on with Anna she was confused.
 Destiny was putting on a good face, saying how well everything was going and still claiming that she lived with me and contributed to the household even though she'd been moved out for a few weeks already. While talking to Anna, she intentionally downplayed her relationship with my friend Eddy and kept telling Anna that nothing at all had changed, she was in love but we still had the same place in her lives and we come first and that we saw each other all the time. She lied about moving out to Anna too. On top of that Anna let me know that Destiny claimed to be taking care of me now- Apparently the conversation Destiny and I had about finances was told to Anna in an entirely different context and it couldn't have been further from the truth. Destiny insinuated she was 'helping me' out of pity and obligation. 
While she was eventually insisting she'd help me with my bills and give me money, I was feeling especially angry with her. I dont want to rub people the wrong way by saying this but considering my age, I've worked 8 hard years to get to where I am now and I take myself a little more seriously than I used to- being treated/assessed as a charity case pissed me right off and felt like a slap in the face considering she was the one just jumping to the next best thing.
Eventually, Anna came to visit- just over a month ago now. Things fell through in so many ways and many arguments were had after Anna and I braved the harsh reality: Destiny had been lying about anything and everything to both of us the whole time and once we were together and realising that, Anna opened up about their relationship: The reason Anna had gone quiet was because Destiny was constantly gaslighting her to make her feel stupid or treating her like a child and belittling her because she can't care for herself at times. She formed habits with Anna and then dissapeared for days, taking Anna's car to go see her own friends. They had been ""Sharing Finances"" which really meant Destiny had pushed her to spend Anna's $11,000 savings on the both of them and their habits (smoking) while Destiny had never actually held a job apart from scamming people. She'd been lying about coming to see her so she can take Anna's car and drive for hours and hours every day, sometimes on trips to neighboring states to visit boyfriends and the like. Worst part is, Destiny has her own car but didn't want to put the miles on it. Most things I knew but now undrestood in a totally different context. (Again everything I had known was more or less through Destiny). It makes me sick she was pretending so long to be so selfless.
Destiny said she wanted to see her before she left but made no attempt so as a last ditch effort, we attempted to test her and had an unspoken agreement about the outcome... Anna and I had spent her 'last day' secretly extending her visit a week to see if Destiny would indeed make better plans as she promised. We thought well if she keeps saying she wished she'd had more time/chances let's give her that. (I know it's petty but I really wanted to call her bluff). She asked us if Anna was on the plane yet and what was going on and we deceptively avoided the question. Ultimately this only enraged her more, saying we were ignoring her that day and teaming up against her. She could see Annas location the whole time and was checking to see if she'd really left! She did not make plans that week and claimed to be sick the whole time, Anna and I got the Flu and she said shed gotten it too (forgetting that she was dating my friend, Eddy, who said she was sick but fine and accompanying him to work). We did hang out once more after i begged her privately to at least see us once or twice and even though we had fun, she pretended again that nothing had happened, that all was well and good. It left a bad taste in my mouth and it was the fourth and last time Anna had seen her in a month, despite Destiny's promises for us to spend 'every day' together.
Anna has returned home now, feeling estranged from Destiny, who ultimately blamed all the turmoil on Anna and I for not being supportive of her new life and relationship and her chance to be ""selfish for once"". She's turned our own words against us saying that we wouldn't hang out with her and her boyfriend when Anna visited. That she was so tired of begging us to hang out (??) Even though she had made herself completely unavailable apart from a few times of a month long trip, despite having no job or responsibilities and only pushed to make plans into late ours like 2am to party despite me having to actually work 10 hours each day, 5 days a week. Mind you Anna and I had a fantastic time, made some great memories and she did her best to spend every waking moment with me soaking up our time together(Destiny was almost always invited, given times and dates and never showed).
I understand that we're not children anymore and that life happens but this much just feels unforgivable and Anna finally agrees with me. I don't even know if her apologizing would make a difference- not that she would as she's made it clear there's no point in trying to, 'make her feel bad' because she has, 'nothing to apologize for'.
Anna is better now, but is still not the same. Shes recovered in health and independance and this time apart has taught her a lot, I've advised her to only look after herself and focus on strengthening mentally, which she has. 
Even though  I can't stand the way Destiny plays nice and puts all the blame on us as if we are not also people with our own lives, i still feel really bad for everything. We've been through a lot and spent so much of our lives together- half our lives. I wonder if Ive done the right thing wedging us apart and breaking up the friend group. Knowing the life shes had, I'm willing to forgive a lot and for a while I maintained that we were still family but I cant ignore that it definitely does not feel that way anymore. There is much more that has happened but I feel like this is enough,
Am I the asshole for wanting breaking up my friend group and pushing her out?",1,1734267991.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

Hes incredibly picky about clothing. I wanted to buy him a nice pair of sweatpants to have when baby arrives, but even that is a risk. Anything I buy him must be easy to return because it’s that bad with him. I hate it. Here’s some info on him:

He loves: specific sports teams, anything outdoors (hiking, backpacking, fishing, camping, skiing, etc), food, IPAs and wine, cooking, golf

Has communicated: feet are always cold, doesn’t want anything he can wear, wishes his coffee maker kept his coffee hot for several hours (and looked for something during Black Friday and didn’t see anything worthy of buying)

Gifts I bought him that he returned: a new backpack and suitcase (his were broken), several articles of clothing, a subscription to a monthly cheese, several beer related items, tickets to sporting events of teams he likes

Consider him the pickiest person in the world. If you can brainstorm gift ideas for me, I’d be forever grateful. The only thing I’m leaning toward is a gift card to his favorite golf course. I also wanted to do a cute gift from baby (imagine a big and small version of a sweatshirt or something so they match), but that’s also risky with him.

I noticed she was gazing at me every time I arrived at the course, and she started smiling once I began to greet her. We started to talk to each other before the start of the course and I can clearly affirm that we had a connection.

After talking 2 times, she disappeared (I will discover in the future that it was because she changed her job that forced her to follow an unsuitable schedule with that course).  
Anyway, I probably made the error of investing too much in the connection we had (I suffer from brutal OCD, so maybe that has been one of the reasons). So I decided to find her on FB and contact her after some weeks.

As many of you would say, it was a huge mistake, in fact, she replied but was cold af. I asked her to go outside for a coffee but she replied saying that she would have preferred to meet at the gym. So she informed me about her new gym schedule and I started to follow some courses just to meet her (insert facepalm here).  
I noticed that she was a bit colder than before, but she wanted to continue to see me, she always came to my place while finding me at the gym, and always wanted to talk... But just that, the situation became stale.

Every time I wrote her on FB she was always super cold (two or three lines of text at maximum). I decided to follow her on Instagram, and she accepted my request but never followed me back, and this was quite devastating. And also through IG I discovered she has a boyfriend, with which she's living (She never mentioned her boyfriend to me).  
I decided to go nuclear saying that I would never want to meet her again while deleting her on all the social media, she was sad but accepted my decision.

It's absurd, I had also another girlfriend in the meantime, but it took months to forget about her. Last week she appeared in my ""people you may know"" section of FB, so I know she could have visited my profile and this triggered my obsession with her just like a year ago. I tried to contact her just to ask how her life was going, but, as you can guess, I got ghosted.

I know that it could appear absurd in your eyes since I've never had a romantic relationship with this girl, but it is what it is. I felt a connection I'd never experienced in years, but probably she was only seeking attention at the gym...I'm feeling bad about investing this amount of energy in her, but again, it is what it is.

I don't know how to enjoy all these disposable income i've earned in exchange for slaving away. So, really, working is not for me.  

Money doesn't bring happiness, in my case, because i was already that person who detested consuming and consuming and all the materialism going on in our lives. 

I am okay surviving on only rice, beans, eggs, a little bit of veggies and fruits if I get to have my precious time all to myself and not have to wage-slave. So i think i'll go back to being a NEET.

I'm a health-nut (as you can tell by how i live) and as i'm getting well into my 30's and realizing that i'm actually aging aging, wage slaving is not the way to go. you have to get plenty sun-light, work out, eat modestly and read books and stuff. Money is not worth it. Money is not worth it.

1herpl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyWitch/comments/1herpl9/todays_full_moon_in_gemini_for_every_zodiac_sign/,Today's Full Moon in Gemini for every zodiac sign,"Here's my little astro update with tips for every zodiac sign. I go deeper over at my blog and YouTube (links in my bio). Hope this serves!!!

The interplay of Mercury, Mars, Venus, and Neptune creates a multifaceted astrological atmosphere—one that’s as enlightening as it is disorienting. Mercury’s pivot to direct motion suggests the end of a chapter and the beginning of new conversations. Mars’ retrograde invites us to refine our actions and intentions. Venus in Aquarius challenges us to revolutionize relationships, while Neptune’s direct motion dissolves illusions, urging us to embrace clarity. Together, these transits craft a celestial narrative of reflection, recalibration, and reawakening. The Gemini Full Moon illuminates the duality of existence, pushing us to balance intellect with intuition, independence with connection, and dreams with practicality. The cosmic energy is ripe for breakthroughs, albeit not without growing pains. Whether it's in personal epiphanies or collective shifts, this lunation encourages us to navigate complexity with grace and curiosity.

Zodiac-Specific Guidance

Aries (3rd House: Communication, Local Community) This Full Moon shines a spotlight on your communication style and immediate environment. Reflect on how you share ideas and connect with those around you. Revisit ongoing projects or conversations for newfound clarity. Think of this as upgrading from smoke signals to WhatsApp—faster, clearer, and less prone to misinterpretation.

Actionable Tip: Embrace active listening. A thoughtful approach to dialogue can uncover valuable insights.

Taurus (2nd House: Finances, Values) The Full Moon activates your sector of resources and values. It’s time to assess your financial strategies and ensure they align with your core beliefs. Remember, a penny saved is not just a penny earned; it’s also a future coffee splurge during a Mercury retrograde.

Actionable Tip: Revisit your budget and explore ways to align spending with long-term goals.

Gemini (1st House: Identity, Self-Expression) Happy Full Moon, Gemini! This is a profound moment of self-realization and personal transformation. Step into your authenticity and let go of outdated self-perceptions. It’s your cosmic makeover montage—cue the upbeat soundtrack and bold decisions.

Actionable Tip: Celebrate your growth by setting intentions for the future version of yourself.

Cancer (12th House: Spirituality, Solitude) This lunation encourages introspection and spiritual renewal. Dive deep into your inner world and embrace the healing power of solitude. If your life were a Netflix series, this is the episode where you journal by candlelight.

Actionable Tip: Practice mindfulness or journaling to explore your subconscious.

Leo (11th House: Networks, Aspirations) The Full Moon highlights your social circles and long-term dreams. Reevaluate your connections and ensure your aspirations reflect your authentic self. Think less “networking event” and more “found family dinner.”

Actionable Tip: Network thoughtfully and align with communities that support your vision.

Virgo (10th House: Career, Public Image) This is a moment of culmination in your professional life. Reflect on your achievements and consider what needs restructuring to align with your aspirations. Imagine this as a PowerPoint presentation for the universe—professional, impactful, and sprinkled with just the right amount of flair.

Actionable Tip: Seek feedback from trusted mentors to refine your career trajectory.

Libra (9th House: Philosophy, Travel) The Full Moon illuminates your belief systems and thirst for adventure. It’s time to broaden your horizons and explore new perspectives. Maybe it’s time to book that spontaneous trip or finally crack open that philosophy book gathering dust on your shelf.

Actionable Tip: Engage in learning opportunities that challenge and inspire you.

Scorpio (8th House: Transformation, Shared Resources) This lunation delves into themes of intimacy, transformation, and shared finances. Let go of control and embrace the power of vulnerability. Think of it as Marie Kondo-ing your emotional baggage—if it doesn’t spark joy, it’s time to let it go.

Actionable Tip: Reassess financial partnerships and emotional boundaries.

Sagittarius (7th House: Relationships, Partnerships) This Full Moon lights up your relationship sector, encouraging reflection on partnerships, both personal and professional. Are your relationships balanced and fulfilling, or have compromises tipped the scales too far? It’s a prime time to explore collaboration but also to set boundaries where needed. Picture it as a cosmic counseling session, only with fewer tissues.

Actionable Tip: Initiate heartfelt conversations to clarify expectations and strengthen mutual understanding.

Capricorn (6th House: Daily Routines, Wellness) The focus shifts to your health and day-to-day habits. This is your celestial nudge to declutter your schedule and streamline routines. Think of it as a Marie Kondo moment for your wellness plan. Are your current habits sparking joy, or just sparking stress?

Actionable Tip: Create a wellness checklist that integrates physical, mental, and emotional health goals.

Aquarius (5th House: Creativity, Romance) This Full Moon highlights joy, creativity, and matters of the heart. Whether it's a burst of artistic inspiration or a romance that feels like it was written by Shakespeare (minus the tragic ending), this is your time to shine. Let your inner child out to play.

Actionable Tip: Dedicate time to a creative project or indulge in something purely fun and spontaneous.

Pisces (4th House: Home, Emotional Foundations) The Full Moon illuminates your home and family life. Whether it’s literal renovations or emotional ones, this is a time to nurture your roots. It might also be the perfect moment to reconnect with family or spruce up your sanctuary.

Actionable Tip: Declutter your space to create a calming environment that mirrors your inner peace.",1,1734266145.0,BabyWitch,0,1.0,False

1herory,https://www.reddit.com/r/6thForm/comments/1herory/do_apply_to_university/,DO APPLY TO UNIVERSITY,"**5 Reasons Why You Absolutely Must Apply to University:**

1. **Unlimited Noodles, Unlimited Freedom** At uni, no one will judge you for eating 50p instant ramen at 3 a.m. every day for a week. It’s called *independence,* and it’s glorious.
2. **Student Discounts Are ELITE** 10% off ASOS? Spotify Premium for £5? Free coffee just for showing your student card? Companies will throw discounts at you like you’re their favorite person on the planet.
3. **You Get to Escape Small Talk About Sixth Form** “How’s Year 13 going?” Nah, forget that. At uni, you can tell people you’re *studying* astrophysics while actually playing Mario Kart.
4. **It’s Basically a Holiday Camp** Think about it—your mates are all there, no parents to tell you to clean your room, and you can leave lectures whenever you want (not recommended, though).
5. **No One Knows Who You Are (Finally)** At uni, you get to re-invent yourself. Be that mysterious person who shows up to lectures in flip-flops and a beanie and still somehow becomes the most interesting person at the pub quiz. *No one remembers your awkward teenage phase*—you’re free to become the legend you always knew you could be.

**THE REAL REASON?**  
Your future self will thank you when you’re earning cash, living your dream, and casually saying, “Oh yeah, I went to uni” at every dinner party. Don’t think—APPLY.",62,1734266061.0,6thForm,7,0.93,False

It’s super low-frequency: we’re talking monthly bars, not daily or hourly.

Historically, these short-term government bonds have not only held their ground during stock market downturns, they have often performed really really good. The idea is to ride the longer-term trends in both directions. My goal was to find a strategy that is uncorrelated when it comes to exposure to my stock heavy portfolio with strategies. I found that commodities or bonds would be the best way to go.

**Strategy Basics:**

* **Long Entries:** When price closes above a 10-month MA and RSI(2) > 80.
* **Short Entries:** When price closes below the 10-month MA and RSI(2) > 30.
* **Exits:** Opposite side of the MA line.

**Results from 1990–2024:**

* Total gain: $5,616 (1 contract worth 2$ per point, no fees)
* Win rate: \~40% (trend-followers often have low win rates but high RR)
* Maximum drawdown: \~$1,072
* CAGR (10 000$ starting capital): 1.28% (while the yearly gains doesn't look nice when looking at it like this take alook at the image below when the profits actually are gained)

[A Backtest from 1990-2024 of the 2-Year T-Note strategy](https://preview.redd.it/v5g1lydb907e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0cfda8e5ea9f40a6de6f92e2f4d591e56abbca3)

**For the Tinkerers:**

* Try different MA lengths or RSI thresholds. I have found some other settings to work great on 5-year bonds, Coffee beans and some other soft commodities.
* Add risk management like stops or position sizing rules.
* Test on other bond or commodity markets, I would love to get some more ideas and inspiration if you have some similar strategies.

It’s super low-frequency: we’re talking monthly bars, not daily or hourly. 

Historically, these short-term government bonds have not only held their ground during stock market downturns, they have often performed really really good. The idea is to ride the longer-term trends in both directions. My goal was to find a strategy that is uncorrelated when it comes to exposure to my stock heavy portfolio with strategies. I found that commodities or bonds would be the best way to go. 

**Strategy Basics:**

* **Long Entries:** When price closes above a 10-month MA and RSI(2) > 80.
* **Short Entries:** When price closes below the 10-month MA and RSI(2) > 30.
* **Exits:** Opposite side of the MA line.

  
**Results from 1990–2024:**

* Total gain: $5,616 (1 contract worth 2$ per point, no fees)
* Win rate: \~40% (trend-followers often have low win rates but high RR)
* Maximum drawdown: \~$1,072
* CAGR (10 000$ starting capital): 1.28% (while the yearly gains doesn't look nice when looking at it like this take alook at the image below when the profits actually are gained)

**For the Tinkerers:**

* Try different MA lengths or RSI thresholds. I have found some other settings to work great on 5-year bonds, Coffee beans and some other soft commodities.
* Add risk management like stops or position sizing rules.
* Test on other bond or commodity markets, I would love to get some more ideas and inspiration if you have some similar strategies.

1hergdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hergdu/just_found_out_30_m_that_my_girlfriend_27_f_has_a/,Just found out [30 M] that my girlfriend [27 F] has a crush on her coworker. How do I talk about this with her?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for four years. Lots of ups and downs. The past few months have been hard for both of us. She goes to school and her previous job slowed down significantly. I’ve been paying for most expenses to help ease us through until she found a new job.

Anyway, she found a new job (been there around a month) and ever since starting she has talked about a coworker (I’ll call him Ted), also new, who “flirted” with her on the first day. Apparently this guy “flirts” with a lot of women there and has a reputation. My girlfriend becomes friends with him and another young woman (I’ll call her Jaime) where all three have a group chat. They all usually work closing shifts and almost every time she works with them, she gets home really late. It used to be that she would text me when she was staying out late. We live in area that gets sketchy at night so I try and stay up in case I need to walk with her. Now, she doesn’t text me with a heads up anymore.  I just always assume she’s hanging out with.

Ted always suggests going to an arcade, playing pool, or getting food with my girlfriend and Jaime and my girlfriend always gets really excited. I’ve never been to an arcade like that with my girlfriend, and we don’t even do stuff like that lately to try and save money. But she’s fine spending money with them.

Jaime ends up getting a crush on Ted. Jaime has a boyfriend who is very possessive. He doesn’t like when Jaime is with Ted. Their rocky relationship ends because Jaime breaks up with him. Jaime is smitten with Ted, but my girlfriend and Jaime fine out Ted has a girlfriend who he never shared anything about until recently. Nothing develops between Jaime and Ted as far as I know.

My girlfriend talks about them all the time. Shares that Ted goes in her car to talk with her a lot. Shares that a different coworker doesn’t like my girlfriend because she sees them and because of how friendly all three are at work. My girlfriend wants to go on a double date with Ted and his girlfriend. I don’t want to because I don’t trust Ted even though I’ve never met him.

My girlfriend starts being more concerned with her looks at work. Starts asking me what perfume smells good. Says how Ted asked her and Jaime to come in on their day off to eat lunch with him. She gets FOMO because she doesn’t go. She starts staying up until 2 am texting on her phone.  I’ve never seen her do that in our time together.

I used to joke with her that he’s her work hubby. I don’t usually get jealous because I trust her. Now my jokes are becoming more laced with truths. I mention how I never see her after work and when I see off for work, I joke that I’ll see her tomorrow.

This is not something I’d normally ever do unless I had a burning suspicion. I check her tablet that has her texts synced to it. I see their conversation filled with flirty messages. Short messages going back and forth teasing one another. Flirty emojis. They start saying good night to each other. She mentions how he owes her a massage and coffee. They make plans to go to the arcade after work. He apologizes for making things weird after closing. They both acknowledge there’s tension between them and that they’re attracted to each other. Ted is backing off but also encouraging her to share what’s on her mind. She says she mainly feels it when they’re alone and that she tries hard not to be flirty or inappropriate and that she likes the tension. She likes when they hug. She thanks him for massaging her. He asks how he can help to make her feel more comfortable about the tension. She admits she has a crush on Ted and thinks it’s “fun and annoying” because they both have partners and knows nothing will come of it. Ted thanks her for sharing and they both say goodnight.

The next day rolls by. My girlfriend asks Ted to share more about how he feels. She asks if he likes the tension, if he has strong feelings, if he’s attracted to her, or if he has a slight crush too. Ted says he likes her as a person, and hasn’t thought too deeply about it other than she’s pretty.

My girlfriend says that makes her feel a lot better because she’s been putting too much thought into it knowing nothing will happen. She says knowing it’s just surface level makes it easier for the crush feelings to pass. She also asks if they can forget about her admitting this stuff so they can go back to being friends. 

The next day rolls by. My girlfriend says she thought about it more and doesn’t have a crush on Ted. She said she wasn’t thinking clearly and wanted to clear it up because she doesn’t want him to think that she’s feeling a certain way and that it’s too quick to call it a crush. Ted is fine with it but still gives off that he wants her to be comfortable.

All this to say, I have no idea what to do. I know, I know, breach of privacy. My gut was telling me to look and I’m honestly glad I did no matter how much it hurts. I have a feeling if I bring this up, she will get mad about me looking at her messages, but she is the one swooning over this person. It hurts because I’ve been loyal to her through it all and now I’m questioning everything.

We live together, have a cat, and I can’t even sleep next to her right now because I feel like the trust is in shambles and I keep imagining their quiet moments together. It sucks to know that she will continue to be around this guy every day at work too.

TLDR: my girlfriend has been texting a coworker (also in a relationship) and openly admits to having a crush on him. They hug a lot apparently, he massages her, are spending more time outside work together. He doesn’t openly  reciprocate the feelings. She withdraws her crush on him.

Hello All,

Was hoping for some insight.

Have recently started getting brief spells of tachycardia during the immediate cool down after physical activity. For example if I briefly run, then once I stop running, a minute or so later as my heart slows and returns back to normal it races again, and usually for around 10-20 seconds.

This can be quite intense, and even after walking it occurs. So definitely limiting and unnerving. I can usually stop it by forcing a yawn - it does seem sometimes it is related to how I am breathing before it starts. 

I saw my doctor and she has suggested 3 day holter and in the meantime to take flecainide. This has worked in terms of suppressing it but I don’t like the idea of being on this long term.

I am 46m with history of AF. Exercise a lot, 5-6 times a week so reasonably fit. Take medication for blood pressure and cholesterol (runs in family). When this started I was in the middle of a dry spell in terms of booze and hadn’t drunk anything for a month, so wasn’t like that or coffee caused the stimulation.

Any ideas or thoughts on this eg cause for concern, why it has started, ideas on treatment etc would be good.",1,1734264710.0,Heartpalpitations,0,1.0,False

*My name is Mike, I’m a 23 year old guy working at a coffee shop in a small village, but this doesn’t matter anyway. I just want to tell you what happened before I jump off this cliff. It all started last week. I woke up, had a quick breakfast, then wanted to go to work. There was a big storm outside, so I even took my umbrella.*

*As I got out of my house, I noticed it wasn’t just water raining. People were fucking falling from the sky. One landed right next to me, his head basically disappearing from the impact. My heart almost stopped before I ran back to the house and sat near my window, watching the outside world like some kind of maniac.*

*The storm lasted another five hours. I didn’t even call my boss to tell him I was not coming in, I’m sure he saw the events as well. I went outside again. Bodies were everywhere. Hundreds of them. Maybe thousands. Nobody else was outside. I could understand this, probably everyone was scared, and would rather stay in their house.*

*Then I looked at the dead bodies. Some of them were so mangled from the fall, I couldn’t even recognize them. But some of them were my neighbors. That’s why nobody from the neighborhood was outside. They were all dead.*

*I spent the rest of the day wandering around the village, trying to find any survivors. There were none. I even called everyone I’ve ever known in my life. I found the corpse of my boss on the top of his house. There was no logical explanation for how this could’ve happened. Every fucking person in the village was dead, except me. There was no tornado, as far as I’m aware.*

*No news stations were talking about the events. I had no idea what to do next. It was already late at night when I got home. Walking back to my house was terrifying. Terrifyingly silent. No cars, no people, nothing. Something wiped out the whole village, except me. I thought I wouldn’t be able to sleep, but luckily, I was so tired I fell asleep in a few minutes.*

*The following morning, it was another big storm. And as I looked outside the window, I was shocked. People were falling from the sky again. At first, I thought the wind picked up the dead bodies from the day before, and was throwing them around again, but when a few hours later I went outside, there were twice as many bodies.*

*But something was strange. Every single one of the corpses was male. That wasn’t the case on the first day. And every one of them had black hair. Just like me. I was thinking about stealing a car and getting out of the village to seek help, or maybe an explanation. It wouldn’t be stealing anyway, as everyone here is dead. But I just wasn’t able to drive, the emotional trauma from these events prevented me from focusing.*

*The following week, the storm continued. It started every morning around 7 AM, sometimes only lasting an hour, and sometimes it went on until midnight. Every day was the same. More and more bodies started to pile up on the streets and in my yard. Lots of times I heard the falling bodies hitting my house.*

*The national news didn’t say anything about what was happening, I didn’t find anything about it on the internet. But then where were the bodies coming from? The whole village was dead on the first day of the storm, but a week later there are still hundreds of new bodies falling.*

*As the days went on, the bodies started to look more and more like… me. It was so uncanny, I just basically grabbed as much food as I could from the empty store, and hid in my house. Weeks went by like this. Every day, I was thinking about ending it all. And when I didn’t have any more food left and went out again, I froze as I stepped out of my door. Every dead body looked like me. And they weren’t just similar. They were exact copies of me. Like clones, or twins of me.*

*After I was able to overcome the initial shock, I decided to finally grab a random car and drive as far as I could from this hell. I grabbed my now dead neighbor’s car, and drove as fast as I could.*

*I drove two hours before I reached the nearest city. When I finally arrived, I quickly found a parking lot, then quickly jumped out of the car, I was so happy I could finally see living people. But…*

*They all looked like me. They looked at me like I was crazy. But they were all copies of me. I ran away. Now I’m here, standing at the edge of this cliff. I hope someone will find this recording and solve this mystery. I won’t.*  
*Audio recording ends*

Fascinating, isn’t it? It’s amazing how can a brain alone can imagine a whole life for itself, and how easily it could turn into a nightmare, after some small electrical impulses. Although it’s an interesting subject, I find these experiments unethical, and I don’t want them to continue. But nobody listens to me. I shared this because I want people to know about the experiments. Maybe a negative public opinion can convince them to stop.
