Do any coffee shops in Burlington offer maple for free anymore like at the mixing station w creamer, sugar etc? 

Yes I get it’s pricey, but I just like making my own coffee and don’t want to bother the barista when it’s a simple drip coffee order.

Also PSA Starbucks literally does not offer maple. Total missed opportunity for their Vermont stores. “Maple is not a flavor at Starbucks” - shameeee",1,1770686899.0,burlington,0,1.0,False

I’m a 36-year-old guy from New England, and like a lot of people here, I’ve never been in a relationship. It wasn’t for lack of trying — shyness, bad timing, and life just kept getting in the way. But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:

Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. Ive been in the news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media covered it. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

If you’re local, maybe we could start with something simple like coffee. No pressure — just two people seeing if there’s a spark.

1r0mv0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r0mv0g/aitah_for_bringing_up_an_issue_i_had_with_to_my/,AITAH for bringing up an issue I had with to my roommates,"I 22m am renting a house with a friend and three others. I am the “lead” resident as it is me who pays to the landlord and all the bills are in my name (idk if that is important). In addition not sure if it’s important but all of us are queer.

To start let me introduce the crew names will all be changed, me 22m, Amy -24F, Collin -23M, Eli -19, Ted -28M. Only me, Amy , and Collin pay rent as Eli is Collin’s younger sibling. The reason why Ted doesn’t pay rent is a long story, to simply it they lost their job and are best friends with Amy. And so Amy wanted them to move into her bedroom, me and the other housemates said yes as long as amy covers ted’s part of the utilities, and while ted is without a job (terrible job market in my area) that he clean up more around the house (think communal chores; vacuuming living room, wiping down counters) 

Before anyone moved in we had made a common set of rules basically our pet peeves of and what not, 

example: you must message the chat when having people over( just a heads up so everyone knows who’s there), no loud sex, quiet hours after 10 on week days, etc. We had made rules about dishes staying no longer than 48 hours in the sink. This rule has not worked out for me, Collin, and Eli. Amy and Ted always cook dinner but never clean their pots and pans until after 48 hours or someone has to remind them. This had dragged on for a while and after holiday me Collin and Eli came back and the kitchen was basically trashed. Food mess, rotten dishes, moldy food in the fridge, floor covered in gross mess. And we had a conversation about keeping it cleaner and cleaning up after ourselves, along with the suggestion of coming up with a chore chart. 

After the household meeting Amy and ted came to me and said they didn’t like being the ones to blame for the mess and that it was hurting their feelings as they felt like they could never do enough. Along with that Amy said me and Collin couldn’t complain as we had left craft stuff out while we went on holiday. I’ll admit the craft stuff was clutter, but it was only on the craft bench and a coffee table. 

After some back and forth we finally agreed we’d all pitch in and clean up the kitchen and from there on out make sure we cleaned our own messes.

Here’s where the issue comes in. Amy and Ted only ever clean their dishes after being told to. Me and Collin always wash and put our dishes in the dishwasher. I wouldn’t have an issue if they had just left it over night and came back in the morning or had to go to work but it can take days for them to actually wash anything. And not only is it frustrating to go to cook something and realize every pot is dirty, it has also been taken a toll on me. I do struggle with mental health and my mentality is generally influenced by my surroundings. Meaning when things start to get dirty or tense I spiral. So I will relay the messages I sent to our house chat verbatim 

Me: Hey so I've tried to be patient and understanding about the dishes but it's causing me a lot of stress and lowkey effecting my mental health. I sorry but the rule needs to be changed to washing your dishes when you make them. 

Amy: ok-the rule needs not be changed. rule was set that if someone tells u to wash or whatever u do it with in two days. we are all being compliant. cooking a meal takes a lot of dishes, dishes will pile up. thats ok, as long as it gets done i see no problem

Me: Well I'm telling you it bothers me, and I know it also bothers C as well. I can't come home or enter the kitchen without seeing the pile up and being overwhelmed. Everyone has to work around the mess and it is a common space, so if you don't have the energy to clean the mess you shouldn't make it. 

Ted: it bothers you why? to simply see? both you and cy rarely cook in the kitchen so it can't be an issue of convenience. if it was, i think you would have said so. if you want to add a rule that dishes can't be left on the counter/stove and must fit in the sink or be washed, i think that would be reasonable. demanding that a rule change without discussion is not how to coexist with people in the same household.

Me: I can agree to that, and I don't cook because it's always messy I actually usually skip dinner as I don't want to go in the kitchen - And I'm asking for a compromise as I don't see cleaning up after yourself an unreasonable request it is a common space as we all pay rent 

Amy: ok all dishes must fit in sink, excess must be washed day of. dishes in sink still have same grace period of 48hrs as before. we need not discuss this any further

Ted: well talk to us about it instead of blowing up when you can't take it anymore. no one can understand how you feel or what you're thinking until you tell them. most things can be handled with a calm conversation. again, you shouldn't outright demand things. it's not the cleaning up that's unreasonable. it's the fact that it was not a ""request"". you did not ask a single thing, you stated ""the rule NEEDS to be changed""

Me: Yes and the rule has been changed I'm sorry if I made it sound like it had to be changed exactly how I wanted it just that it needs revision  - And this is me communicating that is become too much for me, I'm not blowing up or angry just letting everyone know so we can all have a healthy living environment.

End of messages 

I’ll admit I got mad when ted said this, I tried my best to be calm and respectful but I’m left wondering if I’m the a hole?",2,1770686213.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1r0musy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltBeautyHub/comments/1r0musy/finally_channeled_my_inner_chaotic_curator_with/,Finally channeled my inner chaotic curator with this smeared monochrome look: (My secret is using a cream shadow stick and a fluffy brush for the blend) 🖤,"Ever tried to translate a whole mood board into something you can actually wear to grab coffee without feeling like you're in costume? That’s been my personal challenge lately. I've been deep-diving into the *Reverie Escapist* aesthetic – thinking soft focus, a touch ethereal, slightly undone – but for a daily life that involves spreadsheets, not just wandering through a misty forest. My goal was to capture that dreamy vibe without looking like I'd pulled an all-nighter or tried too hard. It’s a delicate balance, and honestly, the first few attempts veered a bit too close to ""sleepy"" rather than ""dreamy.""

After some mixing, matching, and a surprising amount of subtle smudging, here’s what’s been working for a low-key, wearable Reverie Escapist look:

*   **The Ethereal Eye:**
    *   **Shadow:** I started with the **ColourPop ""That's Taupe"" palette**, specifically using the shade 'Boa' (a soft cool-toned beige-grey) all over the lid and into the crease. Then, I lightly pressed 'Slated' (a deeper matte grey) onto the outer corner and softly blended it out, making sure there were no harsh lines. The key here is sheer application; it's about a wash of color, not opacity. *Price point: Around $14.*
    *   **Liner:** Instead of a sharp line, I used the **NYX Epic Wear Liner Stick in 'Brown Perfection'** (a dark cool brown) and drew a very thin line at the lash line, then immediately smudged it out with a tiny brush. This gives definition without the severity of black or a crisp wing. *Price point: About $9.*
    *   **Mascara:** Just a single, light coat of **Essence Lash Princess Mascara** (the green tube, because it’s solid and doesn't clump easily) on the top lashes, focusing on length over volume. *Price point: Around $5.*
*   **A Touch of Color:**
    *   **Cheeks:** This was a tricky one. I found that a very cool-toned, almost dusty pink blush applied high on the cheekbones, blending towards the temples, gave that lifted, slightly flushed-from-within look. My current go-to is the **e.l.f. Putty Blush in 'Bahamas'** applied with a damp sponge. It’s subtle and melds into the skin. *Price point: About $7.*
    *   **Lips:** Nothing too bold. A sheer, berry-toned balm or lipstick works best. I've been reaching for the **Burt's Bees Tinted Lip Balm in 'Red Dahlia'** or dabbing a tiny bit of the **Flower Beauty Petal Pout Lip Colour in 'Spiced Petal'** (a muted plum) with my finger and blending it out for a stained effect. *Price point: ~$5-10.*
*   **Overall Time Investment:** Around 10-15 minutes, mostly because I’m being extra careful with the blending.

**Real Talk Time:**
My first few attempts at this, particularly with the grey shadows, definitely leaned into ""looking tired"" territory rather than ""effortlessly dreamy."" The biggest lesson was that *blending is paramount*, especially with cooler tones, to avoid any harsh edges that can drag the face down. Also, the choice of a *brown* smudged liner over black made a surprising difference in softening the whole look. It’s wild how much nuance a few simple changes can add to achieving a specific vibe without needing a ton of products or time. For a functionalist aesthetic, precision is key. For reverie escapist, it's about the soft focus.

I woke up with the “twinge” - something I haven’t felt in over a year. I was questioning why. I didn’t eat or drink like crazy for the Super Bowl as in years past (even when my team won last year). pancakes/ hashbrowns with tons of coffee for breakfast. Lunch was a veg soup with crackers. Then pre game snacks - Doritos, chips/salsa, mini tacos from the freezer and buffalo cauliflower bites. I made a vodka tonic that was consumed with most of that, then an IPA beer with a pretty basic cheese hoagie. Stuff I eat and drink all the time, besides the vodka. Rarely liquor but a few beers a week is common. Dessert was a simple yellow cake and ice cream. 

Did I not have enough water? Too much variety in food and drink? This morning I figured I’ll have a BM and things will improve. 1, 2, 3 of those and the feeling remains. I had my normal amount of coffee, made a protein shake around 2pm that I drank until 6, and just had some of the soup. 

Hopefully tomorrow the pains gone. I probably won’t eat anything other than another afternoon shake. I don’t like starving myself and losing weight from this but the other option is potentially being hospitalized. ",1,1770686146.0,Diverticulitis,1,1.0,False

As a first time business owner, what are some ideas you think would work for the storefront that I could reasonably start? Any better ideas on how to find solid renters?

Here are some details:
-There are already 4 coffee shops within a 3 block radius.
-The first floor is a shared space, it has a salon in the back, a private office space, then what I am calling the storefront which includes the following:

This is the last time I will be saying these so I request you to please go through this with an open heart. I will keep it short. 

I want to thank you for being my best friend, all the small and big efforts and all the love and goodness you’ve poured in my life. I am grateful for everything. 

I want to apologise for all my wrongdoings, all the times you were hurt because of me. There is no justification or explanation. I say this with utmost sincerity, pain, and regret. 

I can sense a lot of anger, bitterness, grudge in your words towards me these days. And you have all the rights to feel like that. But I hope someday you can let these go completely and forgive me.

You said you’ve become indifferent, but still for one last time I have to say this: the thought that I might never see you again makes my heart bleed. Even though it might not matter to you anymore, I want you to know that I love you with my whole heart, and will always do. All the things I have done wrong resulted from my weaknesses, not from the lack of love. You don’t have to do anything about it. I just want you to know that. Having to stay away from you feels like the punishment for all my sins. My biggest regret in life will always be not being able to show how much you mean to me, and will always mean to me. I don’t have words to express this crippling pain. I hope maybe few years later, I get to see you happy, excelling and thriving in life. Maybe a few years later, when there’s no bitterness left inside, you can tell me about your lovely family and career over a cup of coffee. I will look forward to that. I mean everything I say; please don’t think that after a few days the things I’m saying will become irrelevant to me. 

I can’t and won’t ever be indifferent to you. No matter what. Wherever you are, and whoever you become, you’ll always own a piece of my heart; you’ll always find a friend in me. I know I haven’t been a good partner. But this friend will never turn his back on you, and you will always have me. Till my last breath. Don’t keep even an atom’s level of doubt in it. So if you ever are in trouble or feel lonely, and you don’t know where to go, my doors are always open for you. Just a call or text or just give me a sign, I will be there. 

I pray that God fills your heart and life with love, fulfilment, peace and prosperity. Your happiness makes me happy. Your sadness makes me sad. I am really happy for you. I am glad that you found someone. 

Lastly, I want to say: \*\***يقبرني**\*\*

1r0mojn,https://i.redd.it/vuadtqcshkig1.jpeg,How I got my result with 10 days of studying,"
Used Cambridge General IELTs books 17, 19 and 20. I found that my main weaknesses were writing and speaking. So I focused on them. 

I was ok with the part 1 writing (writing a letter). The part 2 I struggled with, I haven't done essay writing in 20 years. There's a format that you should follow- I watched a few videos from Fast track Ielts and paid for her course- I watched her writing part 2 section and speaking only. Keep sentences short and not too complex. Use a few linkers here and there. Use relevant language for your topic case. I'm really bad at writing and forming sentences so this surprised me . 

When having my writing marked I used perplexity and chatgp , they both give you lower marks than reality. 

During my writing paper I had to use the toilet twice so I couldn't finish properly. I spent too much time on part 1 writing (20mins). Try to spend 15 mins tops for part 1. 

For the reading part, make sure to go back and check your answers, I corrected 2 answers. 

For speaking, I used chatgp to practice, but it was pretty shite. I am south Asian, and English was my 2nd language but grew up in England. The most important thing (to me anyway) is showing confidence. You are not giving a presentation, you are having a conversation. Be yourself, smile and blabber away. 

For my specific situation, I needed 6.5 for each domain.

Other than that, drink plenty the night before and on the day. Avoid coffee and heavy meals on the day. Try to stay calm and practice some breathing exercises. I don't think it's worth doing last minute studying on exam day, saw a few others doing that but I think that'd stress me out.

It was a cartoon picture of me holding a coffee cup (I used to be a barista and have been out of that industry for over 2 years) and it was clearly made with one of my selfies. I have been against AI for a long time, and ever since I did thorough research on how damaging it is, and how it can own whatever information you give the bots, and re-use your features in other conversations/servers, I have been extremely careful about NOT giving it anything.

So when my friend sent me this, she expected me probably to be impressed or flattered by it, but i was extremely uncomfortable by multiple things.

One, why is there a photo of me on your phone? We barely see each other IRL, and when we do hangout, we never take pictures together, so I know it was a standalone selfie from one of my pages screenshotted and/or saved. We mainly play games with each other online and interact on social media.

Two, why are you writing specific prompts with my photos randomly? I get there are AI trends going on right now, but i never expressed a need to be involved.

When this was addressed, it was brushed under the rug and I was seen as someone who was overreacting. When i addressed it, I made it clear that it made me feel gross, worried and also just kind of like a prop because she ignored that I hate AI and have been very vocal about it to everyone.

Am I Overreacting? I keep questioning if i'm just being mean, sensitive or if i have valid reason to be upset.

I came here, last year, to pursue a master's program at the university. I came as an international student. In the beginning, I found coping up with things very difficult. Coming to a new country from a completely different part of the world was intimidating at first. I used to miss my family alot. Got my first job of my life here in windsor after a month. Thanks to the people who gave me a chance. Windsor and it's people were kind to me. I'll be graduating in a few months. When I look back, I see my journey. 
I still remember calling my mom on the 10th day after I came here and I was like ""hey mom, i dont know how to make tea or coffee. I've been eating out from the past few days."" And she blasted at me for not taking care of myself. Honestly, I didn't know how to cook cuz I was so pampered. Time is a great healer. Now I can cook well. Not only that, I adjusted this new climate and culture. People here are so polite and nice. 

Moving to a new country comes with excitement and a lot of unknowns. When I came to Windsor, I didn’t know what to expec but what I found was kindness in the smallest moments.
From people patiently helping me when I was confused, to simple conversations that made hard days easier, Windsor slowly started feeling less like a new place and more like home. There were days when a smile from a stranger, a short chat at work or in class, or someone simply being understanding meant more than they probably realized.
As an immigrant, you remember these moments. You remember who made things easier when everything felt overwhelming. And Windsor gave me many of those moments.
This post is just to say thank you.
Thank you for the warmth, the patience, and the quiet support.

She pulled back the second she saw me. He didn't look at her, just kept staring at his cup like he wanted to disappear into it. I walked right up to their table and sat down without asking. My sister opened her mouth but I cut her off.

""Don't,"" I said.

She tried anyway. ""We were just talking.""

""About what? How you spent my wedding fund on bottle service and blackjack?"" I looked at him. ""Did she tell you she paid me back yet?""

His jaw tightened. ""She said she was working on it.""

""She's been working on it for six months."" I pulled out my phone and showed him the screenshots I'd saved. Bank statements. Venmo requests I'd sent that she left on read. Text messages where she promised next week, next month, after her bonus. ""Your fiance owes me eight thousand dollars. She stole it from the joint account my parents set up for my wedding. Took every penny the day after I told her I was engaged.""

My sister's face went red. ""You're such a bitch. You ruined my life over money.""

""You ruined your own life. I just showed people the receipts.""

He stood up so fast his chair scraped the floor. ""I need to go.""

My sister grabbed his wrist. ""Please, just give me another chance. We can fix this.""

""There's nothing to fix."" He pulled away from her and walked out.

She turned on me the second he was gone. ""This is all your fault. We were actually making progress until you showed up.""

""Progress toward what? You getting another ring you can't afford?""

""He loves me.""

""He loved who he thought you were. The version that didn't steal from family."" I leaned back. ""Why were you even meeting with him?""

""Because I wanted to explain. To tell him the truth about what happened.""

""The truth is you took my money and blew it in Vegas. What else is there?""

She looked down at her coffee. ""I was going to pay you back. I really was. But then I lost my job and everything fell apart and I thought if I could just talk to him, maybe he'd understand.""

""Understand what? That you're a thief?""

""I made a mistake.""

""You made a choice."" I stood up. ""And you're still making choices. You're sitting here trying to manipulate him instead of getting a job and paying me back.""

""I have a job.""

""Since when?""

""Two weeks ago. Retail. It doesn't pay much but it's something.""

I didn't believe her. ""Where?""

She named a store in the mall. I made a mental note to drive by and check if she was lying.

""I'm paying you back twenty dollars a week,"" she said. ""I already sent the first payment.""

I checked my Venmo. She had. Twenty dollars with a note that said ""week 1 of 400.""

""Four hundred weeks is almost eight years,"" I said.

""I'm doing what I can.""

""You could sell the designer bags you bought in Vegas. The shoes. The watch.""

""I already sold most of it.""

""Then where's the money?""

She didn't answer.

I knew where it went. Rent, probably. Or her car payment. She'd always been terrible with money, always living like she made twice what she actually did. Our parents enabled it for years, bailing her out every time she overdrafted or maxed out a credit card. They probably would have covered the eight grand too if I hadn't made it public.

""I'm trying,"" she said quietly. ""I know you don't believe me but I am.""

""Trying isn't good enough. You destroyed your own engagement because you couldn't stop lying. You stole from me and then acted like I was the villain for exposing you. And now you're sitting here playing the victim like any of this is my fault.""

""I said I was sorry.""

""No you didn't. Not once. You've never actually apologized.""

She looked up at me. Her eyes were wet but I didn't feel bad. ""I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry I took your money. I'm sorry I lied. I'm sorry I ruined everything.""

""You're sorry you got caught.""

""That's not fair.""

""Fair would have been you asking to borrow the money instead of stealing it. Fair would have been you paying me back before you got engaged. Fair would have been you taking responsibility instead of begging Mom and Dad to make me forgive you.""

She wiped her eyes. ""What do you want from me?""

""I want my money back. All of it. And I want you to stop acting like I'm the one who wronged you.""

""Fine. I'll pay you back. Every cent. But it's going to take time.""

""Then I guess you better get used to working retail.""

I left her sitting there and walked home. My phone started buzzing before I even made it to my building. My mom, calling for the third time this week. I didn't answer. She'd just tell me I was being too hard on my sister, that family forgives family, that I should let it go. Same thing she'd been saying since the engagement fell apart.

But I didn't feel like letting it go. My sister stole from me, lied about it, and only started paying me back when she realized her ex might actually take her back if she could prove she'd changed. And even then, twenty dollars a week was insulting. At that rate I'd be forty before I saw the full amount.

I thought about the toast I gave at her engagement party. The looks on everyone's faces when I pulled up the photos of her in Vegas. The receipts for bottle service, the casino chips, the designer shopping bags. Her fiance going pale and then red and then walking out without saying a word. My parents trying to damage control, my sister screaming at me in the parking lot, my mom crying and asking how I could do this to family.

I didn't regret it. Not even a little.

But sometimes I wondered if I went too far. If I should have just confronted her privately instead of humiliating her in front of everyone. If there was a way to get my money back without destroying her relationship.

Then I remembered her hand on his arm at the coffee shop. The way she tried to lie even when I had proof. The fact that she still hadn't really apologized, just said the words because I cornered her.

Should I have handled this differently?

Hey,

I know this is a long shot and I don’t really have expectations, but I’m curious to see what happens after posting here :)

I’m married (over 8 years) and have been ENM for about 4 years now. It’s definitely had its ups and downs, but overall it’s been a positive experience that’s helped me grow a lot. I’m mostly looking for a friendship with a woman in a similar situation—someone who gets the lifestyle, the nuance, and the importance of honesty. I really enjoy connecting with people who are thoughtful, open-minded, and genuine, and I’m curious about friendships that have a playful, flirty energy too 😏.

A bit about me: I’m very into science, love wandering through art exhibitions, enjoy hiking and bodyboarding, and I’m always down for a cute coffee date or cozy night with good conversation. I’m also really into tarot—so if you like exploring the intuitive side of things, that’s a bonus.

He can be included if you want but doesn't have to 🔥It's totally up to you.

If any of this resonates with you, and you’re 25+ and in my area (and able to verify), feel free to send me a chat request. Would love to see if there’s a natural vibe ❤️",1,1770685225.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

It's mostly around my midsection, but my hips and thighs are bigger too. I changed my diet and increased my exercise, but it's been several months and it hasn't seemed to make a difference. 

I mentioned the weight gain to my oncologist at my last appointment and he brushed it off saying I was getting older and couldn't eat the way I used to. But this is triggering an eating disorder that I've worked hard to overcome and never told anyone about. I've been cutting out more and more and it's not going in a good direction. Today I ate a tablespoon of hummus and six Ritz crackers plus a cup of coffee and a bunch of water. All I can think about is my weight. I know this is unhealthy, but I feel so bad that I'm desperate and reverting to old habits.

I really don't want to have to confess any of this to my husband of health care team. Anyone else been in a similar situation?",2,1770685200.0,breastcancer,2,1.0,False

Listed under ""Her husband's lies"" loving the cheating stories at the mo, not so much 2nd chances unless it was a one time slip. I like the MFC to up and find love?","I witnessed my husband ejaculate inside another woman.
He looked me in the eyes and lied... every single time recently.
The earring that wasn't mine. The perfume cling to his shirt. The hotel receipts. The phone that buzzed with her name.
""You're being paranoid, love.""
His voice was velvet. Always velvet.
""I'd burn the world down before I hurt you.""
I believed it...
I told myself I was still the woman he chose.
But deep in my chest, something small and sharp.
Until the night I came home early.
The bedroom door wasn't locked. I pushed.
Callum. Another woman.
Our sheets twisted around their bodies like they belonged there.
He froze mid-thrust.
Looked straight into my eyes over her bare shoulder.
For one perfect, shattering second, I saw the real him:
wide-eyed panic, mouth open, no lie ready yet.
I just... turned.
Walked out of the room.
Out of the flat.
Out of the life I'd spent years building around a man who never deserved the blueprints.
————————
The dining room smelled of rosemary-roasted lamb and expensive red wine.
Candles flickered in silver holders, casting soft gold across the faces of our friends.
Laughter bounced off the exposed brick walls of our Leslieville flat, the kind of warm, easy sound that made strangers stop and stare through the window on summer evenings.
Tonight was no different. Tonight we were flawless.
I stood at the head of the table in the emerald dress Callum had bought me last month, the one that hugged my hips exactly the way he liked.
My hair was swept into a loose chignon, makeup subtle but perfect red lips, winged liner, the look he always called ""dangerous.""
I felt dangerous tonight.
Or maybe I just wanted to.
""Honestly, you two are disgusting,"" Lena teased from across the table, raising her glass. ""How are you still this in love after five years? It's unfair.""
Callum's arm slid around my waist from behind. His fingers splayed possessively across my stomach, thumb brushing the silk of my dress in slow circles. He pressed a pecking to my temple, lingering just long enough for everyone to see.
""What can I say?"" he murmured, loud enough for the table to hear. ""I married up. Way up.""
The room erupted in awws and mock groans. Someone yelled, ""Get a room!"" Someone else shouted, ""You already have one use it!""
I laughed on cue, tilting my head back against his shoulder.
His cologne wrapped around me cedar and bergamot, familiar, comforting. For a moment I let myself sink into it. Let myself believe this was still real.
Maisie leaned forward, chin on her hand, eyes sparkling with wine and mischief. ""Spill, Isla. What's the secret? How do you keep him this whipped?""
I glanced upat Callum.
He was smiling down at me, hazel eyes soft in the candlelight, the same eyes that had looked at me like I hung the moon the night he proposed under the CN Tower fireworks.
The same eyes that had once promised forever without hesitation.
I smiled back. ""I just let him think he's in charge.""
The table roared. Callum laughed too, deep and genuine, and squeezed me tighter. ""She's lying,"" he said. ""She's the boss. Always has been.""
More cheers. More toasts. More compliments about how we were ""goals,"" how we made marriage look easy, how we were proof that true love still existed in this cynical city.
I raised my glass with them, cheeks warm from wine and praise.
Inside, something small and sharp twisted.
Because earlier that evening, while I was setting the table, his phone had buzzed on the kitchen counter. Once.
Twice.
Three times in quick succession.
I hadn't looked.
Not really.
But the screen had lit up long enough for me to see the name.
Nadia.
And the preview text that flashed before the screen timed out:
Can't stop thinking about last night...
I'd turned away.
Told myself it was work.
Told myself I was being ridiculous.
Now, with his arm around me and our friends cheering, I felt the twist again. Sharper.
Callum's phone was in his pocket now. I could feel it pressing against my hip through the thin fabric of his trousers.
Every time it vibrated, his body tensed just a fraction, barely noticeable unless you were pressed against him the way I was.
I pretended not to notice.
The conversation shifted to Lena's new promotion. Then to Maisie's disastrous blind date.
Then to someone's upcoming trip to Montreal. Laughter rolled over the table like waves.
Callum excused himself quietly. ""Need to grab another bottle from the cellar.""
He pecked my cheek before he left soft, lingering, the way he always did when people were watching.
I watched him disappear down the hallway toward the basement stairs.
The table kept talking. I kept smiling. Nodding. Laughing at the right moments.
But my mind was on the phone in his pocket.
On the name that kept lighting up his screen.
On the way his thumb had brushed my stomach earlier like a reflex, like habit, like he was reminding himself I was still here.
He returned a minute later with a fresh bottle of Cabernet. Popped the cork with practiced ease. Poured for everyone.
When he reached me, he leaned down, lips brushing my ear.
""You okay, love?"" he whispered. ""You've been quiet.""
I turned my face toward him. Our noses almost touched.
""Just thinking how lucky I am,"" I said.
His eyes searched mine for a second longer than usual. Then he smiled slow, warm, devastating.
""Me too.""
He pecked me then. Right there in front of everyone. Slow. Deep. The kind of pecking that made Lena whistle and Maisie fake-gag.
When he pulled back, his thumb traced my bottom lip.
""Forever, yeah?"" he murmured, just for me.
I nodded.
""Forever.""
The word tasted like ash on my tongue.
Later, after the last guest left and the dishes were stacked in the sink, we stood in the quiet kitchen.
Callum wrapped his arms around me from behind. Chin on my shoulder.
Breath warm against my neck.
""Great night,"" he said. ""You were perfect.""
I leaned back into him.
Let him hold me.
His phone buzzed again on the counter.
He didn't move to check it.
I did.
I reached over, casual, like I was just moving it out of the way.
The screen lit up.
Nadia again.
Miss you already.
When can I steal you again? :peck:
My stomach dropped.
Callum's arms tightened around me. ""Leave it,"" he said softly. ""Work can wait till morning.""
I stared at the message for one more heartbeat.
Then I flipped the phone face-down.
""Of course,"" I said.
He pecked my neck. ""Let's go to bed.""
I let him lead me down the hallway.
Let him undress me slowly.
Let him makelove to me like nothing was wrong.
And when he fell asleep beside me, arm slung possessively over my waist, I stared at the ceiling in the dark.
The city lights flickered through the blinds.
I told myself it was nothing.
I told myself I was tired.
I told myself we were still perfect.
But deep in my chest, something small and sharp refused to believe the lie anymore.
And it was only getting louder.
.....
The morning after the dinner party, the flat still smelled faintly of rosemary and wine.
Sunlight slanted through the blinds in sharp golden bars across the hardwood floor, catching dust motes that danced like tiny secrets.
I stood in the kitchen in Callum's oversized T-shirt, barefoot, hair tangled from sleep, making coffee the way we always did his black, mine with a splash of oat milk and too much sugar.
He came up behind me, arms sliding around my waist, chin resting on my shoulder.
His stubble scratched softly against my neck.
""Morning, beautiful,"" he murmured, voice still rough from sleep.
He pecked the spot just below my ear, the one that always made me shiver.
""Morning,"" I said, smiling despite the small knot that had settled in my chest overnight.
I handed him his mug.
He took it, fingers brushing mine deliberately, lingering.
""You were incredible last night,"" he said. ""Everyone kept saying how lucky I am.""
I turned in his arms, leaning back against the counter.
""They say that because they're jealous.""
He grinned, that boyish, devastating grin that had first hooked me five years ago at that expat mixer in Toronto. ""Or because it's true.""
He leaned in to peck me slow, lazy, tasting of toothpaste and last night's wine.
I pecked him back, letting my hands slide up his chest, feeling the steady thump of his heart under my palms.
For a moment, everything felt right again.
The way it used to.
Then his phone buzzed on the counter behind me.
Once. Twice.
He didn't pull away immediately.
The third buzz made him sigh against my mouth. ""Sorry, love. Probably the office.""
He reached past me, picked up the phone, glanced at the screen.
His thumb hovered for a second too long.
I saw the name flash before he tilted the phone away.
Nadia.
My stomach gave a small, sick twist.
He swiped to silence it, set the phone face-down.
""Everything okay?"" I asked, keeping my voice light.
""Just work stuff."" He smiled, but it didn't quite reach his eyes. ""Nothing that can't wait till Monday.""
He pecked me again quicker this time, almost distracted then stepped back.
""I'll grab a shower. Join me?""
I shook my head. ""I've got a deadline. Illustration proofs due by noon.""
He pouted playfully. ""Cruel woman.""
He disappeared down the hallway, leaving me alone with the coffee and the quiet.
I stared at his phone.
Face-down. Silent now.
I told myself not to.
Then I reached for it anyway.
The screen was locked, of course. But the notification bar still showed the preview of the last message.
Nadia: Last night was fun. When can we do it again? :smiling_imp:
My breath caught.
Fun.
Do it again.
The words burned behind my eyes.
I set the phone back down exactly as it was. Hands shaking.
When Callum came out of the shower ten minutes later, towel slung low on his hips, hair damp and curling at the ends, I was already at the kitchen
table with my tablet open, pretending to work.
He walked over, leaned down, pecked the top of my head.
""Love you,"" he said casually.
I looked up at him. Those hazel eyes clear, warm, familiar.
""Love you too,"" I said.
And I meant it.
Even as something inside me cracked, just a hairline fracture, barely visible.
He dressed for the office tailored navy suit, crisp white shirt, tie the color of midnight.
He looked every inch the successful marketing executive.
The man I'd moved continents for.
He grabbed his coat from the hook by the door.
I watched him shrug it on.
And that's when I saw it.
A small silver hoop earring caught in the lining of the breasts pocket. It glinted in the sunlight like a tiny accusation.
My heart stuttered.
Callum didn't notice.
He leaned down, pecked me goodbye quick, familiar.
""See you tonight?"" he asked.
""Yeah,"" I whispered.
He left.
The door clicked shut.
I sat there for a long minute, staring at the empty space where he'd been.
Then I stood.
Walked to the coat rack.
Lifted the coat.
Pulled the earring free.
It was delicate. Expensive. Not my style at all.
I turned it over in my palm.
No engraving. No clue.
But it wasn't mine.
I closed my fingers around it until the metal bit into my skin.
.....
When he came home that evening, I was waiting.
I'd set the table for two simple pasta, salad, the bottle of red left over from last night.
He walked in smiling, loosening his tie.
""Smells amazing,"" he said, dropping his briefcase by the door.
He came straight to me, wrapped his arms around my waist from behind as I stirred the sauce.
I turned in his hold, holding up the earring between my fingers.
""What's this?""
He blinked.
Then his face smoothed over smooth as glass.
""Oh,"" he said lightly. ""Must have picked it up at the dry cleaners.
They mix things up sometimes.""
He reached for it.
I pulled my hand back.
""Dry cleaners don't put earrings in coat pockets, Callum.""
His smile faltered just for a second.
Then he laughed softly, almost fondly.
""Love, come on.
You're being ridiculous.""
He stepped closer, took my hand gently, pried my fingers open.
The earring lay in my palm like evidence.
He plucked it out, held it up to the light.
""See? Cheap. Probably some intern's. I'll return it Monday.""
He set it on the counter.
Then cupped my face with both hands.
""Look at me.""
I did.
Those hazel eyes steady, sincere.
""I love you, Isla. Only you. You know that, right?""
His thumbs stroked my cheekbones.
""I'd never do anything to hurt you.""
The words were soft.
Convincing.
Almost perfect.
I searched his face for the lie.
I couldn't find it.
Not yet.
So I nodded.
""Okay.""
He smiled relieved, warm.
He pecked me then slow, deep, reassuring.
When he pulled back, he rested his forehead against mine.
""We're good, yeah?""
""Yeah,"" I whispered.
He took my hand, led me to the table.
We ate.
We talked about nothing his day, my illustration deadline, weekend plans.
We laughed.
We pecked over the dishes.
Later, in bed, he held me close, fingers tracing lazy circles on my back.
I lay awake long after his breathing evened out.
The earring sat on the nightstand now small, silver, silent.
I stared at it in the dark.
Told myself it was nothing.
Told myself I was paranoid.
Told myself we were still perfect.
But the crack in my chest had widened.
Just a little.
Just enough to let the first real doubt slip through.
And once it was in, it refused to leave.",1,1770685148.0,romancenovels,2,1.0,False

1r0mfdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlesheets/comments/1r0mfdj/want_to_autogenerate_table_based_on_data_in/,Want to auto-generate table based on data in another tab - reading stats,"Hello! I'm still learning lots about Google Sheets/Excel so please be gentle with me if this is an easy fix! I am also not an active Reddit user, so please let me know if anything needs to be changed about my post.

I am in the process of creating a really robust reading tracker since I love to read and love to see my stats. Kind of similar to Spotify Wrapped, but for my reading for the year (yes, I know there are apps, I don't like any of them). 

I would like, within my Stats tab, to know how to generate a table of my most-read authors for the year, akin to what I see when I click on Column Stats. I'm not sure what the formulation for this would be. My 2025 tab is finished, so I'm not adding data to it, but is there a way for the table for 2026 to auto-populate when I add another author to my list of read books?

Please let me know if this doesn't make any sense and I will do my best to explain a bit more. So far I know how to use SUMIFS and COUNTIFS pretty comfortably, but my skill is... limited beyond that. I've added photos for reference. Any help would be much appreciated!!

  
What I want the table to look like (auto-generated if possible):

https://preview.redd.it/juhvw7saekig1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=29aa7360c72d8bfc64f2f897d63def1d88abcbe3

https://preview.redd.it/kk7532rgekig1.png?width=1871&format=png&auto=webp&s=a31bab19bf20c21d300d56139d24a19a842f4e46

Something like this chart, but in table format, and in my Stats tab. Would also like to make one for my in-progress 2026 reading that will update itself as I add more to my reading log. Bonus points if you can tell me how to only include finished books and exclude books in progress!

1r0meyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/1r0meyi/software_engineer_7_yoe_seeking_a/,"Software Engineer (7 YoE) seeking a ""swiss-sustainable"" remote/freelance/entrepreneur path. Is it doable?","Ciao r/askswitzerland,

I’m trying to reach out to the freelancers, digital nomads, and career-shifters here for some perspective or at least I think I try to.   
I’m a swiss citizen and software engineer (7 years total experience, 4 years w/o apprenticeship).

# Context

I recently returned to Switzerland after 27 months of full-time travel across asia and oceania (AUS/NZ). Coming back mid-summer during the ramp up of the global tech layoff cycle was super hard (and still is), but it also showed me a deeper internal mismatch with the environment and myself.   
I was also diagnosed with ADHD years ago, but it wasn't until I was traveling that I realized how much my nervous system relies on the right environment to be regulated.

While I'm grateful to be born here and for the ""swiss clockwork"" and the stability of our system, I realized that the highly structured, rigid ""home-work-home"" rhythm and the grey winter in the Mittelland is quite draining for me personally. I thrive in more spontaneous, high-context, and socially permeable environments, where joining a ""Verein"" or similar formal bodies don't have to be a prerequisite.

# What I aim for

I’m probably emigrating for the next 2–20 years (likely back to asia), but I want to do this in a way that I don't lose my base here, meaning that I want to remain financially stable, maintain my swiss anchors, and ensure I’m not sabotaging my retirement (AHV/Pillar 3a) in 30+ years if I may actually decide to return.

My SWE background is primarily in Java/Spring Boot and DevOps with some Angular sprinkled in, so the basic stack if relevant.   
I’m a system thinker, meaning that I love building resilient systems, but struggle with implicit rules or heavy office politics. I'm also rather bad with the semantic-knowledge in form of interview, since I internalize knowledge rather than binding it to buzzwords, but shine when there's a need to pull off something from thin air. I'm thinking about trying to build an income stream via marketplace extensions like Shopify or similar, but I know it could take years or never work out. I'm also interested in pen-testing, but it's a switch that would take years, so I put it off for now, since my situation is more than just unstable.   
My ""idol"" is Pieter Levels, since he maximized autonomy in his lifestyle, without all the meetings and clients. I don't even care about earning more than 8k a month after social taxes, but it's a nice bonus.

I’m significantly more productive in asynchronous, WFH, or location-independent setups, since I can choose my environment, so it works for me and not against me. I had specific cafes I worked on private projects in all during travels. Bruce Coffee in Nongkhai or MIRK in Da Lat are two examples so cheers to those two. 

There are some challenges I face with that wish which are:

1. The ""Swiss Tax"": Surviving here while transitioning to a remote/freelance setup is brutal. Taking a remote job from a German/European company often doesn't pay enough to cover swiss cost-of-living (CoL) during the months I’m actually here visiting family or preparing to leave, which could still take months from now, since the economic situation completely demolished me.
2. ""Contract Lock"": I don’t want to sign a traditional 80%-100% contract just to quit in 4 months. It feels unfair to the employer and looks bad on the CV, especially here where linear CVs are preferred. I also need to plan in, that my plan fails and I want or need to return, without destroying my whole life and chances in life.
3. Retirement: I worry about gaps in my AHV, which I plan to retroactively close, and not being able to fund a swiss-standard retirement if I’m earning ""local"" rates abroad if I plan to come back when older.

My Questions for the experienced/freelancers/people that broke out of the traditional way:

* ""Arbeitnehmende ohne beitragspflichtigen Arbeitgeber"" (ANobAG) or freelance? For those working for foreign companies while residing here, how do you handle the administration/taxes? Is it better to go the ANobAG route or set up a [sole proprietorship](https://www.kmu.admin.ch/kmu/en/home/concrete-know-how/setting-up-sme/starting-business/choosing-legal-structure/sole-proprietorship.html)? I always read that this is one of the biggest issues.
* Predictable async/remote income?: Aside from the usual platforms like Upwork, which are littered with slop postings, are there specific platforms or niches where a swiss-based dev could find high-value, asynchronous work that respects a ""task-based"" rather than ""presence-based"" approach? The market seems heavily oversaturated right now. (I've looked into AI training/RLHF, but the weakening USD/CHF exchange rate makes it a tough primary income (40$/hour) and it's definitely not a long-term solution).
* Client Acquisition?: For those who made the change to freelancing/entrepreneurship or anything that relies on clients without prior experience, how did you land your first ""swiss-rate"" remote mandates and how did you handle contracts and always delivering high quality?
* Retirement Strategy: How do you handle your 2nd and 3rd pillars when you aren't tied to a traditional swiss employer? I know one can pay into them themselves, but it seems a bit hard with a low local salary from abroad. 

I’m not looking to escape responsibility in form of that everyone has to work, but I’m genuinely looking for a way to work and live that is sustainable for my brain while keeping my connection to Switzerland intact. It doesn't make sense to break apart here, nor to throw everything away.   
  
I’d appreciate any roadmaps, advice on (legal) setups, or even just some empathy from anyone who has felt like they don't belong, despite our otherwise almost perfect system.

Mercii vielmals!

Its listed as ""Her husband's lies"" im loving the cheating books at tge mo but not tge 2nd chance ones if the affair had been an ongoing choice for months","I witnessed my husband ejaculate inside another woman.
He looked me in the eyes and lied... every single time recently.
The earring that wasn't mine. The perfume cling to his shirt. The hotel receipts. The phone that buzzed with her name.
""You're being paranoid, love.""
His voice was velvet. Always velvet.
""I'd burn the world down before I hurt you.""
I believed it...
I told myself I was still the woman he chose.
But deep in my chest, something small and sharp.
Until the night I came home early.
The bedroom door wasn't locked. I pushed.
Callum. Another woman.
Our sheets twisted around their bodies like they belonged there.
He froze mid-thrust.
Looked straight into my eyes over her bare shoulder.
For one perfect, shattering second, I saw the real him:
wide-eyed panic, mouth open, no lie ready yet.
I just... turned.
Walked out of the room.
Out of the flat.
Out of the life I'd spent years building around a man who never deserved the blueprints.
————————
The dining room smelled of rosemary-roasted lamb and expensive red wine.
Candles flickered in silver holders, casting soft gold across the faces of our friends.
Laughter bounced off the exposed brick walls of our Leslieville flat, the kind of warm, easy sound that made strangers stop and stare through the window on summer evenings.
Tonight was no different. Tonight we were flawless.
I stood at the head of the table in the emerald dress Callum had bought me last month, the one that hugged my hips exactly the way he liked.
My hair was swept into a loose chignon, makeup subtle but perfect red lips, winged liner, the look he always called ""dangerous.""
I felt dangerous tonight.
Or maybe I just wanted to.
""Honestly, you two are disgusting,"" Lena teased from across the table, raising her glass. ""How are you still this in love after five years? It's unfair.""
Callum's arm slid around my waist from behind. His fingers splayed possessively across my stomach, thumb brushing the silk of my dress in slow circles. He pressed a pecking to my temple, lingering just long enough for everyone to see.
""What can I say?"" he murmured, loud enough for the table to hear. ""I married up. Way up.""
The room erupted in awws and mock groans. Someone yelled, ""Get a room!"" Someone else shouted, ""You already have one use it!""
I laughed on cue, tilting my head back against his shoulder.
His cologne wrapped around me cedar and bergamot, familiar, comforting. For a moment I let myself sink into it. Let myself believe this was still real.
Maisie leaned forward, chin on her hand, eyes sparkling with wine and mischief. ""Spill, Isla. What's the secret? How do you keep him this whipped?""
I glanced upat Callum.
He was smiling down at me, hazel eyes soft in the candlelight, the same eyes that had looked at me like I hung the moon the night he proposed under the CN Tower fireworks.
The same eyes that had once promised forever without hesitation.
I smiled back. ""I just let him think he's in charge.""
The table roared. Callum laughed too, deep and genuine, and squeezed me tighter. ""She's lying,"" he said. ""She's the boss. Always has been.""
More cheers. More toasts. More compliments about how we were ""goals,"" how we made marriage look easy, how we were proof that true love still existed in this cynical city.
I raised my glass with them, cheeks warm from wine and praise.
Inside, something small and sharp twisted.
Because earlier that evening, while I was setting the table, his phone had buzzed on the kitchen counter. Once.
Twice.
Three times in quick succession.
I hadn't looked.
Not really.
But the screen had lit up long enough for me to see the name.
Nadia.
And the preview text that flashed before the screen timed out:
Can't stop thinking about last night...
I'd turned away.
Told myself it was work.
Told myself I was being ridiculous.
Now, with his arm around me and our friends cheering, I felt the twist again. Sharper.
Callum's phone was in his pocket now. I could feel it pressing against my hip through the thin fabric of his trousers.
Every time it vibrated, his body tensed just a fraction, barely noticeable unless you were pressed against him the way I was.
I pretended not to notice.
The conversation shifted to Lena's new promotion. Then to Maisie's disastrous blind date.
Then to someone's upcoming trip to Montreal. Laughter rolled over the table like waves.
Callum excused himself quietly. ""Need to grab another bottle from the cellar.""
He pecked my cheek before he left soft, lingering, the way he always did when people were watching.
I watched him disappear down the hallway toward the basement stairs.
The table kept talking. I kept smiling. Nodding. Laughing at the right moments.
But my mind was on the phone in his pocket.
On the name that kept lighting up his screen.
On the way his thumb had brushed my stomach earlier like a reflex, like habit, like he was reminding himself I was still here.
He returned a minute later with a fresh bottle of Cabernet. Popped the cork with practiced ease. Poured for everyone.
When he reached me, he leaned down, lips brushing my ear.
""You okay, love?"" he whispered. ""You've been quiet.""
I turned my face toward him. Our noses almost touched.
""Just thinking how lucky I am,"" I said.
His eyes searched mine for a second longer than usual. Then he smiled slow, warm, devastating.
""Me too.""
He pecked me then. Right there in front of everyone. Slow. Deep. The kind of pecking that made Lena whistle and Maisie fake-gag.
When he pulled back, his thumb traced my bottom lip.
""Forever, yeah?"" he murmured, just for me.
I nodded.
""Forever.""
The word tasted like ash on my tongue.
Later, after the last guest left and the dishes were stacked in the sink, we stood in the quiet kitchen.
Callum wrapped his arms around me from behind. Chin on my shoulder.
Breath warm against my neck.
""Great night,"" he said. ""You were perfect.""
I leaned back into him.
Let him hold me.
His phone buzzed again on the counter.
He didn't move to check it.
I did.
I reached over, casual, like I was just moving it out of the way.
The screen lit up.
Nadia again.
Miss you already.
When can I steal you again? :peck:
My stomach dropped.
Callum's arms tightened around me. ""Leave it,"" he said softly. ""Work can wait till morning.""
I stared at the message for one more heartbeat.
Then I flipped the phone face-down.
""Of course,"" I said.
He pecked my neck. ""Let's go to bed.""
I let him lead me down the hallway.
Let him undress me slowly.
Let him makelove to me like nothing was wrong.
And when he fell asleep beside me, arm slung possessively over my waist, I stared at the ceiling in the dark.
The city lights flickered through the blinds.
I told myself it was nothing.
I told myself I was tired.
I told myself we were still perfect.
But deep in my chest, something small and sharp refused to believe the lie anymore.
And it was only getting louder.
.....
The morning after the dinner party, the flat still smelled faintly of rosemary and wine.
Sunlight slanted through the blinds in sharp golden bars across the hardwood floor, catching dust motes that danced like tiny secrets.
I stood in the kitchen in Callum's oversized T-shirt, barefoot, hair tangled from sleep, making coffee the way we always did his black, mine with a splash of oat milk and too much sugar.
He came up behind me, arms sliding around my waist, chin resting on my shoulder.
His stubble scratched softly against my neck.
""Morning, beautiful,"" he murmured, voice still rough from sleep.
He pecked the spot just below my ear, the one that always made me shiver.
""Morning,"" I said, smiling despite the small knot that had settled in my chest overnight.
I handed him his mug.
He took it, fingers brushing mine deliberately, lingering.
""You were incredible last night,"" he said. ""Everyone kept saying how lucky I am.""
I turned in his arms, leaning back against the counter.
""They say that because they're jealous.""
He grinned, that boyish, devastating grin that had first hooked me five years ago at that expat mixer in Toronto. ""Or because it's true.""
He leaned in to peck me slow, lazy, tasting of toothpaste and last night's wine.
I pecked him back, letting my hands slide up his chest, feeling the steady thump of his heart under my palms.
For a moment, everything felt right again.
The way it used to.
Then his phone buzzed on the counter behind me.
Once. Twice.
He didn't pull away immediately.
The third buzz made him sigh against my mouth. ""Sorry, love. Probably the office.""
He reached past me, picked up the phone, glanced at the screen.
His thumb hovered for a second too long.
I saw the name flash before he tilted the phone away.
Nadia.
My stomach gave a small, sick twist.
He swiped to silence it, set the phone face-down.
""Everything okay?"" I asked, keeping my voice light.
""Just work stuff."" He smiled, but it didn't quite reach his eyes. ""Nothing that can't wait till Monday.""
He pecked me again quicker this time, almost distracted then stepped back.
""I'll grab a shower. Join me?""
I shook my head. ""I've got a deadline. Illustration proofs due by noon.""
He pouted playfully. ""Cruel woman.""
He disappeared down the hallway, leaving me alone with the coffee and the quiet.
I stared at his phone.
Face-down. Silent now.
I told myself not to.
Then I reached for it anyway.
The screen was locked, of course. But the notification bar still showed the preview of the last message.
Nadia: Last night was fun. When can we do it again? :smiling_imp:
My breath caught.
Fun.
Do it again.
The words burned behind my eyes.
I set the phone back down exactly as it was. Hands shaking.
When Callum came out of the shower ten minutes later, towel slung low on his hips, hair damp and curling at the ends, I was already at the kitchen
table with my tablet open, pretending to work.
He walked over, leaned down, pecked the top of my head.
""Love you,"" he said casually.
I looked up at him. Those hazel eyes clear, warm, familiar.
""Love you too,"" I said.
And I meant it.
Even as something inside me cracked, just a hairline fracture, barely visible.
He dressed for the office tailored navy suit, crisp white shirt, tie the color of midnight.
He looked every inch the successful marketing executive.
The man I'd moved continents for.
He grabbed his coat from the hook by the door.
I watched him shrug it on.
And that's when I saw it.
A small silver hoop earring caught in the lining of the breasts pocket. It glinted in the sunlight like a tiny accusation.
My heart stuttered.
Callum didn't notice.
He leaned down, pecked me goodbye quick, familiar.
""See you tonight?"" he asked.
""Yeah,"" I whispered.
He left.
The door clicked shut.
I sat there for a long minute, staring at the empty space where he'd been.
Then I stood.
Walked to the coat rack.
Lifted the coat.
Pulled the earring free.
It was delicate. Expensive. Not my style at all.
I turned it over in my palm.
No engraving. No clue.
But it wasn't mine.
I closed my fingers around it until the metal bit into my skin.
.....
When he came home that evening, I was waiting.
I'd set the table for two simple pasta, salad, the bottle of red left over from last night.
He walked in smiling, loosening his tie.
""Smells amazing,"" he said, dropping his briefcase by the door.
He came straight to me, wrapped his arms around my waist from behind as I stirred the sauce.
I turned in his hold, holding up the earring between my fingers.
""What's this?""
He blinked.
Then his face smoothed over smooth as glass.
""Oh,"" he said lightly. ""Must have picked it up at the dry cleaners.
They mix things up sometimes.""
He reached for it.
I pulled my hand back.
""Dry cleaners don't put earrings in coat pockets, Callum.""
His smile faltered just for a second.
Then he laughed softly, almost fondly.
""Love, come on.
You're being ridiculous.""
He stepped closer, took my hand gently, pried my fingers open.
The earring lay in my palm like evidence.
He plucked it out, held it up to the light.
""See? Cheap. Probably some intern's. I'll return it Monday.""
He set it on the counter.
Then cupped my face with both hands.
""Look at me.""
I did.
Those hazel eyes steady, sincere.
""I love you, Isla. Only you. You know that, right?""
His thumbs stroked my cheekbones.
""I'd never do anything to hurt you.""
The words were soft.
Convincing.
Almost perfect.
I searched his face for the lie.
I couldn't find it.
Not yet.
So I nodded.
""Okay.""
He smiled relieved, warm.
He pecked me then slow, deep, reassuring.
When he pulled back, he rested his forehead against mine.
""We're good, yeah?""
""Yeah,"" I whispered.
He took my hand, led me to the table.
We ate.
We talked about nothing his day, my illustration deadline, weekend plans.
We laughed.
We pecked over the dishes.
Later, in bed, he held me close, fingers tracing lazy circles on my back.
I lay awake long after his breathing evened out.
The earring sat on the nightstand now small, silver, silent.
I stared at it in the dark.
Told myself it was nothing.
Told myself I was paranoid.
Told myself we were still perfect.
But the crack in my chest had widened.
Just a little.
Just enough to let the first real doubt slip through.

I was in search of a fav long forgotten flavored coffee from Godiva. Was on the hunt for either chocolate, hazelnut or caramel. I wasn’t expecting to find it, it had been months since they stocked it, but in we go anyway.. I’m optimistic. 

They didn’t have it.. they had a load of nice looking other type of coffees, but no Godiva. Walking back to the elevator (I don’t bring Finny on the escalator) I glance over at the pots and pans section not expecting to see anything interesting 🤔 but lo and behold (!) I see these guys just sitting there! So there were only three of them just sitting there all by themselves! I look around me. Does anyone see what I’m seeing!? They’re effin gorgeous! And giving them the side eye 👀 I was smitten! 🥰 Three different sizes, created by someone called David Burke. Don’t know who that is, but… gosh, I thought, they’re beautiful 🤩 At first, it looked like a set, but upon closer inspection they weren’t, they were sold individually. 

I thought to myself, nerp! Not today hunny! Was walking  out the door.. stopped, turned round, went back downstairs. Grabbed all three. The damage was less than $90. 

I had to get all three because first of all, I really needed them. What is/was in the kitchen (still haven’t gotten rid of the old stuff yet) is sooo old and terrible looking! We going innnnnn!!! One 7 quart Dutch oven with lid. One 4 qt. Casserole with lid, and one 9.5 inch everyday pan with lid. Heavy bottomed, glass lids trimmed in stainless steel complete with a tiny hole for ventilation 😝 Whaaa?!

Features and benefits: commercial grade heavy gauge stainless steel body. Thicker base for accelerated and even heating. Cast handles are riveted for durability control and safe handling.. oven safe to 500°, dishwasher safe, etc. 

How could I just leave them there! I’m not some who splurges on cookware either! Like I didn’t even google the creators name. All I had to do was inspect them to determine if they were of good quality, and they are! The only downside of them are, the handles and the lid handle get really realllly hot. Hate that. If they had taken the time or consideration to fix that very important issue, it would’ve been chef’s kiss 💋 cookware. I think amazon may carry them if you don’t have a Marshall’s nearby, CK.

This is our second time visiting the city, and I have to say that we kind of enjoyed being regular tourists the first time around - we went on the Ferris wheel, had our fair share of overpriced drinks, and enjoyed a Danube cruise. 

However, we would like our second visit to be a bit more adventurous, as well as more budget-friendly. I would really appreciate some recommendations for alternative pubs, bars, good coffee shops, as well as some cheaper street food places.

I went to high school there, but my mom moved away in 2010, and I haven't been back since. I am sure it has changed in the last decade and a half, and I'm curious about what you'd recommend I do/ see/ eat. I'm into the 4th Ave vibe & natural healing (maybe gem/ stone stores:)

A bit about me, my travel priorities, and things I'm considering doing:

\-Must eat: Mexican food (obviously). I will eat it almost every day, but I don't remember the name of my favorite place(s). Where do you recommend for tamales, chimichangas, tacos? affordable/ street style food is a plus.

\-Sightseeing priorities: nature. I'm coming from a major city & would like to bask in the natural beauty of the desert. I'm considering the botanical gardens, desert museum & Saguaro Nat'l Park, maybe more if I can squeeze it in. My family used to live by Gates Pass, and I might go back there for sunset. Any other breathtaking views?

\-Activities: I'd like to do an art museum or 2. I love cafes/ coffee shops/ bakeries. I'd like to do some 'touristy' things. Perhaps an art market or 2, but not really into food halls, etc. What is a cool thing you didn't expect to enjoy so much? I'd perhaps like an herbal class. Also seeking an affordable massage/ holistic healing treatment. Always into good yoga (not hot yoga/ corepower) if you know of any. local culture - would love to see live music, dance, and/ or watch a show!

\-Where to stay: looking for a glamping site for a night or 2 if anyone can recommend one. I found one in a town an hour away, and that's too far. Ideally within 30 minutes of town for me, thanks!

1r0m538,https://i.redd.it/qn6mapjidkig1.jpeg,First Time ko bilang barista,"Naalala ko nung nagwo-work pa ako sa coffee shop (first work ko po yun). May dumating na customer bandang tanghali, mga tatlo sila. Nag-order sila ng 3 drinks at 1 food. Tapos nung mag-aala-una na ng hapon, may dumating pa silang ibang kasamahan hanggang sa naging 16 pax na silang lahat. Nasakop nila yung table sa tapat ng store namin.

Narinig ko pa yung iba na tinatawag yung isang lalaki na “gov,” sinasabi na manlilibre raw si gov. Minumukhaan ko yung lalaki pero hindi ko matukoy kung sino siya—parang nakita ko na yung mukha niya dati. Hanggang sa inabot na sila ng gabi, andun pa rin sila. Naiinis na yung TL ko kasi 16 pax sila pero tatlo lang yung inorder, tapos inabot pa ng gabi. Imbis na makaupo yung ibang customers, wala na silang maupuan kasi nasakop nila yung table sa tapat.

Nung magbi-bill out na, pumunta yung “gov” na sinasabi nila sa CR at sinabi niyang separate daw yung bill. Inayos na ng TL ko yung billing, pero ang tagal niya sa CR, kaya sinabi ng TL ko na dalhin ko na yung bill sa table. Nung dinala ko na yung bill, sabi ko lang, “Iwan ko lang po yung bill,” tapos nagulat yung mga kasamahan niya. Bakit daw naka-separate—akala kasi nila si gov daw ang magbabayad. Syempre, hindi ko naman alam yun, kaya umalis na ako pagkatapos kong ilapag yung bill.

Nung lumabas na siya ng CR, hinanap niya yung bill at tinanong kung nasaan na. Sabi ng TL ko, andun na raw sa table. Bigla siyang nagalit at sinabi na bakit ko raw nilagay dun, baka akalain daw ng mga kasamahan niya na nagpapalibre siya. Kung anu-ano na yung sinabi niya sa akin—masakit—hanggang sa sinabi pa na ipapatanggal daw niya ako sa store. Syempre, nagulat ako at nag-loading yung utak ko, kaya humingi na lang ako ng pasensya at sinabi ko na hindi ko po alam at sinunod ko lang yung utos ng TL namin.

Hanggang sa kinausap na rin siya ng TL at humingi rin ng pasensya. Ayun, umalis siyang bad trip. Ilang araw ang lumipas, bwisit pa rin ako sa kanya kasi ginagawa ko lang naman yung trabaho ko pero kung anu-ano na yung sinabi niya. Iniisip ko kung saan ko ba talaga siya nakita, tapos may naalala akong tao, kaya sinearch ko sa Google yung pangalan. Then boom—tama nga hinala ko, si J\\\*nv!c nga.

Nung sinabi ko sa kasamahan ko na si J\\\*nv!c yun, sabi niya hindi raw malayo yung mukha. Nung tinignan ko sa Google, sure na sure ako na siya yun—ikaw ba naman ipahiya sa harap ng maraming tao. Kaya simula nun, bad trip na ako sa kanya pag nakikita ko siya.

Samantalang dati, tuwang-tuwa pa kami sa kanya nung nag-aaral pa ako kasi mas mabilis pa kay sa kapatid nya mag-suspend ng klase. Pero nung na-encounter ko siya, ganito pala ugali niya. So ayun lang, SKL. Hahaha.

PS: Medyo bonak ako sa part na hindi ko agad nakilala yung mukha nya hahaa sorry naman 😭",6,1770684329.0,FirstTimeKo,1,1.0,False

2. Cafe. Starbucks? Nah… HEARTBUCKS. Cause who doesn’t enjoy a nice coffee or hot chocolate and a tasty pastry with friends in a cozy shop? 

3. New hobbies. Jewelry making or wood working.

We went in November and split our time between Poipu/Koloa and Hanalei/Princeville it felt like summer the whole time despite a couple days with strong winds. Sharing our itinerary and some tips in any case it can be helpful to others. Feel free to ask questions.

**Day 1 – Arrival / Poipu**  
Settled in and relaxed. Stayed at the Sheraton Kauai Resort in an oceanfront room (4th floor, vaulted ceilings, daily housekeeping, beachfront). It's confusing finding your room on your own after check in so we recommend to get assistance including having them bring a cart for your bags and groceries. It was comfortable and bug-free so we would stay again.

**Day 2 – Poipu Beach + Brennecke Beach**  
Swam, snorkeled, lounged at Poipu Beach and admired the turtles. Set up chairs on the cliff west of Brennecke Beach for turtle viewing and sunset. Must-trys nearby: Kauai Juice Co (Hot Shot!), Musubi Truck, Koloa Fruit Stand smoothies, Brennecke’s Beach Broiler for seafood pupu platter and kalbi ribs (sat at the bar to not have to wait to get seated).

**Day 3 – Waimea Canyon + Kalalau Lookout + Salt Pond Beach**  
Drove up Waimea Canyon, stopping at nearly every lookout, ending at Kalalau Lookout. Afternoon at Salt Pond Beach for swimming, snorkeling, and a stunning sunset.

**Day 4 – Napali Coast + Luau**  
Napali Raft Expedition with Capt. Andy’s - not the most comfortable ride (sit on the sides, hold tight), but views and experience are amazing. Tip: I followed the tip from others to book early and get on the waitlist in case of cancellation. This supposed to be on Day 2 for us and ended up getting moved due to strong winds. Evening at Smith’s Luau - arrive early for garden access, kalua pork is excellent, dinner entertainment is fun, but the luau show in their covered outdoor theater is not the best I've seen. 

**Day 5 – Hanalei Bay**  
Moved to Hanalei Bay Resort (great views, comfortable, full-service, excellent staff). Relaxed, swam, and explored the town. Nearby must-trys: Hanalei Bread Company (macadamia banana bread), The Terrace for small bites and drinks (we went there twice!).

**Day 6 – Haena State Park / Kalalau Trail**  
Hiked Kalalau Trail to Hanakapi’ai Beach, then swam at Kee Beach. We also had food at Tahiti Nui and their pizza is surprisingly good!

**Day 7 – Hanalei + Kapaa + Lihue**  
Last stroll in Hanalei, breakfast/coffee in town, lunch in Kapaa, drinks and pupus in Lihue before the flight home. Got lucky that we got to try Kauai Beer while they were still open and got some merch too. 

**Food that underdelivered**  
Porky’s, Lava Lava Beach Club, Bar Acuda.

**Extra Tips**  
Princeville: walk the path near Makai Golf Course for rainbow eucalyptus trees.  
Book outdoor/boat activities early in the trip to allow rescheduling if canceled.",5,1770683866.0,VisitingHawaii,0,0.86,False
1r0lxvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1r0lxvo/19f_yearned_for_my_girlbsf_for_1_year_xxed_on/,"(19f) yearned for my girlbsf for 1 year, xxed on newyears and haven’t spoken since","**I’m staying over to visit her friend next week, (aka her apartment building) and I just need to get this off my chest and get some advice/similar experiences before I see her again.**

Me and my bestfriend Sam (M19) moved in together in a tiny apartment building for our senior year of hs. One staircase separating us lived Alex (f18) that was on the grade below us. We 3 hit it off instantly and became an inseparable trio.

Our routine for that entire year:

\- wake up & eat breakfast in our apartment

\-go to school together

\- go back home in recess to smoke cigs,  drink coffee, read and listen to vinyls

\- finish the schoolday, make dinner together

\-drive to the woods and smoke weed

\- have deep conversations

\-bake something eat a bunch of shit and watch movies til we fell asleep at \~4am

\- repeat

I don’t think I’ve ever had that deep of a friendship, I’m amazed we made everything work so well as a trio, it just kinda did.

But I was deeply in love with Alex, so much so i thought I had some sick and twisted infatuation/limerence about her. I was genuinely tweaking at night about it. And i didnt tell a soul. She was so weird, talked like a farmer and dressed like a boy from the 2000s, loved action movies &  Rue Pauls drag race, even rode a motorcycle. I loved everything about her style, face, hair and demeanour. Sometimes I couldn’t focus on what she was saying to me and had to go to my room to breathe. I pushed my feelings so sooo far down. ( I don’t think I really understood I was queer)

We 3 lived so closely together it made me feel like a prevented creep. I’d dream about kissing her and she’d wake me up to get me ready for school.

We were strictly friends, she’d even be painfully rude and sarcastic towards me. But she was never mean, she was the most selfless person I knew. But when we would get high we would end up cuddling for hours, I’d scratch her back and massage her whenever I could. We’d share her twin sized bed and she’d lay in my arms. I don’t think she ever led me on, there was just a different energy between us when we were alone together. I could name countless romantic moments I had with her that was just never mentioned or discussed ever. She bought me roses, wrote me poems etc, baked me things etc. Especially when we were drunk, I always planned to kiss her at a party but it never worked out.

And then me and Sam graduated and moved out, and other friends we had in the grade below us moved in, and I had to force myself to get over it. We both moved out 10 hours away in different directions. We all cried a lot and gave each other handmade goodbye gifts and planned roadtrips and calls to stay in contact.

But that didn’t happen, Alex completely cut contact. She never called or texted, and we were so worried sick about her because we were practically her only friends at that time. We spoke to her other friends about it and turns out she was completely fine just “busy”

Then, 6 months later

I host my annual new years party

I invite 7 of my friends form hs including her. AWKWARD silence between me/sam/her.

Because we actively tried to reach out it kust got weird at one point. We have a serious conversation outside and she basically tells us she doesn’t want to keep contact because we need to grow in different directions on our own. (Fair but, I at least expect us to be able to talk when we’re together?) So I just end up not  paying attention to her at all during the party and distract myself with hosting.

Amazing party, played games and drank of couse. Everyone in town was outside with the fireworks including us.

Alex and I end up sharing an entire bottle of vodka, and me tells me about this DISGUSTING GIRL named Emily. (Horrible person for multiple reasons) And how she’d definitely “do her” if she was drunk with her.

And i get so angry

I get so incredibly angry that I drunkenly yelled out my entire confession and all the feelings I had for her. She got so shocked she dropped my vodka bottle and shattered it on the street.

And she of course tells me she liked me back, but told herself I was off limits because of our friendship. We ended up running away from the entire party and talking for hours. About our lives and everything that had been going on for the last 6 months. And then we made out, for about 3 hours. In the snow and up against fences and behind buss stops. And when we got home at 5:30am we pretended like nothing had happened to our friends that were awake. Then we made out and ykyk in my bed alone, after all that we were sobering up and honestly it was getting too serious, so we smoked but that just made us pass out out of exhaustion and going to bed at around 06:30 am

Next morning was horrible, both so embarrassed it was horrific. I couldn’t look her in the eyes while all of us ate breakfast and I was of course asked what we did all night. We later talked and agreed that it was very stupid and unnecessary, that we had “dug up something we didn’t have to” and I agreed with that, at the time. Then she shook my hand and said “no homo”.

But now I’m a mess and I have been in a mess ever since it happened, I’ve been going through a complete identity crisis and I think about her so so much. She hasn’t even sent a text.

I just feel so emotionally unavailable because of it and I’m almost unable to move on and enjoy my new school and friends.

And like I said im visiting her friend that moved into my old apartment, and I will probably see her. I just want advice on how to keep my self respect/ boundaries/ or idk actually talk to her about it??

1r0lwwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r0lwwp/mf_last_train_to_loserville/,[MF] Last Train to Loserville,"Under a bright blue sky, in a lush valley, alongside a babbling stream. An elderly man in his seventies walks into view and steps on a stump, leaning his upper body to rest on his knee. Despite his age he seems fit, he has a square jaw and he’s handsome. In an odd trick of the light, his blue eyes seem matte, and staring silent at us for a swift moment, he begins to speak:

My name is Marty Bridgstock, I’m your Democratic nominee for senator of Pennsylvania. I wasn’t always here though, at the top of my game. Thirty years ago, the only preeminent thought running through my head was whether I was going to eat a shotgun shell in the morning or the evening. I had a hard life, nothing turned out the way I thought it would. When I was younger I went to college, it was the natural thing to do at the time. Everybody around you as a young man tells you its what you *need* to do. Get and education, get a good job, find someone to marry and pump em’ full of kids. It turns out that just because you walk the path well traveled, the fruits of life don’t shake themselves from the trees. After I left university I had dreams of becoming a great philosopher or intellectual, but to be frank after going to school for my entire life I was ready to do something simple and let the days pass me by. That’s how I started building houses for Grendel Land Company. A noble trade, but I wasn’t the man to take it where it could take me. I got caught up in the racket of subsisting solely to subsist. I lived that way for probably twenty years, taking no interest in anything, leaving no mark anywhere, all the while my hair turned grey and my insides were turning against me. I was at my lowest and ready to end it all, but that’s when the call came, that’s when I turned my life around for the better, that’s what I want to share with you.

The call, as I call it, came in at roughly 4 o’clock in the morning. Thankfully, I was already awake after many years of working the sort of jobs that paid well at the expense of my mental acuity, patience, and bodily fortitude. Luckily, I wasn’t busy either, I didn’t need to wash myself because when you work in the trades everyone already expects you to look like shit. As long as were are prompt and got the work done well the packaging you arrived in was of little relevance. I didn’t need to prepare breakfast because one of the monolithic beauties of this country is the twenty four hour gas station, where the coffee is always hot and so are the dubious egg sandwiches that your body becomes accustomed to. Those were the precise faustian morsels I was meditating on after tying one boot and holding the other on my lap, staring holes into the carpet in the near dark of my living room when the call came. Although, I wouldn’t recognize it for what it was until later that day.

The sensation inside of my body, at the time, was equal parts vague and implacable. It began as a minuscule whine from the depths of my ears. But unlike the tinnitus that I was surely developing, this whine carried with it a breadth of deep undertones. It was like the squeak of a wooden axle that carried the great stone grinding wheels of the windmills of old. It was like the bones of an old building creaking out their most secretive desire to give up and collapse into rubble. It was like the massive bodily turning of the Earth, creating the smallest whistling disturbance in the air. This was the amniotic feeling that I persisted to ignore by putting on my other boot and heading out into the pre-dawn world.

During my drive to work the ringing in my ears shifted to a dull toothache. I had been putting off going to the dentist for years, mostly for lack of insurance, but when the company did finally shell out for dental I was by no means in any habit of oral care. At this time the call began to manifest externally, in brazen and taunting harmony with my internal discomfort. Driving felt as though the bottom had given out on my car. I wasn’t traveling in a solid motor vehicle but rather some gelatinous mass that was swaying and bouncing its way along down the road. What was stranger was that the highway was entirely devoid of other drivers. Rather, the emergency lanes were packed with vehicles parked with their tail lights invariably pointed back towards me. As I passed by them they would reflect a synchronized series of red lights funneling me towards my workplace.

When I first noticed this I stopped dead on the highway waiting for any sign of emergency vehicles or any of the car’s owners. I must have idled for five minutes or so before continuing on my way. The sidelined vehicles with their red fairy lights seemed to go on forever, and combined with the un-solid nature of my own car the lights began undulating which made me incredibly nauseous. I pulled over and threw up into an old fast food bag that had become a permanent resident of my passenger seat. I wiped the sick from my lips and let the cold sweat scurry from my brow. I can’t recall what bullshit excuse I made to self soothe and continue on my way. Something to the tune of

“well, I still have to get paid” or some other platitude working people tell themselves to persist in their drudgery. I was only a few minutes away from the shop at this point so I continued on feeling slightly better. Whether the marginal relief I had felt was a matter of my stomach normalizing after puking or some aspect of the ancient lizard brain realizing that there was no turning me around I would never come to find out.

The parking lot was more full than usual. I figured there must have been a meeting or something, but early as I was, I waited a while in my car despite the new rank odor it carried. I smoked a cigarette to try to cover up the smell of vomit in my car and on myself and then sauntered into work trying my best to keep the strangeness of the day down.

“If I still feel like shit at noon, I’ll go home, but I still need to make *some* money today”

Walking through the open garage door and feeling the winter chill on the back of my neck I saw all of my coworkers standing shoulder to shoulder frozen in a circle. Emitting from their eyes, noses, and mouths was a sickly green light that washed colder the concrete walls and floor of the supply garage. The sight was so startling I dropped the wet bag of vomit meant for the trashcan and it ruptured, seeping out and forming a puddle of bile around my boots.

Before I could approach the standing stones who were my former coworkers I heard footsteps descending the steel staircase. Each step resounded and echoed on top of the last and amplified the sound in my head. Beneath the discordant amplification the ringing returned to my ears in addition to my impenetrable toothache and upset stomach. This was the call, and it was coming from the feet of a man slight in stature and portly, looking ever more minuscule compared to the columns in the great warehouse. It was the owner of the company, and my mentor, Tom.

“Jesus, Marty, you look like shit.”

“The other guys, they’re all-”

“They’re all fine, why don’t you follow me to my office?”

He turned and made his back up the stairs reinforcing harrowing gonging in my head. As he walked it was as if he was leaving a path behind him wherein the auditory attack I was under wasn’t as all encompassing; leaving my only option to follow or else my head might be split in two from sheer discomfort. He spoke as he cleaved his way through the reverberations ahead of me.

“You’ve been doing really well Marty, you really have. It’s been a long time that you’ve been here but I can tell you’re not really giving your all, and we can’t display our appreciation enough.”

I stammered a pitiful response but before I could finish he was interrupting me again.

“There’s only a few issues with you. The first and perhaps the most glaring is that you stink. I mean you really smell god awful. Like a corpse, Marty, that’s exactly what you smell like, a rotting corpse.”

I hesitantly caught a whiff of myself, he was right, the smell of death was ripe on my body.

“And the second thing Marty, you’re pompous.”

“Excuse me?”

“You’re pompous. It’s obvious that you think you’re better than the rest of the guys.”

“Well I’m definitely a better carpenter.”

He chuckled to himself at my response.

“That may be the case, but that’s not what I’m talking about. Why don’t you have a seat?”

We had turned the corner in the hallway towards his office. It was cleaner than normal, more sanitary. The walls had a fresh sheen as though they had been freshly painted. There were none of the yellowed smoke stains lingering across the drop ceiling, nor any of the crumpled up receipts or sticky notes that I was accustomed to. It was as though the building was entirely new, nascent. I sat down reluctantly, feeling like I was going to vomit again I grasped at my stomach like it was a baby. I weakly raised my gaze to meet his. He didn’t have any whites to his eyes. In the clears of his eyes there was a matte finish, but looking deeper, there was motion.

“The fact of the matter Marty, is that you are different from the other guys. You’re worse. You think because you went to school and the other guys didn’t, because you see the world reflected in books you read twenty years ago, because you can silently wax philosophically to yourself about the value of material work, that you’re better than everyone else. Now is this a crime? No. Does it make you extremely irritating to talk to and work with? Yes. But the more important element is this: the other guys, they all have stuff to live for. Wives, husbands, children, hobbies. And what do you have, Marty?”

I remained silent.

“That’s exactly right, you don’t have shit. All you have is this job, and the gall to set yourself on a pedestal above your fellow workers. You even have the nerve to think yourself wise enough to prescribe to them how they should live and conduct themselves, but in reality, in the real world, you don’t know anything about what it’s like to be them or the struggles that they put themselves through, and yet you *still* think you’re better than them. But the good news is, that makes you a perfect candidate for promotion”

“Promotion?”

As I uttered the words, he raised his arms up and grabbed himself under the chin and twisted his head around until his neck snapped. His head kept turning, revealing the machine threads that adhered his head onto his neck. He turned his head higher until with a last sickening crack his head popped off and he set it aside on his desk. In the spaces where his eyes once were there were two itty-bitty little green men standing on a platform behind two control panels laden with buttons and levers.

“WHAT THE FUCK ARE THOSE THINGS?!”

When they spoke, they spoke through Tom’s mouth and with his voice.

“We’re you’re new advisors, Marty. We’re going to optimize you for your new leadership position.”

They had no facial features, and were moving their arms so fast across their control panels it looks like the beating of a hummingbird’s heart. Trying to follow their movements I lost control of my stomach and threw up again. Seeing the contents of my stomach spew out from my mouth Tom’s voice chuckled and said,

“We’re going to hollow you out, Marty. Well, you’ve done most of the hollowing for us. I guess the more accurate thing to say is we’re going to fill you up.”

Tom’s body, or the little men’s body then stood up leaving their head on the desk and walked gracefully towards me in my chair. The vomit hadn’t stopped and it was spraying out of my fingers in a guttural fan wetting the fresh carpet. They grabbed me by the shoulders, careful not to get wetted by my innards and rolled me down the hall on the office chair towards the finance office. They slammed me into the door, busting it open. Inside, there was the corpse of a huge horse laying bloated on the floor. The walls were lined with cash registers and odd little funnels that rocketed nickels and dimes at terminal velocity into every open orifice of the horse. Looking into the mouth of the horse I could see more of them, the little green men. The horse was their nursery, their own little earth, and they were living entire lives inside of it: partying and hanging, dancing, laughing, killing one another, fucking, there were millions of them. My body was paralyzed there was nothing I could do as Tom started twisting my head on my neck around and around until there was another sickening pop and suddenly everything was dark, but I could feel them, thousands of them and their feverish revelry as they poured into me.

And funny enough, I didn’t care as they rent my head from my shoulders. I felt better than I had before, as they ripped my mucus membrane wallpaper from the inside of my head and remodeled my skull. I felt good about myself for the first time in a long time. I was better than everyone else, and I was better because of them, you see? I didn’t need any of the stuff the other guys needed. I didn’t need a family or a community or hobbies, because I had these little guys in me pulling my levers. Pushing me to the top! They taught me how to use my apathy and my disgust, how by feigning vulnerability with my once fellow man I could hoodwink thousands of people into believing that I had their best interests at heart. They taught me how to use the avarice of the world to turn people against their neighbors to appease their enemies. They taught me how to pivot They made me manager, and then mayor, then governor, and now they’re going to make me senator and then probably president. Who knows? Lord God King Marty Bridgstock has a nice ring to it. It wasn’t always easy, and lord knows it wasn’t free, stripping away all of my humanity to pull on over on my constituents. But when it’s feeling difficult telling my fellow man to eat shit in my thousand dollar shoes on my office, I remember that fated morning. When I left for work that day, I didn’t have a god damned thing. But now I have all these fucked up little guys inside of me, and they’re my buddies, and they made me rich.",2,1770683732.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I got a call from my doctor saying that I was positive for hydrogen SIBO, but didn't actually see the results right away.

I realized I could get my results straight from Triosmart and they're a bit confusing. It says that my baseline for hydrogen was 31 ppm, which seems high. My increase was 45.6 ppm at 75 min and 59.6 at 90 min which flagged as abnormal given that it seemed to cross the 20 ppm threshold sometime between 75 and 90 minutes. The tests says positive for hydrogen SIBO.

Does this seem right? I'm concerned about the high baseline mostly, as all I can find online is that it should have been less than 16ppm, but I followed the diet closely. Water and coffee for drinks (maybe tea? It was a while ago that I tested, but triosmart says that's allowed) and eggs, chicken, rice, potatoes, oil, salt, and pepper. All things allowed by Triosmart.

I've already met with a dietitian who wants me to follow a low fodmap diet for 6 weeks before taking the antibiotics. I'm 3 weeks in to the diet and it's definitely helping, but just noticed the weird results today. What do you guys think of the results? Do they seem accurate? Invalid?

I try to go by, ""it's the thought that counts."" But as I get older and have limited room in my home for new things, one of my biggest growing pet peeves is when the thought doesn't actually seem to be there. This comes in a few flavors:

1. They buy gifts based on what *they* like, or what's *their* style, not what the recipients like. For example, I have a ""Disney adult"" relative who frequently buys people Disney themed gifts regardless of whether or not they actually like Disney. 

2. Assuming someone will like something because it's popular/pop culture. Like the time I was given a Star Wars-related gift when I've never shown an ounce of interest in Star Wars. This also goes for those people who buy you things with random characters/pop culture references on them.

3. They give gift cards to places the recipient has never mentioned liking, like giving a Starbucks card to someone who doesn't drink coffee or go to Starbucks.

4. They buy someone something random because they think it looks cool without really knowing what it is. My go-to example: one year for my birthday in my mid-20s, someone bought me a Steven Universe plush. I have not watched Steven Universe. I don't like it. They also had no idea what Steven Universe even *was*. They just thought the plush ""looked cool"". Like surely if you don't know what something is, and it isn't something someone's specifically asked for, you would look into it before buying it?

5. They buy you things you specifically say you don't want, but they insist they think you should have.

1r0ltl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1r0ltl3/which_surface_or_android_device_should_i_replace/,Which Surface or Android device should I replace my iPad Air with?,"I purchased my first iPad a couple of years ago.  It’s been going well but I soon realized 64gb is not a lot on an iPad.  I like to use my device to view and edit photos that I’ve taken (on a DSLR camera) and play random games like Roblox or Minecraft. Coming over from the android/windows world, I have enjoyed learning and using the iPad.  There are a lot of small things I like about using my device.

I started looking at upgraded iPads recently, and then this recent iOS update happened.  How sad is it that I now prefer my Surface Pro 2 (yes a 12+ year old device) to view/edit my photos because the UI is simple and works consistently?  Plus I have plenty of storage (only 128gb but still plenty left).  Whoever said “hey, when someone opens a photo from an sd card, we know they want Apple Intelligence and playground to be the default” while also designing this preview app that is similarly infuriating to use, I hope their coffee gets cold prematurely and their next meal is overcooked.

Lately everything on my iPad has become so frustrating, I don’t enjoy using it at all.  How badly do they F up the interface that I can’t simply scroll photos from an sd card?  Oh there’s a new update, time to offload half of the apps I use because half of my storage is used up by iOS/system data.  It’s just dumb.  Yes part of the issue is storage space, but I refuse to pay monthly fees for that.  I realize my next device needs at least 256gb and likely 512gb to be safe.

1r0lt07,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1r0lt07/the_psychology_of_being_irreplaceable_why/,The Psychology of Being IRREPLACEABLE: Why Emotional Intelligence Beats Everything Else,"So I have been noticing something weird lately. Everyone's freaking out about AI taking jobs, meanwhile, there's this one skill that keeps popping up in every ""future of work"" discussion. The more I dug into research from MIT, Cal Newport's books, industry reports, and conversations with people making serious money, the clearer it became: emotional intelligence isn't just some HR buzzword anymore. It's literally the skill separating people who get replaced from those who become indispensable.

Here's what nobody tells you, though. We're taught that being smart = success. Get good grades, learn technical skills, and work hard. But then you graduate and realize your coworker who barely passed is getting promoted over you because they somehow just get people. It's frustrating as hell because nobody actually teaches this stuff in school.

The thing is, EQ isn't about being fake nice or manipulative. It's about understanding human behavior well enough to navigate literally any situation. And the best part? Unlike IQ, this is completely trainable.

**\*\*1. Master the art of reading rooms\*\***

Most people walk into situations completely blind to social dynamics. They miss tension, ignore nonverbal cues, and wonder why their ""great idea"" bombed in the meeting. Meanwhile, people with high EQ are scanning constantly. Who's engaged? Who's checked out? Where's the resistance coming from?

Start practicing this everywhere. Coffee shop, family dinners, Zoom calls. Notice body language, tone shifts, and energy changes. When someone says ""I'm fine"" but their shoulders are tensed up, and they won't make eye contact, that's data. Your brain is already picking this stuff up subconsciously; you just need to tune into it consciously.

Daniel Goleman's book \*[Emotional Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Intelligence-Matter-More-Than/dp/055338371X)\* is the OG here. Published in 1995, it literally created this field, and it's still the best foundation. Goleman's a psychologist who spent decades researching what makes people successful, and his conclusion basically destroyed the ""IQ is everything"" myth. The book breaks down the five components of EQ in a way that's actually practical. I went in skeptical and came out realizing how much I'd been handicapping myself by ignoring this entire dimension of intelligence. This is the best starting point if you want to actually understand how emotions work and why they matter more than most technical skills.

**\*\*2. Learn to manage your emotional triggers\*\***

Here's something I learned from therapy and wish someone had told me earlier. When you get defensive, angry, or anxious, that's your nervous system hijacking your prefrontal cortex. You literally cannot think clearly in that state. People with high EQ recognize this happening and have strategies to reset before responding.

The best technique I've found is the physiological sigh. Inhale deeply through your nose, take a second shorter inhale to fully expand your lungs, then exhale slowly through your mouth. Dr. Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast, the neuroscience checks out. It's the fastest way to calm your nervous system down.

Also, start tracking your triggers. When do you get defensive? What situations make you anxious? What patterns keep repeating? Just noticing them gives you a split second to choose your response instead of reacting automatically.

**\*\*3. Practice strategic empathy\*\***

This isn't about being a therapist to everyone. It's about understanding what people actually want vs what they're saying. Your boss says the presentation needs to be ""more impactful."" What they really mean could be a dozen different things depending on context. Strategic empathy means asking clarifying questions, picking up subtext, and addressing the actual concern.

Chris Voss wrote \*[Never Split the Difference](https://www.amazon.com.be/-/en/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/0062407805)\*, and it's genuinely insane how useful this book is. He was the FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator for years. The book is packed with techniques he used in literal life-or-death situations, but they work just as well in salary negotiations or difficult conversations. The tactical empathy framework alone is worth the read. Fair warning, though, once you learn these techniques, you'll notice when others are trying to use them on you, which is kinda funny. Insanely good read if you want to level up your negotiation and communication game.

**\*\*4. Build genuine influence through listening\*\***

Most people listen just long enough to figure out what they want to say next. Real listening means you're trying to actually understand their perspective, not just waiting for your turn to talk. When you do this consistently, people start trusting you more because they feel genuinely heard, which is rare as hell nowadays.

Try this: in your next conversation, focus entirely on understanding rather than responding. Ask follow-up questions. Paraphrase what they said to confirm you got it right. Notice how the dynamic shifts. People will literally tell you, ""wow I've never thought about it that way,"" when all you did was reflect their own thoughts clearly.

**\*\*5. Develop conflict resolution skills\*\***

Every high earner I know is comfortable with conflict. Not aggressive, just comfortable. They can have difficult conversations without it becoming personal. They disagree without being disagreeable. This is probably the highest ROI skill you can develop.

The framework is simple but takes practice. Focus on the problem, not the person. Use ""I"" statements instead of ""you"" accusations. Stay curious about their perspective even when you disagree. Find the underlying interest beneath stated positions. Most workplace conflicts are just misaligned expectations that nobody bothered to clarify.

If you're serious about developing these skills but find reading multiple books overwhelming, there's[ BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450), an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and Google experts. You can set a specific goal like ""become better at managing conflict as someone who avoids confrontation,"" and it generates a personalized learning plan pulling from psychology research, books like the ones mentioned here, and expert interviews in emotional intelligence and communication.

What makes it useful is the depth control; you can start with a 10-minute summary of key conflict resolution strategies, and if something clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and nuanced context. The voice customization is surprisingly addictive too; there's everything from a calm, measured tone to a more energetic style depending on your mood. It's designed to fit learning into commutes or workouts rather than requiring dedicated study time.

**\*\*6. Actually use your emotional data\*\***

Your emotions are giving you constant feedback about what matters to you, what's working, and what's not. Most people just try to suppress or ignore them. People with high EQ treat emotions like a dashboard; they provide useful information about what needs attention.

Feeling resentful about something? That's your brain saying a boundary got crossed. Feeling anxious? Could be your intuition picking up on something off. Feeling energized? You're probably aligned with your values. Start asking ""what is this emotion trying to tell me?"" instead of just pushing it away.

The app Finch is surprisingly helpful for building this habit. It's a self-care pet app that sounds dumb but actually works. You check in with your emotions daily, set small goals, and your little bird grows with you. The act of naming your emotional state regularly builds that awareness muscle. Plus, it's weirdly motivating to not disappoint your digital pet.

**\*\*7. Build your self-awareness foundation\*\***

This is the hardest one because it requires actually facing your blind spots. We all have patterns we're not aware of. Maybe you interrupt people constantly. Maybe you avoid conflict until things explode. Maybe you take everything personally. You cannot fix what you cannot see.

\*Insight\* by Tasha Eurich is the most research-backed book on self-awareness I've found. She's an organizational psychologist who studied thousands of people and found that 95% of us think we're self-aware, but only 10-15% actually are. The book breaks down internal self-awareness (understanding yourself) vs external self-awareness (understanding how others see you), and gives specific exercises to improve both. The research on ""why"" questions vs ""what"" questions alone changed how I process situations. This is the best self-awareness book I've ever read, cuts through all the fluffy nonsense.

**\*\*8. Practice emotional agility\*\***

Life's gonna throw curveballs constantly. Projects fail, relationships end, plans fall apart. Emotional agility is about adapting to these changes without completely falling apart or rigidly clinging to what's not working anymore.

Susan David's TED talk on this is excellent, and her book \*Emotional Agility\* expands on it. The core idea is learning to be flexible with your thoughts and feelings rather than being hooked by them. You can feel disappointed about something while still moving forward productively. You can notice anxiety without letting it dictate your decisions.

Look, I'm not gonna lie and say mastering EQ is easy or quick. It takes consistent practice, and you'll mess up constantly at first. But here's the thing: in a world where technical skills become obsolete faster than ever, and AI can do more each year, the ability to understand and work with humans becomes exponentially more valuable. Companies don't fire people who make everyone around them better. They don't automate away the person who can navigate any situation and make stakeholders feel heard.

Plus, honestly, developing EQ just makes life better. Your relationships improve, conflicts feel less scary, and you understand yourself more clearly. The career benefits are huge, but the life benefits are even bigger.

Start small. Pick one thing from this list and practice it for a week. Notice what happens. Build from there. The people making serious money aren't necessarily the smartest in the room anymore; they're the ones who can read the room, manage relationships, and navigate complexity without burning bridges.",1,1770683451.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

You can see the ice over half of this pond, but I was in jeans and a T shirt!

Water takes a long time to react to a change in temperature. Thank goodness! It would stink if your coffee got cold as soon as you poured it, or your bath water got cold as soon as you turned on the air conditioning. Same thing if your ice cold Coke got hot as soon as you pulled it out of the refrigerator. 

Try considering the weather conditions for the past week when trying to determine what the water will be like, so you can plan your baits or lures accordingly. 

Sudden changes in air pressure have a much more meaningful effect on fish than sudden changes in temperature will. I always have great luck right before and at the very beginning of a thunderstorm.

I don't know your name, where you live, what you do for a living, or even if you have any social media presence whatsoever. I know that I'm speaking to an individual, but I'm not speaking directly to you yet, since you're still unknown to me at this point; and (2) the intent of this letter is for me to affirm to the universe my growth track as I grow and heal to become the right woman, rather than trying to flag down the right man. These words are like an exam, if you will, showing the universe in real-time that I'm learning the right lessons and healing the way that I should. 

Now, on with the countdown!

My stage of healing right now is that, upon learning more about how my former toxic habits were formed in childhood, somehow chasing after distant and avoidant men became considered an accomplishment to me. (yes, I know, very sickening and disturbing!) I won't go into the sordid details in this space, but it's enough to touch on to understand that I had once seen being able to ""win"" a distant and avoidant man was an accomplishment. My parents yelled at me, screamed with anger at me when I was aiming to study for my ACT/SATs, or signing up for extracurricular activities along with my peers, or researching which type of colleges that I wanted to visit one day. But running after the wrong men? Yes, the only time that I remember them not yelling at me, screaming at me, and telling me that I'm not worth anything. In a very disturbing way, I even considered that an accomplishment!

As I continue my healing and leveling up, I'm beginning to redefine my sense of accomplishment. The first rule: THE ACQUISITION OF A MAN IS NOT AN ACCOMPLISHMENT. It's not an accomplishment getting a man's attention, showing off that I'm better than another woman that he may be entertaining, and going out of my way to make him want me. 

This is where you come in, my right guy. My not seeing you as an accomplishment is the first step in making sure that, in the event you appear magically out of thin air and into my daily world, I'll be able to see you the right way. You are an *added bonus* in my life, the addition to my life that makes everything much *sweeter*. My life is a cup of coffee, rich and bold; you're the coffee creamer to enhance my coffee-drinking experience. My life is a plate of spaghetti, garlic bread, side salad and the chilled white Zinfandel; you're the Parmesan cheese that's sprinkled on top of the sauce and meatballs. You're the A1 steak sauce to the NY Strip that I'm feasting on. Get it? 

This is one of the reasons why I'm not chasing after you or going out of my way to flag you down. Among those reasons, one of them is that my chasing you means that I'm not taking advantage of the many opportunities in my life that are readily available for me to enjoy, learn, and grow. (besides, if I'm able to chase you, you wouldn't be my right guy; I was only chasing after all the wrong ones) When I'm tempted to look for you, the right question to ask myself is, ""*Am I making the most of where I am in my life, right now?*"" I'm learning that when I take the time to honestly reflect on this question and evaluate my behavior, I see a correlation between the temptation to chase you while not pouring myself into my life and really making sure I'm living the best life I possibly can while being the best version of myself. 

Now, don't get me wrong! I look forward to one day when you join me alongside and we're doing life together. I anticipate when I'll be able to welcome your friendship, ask you questions as I get to know you more, and involve you in my world. I want you to understand that I'm not looking to you or expecting you to make up for what is lacking in my own life. It is my responsibility to make sure that my own life is full, equitable, enriching, and moving forward in the right direction. When the time is right, you'll magically appear and you'll be there. 

That is all.

My roommate has been going ape shit because I set this reptile that she keeps as a pet free. For context, my roommate (22f) and I(24m) live in a 2 bedroom community style apartment block in Brazil, and it's very common to see these animals out on the veranda running around, i think it is called a gecko

So a couple months ago we were having a coffee and chatting outside and we see a baby gecko with bites on him and uneven legs so he walked funny. My roommate felt bad and sounded determined that she would raise him since she has abandonment issues which I will not go into. However, she is a pretty messy person. I make her clean the common areas and keep the kitchen tidy after she uses it, but her room is obviously a different story since that's her private space. 

over the weekend she went away to visit a friend and she asked me to take care of her reptile which was no problem for me but after seeing the state of her room and where she kept the gecko I immediately knew I had to set it free. To illustrate a little, the gecko was in a rather large card board box with air holes poked in, and inside of the box was what looked like the stuffing you put in a hamsters cage, a small water tray and a little hammock that was actually quite cute. I felt really bad just seeing it, and brought the box outside, opened it and let it be free. 

Galo (the gecko) does like the veranda and has been living there in the shaded rocky area, so when my roommate got back and I told her she started freaking out at me saying I let one of her family run away. I told her these geckos are not meant to live like that and I cannot stand for it. she still hasn't captured him again, because he was running on the walls and she couldn't knock him off with a broom. I feel like she is being very possessive over something that should not belong to her, but she is making me feel a crazy saying the reptile is much safer in our home, aita?

I’m sorry people are totally gonna be tired of seeing my name pop up in this thread but I’m struggling mentally so bad right now!

Yesterday I was crying about not even being able to have my coffee without a blood sugar spike even with 18 units of insulin. This was especially frustrating because throughout my GD diagnosis I’ve had my coffee without any issues so the sudden spikes were throwing me off.

Today I had 20 units of insulin but ended up not drinking my coffee. I did however have my breakfast which consisted of cauliflower, broccoli, a carrot stick, a sausage link, and a stick of string cheese with a 1/4 of low fat cottage cheese. This is something that again I have eaten throughout my pregnancy even with the GD and my blood sugar has always been 121 or 132 if I have fruit with it… So imagine the absolute defeat that I felt when my blood sugar reading was 174!!! 

I have struggled to have a healthy relationship with food my whole life. Between binging and purging, extreme calorie counting (to the point of counting calories in cough drops when sick), and even considering less than safe practices to lose weight. I’m not going to lie and say I’m thin - I have been fat most of my life except for when I was actively hurting myself with extreme calorie counting and exercising even when injured.. This round of GD is really fucking with my head because I feel so angry at food. I go back and forth between “I just won’t eat” and “Screw it I might as well eat whatever since nothing seems to matter”… I hate myself for feeling this way…

But I think I may have figured out why my sugars have been so all over the place? About 10 days ago I ran out of my Lexapro prescription- I have been on 40mg (20mg more than the max dose) since 2020… but my doctor has been unable to see me to get a refill renewal so I have been experiencing major withdrawal. Light headedness, low BP, palpitations, my moods are all over the place…I have been in absolute hell. I’m trying to get ahold of my psychiatrist for a refill but I’m about to seek out the mental crisis helpline to see if they can help at all. During thinking about my blood sugar levels and withdrawal symptoms… I wondered if my body is just in overdrive when it comes to cortisol levels at the moment because of the sudden lack of anxiety control? I have an appointment with my OB endocrinologist on Friday and of course will be discussing this with her (hopefully I’ll be back on my meds by then) but I’m just curious if anyone else has ever experienced SSRI withdrawal while dealing with GD? It has me feeling so defeated like I’m guaranteed to graduate from GD to full blown T2 diabetes after birth. 😭😭",4,1770682241.0,GestationalDiabetes,4,1.0,False

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Well, while it definitely doesn't wreck my GI tract like coffee and doesn't give me ""coffee breath"", after not having any caffeine for 9 month I can definitely feel ill effects that it gives me. Just a few hours of withdrawal and I got ravaging headache. Before that I've got it after just 1 day of not repeating caffeine. During consumption each time I feel like it wasn't even caffeine but alcohol, but alcohol is much lighter on me in comparison! With tea caffeine it feels like my head is floating, and then it follows with sharp crash – I feel no energy whatsoever. I wonder why this drug is so normalized, like... it acts like a drug, I don't feel any added energy but instead a weird drugged-like state similar to alcohol. It makes me smile that some religions that outlaw alcohol are actually some of the most caffeinated countries... Caffeine addiction is quite similar to alcoholism because both rely on cycle repetition day by day, because you no longer control the substance: it controls you instead. You will drink crappy tea or coffee or energy drink even if you don't want to, just because your body tells you to. Scary, isn't it?

With chocolate it is much easier tho. Both hot chocolate and chocolate seem to not give me any effects, probably amount of caffeine in those is very insignificant, it acts on me like any herbal infusion. I didn't try cacao drink tho, I believe this might be slightly more caffeinated

I'm pretty new to iOS development, and when I found out Apple charges $99/year just to test my own app on my own phone through TestFlight... I was a little shocked. On Android and web this is just free. So I spent an afternoon figuring out a workaround, and honestly it's been working great.

Here's the full setup.

# The Problem (And Why It Annoyed Me)

When you run `expo start` locally, it works beautifully — as long as your phone is on the same WiFi. Step outside your apartment? Disconnected. Want to test while you're out? Too bad. And the ""official"" path for remote testing — TestFlight — is locked behind Apple's $99/year Developer Program.

For someone just building a side project and wanting to test on a real phone, that felt like overkill.

# The Fix: Tunnel Mode + A Cheap VPS

Run your Expo dev server on a VPS in tunnel mode:

bash

    EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN=myapp npx expo start --tunnel

That's it. `EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN` keeps the URL the same across server restarts (so your shortcuts and bookmarks don't break). Your phone connects to the tunnel URL from anywhere — home, coffee shop, commute, different country. Hot reload still works, so you save a file and see the change on your phone immediately.

**Cost:** \~$4/month for a Hetzner CX22 (Ubuntu).

# My Actual Setup

I'm running my full stack on one small VPS:

* **API backend** (FastAPI, port 8000)
* **Expo dev server** in tunnel mode
* **tmux** to keep both running in the background
* **GitHub Actions** for auto-deployment when I push changes

If you're not familiar with tmux — it's a terminal multiplexer that keeps processes alive even after you disconnect from SSH. You can close your laptop and everything keeps running on the server.

My tmux session has 3 windows:

|Window|What Runs|
|:-|:-|
|`api`|Backend server (0.0.0.0:8000)|
|`expo`|Expo tunnel dev server|
|`monitor`|htop for system monitoring|

I SSH in, run `tmux attach`, and everything's already there. For deploys, GitHub Actions SSHs into the VPS on push to `main`, pulls latest, installs deps, restarts the service, and runs a health check. The Expo tunnel stays up through backend deploys, so there's no interruption on my phone.

# The Trick That Makes It Feel Like a Real App

This is honestly my favorite part.

1. Open iOS **Shortcuts** app
2. Create a new shortcut → add **""Open URL""** action → paste your Expo tunnel URL
3. **Add to Home Screen** with a custom icon

That's it. Now you have an app icon on your home screen that looks and feels like a real app. Tap it → Expo Go opens → your app loads. No scanning QR codes. No typing URLs. No opening Expo Go and hunting for your project.

**Why this matters for testing with friends:** You can share the tunnel URL with anyone who has Expo Go installed, and they can add the same shortcut to their phone. You don't have to explain ""okay so download Expo Go, then scan this QR code, then..."" — it's just an icon.

# What You Get

* Test on your **real device** from any network
* **Hot reload** — save a file, see it on your phone immediately
* Backend auto-deploys via CI/CD, no downtime
* Home screen shortcut that feels like a native app
* Share with friends — anyone with Expo Go can use your tunnel URL
* Works for Android too (Expo Go from the Play Store)
* **\~$4/month** vs $99/year for the Developer Program

# Honest Tradeoffs

* Tunnel adds some latency compared to local WiFi development
* This is a dev build — performance and behavior won't be identical to a production App Store build
* You **still need the $99 Developer Program eventually** if you want to submit to the App Store
* The tunnel URL is public, so don't use this for anything with sensitive data unless you add auth

For daily development and testing on a real device though? This has been a game changer for me.

# Setup Time

\~30 minutes from a fresh Ubuntu VPS. I wrote a bash script that handles:

* Node.js and Python installation
* Expo CLI setup
* Firewall configuration (UFW)
* tmux helper scripts
* Environment variable configuration

It's idempotent (safe to run multiple times). Working on turning it into a proper GitHub repo with documentation and example configs. If you'd use it, let me know in the comments and I'll prioritize getting it out.

**Genuinely curious:** what does your iOS testing workflow look like? Are you paying for the Developer Program? Using a different workaround? I'd love to hear what other people are doing.",3,1770681958.0,expo,2,1.0,False

1r0l5xc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r0l5xc,"Heart of Daggers Platform Update: Character Creator + Campaign Frames, New Encounter Stages, 2000+ Icons, Visual Mode & Artist Guild","Hey everyone 👋🏼 Matt here from Heart of Daggers

We're back with our February platform update! Alongside a bunch of Character Creator changes and a lot of polish + QoL work, we’ve just finished a major new Encounter Manager feature. We've also included a massive collection of Images + Icons for homebrew usage. Many of these changes were inspired by our awesome Discord community – thank you to our almost 900 members.

Ok... here we go...

# 1) Encounter Stages (new!)

Stages let you build multiple rooms or phases inside a single encounter. Instead of creating and bouncing between separate encounters for a location, you can now keep everything contained and move through it step by step.

* Each stage has its own adversaries and environments
* You can name stages so it’s clear what’s in each “room”
* Stages can be rearranged
* Battle points are calculated per stage, so you can quickly check balance as move

The goal here was to make longer scenes, dungeons, hexcrawls, and multi-room areas easier to run without juggling tabs or duplicating encounters. We think this one’s going to change how a lot of your sessions flow.

# 2) Our Character Creator gets so much better

Our Character Creator has passed **3,500 character creations in just over a month**, and we’ve continued refining the experience.

>***We’ve also commissioned 200+ character portraits for the Character Creator***, covering every Ancestry + Class combination – and more. Some of these are already available to select for free!

* **Character Creator UI overhaul.** Looks much more... Daggerhearty.
* **Campaign frame support** was added to Character Creator for Motherboard, Colossus of the Drylands, Beast Feast, The Age of Umbra, and The Witherwild. More on these later.
* Death Moves and Scars now trigger automatically when you mark your final HP, including scar tracking and hope loss.
* Characters can be saved as premades after creation.
* Trackers were updated to properly support per-session and per-rest usage.
* **New Visual Mode!** View class, subclass, heritage, and domain cards in a beautiful Daggerheart-style layout. You can even add custom cards... We love this mode, and can see this being used for deep roleplay moments.
* **Domain Ability cards** now include roll to hit, roll for damage, and trackers to make dealing damage and tracking expenses easier.
* **New portraits:** 20 custom commissioned character portraits are now available during creation (with 170+ more in production to cover every ancestry + class combination). We also have all 9 Class artworks being delivered soon, too.
* New inventory system lets you add weapons, armor, items, and consumables directly from the SRD.
* Weapons and armor can be equipped directly from inventory, with stats updating instantly and no refreshes.
* Consumables can be consumed (makes sense, right?) from inventory and automatically roll and apply their effects.
* Armor and weapon UI was redesigned for smoother management and searching.
* **200 weapon icons** and **35 armor icon sets** (with tiered variations) have been maticulously mapped to each core Daggerheart item. 
* **Item and consumables icons:** **160+ item** and **consumable** icons were added so every item and consumable has an icon. So pretty... oOOooo... AAaaaAAaa...

# 3) Campaign & Encounter improvements

* Campaigns now have a global Fear tracker that stays synchronized across all linked encounters.
* Players can roll directly inside encounters and still see all of their character details at a glance.
* GMs can now see additional character stats during encounters.
* Dice rolls are fully synchronized between players and GMs, so everyone sees the same results.
* Dice feedback was redesigned to show totals and roll breakdowns instantly.
* You can now roll multiple dice together! Super smooth.
* Characters can now be removed from encounters when needed.
* GMs can send SRD or Homebrew Vault items directly to player inventories
* **Campaign rolls are now synchronized from character sheets.** Players can roll directly from their sheet and the results will appear for the GM (and everyone else) in the campaign page.

>***Upscaling Improvements:*** *we’re now upscaling using a mix of the Core Rule Book guidance and Chris Davidson’s Making Custom Adversaries approach. The upscaled results are now based on the adversary type.*

# 4) Homebrew Vault

* The Homebrew Vault received major UI and UX updates.
* NEW Colossus Builder is now available when creating an adversary. Add segments, their features, and what they're connected to.
* Homebrew creations can be tagged to campaign frames for easier filtering. This will allow you to find the perfect homebrew items for your current frames.
* SRD Lookup search results are now more accurate (Command/Control + K).
* **Icons, icons, icons:** Homebrew Vault now includes **2000+ (!!!) custom handcrafted icons** across adversaries, weapons, armor, items, consumables, and domains. 
* **Domain card art:** domains now have their own icon gallery, and you can attach art to each domain card using a new Image Selector with **400+ images** designed just for domains.
* **Extend Core Domains:** You can select a core domain to attach cards to, letting you expand the base Daggerheart domains even further.

# 5) Campaign Frame Support (new!)

A bunch of new frame-specific tools and systems are now live in the Character Creator:

* **Motherboard:** build your own Ikonis weapons, with 25+ weapon icons, naming, crafting, augment attachment, scrap management, plus icons for each augment and scrap category. (we got a bit carried away, but it's really thematic and fun to use!)
* **The Witherwild:** mark withered tokens on your character with a corrupted Withered tracker.
* **Colossus of the Drylands:** create and manage your mount, including name and description.
* **Beast Feast:** ingredient collector with 100+ beast and bloom icons, a complete ingredient tracker, and a recipe creator (name, ingredients, method, outcome). Sharing recipes with players (and the GM) is coming soon. This was so super fun to make... the ingredient icons look delicious (try not to lick your screen).
* **The Age of Umbra:** deal additional damage for each scar your character has accumulated.
* More support on the way, especially for Campaigns.

# 6) Daggerheart Artist Guild (new!)

We’ve also launched the **Daggerheart Artist Guild.**

It’s a living directory where artists can be discovered by style and portfolio, and where creators can quickly find the right fit for homebrew projects. Artists get a dedicated profile with their gallery and links, and we’ll be spotlighting featured artists in outreach emails to our subscribers.

As always, our marketplace remains strictly AI-free and focused on supporting real creators. If you’re an artist – or know a really great one – applications are now open: [https://heartofdaggers.com/artist-guild/](https://heartofdaggers.com/artist-guild/)

# 7) We are growing...

* Over $23k generated for homebrew creators since August! This is crazy...
* 3500+ Homebrew Vault creations (1,200+ public).
* 700+ campaigns, 3500+ characters, 200+ adventures, and 3,000+ encounters created.

1r0l0m9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r0l0m9/am_i_wasting_my_time_completely_5_ghosted_dates/,Am I wasting my time completely? 5 ghosted dates and a weird talking stage later.,"First off, let me say that I purposely took two years off of dating while I tried to find somewhere to settle and a job that doesn’t make me hate myself. I made it to that point in life. I’m in my late 20s and overall have a really satisfactory life that I enjoy, so dating is something I embarked on with optimism and without rush. 

However, this is TERRIBLE. I talk to these guys, and almost one of the following happens: 

1. I’m immediately sexualized and asked to send inappropriate photos/hook up. 

2. Men ask me on dates and then ghost. 

3. Men ask me on dates and then consider asking me to come over at 10 PM a date and then are genuinely upset when I tell them to get bent.

4. Men are upset when I can’t drop everything on an hours notice to meet up with them and accuse me of not having time for a relationship if I can’t bend to their whim to be available with no notice. 

5. Men try to use me for access to vehicles/experiences. 

There are so many more, but those are consistently happening and I’m exhausted. I have a nice dating profile, appropriate photos, clear descriptions of what I’m looking for, etc. In person meets, I’m always kind and flirty etc. I don’t have a type, talk to a wide range of men, keeping myself open minded. 

Also, don’t get me wrong, I’m not a prude, I love sex as much as the next gal. Im also moderately attractive, on the thicker side but no one has complained historically. 

But I’m looking for more of a connection this go around. Someone planning and showing up for a simple coffee date does not seem like a huge ask… but 6 months in and not one successful coffee date and I’m wondering where the societal bar even is anymore… I know I’m old and these are the left overs but JFC. 

Anyways, just here to ask if this will continue to happen, if maybe I’ve just missed my season and should just give up again. Or if anyone has any advice?

1r0kye5,https://www.reddit.com/r/EVAustralia/comments/1r0kye5/features_in_charging_apps/,Features in charging apps?,"Hey All,

We just picked up our SL7 which we'll mainly charge from home. We do have family we visit multiple times a year about a 250km drive away, so we'll need to use public charging infrastructure to top up for the return leg. We still have a diesel ute which we could use for these long trips, so I did some super basic mathy stuff to get a cost comparison. Assuming I'm gettiing around 22kWh/100km in the SL7 and 9l/100km in my ute (100kph on country B & C roads), I figure the EV will become less economic on fuel cost (not including any other costs) when electricity cost at public chargers goes above 70c/kWh. 

Loaded up the PlugShare, Evie and ChargeFox apps and set myself up an account for each. I was not prepared for the fairly wild price variance per kWh in regional areas. Questions I have now:

* Why does PlugShare not ask for the cost per kWh when checking in? It asks about kW throughput, even though this is going to be vehicle/cable limited with AC charging which seems common in the regions. I would think a $/kWh alongside kW throughput would be very valuable for those planning longer trips. This would also be useful for tracking price increases over time. For instance a lot of regional Evie stations in Vic are about to go from 40c/kWh to 59c/kWh. Still more economical, but a 47% raise. 

* I've only used Evie and ChargeFox apps to date, but neither let you filter or prioritise charging stations based on price per kWh. If I'm doing long distance, price per unit is a big consideration as generally we're not as pressed for time. I'd rather charge at a DC50 charger for an hour and have a decent walk/look around and have a coffee or something than pay double at a DC150 station and be done in 20 min. I get most people probably just want charging speed on long trips, but it'd be good to have those price filtering options so routes can be planned around the desired style of long distance travel.

Anyway, just thought the absence of these sorts of features was interesting given the massive variance in price per kWh out there, especially considering how advanced these apps/networks are at basically every other aspect.",1,1770681284.0,EVAustralia,3,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

we did end up getting back together for awhile, and then ultimately broke up again.

before we broke up the last time he gave me an ultimatum. his parents live an hour and a half south of us and my parents live an hour north, we are basically in the middle. he said that i needed to tell him yes or no on whether or not i was going to move to his hometown in 3-5 years. i told him there was no way i could make that kind of decision right now. he even told me he wanted to move home within 3 years or sooner because he was so homesick and his job was the only thing keeping him here.

one of the times we broke up (our longest breakup, 7 months) he bought a house. it was when we weren't speaking. he bought a house a mile away from me in the other direction of his apartment. i'd say it's even closer than his apartment. he told me he got this house because ""it was a good deal he couldn't pass up"". fast forward, while we're broken up this last time i find out he lost his job. he got fired. he now owes his job $15,000, or $1200/month for an entire year. the one thing that kept him here, he lost. but when we spoke he now said ""i want to be here for at least 5 years. i won't leave unless my parents get sick and i have to take care of them, but they both have to get sick."" i brought up the fact that selling his house makes the most sense because he needs extra money and he wanted to leave so badly anyways. he got offended by this.

he always tells me that if i ever need anything i can call him. i told him how hard it is for me that he is in the area and that he always makes himself available. he got offended by this and basically said ""well if it's so hard for you then don't call me for anything"" and said he wouldn't help me anymore. also this last time we broke up he let me know that he drove by my apartment one day after it snowed and was going to wipe the snow off my car, but my car was already gone.

the thing is is when i spoke to him last (a month ago) he didn't have a job then and had been unemployed for 2 months at that point. he also doesn't have many friends here. he also said a big reason why he wanted to stay here was because he wanted to get well trained at the jujitsu gym he goes to, even though there is a jujitsu gym in his hometown he likes going to too, and he was JUST saying how homesick he was and how he wanted to move home. there are also women at his gym that know how he treated me and would prefer for him to get kicked out, and i don't know how he isn't embarrassed by that.

he also spends nearly every weekend in his hometown, so to me it makes nearly no sense why he stays here since his job was the biggest reason why he was here. he ALSO mentioned that ""we probably wouldn't be able to try again for a year, or two"". so he was still talking about the future. he also said he wouldn't be his ""best self"" for a longgg time. and that we should probably see other people before we try again. i said ""absolutely, that is a huge thing for me. i need to see other people because i would have married you."" to that he basically said that we couldn't talk for at least 6 months, and we should block each other.

i should also say that a few months ago i did break down and tell him i missed him. he called me immediately and we talked about how he missed me too, but we both knew we couldn't be together especially after the debacle he is dealing with now (on top of everything else). he still proceeded to ask me to get coffee with him and i said it wasn't a good idea.

all of this is really confusing. is this not kinda crazy? or am i just crazy for thinking it's crazy? am i bad person for wishing he would sell that damn house and get out of here? sometimes i feel like we are breathing the same air.",1,1770681088.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Dressed in a custom baptismal gown, you see, as Big John was nearly seventeen pounds… they call him Big John for a reason.

Big John was held by his parents, both lifelong Lotharites. The pastor dressed in a robe and stole poured water over the crown of Big John’s head three times, baptizing him in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was no applause, the baby’s head was patted dry and he was about to be carried away so that the service could proceed with scripture reading.

But then it happened.

No one quite understood what was going on as a booming voice rang out “Una forte Rocca e il nostro Dio!” Big John sang in perfect pitch, in the voice of a tenor, in precise Italian. The congregation looked around for speakers, for someone with a microphone. As Big John continued the hymn, the ears of the congregants led their eyes to the baby at the baptismal, who was in fact belting out the Lotharite anthem. There were gasps, shouts of praise which were more common among other types of Protestants, and the grinding of teeth. Well, there was just one person grinding her teeth. But who could be bothered by this sudden outpouring of miraculous talent?

Lauren Stromberg. That’s who.

Lauren Stromberg was a joy to be around. Tall, physically imposing, severe; she directed the choir of the First Lotharite Church of New Winnweiler (Heidelberg Confession) like a drill sergeant. Big John’s voice was simply amazing, but Lauren immediately identified several problems: there were no hymns during a baptism, spontaneity was simply out of the question, and that sounds like… Italian? Too exotic for a Lotharite (Heidelberg Confession) service.

“Il regno suo rimane per l’eternita” Big John held the ending note to the hymn in a bold display of lung capacity. The stunned crowd, some standing, some having fainted, were held in a breathless pause for a brief moment after Big John had concluded the one-song performance. But then they erupted in ecstatic applause. Well, not quite everyone. Actually, everyone except one person.

Lauren Stromberg.

The pastor announced an unscheduled intermission to the service so that everyone could regain their composure. What a buzz the crowd, mostly older folks, were in!

“He must be the reincarnation of Pavarotti!” Lauren heard one woman say.

“What a beautiful language! Why don’t we sing in Italian more often?” Said another. Lauren’s eye twitched when her brain registered that one.

“The miracle of tongues!” Suggested someone else. Oh boy, someone was in need of a reminder of Maxmillian Lothar’s teachings on the acts of the Apostles, and how they had ceased in the first century. It’s in the Heidelberg Confession.

A hurried service resumed after a few minutes, the pastor referring to the impromptu song from a 58-day old child as a “miracle” definitely ground Lauren’s gears. She was stoic as she directed the choir through a well-rehearsed closing hymn. A watchful eye on Big John, who had fallen asleep in his car seat, half-expecting another disturbance during the approved, English-language hymn. Despite the chaotic energy delivered by Big John, the hymn went as planned.

As you may imagine, everyone wanted to see Big John after the service. To quiz his parents, who were as in awe of the event as anyone else, to see him, to touch his little, well… it’s a relative term, hand. Lauren Stromberg intercepted the pastor as he was on his way to see if he could score an audience with Big John.

“Pastor Ludendorfer.” She halted him. “I think it’s appropriate for you to issue a correction to the congregation.

The pastor was accustomed to being stopped by a congregant while he was walking, but this bold interception irked him. He composed himself, masking his frustration as best he could. He wanted to gawk at Big John with everyone else, not pacify Lauren Stromberg in whatever nitpicky complaint she had.

“Thanks for bringing it to my attention. A correction about what though?”

“People are saying that the interrupting, I mean singing, baby, is the reincarnation of some opera singer. Maxmillian Lothar taught quite clearly that reincarnation was incompatible with reformed faith. The Heidelberg Confession clearly outlines”

Pastor Ludendorfer raised his hand and nodded in acknowledgment.

“Yes, I understand. That teaching is very clear. I think sometimes when people are excited they speak without thinking. Whoever said that probably meant that Big John sounded like an opera singer. He does though! Wasn’t that amazing? I have never heard anything like that! He sang like an angel!”

Lauren glared at him, making several mental notes.

“It wasn’t one person; it was several people. I think it requires correction.” She insisted, physically barring Pastor Ludendorfer from passing. She only permitted him to access Big John, who he had to chase (which was easy, Big John didn’t even crawl yet, but his stroller did move quickly), after he had acquiesced to her stern demand masked as a suggestion.

The usual crowd was on time for church the following Sunday. This was not unusual as they were mostly retirees (they were Lotharites after all, I think the average age of the congregation was late sixties). Most were still unhappy with the recent change to a 9 am service, they preferred the original 7:30 start time. Some grumbled that the young Pastor Ludendorfer was being influenced by Pentecostals with the late service. Anyway, the point here is that they were extra motivated to be on time to see if Big John would return this Sunday with his parents. He did. Everyone was so excited to see Big John being strolled in, well almost everyone. Actually only one person wasn’t excited to see Big John.

Lauren Stromberg was not excited to see Big John.

She rolled her eyes so hard that a weaker woman would have hurt her neck. But Lauren was a powerlifter, her squat game was a little weak though. She snapped the choir to attention and began directing them in the opening hymn at exactly 9 o’clock. They had finished the first verse, but the crowd was looking to the back pew, eyes fixed on Big John.

This was going too well, Lauren knew it was too early to relax. As the second verse began, the choir was overpowered by a familiar voice, louder than the choir with all their powers combined.

“Santo, santo, santo! Tutti i santi t’adorano,
deponendo le corone davanti al trono tuo”

Big John sang as beautifully, and as Italian as he had the week before.

The crowd gasped, the choir stopped, Big John continued.

Lauren snapped.

She rapped her conductor’s baton on the music stand and commanded them to begin on the chorus. A few complied, the others stood marveling at Big John’s holy serenade. The organ continued playing, well, organ sounds continued. The congregation did not have an organist, not since Mrs. Gewurztraminer had moved to an assisted living facility last year. The musical accompaniment to the hymn was played from a popular video sharing application.

There was applause when the song ended. There was never applause after a hymn, well, unless Big John just sang it, in Italian.

Boy was this a great introduction to Pastor Ludendorfer’s ten-minute sermon.

“What a wonderful gift we’ve been given, to hear this little one praise the name of our Lord with his beautiful voice. But in our joy, we must be careful to speak the truth. We’re called to remember the clear teachings of scripture, clarified by Maxmillian Lothar, and codified in the Heidelberg Confession. A soul exists in Earth once before judgement. The idea that the soul of anyone who has passed into eternity could come back into a different body is well outside our understanding of the afterlife as outlined in the Heidelberg Confession… and scripture.”

The time for the closing hymn approached. Lauren held out her hand, stopping the choir from approaching. The congregation was confused, there was nothing in the Heidelberg Confession about this.

“There is no need to follow centuries of order and tradition, the little newcomer will just sing for us.”

A cascading gasp spread through the crowd in reaction. Some looked at Lauren in disbelief, others looked back at Big John in anticipation of his next lovely song. Pastor Ludendorfer, with a still-active lapel microphone (and boy was he aware of that since the “burp incident” of 2023), interrupted.

“Choir, could we please have you come to the chancel for the closing hymn?”

They reluctantly resumed their progress. Lauren glared at Ludendorfer furiously. He meekly avoided her intense glare and felt genuine fear.

The organ was a bit delayed in starting, but after it began (well, after someone hit the play button on their phone app) the choir was immediately overpowered by little baby Pavarotti in the back of the church.

“Incoroniamo di corone,
L’Agnel sul Suo splendor!”

The congregation sighed with relief, the choir provided an English backing to the hymn, Lauren stormed out.

No one really noticed her leaving, though she marched down the center aisle and out the main door.

After the congregation was dismissed, they gathered around and fawned over Big John much as before. Pastor Ludendorfer patiently waited for an audience with the silent infant, though his joy was stolen by the looming threat of Lauren Stromberg, with whom he knew an unavoidable encounter loomed.

Michael Wolfgang Ludendorfer snuck out of the church with the main body of departees, highly irregular. He normally listened to the elderly, who were his primary audience, tell him about their prescription medication after a Sunday morning service; but today, he was fleeing from his choir director.

Her car was still in the parking lot! In a mild panic, he hurried to his own car and fled the parking lot while the church was still half full, or half empty, depending on your perspective.

Lauren was already down the road, only a few hundred yards away at the historic Saint Jakob Railroad Park. It consisted of two benches, a tree, and a decommissioned railroad bridge that spanned 38 feet across the Alsenbach Creek. For over seventy years it was used to supply the mill which had polluted the creek, which tragically caught on fire in 1966. The creek caught on fire, not the mill.

Anyway, the cruel November wind blew wisps of Lauren’s hair from her orderly braid as she looked through the dead shrubbery of the embankment down at the barely moving water of the famed creek. She stood in solemn, silent contemplation at the foot of the bridge. Her life’s work had been overshadowed by a spectacle… in Italian no less.

Lost in thought, her situational awareness was also lost.

“You okay there Miss?”

She gasped, spinning around startled to see a sharply dressed gentleman standing a respectful distance away.

Lauren didn’t recognize the man, which was odd for New Winnweiler. Even if she didn’t know someone, she typically at least recognized them. Perhaps he was a visitor and had just come from church. Maybe he saw her leave and followed. That made sense to Lauren.

She took a deep breathe to compose herself. Her cheeks and nose were red from the cold, but she hadn’t shown any indication that she had been crying, because she hadn’t been.

“Yes. I’m fine.”

“It’s not a very high bridge, you know.”

Lauren’s face betrayed her internal reaction, even if her words were measured.

“It was high enough to get corn to the mill for over 70 years.”

The stranger sucked in his lips and nodded, looking past her at the bridge.

“Sure was, but it’s not for corn anymore. I don’t think it’s high enough for much else though.”

“What are you implying?!” Lauren sharply responded, alarmed at the inference.

The man held his palms up toward her as if to deescalate.

“Just thought I’d check and see if you were alright. It’s not too common to see a lady in her Sunday best on a bridge staring at the creek.”

Lauren knew that the stranger knew, her eyes downcast as she deliberated whether or not to tell this seemingly kind person her troubles.

“It’s that singing baby, isn’t it?” He asked.

“I was hoping it was my imagination. But that fat baby really does interrupt the service, doesn’t he?” Lauren blurted, seeking validation. He must have seen her leave the service, she told herself.

“I can help you with the baby.” The stranger said, taking a step forward.

Lauren’s head tilted, warily eying the man and instinctively putting her hand on the pepper spray bottle in her pocket. Lauren pepper-sprayed someone at least once a month.

“I can elevate your choir. I can silence the baby. I can even help you to out-sing that baby. In Italian, heck, even Latin if you”

Lauren’s eye twitched at the suggestion she sing in Italian, and Latin was the final straw.

“We must avoid and shun all idolatry, sorcery, superstitious rites, and invoke the one true God only!”

She quoted the Heidelberg Confession. And that serpent of old, Satan, the Devil, was overcome.

Well, either that or the blast of pepper spray that Lauren delivered to his eyeballs from inches away. He held his jacket over his eyes as he fled blindly into traffic to be hit by a freelance delivery driver. Lauren was in hot pursuit but veered away as the stranger lay mangled in the street and jogged lightly to her car in the church parking lot.

I am going to out-sing that fat baby. Lauren thought to herself, dabbing her forehead with a napkin as she sat in her car. She grabbed a fresh bottle of pepper spray from the glove box and replaced the used can in her pocket.

Pastor Ludendorfer’s heart skipped a beat the next morning when he arrived at the First Lotharite Church of New Winnweiler (Heidelberg Confession) and saw Lauren Stromberg’s car in the parking lot.

He spoke the words of Maxmillian Lothar aloud, but quietly as he exited his vehicle and walked, slowly, to the church.

“Dear God,
Protect me from sin, error, and unsolicited theological corrections.
Grant me the swiftness outlined in the Heidelberg Confession Article 17, Note B,
where it says to flee evil swiftly,
Guard my tongue,
strengthen my spine,
and conceal me if possible.
Amen.”

An angelic voice greeted him from the sanctuary as he entered. Lauren Stromberg was in front of the chancel, where she was accustomed to directing the choir from, singing beautifully. Maybe not quite as beautifully as Big John, but quite nicely at least.

Pastor Ludendorfer chose wisely to not interrupt Lauren’s solitary practice and went about his normal Monday morning business.

Lauren trained like a Navy SEAL… of singing, all week. Each day her voice grew shakier, more hoarse. But she refused to coddle her vocal cords. She would defeat Big John fair and square, or she would die trying.

She barely slept Saturday night, and rather than fighting vainly against consciousness, she rose early and prepared herself for battle.

“Rrrrrroll your Rrrrrrs for the Lorrrrrrd!” She woke her tired vocal cords, compressing her sore diaphragm with her fists. She was as ready as she ever would be.

The first at church, she analyzed the acoustics from her position against those of where the fat baby sat with his parents. Too bad Lotharites don’t believe in church nurseries, she thought, this could have all been avoided. But Lauren was never one to back down from a fight, not even a fight with a fat baby.

It was 8:58 am when Big John’s parents strolled into church. So much for the virtue of punctuality extolled in the Heidelberg Confession. Lauren had already been there for hours, to the prepared goes the glory, that’s what Maxmillian Lothar had said.

The organ music announcing the opening verse Be Still My Soul. All eyes turned to Big John, who was sitting smugly, according to Lauren, in the back pew with his parents and their contraband coffee.

Lauren unveiled her secret weapon. No, not pepper spray, although she had considered it. A microphone, which she held to her mouth and sang into, competing with but not overpowering Big John as he began singing.

“Sii calma, o cuor,
confida nel Signor”

Many, but not all, eyes turned to Lauren, who had never before used a microphone while directing the choir. Lauren’s voice cracked, then it squeaked. She threw the microphone down with a horrible amplified crashing noise as Big John continued the hymn. She ran, undignified, unlike the week before, through the crowded church, pepper spraying Michael Wolfgang Ludendorfer in the eyes with alarming precision as she ran from the church straight to the historic Saint Jakob Railroad Park. Steam escaping her mouth in the cold morning air, still over Alsenbach Creek, as she gazed down to the water which seemed to call to her.

The Sun broke through the dark clouds, and she felt like it was shining just on her as a warm gust blew up the embankment from under the bridge.

“Devil?” She called out. “I need you now!”",1,1770680976.0,shortstory,0,1.0,False

Yet they woke up each morn and drank coffee by dew

And as the sun set and the moon ruled the skies

They’d tilt their head up with a gleam in their eyes

Dozing off into slumber, sheep jumped in their head

A distant wish called as the Universe listened

Down flew a Seraph who shone and glistened

Silently sleeping within hushed state of rest

Light of golden and prism lit up and danced in their room

For their character and exertion would see fruition bloom

Then came the daybreak, sunlit heavens crystal blue

I ended up finishing 44 books across fiction, non-fiction, and self-improvement genres.

Here's everything that worked, everything that failed, and the surprising lessons I learned about reading in 2024.

What DIDN'T work:

Speed reading techniques are BS. All those speed reading methods online are mostly garbage. I spent weeks trying different techniques and apps (tried several on both iOS and Android), but faster reading meant worse comprehension. Sometimes slower is actually faster.

Reading only self-improvement books. I burned out hard trying to read only ""productive"" books. By month 6, **I was forcing myself through business and self-improvement titles that felt like homework. Variety is crucial for sustained reading.**

Digital-only reading. I'm a tech person, so I started with just Kindle and reading apps on my phone. While convenient, I found myself getting distracted by notifications and other apps. Physical books kept me focused longer.

What ACTUALLY worked:

The 25% rule. If I wasn't engaged after 25% of any book, I'd quit and move on. This single rule increased my completion rate dramatically. Life's too short for boring books.

Mixed format approach

* Physical books for deep focus sessions
* Audiobooks for commutes and walks
* E-books (iOS Kindle app) for travel
* Summary apps only for books I'd already read to review key points

Genre rotation system. I alternated between fiction, non-fiction, biography, and self-improvement books. This kept reading fresh and prevented burnout from any single category.

Note-taking apps integration. I used Obsidian (available on both Android and iOS) to create connected notes between books. Linking ideas across different books created deeper understanding than reading in isolation.

Morning reading ritual. 30-45 minutes every morning with coffee before checking any apps or social media. This became a sacred time that I protected fiercely.

Podcasts as book replacements. I love podcasts and using them as content was pretty good. I especially liked it when people talked about their experience on how they applied the book.

Podcast supplementation (the right way). Instead of replacing books with podcasts, I found podcasts where authors discussed their books in detail. This reinforced learning without replacing the deep reading experience.

Reading 40+ books taught me that the goal isn't consuming more content it's building a better thinking system. The best self-improvement comes from deeply understanding fewer ideas rather than superficially knowing many. It's better to read 10 good books again and again than to read 100 books without understanding any of its principles.

For anyone starting their reading journey: **Forget the apps promising shortcuts. Get comfortable books in whatever format works for you, quit the boring ones ruthlessly, and focus on understanding over speed.**

I'm happy to share specific strategies that worked for me.",11,1770680266.0,nonfictionbookclub,3,0.79,False

I notice on pin days I get the jitters and mild anxiety which seems to last the day. Feels like I had too much coffee. thinking maybe sub q might smooth this out anyone have experience with this?

Also my e2 always runs high. No real sides from it apart from the mild anxiety on pin days. Anyone find sub q helped with that also?

If I picked a coffee shop for a 7/7:30am business strategy and chat, would anyone show up?? A similar group in Columbus was called Emerging Entrepreneurs - where you could talk through ideas, problems, and solutions.

1r0kerg,https://www.reddit.com/r/GTAIV/comments/1r0kerg/i_refuse_to_kill_vlad/,I refuse to kill Vlad,"First up: I’ve 100% the game before, now I’m playing through with a combo of a roleplaying and AnyAustin-just-looking-at-stuff mentality.

The Albanian loan sharks are dead, and Vlad isn’t bothering me about new jobs so I’m assuming my debts are paid. The only reason to do the next mission and kill Vlad would be because Mallorie is seeing him, and Roman’s jealous. That sucks for Roman, but I’m trying to leave that violent life behind me! And besides, Vlad’s kinda funny.

Vlad and I have a mutual adversarial respect for each be other. I stare him down when he yells at me to make him coffee, then he makes me coffee. He makes sure Mallorie tells Roman I’m ok. I busts his balls, he busts em back, we all have a good laugh. 

Not to mention, I love Little Jacob, but whenever we hang out I’m laying waste to people. 4 men in Schottler, run down another 3 in Willis, another 5 in Meadow Park. Blood on my hands! My boy Vlad’s got no need of dead people in debt. Those are the cleanest jobs I can get, besides cabbing.

Which brings us to the end. I don’t need access to Alderney, or even Algonquin. I got three incredibly detailed boroughs to explore. (Let Luis and the Biker explore those other areas.) Lemme get my money the honest way, learning these city streets, meeting fine folks. I’ll be a Cabbie working under Roman. Mohammed can tell rumors about my dark history, but that’s all in the past. 

I’ve got a girlfriend who’s suspiciously enamored with me. Roman never gets gunned down at his wedding. I’ve got this new friend to hotbox with. And when I’m not driving cab, I’m exploring this fucked up city. In peace. The only blood I intend to spill is that of those filthy pigeons. ",27,1770679921.0,GTAIV,10,0.94,False
