It‚Äôs definitely going better than in the beginning. Around the 3-month mark I hit a bit of a peak, and I‚Äôve been trying to focus on new hobbies (this week I even tried salsa classes!) and spending time with friends who give me the space to talk about the breakup. That has been really healing. On the flip side, some friends weren‚Äôt as open to these conversations, which caused friction. Still, I can see some progress! I‚Äôve gotten much closer with the people who¬†*are*¬†there for me.

While writing and reflecting, I realized that I was a big part of the problem in the relationship. I‚Äôm the one who ended things, but I regret doing it for the wrong reasons. I had been overworked and overwhelmed for a long time, and I put too much of that weight onto the relationship. Problems that felt huge back then seem more solvable now. Since quitting my demanding job, I feel more like myself again. I try to forgive myself for how I handled things, but it still brings up shame.

I‚Äôve messaged my ex twice since the breakup, and every day feels like a battle not to reach out again. I def should stop looking at his online status, but thats very hard sometimes. We‚Äôll probably meet for coffee in the next weeks or months. My intent is just to catch up and be genuinely interested in him, without putting pressure on myself to make a big decision. But deep down, my body still feels like it‚Äôs fighting for the relationship, and I‚Äôm afraid of saying too much too soon. I would consider myself i have a anxious attachment style.

Thanks for reading. Has anyone else struggled with this balance between wanting connection and trying not to overwhelm yourself or your ex? Any tips?",1,1758795013.0,nocontact,0,1.0,False
1nq2tn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No_Definition_8887/comments/1nq2tn9/my_doctor_told_me_its_all_in_your_head_he_was_so/,My doctor told me ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs all in your head.‚Äô He was so wrong.,"I usually don‚Äôt post rants, but I need to get this off my chest. For years, I‚Äôve been suffering with hypothyroid symptoms that were ruining my life - and my doctor kept telling me I was fine. *‚ÄúYour thyroid levels are normal. Maybe you‚Äôre just stressed. Maybe you should exercise more,‚Äù* blah blah. I felt so dismissed. Meanwhile I was barely functioning: falling asleep at my desk, forgetting what I was saying mid-conversation (hello, brain fog), and crying out of sheer frustration at least once a week. I gained 30 lbs in a year, my hair was thinning‚Ä¶ but sure, I‚Äôm ‚Äúfine.‚Äù üôÑ

Has anyone else been told their symptoms are in their head? It‚Äôs the worst feeling ever. I finally hit a breaking point when I nearly fell asleep driving home one day. I could have died. That was it for me - I decided I had to take control beyond what my doctor was doing.

Through a friend (and hours of late-night Googling), I discovered [Colorlife, a Vitamin A + Iodine supplement aimed at thyroid support](https://www.colorlifevitamin.com/products/colorlife-vitamin-a-iodine-sublingual-spray-for-thyroid-support). I was hesitant - I worried it was just another gimmick. But I figured it‚Äôs natural and safe, so what did I have to lose? I started using [Colorlife](https://www.colorlifevitamin.com/products/colorlife-vitamin-a-iodine-sublingual-spray-for-thyroid-support) spray each day, *on top of* switching to a new doctor who actually listened (also important!).

Within a couple of weeks, I noticed something I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time: real energy. I could get through the day without 5 cups of coffee. My brain fog eased up; I was actually *present* again instead of drifting through a haze. Even some depression lifted - I was laughing again, actually *wanting* to do things. Over a month or two, I even shed a bit of that stubborn weight (no drastic diet, just moving more because I finally could).

I cannot describe how validating it felt to finally improve after being told nothing was wrong. It wasn‚Äôt all in my head. My body needed support, and once it got it, the change was night and day. [Colorlife](https://www.colorlifevitamin.com/products/colorlife-vitamin-a-iodine-sublingual-spray-for-thyroid-support) was a big piece of that puzzle for me. It gave my thyroid the boost it desperately needed when standard treatment wasn‚Äôt enough.

I‚Äôm sharing this here because if even one person reading this has gone through what I did - feeling crazy, unheard, and miserable - please know *you‚Äôre not crazy*. And you‚Äôre not alone. There are things out there that can help. For me it was this supplement (you can find it online, just search [Colorlife](https://www.colorlifevitamin.com/products/colorlife-vitamin-a-iodine-sublingual-spray-for-thyroid-support) thyroid and you‚Äôll see it). For you it might be something else - maybe a different med combo or lifestyle change - but don‚Äôt give up fighting for yourself.

Also, find a doctor who listens! That, plus my daily [Colorlife](https://www.colorlifevitamin.com/products/colorlife-vitamin-a-iodine-sublingual-spray-for-thyroid-support) routine, has literally given me my life back. I wake up feeling human, and I have the labs *and* the renewed smile to prove it. 

If you‚Äôre in the same boat I was, feel free to reach out or comment. I‚Äôm happy to share more about what I did or just validate that what you‚Äôre feeling is REAL. Hang in there, thyroid warriors. üí™üíú",1,1758794957.0,u_No_Definition_8887,0,1.0,False

I have no routine, or am even anti routine. Doing the same thing same time two days in a roll makes me uneasy. Not to mention structures enforced by external forces and from necessity, like school and work. If there's no chaos, I induce it. I have explored so much of my own city and tried so much food during my brief time of working. My repetition is the obsession with not repeating.

Whilst, I am certainly rigid. I don't know what I will do, but making me do what I do *not* want to do throw off my feelings. I'm just sitting around waiting for intention and motivation to fall from the sky, and if I want a coffee now, better no one stops it heads on.

A family friend was due to model but has unfortunately had some last-minute changes, so we're hoping someone in the community might know a parent or grandparent who would enjoy this experience.

For total peace of mind, we are happy to provide the full details of our company and speak with a family member or carer beforehand. The safety and comfort of our model is our absolute top priority.

It‚Äôs like my nervous system ‚Äúswitched on‚Äù, I already know either tonight or tomorrow I will get a huge crash (physical fatigue), brain fog and possibly panic attacks. I was just wondering what are some low effort meals I can eat that are (semi-)healthy and will not worsen the fatigue. I will not be able to cook, but I do care about my health. My skin has also been a huge insecurity so I was trying to fix that a little bit by eating healthier, but sometimes that seems impossible with how I‚Äôm feeling.
And how do you guys do personal hygiene when you‚Äôre crashing? Showering takes a lot of my energy. If any of you have advice to keep daily tasks low effort, I‚Äôd appreciate it. Just trying to get through this..",2,1758794358.0,cfs,0,1.0,False

- Our Beloved Summer ü•∞ü•∞
- Business Proposal (international adaption not for me ü§£)

1nq2mzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/housekeeping/comments/1nq2mzk/im_getting_annoyed_by_the_demands/,I'm getting annoyed by the demands.,"Let me start by saying that I clean for this family 5 days a week. 
The house is a DISASTER 
Every. Single. Day. 
And every day, I'm doing the same thing. Not just cleaning up the children's mess but the adults as well.
The espresso machine is left absolutely filthy. Coffee grinds spilled everywhere. 
The stove top is cleaned daily, now covered with splattered oil and spills/food everywhere. 
Dishes do not get rinsed. They are left piled for me. 
Diapers left on the floor or even chewed up diapers left for me to clean up... 
Literally, I could go on and on. 
I do ALL the laundry for this family, fold and put away.

 Okay fine, I don't mind the duties, it's the mess that I mind because I feel like a maid at this point.


The duties in addition that I'm getting asked to do are organizing, organizing the pantry. Organizing the closets in room. Cleaning the fridge. Cleaning the bathrooms. (keep in mind all of these things are filthy by the time they ask me to do them) Washing the couch covers and putting them on (a bloody nightmare) Mopping the area where their dogs frequently pee. 

Just an example, say they are throwing something into the trash and they miss. They literally leave it there. Same applies to bathroom trash. 

I want to scream it into the void. I leave this house tidy every day.
Only to show up to a home that looks like a tornado ran through it. Clothes left scattered in kids room, the adults leaving their clothes and shoes piled everywhere. Drinks scattered about. Literally the adults are just as messy as the children. Ughhhh...

I need this job. 
If I could get more cleaning clients , I could probably soley do my side hustle of cleaning on my own full time. 
Instead, I'm over here being a family's b****, I mean servant. ü§£

1nq2gx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivatePackets/comments/1nq2gx9/free_vpns_for_your_iphone_are_they_worth_it/,Free VPNs for your iPhone: Are they worth it?,"In the quest for online privacy on your iPhone or iPad, a VPN is a powerful tool. It encrypts your connection and masks your IP address, offering a layer of security and anonymity. The App Store is filled with ""free"" VPNs promising digital freedom without the price tag. But as the old saying goes, if you're not paying for the product, **you are the product**. This article cuts through the noise to find out which free VPNs are trustworthy and when it's time to open your wallet for a paid service.

# The best free options that won't sell your data

While many free VPNs are risky, a few reputable providers offer legitimate ""freemium"" services. These are limited versions of their paid products, designed to give you a taste of real privacy without compromising your security. Here are the top contenders.

* **Proton VPN:** This is the undisputed champion for one simple reason: **unlimited free data**. Coming from the security-focused team behind Proton Mail, their free plan is a standout. While you can't choose your specific server location (it connects you to the fastest available in one of five countries), you can browse without ever worrying about hitting a data cap. Users and experts consistently praise it as the best free option, noting that it doesn't noticeably slow down your internet.
* **Windscribe:** A very generous runner-up, Windscribe offers a solid **10GB of data per month** on its free plan if you confirm your email. Unlike Proton, it lets you choose from servers in 10 different countries. The free version includes access to many of the same features as the paid plan, including an ad and tracker blocker called R.O.B.E.R.T.
* **TunnelBear:** Known for its charming design and user-friendly interface, TunnelBear is great for VPN beginners. Its free plan offers a more modest **2GB of data per month**. Its biggest advantage is providing free users access to its **entire server network across 47 countries**, something most free providers restrict.

# What's the catch with ""free""?

Running a secure VPN service requires a massive investment in servers, software, and maintenance. So, how do shady free VPNs make money? Often, it's in ways that directly contradict the reason you wanted a VPN in the first place.

* **Your data is for sale:** The most common business model for questionable free VPNs is to log your browsing history, IP address, and other personal information and sell it to advertisers and data brokers.
* **Malware risks:** Some free VPN apps come bundled with malicious software or intrusive ad trackers that can infect your device and steal your data.
* **Weak security:** Many free services use outdated or weak encryption, leaving your data vulnerable to being intercepted, especially on public Wi-Fi.
* **Poor performance:** To push you toward a paid upgrade, free VPNs often suffer from overcrowded servers, resulting in painfully slow speeds and unreliable connections.

Choosing a reputable provider like the ones mentioned above helps you avoid these serious risks. Their business model is based on converting free users into paying customers, not selling your data.

# A unique look: what free vs. paid really gets you

|Feature|What you get with a good **free VPN**|What you get with a **paid VPN**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Privacy Goal**|Securing your connection on public Wi-Fi for short periods; basic IP masking.|Making privacy a consistent part of your daily online life; serious anonymity and security.|
|**Data Allowance**|A limited monthly budget (like 10GB) or unlimited data with other restrictions. It's enough for browsing, but not for heavy streaming or downloading.|**Truly unlimited data.** Stream, download, and browse as much as you want without thinking about a cap.|
|**Entertainment**|You might get lucky and access some geo-blocked content, but streaming platforms actively block most free VPN servers. Access is unreliable at best.|**Optimized for streaming.** Paid VPNs have dedicated servers that reliably unblock platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and BBC iPlayer from anywhere in the world.|
|**Speed & Performance**|Your internet speed will likely take a noticeable hit. Servers can be crowded, leading to slower browsing and buffering.|**Fast, stable connections.** Paid services invest in high-performance servers, often using modern protocols like WireGuard to ensure minimal speed loss.|
|**Security Toolkit**|Basic, strong encryption and a no-logs policy (from a reputable provider). This is the essential foundation.|**A full security suite.** This includes advanced features like a kill switch (which cuts internet access if the VPN drops), multi-hop servers (for extra encryption), and built-in ad and malware blockers.|

# The side-by-side comparison

Here‚Äôs a more traditional look at how the best free options stack up against a typical paid service.

|Feature|Proton VPN Free|Windscribe Free|TunnelBear Free|Typical Paid VPN|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Monthly Data Limit**|**Unlimited**|10 GB|2 GB|Unlimited|
|**Server Locations**|5 Countries (auto-select)|10 Countries|47 Countries|100+ Countries|
|**Speed**|Medium (can be throttled)|Medium to Fast|Slower|Very Fast|
|**Streaming Support**|No|Limited|No|Yes, optimized|
|**Simultaneous Devices**|1|Unlimited|Unlimited|5-10+|
|**Advanced Features**|No|Ad-blocker|No|Kill Switch, Ad-blocker, etc.|

# So, should you pay for a VPN?

For light, occasional use‚Äîlike securing your connection at a coffee shop or for a quick browsing session‚Äîa reputable free VPN like **Proton VPN is an excellent choice**. It provides a legitimate, safe service without asking for your credit card.

However, if you're serious about your digital privacy, want to stream content from around the world, or need a fast and reliable connection for gaming or downloading, **a paid VPN is a necessary investment (**[**here are some of the best ones**](https://privatepackets.club/2025/05/01/top-5-vpns-april-2025-pricing-and-deals-guide/)**)**.

It‚Äôs definitely going better than in the beginning. Around the 3-month mark I hit a bit of a peak, and I‚Äôve been trying to focus on new hobbies (this week I even tried salsa classes!) and spending time with friends who give me the space to talk about the breakup. That has been really healing. On the flip side, some friends weren‚Äôt as open to these conversations, which caused friction. Still, I can see some progress! I‚Äôve gotten much closer with the people who *are* there for me.

While writing and reflecting, I realized that I was a big part of the problem in the relationship. I‚Äôm the one who ended things, but I regret doing it for the wrong reasons. I had been overworked and overwhelmed for a long time, and I put too much of that weight onto the relationship. Problems that felt huge back then seem more solvable now. Since quitting my demanding job, I feel more like myself again. I try to forgive myself for how I handled things, but it still brings up shame.

I‚Äôve messaged my ex twice since the breakup, and every day feels like a battle not to reach out again. I def should stop looking at his online status, but thats very hard sometimes. We‚Äôll probably meet for coffee in the next weeks or months. My intent is just to catch up and be genuinely interested in him, without putting pressure on myself to make a big decision.

1nq2ew7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nq2ew7/my_marriage_is_struggling_after_getting_married/,My marriage is STRUGGLING after getting married at 20 years old,"I F21 got married to my husband M24 about a year and a half ago. Even the day of our wedding was a disaster. We started dating at 18 and 21 and were long distance for two years before we got married. Looking at it now, we completely rushed it. I felt pressure to get married young because of religious purposes and he went along with it. Our marriage has been nothing short of problems. I‚Äôll list out a couple out. We have no intimate life, he had loads of half naked girls saved on his instagram and twitter, he is private about his money and savings (he has a lot of money from his mother who passed away when he was a child & investing), he basically keeps everything separate. i don‚Äôt even know how much he has. he is constantly name calling or having an attitude with me, he insisted his older father live with us when we got married bc he was sick but the kicker is, his dad had no idea we were married. me and my husband eloped and he had told me that he knew what was going on but he never told him. i obviously eventually realized he didn‚Äôt know and he had me keep the secret from him for over a year. he is also extremely controlling with finances. we just have terrible communication with each other and he really angers me mostly due to the name calling and his constant miserable attitude. he has ruined my credit score and we are constantly spending our money from our paychecks to the point where we have nothing left. i guess he‚Äôs fine doing that bc he has savings but i have nothing and no access to his money. he‚Äôs so weird about it. i sometimes get tips from work and i keep that for myself usually but recently he has expected me to use it on gas or things like coffee for us. his reasoning is that he uses all of his spending money on me so I should be able to spend my money on things we need or on things for us. to me it makes no sense bc he has so much money. i should be allowed to keep my tips for myself BECAUSE I DONT HAVE ANY SAVINGS. it‚Äôs so beyond frustrating yet i don‚Äôt want to leave him? we obviously have some serious problems but i can never get myself to leave. anytime there‚Äôs a good moment it‚Äôs like my brain gets wiped of all of the bad things. i have attempted to leave but i never follow through. i feel crazy sometimes. we just started marriage counseling but i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs really going to help. i still love him and i think he loves me but maybe im just young, naive, and stupid. i really don‚Äôt know what will make me leave or what‚Äôs too much. i think ive always told myself i wouldn‚Äôt leave unless something big happens like infidelity. not really sure what the point of this post is. i just need help navigating this.

You know, that awkward creaky sound that feels like it's signaling, ""You‚Äôre getting old!""? Yeah, I hear you! 

I‚Äôm here to share a quick mobility routine that‚Äôll have you feeling less like the tin man and more like a smooth, flexible‚Ä¶ well, you get the idea! It's only **5 minutes** long, and trust me, you *can* spare that time, even if you‚Äôre binge-watching your favorite show. 

**So why does a 5-minute mobility routine matter?** 

- **Instant Relief:** Just like that first sip of coffee in the morning, moving can wake your body up! 
- **Prevention is Key:** Regular mobility work can help you ward off those pesky injuries. You want to be dancing at your kid‚Äôs wedding, right? 
- **Feel Good Factor:** It‚Äôs like giving your joints a well-deserved spa day!

**Let‚Äôs dive in! Here‚Äôs a quick routine you can do anywhere:**

1. **Neck Rolls:** 
   - Drop your head to one side, roll it forward, and back to the other side. Repeat a few times. Feels good, right?
  
2. **Shoulder Shrugs:** 
   - Lift your shoulders to your ears, hold for a second, then drop them like you just heard something outrageous. *Let it all go!*

3. **Cat-Cow Stretch:** 
   - Get on all fours, arch your back like a cat stretching and then drop your belly and lift your head. It‚Äôs like giving your spine a little hug. 

4. **Hip Openers:**
   - Stand up and lift one knee as high as you can, then open it outwards. Repeat. Makes you feel like a majestic flamingo, even if you look more like a confused one. 

5. **Ankle Flexes:** 
   - Stand still and wiggle your toes while flexing your ankles. Imagine you‚Äôre stirring a giant pot of soup‚Äîwhat a delicious metaphor!

Did I mention these exercises take hardly any time? Just five minutes! Think about it: You might be spending more time scrolling through TikTok. And let's be honest, wouldn't you rather be doing something that feels *refreshing* instead?

**Bonus Tip:** Try doing these exercises before you dive into that couch-cushioned abyss. You‚Äôll thank me later! 

And let‚Äôs keep the camaraderie going! üí™ We all know how important it is to stay active, and when we band together, we make it easier to hold each other accountable. If you're interested in tools/links that suggest how to keep moving, I found something that might tickle your fancy. *We believe in strongest people.* [Check it out here!](https://mavely.app.link/e/aCtf6hngjUb)

1nq2dy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nq2dy8/aio_for_wanting_to_step_back_from_an_almost_10/,AIO for wanting to step back from an almost 10 year friendship?,"So I (22F) have been best friends with this girl (22F) since we were in middle school and we have always gotten along, never had any fights or real arguments. Our friendship even survived us going to different colleges for 4 years, but lately I‚Äôve been noticing her behavior and tone with me more. When I talk about friends that were past coworkers in a casual conversation, she‚Äôll say things like it‚Äôs not like they are my actual friends and have some sort of reaction after I tell her who I‚Äôm referring to. She‚Äôs never met these people either. 
I also feel like she never puts effort into our friendship. I always ask her to go out and do stuff with me but she never asks if I want to hang out. She takes so long to answer messages even when she was unemployed and not in school. 
I drive us everywhere and when I‚Äôm talking to her she‚Äôs always on her phone and I constantly have to repeat myself when she asks ‚Äúwait what did you say?‚Äù And when I asked her what‚Äôs up with that, she told me that she usually just toons me out. Now when I‚Äôm driving and talking to her and I look over and see her on her phone, I just want to stop talking cause it‚Äôs not worth it anymore.
 Tonight was kind of my breaking point because I have a great opportunity to get my dream job and it would mean a really nice salary and I was talking with my brother(26M) and coworker(56M) about wanting to save heavily so I can put a down payment on a house by the beginning of 2027 and they both thought it was a great idea but when I told my best friend she kind of shit on the idea completely and seemed to think it wasn‚Äôt doable for me. When I told her that I was determined to make it happen, she had a sarcastic tone and said ‚Äúwell I hope you make it happen‚Äù. During this we went to get coffee and on our way back we got into a conversation about speeding and how people usually go 70 on a 35mph road, including her and I told her that was stupid and people who do that deserve to get a ticket, especially cause it‚Äôs a busy road both with cars and pedestrians. She made a comment about how if I were a cop and pulled someone over for even going 50 in and 35, that I would be dealing with a bunch of angry people and that I better hope I don‚Äôt have a gun pulled on me. The whole thing had just left me feeling unsure on if the friendship is even worth continuing since it only seems to be going downhill. I feel like every other time I hang out with her, I have the same unsure feeling. I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm just going to take a step back and focus on my life and getting to my goal but I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm over reacting for wanting to pull back.",0,1758793312.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.5,False

1nq2agt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1nq2agt/separation_woke_me_up_men_carry_it_all_women_cash/,"Separation woke me up: men carry it all, women cash the cheque","[I posted a little while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/s/xObiyEfVw2) reflecting on some of the upside I‚Äôve experienced since separating. Whilst I‚Äôm continuing to build confidence and continue to bounce back and charge on with improved mental health, and better, more fulfilling relationships, I do find myself being dragged back in the mud to wrestle with the pig that is my ex-wife.

I used to dismiss the ‚Äúman-osphere‚Äù as toxic nonsense. But after my separation, I can‚Äôt deny it: the core of what they say is seemingly right.

For over a decade, I worked myself to the bone to provide. Full-time career, long hours, relentless pressure. My wife? She ‚Äúchose‚Äù part-time work, even though full-time roles were available. Why? Because she wanted the lifestyle. Coffee dates with friends. Long walks and gym/yoga classes. Designer clothes. Expensive homewares. ‚ÄúStatement‚Äù furniture. Big trips and holidays that had to be extraordinary. And of course, the big house on the hill. I didn‚Äôt call it out, I just kept chugging along because I thought that was what a good husband does. ‚ÄúHappy wife, happy life‚Äù.

Meanwhile, I was breaking inside. Mental health shot to pieces. I opened up, acknowledged my flaws, asked for support. I sought individual therapy. I begged for couples counselling. I admitted my bad behaviours and tried to change. She hesitated. Half-heartedly attended therapy. Wouldn‚Äôt talk about intimacy and other hard topics. Wouldn‚Äôt engage.

And the sex? Gone. Once her boxes were ticked ‚Äî the wedding, the reception, the house, the kids ‚Äî it dried up. My needs didn‚Äôt matter anymore.

To be fair, she‚Äôs not evil. She‚Äôs a good mum, cares deeply about the kids, has strong values, and a great community spirit. But when push came to shove, her comfort, her image, and her wants always came before my wellbeing. That‚Äôs not partnership, that‚Äôs extraction.

Now we have separated and work towards divorce the mask has slipped even further. Petty acts, like taking the toilet brushes, the doormats (my garden weed puller!) when she moved out. I‚Äôm still carrying the bills, the responsibility, and the fallout ‚Äî while she rewrites the story of our marriage to cast herself as the saint.

Here‚Äôs the uncomfortable truth: men don‚Äôt just get the short end of the stick in marriage - we are the stick. Society expects us to provide, protect, fix, and sacrifice for everyone else. Women get to choose when and how they engage. They can tap out when it doesn‚Äôt suit them, and the system applauds them for ‚Äúfinding themselves.‚Äù

The man-osphere gets demonised, but strip away the noise and they‚Äôre exposing the imbalance nobody wants to admit. Men are disposable. Our responsibility is mandatory. Women‚Äôs responsibility is optional.

I love my kids. I‚Äôd go through fire for them. But I‚Äôve learned the hard way: for men, marriage is a rigged game. The moment you stop meeting her material or emotional checklist, you‚Äôre either ignored or discarded. And when it ends, you‚Äôre left carrying the can ‚Äî plus the blame.

So yeah, laugh at the man-osphere all you like. I did too. Until life proved them right.

1nq25ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/bugbounty/comments/1nq25ya/bug_bounty_isnt_just_skills_its_mindset/,Bug bounty isn‚Äôt just skills ‚Äî it‚Äôs mindset,"Hello hackers and bug bounty hunters I want to share a personal experience about why mindset matters as much as skills.
For a long time I struggled. While doing bug bounty I got angry, frustrated, and overwhelmed. I kept missing even the smallest bugs and thought I wasn‚Äôt smart enough. It felt like everyone else was making fat paychecks and finding bugs faster than me. That pressure built up and eventually I burned out. My learning slowed, and what had been a hobby I loved started to feel like a chore.
Recently I rewatched¬†Mr. Robot¬†(the first season). There‚Äôs a scene where Elliot caugt a owner of a coffee shop who hase been doing ellegal stuff online and that owner offered him money to keep quiet. Elliot says he doesn‚Äôt care about the money and that hit me. I realized I didn‚Äôt start hacking for money. I started because I love breaking systems, finding vulnerabilities, and learning how things work.
After that realization things got a lot easier. The pressure eased. Now when I work on bug bounty I don‚Äôt stress about finding something or making cash. I just experiment, polish my skills, and enjoy the process. My passion didn‚Äôt just come back ‚Äî it grew. Now I chase skills, not money.
So don‚Äôt fall into the money trap like I did. Remember why you chose hacking: because you love it, not because of the paycheck.",0,1758792431.0,bugbounty,2,0.33,False

The sea, now still, was empty of life. The howling wind echoed through the still vessel, like the mournful cries of a lost sea soul. Its haunting calls were only adding to the surrealism of the wintery night. I sat, isolated on my boat, with a lone rod dipping through the oceanic surface. My line has been still for eons, my soul the same. I stood, setting my rod against the weathered hull of my boat. My legs grew tired from stagnation. I began pacing, hoping to warm my cold corpse of a body. ""I need coffee,"" I thought. I headed for the hold and rummaged through, looking for all I would need to craft my hearty beverage. A new sound caught my attention. This was not of the wind, or boat, or even the ocean. But of a woman, singing, whailing a sorrowful tune. 

My heart ached for her, my soul teared. My eyes wondered through the inky black, searching for the source, hoping to see the heartbroken woman. I could not. I was surrounded by an impenetrable darkness. I returned to the hold, now in search of a lantern. The singing grew louder, now masking the sounds of the wind. I'd managed to find a quaint propane lamp, one gifted to me by my late lover. Seeing it drew my heart aches, adding to the sorrow felt by the crys of the woman. I sparked the flame within, lighting my cigarette as well. Its smoke warmed me within, with the lamp warming most everything else. The singing grew in volume, giving me the idea to move forward. ""Hello?"" I called out. My words echoed through the darkness. One could almost see it pierce through. I received no response. ""Are you in need of assistance?"" I called once more. Now the singing had stopped, my heart began pacing. Sweat drew across my brow, and it sat over my upper lip. 

Was the woman ok? Did something happen. I had questions brought on by morbid curiosity. I yearned for answers, and I craved comprehension. I set sail forward towards where I last heard the mournful sorrows of the woman. I cut through mounds of darkness, the lone lamp being my only source of sight. There was nothing but the howls of the wind, the singing had seized. I called out again, ""Hello. If you need assistance, I will take you back to shore if needed. "" My voice now grew with concern. ""Did she perish in the cold,"" I thought, dismissing it as quick as it came. The singing started again, louder, more present. ""Fair lady, I mean no harm. I am but a lone fisherman, wandering the seas for peaceful solace,"" I shouted. My words were met with a rise in her singing. I squinted through the black of night, hoping to catch a glimpse of the mysterious woman. I searched and searched, seeing nothing by black and the occasional blue reflection. I continued forward, hope still withing me.

""I see her,"" I said. ""The woman. Hello,"" I added. To my surprise, what lay in front was a woman lay floating within the water. Her eyes met mine, silence appeared, but only for a moment. She turned, swimming away. ""I mean no harm. I only wish to help you, "" I said in a desperate attempt to convince her to turn back. She continued forward, ignoring my pleas. The singing started again, though this time it was different. It sounded calm, more peaceful than before. I walked towards the tip of my vessel, leaning over, trying to reach for her. A rush of water cascaded over the boat, stealing my lamp. Panic grew, and I began searching frantically for it. It was nowhere to be seen, I grew furious. I leaped into the icy water, crazed with emotion, overwhelmed with guilt. I swam in search of the lamp, praying I would find it before freezing to death. I was surrounded by what seemed as frozen cargo. ""Could this belong to her?"" I thought. ""Is this where her vessel went down?"" I wondered. 

Ahead of me, I saw the woman now holding my lamp next to her face. She looked pale and discomforted, no surprise seeing she had been stuck stranded in the vast ocean. ""Ah, I see you've found my lamp. Come aboard with me. It is much warmer inside, "" I said, trying to sound convincing. The singing began, I could see the woman move her mouth with such elegance. ""Help me,"" she said, sounding as if she were a mere child. I swam towards her, trudging through the icy waters. As I grew closer, her face grew clearer. She was pale, with bright green eyes, her lower face stained with a crimson red, her hair a wet mess of blacks and whites. Her face being sunken showed a severe lack of nutrients. 

I grabbed what was in front of me, hoping to have her grab onto the other end. I stretched out my arm, swimming closer to her. In an instant, the light extinguished. Darkness engulfed me. I waited for my eyes to adjust, hoping to see something, anything. I tried focusing on what I had grabbed, squinting with purpose. I let out a shrill scream, my voice now being the only thing I heard. What I saw was a leg, frozen solid. It had been chewed. I could feel it. My mind panicked, my heart raced. I tried to stay as still as I possibly could, hoping that whatever did this didn't notice me. An eerie frost covered my back, a hand rested in my shoulder. I saw in the water the reflection of the woman, my lantern illuminating her every horrid detail. The last thing I remember was her extended jaw, with rows of jagged teeth.

1nq21bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/etiquette/comments/1nq21bq/ignored_and_odd_funny_looks_by_bartenderscafes/,Ignored and odd funny looks by bartenders/Cafes usually females,"ive had a few recent experiences these last few years where bartenders and occasionally where staff have been down right rude. I am short and where a hearing aid and I have a slight left ear disfigurement which I was born with.

First occasion I was waiting 20 minutes for a coffee to be served to me in a cafe and I waited ages. I felt it was odd that a few people came in after me and got served and got their drinks and food after I came in the cafe. I got impatient and asked for my money back as I felt like they had no intention of serving me. The two staff were two girls serving at the time. 

Second occasion I was going out for a meal with me family at this local pub and this barmaid upon seeing me gave me a bit of a look. Then at the bar when I went to the bar to get a drink she appeared stroppy because I asked her to repeat herself. I did say to her I do where a hearing aid. Its almost like women think I'm weird and rather I didn't exist.

When I went to Birds once I went to get a sausage cob and this lady said that they were saving the sausages left for their work colleagues. Are they even allowed to do that? I haven't been in that particular Birds shop since.

The last bit I was wrong. I was in a pub and I was having a couple of pints.  I went to the bar and this girl  gave me a funny look and said she was going to cut me off. I was apparently falling asleep. I wasn't falling asleep. I was looking on my phone and watching the tv. I was on my own at the time. I defended myself and the barmaid accused me of swearing. I wasn't swearing so I named called her in my temper and she then barred me.  After a few months I thought about going in to apologise but my heart really isn't in.  

I don't know if its my reaction to them or there reaction to me and I just got to ignore their negative reaction. I just feel like they judge me superficially a times.  It's like women have to be controversial or awkward because they think they can get away with it and have the power.  I never have this problem with men.  It Just makes me feel like not bothering going to establishments at times and just going for a walk or having as little interaction with people as possible.

# Total Estimate for Two People Kerala Luxury Tour Package

Putting it all together, for 6 nights / 7 days in a 4-star / luxury style package (double occupancy), the cost would roughly be:

**‚âà ‚Çπ20,000 to ‚Çπ40,000** for 1 Person

If you want to adjust (for example use fewer premium nights, or more modest hotels in some places), you could reduce the cost. Likewise, choosing higher end properties or private transport will increase it.

Trust me, if you‚Äôre over 50 and feeling sluggish, you‚Äôre not alone. And the good news? Small changes can lead to *big results*. I swear I‚Äôve seen it happen!

You might be thinking, ‚ÄúGreat, but what the heck can I possibly do?‚Äù It‚Äôs all about the little tweaks here and there that can add up to more pep in your step. Let me break it down:

**1. Morning Rituals Matter**  
Now listen, I get it. Mornings can be brutal. But try adding **a glass of water** first thing! üåä Your body craves hydration after sleep. Plus, it wakes up those brain cells. Win-win!

**2. Move it or Lose it**  
I‚Äôm not saying to run a marathon (unless that's your thing ‚Äì go you!). But take short walks, do gentle stretching, or even dance around the living room like nobody's watching. Seriously, it‚Äôs amazing how just **15 minutes a day** can boost your mood.

**3. Nutrition Shifts**  
Do you ever feel like you‚Äôre juggling unhealthy snacks all day? üçï Swap them for brain-boosting foods. Think nuts, berries, or even dark chocolate! I mean, who doesn‚Äôt love chocolate? Just make sure it's in moderation, ok?

**4. Mindfulness Moments**  
Take a break! Try meditating for just **five minutes** a day. Close your eyes, breathe, and visualize your energy flowing back into you. You might be surprised how refreshing it feels to just pause.

**5. Connect with Others**  
Trust me, having a chat with friends or loved ones can do wonders. Whether it's a phone call or a coffee date, socializing can recharge your batteries more than you think!

Remember, taking action can feel daunting, but even the smallest changes can make a massive difference. You don‚Äôt have to overhaul your entire life overnight‚Äîjust little bits at a time. And if you ever feel like you need extra motivation, I came across this awesome resource that emphasizes community support.

1nq1uyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1nq1uyx/need_advice_on_a_coworker_behavior/,need advice on a coworker behavior,"Hello

I need advice on something please‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt really understand the behavior of a coworker of mine, we don‚Äôt interact much because we are on the same floor but not on the same team or in the same room.

He‚Äôs been there for 6 months now and we barely spoke but everytime we did I was really nice to him and I don‚Äôt think I did something wrong that would explain his behavior.

Like 3 weeks ago I noticed that he was smiling at me when I went to ask for something. He usually smile when I talk or go to him ( which doesn‚Äôt happen much though )

But other than that, nothing‚Ä¶ he seems to speak and go easily towards everyone but me, I thought he might be totally unbothered but what had me asking is that it was my birthday 2 weeks ago and I brought some snacks and EVERYONE thanked me or wished me a HB BUT him. even those I don‚Äôt see or interact much with.
I don‚Äôt think he has forgotten but that he did it on purpose and I learned he wished a HB to any other coworkers since he‚Äôs been here.

So that left me wondering , and the day after we were all in a room for a break, taking coffee and all. I was on a corner and he came and sat next to me because there wasnt really anywhere else to sit. He sat with his back in front of me like he didn‚Äôt even want to face or see me. and of course we didn‚Äôt talk. 
When another colleague went and sat on my other side, he turned and spoke to him like I wasn‚Äôt even there‚Ä¶ 

I waited a few minutes and left, and found it a bit rude.

What do you think of this kind of behavior? 
It seems mean but I would have accepted it if the guy doesn‚Äôt like me or else, after all we are colleagues and we don‚Äôt owe anyone anything. But I don‚Äôt think I did something wrong to him that would explain that and the fact he didn‚Äôt even wish me a HB like I don‚Äôt even deserve that‚Ä¶but still he seems ¬´¬†normal¬†¬ª and even smile the few times we talked? I don‚Äôt think he has something against me..

But for the birthday thing, even a coworker I don‚Äôt really like I would at least have said something by politeness or if the person brought snacks and all‚Ä¶.so Idk‚Ä¶
What would you think of this situation?
Just a bit rude and unpolite maybe? he‚Äôs 26.

Recently, I‚Äôve developed a crush on a colleague (25F) in my grad program. She‚Äôs attractive, confident, smart ‚Äî the whole package. We message on Teams a lot, usually during work hours, and here‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening: ‚Ä¢	She sometimes/often starts the conversation herself. ‚Ä¢	We‚Äôve had coffee or lunch together, always in group settings. ‚Ä¢	She once brought me a Red Bull when I asked and wouldn‚Äôt let me pay her back. ‚Ä¢	She teases me sometimes in the group chat. ‚Ä¢	She‚Äôs asked about my girlfriend and shared details about her own breakup. ‚Ä¢	Most conversations are light ‚Äî TV, weekends, work stuff ‚Äî but personal topics pop up occasionally.

What hasn‚Äôt happened: ‚Ä¢	No messages outside work hours. ‚Ä¢	No invites to hang out alone offsite. ‚Ä¢	No romantic comments or obvious flirting. ‚Ä¢	No social media adds or texting.

The issue is me: I‚Äôve caught feelings even though nothing physical has happened. I love my girlfriend and don‚Äôt want to hurt her, but I can‚Äôt avoid this colleague entirely because of work and the dynamic of the grad community, and the constant chatting makes it harder and starting to feel she may be subtly interested too.

1nq1ns9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BillyStrings/comments/1nq1ns9/big_billy_guide_to_utrecht/,Big Billy Guide to Utrecht!,"Hey all, super pumped to see Billy and the gang here in Utrecht in a couple of weeks as I'm sure many of you are as well! As a local of the city I put together a little guide with some info for anyone curious, and of course would love to help out with any questions any one night have aside from this to help us all prep to have an amazing time! Without further adieu..


WELCOME TO UTRECHT!

Utrecht is the 4th largest city in the Netherlands, and in many ways it is the ‚Äúsecond city‚Äù after Amsterdam; Rotterdam and the Hague are bigger and more well known, but are more industrial and bureaucratic cities respectively. Utrecht is home to the largest university in the Netherlands, it is the historical capital of the country and still maintains probably the strongest social and cultural scene outside of Amsterdam. 

Tips and Tricks

Essentially everyone you meet will speak English. If you want to be polite you can say ‚ÄúMag we engels te sprechen?‚Äù which is ‚ÄúCan we speak English?‚Äù but its not a huge deal to just start in English. You can always just mention you are here visiting. 

Dutch people are generally friendly, but we have a reputation for being more direct than North American people. Just be ready for some cultural differences or interactions that dont go exactly as you expect, nothing crazy. 

Due to the geographic proximity, a lot of North American people can wrongly associate Utrecht with Amsterdam (as though it is a suburb or enclave of Ams). Don‚Äôt do this; Utrecht is it‚Äôs own city with its own culture, in a different province than Amsterdam. This is a quick way to get labeled as a ‚Äúdumb tourist‚Äù. 

Bike lanes; this is the Netherlands after all. Watch out for the bike lanes, they are everywhere. Bikes are king here; if you drive a car or walk, you yield to the bikes. Locals WILL judge you if you get in their way while they are on their ‚Äúfiets‚Äù. Also, don‚Äôt rent the tourist bikes and ride around the city unless you are a very confident urban biker, everyone will hate you.

You don‚Äôt generally need cash here to buy things, but it is accepted most places. A lot of stores have issues with Visa and Mastercard and sometimes foreign debit cards that are Visa or Mastercard. The main method of pay here is Maestro or V Pay. Just be prepared for some potential funny business with your cards, but there are ATMs (called Geldmaat) all over the city and your card should always work there if you need to take out cash.

When you take trains,trams and busses (including in Amsterdam) it is tap-in and tap-out. That means when you get on you tap your card on the reader, and right before you get off (once your stop is coming up). If you forget to tap off, you will be charged extra for a longer ride.

You can drink in public here. If you are not causing a scene, you will not be bothered at all. Beer and mixed drinks are readily available at most grocery stores. So feel free to grab a 6 pack and a pizza and take a seat by the canal to enjoy your pre-game. That would be a real Utrecht way to enjoy the evening.  

Venue

 I live very close by and have been to quite a few shows there. Tivoli Vredenburg is a very nice venue, it is actually several venues in one complex. It sits in the middle of the city, about a 10 minute walk from Centraal Station, on the Catherijnesingel. There are many bars and restaurants quite literally across the street from the venue for you to enjoy beforehand, and there is a bar with a lot of seating inside the venue on the ground floor for you to enjoy before the show. There is not really space for a ‚Äúshakedown‚Äù area, as it is right off of a very busy street with a lot of bike traffic. There are some nice steps you can sit on leading down to the canal to hang out on before or after the show however. Also just an FYI, in my experience Dutch concert goers are not going to line up early to get the best seats. So possibly no need to rush and line up 3-4 hours in advance here. 




Accommodation

Assuming at this point everyone has this sorted but just in case, Utrecht is not a city that is geared for tourism the way Amsterdam is; thus there are fewer hotel and AirBNB options, and I have heard from posters here that they are a bit pricier. My suggestion is that if at all possible, you try to stay around the Binnenstad (inner city) in Utrecht. You will be able to walk out your front door and experience the best of the city, surrounded by food and drink, and an easy walk to and from the venue. If you need to stay further out, remember that the city is extremely walkable. You are in Europe after all, a 30 minute walk here is a piece of cake ;). 

If you stay in Amsterdam it is easy to get to Utrecht Centraal and from there to the venue as well, depending where you stay in Amsterdam. The train stations in Amsterdam with the best connections to Utrecht are Amsterdam Centraal, Amsterdam Zuid, Amsterdam Amstel and Amsterdam Bijlmer ArenA. Keep in mind these are NS trains (regional) and not the local (GVB) metro you use in Amsterdam. The tickets there and back will cost you 10-15 euro each way. Factor that into your costs when you look at accommodation. 

Party Favours

  I think a big thing to get out of the way early is; marijuana is not legal in the Netherlands. This is always surprising to people because of course you can purchase it in the coffeeshops and essentially consume it in public wherever you want without fear of reprisal. All of this remains true, but it is good to be mindful of bringing goodies into the venue. Utrecht is very much not Amsterdam, perhaps not used to dealing with foreign visitors as often, and in my experience, smoking in the venue (TivoliVredenbrug) is not something that really happens. Dutch people do not smoke that much weed and often find it curious when they meet grown ups who do it a lot (they will judge you a bit for it, but you just gotta tell them its a cultural difference). 

This applies for getting belligerent in public. Police can stop you, and confiscate your herb. If you have more than 5 grams on you it is technically illegal and they can issue you a fine. In practice they will not do this if you are a calm, normal person; but I am thinking for post-show enjoyers who may go a little too far (and more power to you!); be mindful of the legal situation here. 

Aside from that, if you are a connoisseur of the plant, Amsterdam has the better coffee shops (if strains, genetics, etc are important). Otherwise there are a few solid places in Utrecht that can fix you up. The Culture Boat is a must experience for enjoyers, it is an old steamboat on the canal and the only coffeeshop in the city that allows for sit-down consumption. 

DO NOT BUY ANY CANNABIS PRODUCTS FROM ANYWHERE OTHER THAN A COFFEESHOP, THOSE ARE ALL SCAMS. ALL OF THEM.

Coffeeshops dont sell truffles (shrooms); those are purchased from things called ‚Äúsmart shops‚Äù. You will find many variety of truffles with info on potency / dosage etc., Truffles are the exact same thing as shrooms, but you take a bigger dose to achieve the same effects. You can find dosing guides easily on the net. They are the same as zooms, expect the same experience. 


Again, if there are any questions you have about Utrecht or the Netherlands that I haven't covered, let me know and I'll try to help out! So pumped to see everybody in a few weeks!",7,1758790448.0,BillyStrings,1,0.89,False

You know, clqssic single-girl evening affair. I matched with this guy who seemed pretty normal, which is a rarity thsee days, lol. We chatted a bit, and he seemd geuninely funny and interesting. So, when he suggested meeting up at this coffee shop he loves, I thought, why not?

Fast fowrard to our date day. I show up, expecting a chill coffee date. But oh boy, was I in for a surprise. As I walk in, I see him standing near the entrance, holding this maassive bouquet of... wait for it... balloons! üò≥ I mean, there had to be at least 20 of them, all in different shapes and colors. It felt like I was stepping into a New Year's Eve pqrty.

Now, I get it, romantic gestures can be sweet and all. But carryjng a literal cloud of balloons around town? üòÇ I ckuldn't help but laugh, and tbh, he lloked slightly embarrassed but was laughing too. He explained that he found the idea 'quirky' and 'fun,' which I guess was true... but just not super practical.

We ended up ditchhing the balloons at the shop ‚Äî leaving the staff with quite the colorful decor change ‚Äî and had a good laugh over coffee about the whole situation. Honestly, it was a graet icebreaker, and we managed to just have fun and be ourselves. Despite the initial hiccup, the date was kinda endearing, and who knows, maybe there's a second one on the horizon... sans balloons, hopefully! üòÇ",9,1758790418.0,OnlineDatingStory,1,1.0,False

1nq1nc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1nq1nc8/alignment_keeps_going_off_on_2013_toyota_tacoma/,Alignment keeps going off on 2013 Toyota Tacoma,"Hey everyone, ive got a 2013 Toyota Tacoma and in the last two years I‚Äôve had a lot of work done to it, control arms, tie rods, struts, wheel bearings, rack, lower steering column, and maybe a few other things, I‚Äôd have to go over my invoices but the majority of the front end is 2 years old or less. The rack is the newest item I had put on, the old one failed. After installation everything was great for about 2 or 3 weeks then my alignment went off, called the shop and they couldn‚Äôt get me in that day so I went to another that was recommended to me by a coworker and they lined it up, about 1 week later alignment was off again. I drive a lot for work and was out of town and getting worried it‚Äôs something major I went to another shop, they got it lined up, noted that everything looked tight and nothing looked like an issue. Drove off the property, got on the highway and my steering wheel was hanging about a quarter turn to the right when driving straight as soon as I got on the highway. Turned around and they took it on the highway and confirmed and then redid the alignment, it was better but still not 100%. Within that week it was back off.

Anyways this week I was back home working and able to get it to the shop that did the rack, explained to them everything going on, mentioned maybe it could be something with the rack installation or maybe it‚Äôs faulty in someway cause I never had this issue before that. They did the alignment, checked it over and noted that everything is tight and good and should be no problems. I jokingly told them I‚Äôd see them tomorrow and they laughed and said hopefully not. Sure enough next day I got coffee in the morning and when I left the parking lot steering wheel was hanging to the right about a quarter turn again. Went back yesterday and they went over everything again including the back end and found no issues and are just perplexed. I haven‚Äôt drove it yet this morning, I left the shop yesterday with it and it is good but I fully expect it will be off by end of the week if not today.  

Has anyone experienced this? My next option is take it to a Toyota dealership but I‚Äôve now had 5 or 6 alignments and 3 different mechanics tell me they can‚Äôt see what the issue is. I‚Äôm curious if this is a Tacoma specific issue, or what the hell is going on.",1,1758790397.0,MechanicAdvice,1,1.0,False

This is my second post on here, previously I met some amazing people but unfortunately a good friend of mine had to return home and I feel like I lost someone who was going to be a very good friend here. 

Hopefully I am able to meet likeminded individuals that are kind and have a great vibe about them.

I am originally Arab and recently moved from London. I have just turned 30 and enjoy music (Got my Weeknd tickets for London august which I am excited about). Sports (Chelsea and an Al ittihad fan, would love to meet someone who I can go to games with regularly). Into UFC/ Boxing too. Into tech and shopping (My clothes back home couldn't all fit in my bag aha) 

Enjoy eating out and coffee which is a blessing here as there are so many options. 

Please dont hesitate to reach out and dm me. I really want to connect and develop a very good friendship group and be able to plan lots of cool activities together. 

Looking forward to hearing from you all.

1nq1k77,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nq1k77/there_is_someone_claiming_to_be_my_dead_uncle_pt1/,There is someone claiming to be my dead uncle (Pt.1),"I come from a long, old family line, but most of it feels like a blur. When I was four, my mother left for a life wrapped up in drugs. I barely remember her face. Since then, it‚Äôs only ever been me and my dad. We left Brooklyn years ago and moved to a small desert town in Southern California called Shadow Ridge. He works in housing development, usually stumbling home at midnight, reeking of aftershave and stress. 


That‚Äôs when I got a strange notification on Instagram one night, I froze. The account had no profile picture. No posts. Just a single line. ‚ÄúHello Maribel, my name is Cody and I believe you are my niece?‚Äù. I read it about 6 times. Each time, goosebumps rose on both my arms. I wrote back: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but I think you have the wrong Maribel, I don‚Äôt have an Uncle Cody‚Äù. No reply that night. When I woke up the next morning, my phone lit up with notifications. All I saw nothing but notifications from YouTube videos, my emails from University, and Instagram. When I checked my Instagram account, I got a new message from the same blank account, but this time they had sent a picture. 

It was of me. Of when I was about 2 months old. In the picture, holding me was a man, long brown hair that looked like the end of dusty old broom, his frame gaunt, starved. His eyes were worse than the rest: wide, sleepless, almost feverish. Beneath the picture. It said ‚ÄúThis was you when you were about four months old‚Äù, I stared at the picture until my eyes burned. My hands shook so badly I almost dropped my phone. Then came another message. ‚ÄúI remember the day you were born, the day you first walked, and the way you wore that pink princess dress until you were five.‚Äù Tears blurred my vision. I did own a pink princess dress. I wore it until the fabric tore at the seems. I thought only my dad remembered that. 

I typed back with trembling fingers. ‚ÄúI barely remember any of that. How do I even know that you are who you say you are?‚Äù Almost immediately, another ding. ‚ÄúI understand your concern. But your father and I had a falling out about eighteen years ago. We lost contact after that.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt reply. I couldn‚Äôt. My mind spun with questions I couldn‚Äôt answer. Who was this person? How did they get that picture? How did they know my childhood? Sleep came hard, but exhaustion eventually dragged me under. 

The next morning, I caught my dad as he was heading out for work. He wore his company uniform, hair slicked back with too much gel, the sharp sting of aftershave following him. He looked tired, but not surprised when I asked the question that had been drilling into my head all night. ‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I said carefully, ‚Äúdo you‚Ä¶. Have a brother? Or an uncle? Someone named Cody?‚Äù The change in his face was instant. His brow dropped like a storm cloud, his polite half smile folding into a grimace. His voice came out low, sharp, like he was choking back rage.  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt. And I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd ask me that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶.. I was just curious, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù My voice broke into a whimper. Before I could say anything else, he slammed the door behind him, climbed into his pickup, and roared down the street. 

I stood frozen, then collapsed onto the couch, hot tears burning down my cheeks. My dad had never spoken to me like that. Never. Why would a simple question about family make him so furious? I tried to distract myself with the TV, flipping through channels, but every noise felt wrong. The house was too quiet. Too heavy. At some point I fell into a long, restless sleep, ten hours swallowed whole. 

When I woke, it was to my dad nudging my foot. His face looked pale, set. He carried an old cardboard box, edges frayed, dust clinging to the lid. He dropped it on the coffee table with a thud that rattled through me. Without a word, he opened it. Inside were stacks of photos yellowed edges, curled corners. He shuffled through them until he stopped at one. He slid it across the table. It was the same photo. Me as a baby. The same man holding me. Only this time, his face had been violently scratched out with something sharp. I forced the words out ‚ÄúWho was holding me?‚ÄùMy dad‚Äôs jaw clenched. His voice dropped to a whisper. ‚ÄúIt was your Uncle Cody. He died when you were five.‚Äù",3,1758790053.0,nosleep,1,0.81,False

1nq1je1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nq1je1,Ranking the taste of their breast milk as someone who has sucked on all of their titties,"The warmest and best tasting would probably have to go to Nanami, sadly he just didn't have much to give. He had mentioned that he fed a few people before me so I only got crumbs. 

Toji comes second, his big tits had the perfect flow of essence into my awaiting mouth. It's not too watery and not too thick. It had a very subtle sweetness to it. The only reason Toji is at 2 is he degraded me while I was drinking which I don't love. 

Next is Yaga. You'd think at his age his supply would have dried up but it didn't! When I sucked on his nipples I got a very subtle coffee bean scent on him which reminded me of drinking a warm coffee in the morning. Also he was very easy to cuddle. He was a bit weary of me sucking the milk out of his tits at first but he got used to it.

4th goes to Geto. Our time together was quite short. Perhaps it is all of the curses he absorbed, but his breast milk was a bit foul tasting. He seemed to get a lot of pleasure from it though which was nice. At the end he called me a good girl and licked the milk off my lips, what a nice guy! Bad taste but wonderful hospitality.

In second to last is Gojo. To me, Gojo's milk was a bit cold. It was quite thin, like a lactaid type of milk. While I was drinking he was squirming talking about Geto, they must've done this challenge too. 

And finally, Sukuna. Sukuna's breast milk came out as like a black-ish color. I could taste bitterness on it. You'd be surprised but a lot of emotions are carried through breast milk. He definitely had some time to prepare because his tits were nice and juicy. Again, he degraded me which I didn't like. ",14,1758789961.0,LobotomyKaisen,22,0.9,False

I was told that I could not use ECMS express to ship the manga book that I had bought to Malaysia, because ECMS is unable to ship books? I'm just curious where to find that information from.

The book that I had bought is a school comedy manga, and is quite definitely neither a magazine, nor pornographic. I've also never had any issues with buying manga online from Japan, so I don't think this is an issue with Malaysia.

Coffee doesn't taste great compared to other options like hot chocolate or other tasty hot beverages. You drink coffee because of the caffiene not because of the taste. Same with non-alcoholic beer. What's the point. Beer doesn't taste great compared to other options like soda, juice, seltzer water, etc. You drink beer because you're trying to get a buzz not because of the taste.

1nq1i7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nq1i7r/there_is_someone_claiming_to_be_my_dead_uncle_pt1/,There is someone claiming to be my dead uncle (Pt.1),"I come from a long, old family line, but most of it feels like a blur. When I was four, my mother left for a life wrapped up in drugs. I barely remember her face. Since then, it‚Äôs only ever been me and my dad. We left Brooklyn years ago and moved to a small desert town in Southern California called Shadow Ridge. He works in housing development, usually stumbling home at midnight, reeking of aftershave and stress. 

That‚Äôs when I got a strange notification on Instagram one night, I froze. The account had no profile picture. No posts. Just a single line. ‚ÄúHello Maribel, my name is Cody and I believe you are my niece?‚Äù. 

I read it about 6 times. Each time, goosebumps rose on both my arms. I wrote back: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but I think you have the wrong Maribel, I don‚Äôt have an Uncle Cody‚Äù. No reply that night. When I woke up the next morning, my phone lit up with notifications. All I saw nothing but notifications from YouTube videos, my emails from University, and Instagram. When I checked my Instagram account, I got a new message from the same blank account, but this time they had sent a picture. It was of me. Of when I was about 2 months old. In the picture, holding me was a man, long brown hair that looked like the end of dusty old broom, his frame gaunt, starved. His eyes were worse than the rest: wide, sleepless, almost feverish. Beneath the picture. It said ‚ÄúThis was you when you were about four months old‚Äù, I stared at the picture until my eyes burned. 

My hands shook so badly I almost dropped my phone. Then came another message. ‚ÄúI remember the day you were born, the day you first walked, and the way you wore that pink princess dress until you were five.‚Äù Tears blurred my vision. I did own a pink princess dress. I wore it until the fabric tore at the seems. I thought only my dad remembered that. I typed back with trembling fingers. ‚ÄúI barely remember any of that. How do I even know that you are who you say you are?‚Äù Almost immediately, another ding. ‚ÄúI understand your concern. But your father and I had a falling out about eighteen years ago. We lost contact after that.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt reply. I couldn‚Äôt. My mind spun with questions I couldn‚Äôt answer. 

Who was this person? How did they get that picture? How did they know my childhood? Sleep came hard, but exhaustion eventually dragged me under. 

The next morning, I caught my dad as he was heading out for work. He wore his company uniform, hair slicked back with too much gel, the sharp sting of aftershave following him. He looked tired, but not surprised when I asked the question that had been drilling into my head all night. ‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I said carefully, ‚Äúdo you‚Ä¶. Have a brother? Or an uncle? Someone named Cody?‚Äù The change in his face was instant. His brow dropped like a storm cloud, his polite half smile folding into a grimace. His voice came out low, sharp, like he was choking back rage.  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt. And I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd ask me that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶.. I was just curious, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù My voice broke into a whimper. Before I could say anything else, he slammed the door behind him, climbed into his pickup, and roared down the street. 

I stood frozen, then collapsed onto the couch, hot tears burning down my cheeks. My dad had never spoken to me like that. Never. Why would a simple question about family make him so furious? I tried to distract myself with the TV, flipping through channels, but every noise felt wrong. The house was too quiet. Too heavy. At some point I fell into a long, restless sleep, ten hours swallowed whole. 

When I woke, it was to my dad nudging my foot. His face looked pale, set. He carried an old cardboard box, edges frayed, dust clinging to the lid. He dropped it on the coffee table with a thud that rattled through me. Without a word, he opened it. Inside were stacks of photos yellowed edges, curled corners. He shuffled through them until he stopped at one. He slid it across the table. It was the same photo. 

Me as a baby. The same man holding me. Only this time, his face had been violently scratched out with something sharp. I forced the words out ‚ÄúWho was holding me?‚ÄùMy dad‚Äôs jaw clenched. His voice dropped to a whisper. ‚ÄúIt was your Uncle Cody. He died when you were five.‚Äù",2,1758789836.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs not that you don‚Äôt want to spend time with people, it‚Äôs that every social decision comes with a mental calculation, sometimes you end up saying no so often that it looks like you‚Äôre pulling away when in reality you‚Äôre just trying to keep your bank account from going negative.

It can also affect relationships in deeper ways dating, for example becomes stressful when you feel like you have nothing to offer financially, even if you have plenty to offer emotionally. In long term relationships, money stress can create tension, resentment or guilt especially if one person is carrying more of the financial weight. Even friendships can get strained because you might feel embarrassed admitting you can‚Äôt afford what everyone else is doing or you worry about being judged if you‚Äôre always the one opting out.

What‚Äôs tough is that money stress doesn‚Äôt just drain your wallet, it drains your energy and self esteem too, it can make you feel like you‚Äôre always on the outside looking in even with people who love and care about you.

1nq1ff1,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1nq1ff1/2week_korea_itinerary/,2-week Korea itinerary,"Hi everyone, we‚Äôve just come back from our trip to Korea, and I wanted to share our itinerary as inspiration for anyone planning to go. It included a mix of cultural, historical, and natural sites, so there was really something for everyone. And we also added some picturesque cafes we found on Instagram.

One highlight was the tea farm experience, though note that it‚Äôs only available from April to September. We used AI tools to draft the initial plan (for macro-level planning), which was helpful, but some of the recommendations were a bit off.

There were four of us travelling, and the total cost for car rental, fuel, accommodation, and food came to around ‚Ç¨1,000 per person. We stayed in good hotels and ate really well, so it was definitely worth it. Having a friend who speaks Korean made a big difference.

A couple of practical tips: most European cards don‚Äôt work in Korea, so it‚Äôs best to have cash. We also found that the best exchange rates were actually at the airport, which surprised us!

**About the Role:**
This is a general posting for multiple Sr. Machine Learning roles open across our 4-sided marketplace. You‚Äôll get the chance to learn about the problems the different ML teams solve as you go through the process. Towards the end of your process, we‚Äôll do a team-matching exercise to determine which of the open roles/teams you‚Äôll join. You can find a blurb on each team at the bottom of this page. 
**About the Team:**
The Search & Recommendations ML team sits at the forefront of Instacart‚Äôs push to unify search, discovery, merchandising, and recommendations under a single, reasoning-rich AI platform. Working shoulder-to-shoulder with world-class engineers, data scientists, and product managers, we build the LLM backbone that will power every pixel of the shopping journey.

**What we‚Äôre building:**
  * **Models for Search and Recommendations** ‚Äì We‚Äôre consolidating over 80 task-specific models into a small set of large, general-purpose LLMs and multi-task models that reason holistically across user intent understanding, ranking, ads, and merchandising.

Our commitment to AI innovation is reflected in our recent publications and research contributions to the field (Recent publications 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). 
**About the Job:**
  * Architect and scale foundational LLM systems that unify query understanding, personalization, ranking, ads, and merchandising‚Äîreplacing dozens of siloed models with a single, adaptive backbone.

1nq19rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nq19rb/which_coffee_grinder_should_i_choose_for_daily_use/,Which coffee grinder should I choose for daily use?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! After spending countless hours researching and testing different coffee grinders, I thought I'd share my experience to help others who might be in the same boat. Trust me, I've been through the struggle of choosing the perfect coffee grinder for daily use.

First things first - if you're serious about your coffee game, you absolutely need a good coffee grinder. Pre-ground coffee just doesn't cut it. The flavor difference between freshly ground beans and pre-ground is like night and day.

I recently discovered this awesome deal on a fantastic coffee grinder that I've been using for the past few months: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. It's been a game-changer for my morning routine.

Now, let's talk about what really matters when choosing a grinder:

Burr vs. Blade Grinders:
Burr grinders are definitely the way to go. They give you consistent grounds, which is crucial for even extraction. Blade grinders are cheaper but they chop beans unevenly, leading to bitter or weak coffee.

Grind Settings:
You'll want multiple grind settings. Fine for espresso, medium for drip coffee, and coarse for French press. The more settings, the better control you have over your brew.

Noise Level:
This is something people often overlook. Some grinders sound like a jet engine taking off - not ideal for early mornings when everyone's still sleeping!

Capacity:
Consider how much coffee you make daily. If you're brewing for a family or office, you'll want something bigger. For single users, a smaller capacity works fine.

Durability:
Ceramic burrs last longer than steel ones, but they're more expensive. Steel burrs are great for daily use and more budget-friendly.

After trying several options, I settled on this particular model (https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) because it hits all these points perfectly. It's got 40 grind settings, operates quietly, and the build quality is impressive.

Quick maintenance tips:
- Clean your grinder weekly
- Use a brush to remove old grounds
- Run some cheap rice through it monthly to remove oils
- Check burr alignment every few months

One thing I've learned is that investing in a quality grinder actually saves money in the long run. You'll get better flavor from cheaper beans when they're ground properly, compared to expensive pre-ground coffee.

The whole ""buy cheap, buy twice"" saying really applies here. I started with a $20 blade grinder and ended up upgrading within months. Should've just gotten a good one from the start!

Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to help fellow coffee lovers make informed decisions about their coffee gear!",1,1758788877.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
