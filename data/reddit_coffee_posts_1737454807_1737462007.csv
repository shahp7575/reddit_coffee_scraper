We had plans to live together and build a house, start a podcast, own a coffee shop, and do a bunch of other things together. 
She got a boyfriend a few months ago. I didn’t think it’d be a big deal.  But now we can’t live together or build a house. She hasn’t even brought it up to him. Her boyfriend wants to buy a house eventually and wants to live with friends. But she won’t even bring up living with me. We’ve been talking about starting a podcast long before meeting him, but because he brought it up first she doesn’t want to start ours until he does. 
I feel like I’m being replaced. Or that she doesn’t need me anymore. I recently moved in with her and her family. But in a couple months she’ll be moving in with her boyfriend and I obviously can’t stay here. I’ve been thinking about going back sooner, but I feel like if I do we’re gonna drift apart. 
I don’t know if my feelings are valid or not. Probably not. How should I handle this? What should I do?",1,1737461499.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Is it better to ask straight up in the message or email is any positions are available, or is it better to try and get an informational interview over a coffee chat and then enquire about potential unpaid internship positions at said firm. I would try both, but the caveat is that the city im current living in is quite limited in terms of its boutique selection so I'd like to get some insight around the ideal way of going about it.

1i6h57v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1i6h57v/visited_some_places_that_were_recommended_here/,Visited some places that were recommended here,"I am now a Paris resident but I still read and contribute to this forum for entertainment and also to give back for the advice I have received in the past. Recently my wife and I started visiting new places after dropping the kids to school and I wanted to report back on the most recent three.

  
1. L'Eclair de Genie €28

Modern looking space with exposed brick and other touches. Friendly staff that spoke english when they heard my horrid French. 

Coffee (2 cappuccinos) was flat, lacked any complexity, tasted like they were made with substandard beans - we both drank without sugar. 

We purchased a salted caramel eclair and a paris brest eclair. The salted caramel was the star but both of the eclairs were cold, not fresh and lackluster. In my opinion the pastry of the eclair should have a crunch, and the cream should be fresh - not overly thick and cold.  Overall I would not say this place was worth the 2x premium over any other patisserie. 

2. Brigat €23

Another modern-looking place, blue and white, with 3 butcher block tables at the back, charges higher prices for items consumed on site (sur place). 

We ordered a croissant, a tarte citron, and a piece of vanilla flan. Our coffees were double espresso and cappuccino. The croissant was good but nothing special; the tarte citron was great, on top was some zest of candied lemon which was nice. I would call it exceptional if not for the overly hard crust that seemed to be shared by all of their pastries. The flan was interesting, with much fewer (maybe none) egg yolks than your standard flan, almost a pudding-like consistency. It was obviously made with real vanilla and had a good flavor. The flan also had an overly hard crust, which made it not enjoyable to eat, particularly in contrast with the extremely soft filling. On the way out, I purchased a traditional baguette, which was the standard price (1.30) and very good. Overall I would not go back to pay 2.5x the standard price for pastries that were 10-20% better than the place you just walked by. The baguette, however, was good, and when I am in that area (for example, at Bastille Market), I will grab one, but it is not worth more than a couple-minute diversion. 

3. Carette €44

I should have bailed when I saw the line of tourists out front but some good places have lines too (kodawari ramen for one) so I stuck with it. I was also waiting for Musee de l'Homme to open so no time lost. 

The interior was classic, pink marble tables and packed tight as is the Paris standard. Gilt glass, tile floors rounded out the classic look. 

We ordered a Chocolat Carette, Cafe filtre, croissant, chocolate eclair, and Paris Carette (Paris breast in eclair form). As with L'Eclair de Genie, the chocolate eclair was refrigerated and served cold, which takes off 2-3 points immediately. The flavor was OK, but as with the last cold eclair, the pastry part was soft. The Paris Carette which was room temp - was very good, although you had to bite it sideways to keep from smushing out all the cream. Eating it with a fork and knife presented its own challenges. The cream was light and had a good mocha flavor, the pastry had a nice crunchy coating. The croissant was good, not exceptional but good, by local boulangerie (Académie Du Pain) is better, and 1/3 the price. The chocolate Carette was different somehow, although I couldn't figure out how; it was chocolaty and creamy, and the chantilly was also good, but not exceptional. The cafe filtre was flat, not worth mentioning. Overall, it's not worth the price or the wait; I would say things are 3x your standard here. The breakfast menu with eggs, a side of salmon or avocado, croissant, and juice was €38...

  
In conclusion, the trendy spots are not worth the money!",0,1737461292.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,0.5,False

1i6h36e,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1i6h36e/curious_anyone_taking_lithium_orotate_how_do_you/,"Curious anyone taking lithium orotate how do you feel on it? I feel like it's completely capped my arousal, like, I just don't get very excited and that's probably a good thing.","Been taking 15mg lithium orotate a day for two weeks now. It feels like it's putting a limit on how excited/energized I can get.

For example I normally don't drink coffee because caffeine sends me into hypomania every-time. Racing thoughts, extreme energy, difficulty sleeping. However I drank some caffeine yesterday and had none of those effects, I just noticed I was a bit more talkative and felt less tired but otherwise didn't feel hypomanic at all. 

Today I had a hard Muay Thai training session. Usually after these hard sessions I'll feel a bit hypomanic, very full of energy, mind racing, difficulty sleeping. Again I feel like the lithium is capping my upside. I feel good right now, but not manic. 

Just curious if this has been other people's experience using lithium orotate. I think ultimately it's really good and I need to re-calibrate what ""good"" and ""energized"" feel like for me as I have associated hypomania too often with feeling 100%. I'm hopeful that this capping of my energy will mean I won't slide into despair and depression.",1,1737461078.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

The idea allows for visitors to your site (let's call them supporters!) to thank you with donations.

In return they get to post a message to your site for X days and link back to their site. The message would be displayed as a site banner, or maybe it's more like a regular ad spot - I'm still thinking about it.

Sponsorble provides the tools for the site owner to feature the ads and take direct payment via Stripe. The site owner just needs to add a javascript link to enable the display (similar to adsense) or activate a WP plugin.

Because it's a direct relationship between supporter and site, privacy is retained - there's no cookie being set or data-mining shenanigans. So no cookie banner needs to be displayed.

So, in summary:

It's like Buy Me a Coffee, but your supporters get a chance to show a message on your website in a banner, ad or some other way (tbc!)

It's like Adsense, but without all the tracking cookies, data sharing etc.

Anyway, it's an early stage idea but would appreciate any thoughts!

We all know grad school isn't just about academics - it's a marathon of deadlines, research, and endless cups of coffee. Sometimes it feels like we're all just barely keeping our heads above water, but I know this community is packed with wisdom and experience.   
  
What are some of your best tips for getting through the grind? Here are a few areas I'd love advice on:    
  
1. **Time Management:** How do you balance research, classes, and everything else?  
  
2. **Mental Health:** What helps you stay sane when stress levels skyrocket?  
  
3. **Productivity Hacks:** Any study techniques or tools that have been game-changers?  
  
4. **Social Life:** How do you all maintain relationships and avoid total isolation?

Let's share what works, what doesn't, and what's helped you survive (or even thrive) in this crazy grad school journey. Whether it's routines, resources, or just some good old-fashioned motivation, I'm all ears. Let's help each other make it to the finish line!

It kinda sucks. I don't think the grind is anywhere near fine enough to make espresso with it. I have a delonghi stilosa ec235.bk from which I have taken out the pressurized basket bits. 

I guess all I'm really asking is if I should just chuck this thing out in favour of an aliexpress manual grinder or if there is some other way of making it work...

I had in the last 1 or 1.5 years very frequently respiratory infections. On average every 1.5 month, I would say. Sometimes I'm just coming out of an infection and a few days later I'm coughing again.   
  
Last year I had an episode, in which the sore throat did not stop for around 3 weeks. Then I went to the doctor, he did a blood test, did not find any sign of a specific virus (Epstein-Barr) and said that I should just wait. Eventually it ended.   
Over the New Year this year, I had an atypical-pneumonia, which originally started as some sort of upper-respiratory infection. I'm still not entirely over it, because my nose is still somewhat runny, but yesterday I started coughing again. I'm also starting to feel the usual ""illness""-feeling and my throat is starting to hurt.   
  
Next to these symptoms, I have had diarrhea on and off for around 10 years, out of the 10 years, I kept a gluten-free diet for 6, when it was quite alright for a few years but when I started to have diarrhea again, I eventually stopped the diet (I only had a genetic test before to verify that I could have gluten and lactose intolerance, I got these tests prescribed from the dermatologist, as I went to her with a serious eczema on my hands). Since I'm working in an office full-time (almost 3 years), sometimes I have to go to poop around 7 to 10 times a day. I lately reduced coffee consume, especially in the morning, but it still occurs. I also exercise very infrequently, because of this goddamn office work (but working on this to become better). My diet is ok, but probably I could eat some more fruits and veggies. I'm also working on this in this new year.

Could this be some kind of immunodeficiency? I got a negative test result for Celiac disease as eventually, after restarting with gluten I went for a blood test and to get down on my gastrointestinal problems (the diagnosis was, if no celiac disease, then I might just be too stressed...). I also have to say, that before highly stressful situations, I have diarrhea and stomach pain, so usually I have to run to the toilet which is super annoying.

What should I do, to what kind of doctor should I go and for what check-ups (Unfortunately I'm in a system here, where you do not have a specific GP; so no one really knows everything about me)? I'm really getting tired of falling sick constantly, even though I started taking A, C, E and D vitamins and probiotics after the pneumonia. ",1,1737460146.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I know this may sound laughable, but sometimes being richer than God is challenging. Emotionally, I mean.

Being incalculably wealthy since the day you were born can make life…flavorless. I’ve indulged in every imaginable depravity. I’ve ingested the cutting edge in mood-altering alchemy. I want for nothing.

And yet, I’m unhappy. Or maybe unhappy isn’t the right word - I’m indifferently indifferent. Hollow is pretty close, but isn’t exactly it.

It’s difficult to have never known hunger. I’ve tried to feed myself a great many things, but, apparently, I have no appetite for reality.

Until this most recent experiment.

I figured - some poor people seem happy. Maybe pretending to live like them will awaken some dormant hunger within myself.

After two weeks, I was ready to call the experiment a wash. But then there was this moment. I was at a local coffee shop, and I felt a smoldering warmth inside my chest. The sensation was so foreign that I genuinely believed I spilled coffee on my suit at first.

I watched the barista cheerily hand another patron their drink. A custodian walked by me who had a very peculiar melancholy about him. The temperature in the shop was crisp but not sweltering.

The experience was perfect. Transcendent, even. A quiet, beautiful comfort. Like I was inside an oil painting.

But when that warmth dissipated, I wanted more.

So, I bought the coffee shop. Bought every business on that street, actually - for privacy's sake. Filled the shop with paid actors, provided them direction and a script in order to recreate the moment. But it wasn’t the same.

An easy fix, I thought.

Local cops on my payroll pulled CC-TV footage from that day, which allowed me to determine exactly who was in the shop when I was.

I hired those exact people to come back to the coffee shop - my assistant told them it was for a “documentary”. At the rates I was paying, though, I could have told them they were coming to watch me castrate myself. No one would have batted an eye.

My assistant did neglect to mention they would be there for as long as I wanted them to be.

Three months later, something still wasn’t right. I couldn’t put my finger on it.

Maybe skinning the custodian’s family alive was *too* upsetting. I didn’t make him watch, though, I just told him that it happened, figuring that may be a happy middle-ground to reinvigorate his peculiar melancholy without breaking his mind.

I’ve had to re-cast the custodian, unfortunately.

Today, however, it finally hit me. It wasn’t the custodian’s demeanor after all. It was the way the barista looked - she was slightly off from how I remembered her.

Since that perfect day, the woman had undergone a nose job. That’s what was off.

I waved Gregor over, who will be assisting in reverting that change.

A hollow smile slinked across my face.

Soon - I would be warm and full again.",2,1737459878.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1i6gowl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1i6gowl/i_feel_like_im_in_an_episode_of_the_twilight_zone/,I feel like I’m in an episode of The Twilight Zone,"I reconnected with my best friend a few years ago and we are both married now. I had a hard time getting to know her (again) and her husband because we just bonded over video games so my hubby and I decided to meet them in person to hang out. When we met with them in person, they couldn’t look at us in the eye. They only spoke to each other and looked at each other and we tried talking with them and being friendly but they held hands and hugged one another. During the movie, they turned their bodies away from us and towards each other and they went on Snapchat and they were writing something on their phone. My friend fell asleep after 20 minutes that the movie started playing and I felt so awkward and honestly felt it was kind of rude. After the movie was finished, she expressed herself and said, “That was such a great movie!!!!” 

We brushed it off but kept realizing that they keep falling asleep. They invited us to their house and we were watching an episode of a show and my friend grabbed a blanket, started cuddling with her husband and fell asleep right away. 

Another time, we went to a Renaissance Festival and on our way back home, her husband fell asleep while my husband was trying to talk to him about a live show they had watched. They looked like two amish kids at the festival, everything scared them except the live shows. They didn’t like people talking to them; whereas my husband and I chatted with a few strangers at the festival which we thought were cool.

I tried inviting my friend to a coffee/shopping date just her and I and she will only go if I pick her up. So I did a few times, but every time I do, she’s very quiet, she can’t look at me, and she’s always on her apple watch or her phone. Once she warms up to me, she can have good conversation but while I’m talking she will be looking at messages on her apple watch. I confronted her about this and she didn’t understand what was so bad about checking her phone and texting people back. I thought everyone had common sense when it came to technology etiquette when you’re hanging out in person with someone or middle of a conversation.

She then confessed to me that she has too much social anxiety and only wants to hang out with me if her husband is there but that she doesn’t feel comfortable leaving the house without her husband and she’s always holding onto him and he doesn’t speak in front of me he only talks to my husband in person but her husband always talks to me if we are on face time or discord. This friendship is very confusing.

Then my husband I went to church and we tried making friends there but the two families we really liked who are way older than us (late 30’s and 40’s) say that they have too much social anxiety to invite us to their house. The wife said that she can’t do one on ones with people because she feels so anxious and the other couple always say that they can’t do anything with us when we invite them anywhere because they go to sleep at 8pm every night. In reality they just doom-scroll or watch tv in their bedroom and work and they say that they’re very exhausted. 

Another woman from our church invited me to a small last minute hang out at her place after she put her kiddos to sleep so I went. I took some chips and she had prepared some salsa and drinks. A whole group of people came to the hang out (around 10 women from church), and everyone brought a dish, charcuterie boards, etc. Tell me why everyone was too embarrassed to get any food. The host felt weird and bad that she was the only one serving herself food, so I dug in and started snacking and talking with people but people didn’t want to serve themselves. They were too embarrassed it was weird. They looked and sounded awkward. They sat down and one of the ladies said she was leaving already (after a rough hour of being there) because she goes to sleep at 8pm and she goes to sleep early but in reality she just wanted to doom-scroll on her phone. After she left, the rest of the ladies were still empty handed and they had a hard time conversating. If I said anything, they would interrupt me and take over just to share their short thought and then there would be an awkward silence. I noticed that the woman next to me was on amazon looking at furniture and she was replying to a text message. I read the whole thing and it was something that wasn’t even important and I felt it was unnecessary. I left right after. 

Tried joining a few clubs, but I’m seeing a trend that most people will pay to join a club/hobby/activity but not go. They’ll go once and get tired of it so these things are never consistent. I feel like I’m living in the wrong generation/culture/country. Wtf.

I live quite a minimalist lifestyle and so does my roommate with the exception of her ever growing plant collection that is taking up valuable space in the living room, kitchen, bathroom and terrace. If there is a square inch of space that isn’t taken up by and appliance or a person, there is a goddamn plant. 

Quite frankly I’m beginning to lose my shit every time she brings a new one into the apartment. It seems like I’m overreacting but she has a plant that I have to move every time I flush the toilet and there’s plants in the shower and sink all the time because they are on some kind of watering schedule?? They’re on the coffee table, the dining table, on the floor in the entrance!!! The only place they aren’t is my room.

And she is such a sweet person normally but this seems to be the issue that she wants to be a bitch about.

Ive  spoken to her about this but she keeps brushing me off saying it’s not the worst thing in the world to have some plants. And no matter what I say I can’t get through to her about how it’s negatively effecting me as it’s frustrating to have my space so cramped with plants, which makes me only able to really enjoy my bedroom. But seeing as we pay equal rent it doesn’t seem fair that she can monopolise the living areas. 

I’ve even talked to the landlord who won’t help saying that it’s an issue between us.

But I don’t want to give up the apartment as it’s considered cheap where I live and super local and convenient. 

How do I deal with this brick wall of a plant mom??? ",2,1737459329.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I understand how it may not be a viable option for everyone because the taste can be triggering, but it’s thankfully worked for me. The other good news is that I’m not chugging them, which is about one or two cans every two days I drink them, which means my relationship with it is healthy. It helps that it’s stupid expensive too so that I’m not spending money out the ass every two days. I only drink NA beer anytime I get a strong itch. If it’s a mild itch I just go for coffee, which I’m trying to have a healthier relationship with caffeine as well because my sleep is fuuuucked. 

It’s a tough road, but I’m five weeks as of yesterday so can’t complain.

Ps I will however say that there is some guilt associated with drinking non alcoholic beer sometimes, like “I shouldn’t be tasting this right now,” which I think is what leads people back down the primrose path of drinking again, to which I respond you shouldn’t feel guilty, you’re just doing whatever means necessary to keep yourself sober.",3,1737459174.0,cutdowndrinking,2,1.0,False

I have had a bad mental health week. My kids and self were sick again 😭 my son’s already bad sleep was on a whole new level and I literally felt like everything was against me all week. Last 2 nights I was quietly sobbing holding my son thinking about blowing up my whole life because I was so sleep deprived and defeated and taking everything personally from my H. Today I am finally seeing a light. I think I had some wins and have been doing better with finding evidence of my SFPs.

My wins:  
1. we were off together Sat-Mon. Sat morning he went to get coff, usually I’ll “control” the situation and say are you going to get coffee (duh), will you get me one or would it be better if I mobile order would that help?!?!?! This time I did nothing. DT to the max. got up got kids bfast and let out dog then went back in bed smiling reading my book on phone. He left and came back with a coffee for me. Same thing happened all 3 mornings! This is evidence of my SFP “my H cares about me and wants to make me happy” AND “my H is a thoughtful guys and does nice things for me”. 
2. Laid next to him in bed and watched a show, didn’t touch him because I was being a chicken thinking he’d be annoyed I tried to cuddle him (his body language was telling me nah). Once it was over he was going to gym and he rolled towards me and was resting his eyes for a min. I decided to be bold and used a playful phrase that told him I wanted to give him a bj and he was very into the whole thing and made me feel very wanted then he paused it told me he wanted sex and made sure I was taken care of before himself.
3. Self care was on point today. Had 2 hot showers, did my hair and makeup, put on perfume, tonight did my extended skincare routine. Read for 10 mins, listened to a podcast for 30 min, gave myself a quick O for stress relief, let my kids trash my bedroom and watch tv in bed with popcorn for an hour while H was at the gym so I could have an hour of peace 😂
4. Our daughter is challenging and some days everything can be a power struggle. This week she has been extra sensitive and H has been so much more patient, loving and supportive with her. Today he was really struggling, they were fighting about literally everything, she was being kind of an ungrateful brat and I wanted to step in but I refrained. He said a few things to her that I didn’t love, but I just stayed DT. At one point in the night I stepped in only because he was starting to yell and I could tell he needed a min to cool off bc he doesn’t yell at her. I called her out of the room and helped her find a way to reset and take a break from the power struggles from H. The rest of the night went well and after kids were asleep I went over and rubbed his leg a little and asked if he was doing ok. I kinda expected him to shut down but surprisingly he opened right up! Told me she was so hard today and he didn’t know why he couldn’t keep his cool with her. Used IHY, nodded and listened and reassured. He told me he hates when he gets like that and feels like a terrible dad and person. I used a little SFP type thing more dad than spouse but it fit by saying you are an amazing dad and you care so much about your family. He actually talked to me a few mins about his struggles with our daughter and how he was feeling and I felt like this was a BIG win bc he’s been so shut down, broody, moody all the time with me it seems. Kept massaging his legs during this to keep him relaxed and body language was relaxed and open to me. 5.He opened up about him feeling like crap about his body right now because he was seeing a lot of progress but 10 days off of the gym due to small injury? combined with a lot of take out and alcohol. He asked if I thought he looked bad and I answered honestly that I think he looks greatz he gave me a look like you always say that. He gets self conscious about belly area and I told him I can still see his abs and started kissing his stomach area and told him how hot I think he is and how strong he is. Told him I can’t keep my hands off him. Opening up and talking to me again back to back? Win! Giving me a chance to stroke his ego for him? Win! 
6.kept massaging his legs during it all (trying to find ways to incorporate his long language of physical touch w/o being clingy or smothering him). When I was sure he was done talking to me and started to watch the game again I kept rubbing legs and stomach and I was very turned on at this point and could see he was too so I took care of him and he just enjoyed (actually felt like he was relaxed and enjoyed, sometimes I feel like I am bothering him when I initiate BJs bc he isn’t vocal even tho he told me sometimes he’s jus tired relaxed doesn’t mean he’s not into it) PI twice in a day feels like a win to me either way but both times felt like he was in it with me.

Challenges:
1. Fighting the urge to expect him to get off the fence about our marriage after 3 weeks of LD. Balance of having faith in my marriage vs expectation has been hard. Telling myself He didn’t feel this bad about things overnight, it won’t fix overnight.
2. Vulnerability- I keep thinking about kissing him and in a previous post someone suggested since we are PI this might be a good time to test a kiss. I tell myself I will try to make our next PI session I initiate more intimate and less just sex (we haven’t kissed at all in 3 months since sep started). The way to do this feels like me on top but I haven’t felt confident enough to do it my worries keep creeping in (how big my stomach is, ik he likes me on top but I could never get him off like this I’m not great at the position height/body size diff makes it a hard, also scared he’ll reject my kiss even during PI.) working on extra self care, and self love with positive manifestations.
3.vulnerablity again (shocking lol). Been wanting to say I miss you and others like I miss holding your hand,cuddles,hugs,kisses, etc. can’t find the courage yet. Everytime I think he’s softened towards me and I should do it he hardens again and I chicken out. I am expecting him to reject me so I’m not letting myself be vulnerable. Working on this same as above but think this one I need to wait til I am past possible PMS before I can be vulnerable without expectations and not let myself fall apart if H isn’t receptive. 
4. Starving OW of oxygen. Doing it with him, but my brain is still struggling. I can’t stop seeing her name on snapchat pop up on his phone. But I am not getting a stomach ache everyday from these thoughts so I know I’m getting better! When I feel the thoughts creeping in I tell myself my SFP related to this “My H is an honest and trustworthy man who is dedicated to me and our family.”

I'm a Swede, currently living in India. Me and my fiancé fell in love with your country while visiting this autumn, and tomorrow, we're moving to Nuwara Eliya (my favorite place on earth, after living in more than 20 countries) on an extended tourist visa at first, but with plans to stay for the forseeable future.

I have some really dumb questions, and while I very much get that it is not your job to walk me through them, I would be super grateful if any of you would find the time to point me in the right direction.

1. What is the best sim card? I see many mentioning Dialog, but can a foreigner sign up for a plan, or is pay-as-you-go? And what is the most reliable up in Nuwara Eliya with surroundings? 

2. I get that as foreigners, we won't have the same access to the normal renting market, but is there a good site/Facebook group for finding an apartment? We're reliable, pretty boring people, and being stuck in an airBnB is neither economical, nor very homely. Our plan right now is going to Nuwara Eliya with one month AirBnB, and ask around - is this dumb and naive? Should we live somewhere less touristy if we like high mountains and clean air and don't mind not having all comforts (but without drivers license). Also, what should we expect to pay per month for like a two bed room apartment, no frills? We don't want to be cheap, but we don't want anything fancy - we just want to live like normal people.

3. How do we best learn Sinhala? Like I understand there are language schools, but we won't be in Colombo. Are there any good resources? I realise I won't be fluent ever, but I just want to be able to be polite to people, buy vegetables and not inconvenience people as a start.

4. Lastly, but most importantly: how do we do our best to ensure we are good immigrants? What are the things you hate most with people moving here? What are the things people are oblivious to from abroad? We are both super mindful of not being rude, on purpose or by accident. I'm obviously not gonna go around half naked, and my Indian fiancé is not gonna have hissyfits and demand people speak Hindi, but apart from that - what are some nuances that we dumb foreigners often miss? 

Also, if anyone wants to hang out, give me a shout. We want to learn as much as possible and are always up for a coffee or a beer. ",10,1737458332.0,srilanka,9,1.0,False

I only leave it in ONE place.. by the coffee pot. WTF is going on?!?!

 Was so glad to be awake and now im wondering whats happening to my brain. 🧠  i
If i just switch dimensions (in theory) then that makes me upset because i left everything behind. Luckily another version of my dog is in this reality. But that would make me sad that i left her in the other dimension.. again this is all in theory.

At least all the posts i see are still the same and Pandora is playing the same music. Something to help keep me grounded. But that sugar thing has got me pretty upset and confused.

And it was probably unfair because it wasn't even all about you, even though my letter to you was.

Well. Thank you. You got to me at just the right time. And with just the right thing. And that little froggie of yours was lifting more than just weights, and I went to bed with my spirit once again aloft, at least when it comes to you…

But it got me thinking, and not for the first time… the meme exchange thing we do is *great*. I hope we *always* do it. We've been building our connection piece by teeny tiny piece with it, letting each other know that we're in each other's thoughts, all that good stuff. It is *fantastic*.

But if I *really* wanna show you that I love you (and I do. I do.), there's actually this really simple thing I could do - or, do a whole lot more, since it wouldn't be completely new:

I could follow one up with ""What's up?"" or… ""How's it going?"" or… anything, really. Just… something *more*.

Someone very special to me demonstrated that a few months ago, you know. And I still remember how it made my heart feel. And I just want you to feel that very same thing.

(It was you, by the way, that very special-to-me person. Just, you know, to be clear)

I know. I probably should have caught on a *lot* earlier. I just get blinded sometimes by… I dunno… the *everything else*.

But I'm working on it. I'm growing.

Which reminds me… maybe instead of dumping on a character who, truth be told I rather like, I should recognize that maybe Rory spent all those centuries growing, while still maintaining his essential Rory-ness.

And maybe I've been growing, while maintaining (and even reclaiming) my essential me-ness. At least I hope I am.

Yeah. I like that. I hope you do, too.

Also I haven't watched that story arc since probably when it first aired so honestly I hope my memory of it being sweet is correct, lol.

Anyways, baby, I've been rambling for a while now. Probably shoulda waited til the coffee was ready, this whole thing maybe might've made more sense… but these thoughts have been bouncing around in my head all night and I figured I'd best let them out as soon as I can. Sorry for the mess.

And I do love you. You are my shining star.

\- Among the hotels around City Center Mall, have you tried S, S Plaza or Swiss-bell Hotels?  Or some Airbnb establishments in the same areas.  I usually like to walk around in the morning and adjacent mall helps in getting some quick buys. 

\- I've seen that the farmers market will be in the same period at the Ritz lobby.  What's the activities usually?

Ciao a tutti!  Planning a trip to Italy?  Fantastic!  But before you pack your bags, let's brush up on some Italian customs and social etiquette.  Knowing the local norms will not only enhance your travel experience but also show respect for the rich Italian culture.

**Greetings and Introductions:**

* **The Kiss:**  In Italy, it's common to greet friends and family with two kisses on each cheek (one on each side).  However, this is usually reserved for people you know well. With acquaintances, a simple handshake is perfectly acceptable.
* **Formal vs. Informal:**  Use ""Lei"" (formal ""you"") with older people, strangers, or those in positions of authority.  Use ""Tu"" (informal ""you"") only after being invited to do so. Don't worry too much – most Italians are understanding of tourists making mistakes.
* **Saying ""Buongiorno"" and ""Buona Sera"":** These are essential greetings. ""Buongiorno"" is used from morning until the early afternoon, while ""Buona Sera"" is used from the afternoon onwards.

**Dining Etiquette:**

* **Pace Yourself:** Italians savor their meals, taking their time to enjoy the food and company. Don't rush your meal.
* **Bread is for dipping:** It's perfectly acceptable (and even expected) to use bread to soak up delicious sauces.
* **Ordering:** Ordering multiple courses is common. Don't be afraid to indulge in antipasti, primo (first course), secondo (main course), contorno (side dish), and dolce (dessert)!
* **Coffee Culture:**  Coffee in Italy is typically consumed quickly, standing at the bar.  Ordering a cappuccino after midday is considered unusual. Stick to espresso after breakfast.
* **Tipping:**  A tip isn't obligatory but is appreciated for exceptional service.  Rounding up the bill or leaving a small amount is usually sufficient.

**Shopping Etiquette:**

* **Saying ""Grazie"" and ""Prego"":**  Always say ""Grazie"" (thank you) and ""Prego"" (you're welcome).
* **Bargaining:**  Bargaining isn't typically done in stores, except perhaps in smaller markets or with street vendors.
* **Opening hours:**  Shops may close for a few hours in the afternoon, a common practice known as the ""riposo"" (rest).


**Other Important Considerations:**

* **Dress Code:**  While Italy is generally relaxed, dressing respectfully, especially when visiting churches or religious sites, is important. Avoid wearing shorts or sleeveless tops inside religious buildings.
* **Public Transportation:**  Validate your tickets before boarding public transportation to avoid fines.
* **Noise Levels:**  Italians are generally quite animated and expressive, and louder conversations are common. Don't be surprised by this!
* **Punctuality:** While punctuality is appreciated, being a few minutes late is usually not a major issue in social settings.  However, for appointments or business meetings, punctuality is more important.



By understanding these basic customs and etiquette guidelines, you'll be well-prepared to navigate the beautiful country of Italy with confidence and respect. Buon viaggio! (Have a good trip!)

So, my sister and I went to All That’s Coffee in Manish Nagar. While waiting for our order, I noticed this guy who seemed to be in his late 50s. He gave off a very typical lonely uncle vibe. Anyway, I ignored him like I usually do with strangers.

Our order was ready, and as we were about to leave, he suddenly asked, ""You stay nearby, right? Your surname is ppppppp?"" (some random surname). I politely said, ""No, sorry, I don’t know who you are."" He just smiled and said, ""No problem.""

In my head, I was like, “Social interaction is the last thing I want right now.” I whispered to my sister, ""Let’s go somewhere else to drink this coffee."" But before we could leave, the uncle started talking again.

He said, ""Aapki tarah mera bhi ek beta hai."" I replied, ""Acha acha."" Then he said, ""Woh abhi US me padhai kar raha hai."" At that point, I didn’t give two shits about who he was or what his son was doing, but honestly, as humans, we automatically feel aww, how lonely he must be, especially with older people. So, I thought, fine, let’s just talk for a bit and then leave.

He was loud, his voice could reach inside the cafe and everyone was able to listen.

He continued, ""I am also a doctor in Medical College Nagpur."" I was like, ""Acha uncle, badhiya hai. Aapke family ko line me wait nahi karna padta hoga, right?"" He laughed. Then I said, ""Chalo uncle, I’ll go now,"" but he kept asking more questions.

“Beta, what do you do?” he asked. I told him. Then he asked about my company and position. That’s when I asked, ""Uncle, sorry, but why do you want to know?"" I still told him, though.

Then out of nowhere, he goes, ""Aapko pata hai, abhi Trump firse jit gaya hai."" I said, ""Yes, I know, I saw the news."" Then he randomly said, ""I was friends with Adani when I was young."" I was like, ""Nice, that’s cool.""

He asked, ""Do you know how much money Adani has?"" I said, ""I don’t know."" He gave me some random number and said, ""Aapko yeh sab baatein pata honi chahiye, abhi bade ho gaye ho, bacche nahi ho.""

I was like, ""Uncle, aapko pata hai kya?"" He changed the topic. At this point, I was so done. I said, ""Ab hum jaate hain, hume late ho raha hai.""

But he kept going. ""Beta, mujhe waha tak chhod doge kya?"" I said, ""No."" Then he asked, ""Aapko pata hai petrol ka daam kya chal raha hai?"" I said, ""Check nahi kiya, aur mujhe late ho raha hai.""

At this point, I was furious. He asked, ""Who’s the CEO of this bike you’re riding?"" I straight-up asked him back, ""Do you know?"" He laughed it off again.

So, I made up a random company name, AND I MADE SURE I WAS LOUD ENOUGH—something like XYZ Medical Co.—and asked, ""Aapko pata hai iska naam? It’s a big medical company. You’re a doctor; you don’t know it? Shame. Aapko pata hona chahiye, right? Aap medicines prescribe karte ho, don’t you read the names? Ese hi de deti ho dawai?""

Then I switched and asked, ""Aapka beta kaha padta hai?"" He proudly said, ""US mein."" I asked, ""Kaunsi degree kar raha hai?"" He said, ""Law ki."" So, I asked, ""Uske college ka director kaun hai? Udhar diesel lagta hoga? Diesel ka bhav kya hai?""

At this point, my sister chimed in and said, ""Abhi aap jao, uncle."" Finally, he left, though it was clear he didn’t want to, but he noticed now that if he stay for longer, he won't win in his game.

LOL, what an exhausting interaction. Some people just want to prove they know everything. Honestly, I initially talked to him out of pity because he seemed so lonely, but man, that was draining!

Always wanted to give Tamnavulin one a try (the sherry one), but this one was on sale so couldn't pass on the opportunity.

To summarize: It did not disappoint.
Interestingly it lived up to its potential, and I got almost all the notes as written on the bottle.
Chill filtered, colored, 40% ABV.

Tasted in tulip glass. Rested for 5 minutes.

Nose: medium strong, flowers, sweet oranges (caramelized oranges), bit of vanilla and some kind of jam (fig jam? maybe?)

Palate: white chocolate and toffee are quite noticeable. Red berries (raspberry flavor), peach and unfortunately couldn't taste the coffee flavor.

Finish: medium; it was nice and smooth, sweet with a hint of fresh apricot.

Rating: 81/100

For the price of 20Eur, definitely worth it.

Not so complex, and beginner friendly.

1i6fwht,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i6fwht/ecofriendly_decoration_ideas_for_a_sustainable/,Eco-Friendly Decoration Ideas for a Sustainable and Stylish Home,"Creating a home that’s both stylish and sustainable is easier than ever, thanks to the growing availability of eco-friendly [decoration items](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration). From natural materials to energy-efficient designs, incorporating sustainable practices into your decor not only helps the environment but also adds timeless charm and character to your living space. Here are some eco-friendly decoration ideas to inspire your sustainable home makeover.

# 1. Opt for Natural Materials in Furniture and Decor

One of the easiest ways to make your home more eco-friendly is by choosing decor made from natural, renewable materials like bamboo, jute, or rattan. A [rattan basket](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/baskets), for example, is a versatile piece that can be used for storage or as a decorative accent. It’s lightweight, durable, and adds a touch of organic texture to any room.

**Styling Tip:** Use rattan baskets to store throws in your living room or to organize laundry in your bathroom. Pair them with other natural materials like wooden furniture for a cohesive, sustainable look.

# 2. Shop Local at Dubai Home Decor Stores

Supporting local businesses not only reduces the carbon footprint associated with shipping but also allows you to discover unique, handcrafted pieces. Many [Dubai home decor stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) now feature eco-conscious collections, offering everything from sustainably sourced furniture to artisanal decoration items.

**Pro Tip:** Look for items like handcrafted rugs, reclaimed wood furniture, or locally made pottery to add authenticity and sustainability to your space.

# 3. Incorporate Multi-Functional Decor

Invest in pieces that serve multiple purposes to minimize waste and clutter. A [ceramic big vase](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/ceramic-beige-vase-l), for instance, can double as a striking centerpiece and a vessel for fresh or dried flowers. Its timeless design makes it a sustainable choice that never goes out of style.

**Styling Idea:** Choose a neutral-toned ceramic vase to match various interior styles, from minimalist to bohemian. For an eco-friendly twist, fill it with dried flowers or branches sourced from your garden instead of buying artificial flowers.

# 4. Repurpose and Upcycle

Give new life to old furniture and decoration items by repurposing or upcycling them. An old ladder can become a stylish towel rack, while glass jars can be turned into candle holders or planters. Upcycling not only reduces waste but also allows you to create one-of-a-kind pieces for your home.

**Creative Idea:** Paint an old wooden chest and use it as a coffee table or storage bench. Personalize it further with eco-friendly paints or stains.

# 5. Choose Sustainable Storage Solutions

Decluttering your space sustainably can be both practical and stylish. Items like rattan baskets are perfect for storing toys, magazines, or other household essentials while adding a rustic charm to your decor. For kitchens and pantries, use glass jars or recycled containers instead of plastic.

**Eco-Friendly Note:** Use storage solutions to organize sustainably by categorizing items and donating those you no longer need instead of discarding them.

# 6. Embrace Indoor Plants for Natural Beauty

Nothing brings life to a home quite like greenery. Indoor plants not only purify the air but also act as beautiful decorative accents. Pair plants with sustainable planters like ceramic pots or terracotta vessels.

**Styling Idea:** Use a ceramic big vase as a bold planter for large plants like monstera or fiddle-leaf fig trees. Group smaller plants in rattan baskets for an eco-friendly, layered look.

# 7. Choose Energy-Efficient Lighting

Switching to LED lighting is a simple way to make your home more eco-friendly. To enhance your decor, opt for pendant lights or floor lamps made from sustainable materials like bamboo or recycled metal. Energy-efficient lighting paired with thoughtful design can significantly reduce your carbon footprint.

# 8. Decorate with Recycled and Vintage Finds

Vintage and second-hand decor is a sustainable way to furnish your home while adding a unique character. Explore flea markets and Dubai home decor stores that specialize in pre-loved or refurbished items. From antique mirrors to vintage rugs, these pieces are often made to last and bring a timeless charm to your interiors.

# 9. Use Eco-Friendly Textiles

Sustainable textiles like organic cotton, hemp, or linen are excellent for cushions, throws, and curtains. These materials are not only eco-friendly but also incredibly durable and stylish. Pair them with natural accents like rattan or wicker for a cohesive look.

**Why Go Eco-Friendly?**

Opting for sustainable decoration items isn’t just a trend—it’s a lifestyle choice that benefits the planet while enhancing your home’s aesthetic. With options like rattan baskets, ceramic big vases, and local finds from Dubai home decor stores, you can create a space that reflects your values while staying effortlessly stylish.

The Kendu community has prevailed.

There is no shortage of quiet days in crypto. Drama, scandals and anything else happening everywhere and anywhere at all times.

Kendu has just endured quite possibly the most difficult test of all.

For months we have been battling, working relentlessly and trying to push it to the masses. Admittedly though, There has been a hindrance. The dev was actively working to push the movement into the ground, often going against community desires and deliberately sabotaging efforts.

What was not realised though by the dev is the strength of the movement, the bonds forged and the people who have utmost conviction in Kendu.

Through a massive effort and overhaul from the community we have successfully completed a community takeover and now look forward in to the future.

This is a clean slate, a fresh start.

We look forward with an adaptable, transparent and decentralised approach.

We build now a picture of Kendu that is loved and adored, not represented by any singular person.

We successfully had the dev send back their remaining tokens in to our donations wallet, meaning they are out. These tokens can be used from anything between listings to spreading the name now, by the community.

We just weathered the most difficult storm that could have been thrown at us, and we are more alive than ever. We all stood to the the biggest test and completed it with solidarity. The TG has seen hundreds of old faces come back who left due to their unhappiness with the dev.

This is a community with the likes of several IRL products such as energy drinks and coffee, members with tattoos repping the movement, people who push the name in every which way possible.

A community who is the 2nd existing memecoin ever to complete a certik audit organically, the 2nd memecoin to have a stocktwits page and one that has been featured on T1 CEX campaigns and advertisements.

A community with one of the healthiest distributions in DeFi, an establishment like no other and a SOL wormhole.

\-------

What has been shown here is that the Kendu movement is unstoppable. A genuine brand, movement and a once in a cycle opportunity.

We now look forward with the lessons of the past, building a welcoming community. We invite everyone to jump on board now. There is absolutely nothing holding us back any longer

[The resposne](https://preview.redd.it/hwwfu9qssbee1.png?width=583&format=png&auto=webp&s=e400cc45e6c049214cace7c32596c7ac0f041bc4)

This is how people are responding to the news.

20E clips of past whales who had left but never forgotten. People have been waiting on the sidelines, along with KOLs and influencers alike who had always cherished the Kendu community. They are all coming back.

It is now the community who remains. Stronger then ever, consolidated and with nothing to stop us from sending this to the billions.

The community has always been the alpha. We ran it up to 280M mc in 2024, and now with 17000 holders we are ready to push it in the billions in 2025.

The Kendu community has prevailed.

There is no shortage of quiet days in crypto. Drama, scandals and anything else happening everywhere and anywhere at all times.

Kendu has just endured quite possibly the most difficult test of all.

For months we have been battling, working relentlessly and trying to push it to the masses. Admittedly though, There has been a hindrance. The dev was actively working to push the movement into the ground, often going against community desires and deliberately sabotaging efforts.

What was not realised though by the dev is the strength of the movement, the bonds forged and the people who have utmost conviction in Kendu.

Through a massive effort and overhaul from the community we have successfully completed a community takeover and now look forward in to the future.

This is a clean slate, a fresh start.

We look forward with an adaptable, transparent and decentralised approach.

We build now a picture of Kendu that is loved and adored, not represented by any singular person.

We successfully had the dev send back their remaining tokens in to our donations wallet, meaning they are out. These tokens can be used from anything between listings to spreading the name now, by the community.

We just weathered the most difficult storm that could have been thrown at us, and we are more alive than ever. We all stood to the the biggest test and completed it with solidarity. The TG has seen hundreds of old faces come back who left due to their unhappiness with the dev.

This is a community with the likes of several IRL products such as energy drinks and coffee, members with tattoos repping the movement, people who push the name in every which way possible.

A community who is the 2nd existing memecoin ever to complete a certik audit organically, the 2nd memecoin to have a stocktwits page and one that has been featured on T1 CEX campaigns and advertisements.

A community with one of the healthiest distributions in DeFi, an establishment like no other and a SOL wormhole.

\-------

What has been shown here is that the Kendu movement is unstoppable. A genuine brand, movement and a once in a cycle opportunity.

We now look forward with the lessons of the past, building a welcoming community. We invite everyone to jump on board now. There is absolutely nothing holding us back any longer

Brain health supplements can help, but only if you know what to look for.

Here’s an honest guide to building a better brain with a mix of supplements, food, and proven strategies.

# What Makes a Good Brain Supplement?

A solid brain supplement should support mental clarity, focus, and long-term cognitive health.

The key is finding ingredients backed by science and avoiding anything overhyped.

Here are some of the best options:

* **Huperzine A:** Boosts memory and learning by increasing acetylcholine levels, a neurotransmitter essential for brain function.
* **Choline (and Alpha-GPC):** Supports acetylcholine production and helps with focus and memory. Found in supplements and naturally in eggs.
* **Lion’s Mane Mushroom:** Aids in nerve regeneration and long-term cognitive support.
* **Agmatine:** May protect the brain from stress and improve mood regulation.
* **Caffeine:** Yes, coffee counts. Caffeine is a natural nootropic that boosts focus, reaction time, and mental clarity. Just don’t overdo it.
* **Green Coffee Bean Extract:** Offers antioxidants and supports brain energy without overstimulating like regular caffeine.
* **Magnesium Threonate:** A unique form of magnesium that supports memory and learning by crossing the blood-brain barrier.

# How Caffeine Fits In

Caffeine is often overlooked as a nootropic, but it’s one of the most effective options for boosting focus and productivity.

* A single cup of coffee can improve reaction time and alertness.
* Pairing caffeine with **L-Theanine** (found in tea) balances its stimulating effects with calm focus.
* For best results, avoid consuming caffeine late in the day to protect your sleep.

# How to Build a Brain Stack

To maximize benefits, combine a few complementary supplements. Here’s a simple stack:

1. **Morning:** Caffeine + L-Theanine + Alpha-GPC. This combo provides energy, focus, and memory support.
2. **Midday:** Lion’s Mane + Green Coffee Bean Extract for sustained mental clarity.
3. **Evening:** Magnesium Threonate + Huperzine A for relaxation and memory reinforcement while you sleep.

Always start with lower doses to see how your body reacts, and don’t add too many new supplements at once.

# Don’t Forget Your Diet

Supplements are helpful, but your diet is just as important. Focus on foods that support brain health, such as:

* **Eggs:** A natural source of choline for memory and focus.
* **Fatty Fish:** Packed with omega-3s, critical for brain cell structure.
* **Leafy Greens:** Loaded with vitamins that fight oxidative stress.
* **Nuts and Seeds:** Great for sustained energy and brain protection.

Think of supplements as a boost, not a replacement for good nutrition.

# Red Flags to Watch Out For

Be cautious of products that:

* Claim instant results or unrealistic benefits.
* Have proprietary blends without disclosing dosages.
* Include ingredients with no real scientific backing.

Stick to reputable brands and always research the ingredients.

# Final Thoughts

Improving brain health is a journey, not a quick fix.

With the right combination of supplements, healthy eating, and good habits, you can make real progress over time.

My skincare routine varies as nothing seems to help, and to be honest I’m a bit lost and fed up with trying things and nothing working. I’ve just been doing a simple routine rn as I focus on healing my gut:

Ordinary squalene cleanser 
Clinique gel moisturiser
Salicylic acid mask x2 a week if my skins not feeling sensitive

1i6fl14,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1i6fl14/i_feel_so_alone/,I feel so alone.,"My (28F) social life is crumbling, and I honestly don’t know what to do. I feel disconnected from everyone and everything lately, I feel like I’m expendable and unlovable. I’m the one friend that’s always reaching out and I’m getting tired of it. I used to think it was no big deal, since we're all pretty bussy with life, but now I've reached a breaking point where I feel lonely, sad and unlovable by the people I chose to have around. 

I'll give an example: I have a very close friend from college whom I know hates chatting on the regular and we get together every other month when usually I reach out to her. 
She got engaged and sent me a picture of the big moment, called me and met up for coffee 2 weeks later. She said it was nice seeing me and that we should do it on the regular so we can catch up, she told me I was obviously invited to the wedding. In my country, we celebrathe de ""civil wedding"" which takes place at city hall, and on a later date have the ""official wedding"". I wasn't invited to the bachelorette party, nor the civil wedding... I saw someone post an Ig story about it and that's how I knew about it. 

I texted my friend congratulating her and she only replied with ""thanks babyyyy 🤍🤍🤍"" and that was it. I'm letting a little time pass by so she gets to enjoy these goals, and we can talk face to face, since she moved to another region, about 6-8 hrs away. 

I also broke up with the one partner I saw myself marrying because he felt he wasn't ready and other issues we were going through, and I'm feeling so lonely, and I feel it's my fault. These have not been the only instances contributing with these feelings I'm experiencing, but I'd say I've been feeling worse since it happened.

I thought I was loved by the people around me, now I guess I lied myself into believing so...
