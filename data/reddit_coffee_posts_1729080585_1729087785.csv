I'm concerned because I read somewhere that hyper activity like that could mean the baby is in distress. I do have an OB appointment tomorrow and will bring it up then, but does this happen to anyone else? This is my second and it's been almost 10 years since I was pregnant last.

After closing most of its store, It started to rebound only after local company bought remaining stores and change focus away from coffee. It is said Australia have strong coffee culture brought by Italian immigrants. CNBC have good video about it. [Link](https://youtu.be/_FGUkxn5kZQ?si=r-ukq9xXorqhI1bS)

But Australia isn't only country with Italian diaspora. America have large Italian population since 19th Century. That's faster than Australia, where it got mass Italian immigration only after WW2. But America didn't have Italian coffee culture. Starbucks initially pitched as bringing Italian coffee to Americans. 

My question is, America have longer history of Italian immigration than Australia. But Italian coffee effected later, not former. How did this happen?

And right after birth, he was amazing, I had a very complicated birth, HELLP syndrome, abruption, emergency c section, and 21 days in the nicu for our baby, my fiancé was amazing during all of that, but it's gradually been going downhill.

I've been wondering why when I get a decaf from dutch bros or some other coffee restaurants why my caffiene sensitivity symptoms appear. I've been keeping track everytime and have come to the conclusion that when they run the decaf beans through the grinder, they don't get rid of the regular beans already in the grinder, so you are getting almost if not a whole dose of caffiene instead of decaf. For example, I use to own a espresso machine, I would put my beans in the built in bean grinder and then remove them and put my husband's regular beans in. But before I would put my beans back in I flushed out all his regular beans and always got atleast 1 to 2 shots of grind before it emptied.

1g4zygj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1g4zygj/6_months_of_electrolysis_things_that_have_and/,6 Months of Electrolysis: Things that have and haven't worked for me,"I've been doing electrolysis for about 6 months now (stopped plucking at the beginning of May and got my first session on May 20th) and have been super happy with the results so far. I've gone from obsessively plucking tons of hairs daily to having some places in my hair cycle where the hair is fine enough that I don't feel the need to shave for a week! I had a nice mustache with some really thick hairs, as well as areas on either side of my chin with big patches of thick hair. I also had random thick hairs all over my cheeks and neck. I was dumb and didn't take pictures, so I don't have those to share. But I wanted to share some of the strategies that have helped me, because electrolysis has been an absolute boon for my mental health. I feel so much better, even though I still have a long way to go. It has been expensive, but 10000% worth it.

For context, my treatment has spanned two countries: Japan and the US. I credit Japanese skincare regimens for why electrolysis has been so effective without damaging my skin. So I wanted to share that regimen with everyone here. Keep in mind, electrolysis is a marathon, not a race. It takes time to work, so be patient. I went on an almost weekly basis for 4 months, and have now switched to doing it every two weeks. I'll still be going for awhile, but me next year is going to be so happy that I started this journey a year before. Do it for future you.

**Pre-Treatment:**

HYDRATE: 

I cannot stress this enough. Electrolysis is more effective when the skin is moisturized and not dry. And no amount of moisturizer on your face is going to overcome not drinking water. Drink more water everyday, regardless of when your treatments are. You'll find other benefits as well, I stopped bloating as much and dropped water weight after about 3-4 weeks of drinking more water everyday. If you take away only one tip from this post, it should be this one.

GENTLE SKINCARE: 

Your skin is going to need to heal, so avoid using harsh treatments and fragrances on your skin. Japanese skincare is all about being gentle, and their tips really have helped. Use a gentle cleanser, and pair it with a gentle exfoliating cleanser. I have sensitive and oily skin with a nice case of rosacea, so I pair La Roche-Posay's Medicated Gel Cleanser (2% salicylic) with their Toleraine gentle face wash. Over time, I've found that electrolysis has dried out some of my oily skin, so I switched from a mattifying moisturizer to a more moisturizing one. My acne has decreased a ton since I first started electrolysis, so that's been another bonus. The morning of my appointments, I like to use my exfoliating cleanser and then put on a solid layer moisturizing cream. The goal is to make my follicles open and extra juicy. 

No makeup or sunscreen that day either, I want nothing blocking my follicles. However, you should be wearing sunscreen everyday you're not getting treated. You're already putting your skin through a lot, don't let the sun damage it as well.

CAFFEINE/ALCOHOL:

Personally I found that my regular cup of coffee in the morning didn't affect my pain levels, but the caffeine withdrawal headache I got without it sure made the process worse. So test for yourself whether you need to skip the caffeine. In Japan, they recommend not drinking alcohol 2 days before and 3 days after treatment. Alcohol dries out your skin and increases your internal body temperature, which gets in the way of healing. 

**Treatment**:

NUMBING CREAM:

Get a stronger numbing cream from your electrologist if you can. I managed to get 10.5% lidocaine here in the US, and it's so helpful. An hour before your appointment, first rub a thin layer onto your face where you'll get treatment. Then, put a nice THICK layer of cream on top, and cover it with cling-wrap. You can put a mask over it to hold everything in place. This helps the medicine be more effective. It really works, even if it looks ridiculous. Being able to take a higher level of energy will make the treatments more effective, so use numbing cream and take your favorite painkiller before your appointments.

FIND A GOOD ELECTROLOGIST:

This one is obvious. A tip is to look through forums to find trans-friendly electrologists. They'll know how to kill the thick hairs. 

BE CONSISTENT:

I went weekly for an hour each for 4 months, and now have been able to drop to 30-45 minutes every two weeks. Your timing and length of sessions will depend on how much hair you have. I recommend tracking them in excel, because over the months you'll be able to see a drop off in how much time your need. The data is really motivating. 

I've found that the dark but finer hairs died much more quickly, but even the really thick, darker hairs are coming back finer each time. If you have a much thicker beard or mustache, remember that those dark hairs often take a few hits to kill. But, after a few months you'll be able to feel that the hairs are finer and softer. Don't get discouraged, it will take longer, but you will be happier with the results after a year or 2 of treatment than if you had gotten no treatment at all.

**Post-Treatment:**

COOLING ALOE GEL:

Find 100% aloe and keep it in your fridge. Bring it with you to your appointment, and immediately after put the cool gel on treated areas for 5-10 minutes. Then, gently wipe it off. Depending on your skin, you may want to gently wash your face afterwards to avoid acne. After this initial treatment, apply the aloe 3 more times in the first 24 hours, then 2 more in the next 24, and finally just once on the last day. They do this in Japan to lower your skins temperature, which helps avoid pitting, burns, scabs, and helps your skin heal more quickly. Even after returning to the US and getting an electrologist that uses a much higher setting, I've barely scabbed after continuing this treatment.

AVOID RAISING YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE:

Same logic as above. In Japan they recommend in the week after that you avoid hot baths and showers, exercise where you sweat, spicy food, and alcohol as these raise your internal body temperature. This helps with healing and avoiding scars. Personally, I found that just avoiding these the three days after treatment worked. Over time, my skin has toughened up and I don't get as red as I got used to it. But for the first couple months, my skin got pretty angry with me if I got hot and sweaty after treatment, and following these tips helped.

CONTINUE WITH GENTLE SKINCARE:

Keep up with the gentle skincare. Avoid over washing or picking at acne or scabs. Avoid makeup for the first few days after treatment, but please use sunscreen. Get a gentle fragrance-free sunscreen to avoid irritating your skin. 

  
I hope these tips help! A lot of them can be found across other platforms, but I just wanted to reiterate how important they are. Electrolysis is EXPENSIVE, and it's a waste of money unless you're willing to consistently do treatments and take care of your skin. If you do it right though, it really does work, and I'm so happy I started.

Yung jeep na sinakyan namin ay may dalawang conductor, isa mukhang teenager at isa naman parang na sa 20s na siya.

Sa lugar namin, 13 pesos ang minimum fair rate ng jeep, para sa dalawang kilometro at pababa. Isang kilometro lamang ang layo ng coffee shop kung saan kami galing at sa mall na aming pupuntahan.

Nung na sa jeep na kami, nagbayad kami agad ng 40 pesos ng aking kasama, at sinuklian naman kami agad, kaso lang 10 pesos lang ibinalik. Dapat 14 pesos sukli namin ng aking bff. Nagtinginan kaming dalawa, at tinanong ko kung ito lang ba ang sukli sa aking kaibigan, at sinabi niya naman ""oo.""

Hindi ko alam kung ano pumasok sa isip ko, bigla ko nalang tinanong yung conductor ""asan na po yung 4 pesos?"" Hindi siguro inakala ng conductor na tatanungin ko sya ng ganito. Pero wala siyang nasumbat sakin ng maayos at ng kanyang kasama.

Pinili ko magsitahimik, kasi nga naramdaman ko ang pag-iiba ng hangin sa jeep. Nagtahimik ang aking kasama at ng mga ibang tao sa jeepney. 

Pero, nung malapit na kami sa mall, bigla kong hiningi muli ang 4 pesos sa isang conductor. Tas nagtarayan kaming dalawa sa isa't-isa. Pinaglaban ko talaga yung 4 pesos na yun, kasi para sa akin, dapat lang maibalik sa akin yung sukli ko ang ng kaibigan ko ng tama.

Hanggang sa binigay na sa akin ang 4 pesos at hinati na namin ng aking kaibigan ang sukli. Kinaya ko pa mag ""thank you"" sa conductor. Nung oras na ito, may ilang minuto pa kami bago bumaba sa mall, kaya naman narinig ko magkwentuhan ang dalwang conductor, inis at galit ang lumalabas sa kanilang mga salita.

Long story short. I got fatshamed by the 2 conductors. And everyone in the jeep most likely heard their comments, it did not phase me, as I could care less of their opinion.

(Additional info: I'm overweight, yet very kikay, so in this gala, I was wearing a very girly fit, and maybe they thought that I was one who can be taken advantage of, di ako ganyan when it comes sa mga sukli, kasi I'm a commuter, ano anong klaseng problema na naranasan ko habang nagcocommute.)

Nagbaba naman kami ng friend ko sa mall and we enjoyed our time there, however, ngayon na sa bahay na ako, I cannot but help overthink what happened.

Ang sa akin lang, this would have never had happened had they given me the right amount of change in the first place.

The thing is at the end of the day, 4 pesos lang yun, did I overreact in this situation? Should I have just let it go and have my peace with the conductor? ABYG na inaway ko yung conductor ng sinakyan kong jeep para lang sa 4 pesos na sukli?

PS: Di ko po first languange ang english and filipino/tagalog. Sorry for the grammatical errors in both languanges.

wie der Titel schon sagt will ich meinen ""Alten PC ein wenig aufrüsten"" und das ganze so günstig und gut wie möglich.

  
zu dem Alten PC:

Gekauft und selbst zusammen gestellt 2019

-Intel Core i5-9600K 3,7 GHz (Coffee Lake)

-Silverstone SST-PF240-ARGB Komplett-Wasserkühlung - 240 mm

-MSI MPG Z390 Gaming Plus, Intel Z390 Mainboard - Sockel 1151

-Corsair Vengeance LPX Series schwarz DDR4-2666, CL16 - 2x8 GB

-Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2070 Super Gaming OC 3X 8G, 8192 MB GDDR6

-Zalman 750EBT 80 PLUS Gold Netzteil - 750 Watt

-Kolink Observatory RGB Midi-Tower, Tempered Glass - schwarz

-ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro Series NVMe SSD, PCIe 3.0 M.2 Typ

  
Meine Idee:

-den i5 gegen den  Intel® Core™ i5-14600KF Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) up to 5.3 GHz

-Motherboard zu ASUS ROG STRIX B760-F GAMING WIFI Mainboard

- Ram zu Corsair VENGEANCE RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 6400MHz CL32 Intel XMP iCUE

-GPU etc. wollte ich erstmal noch so behalten.

  
Das ganze könnte ich für ca. 500€ haben.  ( wäre auch mein maximum )

  
Frage ist nun kann man das so machen und lohnt sich das überhaupt? ich bin kein wirklicher AMD Fan und würde gern bei Intel bleiben.

  
ich danke euch schon mal :)

(interaction with stranger) When people find out you're autistic people, do you get the sense that you've been reclassified as a 75-percent person and Wikipedia blurb in their minds?","Edit: I accidentally put people in the title twice. That's going to make my brain itch.

TL; DR: I think even people who know us put us in a mental bucket with a list of attributes typical of ASD people once they find out we are autistic, even if if they had a pretty good handle on our personalities before that.

Also TL;DR: People don't actually think we are all a little autistic or that you do or don't look autistic--well, maybe they do, but that's not the point of the post. They're just using it as a canned acceptance platitude, possibly with a skeptical mental eye roll.

Also Also TL;DR: Is it actually still a bad idea to be openly autistic, given the actual biases people still have versus the ones they say they do or don't have?

I usually just post my art, but I do peruse most of the threads here, and it's making me aware of a lot of the misconceptions and biases people have about autistic people even now. I've known I was autistic for almost two decades, and I used to try pretty hard to hide it because I used to care what people thought of me, and also because I had to make a living. Since I recently started posting art here and elsewhere, it has gotten me thinking about how putting in my bio that I'm autistic might make some people dislike me or my art before they even see it, or they might try to shove anything I create through some mental filter that makes it better align with what they think they know about ASD people. I had put it in my bio initially because I thought it might shed some light on why some of my art processes are unconventional, but I wonder now if I'm giving the majority of people a knee-jerk negative impression.

In more recent years, coinciding with me giving fewer hoots what most people think about me, I'd seen more visibility regarding ASD and ADHD, and I'd thought it was now fine to be openly autistic. But seeing the autistic conversion camp post earlier today and other similar posts, I'm realizing that a lot of people seem to harbor overt animosity towards ASD people, possibly to a degree that's greater than five years ago.

It often seems like even the people who make a token effort to be accepting of neurodivergence/ASD still often do so through a pretty rigid lens where they attribute whatever stereotype they saw on TV or read about in passing and apply the whole package to all of us.

My wife and I were talking earlier today about how ASD people can oftentimes hear or read something and operate under the assumption that what's being said is actually meant. The whole, ""honk if you like \_\_\_\_"" thing that was in a post a few days ago is a good example. A few times a day, I see posts or comments about the, ""we're all a little autistic,"" or, ""you don't look autistic,"" stuff, and I think these are really just a bandwagonesque platitudes people use when they don't consider themselves to be biased against autistic people. I don't think they actually think we are all a little autistic. I think it's some way of trying to reference some kind of amorphous affinity.

I can’t imagine being in that situation. 

But anyway every Halloween season most of our staff will chip in to make sure we have nice candy out for our customers and their kids for the month of October for Halloween. We’ve never had any problems in the past. 

But this year every single time we put out candy, people come in from off the streets and take handfuls to stuff in their pockets and it’s been gone same day or the next day. 12 days into October and we were completely out.

The homeless people in the area have been known to come in and swipe the small free stuff. In the past few years we’ve had homeless people come in and take water or coffee without being a customer, no big deal. This year they come in and completely wipe us out of all the creamers and hot chocolate packets. Though, even that I don’t really care about because it’s the company’s money. 

But, they don’t provide us a budget for Halloween candy. That’s just something the staff does because it feels festive and it makes the kids really happy. 

It just made it that much more obvious how terrible the housing situation is here in this city. It’s not the end of the world that we can’t put out any more candy, but I’m just pissed everything is that bad right now. It genuinely seems to be getting worse everyday. It’s getting so cold outside. Is someone helping these people?? I’m poor and live with my parents, there’s nothing I can do. (I can’t even buy another bag of Halloween candy 😭)

1g4zem3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1g4zem3/should_i_ask_him_out/,Should I ask him out?!,"First reddit post, sorry it's a long one!

Came across a really kind man recently. I'm 34F, he has to be somewhere around that. No ring, no photos of family/partner in office, tried finding socials and the accounts that are probably his don't seem to have been updated/used in years and have nothing showing any sort of relationships or family, just his hobby. Attracted to him, I wouldn't say no to a date.  
Here's why I'm unsure if he's into me, if I can ask him out, why I think there might be something:

Met him because I'm his customer. He works in the family business, a really successful, long-running great reputation biz with more than one location (don't want to give any specifics as I'd die if he saw this and didn't feel the same/was tied up with someone else). I didn't realize this until after we talked a few times on phone and meeting in person, because he emailed and I saw his surname. So, I'd assume he has a stake in it (but it wouldn't be his outright) and assume he thinks people would know he's one of the family anyway. Saying this because I have no interest in men for their wealth, but could see how others would set their eye on someone like him for financial reasons (plenty of people still genuinely looking at road frontage as a reason to date), and would be worried he'd think that's why if I do ask him out from knowing him as his customer. I also don't want to feel like I can't return to his business in future out of embarrassment. I used his business earlier this year for something routine (managed by someone else in a different department) and was planning on sticking with them as the previous business I was using had fucked me over.

This guy was beyond helpful and kind to me about why I was using their services (unfortunate damage repair to an item of mine). He sorted some extras, one in particular I'd be charged €€€ for if insurance doesn't cover it (had agreed different terms with insurance but wasn't keen on using it and was saying I'd go without while repairs were being done but he said take what I'm offering and don't worry if they don't cover it, I won't charge you). Other bits I asked to be fixed that were entirely separate to the damage repairs being covered, and therefore were my responsibility to pay, were sorted too - despite my insistence on paying my bill. This business is in an industry where no-one gets anything free. So there's that. This was far from a cup of tea at a bar people (Baby Reindeer, anyone?). 

But it was the chats we had that really have me wondering; both times I had to meet him in person he brought up friendly conversation about the teeny rural townland I'm from, that no-one knows/goes to unless they live there, but he has been to for a hobby of his. To me it felt like there was a spark and the conversation he brought up both times seemed sort of chosen to get conversation going if you get me. Like on the second visit I was just about giving up on the idea that he was into me until we stepped outside, and then he finally broke into casual convo by saying something along the lines of ""Oh yeah, I was wondering X during the week and was thinking you'd know as you're from Y so said I'd ask you""...lads it's 2024, Google exists, if he really was interested in the answer he wouldn't be waiting days for me to return right?!. So it felt like a sort of planned out way to get chatting (again in a nice way), and felt like he was saying he was thinking about me?! Or am I reading too much into it all?! His colleague eventually broke up the conversation as we were chatting away too long, so it was a rushed thanks-bye! But as I was hopping into my car I threw a ""if you're ever in Y..."" over my shoulder and hightailed it out of there. He smiled I think, but couldn't reply as I turned away and again, his colleague was there and actively talking to him now. Cringing since, because he couldn't be seen to be asking customers out especially not with his family's name above the door.

I know nothing else about him, no-one I could get to enquire. Extremely unlikely to bump into him out and about. He's been really kind and I found him attractive, my gut says he liked me, but it's been wrong before. My self-worth is on the ground and from a practical view, I have nothing to offer (student at 34, living at home, unemployed right now unfortunately). I haven't been dating (last relationship ended in April after a year and a half). I'm embarrassed about where I am in life and have no real meaningful/close relationships. I have an extremely strained relationship with my family that outsiders don't seem to understand. So there's a loud voice in my head saying it's too good to be true, you'll embarrass yourself more and you'll have to find a new business. I'm in a lonely place and want someone to share life with, but haven't had the confidence to put myself out there since my last breakup (he was a dick and I ended it).

If I'm being kind to myself I'd say I'm not unattractive (I'm no conventional beauty but I've had attention when I've looked in the past), I'm petite and in shape and I know I'm kind to others. I'm honest to a fault and like I said I'd never go for him just because of the business he's in or potential freebies, and don't want him to see me that way if he said no. I haven't got kids or anything that could complicate things like that. I just don't see how I'd be an instant hit in this case and I'm afraid it's desperation and loneliness that's clouding my judgement. He knows I'm a student though, and that I'm in the homeplace I think - because of the nature of the work I'd let him know before ever I met him in person that I haven't got the money to spend on replacements/new item, so I'm also not an attractive prospect as a customer if all this is a sales tactic. He knows I'm broke. 

Some friends said he definitely seems interested, ask him out for coffee because it's unlikely he can ask you. They don't know me well at all though and were just being encouraging girl friends, although one's husband said he has to be interested (only male POV I could get).

He said he'd be calling this week about the final bill for insurance, it'd be my last chance.

TL;DR: massive fear of rejection and low self-worth, unsure if I misinterpreted someone's kindness for something more. Or did he do everything he possibly could to signal he liked me  and get me to ask him out, when it would be seen as unprofessional on his end to ask me out first?! Ireland, what do you think???

# Chapter Three

  

How many times had I dreamed of this moment? How many nights had I imagined walking down the aisle, the love of my life waiting for me at the altar?

Everything was perfect. Almost everything. Except for the man standing at the end of that aisle, the man I was supposed to marry. The man whose eyes were filled with cold indifference instead of love. My heart ached, and I blinked back the tears threatening to spill, refusing to let them make a scene.

The ceremony was a blur, a haze of vows and traditions I barely registered. My thoughts were consumed with dread as I realized what awaited me — a home where I'd be alone with him, a man who clearly didn’t want me.

During the car ride back, Sorin sat as far away from me as the backseat allowed, his gaze fixed outside the window, his silence as heavy as the tension between us. I wanted to say something, anything to break the ice, but the fear of irritating him kept my lips sealed. I couldn’t help but glance at him, at his strong profile, every feature so painfully familiar from the countless times I'd admired him from afar.

“Quit staring. It's irritating.” His voice was icy, cutting through the silence like a blade. He cast me a brief glance, the look in his eyes sharper than his words.

“Sorry,” I whispered, my cheeks burning as I quickly looked away.

[*Italian Beige Sofa Bed*](https://pandacozycorner.com/products/italian-beige-sofa)



  
When we arrived at his house — no, his mansion — it felt like stepping into a dream, or rather, a nightmare. The place was as grand as one could imagine, but it held no warmth for me. It wasn’t a home; it was a gilded cage.

I followed him inside in silence, my stomach in knots as he led me to our bedroom. ""Our"" bedroom. I hadn’t expected that. Seeing the surprise on my face, he rolled his eyes and sighed. “My parents locked the other rooms. Apparently, they’re adamant that we sleep in the same one.”

Embarrassment washed over me. His parents clearly had hopes for this union that didn’t align with reality. He gestured towards the couch. “You’ll sleep there.”

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. As I approached the couch, I noticed a pillow and blanket already laid out, a silent but clear arrangement. I sank into the cushions, trying to make myself comfortable.

""Wait."" His sudden command startled me. I turned, finding him pinching the bridge of his nose, visibly conflicted.

He sighed heavily. “Never mind.”

Confused, I resumed my place on the couch. But before I could relax, he spoke again. “No, wait.” He looked exasperated, as if warring with himself. “You can... share the bed. If you’re comfortable.” 

I hesitated, my eyes drifting to the bed. It was large enough for both of us, but sharing it felt too intimate, too overwhelming. Still, the couch wasn’t exactly inviting either.

“Are you sure?” I finally asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded stiffly. “Yes.”

Taking a deep breath, I got up and slowly made my way to the bed. He laid down on one side, and I settled on the other, making sure to keep as much distance as possible. My back was to him, and I prayed that sleep would come quickly, though I doubted it would.

Just as I was starting to relax, I heard the sound of pillows being moved. I glanced over my shoulder to see him placing a row of pillows between us.

“I hope you don’t kick in your sleep,” he muttered, his tone dry.

Heat rushed to my face. ""I don’t think I do,"" I mumbled, though I wasn’t entirely sure.

The night passed in tense silence, but at some point, I must have drifted off. A sudden groan woke me, and I blinked groggily, trying to figure out what had happened. My heart sank when I realized that, in my sleep, I had somehow managed to kick Sorin in the chest.

“Oh my God, I’m so sorry!” I gasped, covering my mouth in horror.

He glared at me, jaw clenched, clearly in pain. He shoved my leg back over to my side of the bed and got up without a word, heading straight for the bathroom.

“I’m sorry,” I called out again, desperate for some form of forgiveness. “Does it hurt a lot?”

He ignored me, his face a mask of irritation as he disappeared into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. A tear slid down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Crying wouldn’t help. Nothing would.

I decided to make breakfast, hoping maybe it would soften the edges between us. By the time I finished, I heard him coming down the stairs, impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit. He looked just as handsome as ever, but he walked past the kitchen without a glance in my direction.

“Um… breakfast?” I stammered, trying to gather the courage to speak.

He paused for a fraction of a second, then continued walking toward the front door. Without so much as a word, he left, slamming the door behind him.

I stared at the untouched plates in front of me, my heart sinking further. I sat down at the table and forced myself to eat, though every bite tasted like ash. The lump in my throat grew with each passing second as the reality of my situation settled in.

Sorin would never love me. I was nothing more than an inconvenience to him, a burden he’d been forced to bear. My heart longed for something, someone to care about me, but all I had was emptiness.

Tears welled up again, but this time, I didn’t bother to fight them back. No one would see. No one cared.

I just wanted to be loved.

I’m on 30mg of Elvanse, and could slightly feel it maybe (I have no frame of reference).  
I tried it with vaping after 2 months, and the effect is an actual difference.
Not sure if this means I should (request a trail of ) a higher dosage, or how to proceed (beyond not vaping with it anyway).

Post:
I’ve been on 30mg of Elvanse for the last 2 months.
At first I didn’t really feel a difference other than the feeling of have a really good coffee that lasted all day. I’d cut out all coffee, and anything stimulating as instructed.  

I had my second review with my doctor, and she asked if I felt I needed an increase in dosage, but I said I wasn’t sure. (No frame of reference.). 
She arranged my next prescription, but this wasn’t done and I had a week without medication, and honestly, it didn’t feel remarkably different.    

I got my prescription the following week, after a week found an old vape and though I didn’t feel much different, I did notice I was getting on top of things without the normal pulling myself to the next tasks and breaks after everything.

Off the vapes, it was similar to the first month, like a decent all day coffee.  
I bought another vape again to test, and I was again (with my ADHD meds) getting on top of things like a “normal person”.  

I have no adverse side effects, or changes to health (yes I know vaping isn’t smart, I normally do it a few days every few months).

The PSA announcement yesterday was fun and great for the health of the company going forward. Bit by bit we will see these small add-ons to the business compound making something like SLOASS - at the very least - an inevitability (the writing is on the wall more and more every day). For now, however, we've got Oct OPEX to close out and we've got a fresh Q4 to think about (definitely check out yesterday's post if you missed it on some of these longer timeframe questions). Let's see what the Stonk's got cookin'!

**Price Movement Recap**

The main event yesterday was our premarket pop on the announcement of GME's new PSA collaboration. It is interesting to observe just how much even premarket movements are influenced by key levels in the options market - the stock pumped to within $0.01 of our $22 call wall - although the mechanics are somewhat opaque to me. 

[10\/15 Trading Day 1-min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/3hm42clxx3vd1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=72f2e01932d9ee066e86d44846cb7891ce37d360)

Despite the pullback on the 'sell the news' phenomenon, options flow were biased bullish on the day, especially late, where a number of traders began to stack up some sizable bullish bets both into 10/18 OPEX and 11/15 OPEX which is starting to see some notable expansions in call OI in a few places:

https://preview.redd.it/2a81mcvrz3vd1.png?width=1578&format=png&auto=webp&s=6aa280484d1f49342533900d78993420f98cc503

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

10/18 OPEX is showing a mix of OI changes in terms of expansion and contraction. $22 volume came in at the BID and ASK evenly, so it is difficult to determine which types of parties were taking profits yesterday. Otherwise, $20 and $21 Calls certainly expanded at the ASK, while Put OI changes were light, but at large retractions. Max Pain is still at $20. 

[10\/18 OPEX OI Changes 10\/15-10\/16](https://preview.redd.it/neqs99g114vd1.png?width=1857&format=png&auto=webp&s=da791da10fe18dd06fe72ad2b19c38fca9947441)

As mentioned above in the Price Movement section, we are starting to see some bigger OI changes for our November OPEX, specifically Calls at $20 and $21 which came in late yesterday at the ASK.

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 10\/15-10\/16](https://preview.redd.it/fy4pwwf424vd1.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=550ca34fae1238323578f3a87f4270eb333d6ab6)

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/a2zunkak24vd1.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=52fadc8f4cc07946ad46044396088d0ca4ffb882

Our MM GEX table is also showing some sweetness today. Between $21 and $22 we have a bona fide gamma ramp in position. If the price can dip to just below $21 (like it did in today's early premarket) there is a high concentration of Call Gamma that the right amount of bullish volume will blow like a powder keg. This is especially enabled by the amount of Call Gamma accumulated at $21.50. At the same time, if enough additional  Call OI can be stacked up at $22.50 in the midst of a gamma squeeze or in the trading days before one might occur, then we could see a run continue up to $23 given the amount of Call gamma already in position there. The most obvious parallel is our price action on 9/20 that took us from $19.50 to $22. 

**Technicals**

[8\/25-10\/16 1-Day Aggregation with Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/gxwoaptf44vd1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5e5d7b6ec4f16640113737effb31c89f85564ca)

So here is what I am expecting for the next two weeks or so with a big question mark on National Cat Day, 10/29. I've adjusted the SMAs to reflect the upward trends I outlined in yesterday's post. RSI still has a bit of room to run and our price action has already shown that the 50-Day SMA is more of a guideline than it is a strong wall, although notably our wicks on the past two daily candles have touched the 50-Day SMA \*to the cent\* before reversing back to mid-channel on the day. 

I'm expecting our price recovery to continue into 10/18 OPEX, though major deviations in our principal trading bracket will have to wait until later down the line. We might see a small correction down to the $21 area during next week's trading on what will probably be a pretty neutral week, followed by the approach to October 29 and whatever that wild card might bring. 

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/0yizmgr064vd1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=03a5c66c7d87d84fe246cfeb5f4525b5e92eb44a)

Our IV has recovered slightly given our price elevation over the past few days, though it is still staying close to YTD lows (81% as of yesterday's close). Continued upward price action will spell appreciation on this value while other appreciating factors will have to wait until around the week of Thanksgiving (about 6 weeks from now) to start their earnings pump. It will be intriguing to see what sort of events occur between now and then. With all the new PSA and trading card business GME has been committing to this year, Q3 earnings might surprise 'analysts' although notably, October has seen a major shift in analyst sentiment. 

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

We have a gamma ramp in place this week which promises high speed upward volatility up through $22 (possibly to $23 in the right circumstances, but maybe not until early next week, say, if the ramp is fired off on Friday) if approached from around $21 or just below. It does not have to be set off today (and indeed, might not until Friday), but the set-up looks conspicuously like what GME saw back on 9/20 for September OPEX. The big question mark is still 10/29 and our feline wild card, so I hesitate to extend my doodle to far after this. If nothing major happens, GME is still set up to enter into a slow bullish uptrend prefigured by technical indicators that institutions are likely prepping for as we head into Q4. 

Good luck out there!

Cheers

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",94,1729083888.0,Superstonk,14,0.94,False

1g4yv0z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g4yv0z,Thursday Boot Co. Black Label - Challengers in Maryam Black Teacore x Natural Veg tan Horserump (DomesDay initial pics+) ,"**INTRO**

These are Thursday's version of a PNW boot and I finally got these in the other day!! I had some shipping delays just like a lot of others with this release but luckily my pair found their way home lol. I placed my order the morning of the 26th on release but didn't get a proper shipping update until the 10th I believe and that was after some back and forth with customer service. In the end it all worked out and I'm more than pleased with my purchase. These are GORGEOUS boots!!! Now they're also my first entry into the Stitchdown Thunderdome Patina contest. 

**LEATHER**

I ordered my challengers in the teacore horse rump from Maryam to match my teacore jeans from pure blue japan. The leather is a beautiful oily black over a clean veg tan with slight texture from the grain. No calipers so I can't give a perfect measurement.. But with my tape measure I was able get about 3mm thickness on most parts of the leather. Some spots closer to 2.5mm and some spots closer to 4mm. This is some burly shit. The leather heel stack and welt are dyed and burnished a dark coffee brown for an almost tonal look. One thing I think is cool about the leather is that in direct sunlight they have slight brown tint to them. I'm a big fan of the black/brown combo. They also come with a set of long leather laces, teacore dyed to match, and 2 seperate sets of cord laces (short/long). I can't wait to see how these patina! 

**FIT**

I ordered these in the same size as my 2017 Captains, size 11D. Oh boy, these fit like a dream! Just perfect right out of the box. Foot slid in with little resistance, heel locked in nicely, and toes can wiggle, I'm a happy camper. The full leather and cork insole/shank/midsole is stiff at first but it feels like it should have some give and mold to my foot properly. The chunky lug sole doesn't help with the stiffness but I'm loving how rugged they are. Definitely not a fashion boot sole. I'm also loving the tall logger heel, helps me feel balanced and stable in my step. The vamp around the forefoot is probably the snuggest part of the boot but I have a high instep so this not unusual for me. Overall I'm so psyched on my pair! Excited to put these to work!

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

I’m (25FtM) have been living with my partner A (25FtM) and his fiancée B (26MtF) for about 2 years consecutively now. i met them both as coworkers back in 2019, and me and A clicked almost immediately. We sat next to eachother at work, talked every day, and even hung out outside of work. 

B and I connected some. She was welcome over when A was, but he often came alone. He told me about some of their struggles and I helped talk him through them, as did he with my relationship at the time, you know as friends do. 

But after a bad breakup with an abusive ex in 2021, I ended up homeless. The only people I had to rely on were A and B, and they let me live with them for a while until I got back on my feet. That’s when I realized a big issue. They don’t know how to be adults. We all three have gone through significant amounts of trauma, and none of us had parents that taught us how to survive, much less take care of ourselves or anything else—but…god. When I stayed with them they were living with B’s mom (an addict and also borderline abusive), and they were sharing a room in a house that overall was DISGUSTING. B’s mom has multiple animals she never lets outside because she can’t take them herself, and every single thing in the house has at least 3 layers of shit and what have you caked into it. Piss has rotted the floors, and the smell…. it hits you from the driveway.  I tried so hard to help. I cleaned, I took the dogs out on walks for the first times in literal YEARS, groomed one of them on a couple occasions until i couldn’t handle doing all of it myself anymore. It was awful. 

Me and A got really close, and we talked about having a poly relationship. A and I would be having a more romantic relationship while B and I would be mostly physical, because that's how we all fit together the best, need-wise. But after a while, B backed out of being physical with me because she’s “only attracted to me sometimes” (whatever that means? still haven’t gotten an explanation for that). It hurt my feelings a bit of course, but I didn't want to break up with A so we kept things going. Physical touch and being lovey is my love language, so its been kind of difficult for me because A is a very *not* touchy person--which is where B would come along, but. Yeah.

After a couple of months, A got pregnant. After my previous relationship and losing my ex's kid after helping raise them, I was in a very emotionally torn place. I wanted a family so badly, and for medical reasons I can't have my own child, so when I was offered the chance to be in this one's life I jumped at the opportunity.  I will admit 100% I should have spent a much longer time thinking about everything and getting to know the both of them much better before making that decision, but alas, here we are. 

When the baby came, we'd moved into a new place because raising a child in B's mom's house would be a literal crime. Things had been great for a while, and then they quickly weren't. From the moment A gave birth, my instincts locked in and I did everything i possibly could to help him be comfortable and heal because the c-section was very stressful on him physically and mentally. B was working, and A was on medication that made him sleep very heavily, so I slept with the bassinet and got up every time the baby did to take care of her. I didn’t mind that much, but I was also waking up when A got up to help him with the baby during the day too, because the PPD and anxiety were extremely intense for him. But B didn’t really help even on her days off. I was still getting up with the baby, still changing and feeding and laying down for naps, etc. PLUS the chores around the house weren’t getting done because I was too exhausted to do them.

By the time the baby was 5 weeks old, I had a nervous breakdown and was admitted for psych hold, and even before doing that I had to plan everything out so that it was the weekend my mom wasn’t working and the baby would go to stay with her for the majority of the time I was gone.

When I got home, it was back to the same old thing. A was too anxious to lay the kid down for naps so I did. I got up with her at night (admittedly, with a few times that B would get her if I asked). But my feelings for the both of them has never really been the same.

I still love A so much, of course, he’s like my twin flame and I’d be destroyed if anything happened to him. But he didn't know how to sweep the floor before I showed him. He can't cook, and can't properly clean unless someone helps. With his mental illnesses, he really needs his own parent, or a caregiver or something that I just cannot be for him without losing myself.

With B, we’re friendly with each other, and I *do* have love for her, but after all of this time I really have so much resentment for her that it’s getting extremely hard to even hang out around the house with her. She can't seem to do anything on her own. On the rare occasion we ask her to change a shitty diaper she suddenly can't handle it and A or I have to finish the job. She asks A to make sure her clothes are clean for work, or her coffee stuff is ready so she can grab it and go in the morning, B even sits in the living room all day after work asking A to bring her a drink or food, and then when she goes to sleep she will ask A to bring her meds to her because 'she forgot'. Every night. 

The baby is 1.5yrs, and B has not changed enough diapers to equal at least one a WEEK of this kid's life. If we left them alone with B for an entire 24 hour period, I sincerely don’t know if she would remember to feed, change or even put the kid down for naps appropriately. 

The areas of the house that the kid has access to are clean and safe, but that limits them to their bedroom and living room. The kitchen always has dishes stacked and trash left out and messes that get ignored. There are baskets of backed up laundry, and the bathroom has clothes piled in there too. I’ve tried so hard asking for help, making plans, schedules for everybody, etc, and no one follows through.

It's gotten to the point that I sincerely just want to leave. I met a new friend that lives across the country, and I've seriously been looking into flights to go and visit, but a terrifyingly big part of me doesn't want to come back. I have no ties to the kid biologically or legally (even though I've asked for guardianship/custody rights but that takes money for lawyers/legal help that we don't have).  But I love them SO much and I feel like I would hate myself for abandoning them.

She cried more and said that she wanted to have a drink, cool down. She never returned to the office and was obviously bitching to the rest of the team about it, who were also cold to me and avoided me for the rest of the day.

1g4yndi,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1g4yndi/im_being_extorted/,I'm being extorted,"Missionaries love to share the story of Christ in America. When elders or sisters find someone willing to listen, they open the Book of Mormon and start reading 3 Nephi 11, wherein Jesus descends from heaven and preaches the gospel of deliverance. The message is inspiring. Yet missionaries skip the three previous chapters, which show another side of Jesus. Shortly after forgiving his crucifiers in Jerusalem, Jesus switches into attack mode and kills every man, woman, and child in 14 cities. Jesus drowns, crushes, and buries some of his victims. Others he carries away in whirlwinds. Then Jesus speaks from heaven and blames the dead. If people would keep his commandments, he would not have to hurt them (3 Nephi 10:3-7). This is the “agency of man,” as the church presents it: Obey or die. Vito Corleone, the fictional Godfather, uses similar tactics. “I’m gonna make him an offer he can't refuse,” Corleone says about one enemy. Then a henchman puts a severed horsehead in the man’s bed. Whether from a gangster or a god, behavior like this is extortion.

Joseph Smith flexed the same power in early church history. He claimed to speak for God, and promised curses for anyone who defied him (D&C 121:16). Some of these curses extended to the children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of Smith’s enemies (D&C 103:25). People who opposed Smith in Missouri received a permanent priesthood ban for themselves and their posterity “from generation to generation” (D&C 121:21). Smith also threatened the saints. If they failed to pay tithing, Smith said Jesus would burn them (D&C 64:23). Smith also commanded the saints to give him food, clothing, money, “and whatsoever thing he needeth” (D&C 24:3-6, D&C 43:13). The saints also had to build a house for Smith (D&C 41:7; D&C 94:3), then a bigger house (D&C 124:23, 56, 59-60), and transfer all their property to the church for redistribution—after Smith and his friends took a cut for themselves, so they could “enter into the joy” of the church’s wealth as “a manifestation of (God’s) blessings upon their heads” (D&C 70:15-18; D&C 104:84-86). Smith also used coercive tactics to obtain wives as young as 14. Some of these wives were already married to other men; some were mother-daughter pairs; and some were foster children or domestic helpers in Smith’s care. Anything Smith commanded came with a built-in threat. Jesus said he would curse anyone who “shall lift up the heel” against Smith (D&C 121:16). This is not idle talk. The Book of Mormon makes clear that Jesus is capable of retribution.

The extortion continues in the church today. Leaders warn that people who fail to “stay in the boat and hold on” can lose promised blessings. Even minor disobedience can lead to disaster. Julie Beck, former first counselor in the Young Women General Presidency, tells the story of a good woman who lost nine of her 10 children to Satan because she drank coffee. “\[B\]ecause of that little cup of coffee, she could not qualify for a temple recommend, and neither could those of her children who drank coffee with her.” Church messaging has softened since then. Apostles talk more frequently about grace and mercy. But the underlying threat remains in force: If you disobey Jesus, he will destroy you. He has carried out holocausts in the past and has promised even greater atrocities when he returns. Ignore him at your peril.",12,1729083208.0,exmormon,5,1.0,False

For most of the past year, I have been carrying an unhealthy weight, mainly due to emotional eating while stressing about my finances. It reached a point where I began experiencing cramps during my periods for the first time in my life. I was also dealing with anxiety and depression.

(I’m turning 43 in December. I’ve had an active lifestyle since childhood, but when it comes to nutrition, there have been periods in my life where I’ve been unhealthy. However, I never had problems with period pains until recently.)

Two months ago, I decided to stop my unhealthy eating habits (cold turkey):

1. I stopped drinking coffee and milk (but not yogurt) and cut out pork and beef (though I still eat chicken and fish occasionally).
2. I drastically reduced my carbohydrate intake (mostly breads) and processed foods.
3. I made sure to include greens and vegetables in every meal, ensuring they cover 50% of my (now smaller) plate.
4. I bless my food at every meal.
5. I eat only when I'm hungry (meaning my stomach acids are ready) and stop eating as soon as I feel satiated (around 80% full).
6. I try to follow the pattern of eating fibers first and sweets last.

(For context, I don’t drink alcohol (not even wine), I exercise regularly, and I go to bed early and wake up early.)

About a month into my healthy eating pattern, I started bleeding lightly non-stop for 1.5 months, with blood clots on some days. This was followed by heavy bleeding for two full days with very uncomfortable cramping. Then, exactly 28 days later (this week!), I am bleeding WITHOUT PAIN, although I’m still passing some blood clots.

As for my mental health, I am no longer anxious or depressed. In fact, my youthful energy is back, and for the first time in a long time, I feel confident that all my goals and aspirations can come true. 

And, I am back to my old weight.

I am still eating the same (healthy) way as of this writing, and I intend to continue for the rest of my life. <3",0,1729083025.0,Periods,4,0.33,False
1g4yl7f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g4yl7f,Chilly This Morning,"It was a brisk 39° this morning.  I went out on my morning walk into the field while the coffee made itself.  Pour a cup, add my whip, each dog lines up for whip and they all get mouthfuls. The morning feels great and a bit refreshing.  

Don't forget to stop and enjoy the outside, even if you are just briefly out. If it is raining, pause and look if you are under a cover.  It really is amazing just listening to the world.  No headphones, no music, no ear buds.  Listen to your environment. Right now for me I hear my dog snoring, the slight buzz of the fridge and the soft tap of my fingers as I type this and the sound of my breathing if I listen through the layers and go softer and softer.  Often times this works as a grounding tool if you feel stressed, anxiety or panic attack.  You can do this anywhere. 

As always, I like you, even if I do not know you.  You have value and worth simply by being a human, nothing more needed than that.  I am glad you are here today, even if it was a struggle.  Go forth and be kind to yourselves.

We have a 5 month old puppy and was curious on when you guys got your pup to sleep through the night 😅 or even any tips on your night time routine? 

The days we are in office he is left alone for 4/5 hours, let out for lunch, then sleeps the rest 4/5 hours without any issues (I’m constantly checking out blink camera to make sure he’s ok lol)

About a month ago we had a 2 week span of him consistently sleeping through the night and now it seems like we’ve had some major regression because he wakes up 4-5 times through the night now with constant whining and banging at his crate. 

We’ve tried to let him cry it out but we just feel bad because when we do let him out, he goes potty every time. 

Also we do cut off food and water around 7 and we put him to bed at 8:45. I also think he could be a little stinker because he loves his morning routine so much (my husband gets up with him at 5:30/6 and snuggles with him on the couch while i drink my coffee and enjoy my morning lol).

Now, l'm reverse dieting and lean bulking, maintaining a consistent 2600 calories as a vegetarian, with zero cheat meals in the past 10 months. Moving to the States next year for further studies and planning to compete naturally-just proof that hard work, even on a vegan diet, pays off. The only supplement I've used throughout this journey is whey protein which I later switched for a plant based one, and as a black coffee lover, that's the only other boost l've needed. My diet has remained unchanged-no fancy tricks or exotic foods-just consistency. During the fat loss phase, l committed to a high level of cardio to maximize results. Now, as I focus on reverse dieting and lean bulking, I keep my activity level steady with 10,000 steps a day. It's all about balance, staying consistent, and finding what works best for you.

I am 34M, 6’1” and 210lbs

Smoker for 10 years and daily drinker for same duration. Quit smoking 3 years ago. 

For the last two months I have been experiencing a very odd symptom, which is that when I belch (on some days, but not others) I get a distinct dull ache behind my sternum on the rebound portion of the burp. This is sometimes accompanied by slight discomfort in the same area throughout the day, but is never severe and comes and goes.

The symptoms started in conjunction with a SEVERE sore throat after a night of drinking and smoking, both of which I had more or less quit but this was a reunion with old friends. The sore throat passed but this continues. I assumed that they were related as they were so close together, but I suppose it could have been a coincidence. I went to a minute clinic and tested negative for everything so we never sorted out the sore throat, it just passed.

It seems like avoiding acidic foods, carbonated beverages, and coffee may help but it’s very inconsistent. Some days I will be fine all day then have a painful belch and be fine again.

Currently switching back to the VA health system and plan to see an MD, but since a post op infection a couple years ago I have started overthinking my health and don’t want to keep wasting people’s time

here’s the kicker: i know my friends think I’m cute. well i mean, i’ve got that dark, edgy style going on, and a personality to match. but when it comes to getting noticed by guys? it’s like im wearing an invisibility cloak or something? idk.

well, just the other day, i thought I’d finally caught the eye of a handsome dude at a coffee shop. he kept glancing my way while I was trying to enjoy my mocha, and i thought, this is it! he’s totally going to come over and say something witty. i gave him my best mysterious smile as a catholic girrl (you know, the kind that says o might be a little trouble, but in a fun way).

but nope! He just picked up his drink and left without a word.. off to charm some other unsuspecting woman, i guess. i felt like a total dork, standing there holding my cup like a prop in some tragic rom com.

I genuinely like him and like them for each other.

She probably has some kind of feelings too for me though based on a lot of reasons.

After the wedding, which I was invited to, I spiraled a few days unrelated to her. A lot of personal shit and our job is honestly the worst job I ever worked at, so a few days I was just sad. Not manic or anything, sad. Panicky too. I felt sick with worry, family member is very ill and might pass away. She didn't know abt the family member but knew I was down, supported a few days, but then on a dime just stopped talking to me. She snapped at me. Called me a little bitch. We worked in a heavy mindset job and I was being a burden kind of thing. I actually agree with that a lot, I told her I was sorry for it after a week and that I wouldn't do it anymore.

She used that to decide she didnt want to speak to me anymore. So she stopped speaking to me for 6 full weeks, noticeably so to everyone else around. Didn't give me any reason at first just became cold. Like even arching her back away from me so as to not look at me. Hurt me badly. treated me extremely poorly not long after the wedding and made it seem like I'm this distraction. She started a lot of our discussions at owrk, the texts, the going out to get coffee together. Then blames me!!!

She finds out I'm leaving the job a couple days before I do, talks to me again, makes it seem like she did me a favor.

She fucking hurt me. I was ready to never speak to her again. But the fact that she did this and started talking to me again, trying to make amends, laughing like we used to...this has made my dormant attraction to her come back stronger than before. Because you ahve to be either nuts or really struggling with feelings for someone to go to the lengths she did not to speak to me. We sit right side by side. We talked a ton, then she wouldn't even breathe in my direction. It was so fucking hard. Many ppl noticed.

I'm still into her now despite her cruelty.

Between us, we have kind of a professional relationship, not really anything personal. We both are teachers and we teach similar subjects.

Uluwatu Temple-aggressive ang mga unggoy nang aagaw ng salamin/anything red. Di daw kasi pinapakain. Maganda view pero di mo maeenjoy masyado kung dahil sa unggoy. 


Ganesha Cafe- La Union vibes. Di masarap literal na boiled/grilled lang walang spices yung luto. 17% service charge.

2 spots for picture taking. Pwede ka lumabas at magphotoshoot dun sa mga swing for IDR 200K kasama long dress. Wala nang tao pag patanghali o baka natyempuhan lang namin. Sobrang foggy pag sobrang aga mas okay pag mga 10am onwards. Walang ibang activities bukod sa pagpicture. Bawa pumasok pag may regla at mandatory ang sarong pero libre naman bago ka pumasok. 

Tirta Gangga-Ang lalaki ng mga isda. Isang libutan lang. Separate fee yung fish food. 

Silver Shop-Overpriced mas mura sa PH. Nasa IDR 7M /P25k presyo ng silver at gold. Meron ding mas mura pero per piece sila di per gram. 

Tegal Sari Luwak Coffee Plantation-Isang libutan lang din may mga nakadisplay na end products kada process. May free taste ng mga kape. Recommended yung vanilla at lemon grass flavor. IDR 150K (P500+) yung kape for 500g. 


Jungle Gold Chocolate-Nasa IDR 200K (P272+) mga chocolates. Cafe din ito. May mga free taste. 

Batik Factory-IDR 140K yung tshirt tapos donation lang sa painting kung anong gusto mo ilagay. 


Nusa Penida-30 mins to Sanur Port. Nasa P500 one way. Until 5pm lang byahe. Kaya libutin in a day pero limited lang kayang gawin. Recommended umalis before 5 dahil malakas alon. 


Angel Billabong  and Broken Beach-1.5 hrs galing port. Iisang area lang to. Super crowded. Maraming bilihan ng pagkain. Malakas alon.

 
Kelingking Beach-Crowded sa taas. Sobrang tarik ng hagdan 1hr trekking din pababa depende kung gano ka kabilis. Pwede magswimming. May elevator na under construction. 
May IDR 75K (P275+) bayad if magpapapic dun sa isang spot. 

Diamond Beach/Treehouse-Around 2 hrs from Kelingking. Pwede din bumaba pero opted sa taas lang magpic dahil sobrang init at time consuming mag trekking. Ibang entrance yung papuntang treehouse na may trekking din at around 1 hr na pila sa pagpic. May IDR 75K na bayad din. 


Bubu Beach-Puerto Galera vibes. Malakas alon pero pwede magchill sa resto kung ayaw mag swimming. May 15% service charge. 

-

Kaya ang Budget Travel. You can spend P35k all in or even under. Okay sya for me mavisit at least once pero sa ngayon di na muna babalikan. The prices are like Bohol's and the service charge and govt tax are insane (ranges fr 3-17%).
Card payment is accepted at major locations but most are still cash based. Some places charge a 3% charge if you use your card whether debit/credit. 


The public restrooms are clean and well maintained. They charge IDR 5-10K (P20-40). May bidet at malakas water pressure. Kaso may amoy ang tap water. 


Tourist Spots-Sobrang layo sa isa't-isa aabutin ka ng 30-1.5hrs pagitan. Tapos nasa 2-3 hrs din layo from hotel. Masikip daan nila kalahati lang ng daan natin. Same traffic as PH. I'd recommend to hire a local guide since karamihan is bundok talaga and I can't see any public transpo. Grab is working naman kaya lang may mga places na very hard to reach baka mahirapan kayo bumalik. Local guides are friendly and charge reasonably naman you just have to tip them. Karamihan din ng tourist spots ay for pics lang walang ibang activities na pwedeng gawin so kung di ka mahilig magpicture ang other option ay maglakad lakad. 


Beaches-I prefer our own. Sobrang lakas at taas ng mga alon kaya kang tangayin pabalik ng Pinas. Mabato rin. Kung sa Pinas ang mga beach ay may bundok, sa Nusa Penida bundok na may beach kaya wala kang choice kundi magtrek kung gusto mo maligo. But the views are magnificent as in ang ganda ng kulay.


Locals-super friendly and a lot of them can speak Filipino. Madaling makahingi ng discount.

I started to brew beer. So you can help me with it. Or atleast tell me it taste bad and get me to improve it. Still playing that Overwatch, used to play in some tournies and such things.

What I'm looking for

I'm looking for someone who wants to do stuff with me. And vice versa, it's a two way road. But basically still able to go out and enjoy your time. A girl that also plays Overwatch, it's more of a plus lol. Or dare I say, play D&D with me. We can be the best D&D couple lmao

This is Akash, the founder of [Hopinio.com](https://hopinio.com), and I’d like to welcome you to r/hopinio – a dedicated space for discussing, sharing, and discovering legit Instagram sellers, helping everyone stay away from scammers and dupes.

More about Akash [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akash-dhina/) and [twitter](https://x.com/akkash_me)

# What is Hopinio?

Hopinio is a platform designed to help shoppers make smarter decisions when shopping on Instagram. We gather reviews, provide trust scores, and offer tools to verify Instagram sellers before you make a purchase. Whether you're a buyer looking for trustworthy sellers or a seller wanting to build your brand’s reputation, Hopinio is here to bridge the gap and build trust in Instagram shopping.

# Why We Built Hopinio

Personally, I’ve been duped by Instagram sellers, and many of my friends and family have also been scammed. We built this site for ourselves and the community to evaluate Instagram sellers.

According to a reputed news journal, social commerce is set to reach a $55 billion market in India alone by 2030. \[[Source](https://www.business-standard.com/amp/industry/news/social-commerce-set-for-growth-concern-of-authenticity-looms-large-124040700339_1.html)\]. This is great news for legit sellers but unfortunately, it also means more opportunity for scammers.

# Why We Care About Reviews

You might wonder why we’ve built a review site for Instagram stores. The truth is, Meta (Instagram) doesn’t seem to care about scams and dupes – they’re focused on other issues. Plus, they earn a lot of ad revenue from sellers, both legit and scams, and authenticity isn’t their priority.

# Is Hopinio For Profit?

Nope! I’m a developer and entrepreneur at heart. I’ve built a lot of apps and Chrome extensions just for fun, and Hopinio is something we built for the community to help protect people from scammers. Right now, we’re burning around ₹10,000 per month to keep the servers running and pay for the AI agent APIs. To keep Hopinio alive, we’re planning to introduce ads and a \*\*Buy Me a Coffee\*\* option.

# What Can You Do Here?

* **Share your experiences**: Bought something from an Instagram seller? Let us know how it went! Feel free to paste your Hopinio review link here.
* **Ask questions**: Need advice on a specific seller or tips on safe buying? This is the place!
* **Get updates on Hopinio**: We’ll post updates on new features, tips for sellers, and how buyers can get the most out of Hopinio. If you need a feature, feel free to DM me – we’ll do our best to ship it as soon as possible.
* **Connect with other buyers and sellers**: Engage with fellow community members who share an interest in safe Instagram shopping.

# Community Rules

To keep this community friendly and helpful:

1. Be respectful and kind to all members.
2. No spam or self-promotion without context.

1g4y1lr,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1g4y1lr/insomnia_takes_me_to_the_brink/,Insomnia takes me to the brink,"I have struggled with insomnia for a long time. For quite some time I managed by taking Trazodone, but the medication is terrible for me. It makes me sleepy, unfocused, forgetful, and I feel like a real live zombie. I gave it up last year and managed to get a reasonable amount of sleep for a few months, but then a family tragedy hit, I lost my father and I completely lost my sleep pattern again. Since then, I have been dragging myself to work and back, trying my best not to screw it all up.

So, like any insomniac, I feared more than ever that my health was deteriorating... and it was.

I was addicted to coffee, I tried to make up for the time lost in the morning by prolonging my evenings, and it got worse and worse. Late night phone calls and death scrolling probably made it worse. I tried to make myself feel good by buying a lot of things or use other stimulation. Nothing changed. I actually hate myself. This isn't me anymore. My mood is terrible. Even my relationship doesn't make me happy anymore, it's total darkness at the moment.

My biggest fear is that my mental decline is so bad that it will fuck up my future career (yes I know about the bad that comes from insomnia).

The insomnia also changed my appearance. I look pale and sickly with thick dark rings around my eyes. I really lose my self-confidence.

I have now joined a MBSR (meditation programme) and during the course I will try to undo a lot of the negative habits I have picked up over the years.

Since this weekend I reduced caffeine to zero, I think it was making me struggle even more with sleep. (Tea is also off the table for now) This will probably be the hardest thing as it kept me going on really bad days, but I feel like it perpetuated the cycle of insomnia.

I really try everything, but somehow it seems like insomnia is slowly destroying me.",1,1729081308.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

It would be really nice to get to know more people in the local trans community, whether you’re early in your transition or further along. I’m pretty easygoing and love a good chat about anything, from trans topics to tech (I work in software), movies, or just life in general.

1g4xws7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1g4xws7/the_ultimate_guide_to_designing_an_outdoor_living/,The Ultimate Guide to Designing an Outdoor Living Room,"An outdoor living room is the perfect way to extend your home's living space into the open air, creating a comfortable and stylish area to relax, entertain, and enjoy nature. With thoughtful design choices, you can transform your patio, deck, or garden into an outdoor oasis that feels as cozy and functional as any indoor room. In this guide, we'll walk you through the essential elements of designing the ultimate outdoor living room, incorporating must-have pieces like [bar carts](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/bar-carts), [rattan benches](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/rattan-benches), and [hanging chairs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/hanging-chairs) to elevate your space.

**1. Start with the Layout**

The first step in designing an outdoor living room is planning the layout. Consider the size of your space and how you want to use it. Do you envision a cozy seating area for intimate gatherings or a larger space for entertaining guests? Identify zones for different activities, such as lounging, dining, or serving drinks. A well-thought-out layout ensures your space flows seamlessly and maximizes functionality.

**2. Comfortable Seating Options**

Seating is a key component of any outdoor living room. To create a space where people can unwind, opt for a mix of seating types that cater to different needs:

**Rattan benches:** These versatile pieces provide ample seating while adding texture and warmth to your space. Rattan's natural look blends effortlessly with outdoor environments, and its durability makes it ideal for year-round use.

**Hanging chairs:** Perfect for adding a touch of whimsy and comfort, hanging chairs create a cozy spot to lounge and enjoy the breeze. They’re also great for creating a relaxed, boho vibe.

Lounge chairs, sofas, and poufs can complete the seating arrangement, ensuring there’s a comfortable place for everyone.

**3. Create Ambiance with Lighting**

Lighting is crucial for setting the mood in your outdoor living room. Soft, ambient lighting creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, perfect for evening relaxation or hosting guests. Consider using:

String lights for a magical, starry-night effect.

Lanterns or pendant lights for a more formal and structured look.

Solar-powered lights to enhance eco-friendliness.

Position lighting strategically to illuminate key areas, such as seating zones and walkways, without overpowering the natural beauty of the outdoors.

**4. Add Functional Style with Bar Carts**

A bar cart is a stylish and practical addition to your outdoor living room. It serves as a convenient spot to mix and serve drinks while keeping everything you need within arm’s reach. Opt for a bar cart with wheels for easy mobility, allowing you to move it around depending on your event’s needs. Stock it with glassware, a few cocktail essentials, and perhaps even some snacks to keep your guests refreshed during those long summer afternoons.

**5. Outdoor Rugs and Textiles**

To make your outdoor living room feel more like a traditional indoor space, consider adding an outdoor rug. This will not only anchor your seating area but also add warmth and texture underfoot. Choose a durable, weather-resistant material that can handle the elements without sacrificing style.

Incorporate cushions, throws, and pillows in outdoor-friendly fabrics to enhance comfort and give your seating a cozy, plush look. Mix and match colors and patterns to reflect your personal style, whether it's bright and bold or more neutral and serene.

**6. Decor and Accessories**

Personalize your outdoor living room with decor that enhances its charm and functionality. Potted plants, ceramic vases, and outdoor artwork can bring color and life to your space. Consider using rattan baskets to store extra cushions or blankets, and add small side tables or stools for extra convenience.

Don't forget to layer in accessories that provide both form and function. Use weather-resistant trays on your bar cart for serving drinks or snacks, and place outdoor candle holders on tables for added ambiance in the evening.

**7. Weather-Proofing and Durability**

When choosing furniture and accessories for your outdoor living room, it’s essential to select weather-resistant materials. Opt for furniture made from materials like teak, metal, or all-weather wicker. Items like rattan benches and hanging chairs should be treated or designed for outdoor use to ensure they last through different weather conditions.

Also, consider investing in protective covers for your furniture and textiles to keep them looking fresh for years to come.

**8. Incorporate Natural Elements**

Bringing in natural elements like wood, stone, and greenery can help blend your outdoor living room with its surroundings. Potted plants, hanging planters, or a vertical garden can make the space feel lush and inviting. You can also introduce natural textures through your furniture choices, like rattan benches or a wooden coffee table.

**Conclusion**

Designing the ultimate outdoor living room is all about creating a space that balances comfort, style, and functionality. With the right layout, seating, lighting, and decor, you can transform any outdoor area into a stylish retreat perfect for lounging, entertaining, or dining. By incorporating essential pieces like bar carts, rattan benches, and hanging chairs, you'll have a space that's not only beautiful but also practical and versatile for enjoying the great outdoors year-round.",1,1729080867.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to have a discussion about something I’ve experienced recently. I’ve had chronic migraines for 15 years, starting when I was 9. They have changed over the years, but recently, after giving birth to my daughter, they have seemingly disappeared!

I’m just curious if anyone else has had this experience? 

I had come to terms with the fact that I would always have migraines, I even had some of the worst migraines of my life while I was pregnant (I drank a pepsi one day, big mistake, and half of my body went numb when previously the most that would go numb was my one hand and half my face, not to mention the other symptoms of aura, nausea etc). 

I gave birth 7 months ago, and I haven’t had so much as a bad headache since, let alone a migraine.

They were fairly under control before I got pregnant since I was getting botox every 12 weeks for the past 5ish years, but caffeine and strong perfumes/smells were still major triggers for me.

Now, I drink coffee daily, no migraines, no headaches, nothing. I hadn’t drank coffee in 10 years!

Has anyone else been cured of migraines by giving birth? Genuinely curious if I am just extremely lucky or if this is “normal”

edit: i forgot to mention, i also haven’t gotten botox in over a year (stopped when i got pregnant and haven’t started again) so i am doing nothing for prevention, they’ve just gone away on their own ",17,1729080716.0,migraine,22,1.0,False

I have never had any issues until this morning and someone said “it’s policy” that they are not allowed, at the same store that they just allowed it for weeks at. They also charged me extra for it today which has not happened any other time.
