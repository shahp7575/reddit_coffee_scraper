1q8fw8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bolehland/comments/1q8fw8y/follow_up/,Follow up...,"Hello, it's me, the introvert who ran away from home.

-6th January-
I arrived at KL the night after I uploaded my last post on Jan 6. Around 10 hours ride to KL. I rode my bike and spotted merdeka tower and twin tower from afar and got excited. It's my first time in a really long while since I came to KL after all, and by myself at that. A huge achievement for an introvert like me.

I then rode and parked my bike just near the skate park. I walk around a little and saw a glorious twin tower face to face at night. I was mesmerized for a moment and then realized I'm alone at this place. I took a picture of it, but there is no one to share with. 

I continue walking and saw a lot of job ads for F&B. I took interest in it after reading so many of you bolehlanders advised me to take a job. But it was already night and I was tired, so I rode my bike to find a place to sleep.

But before that, I went to find a gas station by using Google maps... and daym, the road here is confusing af. Even gps can't help me. So many turn here and there, and then I somehow ended up at KLCC parking lot LMAO.

Anyway, after I turn back and gassed up my bike, I went to find a place to sleep. First thing I thought was finding surau or masjid, but when I saw that surau was closed that night, I give up on searching another one and went to sungai buloh R&R because there is surau and shower room. 

-7th January-
Next day, 7th Jan, I went back to the place I was yesterday night. I walked inside one of the coffee store and order one of their coffee, the cheapest one. I pretended to look around but my eyes stuck on their job ads. ""Oh, do you still hiring?"" I asked casually as the cashier processing the money. He gave me his manager's contact number and I called the number after I finished drink the coffee.

And so I will have interview on the next day. Job secured, I thought. Now, to find a permanent place to sleep. I googled ibilik and speedhome to find room to rent. I was struggling. I try to search the cheapest one but it was tough. Found the cheapest room, but Its shared bedroom. Found another one, but it's really small and compact. I search for hours and so on but can't find anything that I really wanted. So, I went back to Sungai Buloh R&R to sleep for another night.

-8th January-
The next day, 8th Jan, interview time! But before that, I take a look at my phone and saw an email sent to me, it was my sister's. (I removed my old sim card so that I can cut all contact with everyone. That's why she sent me an email since I didn't change my Gmail account.) She expressed sadness and heartful feeling in the email, she apologizes... even though she did nothing wrong. In fact, She's the best person I've ever had. She took care of me while I was unemployed. And to hear her apologized to me like that, it hits me really bad. She also stated that my mother was crying when she heard the news, how my mom crying while she was eating. To hear her own son leaving her like that... I was really regretful and guilty for leaving them without saying anything. I wrote an email back to my sister and apologize for everything I've done. I told her everything about why I left, the shameful decision and all that. I cried while typing the email. I really want to go back home, but I'm already gone this far, so I can't just give up like that. 

The interview was simple and went pretty well. The interviewer asked me to take a typhoid injection at nearby clinic. So I went to the clinic right after the interview and met a kind middle aged woman at a counter, a clinic staff. After I did an injection, I asked the kind middle aged woman about me being kinda homeless, and she's caring enough to guide and help me finding a room. But then, another staff came, a younger one this time. The middle aged woman spoke to that staff about me, a lady named Awien, I called her Kak Awien. She still looks young but daym, she the kindest stranger I've ever met. We exchanged contact and she eagerly and willingly helped me find a room while we chatted on WhatsApp. She spent hours just to recommend me a room that's affordable within my budget... Until she found the room I really wants. But it's already late at night, and I'm tired. So I went back to Sungai Buloh R&R to sleep. 

-9th January-
9th Jan, I woke up and checked my phone's notification. My sister responded to my email. She wrote that she truly understood how I felt and how she's been having a same thing happened to her and all that. She still expressed the sadness but with an understanding this time. I didn't reply back because I don't know what to say. I'm having all that guilt but I don't know how to tell about it to her.

So about the room, it's a medium sized room for single person in condominium. Rm 300/month plus 2 months deposit. I messaged the agent and told him that I'm interested. I come over to look at the place and I instantly hooked at the condonium. It's 30 storey tall. A pool and gym facilities included. Strict security, which is really good. I have less to worry about my bike being stolen and such. And then the room itself, it's okay, nothing fancy, but it's really good for the price that was offered. So I didn't hesitate to take a deal with the agent. 

Now I got a key, my own room to sleep. I then checked my phone and saw an email. an offer letter was sent to me by the company I'd interview yesterday. I was accepted to be part of their employee!

So many good thing happened today, so I contact my sister through WhatsApp to share the news. (I contact her using a new sim card. I tried to surprised her by being salesman, but my plan failed because I forgot to change my WhatsApp's username). I told her I got a job and a place to stay here in KL. She was really happy and excited to hear me doing well. She told me she and my mother will come here to KL tomorrow just to see me. My mother also excited and eagerly packing my stuff that I will need to survive here (she knew I didn't bring a lot with me). 

I still feels bad for everything I've done. My family is a normal loving family. But I'm the one who is troubled, spoiled kid. But i guess it kinda left in happy story for now. I got a job and a room. I got in contact back with my family. All in well, I hope. 

Thank you for reading. I know I bore you all bolehlander for this long ass post. I just wanted to update on whats going on with my life. And hopefully can be lesson to you as well. Wish me luck guys!

Oh btw, Kak Awien is the GOAT! I don't think I really shows her much appreciation in the post above. She truly treated me like her own little brother. Called me 'adik' while being a kindly older sister. And I too treat her like a sister. I mean, she literally asked me to treat her like a real sister. She would never forget to remind me to be careful around people and to take better care of my stuff, especially here in KL. I'm truly lucky to encounter her. My first ever friend in KL that I would regard as a family. Thank you GoatWien <3.",1,1767982730.0,Bolehland,0,1.0,False
1q8fw8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Leather-Buddy-7902/comments/1q8fw8t/my_cursed_socks_and_the_weird_psychology_behind/,My 'Cursed' Socks and the Weird Psychology Behind Them,"Okay, so I have this pair of bright green, slightly mismatched socks. They're super comfy, but for the longest time, I legitimately swore they were cursed. Seriously. Every single time I wore them, something mildly annoying but undeniably *bad* would happen. Spill coffee all over my clean shirt? Green socks. Stub my toe on the furniture? Green socks. Get a passive-aggressive email from work that just ruins my mood? You guessed it, green socks.

It wasn't like anything catastrophic or life-altering, just a string of enough small, frustrating annoyances to make me genuinely believe these socks were a magnet for minor disasters. I even started strategically avoiding them, burying them deep at the bottom of my laundry pile, sometimes whispering dramatic things like, ""Not today, Satan socks!"" My friends thought it was absolutely hilarious, but deep down, a part of me was genuinely convinced about their dark powers.

Then, one day, I was casually reading an article about cognitive biases – specifically 'illusory correlation' and 'confirmation bias.' And it hit me like a ton of bricks, a real 'aha!' moment. My brain wasn't actually recording *all* the days I wore the green socks and absolutely nothing bad happened. Instead, it was only latching onto and remembering with vivid clarity the times when something went wrong *while* I was wearing them. All the neutral or good days just faded into the background, completely ignored.

It was such a mind-bending realization. My brain was actively constructing a pattern that wasn't really there, just because it loved the idea of a simple cause and effect, even if that cause was just a pair of silly, harmless socks. I felt this weird mix of foolishness for believing in 'cursed' socks and profound fascination with how easily our minds can play such convincing tricks on us.

Now, I still wear the green socks occasionally. And sometimes, yep, something annoying still happens. But instead of cursing the fabric, I just chuckle to myself and remember how our brains are wired to connect dots, even when those dots are miles apart and completely unrelated. It’s been a weirdly humbling and fascinating lesson in how we perceive the world around us.

Have you ever noticed your brain playing similar tricks on you? What seemingly random 'curses' or 'blessings' have you convinced yourself of, only to realize it might just be your psychology at play?",1,1767982730.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

I can really understand that, and also that she wants to do it on her own, without being influenced by a heterosexual relationship.

For the first three weeks after the breakup, we still had casual contact because I was happy to hear from her, but I found it inappropriate that she sometimes talked to me about her crush in such a euphoric way. I signaled too late that I didn't want to hear about it.

Yesterday we met for coffee, and it was very emotional. However, I saw her with her crush that evening. That brought me back to reality. Overnight, she wrote to me that she misses me. We spoke briefly on the phone because I realized that I can't have any contact with her. Phrases like “I miss you” give me hope, which is then dashed. She told me that she no longer believes her crush reciprocates her feelings. And I just said that I'm really not the one she should be telling this to.



I don't know what she's hoping for. I understand that I'm a very trustworthy person, but I find her behavior strange.

In the past I've [shared a coffee table](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mid_Century/comments/1k1ge4s/my_john_keal_for_brown_saltman_coffee_table_build/), a lamp, and some chairs that I've made for my home, all based on well known Mid Century/California Modernist designs. I'm leaning towards a side table to match my other furniture for this next project and I'm thinking that the John Keal for Brown Saltman magazine wedge table is a good candidate.

I've drafted up two models based on the original design. Option A is based on the original geometry which has the legs square to the table top. Option B takes some liberties with the geometry of the front legs and the front of the magazine rack in a way that I think will compliment the other pieces I've built (pics 5-7 w/ cat tax). Of course it could turn out that som 89 degree angles is the contrast i need.

The model is all hard edges but I'll probably introduce a round edge profile to the final piece that is more in keeping with the original design - it was just too much for me and my beginner CAD skills to model in the couple of hours I had to put these together.

1q8fstc,https://i.redd.it/8jrkojro7dcg1.png,Working Remotely with Data Annotation – My Honest Experience After Earning $20K,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to share my experience working with Data Annotation Tech (DA) since I’ve noticed more people are curious about legit WFH options. I’ve been using the platform for about a year and a half now, and it’s helped me make over $20,000 whilst finishing up my degree here in the UK.

DA is similar to other data labelling platforms since you evaluate AI models, write prompts, give feedback, and work on a bunch of different projects. Some are creative, some technical, and some just need your honest opinion. I’ve worked on projects related to bilingual content, finance, business, safety, accuracy, and even a few STEM ones. Some require experience, but many are accessible even if you don’t have a formal background in the topic.

The best part about this job has been working from home or wherever I’ve got WiFi and coffee. The platform has become my main income source since graduating, and I’m now at full-time earnings with some other stuff on the side, completely remote. Payouts take about a week to verify, but you can withdraw every three days. Work volume can vary, but if you’re consistent and qualify for different project types, there’s real potential here. You do sign an NDA, so I can’t go into detail on the specific companies I’ve worked with, but they’re the biggest companies, especially in the AI field. Like any freelance or remote gig, there can be dry spells. However, this is the best remote platform I have worked for, and I have consistently been able to work. Whether a student, a recent grad, or just looking for more flexibility, this has been a game-changer for me.

I’ve also set up a Discord community (2K+ members) for anyone who wants to get into remote work, learn how to qualify for projects, share progress, and stay motivated.

1q8fspn,https://i.redd.it/tnybquaq7dcg1.jpeg,question - boos ridiculous brownies,"hey! ik quite a few people have posted about this so I thought I’d leave my questions here if that’s ok!

I’m not great at baking so I’d appreciate any tips / thoughts - please just assume ik nothing 😅 basically it’s my best friend’s birthday soon and i’d like to bake the brownies as a healthier / lower calorie / higher protein birthday cake. the thing is my friend can’t have dairy (at least not semi-skimmed / skimmed / whey protein). ik in the original recipe, it says whey protein works better than others so i’m a little worried. I was thinking of adding these (I’m from the uk and found these at holland & barrett): https://formnutrition.com/plant-based-nutrition/form-performance-plant-based-vegan-protein-powder/
the thing is its pea / brown rice / pumpkin seed protein so I’m not sure how well it’ll work. 
if not, I’ve got these japanese savas soy protein at home:  https://www.meiji.co.jp/sports/savas/english/ - I think I’ve got them in both chocolate and coffee flavours. otherwise, I’ve also got pb2 / other branded peanut butter powder in original and chocolate flavours. which one do you guys think would work best? I’m pretty happy with either plain chocolate / pb / coffee flavours

the other thing is ik the recipe calls for different dried ingredients, including flour, cocoa powder and the protein powder. ik whatever’s on the original recipe is probably the best ratio haha but since loads of people have experimented with alternatives, I’m curious to see whether anyone has any thoughts on different ratios or using other products? I’m happy to use any of the protein / pb powder mentioned above in different combinations, but also have normal cocoa powder, plain flour, japanese dried okara powder (soy pulp), lupin flour, japanese kinako (soy) powder etc. I guess the macros will be different and if my understanding is correct, they serve different functions when baking, so it might not work to substitute (or at least do a 1:1 swap) for some of them so just thought to see if anyone has tried anything that worked for them! I’m also aware other products like oat fibre, xanthan gum etc exist and would be happy to purchase them if they’ve proven to work 😅 it’s just that all these niche ingredients are kind of expensive so I’d rather not splurge on them if people have tried them and they work significantly worse than eg normal flour or what I already have at home. 

one last question would be on the colour and the texture - a lot of pics I’ve seen online from people sharing their boos ridiculous brownies look quite dark and flat? at least darker than store bought brownies. does this affect the taste at all? I’m once again not a baking expert so am just curious as to why this is the case.

while I’d love to keep it as low cal / high protein as possible, I’m hoping to get a good balance between macros and taste - it would be a shame if the brownie turned out great in terms of macros but have a massive compromise in taste as it’s a birthday cake / treat after all haha! ik the recipe skips out on common ingredients that up the total calories eg butter, milk, eggs etc - but has anyone tried whether it makes a massive improvement in taste if just a tiny bit of any of the above are added? I’m thinking I’d at least add a bit of choc chips or crush up an oreo or two to add some texture and make it so that it’s closer to a normal “unhealthier” brownie but would appreciate any thoughts on how to improve taste without massively increasing the calories!

thank you all soo much for your help! I’ll link / attach a pic of the original recipe ☺️

1q8fqtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1q8fqtx/is_it_being_reasonable_or_just_my_hormones_risk/,Is it being reasonable or just my hormones? (Risk of catching a virus before my planned C-section and finances),"TL;DR: I’m 37.5 weeks pregnant with a scheduled C-section in 10 days. I’ve handled and paid for almost all baby prep, while my partner—who’s stressed about an upcoming job loss but still financially secure—promised to buy the one remaining essential item: the newborn car seat, which still hasn’t happened despite several calm talks. He’s instead looked at used or unsuitable seats and recently went to collect a non-newborn seat from a friend whose child is sick, minimizing the infection risk afterward. I asked him to stay at his flat to avoid any chance of me getting sick before surgery, and now I’m questioning whether I’m overreacting, acting out of hormones, or if this situation reflects deeper issues—and whether I should just order the car seat myself.

The full story:

I'm 37,5,w pregnant, my scheduled C-section is in 10 days. My partner and I happen to have a neuralgical point around the pregnancy that seems so marginal and yet I feel it symbolizes some bigger issues. 

I took care of taking inventory, buying and cleaning all the baby stuff. He drove me to collect the bigger items but did not contribute financially. He's in the process of losing his job and so the past months were extremely stressful to him and I tried my best to help him. He's an IT director and it's not the case that he's losing any money as of yet or in the near future and his options for re-employment are also good. He also has savings, I don't. Plus he's a divorced papa with a teenager and a young adult and I understand what this means in terms of financial committments and indeed myself also prefer him to take care of his already existing children first. Yet I felt the need to bring up the disparity in our contributions. It's not the case that he's not helping at all because since he's at home due to his work situation, he's been doing all the food shopping, all the cooking and home logistics, including painting the nursery.  I pay a cleaning lady but the daily things he's really taking care of. Still, I felt I need to bring up the disparity in our preparation dynamics for the baby. We had at least 2 occasions when I was crying (for instance after I paid a bigger unexpected cost item after which he shared with me how many hundred euros of interest his savings brought in January while I gave out my last cents), and another 2-3 calm, non-accusatory serious talks around this topic to try to better understand each other. During these, he admitted that he's stressed for the job situation and promised to contribute more once it's settled and buy the car seat for the baby - the last missing item. 

Now, we still don't have the car seat even though he knows that I'm stressing about it and considering taking a loan from my brother to ease my mind and have it. Originally I didn't mind having it only later or during my hospital stay (C-section means at least 4 days of hospital in this country). But the other evening I caught him browsing used ones, even though we reveived the advice that woth all other baby items, having 2nd hand is ok but for the car seat there are safety risks unless we knkw the seller in person and trust that they didn't have an accident. We agreed to buy a new one therefore, and I asked him to be honest, if he cannot invest in, I can take over just let me know and I will prepare accodingly. 

In parallel, a friend of his offered us a car seat to buy (! For a small price but still) but it's for bigger kids, not for newborns. My partner wanted to buy it anyhow, even though he knows that it's not a priority for now. Today we meant to collect it and use the opportunity to come over to their place for a coffee. In the afternoon, his friend called us to cancel as his daughter is sick. My partner still insisted on collecting the seat. I told him to avoid the risk, it's not urgent etc. but it was too late. After that, I asked him to stay at his old flat because I really don't want to get sick 10 days before giving birth. I feel myserable at this point without the extra risk. He understood on the surface and will stay but kept telling me that he met the friend outdoors, no handshake, and said friend was even wearing a mask. For me, the fact that he had to wear a mask alone is telling. It's indeed a small risk of infection in this case but not zero and what's more importamt, completley unneccessary. 

What I'm wondering:
- Am I overreacting, is this my hormones,mood swings speaking?

- Or am I just playing a game and punishing him and use the health risk only as an alibi?

- Should I order the car seat myself?

* Link your habits together in chains—perform the action you want to turn into a habit after an existing habit, e.g., ""after pouring my morning coffee, I will pour myself a large glass of water.""
* Put more effort into the first half of the day – research shows that morning habits are almost twice as successful as evening habits, most likely because the psychological resources needed in the evening have already been used up.
* Try to find a solution that makes you happy, because inner satisfaction is the most excellent motivator and ensures the longest-lasting habits. For example, if you are developing the habit of eating healthily, look for healthy foods that you like, rather than forcing yourself to eat healthy foods that you don't like. I want to repeat this: healthy food must be tasty; otherwise, unhealthy tasty food is guaranteed to win.
* Use digital tools—apps and reminders — that make food preparation and cooking easier; review and edit your digital content channels so you don't see incentives to eat heavily processed foods.
* Monitor progress, not results – monitor how often you repeat the desired action. By monitoring progress rather than results, the desired behaviour lasts more than a third longer.

notes by hand. One guy spent fifteen minutes passionately explaining his ballpoint pens
collection and why different pens suit different purposes. I thought he was joking initially, but he
was completely serious. How do people develop this level of enthusiasm for something so
mundane?
But here's what's stuck with me: after he lent me one of his expensive pens, I noticed the
difference. It glided smoothly, didn't skip, and somehow made writing more enjoyable. Does the
tool actually affect the experience this significantly, or did my awareness of the pen's quality
change my perception?
I've been paying attention to small objects I use daily since then. My cheap coffee mug versus
my favorite one. Generic versus name-brand sticky notes. The differences seem trivial until you
really notice them. Should we invest more thoughtfully in everyday items, or is this overthinking
simple purchases?
I've browsed pen options online, including specialty retailers and bulk suppliers on Alibaba, and
I'm amazed by the variety. What makes someone a pen enthusiast? At what point does
preference become obsession? Has anyone else discovered unexpected appreciation for
mundane objects? What changed your perspective on seemingly trivial purchases?",2,1767982284.0,pen,1,1.0,False

About a year ago, I discovered multiple betrayals that completely shattered my trust.

At that time, I found:

\* Saved photos of women he knew (including coworkers) in sexualized contexts.

\* Screen recordings/videos of another woman’s social media content that he was using sexually.

\* A hidden, overly close “friendship” with a female coworker (let’s call her Mia), who he had mutual feelings with \*before\* me. He lied about seeing her and hid their interactions.

That period destroyed me mentally. I developed severe anxiety, went back to therapy, and it was one of the hardest times of my life. I chose to stay because I believed people can grow and change.

I set \*\*one main boundary\*\*: he needed to distance himself from Mia (no one-on-one hangouts), be honest with me, and do real inner work. I also asked him to go to therapy. He technically went, but avoided using insurance because he didn’t want his parents to find out, used a cheap online service, and quit after about 3 sessions.

Fast forward to now. I found out (again \*\*on my own — he did not confess\*\*) that:

\* He has been regularly texting this same coworker (good morning texts, late-night conversations around 1am, talking about future things like dogs, him making her coffees at work).

\* He admitted he used her for validation because he is insecure and liked the attention.

\* He admitted he fantasized about being with someone else and used a picture of \*her\* to do that.

\* He admitted he has “voids” he seeks out from other women and said it wasn’t just her — he has to “hold himself back” from other girls too.

\* He said what happened a year ago “wasn’t as big of a deal as it was made to be.”

\* He admitted he wanted a break months ago but didn’t say anything because I was crying and he felt guilty, so instead he stayed, bought me things, and took me out while internally feeling bitter.

They are close again and she surprised him with flowers and cake for his birthday, and buys him stuff.

He says he loves me and always has, but also says he lost “attraction/spark/excitement” and resented that I knew his struggles and secrets. Now that everything has come out, he is panicking, crying, saying I deserve better, and saying he wants to do the work and doesn’t want to lose me.

I don’t feel guilty for finding out, my gut was right. But I feel devastated because I already gave him a chance after the first round of betrayals, did the emotional work, and trusted him again. It feels like the same wound reopened, only worse.

We are currently together but taking space. I’m scared of leaving and scared of staying. I want marriage and kids someday and I’m terrified of wasting more time, but I also feel attached and heartbroken.

**AIO for feeling like I can’t trust him and that this pattern won’t change, even if he promises therapy and growth now? How do you rebuild after this? Do I give him another chance? Any advice please.**",1,1767982238.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

Today wasn’t easy.

At around 8 PM, which is usually when my cravings peak, I went out to a coffee spot instead of isolating myself at home. Had a cinnamon latte, just trying to ride out the urge without making a bad decision.

I also did meet one of my colleague today who vapes, and he was vaping right in front of me, blowing the smoke on my face without really thinking about it. At one point, he even offered me a puff.

I said no.

He laughed and said something like, “Don’t worry, you’ll definitely relapse by tonight or tomorrow.”

That messed with my head for a second, not gonna lie.

But… I’m still here.

I didn’t relapse.

I didn’t vape.

I’m building an early-stage startup called Moments — it’s a platform for short, premium micro-experiences.
Not rentals, not long bookings.

Think things like:
	•	sunset access on a private rooftop
	•	short luxury car or superbike experiences
	•	aesthetic spaces for quiet coffee / photos

I’m currently onboarding a small, curated set of asset owners in Hyderabad to test this idea. There’s no commitment or cost — just exploring demand.

If you:
	•	own a villa / rooftop / luxury car / superbike
	•	OR know someone who does

I’d really appreciate an intro or a DM.
Happy to explain the idea clearly and transparently.

Thanks 🙏

1q8fj21,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1q8fj21/how_to_be_more_attractive_the_psychology_that/,How to Be More ATTRACTIVE: The Psychology That Actually Works (Most Advice is Pure BS),"Look, I've spent way too many hours scrolling through self-improvement content, and most of it's recycled garbage. ""Just be confident bro"" or ""hit the gym"" like we haven't heard that 10,000 times already. So I went deep, really deep into books, research papers, podcasts from actual psychologists and neuroscientists, not just random dudes on YouTube. What I found actually changed how I see attractiveness entirely.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: attractiveness isn't what you think it is. We've been fed this narrative by dating apps, social media, Instagram models that it's all about jaw lines and abs. That's like 20% of the equation at best. The other 80%? It's psychological, behavioral, and completely trainable.

**The stuff that actually moves the needle:**

**Stop trying to be attractive, start being interesting.** Research from evolutionary psychology shows humans are wired to seek novelty and competence. When you develop genuine skills, weird hobbies, or deep knowledge in random areas, you become magnetic. Not because you're performing, but because you're genuinely engaged with life. I started learning about mycology (mushroom cultivation) and urban foraging, sounds weird right? People are WAY more intrigued by that than my gym routine.

**Your voice matters more than your face.** No joke. Studies show vocal tone affects perceived attractiveness almost as much as physical appearance. Deeper, slower speech patterns signal confidence and calmness. There's this app called Vocular that analyzes your voice and helps you train it. Sounds ridiculous but after two weeks of doing vocal exercises while driving, multiple people told me I ""seemed different."" Wild.

**Micro-expressions and body language are everything.** Dr. Paul Ekman's research on facial coding is insane. Most people leak insecurity through tiny facial movements they don't even notice. The book ""What Every BODY is Saying"" by Joe Navarro (ex-FBI agent) breaks down exactly how to read and control nonverbal communication. This book will make you question everything you think you know about human interaction. Seriously changed how I show up in conversations. You'll start noticing when you're closing yourself off, when you're faking interest, when you're trying too hard.

**Get comfortable being uncomfortable.** Charisma isn't about being smooth, it's about being unshakeable when things get awkward. The research on stress inoculation shows that deliberately putting yourself in mildly uncomfortable social situations literally rewires your amygdala response. Started using this app Slowly (it's like old school pen pals, super low pressure) to practice vulnerable conversations with strangers. Helped me get comfortable with authentic connection without the performance anxiety.

**Scent is criminally underrated.** Pheromone research is sketchy, but olfactory psychology is legit. Wearing a signature scent that YOU like (not what marketers tell you) creates memory anchors in people's brains. Also, basic hygiene sounds obvious but most people are walking around with coffee breath and don't realize it. Get a tongue scraper, it's gross but effective.

**Stop consuming content that makes you feel inadequate.** The comparison loop is poison. Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman talks extensively about dopamine dysregulation from social media. Every time you scroll through highlight reels, you're literally training your brain to feel insufficient. I use One Sec app, it adds a breathing exercise before opening social media. Annoying as hell but cut my usage by like 60%.

For anyone serious about this stuff, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that's been useful for diving deeper into behavioral psychology and communication. Founded by Columbia grads and ex-Google engineers, it pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and psychology books to create personalized audio content. You can ask it to build a learning plan around something specific like ""become more charismatic as an introvert"" or ""improve nonverbal communication,"" and it generates podcasts tailored to your depth preference, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with actual examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's this sarcastic narrator style that makes dense psychology research way more digestible. It's helped connect a lot of the dots between books like ""The Charisma Myth"" and practical application.

**Read ""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane.** This book breaks down charisma into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth. She was a keynote speaker at Stanford and Harvard, coached executives at Google. Her framework is stupidly practical. You'll realize charisma isn't some magical thing you're born with, it's literally just skills you can practice. Insanely good read that strips away all the mystical BS around magnetism.

**Develop opinions and express them.** Most people are terrified of being disliked so they stay neutral on everything. But research on interpersonal attraction shows that people with clear viewpoints (even controversial ones) are perceived as more attractive than agreeable people-pleasers. Obviously don't be an insufferable contrarian, but have a spine.

**The honest truth:** Biology, society, algorithms, they've all conspired to make us feel inadequate so we keep consuming, keep comparing, keep chasing. Your brain's reward system is being hijacked daily. But here's the good part, once you understand the mechanisms, you can actually work with your neurology instead of against it.

Attractiveness is like 10% genetics, 20% grooming and fitness, and 70% how you make people feel around you. And that last part? Totally learnable. You're not broken, the game's just rigged. But now you know the actual rules.",1,1767981937.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

It’s gotten me through this past year of being diagnosed (at 36, Oct. 2024). Couldn’t be more grateful for this group 🙌

Traveling to Thailand for 2 weeks, and I have a few specific questions:

Here’s my deets - (on MDI still, 5 units + sliding scale + 18:1 carb ratio, Lantus 13 units before bed, using Dexcom G7)

1. Scuba. How does that…work? Should I cover my Dexcom with a SkinGrip, or is that not necessary? Does depth have an effect on BS? I have an Apple Watch, so I can check my levels whenever needed (hopefully). 
Eat before? 
In the future, if I get a pump, how does that work?

2. What do I do with my sharps? Since I’m still using pens, I’ll likely have about 4 pen needle caps per day. That’s gonna add up to quite the pile. 

3. The food. I plan to eat a ton of it. Street vendors everywhere, endless options. It’s like a dream 🥹 
I kinda have the hang of guesstimating carbs. I know rice will come back to get me 3 hrs later, so I’ll try to avoid that. 
Do I dare inject in public there?
What about the fun coffee drinks? I’ll try to ask for sugar free as often as possible, but that brings me to another question:

How the heck do I figure out how much insulin I need for sweet stuff? I feel like that was never covered after diagnosis, and I’ve been gambling with it ever since 😅

4. Say all my extra Dexcoms fail. I have my BG meter, but does anyone happen to know if they have CGMs available there? 

5. Currently I take my Lantus at 2am when I go to bed. There is a 12 hr time difference between home and Thailand. 
Brain cannot compute. Plz help.

That’s it for now. Thank you for any and all advice! First big trip, getting a little nervous, but I have faith that you pros can throw some solid tips my way 🫡

I know I’m getting too old to expect much on my birthday, but it’s been disappointing my entire life. Having an early January birthday is hard in general, but I have never had someone make an effort to make it special. 

I did have one person. My freshman year of college, I had a boy who made me feel special every day, and on my birthday, he went above and beyond. Organized an entire day of surprises for me, had gifts that were so personally tailored for me, and overall just made me feel loved. 

We aren’t together anymore and I’m now with a different man and we’ve been together for 2 years. On my first birthday, we had only been together for a couple of months so his gifts were mostly snacks and I understood. Last year, he could not afford to get me a gift because his car needed repairs. 

I guess I’ve been secretly hoping that he would make the effort that college boy did. Alas, he was not even the first person to tell me Happy Birthday today, more like the fifteenth. He has gotten me no gifts, not even flowers or an iced coffee, and has actually negatively affected my day in his general demeanor. 

I’ve seen a lot of posts about making things special for yourself, and I think there’s a lot of truth to that, but I can’t ignore the way it makes me feel when my birthday feels brushed to the side. It’s almost like nobody cares that I’m here.",2,1767981773.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

No woman walks away from her boyfriend’s phone with a smile.
On Mason Ward’s Instagram, the pinned DMs at the very top now included a girl Harper Lane had never heard of, saved under a cutesy nickname: “Crybaby Kitten.”
They talked about everything and nothing. Good morning, good night. The song stuck in their heads, the weather, the stupid memes they sent back and forth. They were even planning to spend New Year’s Eve together on the Aegean Sea.
And Harper, the girlfriend who had been with him for seven years, knew none of it.
She didn’t scream. She didn’t throw the phone at the wall. Instead, she booked a one-way ticket out of the city and scheduled an appointment to end the ten-week pregnancy he still knew nothing about.
—
When Mason got back from a business trip and went straight into the shower, Harper stayed behind in the bedroom, folding his discarded clothes out of habit.
A small slip of paper fell from the pocket of his slacks and drifted to the floor.
She bent down and picked it up.
It was a receipt from an upscale jewelry store downtown, the kind that specialized in custom engagement rings.
Seven years ago, Mason had laughed and told her, “A ring only counts if it’s for a proposal. I’m not wasting that card before I’m ready.”
For a moment, Harper’s chest warmed. Maybe he was finally ready. Maybe this was supposed to be the surprise, the big moment.
Before she could talk herself out of that tiny spark of hope, his phone started buzzing on the nightstand.
Incoming call: Crybaby Kitten.
Harper’s fingers moved before her brain did. She picked up. On the other end, a soft, sugary girl’s voice filled her ear. “Mason? The ring’s a little too big. Can you come with me tomorrow and get it resized?”
Harper’s breath stalled. Her mind went blank, as if someone had hit a mute button on the world.
She tightened her grip on the phone, forcing her voice to sound steady. “He’s in the shower. I’ll have him call you back.”
There was a pause—two seconds of dead air. Then the line went dead.
The rush of water from the bathroom kept going, a steady hiss behind the closed door. The phone in Harper’s hand felt strangely warm, like it might burn straight through her palm.
She turned the screen on and swiped up to unlock it.
9–6–1–0–2–8.
Her birthday.
They’d always told each other they trusted one another completely. They didn’t check each other’s phones. They’d just swapped passcodes years ago as a silly, romantic gesture. Mason hadn’t bothered to change it. 
The home screen slid open. Harper tapped into Instagram and went straight to his messages. Two chats were pinned at the top.
Second: Harper Lane.
First: Crybaby Kitten.
People liked to say there isn’t a woman on earth who can smile her way out of her boyfriend’s messages. 
They were right.
Harper opened the top chat. Message after message rolled up the screen, and with every line her stomach seemed to drop another inch.
Crybaby Kitten had a real name. It was right there in one of Mason’s early replies: Chloe Jensen. Three months ago, Elaine Ward had set them up on a “casual dinner” that was clearly anything but casual.
The chat history read like an autopsy of Harper’s last few months.
The night of Harper’s birthday, Mason had texted her that he was slammed at the office and couldn’t make it. At the same time, he was sending Chloe the address of a wine bar with, Can’t wait to finally see you in person.
When Harper ended up in the ER with stomach pain, he’d told her he’d been called out of town on a last-minute trip and couldn’t get back in time. In Chloe’s DMs, he was sending her photos from a weekend getaway—sunset over the water, matching cocktails clinking on a balcony in Maui.
Their messages were constant, dense, a whole private world that started at “good morning” and didn’t end until “sleep well” hours after midnight. Every meme got a reply. Every photo got a reaction. Every “I’m tired” pulled a “Get some rest, I’ll call you later.”
Harper’s own chat with him looked pathetic in comparison. A string of blue bubbles trying to hold up both sides of the conversation.
Are you eating on time?
My stomach’s acting up again, doctor says I need to rest more.
Do you think you’ll make it back for my birthday?
His replies were always the same four beats: Yeah. Ok. Got it. Working late not coming home.
He saved Chloe as Crybaby Kitten, but saved Harper as just Harper.
Seven years and three months. Side by side, the comparison was almost funny—if it hadn’t been her life.
Harper swallowed down the burn in her throat and forced herself to keep going. She opened his photos.
Other than a few work screenshots, almost everything recent was travel shots of Mason and Chloe. Airports. Hotel lobbies. A beach selfie, his arm around her shoulders, sun in their eyes, her face half-buried in his chest like she belonged there.
Harper scrolled through them one by one, punishing herself, taking in every smile, every casual touch. She felt less like a girlfriend and more like a thief breaking into someone else’s love story.
The water in the shower cut off.
Harper set the phone back on the nightstand, screen down, and drew a slow breath. By the time the bathroom door opened, her expression was as smooth and blank as fresh glass.
Mason walked out with a towel slung low around his hips, droplets of water sliding down over a lean, V-shaped torso that would’ve made most women stop and stare.
He didn’t give her a chance to look away. He sat on the edge of the bed and leaned over her like an overexcited dog, all skin and heat and habit.
Harper pressed a hand to his chest and shoved him back just enough to breathe. Her gaze flicked toward the phone on the nightstand.
“A girl called earlier,” she said, voice flat. “Crybaby Kitten.”
Mason froze. His hand slipped from her waist.
He grabbed the phone, checked the screen, and something clouded his face. “She’s a client,” he said quickly. “Big contract. We’ve been talking a lot off-hours to lock things in. Don’t overthink it.”
Harper let out a small, humorless laugh and cut clean through the lie. “She said the ring was too big and asked if you could go with her tomorrow to get it resized.”
Color drained from his face. His jaw tightened. “Did you tell her anything?”
“I told her you were in the shower,” Harper said, honest and tired.
Mason swore under his breath, already moving. He yanked on jeans, pulled a shirt over his head, grabbed his keys, and was out the door before she could even sit up.
No explanation. No apology. Just instinctive damage control—in the direction of the girl with the ring.
The apartment door slammed shut behind him.
Harper stared at the empty doorway for a beat, the silence in its wake louder than the shower had been.
Then she reached under her pillow. The folded paper was right where she’d hidden it that morning: crisp, white, stamped with the hospital’s logo at the top.
Pregnancy confirmation. Estimated at ten weeks.
She’d planned to hand it to him today, to watch his face when he realized they were finally going to be a family. She’d even imagined him pulling her into his arms, laughing, maybe promising to finally slow down.
Instead, she tore the paper slowly, strip by strip, until the words and numbers meant nothing at all.
Today had been the day Harper Lane meant to tell Mason Ward he was going to be a father.

Chapter 2
Harper and Mason didn’t just date—they built Daybreak together.
After college, Mason refused to slide into a cushy role at Ward Enterprises. He fought with his family, walked away from the Ward building with nothing but a diploma and his pride, and announced he was going to “make it on his own.”
He had the big speech. What he didn’t have was cash.
His parents cut him off the moment he said no. No allowance. No seed money. Just a last name he didn’t want to use and a bank account hovering near zero.
Harper, who’d lost both her parents before graduation, had exactly one thing of value: the six-figure payout the city gave her when they tore down her childhood home. A hundred thousand dollars. Her entire safety net.
She signed it over to him without asking for a single share in return.
Back then, he’d pulled her into his arms, eyes red, voice hoarse with gratitude.
“Harper, you’re listed as owner,” he’d insisted. “On paper, Daybreak is yours. You’re the boss. If this works, it’s because of you.”
He’d stacked promises on top of that one, breath warm against her hair in their tiny apartment.
“When the company blows up,” he’d said, “we’ll get married. I’ll walk you into the Ward family’s house in a designer dress and make them choke on how wrong they were about us. I swear.”
Harper had smiled and pushed the first promise gently back across the line.
“I don’t know how to run a business,” she’d said. “You do. You want this, you be the official owner. I’m just… backing you.”
She loved him enough to empty her entire life savings into his dream. But she was still clear-headed enough not to put her name on every future lawsuit and debt. If Daybreak crashed, she wanted the blast to hit him, not drag her under too.
Seven years later, the little start-up they’d built out of spilled coffee and sleep deprivation had turned into Daybreak Group, with shiny branch offices in multiple states and Mason’s face featured in tech magazines as the “self-made visionary CEO.”
Somewhere along the way, Mason Ward forgot the second promise.
He forgot to marry her.
Harper told herself he was just grinding, just aiming higher. That every canceled date and every unanswered text meant he had bigger numbers in his head for the both of them.
She just didn’t realize all that hard work was only really paying off for one person.
One sleepless night and one unlocked phone were all it took for her to understand that the man she’d dated for seven years was not her future—he was her warning.
That same night, she packed up her clothes, her sketchbooks, her laptop, and what was left of her pride, and moved into her best friend Mia Brooks’s apartment.
“You’ve spent the last seven years revolving around Mason Ward like he’s the sun,” Mia said, staring at the suitcases. “You’re seriously ready to walk away, just like that?”
The disbelief in Mia’s voice made something twist in Harper’s chest. It hit her then, sharp and humiliating—this was how everyone else had seen her. Not as a partner, not as an equal, but as a girl who’d made a man her entire world.
She drew in a long breath and nodded. “Seven years is enough for anyone to get tired,” she said quietly.
Mason was tired of her. And she was tired of the version of herself who kept shrinking and apologizing just to stay.
A love with no future wasn’t romantic. It was a slow bleed. The only sane thing to do was cut it off before it killed her.
—
The next morning, Harper walked into Daybreak with a resignation letter in her bag and a plan to get out clean.
She didn’t even make it to her desk before the first slap in the face.
Right in the center of the open office, Mason stood beside a petite girl in a fitted blazer and heels, smiling like a proud mentor.
“This is Chloe Jensen,” he announced. “She’ll be my personal assistant from now on.”
Chloe had her hair twisted into a cute messy bun, big eyes, glossed lips. She wiggled her fingers in a cutesy little cat-paw wave.
“Nice to meet you, everyone,” she chirped. “Don’t worry—now that I’m Mason’s PA, I’ll make sure he’s taken care of.”
Taken care of. Sure.
When the introductions were done, Mason personally escorted her into his corner office, set her up at the desk that used to be a shared space, and then pulled out his phone and added her to the company’s group chat.
Chloe’s first move after joining?
She started sending follow requests to every female employee on Instagram. One by one. Not a single man got a notification. Including Harper.
Two women in the row next to Harper watched their phones light up and rolled their eyes in unison.
“This job was already draining,” one muttered. “Now we’ve got a princess on top of it.”
“Only adding the women?” the other scoffed. “So we’re all potential threats until proven harmless?”
“Can’t tell if she doesn’t trust Mason or just doesn’t trust any of us. Either way, it’s pathetic.”
Their irritation buzzed through the air, but Harper didn’t join in. She accepted the request, tapped through to Chloe’s profile, and opened her posts.
Six months’ worth of content, each little square a piece of the last three months Chloe had spent with Mason.
On Harper’s birthday, the day Mason texted that he was “buried at the office” and couldn’t make it, Chloe had posted a dimly lit wine-bar selfie, eyes sparkling, captioned:
Most people meet horror stories on blind dates. I met my dream guy.
The day Harper had been standing in a Target aisle, tossing a pack of Mason’s favorite boxers into her cart, trying not to feel pathetic about it, Chloe had uploaded a bathroom mirror selfie in a hotel robe, steam ghosting the background.
Officially off the market. Guess I can retire all my “forever single” jokes.
The night Harper had doubled over with stomach pain and ended up in the ER alone because Mason had “a sudden client trip,” Chloe had posted a silhouette photo of herself in front of a golden mountain sunrise.
My CEO boyfriend doesn’t just make money—he also takes the best pictures of me.
Harper’s stomach lurched. Nausea rolled up her throat, sharp and dizzying, and a dull ache bloomed low in her belly.
She was about to swipe out of the app when a new story icon lit up at the top of the screen.
Chloe Jensen added to her story.
Some mix of morbid curiosity and self-destruction made Harper tap it.
Text ran across the video in bold letters:
Girl code reminder: don’t go snooping through your man’s phone. 

Chapter 3
The story was posted over a photo of a black iPhone in a matte case.
Harper recognized it in a single heartbeat. It was Mason’s phone.
She knew because she was the one who’d picked out that case for him.
For a guy born with a silver spoon shoved so far down his throat he’d never had to lift a finger, Mason Ward was a complete man-child in every ordinary part of life.
Boxers, socks, phone cases, his daily suits and ties—every little thing most adults handled on autopilot, Harper had quietly taken care of for him. She’d been his personal shopper, stylist, and walking reminder app for years.
“Hey, Harper,” Jess Lopez—everyone called her Jess, the queen of office gossip—leaned over the partition with a smirk. “You think Chloe’s gonna be our future Mrs. Ward?”
The question snapped Harper’s thoughts back into the room.
She smoothed her expression, the corners of her mouth lifting in the ghost of a polite smile. “No idea.”
Daybreak had a strict no-dating policy on the books. No one was supposed to be in a relationship with their coworkers, and definitely not with the CEO. Officially, at least.
Which was why nobody knew Harper had been sleeping next to Mason for the past seven years.
Now Chloe had arrived—with her cat-paw waves and lightning-bolt stories—and that policy was probably about to get rewritten.
Harper drained a cup of cold water at the break counter, trying to flush the bitterness down with it. When she’d finally pieced herself back together, she grabbed a folder and walked over to Mason’s office, knocking lightly before stepping inside.
Chloe wasn’t there.
The moment Mason saw Harper, he picked up the small remote on his desk and hit a button. The office door clicked shut and locked behind her.
“Was just about to come find you,” he said, mouth curling into a familiar, cocky grin. “Nice of you to deliver yourself.”
He reached for her, fingers hooking into her wrist, tugging her into the space between his legs like he’d done a hundred times before. Desire, lazy and entitled, gleamed in his eyes.
He’d had her on this desk more times than she could count.
There had even been a time he’d pulled her under it, unzipping his slacks while he kept a perfectly straight face and led a Zoom meeting with his senior staff, voice smooth as if nothing at all was happening below the camera line.
Thirty years old, and his stamina ran like an engine that didn’t know how to shut off.
But this time, Harper didn’t melt into him.
She braced her hand against his chest and pushed herself free.
“This is my resignation,” she said, setting the folder down on his desk.
Mason’s brows lifted. He picked up the document, skimming the first lines, then looked back at her with a half-amused, half-exasperated tilt to his head.
“You’re mad,” he said. “Is this because of Chloe?”
Harper didn’t answer.
He sighed, like she was being unreasonable and he was the patient one here. “Daybreak’s getting ready to go public. My family finally agreed to back us, but they put one condition on the table—I had to give it a shot with Chloe. Jensen family, Jensen connections. You get it.”
His tone turned coaxing, reasonable. “I’m just… playing along for now. Showing the Wards I’m willing to cooperate. Once the IPO’s done and the company is solid, I’ll cut things off with her. She’s temporary.”
He reached for her hand again, rubbed his thumb over her knuckles like he could massage the doubt out of her.
“Harper, when I had nothing, you were the only one who stayed,” he said softly. “I’m not some ungrateful asshole. I promised I’d give you a home, and I keep my promises.”
His eyes locked onto hers, earnest and intense. “Just give me a little more time. Let me get Daybreak fully locked in, and I’ll give you everything you’ve ever wanted.”
Harper felt something inside her cooling, layer by layer, like ice forming over the surface of a lake.
She realized she had never really seen him clearly.
The broke, cut-off Mason who’d once cried over a stranger buying him a bowl of noodle soup had genuinely believed in loyalty and kindness. But this Mason—the one riding the high of his own success—had learned a new religion: if there was profit to be made, feelings were just another chip to play.
And she was one of the chips.
Harper slipped her hand out of his grip and looked at him steadily. “And you truly think I can just… keep waiting?”
“Of course you can,” Mason said immediately, as if it were obvious. He turned back to the desk, slid her resignation letter into the shredder slot, and watched the paper disappear in thin white strips. “Because you know I’ll make it worth it.”
She didn’t answer.
She simply turned, unlocked the door, and walked out.
She’d barely cracked the door open when she nearly ran into Chloe standing right outside, her hand half-raised as if she’d been debating whether to knock.
Chloe’s expression was tight, her eyes darting over Harper from head to toe like she was trying to calculate exactly what had been happening behind the closed door.
Harper stepped sideways to pass.
“Harper,” Chloe’s voice piped up behind her, sugary with an edge of steel. “Since I’m Mason’s personal assistant now, if you want to see him, you’re gonna need to go through me. Please don’t just walk into his office without checking with me first.”
The challenge was obvious. So was the territorial claim.
Harper’s mouth twitched. She turned back slowly, looking down at the woman who stood a good half a head shorter than her.
“This is an office, Miss Jensen,” she said, voice cool. “People come here to work, not to play house. Maybe focus on the job title, not whatever you think you’re gonna be calling him.”
Color rose in Chloe’s cheeks, embarrassment twisting her pretty features. Then something else clicked behind her eyes—the familiarity of Harper’s voice, maybe. The memory of last night’s phone call and the calm, neutral “He’s in the shower” on the other end.
“You…” Chloe’s face went from pink to furious red. She lifted her hand, anger snapping across her expression, and brought her palm down in a sharp, stinging slap across Harper’s cheek.
Harper’s pupils narrowed.
She really had no idea who she was picking a fight with.
Harper’s hand came up almost on instinct, fingers curling as she swung back, her palm connecting with Chloe’s face in a hard, resounding crack.",1,1767981435.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

He approached me, asked for my number, and I said no, but in a soft and polite way. We still ended up talking for about ten minutes, and while I wasn’t immediately attracted to him, he had a quiet charm. He asked for my number again, and instead I gave him my social media. I was very clear that he shouldn’t have expectations. He replied by saying something like, “I don’t with women,” and mentioned that he’d been heartbroken a lot in the past.

After that, he reached out. I told him I wasn’t sure our values aligned. He responded respectfully, explained his values but vaguely, and said he’d still love to see me again. I didn’t respond. At that time, I was dealing with personal stuff and dating was the last thing on my mind. About a week later, he reached out again. Still kind, still no pressure. I didn’t reply.

Two months went by, and he messaged again, inviting me out for coffee and emphasizing that it would be very low pressure. His message was actually really thoughtful, and for the first time, I started to change my mind. Unfortunately, I got sick around that time, so I postponed. When he thought I might be feeling better, he reached out once more, and I finally agreed to the coffee date (it's in 4 days). 

In the meantime, I did some light social media stalking. Honestly, it made me think even more positively of him. He seems calm, emotionally mature, and thoughtful. Then I found his Spotify..

He has a whole playlist filled with breakup songs and songs about longing for a lost love or ex (playlist was made in 2021 but he's actively adding songs to it every now and then). Some of them are very emotionally heavy. Combined with his earlier comment about being heartbroken, it suddenly made me feel uneasy. Now I’m worried he might not be over his ex, and I’m questioning whether I should even go on the date.

What confuses me is that his behavior doesn’t really match that fear. He’s been consistent over months, respectful, patient, and never pressured me when I didn’t respond.

So now I’m wondering if I’m reading way too much into a Spotify playlist, or if this is actually something I should be concerned about..?

I’d really appreciate any honest thoughts. Thank you!",0,1767981311.0,dating_advice,13,0.5,False

I realized I’m missing the fun part: sharing the interest with other people who actually care why one fragrance smells amazing and another smells like regret.If you’re into niche, designer, blind buys, or just enjoy smelling like a walking mood ,let’s connect. Could be grabbing a coffee, swapping samples, or just geeking out over fragrances.

This is my first attempt at a query letter - I've been sat on my finished manuscript for about 6 months now just going back and conducting edits and think I'm ready to start querying it. This would be my debut so I've never queried before - please be brutal hahaha.

Two concerns right off the bat - firstly, the curse word in the first sentence. It's the first word that my manuscript opens on (as the book opens on undermentioned blog review), but I'm not sure how appealing/appropriate that is to agents, so though it's a direct quote from the book I am open to removing it/replacing it. Secondly, the title - the book is named after a band, Guthook (pronounced Gut-hook), but several proofreaders have gently told me that it took them a while to realise it wasn't pronounced Guth-ook, so I thought splitting it into Gut/Hook would make it clear (plus connotations of guts and hooks in terms of writing and music yadda yadda yadda). So any & all thoughts on that are strongly appreciated!

Anyway, here is the letter!

\---

Dear Agent,

Mabel Adesina’s blog review of rock band Guthook opens with a single verdict: *dogshit*. The ensuing post ‘*All Guts, No Hook’* goes viral, squashing the fledgling band’s prospects and launching Mabel to overnight success.

Seven years later, all Mabel has to show for it is a drab, dead-end job at a music magazine where she fetches coffees and edits amateurish writing. When her boss assigns her to follow Guthook on their first headline tour across the UK, now resurrected as a promising, tightly wound act, it seems like a second chance. The band believes the resulting profile will finally catapult them to national recognition. In reality, Mabel has been instructed to take them down again.

As the tour grinds on, Mabel’s proximity to the band—particularly their sharp-eyed bassist, Kit Wiley, who is harbouring his own closeted skeletons—forces her to confront what her stalled career has allowed her to ignore. The dead end she’s hit isn’t about her lack of ambition, but her isolation. Living shoulder-to-shoulder on a tour bus, she begins to see how loneliness has shaped every choice she’s made, including the ruinous article she now feels compelled to deliver. And when a terrible incident occurs at the band's largest live show to date, a nadir of the Guthook's career that could be the peak of Mabel's, she is forced to reckon with what truly matters in her life.

**Gut/Hook** is an 85,000-word contemporary, character-driven novel in which the rock-and-roll world of *Daisy Jones & The Six* meets the workplace ennui of *I Hope This Finds You Well*. It’s a story about music, friendship and the perils of trying to quit smoking.

1q8f3x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1q8f3x3/was_the_behavior_of_this_colleague_and_her/,Was the behavior of this colleague and her husband normal?,"
I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

1q8f23e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1q8f23e/aita_told_my_boyfriend_id_stop_paying_for_his/,AITA -- Told my boyfriend I'd stop paying for his groceries and his meals,"I've (28f) been with my boyfriend (27m) for over a year and a half. For the first year we were dating, I was in a stable job and a decent place financially. He was in grad school getting his master's in a different state, and was getting paid by the school but not really making a sustainable amount of money. He would only come visit me for the weekends, and I'd provide all the groceries and in exchange he would cook.

After a year, he moved to my city to be with me and start working. He got a job pretty quickly, working two days a week but making almost what I would make in a 40 hour week at my old job. Around the same time, I quit my job to become a freelancer at what I thought would be a good time for me. I had some money saved up and some contacts. However, about a week after quitting my job, my mother and I went no contact and she turned my entire family against me. So the month he moved here, I basically lost my entire family and started dealing with a deep depression AND was unemployed on top of it. (The falling out with my mother had to do with the fact that I was working overtime to send her money every week and I needed to stop doing that for my mental health a couple of years ago. She insisted that I was responsible for helping her sign a mortgage and contributing to debts she took on on my behalf when I was a child. Because I had *just* become unemployed and wasn't able to meet those requirements for her, the relationship between my mother and I ended).

My boyfriend ended up being my only support system during the summer, which i understand now was not fair to him and I have made an active effort to repair the damage that my emotional dependency caused on our relationship. In November, he stated that he could no longer support me emotionally in the same way that he had been doing. During this time, I was so broke, doing odd jobs and taking loans out at the bank to make ends meet, all while struggling with suicidal ideation and depression. I would pay for all of our groceries (his and mine) on my food stamps because I felt guilty about how much I was relying on him, even though it made it even harder for me to make ends meet (i know now that this was really codependent). My boyfriend would spend most of his own paychecks on weed and coffee, as his parents were paying his rent during this time.

Last month, after my boyfriend set some emotional boundaries with me and I started getting treatment and medication for my depression and doing a lot better even financially (still unemployed, still on food stamps, but finding more luck with odd jobs and freelance work), his parents cut him off financially and said he would need to start paying his own rent. Me and him share a car and split the car insurance, and since his parents cut him off i've been covering the car insurance which has caused me to be behind on my own rent. I also have explained to him several times in the past few months that I can't keep supporting him on my food stamps anymore, but its hard because he will say things like how he is so hungry and hasn't eaten all day and I feel like if I have the resources to feed him I should. However, i've also been asking him for months to apply to food stamps since i'm sure he would qualify and he hasn't.

Its hard because I am trying to dig myself out of a hole, not just for myself, but for the sake of my relationship. I really love him and care about him a lot, but now that he has to be on his own financially I feel like I've taken on a lot more of the burden that his parents were carrying. I've paid for basically every breakfast lunch and dinner for the both of us on my food stamps for the past two months, and explained to him almost every time the strain it puts on me. Today, i just casually asked him, ""Can you please finish your food stamp application today?"" I don't ask him for the money he owes me, or to apply for a second job, just that. And he got so upset with me for asking. Eventually the conversation escalated to a point where I just said, ""I will not be feeding you anymore,"" which felt really horrible to say. His response was that I am holding food over his head and that just made me feel even worse. I don't know what to do. I have been financially independent for the past 10 years, and even in my worst moments was expected to provide some sort of allowance for my mother. I feel like this pattern is repeating with my boyfriend, who has 5 days a week where he isn't working and could get another job, or at the very least have time to apply for food stamps.

He left my apartment just now and made me feel like I needed to apologize to him for asking that of him, telling me that I'm not his mother and throwing the time after I lost contact with my family in my face, saying how much he supported me and how unfair that was to him. I agree that it was unfair, but I've taken accountability for my life since then and was just trying to hold him accountable because I care for him. I feel so horrible and guilty but I was only trying to do the right thing. He also said that he would have done the food stamps application already if I had offered at any point to sit with him and do it (which I have offered) but because I'm too busy all the time he can't do it (I'm busy working random gigs 4-6 days a week). Am I the asshole? I don't get any unemployment, all I get from the government is ebt and I know its ""free money"" but Its the only way I can eat right now.

TLDR; My boyfriend who has emotionally supported me a lot in the past is upset that I am cutting him off from my government assistance while he's in a tough spot",5,1767980917.0,AITA_Relationships,2,1.0,False

1q8ez01,https://www.reddit.com/r/YearUpProgram/comments/1q8ez01/how_to_win_year_up/,How To Win Year Up,"# What You Need To Know: 

**1. They do NOT help you after the internship**  
Once you graduate, they stop responding. There is no real support after the program.

**2. If you get a job offer before finishing, TAKE IT**  
They may pressure you to stay so you can complete the contract and they can get paid. They will say you’ll lose alumni benefits if you leave early. **Don't fall for it.** The alumni network gives you nothing. You came for a job, **take the job**.

**3. You will NOT become a Project Manager or Investment Banker in 6 months**  
Those roles take years of experience. Don’t believe that dream. The alumni who have became Project Managers or Investment Bankers got converted after their internship onto an entry level role and worked their way up. Key: THIS IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF YOU GET CONVERTED

**4. Alumni are told what NOT to talk about**  
Alumni are used as free marketing for Year Up. We know what we aren't supposed to say or we are told what not to say. The alumni's you'll be speaking with are only the ones with the lucky success stories. They'll say they got into a really nice company got converted and was able to do all sorts of things which is not the reality for most students. They are selling you a dream.

**5. Companies pay Year Up a lot of money**  
You are basically a contractor. Year Up keeps most of the money. The big companies do this for financial, business, and PR reasons, **not charity**.

**6. It's Not Your Fault / Avoid Project Management Internship Spots** \- I have seen top students do everything right. They networked, showed up on time, participated consistently, and outshined the entire cohort. They earned strong grades with almost no deductions. Even so, some of them were not converted or were placed in weak internships such as Project Management. While Project Management can be a good role, it rarely leads to real job opportunities. Employers are unlikely to hire someone with no degree and only a six month project management internship, even if it is with a large company like Facebook. After the internship, many of these students were left on their own. At that point, going back to school often becomes the better option, even though it defeats the original purpose of Year Up. Still, it can be a smart decision. Make sure to clearly tell your Year Up counselor that you do not want to work in Project Management. The best internships are entry level roles where you have a real chance of getting hired or finding a job on your own, such as Office Assistant or IT Support.

**7. Don't Take Abuse During Internship -** If you are being treated badly at your internship, speak up. **Talk to Year Up** about what is happening before going to anyone else and let them handle it. I have seen students stay silent because they think speaking up will hurt their chances of being converted later. What actually happens is that the next intern comes in and faces the same problems. This creates an unfair cycle that continues until someone finally speaks up. Here is the truth. If you are being treated poorly, that company is not planning to bring you back anyway. Staying quiet does not protect your future. Speak up and advocate for yourself. They will respect you more for it.

**8. Kiss Up -** I wish I knew this earlier. Both Year Up and internship sites really love when you are a kiss up. It may sound annoying, but trust me, it is worth it. Year Up wants to see that you are engaged in class and genuinely interested in learning. When you show that, you are more likely to get better internship placements. Ask follow up questions like ""what does this do?"" or ""why do we do it this way"". They love it. Even if you don't have a question, make one up but don't do it when the question is obvious. Internship sites also love when you make their jobs easier. If you have nothing to do, ask your boss if there is anything you can help with. If there truly is nothing to do, ask another team at your internship site if they need assistance. Taking initiative goes a long way and people notice it.

**9. Take Advantage Of Internship Employees**

When you are an intern, many people are genuinely interested in mentoring you and helping you grow. A lot of professionals enjoy guiding young people as they enter the working world. Always introduce yourself as an intern and ask for coffee chats. Ask about their background, how they got to their current role, and why they do the work they do. Always ask for career advice and interview tips. These conversations can open doors and help you learn things you would not get from class alone.

**10. If You Don't Have A Degree -** Year Up partners with local community colleges. If you do not have a college degree, do this. After Year Up, you will already have about a year of college completed. One more year and you will have an Associate degree. I recommend getting a basic degree in Business. It is extremely hard to move forward in the corporate environment without a degree. A basic Associate business degree is universal and can open doors to entry level roles where you can grow and move up over time. Plus someone straight up told us the truth during internship which was that we need to get a degree of some sort.

**11. Professional LinkedIn Photo -** This is very important. Create a clean and professional LinkedIn profile. Wear a professional outfit such as a black suit, white button up shirt, and black tie. Smile and take the photo in very good lighting. Once you have the photo, send it to a freelancer online to lightly edit it. This usually costs around ten dollars and is worth it. DO NOT use an AI generated profile picture. It looks unprofessional and will not be taken seriously.

  
**How I Won -** 

I posted on LinkedIn thanking Year Up and got a lot of attention.  
But **my success came from my own work**, not them.

What Year Up *actually* helped with:

* Job readiness
* Interview practice
* Resume formatting
* How to talk and act in corporate spaces

I took those seriously. I knew these would be the very important skills I would need after graduation to land a job.

During my internship:

* My last 2 months at my internship site I applied to **5 entry level jobs a day**
* I did many virtual interviews 
* I booked **1-on-1 meetings every week** with Year Up Staff and Mentors I met at my Internship site
* I asked for resume help and interview practice constantly from Year Up Staff and Employees at my Internship Location

# Why Most Students Fail

They trust Year Up to take care of them.  
**That is the mistake.**

Year Up will not save you.  
They have 100+ new students every few months.  
Old students are not the priority at all.

When I was a student I asked about what happens after internship, I never got a clear answer, just reassurance that I will be taken care of.  
This told me the truth: **there is no plan. You have to take control.**

# Final Advice

Use Year Up for:

* Corporate Skills
* Interview practice
* Work Experience On Your Resume

**Then take control of your own future.**

I (25M) am struggling to move on from someone who has an avoidant attachment style and I’m hoping for advice from people who’ve been through something similar.

I was seeing this girl over the last couple months after meeting on an app. We really hit it off and things were intentional and honestly felt really healthy at first. We had good conversations, thoughtful dates, and moments that felt genuinely connective rather than rushed or superficial.

Around Christmas, her life kind of blew up with family conflict I won’t get too deep into and I tried to be supportive without pushing, mostly just listening and letting her know I was there. When we did talk about it over coffee on New Year’s Eve, it really felt like we were on the same page. But after New Year’s, she completely ghosted. I sent a text just asking if she was okay and she never responded.

I’m working thru anxious attachment and waited a few days before sending one final message setting a boundary for myself basically saying I understand if she needs space, I just would’ve appreciated knowing, and that I enjoyed getting to know her and wished her well. Nothing.

That silence has honestly been harder than a clean rejection. What’s messing with my head is there was no crystal clear explanation or ending that indicated I did something “wrong.” It feels like the connection just evaporated the moment things started to feel emotionally real or stable.

Logically, I understand that avoidant attachment can look like shutting down, disappearing, or pulling away when intimacy increases esp. during stress. Emotionally, though, I’m hurt she couldn’t just let me know she’s okay even if she didn’t wanna continue things and I’m stuck replaying everything and wondering how I overdid it, if I was too supportive or if I should’ve done less.

I’m not trying to “get her back.” I know you can’t chase avoidants into clarity. It just sucks when someone equates closeness to a loss of freedom or self and being as far away as someone pushes you but i’m imperfect and in that fracture is my humanity so I’m trying to get get unstuck because part of me keeps hoping she’ll eventually come back or explain and I hate how much power that gives someone who isn’t choosing me.

So my questions:
	•	How do you actually get over an avoidant connection when there’s no closure?
	•	How do you stop personalizing the silence?
	•	How do you stop your nervous system from staying in “waiting mode”?
	•	And how do you forgive yourself for caring when it feels like caring pushed them away?

Any perspective, especially from avoidant people or who’ve dated one, would really help.

1q8exr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1q8exr9/dont_think_i_ever_did/,Don’t Think I Ever Did,"’m posting this partly to vent, and partly because I need to know I’m not losing my mind.

Three months ago, I got out of a very complicated relationship. From the outside, it probably looked “difficult but normal.” He was controlling. The more I stayed quiet, the more he took over. When it ended, I didn’t feel free — just empty.

So I decided to reset everything.
New city.
New apartment.
New number.
New life.

I rented a small, quiet apartment where no one knew me. The first couple of weeks were hard, but once I settled in, I started to feel okay.

That’s when the small things started getting strange.

During the first week, I woke up one morning to find two coffee mugs on the kitchen table.
I live alone. I hadn’t had any visitors.

I told myself I must’ve forgotten. Stress does that to you.

The second week, after a hot shower, I noticed something on the bathroom mirror. Finger marks in the steam — like someone had written a word.
I couldn’t read it clearly. I wiped it off and didn’t think too much about it.

The third week is when I couldn’t ignore things anymore.

I was cleaning out my phone — deleting old messages, trying to fully move on. That’s when I realized something terrifying:

There were no messages from my ex.
No arguments.
No apologies.
No breakup conversation.

We had texted for months. Even if I deleted them, there should’ve been something. A backup. An email. A trace. There was nothing.

And yet… some nights, my phone would vibrate.

No notification.
No call.
Just vibration.

One night, I pulled out a notebook I’d been keeping since the move — something I used to “organize my thoughts.” Toward the last pages, my heart started pounding.

The handwriting was mine.
But I didn’t remember writing any of it.

“If you’re reading this, you’ve forgotten again.
You can’t go back to him.
He isn’t real.
And neither are you — the way you think you are.”

There was a date at the bottom.

Yesterday.

I didn’t sleep that night. The next morning, I went downstairs and asked the building manager about the previous tenant. She gave me a strange look.

“This apartment’s been empty for three years,” she said.
“The last woman who lived here… had your name.”

I laughed nervously. Thought it was a joke.

Then she added,
“The police came once. She kept reporting messages she had sent to herself.”

Back in my apartment, my hands were shaking. I went to the bathroom and looked at the mirror.

This time, the writing was clear.

“You never knew him. But he created you.”

That’s when everything clicked.

I didn’t leave a complicated relationship.
I was what remained after it erased me, piece by piece.
This “new life” wasn’t new at all — it was a loop I kept restarting.

And here’s the real twist:

Those phone vibrations aren’t from him.
They’re from me.

Reminders I set so I wouldn’t forget.

But every time…
starting over feels easier than remembering.

https://substack.com/home/post/p-182729765

For five years, I have called Broken Arrow home. I chose this community for the same reasons many of you did: the quiet streets, the safety of the parks, and the simple joy of taking my daughter to see the Christmas lights at Rhema Bible Church during the holidays. I used to comfort my family by telling them that the hostility we sometimes saw online wasn’t our reality. I told them those voices were far away, hidden behind screens. I truly believed that here, in our neighborhoods and local shops, we had each other’s backs. I felt grateful to live in a place where we were free to be ourselves, as long as we were kind to one another.

My Fridays have a very specific routine. I drive 25 minutes to the mosque in Tulsa—which, as any parent knows, can be a long trip with a toddler. If you’ve ever tried to pray with a small child, you know the struggle. Kids are kids and so I spend much of our time at the mosque trying to calm her while she just wants to explore and play. It is a workout, but it is our special time together. On the way home, we always stop at a local coffee shop for her ""kids' coffee""—a smoothie she looks forward to all week—and then we head to the grocery store to tackle my wife's list. My daughter insists on asking the employees for stickers and hands out high-fives to every person she sees. The people I see there are the people I have always considered my community.

When I heard a second mosque might be built here in Broken Arrow, I was overjoyed. I know how badly it is needed. What better news could there be than a place to worship closer to home? I took my wife and daughter to the public hearing regarding the mosque's rezoning request with the Broken Arrow Planning Commission, excited to witness a milestone for our civic life. Instead, I walked into a traumatic experience that I am still struggling to process.

Sitting there with my family, I listened to speeches filled with hate, insults, and even threats of violence coming from the very people I live and interact with every day. These weren't anonymous strangers on the internet; these were people I say ""hello"" to on the street, people I volunteer with and for, and people whose businesses I support. I felt physically ill. How can I look at my neighbors the same way today? How can I walk into those same stores knowing that behind a neighborly smile might be the person who stood at that podium and attacked my faith and my family’s right to exist?

Suddenly, my social media feeds are no longer about community news; they are filled with local voices posting pictures of firearms with captions like “problem solved.” It feels like a direct threat to our safety. I find myself wondering if we are truly safe when we step outside our door.

We are just a normal family. We want the same rights, peace, and security for our children that every parent in Broken Arrow wants. I never imagined that so many in the place I called home would see my family as a ""problem"" to be solved rather than who we are and our contributions to this community—as neighbors to be valued. I want people to know that behind the politics and the noise, we are just parents, trying to enjoy a smoothie and receive a sticker, hoping for a kind word in the town we love.",39,1767980643.0,tulsa,10,0.85,False

\-LA Kings 3-Way ML (+125) | 0.5 Units



**Why This Pick?**

I can’t believe I’m saying this, but the Jets are currently the worst team in the NHL. And, not only has Winnipeg lost 4 of their last 5 meetings with Los Angeles, but they’ll also be playing this encounter on the tail end of a back-to-back. Having gone 11 straight games without a win (oof…) I just can’t bring myself to put money on the Jets in their current from. Now to be fair, Los Angeles hasn’t been anything to write home about either, but they’ve won 2 of their last 3 games – both victories being over the very capable Minnesota Wild. Give me the Kings to bag a win in regulation on the road for a nice return.

 I (23 f), am living with my mother (60 f) again and we are both crafts people by profession. Over the winter holiday I have made myself a big merino wool shawl that I needed to block/stretch, so this afternoon I washed it, wrung it out and wrapped it in a towel so that it would stay damp and I would be able to block it in a few minutes. I set the bundled up towel on a chair in the living room for a few minutes while I made myself a cup of coffee. I saw my mama come into the living room and reach to pick up the towel with my shawl in it (I often ask her to hang my towels out on the washing line as I am a wheelchair user and can't reach it) so I say ""oh please leave that, it's my shawl"". She got very upset and told me that that was a terrible way to someone and that it made her feel like I was accusing her of doing something wrong. I was/am very confused by this and asked if she could explain why it made her feel like that so I could better understand? She just kept repeating that that is the impression it gives and that it's the way you would ""speak to a naughty child"". I could see this was getting nowhere and was seconds away from turning into a big a argument, so I apologized to her for hurting her feelings and that that is never something I would do intentionally but that I that I was not going to admit that I was in that wrong for how I spoke because I really couldn't see how I was. She then said ""if only for once in your live you could except that I have more life experience than you"" and that most people would be upset to be spoken to like that. I asked if maybe it could be a generational difference as most people I know speak to each other using that kind of phrasing and it's not a problem. She then said that there is no point to trying to help me learn to communicate as I clearly don't want to hear anything she is saying so there is no point in even bothering. I responded that I was trying to have a meaningful dialogue but that I was not going to sit there and be spoken to like that. I then went to sit in my room for a few minutes to regulate and when I came back downstairs she has locked herself in the kitchen. 

I am honestly so torn because I stand behind everything I said at the time but she is so upset and I am feel very guilty now, so aitah? 🖤

I (30F) saw a guy in the 'standouts' section of hinge a few weeks ago. Im not gonna go into detail about how much i like this guy on paper bc that is irrelevant, but needless to say I was determined to make a connection. 

Naturally, I didnt have any roses left so I thought his profile woukd eventually filter into the regular feed the next day(s) like they often do. But it did not. 

So yes, I did some searching to see if he might be online elsewhere. No FB or IG (which is where I have, I the past, slid into DMs vis hinge before) but he did have a LinkedIn. 

I did NOT wanna come off like a creep. We had 2 mutual connections and a common non profit interest. I sent a connection request expressing this and he accepted. 

We exchanged only 2-3 messages in conversation, focused on the nonprofit.  I was the last one to send something.  I had asked about his involvement with the org/why he joined, ect. Something that was personal and showed interest. That was about 2 weeks ago (before the holidays).

Now my predicament is, I dont want to seem pushy or desperate, but id like to steer the convo in a direction where maybe we could meet for coffee or something one day. Or at least guage interest if hed be open to that. (Hell, for all i know, he could have deleted his hinge bc he got a gf after I saw his profile that day lol.) 

Theres a chance he maybe not be interested at all and that is totally fine. I guess id be remiss if I didnt at least try. (Why is that expectation that only men should be shooting their shot?)

Anyway, just looking for advice on if anyone has had a similar experience -- maybe a success story going this route-- or advice on how to proceed.

I def dont wanna scare the man off. 😅 Are men generally flattered when a woman initiates interest?

I have this stain, which is 3-4 years old. It’s a white laminate kitchen countertop.

I am an adult from the USA. 

My cat (Suki, 1.5 years old, female, spayed) has been throwing up semi regularly recently and it's been worrying my wife and me. 

Once day in early December she threw up three times back to back (clear vomit) and then slept for about an hour or two. Guess she was exhausted from the vomiting. Then she got up and started acting normally. 

A few days later (on December 10) she threw up again (two times back to back in the morning. I think this time it had some semi-digested food) so we took her to the vet that evening. The vet didn't see anything wrong but gave her a Cerenia injection (anti-vomiting) and she was fine after that. We even drove to our hometown over Christmas break and had no issues or vomiting for the rest of December. 

This week though (first week of January) she started throwing up again. First on Sunday morning then again on Tuesday and then this morning (Friday). The throw up is now light brown (like milky coffee) or has chunks of food. 

Could she have a sensitive stomach and isn't enjoying her dry food? We feed her Purina Pro Plan Complete for adults but she's never really loved it too much. She used to love the Pro Plan for kittens but once she turned 1 we switched her over (this was around last August). We also feed her wet Sheba Perfect Portions and she absolutely loves these. We are considering changing her dry food to the Pro Plan for sensitive stomachs. Also thinking of changing the flavor from chicken to lamb or turkey. 

She's been normal and playful other than the vomiting so thankfully that's a positive. 

Also she's known to play with hair ties and string. Back in early October she swallowed some thread but has been fine since then. Could she be throwing up because of a blockage? 

Should we consider taking her to get an ultrasound or something? If so, when or what signs should we look for?

We can afford vet care.

1q8erzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1q8erzs/put_your_phone_away/,PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY,"A few months ago I noticed something kinda messed up. I was just overstimulated as fck all the time. Any tiny pause in my day and my phone was already in my hand and it got me tired at a point.

The worst part was how uncomfortable silence felt. Simple moments like waiting in line, walking or sitting alone for a minute felt extremely hard to do nothing. I always had that FOMO, so I would often check my phone in those times.

So I stopped trying to “use my phone less” and tried to fix my attention instead. I started watching podcasts (Cal Newport) and reading books (Dopamine Nation) that helped me get some ideas and methods to combat this addiction I had.

First thing, no phone for the first hour after waking up. No scrolling, no msgs, no news. Just coffee, moving around, letting my brain boot up. First week sucked. After that, mornings felt way less chaotic luckily.

Second, I only pick up my phone for one reason. If I open it to reply to someone, I reply and put it down. No reward scroll after. Sounds stupid but this one broke the autopilot loop hard.

Third, I replaced fast dopamine with slower stuff. Long walks with no podcast. Music without doing anything else. Writing random thoughts instead of checking apps. Way less exciting, but my brain calmed the fck down.

Fourth, I got clear on what I actually want to work toward. Once I had something real to build, scrolling felt way less tempting. Using some apps helped me organize goals and focus on real progress.

Fifth, I pushed all the fun to night time. If I wanna scroll or watch dumb videos, fine. Just not all day. Knowing it’s there later makes it easier to not reach for it constantly.

At first everything felt boring as shit. Then slowly focus came back and now I can concentrate easily (obviously in tasks that I like haha)

Don’t think I am monk now and I don’t scroll anymore. I still scroll sometimes. I still waste time. But now my phone feels like a tool again, and that’s a relief for me. That alone changed way more than any productivity trick I ever tried.

I know there are a lot of these ""Topo to 3D Model"" apps out there, I see them shared often as new projects and there are already a lot of paid versions that are pretty robust. I am a maker and a tinkerer and this was originally intended to be a learning journey to explore getting an app up and running online. This is my third app, but my first online, hosted, and available to people other than myself. A very fun exploratory project.

I built this app using primarily Antigravity with Gemeni 3 Pro. It uses:

* Database (and other servises) - **Supabase (love using this!)**
* Core - **React, TypeScript, Vite**
* 3D and Graphics - **Three.js, React Three Fiber**
* Mapping - **Leaflet**

Things I think people will like about this app:

* Free
* Secure - email pass authentication is managed by supabase!
* Data collection - your saved maps, your OpenTopography API key - that's literally it.
* **(Almost) Real time model viewer and editor!**

There are still bugs, and there are still model generation improvements to be made. There are a lot of features that could be added...

“Yaar, Aman, life feels so boring after the exams!” I said as I was munching down a whole chocolate bar like a little rabbit, the summer this year was at its peak! According to some news channels you could even melt if you stood more than 15 minutes in the sun! We had just finished the board exams and preparations for getting into college were going on.

We were half-way through the gate of the society when a Black Mercedes roared past me.

“Mind your road asshole!”I snapped instinctively, stepping back.

The Mercedes stopped near the lobby, the passenger door flung open and a girl stepped out of the car, wait a minute! Was that Shreya?!

She was the girl I had a massive crush on back in high school! I had never once talked to her! she was the type of girl you could only look at! You would keep a safe, self respecting distance from! Too out of your league! She was this cool, rich kid who had her own seperate group, the sorts you see in Bollywood movies(Student of the year types), or the American school dramas!

She stepped out of the car wearing this white ribbed tank top and denim shorts, hair tied in a messy bun. Looking all gorgeous. I never realized my jaw had dropped to the floor, the chocolate bar fell from my hands and so did my self-respect! I had turned red as a ripe tomato! 

 

She was looking at me!

 

The Shreya Malhotra was looking at me!

 

 She giggled as if she had remembered some inside joke, waved at Aman and she left!

  SMACK!

 Aman smacked the back of my head bringing me back to reality.

“Ow! God! Aman!”

“Look at you being all Majnu!”

“You knew she had moved in?!”

“She’s moved in the flat just opposite to yours, she’s been texting me for the past week or so getting all excited to move in! everyone knows, I thought you knew,  so I didn’t say anything”

“WHAT?!”

I didn’t hope things would get such dramatic so quick! I mean yeah, I did say the days were going as bland as some British cuisine, but I never thought things would spice up so quick!

“Great! Can’t even go back to my own house now! UGH!!”

I looked up at my flat, gulped, thinking of every possibility, everything that could go wrong!

Aman laughed.

“Chill yaar, everything will be fine! Chal, need to go now, you coming for the match in the evening right?”

“Yeah” I sighed.

Our society had two wings, Aman lived in the B wing, and well you guessed it right! I lived in the A wing. The lift had some maintenance going on, so I had to take the stairs. Well there is a reason I don’t take stairs quite often you see, I live on the twelfth floor!

I don’t think I ever really talked to Shreya during all of school. Maybe once during this group project where, by some miracle, we ended up in the same team. I barely spoke. she barely noticed. The whole week I spent more time rehearsing sentences in my head than actually saying them to her. We exchanged Instagram handles at the end, just like everyone else in the group but when she followed me back a few days later, I stared at the notification for way longer than I should’ve. for me, it was a big deal. For her, probably just a click.

Somewhere between those memories and my heart pounding against, I arrived at my floor, my legs had almost given up, by that point I couldn’t even make out which muscle was hurting the most. I stepped into the lobby of my floor, and there it was, 1205, ‘The Malhotra’s’ etched on the name plate elegantly. Aman wasn’t pulling my leg after all.

A small smile crept across my face, the girl I had dreamed about every night, someone I spent my every waking hour wanting to be with, now lived across the hall. The universe works in funny ways sometimes. I rang the bell of my house, and stepped inside.

\* \* \*

RING!!!

It was Aman, I picked up the phone.

“Hey! You remember today’s caféwaala plan right?!”

“Yeah?”

“Yeah, so... Shreya asked if she could join us. I couldn’t say no.”

“But... why would she want to? And how does she even know? ”

“I told her. We were chatting, and I mentioned the plan. She said she wanted to come along. I mean good for you, I guess.”

“Wow!” I rolled my eyes

“I *said* I couldn’t say no! Anyway, dress nicely this could be your chance! ”

Typical Aman laughter followed.

“Well, Its not like I have a choice!”

“Be ready by six then. ”

 

Then he hung up the phone.

 

This was just three days after she had moved in. And, of course, she was close to Aman. They had been great friends since the third grade as far as I can remember. I tried not to think too hard about that.

 

I had reached the café wearing a nice crisp white shirt, tucked in, sleeves rolled up, grey trousers, black loafers, and my favorite black watch, my go to outfit when I wanted to make an impression.

 Just as I was about to open the door, I saw Aman and Shreya walking towards me.

 

Shreya looked effortlessly elegant in her soft blue linen shirt, half tucked into off-white straight cut jeans, with clean white sneakers which cost probably more than all my monthly expenses combined. A delicate silver pendant with a half-moon rested against her collarbone—maybe it meant something to her. Her hair was tied back in a neat low bun, and she carried a tan leather sling bag that didn’t scream designer but whispered good taste.

 

She looked gorgeous. I couldn’t take my eyes off her.

 

They were laughing about something, probably some inside joke. I started feeling like an outsider looking into something too warm, too natural.

They spotted me and waved. I waved back and smiled, stuffing my nervousness into my pocket.

Inside, the café was relatively quiet today. There were no more than two or three couples in the café. We found a table by the window, Aman taking a seat across from me, Shreya sliding into the chair beside him.

 

Shreya and Aman mostly did the talking. I hopped in where I could, tossing in a joke or two, and maybe a comment here and there. But, mostly I listened. This was the first time I saw Shreya from this up close. She had these perfect almond shaped eyes. I always fell for those, heck I could feel myself drowning in those right now. The way her eyes lit up everytime she talked about something she loved. The way she laughed when Aman landed a joke. The way she tucked her hair behind her ear as she talked. The way she would smile. Everything felt unreal. I fell for her all over again.

 

At one point, she looked at me and asked something I completely missed the question completely, too caught up admiring her.

“Sorry, what?”I blinked.

She smiled.“Aditya, You okay?”

“Yeah, yeah. absolutely!”

I gave an awkward smile, sipping my coffee quickly. It burned a little.

Okay?! I was absolutely stunned. And awkward as hell now. First the chocolate bar incident, and now this! God, she must be thinking I am such a fool!

 

It was about seven thirty now. We had left the café and were near the appartment gates.

“Aadi come home” Aman said , “ we’ll hang out, play fifa for a bit”

“Done!”

“Am I not allowed?” Shreya made a puppy face.

“No, nothing like that….” Aman tried to defend

“Chill, I was just joking! Anyways! I will leave you two girls alone!”

She burst into laughter as she walked ahead.

 

This wasn’t a one time thing. This went on. She would pull his leg, he would try to defend, then I would join in. Aman was our scapegoat everytime we hung out. Poor guy! But that gave space for Shreya and me to bond. After all, we had a common target.

 

Days turned into weeks. Weeks into months.

 

The clear summer skies were now slowly taken over by the dark heavier clouds, and so did my life, the carefree summer days after the twelfth standard boards were now replaced by days worrying about which college to go to. The lazy mornings were swapped over by counseling sessions, The afternoon gaming parlor visits were now made into nervous college discussions over lunch, evening was now full of filling college forms, confusing cut-offs, and regretting every life decision and long discussions with parents that went nowhere.

But amidst all the chaos, the three of us had become a nice little trio. All thanks to Aman. Shreya was no longer just this unattainable crush from school.

She was a friend now, someone more than a friend maybe. But not a best-friend yet.

 

On Saturday’s or Sunday’s, whenever we found time, we used to sit by the chai stall sipping the most magnificent cup of chai I had had in my seventeen years of life or so. It was a small little tea stall, like every typical one. But, the aroma of tea would fill the entire street, the scent of cardamom would lift my mood.

Like every other weekend we were sitting at the tea stall.

“Aadi, you remember Rujuta from our class?” Shreya asked, scrolling through her phone.

“Yeah?”

“See, she just posted this story with her boyfriend”

Shreya showed me her screen.

 “And what am I supposed to do with that?”

Aman’s phone rang, he didn’t pick up.

“All of us thought you had a massive crush on her, you used to be around her all the time”            She teased.

Thank god she thought this. Atleast she didn’t know I have a crush on her.

I glanced at Aman. He shrugged.

“God! She was just a friend!”

“Hmm, then whom did you have a crush on?” Shreya threw me a curveball.

 Aman’s phone rang again.

“Pick that phone up for God’s sake Aman!” I snapped.

“It’s ma” he said. “ I dont know what she wants.”

Aman picked up the phone.

“Haan ma?”

We watched as his expressions changed, his face turned pale, his voice went hollow. His hands shivered as he hung up the phone.

“Hey… Everything all right?” I asked.

“It’s Grandma…”

“What about her?”

“Her blood pressure dropped this morning, doctors have admitted her in the ICU, she’s not been able to gain consciousness…”

 He was barely holding himself together.

“Hey, hey. She’ll be alright,” Shreya said gently, reaching out to him.

“Hope so,  Anyways... we have to leave. The train’s in two hours. I need to pack.”

“Aman, stay in touch,” I said. “And if you need anything, anything, just call.” 

 

We walked back to his home. No one spoke a word. Shreya and I helped him and his parents pack. It was quiet inside Aman’s house. A house always filled with laughter was silent today. It was a silence that crept under your skin. Silence where even the walls seemed to know what had happened. Silence where even the floorboards thought twice before squeaking.

We then left. It was just me and Shreya on the stairs.

“He’s always been close to his grandma.” I said.

Silence hung in the air.

“Never have I seen him this miserable. It just hurts to see him like this.”

“I know” She sighed  “We did the best we could to help him.”

“I just hope everything gets better.”

We had reached our floor. Her and I parted ways.

 

It was about three in the morning. I was sitting on the wide window ledge, knees tucked, arms draped loosely around them, my head gently resting on one of my knees. It was a full moon day. The blue hue of the moon almost lit my dark room. The city skyline looked beautiful from there, light from only few houses were lit, rest everything was quiet. Peace. I had my headphones on, some 60’s bollywood love song was on, but it hardly mattered. All I was thinking of was her.

Notification on my phone went off. 

Shreya’s message.

‘Dumbo? You still up?’

“Dumbo”. Yeah that was the new nickname she had given me.

‘Yeah.

Typed it. Deleted it. Typed it again and hit send.

Three dots appeared. Then stopped. Then came back again

‘Thinking of someone? 😂’

‘Thinking of all the ways you’ve tortured me. 😂😂' I teased.

‘😐😐’

Three dots danced for a while then went away.

‘😂😂, Anyways, Ice-cream today?’ I asked.

‘Only if you pay for it ’

‘😑fine Be ready by 7 then’

‘Ok😁’

God! That same grin again. She was ready to meet that was more important. I thought to myself.

‘Gtg now! feeling sleepy’

‘Bye!’

‘Good night!’

‘Yup!’

‘Byeeeeee!’

‘Gn!’

(The left side are all Shreya’s messages and the right ones are mine.🙂)

I stared at the screen. Smiled at myself for how madly in love I was. Then went to sleep.

 

It was finally seven. The whole day I had been anticipating this, every hour felt like a day. I stood by the apartment gates. Fifteen minutes late there she was. Watching her come out of the lobby felt as if the time time around her had stopped. The sorts you see in Bollywood movies! Ok maybe I am getting too cliché here. But I swear to god that is how it genuinely felt!

“You’re fifteen minutes late! I already feel bad for your boyfriend to-be” I burst out laughing

“Whatever!” She said rolling her eyes. “Let’s go now!”

 

*Naturals* Ice-cream was our stop. It was a relatively small store, but it was just below our society, so can’t complain. It had these two benches outside. Generally they were filled with couples. Today they weren’t. I stepped inside and ordered for two scoops of *Coffee Walnut Ice Cream,* her favorite flavour.

“AADI!! Thats my favourite flavour! You knew?” She squeaked. Almost like a little girl.

“Not really. Just saw a new flavour. I thought maybe we could give it a shot.” I flustered.

 

   We stepped out of the store, almost sat on the bench that’s when a dog stood up and ran away barking, Possibly chasing another dog. Shreya instinctively grabbed my arm. I felt my heart beat shoot up. I was possibly even blushing like an idiot at this point. Maybe she didn’t notice. She Sat down and took a bite from the ice cream. Acted like nothing had happened.

“You were hoping it was Rujuta instead of me, weren’t you?”

She teased.

“Huh?”

“I held your arm. You were hoping it were Rujuta weren’t you?”

“God! Not that girl again!”

She burst out laughing.

“You are pathetic! Anyways call Aman. Let’s check if he is still alive”

She laughed a little. The notification on her phone went off.

I called Aman. He didn’t pick up the phone the first time. Typical Aman. He called right after. Shreya slid close to me, her shoulder touching mine.

“Hey!” She said. “How’s dadi?”

“She’s conscious now. Things are looking ok at best”

There was some background noise

“Anyways, how are you two weirdos together?”

“Just out for some ice cream.” I said.

“Oh. Okay. I need to leave now. I am in the hospital. I’ll call you once I am home.”

He said. Then hung up. You could sense the hospital chaos through the phone. It was best to leave him alone.  
  


Shreya and I chatted for some time finished our ice creams and left. Something felt odd though. The notifications on her phone went off several times. She had mentioned she never kept her notifications. Said they made her anxious or something. What was this then? Maybe I was just overthinking.

I went home. Had my dinner and went out for a brisk walk. Called Aman. To my surprise he picked up the phone.

“I just finished my dinner. I was about to call you.” He said.

“I need to talk to you about something.”

“Yeah. Go on!”

“I think I should confess.”

“What?!”

“Yeah. I think there is some chemistry. Like today for instance, she literally grabbed my arm and acted as if nothing happened! Even teased me about it! She comes with me for late night walks sometimes. At times she even texts me first! She doesn’t take hours to reply, not like the other girls.”

“Maybe thats because she is just your good friend Aadi. Think about it. It could cost us our friendship.” He said calmly.

“I have thought about it. I have thought of everything, every possibility. You know how big of an overthinker I am. I guess it is time. Maybe I will regret it if I don’t do it now.”

“Well in that case my friend, all I can do is wish you luck. Just don’t do anything stupid. Anything that would break our trio. Make her feel awkward around you.” He remarked.

“Yeah.” I let out a sigh.

“Let me know what happens tomorrow then!”

“Yup. Bye! Good night! Take care.”

“Yeah. Good night!”

He hung up the phone.

 

I sat on a bench staring into nothingness. The park felt different today, oddly silent. There used to be people around this time. No one today. Aman was right, what if she says no? what if it costs me the friendship? I tried not to think much about it. But then again, any and every thought seemed to lead me there. I pulled out my earphones, started listening to my playlist. The girl I’d thought of as unattainable, unreachable, way out of my league was somehow one of the closest friends I had! And I was going to confess her the day after! I felt somewhat guilty, on one had Aman was stressed as hell, on the other I was about to take one of the biggest decisions of my life! But then again, maybe this was the right time.

 

  The notification on my phone went off.

   ‘Shreya  
cant come tomorrow…..going out with parents for a week😭😭 ’

  
   GOD!! She was going out for a week! I immediately called Aman to let him know, he said not to worry about it, said she’d be fresh after the trip or something. I didnt have a great feeling about it. It all seemed as if he knew something I didn’t and he wasn’t telling me, his tone on the phone call was different this time. Something I couldn’t ignore. I got up and went towards the lobby.  
  
 There was some noise in the background though I couldn’t make out what it was. The air around me began to smell foul. It almost smelled like the phenyl used in hospitals. As I approached the lift, I felt something drag me back. I was not able to pickup my feet. The noise grew louder. It began to sound like the beeping of hospital machines! I tried to pull myself in front. Trying to break somehow, anyhow! The CCTV monitor started looking like the hospital ECG machine. I sensed something. I turned around.  
“WHAT?!!” I saw something I shouldn’t have seen. 

  
\* \* \* \*

A WEEK LATER

 

“Aadi, you look like you’ve seen a ghost! You haven’t spoken a word since we’ve got here?”

“It, its just…nothing” I muttered  
  


We were on the terrace of our building. It was a big terrace, almost whole of the city visible. Shreya and I used to stroll here after dinner, because there was usually no one there at that time. This was one of those days. It was me, Shreya and the silent night. The stars and the moon lit over us. But Shreya seemed to overshine the moon. I was the star beside my moon, close, yet too far. She wasn’t distant but not very far either. She had her hair tied in a messy bun today, that made me fall for her even more.

 

“You wanted to talk about something?” Shreya broke the silence.  
“Yeah, I actually wanted to talk about it for a while now”  
“Go on,  I am all ears”  
  
“Ok, so, dont kill me please! this might sound a little out of the blue, but, shreya, I’ve been liking you for a while now, I might even have fallen in love with you now, I have you in my mind every day, every minute of that day I spend thinking of you, how beautiful your eyes are, how lovely your smile is, how lucky that damn mirror is to see you everyday! I find my peace when I am with you Shreya, you feel like home! You feel like this safe little corner from this pathetic world! Your eyes are the most beautiful thing in this world that I have seen till date! I just had to get things off my chest Shreya, or I might have regretted it, I love you! And I respect whatever your decision will be”  
  
Silence. I thought I fucked up.  
“Woah! well that is out of the blue, I wasnt expecting this now! what were you doing for the past months! I am leaving for the US in two months for god’s sake! Could you not have done this earlier Dumbo!!”  
“So…does that mean a yes?” I asked nervously.  
“Yes! Yes I love you!”  She hugged me. “But, how are we going to manage things? Long term relationships don’t work! And besides! we are going to be having different time zones! Could you not do this a bit earlier dumbo! I am going to kill you for this!”  
“Wait, but, Why didnt you tell us that you were leaving?”  
“I was going to tell you guys, my visa just got approved this morning, it was going to be hard to tell you guys, I was not sure what to do” she said, I could read the sadness off her face.  
“Its alright! We still have two months! Cheer up!”  
  
The notification on her phone went off, at first I ignored it, it went off a couple times more, I couldn’t overlook now.  
  
“Hey what’s with the notifications? I always thought you kept them off”

“What notifications?” she looked a little confused “See there are none”  
  
She showed me her screen. And guess what! There were none! How could I do this! But I did hear something! What was that then?!  
  
“Aadi! We’ve just gotten into the relationship! Atleast trust me for a few days”

she burst out laughing.  
  
The next few weeks were the best I’ve ever had. Aman had returned by then. We would hangout, nothing much had changed, but Aman always complained about being the third wheel. But it felt too good to be true, and then there were inconsistencies, why were there no notifications on the screen, I had heard the notifications, and also, what was that a week back, my parents told me that the neighbours found me unconscious on the ground, near the lift, but I remember taking the stairs home, I even though I saw shreya for a moment, only that she looked like she was 25. Nothing added up, I decided not to think much about it.  
  
It was just one of those days. The three of us usually did not hang out on the terrace. But Shreya insisted today. We had to. The terrace was always a beautiful spot. We went there at sunset, the transition from a well lit day to the deepest darkest of night, the hour of sunset. We talked about life, future plans, the colleges we would get into, Aman and I had the same college that man just wouldn't leave my side! I was stuck with him for as long as I could remember! Shreya told us what she wanted to do ahead. The glow in her eyes as she was talking about the things she wanted to do! The excitement in her voice! Uff!! I always loved when she talked about the things she loved!  
“Thats it guys! I have to leave you two love birds alone! Maa’s calling got to go! ”

Aman left.  
  
It was just me and Shreya on the terrace, we were walking holding hands.

  
“Look the moon is looking beautiful today isnt it!”  
“Yeah it is!” I said looking at her.  
“Aadi promise me you will not leave me alone!”  
“Woah!” I held her hand a little tighter “where is that coming from miss?”  
“Just, just promise you wont leave me”  
Her eyes seemed to know something I didnt, I chose to trust it.

“I promise you sweetheart I will not leave you alone!”



Just as I leaned in for a forehead kiss, I heard a loud bang! Something fell! I felt my hand slip from Shreya’s, I searched the area, nothing. I turned around, Shreya was no longer there! She was missing!  
“SHREYA COME OUT! WHAT KIND OF JOKE IS THIS!!”  
Silence.  
  
I searched every corner on the terrace, everywhere I could! She had disappeared into thin air some how! Though I could hear something, it was her phone! The notifications were going of like crazy! Her phone was lying on the ground! This meant she was close somewhere, but the notifications didnt seem to stop, and everyone of those was from Aman, each one a voice note, it seemed to be stuck in a loop! I picked up the phone, tried to search for her, no trace!  
“The damn notifications! SHREYA!! Where are you?”  
No reply, the notifications seemed to annoy me, eating up my brain every second. I decided to open one of those.  
  
“This needs to get to Aadi somehow! Can you hear me? Open your eyes for Gods Sake man!” It was Aman though his voice seemed to be like a man in his mid-twenties. He was sobbing.  
“The Shreya you see there is not real man! Shreya died in a car accident! I shouldve never done this, but I couldn’t see you that vulnerable either man! Get up for gods sake!”  
He began to cry now. I couldn’t understand a thing that was going on! Shreya! How could she be fake?! And why was he asking me to wake up! Where was I then? I decided to continue the voice note  
But all the other voice notes were inaudible, almost like either he was talking to someone or working on some machines, ‘Lucid dream’ was the only word I could make out from the whole army of voice notes he had sent. Was I in a dream then? Where was I? Before I could make any sense out of it, every thing began to move! It sky looked like it was eating itself up! Everything around me seemed to collapse on itself! I tried to run as fast as I could! But couldn’t move an inch! I was drowning in darkness. Everything around me pitch black.  
  
\* \* \* \*  
I was resting on something, it seemed like a bed, but not your regular bed at home, more like something you get in the hospitals. Was it the hospital? I could hear machine beeps, but I couldnt open my eyes, I seemed to have some sort of a mask on. I heard someone coming in.  


“Doctor, how are things looking now.” It was Aman.  
“I am sorry, I cant say much as of now, the car crash was very fatal!” The Doctor’s voice went low, he hesitated for a while I guess, “And as for his wife…I am sorry we tried very hard, but the damage to her brain was very severe, we couldn’t save Shreya…”  
  
I heard the doctor walking out of the room. I heard Aman sit beside me, he cried for a while, and left the room.  
  
Just then. I could feel some tingling all over my body. I could sense my arms! I could feel my legs! I could almost smell the fenyl cleaner of the hospital floor! I tried to open my eyes!

I saw the bright hospital light shining above me! My head felt heavy, maybe it was the trauma of the car accident, I was linked with dozens of cables, hooked with a couple of machines, had an oxygen mask on and what not! Just then I glanced over to the side table!  
  
It was Shreya’s phone! That same pink Iphone! The screen was cracked this time though! I couldn’t stretch my arms, I felt no life in my arms! Shreya was so close yet so far! The screen lit up this time! Same notification! It was just in text form this time though!  
“Bro you have to wake up! We are losing you! Wake up for gods sake!”  
  


I was far too exhausted to make out what was real and what not! I looked up at the hospital light. it seemed like the eternal white light.

1q8eh7s,https://i.redd.it/8i5sw2smvccg1.jpeg,The Fly in the Urinal and the Science of Getting More Done,"[Put a fly in your toilet to become more productive.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinal_target)

Early in my career, I had a job where I would roll out a technical product to the press over in Europe. This was just before traditional media was destroyed by the internet. Different magazines and outlets had extremely rich, capable people who actually wanted to talk to you about your product. Consequently, Europe became one of my favorite tracks, as I would visit any place that had a fairly large total addressable market for whatever I happened to be selling at the time. While I would typically land at [London Heathrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport), one of my regular stopovers was Amsterdam, at the main airport there, [Amsterdam Airport Schiphol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_Airport_Schiphol).

I remember, as if it were almost yesterday, walking into one of the bathrooms on a layover, stepping up to the urinal, and seeing that these knuckleheads had put a fly picture in the bottom of the urinal. It did not immediately strike me why they did this, and at first I just thought it was one of those odd expressions of European humor.

In fact, I remember our sales VP that I used to deal with over there who would swear like crazy, and one time over dinner he explained to me, “Yes, I know use a lot of foul language, but you have to understand, I learned a lot of my English from watching American movies. These words do not mean anything to me. It is simply how I learned to speak English.” So it was just part of the general culture, one of those weird things that happened for reasons I did not yet understand.

But it turns out that was not it at all. The fly on the urinal came about because the facilities manager was being driven crazy by the fact that men would walk into the bathroom and pee all over the floor. The cleaning department’s manager, Jos van Bedaf, remembered his experience in the military in the 1960s, where somebody had placed a dot on a urinal, and the moment you gave men something to aim at, the cleaning required for that urinal went down dramatically. So he reached out to the airport’s suppliers and said, “I want you to put a fly on the urinal.”

It turns out that if you place a fly on a urinal and put it in front of someone who is about to pee, it becomes an irresistible target. It is like, “There is that fly, let me see if I can knock it down.” The cleaning requirements for the bathrooms dropped dramatically. Men who had previously paid almost no attention suddenly became focused on trying to urinate directly on top of an etched picture of a fly. Somehow it tickled something fundamental in their thinking, and it caused a dramatic change, which later became a classic example in [nudge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory), developed by [Richard Thaler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thaler), a key figure in [behavioral economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics).

Now, I hope you have actually read some of the other series, because we have been going through [Atomic Habits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Habits) by [James Clear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clear), and this is part of his overall framework and something that is part of [classical conditioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning). Let me lay out a table just for brainstorming, in terms of some of the things you might change in your environment. And if we are really lucky, somebody like u/plaintxt will throw some more thoughts on at the end of the post.

I would also encourage anyone who has come up with something they have found to be a trigger that gets them going to list it here. It was interesting that, in the formation of this post, I started thinking about how having [multiple monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-monitor) always triggers more productivity. One of the actions that I am taking away from this is investigating how I can take my travel arrangement of my Windows PC and an Android tablet and figure out how to use my Android tablet as a second monitor. By doing this, it allows you to leave part of your work stream queued up so that you can address it. While this is not what I would call a simple nudge, it does feel like part of a strategy that comes from thinking about your environment in a different way, essentially an example of environment design.

|Domain / Goal|Environmental change (what to do)|Primary lever|Why it triggers a response|Quick example|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Food / eating|Put healthiest foods at eye level and front-of-fridge/front-of-pantry; put treats high/low/opaque.|Salience + friction|Choice architecture changes what gets noticed and what’s easiest to grab, shifting decisions without removing options.|Fruit bowl on counter; candy in an opaque bin on a high shelf.|
|Food / eating|Pre-portion “default” snacks/meals into ready-to-eat containers.|Default + ability|Defaults and reduced effort make the desired action more likely when motivation is low.|Greek yogurt + berries in grab-and-go containers.|
|Food / eating|Reorder the “path” through your kitchen so healthy items appear first.|Sequencing + salience|“First seen/first picked” is a common choice-architecture effect (context organization influences choice).|Prep veggies at the front of the fridge; condiments behind.|
|Productivity|Remove high-distraction items from immediate reach (phone, game controller); add steps to access them.|Friction|Increasing the effort to perform an undesired behavior reduces how often it happens.|Phone charges in another room during focus blocks.|
|Productivity|Put the “start cue” for your most important work directly on your desk.|Prompt|The Fogg Behavior Model predicts behavior occurs when motivation, ability, and a prompt converge; adding a prompt helps trigger action.|Open notebook + pen on top of keyboard at end of day.|
|Productivity|Make progress visible with a scoreboard (checklist, kanban, streak tracker).|Feedback / reinforcement|Frequent prompts and visible progress support repeated behavior and follow-through.|Whiteboard with “Top 3 today” and check boxes.|
|Focus / restoration|Add direct or indirect nature exposure (window view, plant, nature image) near the work area.|Attention restoration|Attention Restoration Theory proposes natural scenes restore directed attention via “soft fascination.”|A plant beside the monitor; desk facing a window.|
|Focus / restoration|Design a “micro-break station” (chair near window; no screens).|Prompt + context|Stable, repeated context cues help make breaks more automatic and restorative.|2-minute gaze-out-the-window break after meetings.|
|Exercise|Put workout gear/shoes at the doorway or in the visual center of the room.|Salience + prompt|Making the cue unmissable increases the odds the prompt appears at the right time.|Shoes and jacket by the door; bike on a visible rack.|
|Exercise|Reduce setup time: keep equipment assembled and ready.|Ability|In FBM terms, increasing ability (making it easier) reduces reliance on motivation.|Resistance bands hung on a hook; mat already laid out.|
|Exercise|Temptation-bundle: pair workouts only with a favorite podcast/show.|Reward pairing|Bundling adds immediate reward, increasing follow-through on the target behavior.|“Only listen to X podcast while walking.”|
|Household tidiness|Put “return homes” where items naturally land (hooks, trays, bins at point-of-drop).|Friction reduction|Organizing context to match natural behavior reduces effort and increases compliance.|Key tray by entry; laundry hamper where clothes are removed.|
|Household tidiness|Make the desired target irresistibly “aimable” (like the urinal fly) via a visible target/mark.|Salience + gamified cue|A salient target converts a vague goal into an immediate, engaging action cue.|Tape “landing box” on counter for mail; target sticker inside trash bin lid for wrappers.|
|Personal finance|Auto-default good choices (auto-transfer, auto-invest) and require extra steps to undo.|Defaults|Defaults strongly influence outcomes because many people stick with the pre-set option.|Automatic weekly transfer to savings.|
|General habit building|Anchor a tiny action to an existing routine trigger (“after I X, I do Y”).|Prompt + ability|Prompts plus low-effort actions make behavior more likely to occur consistently.|After coffee starts brewing, do 5 squats.|
|Work culture / teams|Make social proof visible (public commitments, shared boards, visible norms).|Social influence|Structuring the context (including social context) shifts behavior via norms and expectation cues.|Team “done” board in a shared space; opt-out rather than opt-in for standups.|",1,1767979640.0,StrategicProductivity,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

So I had this idea from an inspiration of a true story with an ex of mine. It's something that isn't as depressing as what I usually write (which is a good thing) and one of the good memories I have with her way back when. So if you're looking for a feel-good wholesome talk of coziness then here it is\~

I guess after some of the audios I've listened to lately, I have appreciated having a nice chat that isn't usually after something bad happened but before. Something that people might need to hear from time to time or just to sit and have a different outlook on life. Because some like having those deeper conversations that aren't just surface level about how things are. So take a step away with me on this script and let them ramble for a bit 💜

Summary/Script:

You wake up one morning to a day off of work after a long night. It’s a particularly rainy day and your partner has already left the bed to make some coffee for themselves. You have no plans, and they have no work until the evening, and so the two of you spend a nice, cozy morning out on the porch to watch the rain. With warm drinks in hand, and the perfect weather, [you find it safe to reflect and appreciate all the smaller parts of life when things aren’t completely busy (Scriptbin with guide).](https://scriptbin.works/s/4jm84)

Inclusivity Notes:

There are no gendered ""endearments"" for the listener.

{This script is spoken mainly in a slower, cozy/comfort tone}

 

\[Low background rain\]

 

\[Light footsteps\]

 

(soft) Hey.

Good morning, love.

 

(slight pause)

 

I kinda snuck out to make some coffee for myself.

Didn’t want to wake you up too early.

 

\~

 

Did you want one too?

Or maybe some tea?

 

\~

 

(gentle) Yeah, sure.

I’ll go make you some.

 

(pause)

 

\[Light footsteps\]

 

\[Mug placed on counter\]

 

(sigh)

 

\[water boiling\]

 

(calm) Did you sleep okay?

I know things have been a little stressful lately with what’s been going on.

I can only imagine that your rest has been all over the place.

 

\~

 

Well that’s good, at least.

It could definitely be a lot worse.

But you don’t have work today, right?

 

\~

 

I’ve got a shift to get to tonight.

But that also means I’ll be free for little while.

So, I figured I’d have a little lazy morning and see what happens.

Plus, it’s raining right now, so it’s not like I need to go anywhere if I don’t want to.

 

\~

 

\[Liquid pouring\]

 

Yeah, I didn’t know if you could hear it.

It’s not too heavy or anything, so there’s just little patters on the roof.

Nothing too serious.

So I thought maybe I’d just take a step out onto the porch.

Maybe watch the rain for a little bit.

 

(pause)

 

(slow offer) Did you want to join me?

 

\~

 

(soft) Yeah?

Well then, here.

We can take these outside with us.

Just be careful with how hot it is.

 

\~

 

(chuckle)

 

(lighthearted) Yeah, I guess I should have told you before I handed it to you.

But I didn’t overfill it, and I even dropped some ice in so that it’d cool down quicker.

Is that alright?

 

\~

 

Good.

Come on, sweetheart.

 

\[Light footsteps\]

 

\[Door opens/closes\]

 

\[Slightly louder rain ambience\]

 

(pause)

 

(lax) Which seat?

Right or left?

 

\~

 

Alright I’ll take this one then.

 

(sighing sit)

 

(pause)

 

At least it’s not too cold out, either.

Feels almost like the perfect weather, don’t you think?

Well, minus not being able to go out into the rain.

But the wind isn’t blowing it onto us,

And the sun’s behind the clouds,

So it’s not bright out.

But it’s not super dark either.

We can just sit and exist here,

(gentle) Watch the rain brush against the trees,

See the little squirrels running around in the grass,

And this coffee feels so warm, I don’t even think the little chill matters.

(slower) It’s so nice, isn’t it?

 

\~

 

(sigh)

 

Yeah

 

(pause)

 

(soft / introspective) I was actually at work the other day,

And this one guy asked me when I wanted to start opening up a chain of shops around the area.

Which I guess it’s a fair question considering the popularity.

But it got me thinking about it a little more.

I mean, I know I probably could in a few years or so.

Maybe even longer if I wanted to wait.

But honestly, what’s the rush, you know?

I’ve already done so much to get where I am now,

So I can do what?

Shoot full speed into the next huge project?

I feel like if we always did that with everything, then we’d never actually appreciate where we are now

Like, sure, maybe I want to get there someday,

Or maybe I won’t get there at all,

But right now, I know that I’m at least happy with where I am.

 

(slight pause)

 

What I’ve managed to do.

Since my shop has been doing pretty well with sustaining itself,

I guess I have no regrets.

I’m not really in any rush to make it into something bigger than what I initially envisioned.

I just want to be content for a while.

 

(pause)

 

Sometimes people can have a continuous, gradual growth, like these trees.

Or maybe they’ll even bloom at their own pace and stay still for a while.

Life isn’t always about rushing from one thing to the next,

And I don’t think I really want to be the person that breaks their back by never knowing when to slow down.

 

(pause)

 

The world can try and spread whatever propaganda they want about trying to be the best version of myself,

But I think the best version of me is the one that exists today.

I mean, no other version knows as much as I do,

Or has been through what I have.

But, no other version is imperfect either.

So, what would be the point in rushing if it’s just for some superficial life we’re “supposed” to find value in?

Honestly, I’d much rather walk comfortably at my own pace than chase someone else’s image.

And if that comfort is managing my little shop every day,

Making people smile,

Then I’m completely fine with it.

You know?

 

\~

 

(chuckle)

 

(awkward) Sorry, kinda rambled on a little bit.

I’ll stop if it’s bothering you.

We can just sit and enjoy the rain if that’s what you want.

 

\~

 

(unsure) Are you sure it’s fine?

 

\~

 

(lax) Alright, alright.

 

(longer pause)

 

(sip)

 

God, that never gets old.

 

\~

 

Oh, just when you mix this weather with a bit of a warm drink.

It can be calming in its own way.

Makes you realize just how precious these little things can be.

 

\~

 

(gentle) Well, there’s always natural change happening.

But we’re always so focused on other things that we never get to really appreciate it.

 

(slight pause)

 

(introspective) A lot of people go so long without savoring what’s around them and what they have,

And some can’t ever seem to slow themselves down.

Life for them is a race to get somewhere before death,

But what’s the point in killing yourself to reach money and status when life is meant to be enjoyed?

Existence in itself is just the gift of presence.

But if you’re never present, then it can almost feel like a waste sometimes.

 

(slight pause)

 

(soft) Sure, I get when people have to work a lot to put food on the table,

And they can get enjoyment from making sure their family has a good life,

But if you never take any time off, then it can really shift your existence.

Not that it’s a terrible thing every time.

People can just be wired differently.

But,

 

(slight pause)

 

It’s times like these where I can sit and enjoy the rain that things really fall into perspective.

You get to see how nature manages to interact with itself.

How it feeds and replenishes and flows on its own cycle.

Meanwhile we’re just living around it.

We can say that we’ve conquered so much of nature and the Earth itself,

And yet, we haven’t even scratched the surface.

The ocean is mostly unexplored,

The land beneath us is untouched,

And no matter how much we tear into the world around us, it always seems to fight back.

We’re simply just…

Co-existing.

 

(pause)

 

\~

 

Yeah.

Yeah, I guess we’re kind of like nature, too.

We all want to survive one way or another.

Create a better existence for other generations and raise our kids right,

But by that same logic, we can also be passive and live just to exist.

I shouldn’t need to prove anything to anyone so long as I simply survive.

And by the end, I can say that I don’t regret anything.

Because I valued the time that I had, and I appreciated my surroundings.

I’m satisfied with where I’ve come thus far, and where I’ve been.

So now I just…

Want to be at peace.

 

\~

 

(lighthearted) No, I wouldn’t say that I’m completely at peace.

There are still problems that we have to deal with in everyday life.

But at the very least, I can still tackle them knowing that I’ll survive and live another day.

The world will keep spinning,

And I’ll watch it for as long as I’m able.

With whoever wants to be there with me.

(gentle) I’m just glad that you’re one of them,

Whether or not we manage to last forever.

Because I will always be glad that we met.

That we’re here now to enjoy these little moments,

And I won’t regret a single thing.

 

(pause)

 

Would you?

 

\~

 

(soft) It’s fine if you don’t want to answer that right now.

We can never know everything, including how the future might turn out.

But, I’d rather if I didn’t hold onto any long-lasting regrets

Because I wouldn’t be the person I am today if I hadn’t met you,

And I quite like the experiences we’ve had together.

The lessons I’ve learned.

It’s made life pretty fun and memorable thus far,

Even on the bad days,

But if we only held onto malice every day of our lives,

Then we’d only be wasting it by keeping ourselves focused on something that wasn’t worth our time in the first place.

So I’d say it’s better to hold onto people more fondly.

 

(pause)

 

(slight awkwardness) Not to say that our emotions are the easiest to control.

(concern) But it would be a lot better as a whole if we were all allowed to feel them as they were,

Instead of pretending they didn’t exist for the sake of how we looked for someone else.

If we all just felt it and let it be,

Then we could find that time and space to pay more attention to the better things in life.

(gentle) Like you.

Like the little squirrels.

And like the rain hitting the trees.

 

(pause)

 

(sip)

 

Life has so, so much to give us by simply existing,

But it’s been turned into such a race for competition that the meaning begins to blur somewhere,

And it turns into something that it’s not.

 

(slight pause)

 

But what’s the point in turning this cycle into a hell,

When everywhere can just be a little piece of heaven.

 

(slight pause)

 

(chuckle)

 

(lighthearted) I must sound like something out of a fairytale.

“Life is all sunshine and rainbows”, am I right?

 

(pause)

 

(sigh)

 

(concern) But it’s not.

And I know that it’s not.

There’s so much that should change, and it’s nearly impossible for any one person to do it on their own.

Some people even put up a fight for their entire lives only to be shut down by a higher status.

I get that life isn’t fair for everyone.

People aren’t all created equally or have the same capabilities,

But we all share the common thread of existence.

(softer) One that can be appreciated to some extent or another.

I mean, I still have bills to pay and work to go to, and family drama of my own,

But I can at least say that today feels so peaceful.

The rain sounds gentle and nice.

(light joy) And even if it’s for a minute, I want to settle into it and enjoy what it is that life brings.

I want to revel in the experience of existing as I am.

To be able to observe my surroundings without judgement.

Live in the soft brush of the air.

Smell the muddy soil below the grass.

I want to be able to see the light gray skies that pour sustenance onto nature…

For however long that I can.

Because every moment,

Every second,

Is one where I can breathe in the world and be content with where I am,

And what I have in front of me.

 

\~

 

(pause)

 

(soft) So long as you’re sitting here with me,

I don’t mind if you say everything, or nothing at all.

Just having you here is a gift in and of itself.

 

(pause)

 

(sip)

 

(gentle) I know that some people are afraid to sit in the silence,

Especially with someone else,

But once you start to settle into it, it’s not so bad.

You can sit and slow your mind down for a bit.

Have no expectations for one another.

We can watch the raindrops fall and touch the ground,

Be a little more steady, even,

Because it’s alright to not be 100% all the time.

You need to be able to rest too without living for constant energy,

And sometimes that requires you to turn your brain off a little.

Lean back in a chair.

Sip on a hot drink.

And waste some time on a cozy, quiet morning.

Because you’ll realize that this time was never really wasted at all.

You were existing for the sake of existing.

All so you can be recharged for whatever comes next.

 

(slight pause)

 

(soft) It’s how we were meant to be,

Even though some people have developed a defense mechanism around it.

I know they can see silence as dangerous.

It makes them freak out a little bit because they don’t know what will happen next,

Or they don’t like the thoughts in their head.

And if that’s you, too,

Then I’ll be here to hold your hand and guide you through it.

Because I think you deserve to slow down too.

You deserve exist, at least, in the voice of nature.

Where the rain hits the trees,

And the leaves flutter in the wind.

Where the pinecones and acorns fall into the grass,

And the bushes crackle around small animals.

 

(pause)

 

(gentle) I think there are definitely moments where these sounds alone are all we need,

Because it reminds us of how we can simply exist without expectation.

How we can co-exist with the entire world.

And how life’s experiences can be so peaceful despite everything else.

 

(slight pause)

 

These little things can sometimes remind us that we don’t need to move at the speed of light to find our worth,

Or to find value in this life,

Because we are worthy enough by just existing here in general,

And enjoying the presence of life itself.

 

\~

 

(chuckle)

 

(lighthearted) Sorry,

If I talked your ear off too much this morning.

I think that’s all I really had to say.

It’s just that the man the other day really got me thinking about it too much,

And I realized how content I really am with life as it is,

Even if I do or don’t make more shops down the line.

None of that really matters, so long as I lived for the experience.

 

(slight pause)

 

I’m at least happy with how far I’ve come since I started working,

And I think, at least for now, I deserve to rest and appreciate the present.

To let everything sink in and flow slowly like nature’s cycle.

So, I guess if you don’t mind it.

We can just sit here in the silence and let the rain go,

Because I personally love the way that it sounds today.

1q8ecxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Timerun/comments/1q8ecxk/timerun_chapter_1_cold_war/,Timerun - Chapter 1: Cold war,"Nilu considers herself a cold person. Never aloof in a social interaction, but rather ""cold"" as in the condition of feeling cold — which was not helped one bit when she moved to Toronto, Canada back in 2016.

Come 2020, the stubborn part of her still refuses to accept the fact that she needs layers to stay warm. Instead, she has grown a keen eye for thermostats she can dial up.

Alas, life comes with many obstacles.

The thermostat in front of her sits protected in a locked plexiglass box mounted on the worn, and quite outmoded, pink floral wallpaper of the conference room. Her conference room. The large windowless space full of arranged foldable chairs and tables, reeking of the smell of mildew and old coffee.

This is supposed to be her day of the year to shine — her bonus birthday. The “Tapestigators” society she leads is supposed to greet curious conference visitors who find this room. She is supposed to walk around with a beaming smile on her face telling everyone about the mystery their society is just about to solve.

Supposed to.

The silence in the room pulls on her eardrums. She prefers silence over pointless arguments about why the crowd hasn't come. It's too little, too late.

“Nilu, can I talk to you for a second?”

Nilu grabs the thermostat cover with her cold fingers and rattles it, completely ignoring Greg. He is the society's secretary sitting at a desk near the middle of the room with his back hunched after hours of sitting behind his laptop.

“Not even responding!” Says Greg to Yana who is sitting on the desk with him. There are another five people scattered in the room, minding their own business – or at least, pretending to. Everyone wears a t-shirt matching hers with the print: ""Who is Tapestry? Join the Tapestigator society to find out.""

All except for Yana. Not being a common fixture of this society, she is in her usual outfit of flip flops and hemp-fibre pants, paired with a loose tie-dye shirt.

“I wouldn’t have responded either if you had called me a tyrant,” says Yana calmly. She is tagging along as Nilu’s new roommate, so her alliance is clear.

Greg blows air out of his nose and puts down his glasses in an act of frustration.

The lock of the plexiglass box is not elaborate. Earlier in the morning, Nilu combed through the conference for a key, or any proper tool to open it. Yet, at Tapconf 2020 — a conference attended by no less than 4,000 people — she hasn't found anything better than her hair pin.

She leans down on the box and shuts one eye. For what could be the tenth time, she jams her hair clip into it.

“It… was a question, not a suggestion. Genuinely! Whatever I suggested was… being shut down so I just asked ‘is this a tyranny?’” says Greg in a defensive voice. His hands motion anxiously in the air, “I-I’ve always followed Nilu’s lead… willingly. J-just wanna know if I can have input.”

Nilu slightly pulls the hair pin out of the lock and gives it another wiggle. She hears a click. Then… nothing happens.

She doesn't mind the fiddling. Apart from an excuse to not be in the conversation, it's calming to do something with her hands instead. To have a purpose so within reach.

Then there is the other thing.

The less she talks the less she has to worry about blurting out the secret she is keeping from Greg and everyone.

As if she jinxed being outside the conversation, there is another attempt to pull her in, this one she can’t ignore.

“Greg says he didn’t mean it, Nilu. Wanna talk?” says Yana.

""What's that?"" Nilu plays along. A casual response with no hint of resentment in her voice.

""Nilu I just….""

Greg speaks words but Nilu does not listen to them. Instead, her mind succumbs to the overwhelming feeling of being cold and being trapped. This day should have been the highlight of her year. Then here she is, battling a thermostat lock, and reality.

The frustration quickly bubbles to the surface. She turns around, interrupting him. ""Why is this room so freaking cold? It's the middle of July for crying out loud. I walk the street in a t-shirt. Why are we so miserable here?""

""They must have expected the conference room to be full. So they put the AC on max, not knowing…"" says Greg.

He sweeps his hand in the air to imply the obvious: the conference room is empty, despite having enough space to seat a hundred. The banners and the doodads they put together could entertain twice as many.

""It's that stupid Doyle. Who in the right mind would put us in this frozen hell all the way to the east of the venue? Nobody can find us here,"" says Nilu. It feels like a good place to put the blame. At least, she is not pointing the finger at one of their own.

""But actually, Nilu? I… that’s what I want to tell you,” Greg interjects eagerly, distracting from whatever Nilu was hoping to achieve.

Nilu turns and looks at him. Greg’s back hunches more under her gaze.

“I… wrote you a speech for tonight’s closing remarks, to spread the word. I would have done it myself but… you know how I am with public speaking,” Greg gulps. “We’ll get to spread the message,” he mutters every word with more difficulty than the last..

Nilu is holding on to the belief that the situation is beyond repair, but she can’t deny other people’s efforts. Overcoming her personal reservations, she says silently: “Alright, let’s hear it.”

Greg jumps out of his chair and lifts up his laptop. “Yes! Let me go to the top…” he meets Nilu halfway and hands her the laptop.

Nilu pulls some air into her nostrils. The people in the room turn to look at her.

She starts reading: ""Thank you Doyle for having me here. How are you doing Tapconf 2020?""

“Don’t read it like a text, Nilu. Give… give some excitement,” says Greg sheepishly.

“How are you doing Tapconf 2020?” Nilu retries with faked excitement and a rising tone.

Greg waves his hands upward so that the people in the room make sounds. There are a few claps. Someone lets out a thin “woo”.

Nilu reads aloud:

>We all remember when the first song emerged; back on the chaotic internet of 2005—an edgy, wild place belonging to the outcast voices, still largely untouched by commercialization.

>That year, a website went online: MegaUpload.com. Between its debut, and eventual seizure by the US Department of Justice six years later, it became a haven for pirated media. Anonymous users burned through their dial-up connections, trading contraband music in the shadows.

""Way to set the scene, Greg,"" says Yana nonchalantly. ""T-thanks"" says Greg, unsure if that was a compliment. People in the room start to gather around the table.

Nilu continues:

>Amidst all the chaos, there was one song no one could trace. Despite its soaring popularity, it didn’t seem pirated from anywhere. Its description simply read, ""Tapestry - Japanese Droids Approaching The Wild Heart Of Life,"" followed by a string of nonsensical alphanumeric characters.

>The description seemed irrelevant to the song itself:

>The future's under fire

>The past is gaining ground

>A continuous cold war between

>My home and my hometown

>The rock song was a searing homage to immigration struggles, performed by a male vocalist, backed by electric guitars, drums, and subtle audio effects. Its quality suggested a professional studio production.

>People obsessed over it, dissected it. Some online users even claimed to be ""Tapestry,"" but none could back up the claim.

>Soon, a new song surfaced, bearing another mysterious title: ""Tapestry - The Whale Said Unpatriotic Things,""

“Gosh, I love that song,” says one of the Tapestigators enthusiastically; Others nod in agreement.

>…and the songs keep coming, leading up to this very conference.

>Each of you remember where you were, how old you were, and what pirate website you were not supposed to be on, when you discovered Tapestry.

People laugh. “This is beautifully written!” Remarks Nilu as she gives Greg an impressed look. Greg shrugs and flashes a smile. The excitement is apparent in Nilu’s tone when she continues.

>Since his first song, Tapestry has continued to inspire us, soothe us, and elevate us with his music. Every year, his music is played more than the next ten music artists combined.

>Still, one question remains unanswered: Who is Tapestry? And why does he stay anonymous?

>We are the Tapestigators and we won’t stop until we find answers.

For the last sentence, Nilu leans forward, makes her voice more commanding and articulates every word. The Tapestigators start clapping unprompted this time. The woos are louder.

>Tapestry! Maybe you are here in this room. For all that you have given us, our society is on a mission to tell your story. Please come forward.

>And for the rest of you, you can find us at the eastern room of the venue. We may not have yet discovered who Tapestry is, but with your help, we are closer than ever. This year we…

Nilu stops and frowns. There is nothing else to read.

“That part we have to fill in,” says Greg. ""Nilu, you can say we… uh, we are on track. We… did so and so; made so much progress.""

""How did you?"" asks Yana.

""Did… what?"" asks Greg.

""Make progress.""

""Oh! We, uh… are here! We… came here…""

""Yeah, I see that. But when you say that, the audience will want to know how that keeps you on track,"" says Yana.

Greg’s mouth opens. He lets out a vowel before giving up and  looking at Nilu to take over.

Nilu stays silent. She puts down the laptop and looks around, scanning the circle for anyone brave enough to tackle Yana's fundamental yet uncomfortable question. They stare back so she looks away.

Nilu doesn't even know whether her own life is on track, let alone this tired search for a mysterious artist. With these thoughts, almost like a reflex, her lips pinch together and her hands go into the pockets of her cargo pants.

Then her right hand feels something that makes her freeze.

That secret.

Everybody in the room would want to know what’s on the sticky note in her pocket. Besides, she never kept anything a secret from these people. So why not share it now and make everything easier?

Weighing the thought for another second, she comes back to her original conclusion. If she tells them, their first question will be ""how did you get the sticky note?""

The answer would be too compromising, if not self-incriminating.

Nilu quickly brushes off the thought as if she is worried someone can hear it in her head. Ending the awkward silence, she pulls out her hands and blurts out: ""To tell you the truth…"".

This is the filler phrase Nilu uses whenever she is about to tell a lie.

""It’s the experience. Most of us have been looking for years. Way before all those other groups at the conference even existed. So we know we are getting close"" says Nilu, avoiding eye contact.

She can tell her fellows are unsatisfied — deflated even — by this vague statement. So it isn't a surprise when Greg protests in his sheepish way.

""But actually, Nilu? I realize… Yana has a point. We need to show some progress and… a plan for the future. Those… other groups plan ahead,"" Greg's slightly shaking finger rises to point at the door to the double-doors of the conference room. From beyond it they can hear the sounds of a large, yet distant, crowd.

""Doyle asked everyone where they wanted to be stationed. He said first-come, first-served. The Rite was on it, they got the best spot. If we had a plan…"" says Greg. Again his eyes nervously jump from one face to another, looking for any sign of interest.

Nilu rolls her eyes. Mentioning their rival group, The Rite, was the wrong move.

She starts rubbing her forehead and closes her eyes, talking slowly and firmly to overrule Greg. “All we need is something for the end of the speech. Like… maybe we have door prizes or something.”

Motivated by this new thought, she opens her eyes. ""We need to make some news that spreads in the conference like wildfire."" She claps her hands, straightens her posture, fakes up her excitement. ""Let’s start with the first person who walks in. We give them…?"" Nilu looks inquisitively at the group, waiting for someone to finish her sentence.

""A spot in my upcoming Tantric Alpha Awakening Firewalk,"" says Yana casually.

Just as Yana finishes her sentence, the squeaking sound of the door echoes in the room. Everyone looks on to find two men frozen in their steps, the door slowly closing behind them.

""Oh, so timely,"" Nilu bounces up. ""Hello attendees to the Tapestigator room!"" She says loudly with amped up excitement.

She awkwardly pushes some chairs out of the way, strutting towards the men. Before reaching them, she briefly turns her upper body to flash a thumbs up and a wink to Yana.

""Good news!"" Nilu tells the men. ""We have a first-attendee prize today! Which one of you walked in first? I think it was you? Anyways, that lucky person gets a free spot in uh…"" Nilu turns her head towards Yana again.

""Tantric Alpha Awakening Firewalk,"" Yana says loudly.

""That,"" says Nilu, then she goes silent for an answer, her eyes shifting back and forth between the men.

""Oh,"" says one of the men after a long pause. ""Is it online?""

Nilu frowns. She looks at Yana to fill them in.

""No silly!"" Says Yana. She gets up and approaches them. ""Tomorrow around midnight we will come out. We follow the howling of the wolves into the wild. I'd say we stop when we are at least two hours away from any civilization. Then we will torch some charcoal to…""

The men look at each other.

""I'm actually sure you were the one who walked in first,"" says one of the men to another.

""Um… no!"" The other man gulps. ""It was because you opened the door for me, so technically it was you.""

""Still you stepped in first""

""I know! It's very exciting!"" says Nilu, trying to grab their attention again.

""That doesn't matter, your hand came in first.""

""It does! See if I open the door and exit…"" the man leaps towards the door and opens it again,

""No! Let me tell you…"" the other man runs behind him to exit the room.

""Wait!"" Shouts Nilu. ""Let's not worry about the semantics…"" Nilu's voice trails off as the door squeaks to close behind the men.

Silence falls.

""Nilu, t-that was a… good start. I'm more saying…"" hearing Greg's voice from behind her, Nilu makes a fist. She turns and storms towards him. Talking through her teeth, she keeps her voice down but her tone is cold as a gust: ""we are not going to have a grueling 6-hour planning meeting right now.""

Greg’s slouch intensifies but he holds his ground. They start a silent but heated argument.

Yana turns her head towards the person next to her, Sandeep. ""Did I cause this?"" she asks.

Sandeep breaks his blank stare from the argument and tries to act as naive as possible. ""You?"" he says, followed by a frown and a drawn out ""nah.""

Yana turns to say something to Nilu and Greg. Realizing this, Sandeep throws his hands and body forward to grab her attention. ""Hav-have you seen some of those posters we put up over there?""

He guides Yana away from the argument before she can cause more destruction.",1,1767979379.0,Timerun,0,1.0,False

I met a guy online and he’s from the US but he’s also Filipino, and im here and from the Philippines too. We met the first week of September 2025. We instantly clicked like you know those type of people you can just easily vibe with? And then for about 2 weeks he started to verbalize he’s interested to get to know me and to possibly be his girlfriend. I’m really a cautious person because I don’t trust easily. Let’s just say based on what I have observed, during the get to know phase he is all good like giving me money for coffee or sending me food. I did see he is very expressive about his feelings. However sometimes i feel like he lacks effort. I’m not materialistic but it’s just that there are some occasions where I feel like he could send me at least a flower or anything at all but there’s none. Like where’s the guy that used to be like that? It’s like ever since I said yes to him on December he became complacent although he is still sweet and expressive. He’s going to visit Ph next year. We had one ex and also used to have talking stages. I am NBSB although have previous talking stages as well. Is it too early that I said yes to be his girlfriend or i should not depend in the timeline or months too much?


Also, ever since I made it official, he always wants us to do SOP. I understand it’s the only 
way and a form of intimacy as well since we are in an LDR setup. But it’s too frequent. Even if I’m not in the mood but he is always up for it. It’s really hard for me cause even if i dress a bit provocative im the type of girl that doesn’t engage in online type of sex. What’s your thoughts about this?

1q8e8xt,https://i.redd.it/y92dm3moxccg1.jpeg,Cat throwing up semi-regularly but otherwise normal,"Hey everyone!

I am an adult from the USA. 

My cat (Suki, 1.5 years old, female, spayed) has been throwing up semi regularly recently and it's been worrying my wife and me. 

Once day in early December she threw up three times back to back (clear vomit) and then slept for about an hour or two. Guess she was exhausted from the vomiting. Then she got up and started acting normally. 

A few days later (on December 10) she threw up again (two times back to back in the morning. I think this time it had some semi-digested food) so we took her to the vet that evening. The vet didn't see anything wrong but gave her a Cerenia injection (anti-vomiting) and she was fine after that. We even drove to our hometown over Christmas break and had no issues or vomiting for the rest of December. 

This week though (first week of January) she started throwing up again. First on Sunday morning then again on Tuesday and then this morning (Friday). The throw up is now light brown (like milky coffee) or has chunks of food. 

Could she have a sensitive stomach and isn't enjoying her dry food? We feed her Purina Pro Plan Complete for adults but she's never really loved it too much. She used to love the Pro Plan for kittens but once she turned 1 we switched her over (this was around last August). We also feed her wet Sheba Perfect Portions and she absolutely loves these. We are considering changing her dry food to the Pro Plan for sensitive stomachs. Also thinking of changing the flavor from chicken to lamb or turkey. 

She's been normal and playful other than the vomiting so thankfully that's a positive. 

Also she's known to play with hair ties and string. Back in early October she swallowed some thread but has been fine since then. Could she be throwing up because of a blockage? 

Should we consider taking her to get an ultrasound or something? If so, when or what signs should we look for?

We can afford vet care.

1q8e8sb,https://i.redd.it/ruz8i2cnxccg1.jpeg,random guy started a trash fire and nearly burned down my building,"Sharing this because I’m irritated. 

Woke up \~ 5:30am to thick smoke in the building and alarms blaring. fortunately just some trash cans someone set on fire and the smoke entered the building but no actual structure damage. It’s happened before, but this time it damaged a neighbor’s vehicle. Fortunately a nearby security guard called it in and SFFD responded before it became an even bigger issue. 

That’s annoying and stressful by itself. But I got ahold of photos and videos of the incident and after reviewing them, I’m more irritated. The usual assumption is someone homeless and/or using does stuff like this. And maybe that was the case when this has happened before. But this time footage clearly shows a middle aged white guy, put together, not obviously homeless or using, stop in front of the building to bother someone who probably was homeless, but otherwise not doing anything. He looks at them, looks at the trash cans, rifles through his pockets, then lights a cigarette. He took one more look back at the homeless person, then walks over to the cans and begins intentionally igniting the contents inside with a lighter before quickly walking away. 

In watching the footage, I could see the flames grow to a massive size as the fire spreads to nearby cans and eventually the cardboard recycling. The flames reach the canopy in front of the building just as the fire department shows up to extinguish them. Fortunately no one was hurt, but there’s now 150 people sharing two trash cans and my neighbor’s work vehicle has significant damage. Not to mention all of the stressed out neighbors trying to evacuate their terrorized pets while still half asleep.

I’m sure folks would be quick to blame the homeless and drug users. And maybe this guy fits that description. But what the video I saw suggests is that some random coherent man made a calculated and ruthless decision to threaten the lives and livelihoods of people in their beds or getting ready for the day, and walked away. He knows who will be blamed, even if not that specific person, unhoused people and addicts as a whole. And for what???

For that he slips in a pile of shit as he scurried like a rat down the street. I hope his coffee lids leak for the rest of his life. 

And I hope everyone else has a better morning than we did.

for a long time, i thought i had to make massive 100-page ebooks or 10-hour courses to provide ""value."" but when i looked at my data, nobody was finishing them.

so, i tried a total pivot. i took my entire 4-year WFH productivity system and condensed it into a tight, 11-page roadmap. no fluff, just the ""SOPs"" i use to run my business.

**here’s what i learned from the ""short-form"" product approach:**

* **higher completion rates:** people actually read all 11 pages in one sitting. because they finish it, they actually implement the ""3-task rule"" i talk about.
* **the ""coffee price"" strategy:** i priced it at $4.99. it’s an impulse buy. it’s easier to get 100 people to spend $5 than 1 person to spend $500.
* **focusing on a single problem:** the roadmap doesn't try to solve ""life."" it just solves ""disorganized work-from-home founders.""

moving to a physical office gave me the clarity to actually document this system properly. it turns out, the ""manual"" for your business doesn't need to be a novel it just needs to be a map.

* **As a Lion, As a Rose** (NEW) - *Deep rose, patchouli-steeped black tea, leonine amber, & glowing blood orange.*  Each Midwinter, I try to bring a blend that encapsulates how I'm feeling going into the new year, or how I'd like to feel.

We'll get through this, if we lead with tenacious love, and with collective courage.
* **#DoYouMind** \- Chonky mocha streaked with caramel, cream-white whiskers, & a sassy twist of clementine.  One last round for our beloved Stubbs, who lived a long, lush life, but who was called to the great cardboard box in the sky late last year.

I work in healthcare and reading the room in a second is pretty important - thankfully my ADHD thrives under that stress so I've managed well. During the week, I'm out and about around the entire hospital. On weekends, I manage our department from the office and am a lot more chill. I can dress down, be comfy, work on my little hobbies at the desk (when it's slow, it's hours of downtime). Even when I have to leave the office, the hospital on the weekend is chill and I can go chat in the ER or whatever. Overnight, weekend hospital shifts mean lots of talking and trauma bonding and it's easy to get to know each other. 

Since I began supervising our weekend crew and relaxing a bit more, I've had some very young coworkers show romantic interest. I'm in my early 30s and I've seen plenty of young guys flirt and it's clear to me. The shy 19 year old thanking me for advice and saying how I'd make someone very happy one day and blah blah blah. It's literally shit I remember from high school. None of it will malintent - just silly young boy stuff. ""Can I walk you to your car? Grab a coffee? Can I text you about non-work stuff?"" I literally can think of 7 guys between 18 and 22 who have asked me out at work. And lots of older male patients. But never anyone remotely close to my age. 

I'll preface I'm aro-ace. I don't date, have no romantic interest, and generally keep to myself outside of work. I feel no guilt saying ""nah"" to everyone without making it personal. No one has reacted badly - they are all great guys (I almost said kids - I literally think of them as boys). My brother is their same age and I very much take a sisterly approach to many of them (I've met many of their parents and they say the same - that sounds weird but my hospital is the largest employer in the area and many families work within the hospital). 

I already hate being perceived and I just want to be like ""What about me if even fucking appealing to you? I'm just existing - stop it"". But especially since these guys are so young - I'm doing nothing wrong and it just feel gross (which I suppose is good in a way).

The problem? I have ZERO idea what I’m actually doing.

I tried using ChatGPT to generate a baseline profile, and well… it’s confused. It keeps hallucinating regarding what the sliders actually do. At one point it told me to ""turn the ET up to 85%."" I ignored that because I didn’t want to pay extra on my heating bill this month haha.

Anywho, I’m turning to actual humans. I’ve attached screenshots of my latest roast.

The Beans:

 \* Origin: El Salvador Honey San Luis Bourbon (from the Sweet Maria’s ""Santa Sack"" sample pack).

 \* Label Notes: ""Rustic honey process with deep toned bitter sweetness that gives way to pulpy fruit aspects and acetic hints, unrefined sugar, earthy cacao, and a thick boat mouthfeel (that’s what she said) Good for espresso."" Recommends City+ to Full City+.

The Data:

 \* Green Weight: 255.5g

 \* Roasted Weight: 214.4g

 \* Moisture Loss: \~16.1%

The Weird Part (My Probe?):

You’ll see on the graph that I marked First Crack around 350°F. And yes, that is accurate. I’m consistently hearing the popcorn sounds between 350°F–360°F on literally all my roasts.

I have no idea why it happens so low unless my temp probe is 40 degrees off? It’s a brand new machine with only 18 roasts on it, so that seems wild. All my Google searches have it happening at 380-405 F. So, confused. 

The Struggle:

I’m trying to do everything manually because apparently I’m a glutton for punishment and enjoy being mentally distraught. ""Fail forward,"" or whatever that guy Tony with the big teeth says.

My track record so far is spotty. Some roasts have been decent, but most are either vegetal (grassy) or ashy (burnt). No in-between.

The Result:

This specific batch actually smells good right now…distinct milk chocolate notes. But given my history of ""vegetal or ashy,"" I have trust issues. 

The Question:

Based on the attached graphs, the 16% loss, and my weirdly low First Crack temps, is this roast actually good? Or is my probe lying to me? I know a lot of this is subjective, but I honestly don’t know what to look for on the graph. 

Information is scarce on this machine if you don't know what you're doing, and so is my hair from pulling it out so much. Haha.

My own child plays on the team, as does the child of another parent (also married).

At first, we had friendly, casual conversations related to soccer and everyday topics. From my perspective, this was purely platonic and social. I never had romantic intentions and did not want anything beyond friendly, professional interaction.

Over time, she started messaging me privately more often. Like good morning messages, memes, images with heart symbols, and texts implying she was thinking about me. I always replied politely but kept my responses factual and neutral. I never initiated private conversations or suggested meeting up.

Eventually, she asked if we could meet for coffee. I declined by saying I didn’t have time. She reacted emotionally and said I should just tell her if I didn’t want to. After that, I clearly explained that I am happily married, my family is my priority, and I intentionally keep private relationships within the team environment limited. I said I was comfortable with respectful, relaxed contact strictly in the context of training and soccer.

She said she understood, apologized, and told me she wouldn’t bother me again. A little later, she sent one final message with an image and a text along the lines of: “You don’t always message people you like, but you think about them — and this is one of those moments.”

I didn’t respond, because I felt replying would blur the boundary I had just set. Since then, there has been complete silence, and in person she seems distant.

Now I’m wondering if I handled this poorly by not setting boundaries earlier, or if not responding to the last message was unfair or cold.

Our secrets slowly come out over time. Maybe causing a ripple between us but eventually we can’t stay away from each other because of the love that grew and potentially any other outside reasons we can think of. That causes you to join me in starting my own family and taking everything over.

I was surviving on 4 to 5 hours of broken sleep every night and wondering why my life felt like it was falling apart.

I’d go to bed exhausted around 1am or 2am after scrolling my phone for an hour telling myself I was too wired to sleep. I’d lie there with my mind racing about work stress, things I forgot to do, conversations I had earlier, random anxious thoughts about nothing specific.

Eventually I’d fall asleep around 3am and then wake up at 7am feeling like I’d been hit by a truck. Alarm would go off, I’d snooze it three times, drag myself out of bed feeling foggy and irritable and exhausted before the day even started.

By 2pm I’d be fighting to keep my eyes open at my desk. I’d grab another coffee, my third or fourth of the day, trying to push through the crushing fatigue. That caffeine would keep me wired into the evening and then I couldn’t fall asleep at a reasonable hour and the whole cycle would repeat.

Weekends I’d try to catch up by sleeping until noon but I’d still wake up feeling unrested. I was always tired. Every single day I felt like I was operating at 50% capacity, dragging myself through basic tasks that shouldn’t have been difficult.

My mood was terrible. Little things would irritate me. I’d snap at people over nothing. I had no patience, no emotional buffer between a minor annoyance and my reaction to it.

My focus was nonexistent. I couldn’t concentrate on anything for more than a few minutes before my mind would wander or I’d need to reread the same paragraph five times because nothing was sticking.

I was anxious all the time, this constant low level dread humming in the background of everything. My chest felt tight, my thoughts were racing, I couldn’t relax even when I had free time.

And I was gaining weight despite barely eating because my body was so stressed and sleep deprived that my metabolism was completely broken. I’d look in the mirror and not recognize myself.

I knew sleep was important theoretically but I didn’t realize it was the keystone holding everything else together. I thought I was just someone who didn’t need much sleep, that I could function fine on 5 hours, that sleep was almost optional if you pushed through with enough coffee and willpower.

I was 28 years old and I’d been chronically sleep deprived for so long I’d forgotten what it felt like to actually be rested.

Then I read something that scared me: chronic sleep deprivation has the same cognitive impairment as being drunk. Reaction time, decision making, emotional regulation, memory, all compromised at the same level as if you’d had several drinks.

I was essentially drunk every single day and calling it normal.

I realized every problem in my life, my mood, my focus, my anxiety, my weight, my relationships, everything was downstream from the fact that I wasn’t sleeping. And I wasn’t going to fix any of it until I fixed my sleep first.

So I committed to 60 days of actually prioritizing sleep like it mattered more than anything else. No compromises, no excuses, sleep became non negotiable.

It was the hardest and most important thing I’ve ever done.

What I actually did

Set a non negotiable sleep schedule

I decided on 10:30pm to 6:30am. Eight hours, same time every night including weekends. No exceptions for social plans or late work nights or wanting to stay up watching something.

The consistency was critical. My body needed to learn when sleep time was. Going to bed at random times between midnight and 3am meant my circadian rhythm was constantly confused.

First week was brutal because I wasn’t tired at 10:30pm. I’d lie there awake feeling like I was wasting time. But I stayed in bed with the lights off anyway, training my body that this was sleep time now.

By week two my body started naturally getting tired around 10pm. By week three I was falling asleep within 15 minutes of lying down. The consistency trained my biology.

Banned screens an hour before bed

This was harder than it sounds. My entire evening routine had been scrolling my phone in bed until I passed out. That blue light was destroying my melatonin production and the content was keeping my brain activated when it needed to wind down.

At 9:30pm every night, phone goes on the charger in another room. Not just face down next to me, actually in a different room where I can’t reach for it.

That hour before bed I’d read, journal, talk to my girlfriend, stretch, take a shower, anything calm and screen free. It felt weird at first, almost boring. I didn’t know what to do with myself without a screen.

But that boredom was the point. My brain needed boring to transition into sleep mode. The constant stimulation had been keeping me wired.

Within two weeks my sleep quality improved dramatically just from cutting screens before bed. I’d fall asleep faster and sleep deeper.

Fixed my caffeine intake

I was drinking coffee all day, last cup usually around 5pm or 6pm, thinking it wasn’t affecting my sleep because I could still fall asleep eventually.

But caffeine has a half life of 6 hours. Coffee at 5pm meant half that caffeine was still in my system at 11pm. I was trying to sleep with stimulants in my bloodstream and wondering why my sleep was restless.

I cut myself off at noon. One or two cups in the morning, nothing after 12pm. The afternoon fatigue was rough for the first week but I pushed through with walks and cold water instead of more coffee.

After two weeks my energy levels stabilized. I wasn’t crashing in the afternoon anymore because I was actually sleeping properly at night.

Made my room actually dark and cool

My bedroom had light coming in from streetlights, my phone charging light, random electronics with LEDs, all creating this ambient glow. Even small amounts of light suppress melatonin and disrupt sleep cycles.

I got blackout curtains and covered every little light source. My room became completely dark, like can’t see your hand in front of your face dark.

I also dropped the temperature to 67 degrees. Your body temperature needs to drop to fall asleep and stay asleep. I’d been sleeping in a room that was too warm and wondering why I’d wake up throughout the night.

The combination of pitch black and cool made a massive difference. I started sleeping through the night instead of waking up multiple times.

Used a structured plan to fix everything at once

I was scrolling Reddit one night looking for sleep solutions and someone mentioned this app Reload that builds 60 day plans. I downloaded it thinking it’d just be sleep tips but it asked detailed questions about my routine and built a complete schedule.

Sleep was part of it but the plan also structured my entire day. Wake time, workout time, work blocks, wind down routine, everything scheduled so it all supported better sleep.

The app also had this ranking system that made progress feel like a game. Every day I completed my plan I’d move up ranks. It sounds silly but that gamification kept me motivated when I wanted to skip the routine and stay up late.

What surprised me was the plan included blocking during the day. It’d automatically block distracting sites during work hours so I’d actually be productive and not need to work late. That meant I could stick to my 10:30pm bedtime instead of working until midnight.

Having the entire day structured around supporting good sleep, not just the sleep itself, made it actually sustainable.

Started exercising in the morning

I used to work out at 8pm or 9pm when I had time, right before trying to wind down for bed. Terrible idea. Exercise spikes cortisol and adrenaline and body temperature, the opposite of what you need before sleep.

I started working out at 6:30am instead, right after waking up. It was miserable for the first two weeks dragging myself out of bed to exercise, but it had two huge benefits.

One, it reinforced my wake time. Even if I wanted to sleep in, I had to get up to work out. That consistency locked in my schedule.

Two, morning exercise made me naturally tired by evening. By 10pm I was ready for bed instead of wired and restless.

The morning workouts also gave me energy for the whole day. I wasn’t relying on caffeine to function, I had natural energy from actual rest and movement.

Week 1 and 2, I felt worse before better

The first two weeks were terrible. I was forcing myself to bed before I was tired, lying there awake feeling frustrated. I was cutting off caffeine early and feeling exhausted all afternoon. I was waking up early to exercise when my body wanted more sleep.

Everything in me wanted to quit and go back to my old routine. At least before I knew what to expect. This felt harder.

But I’d committed to 60 days and I trusted the process even though I felt worse.

By the end of week two something shifted. I started falling asleep faster. I started waking up feeling slightly less terrible. The pieces were starting to work.

Week 3 and 4, I started sleeping through the night

This was the breakthrough. For the first time in years I’d sleep from 10:30pm to 6:30am without waking up. No tossing and turning, no waking up at 3am with my mind racing, no restless half sleep.

Just solid, deep, uninterrupted sleep for eight hours.

I’d wake up and feel rested. Not perfect, not full of energy, but actually rested. I hadn’t felt that in so long I’d forgotten it was possible.

My mood started improving. I wasn’t as irritable. Small annoyances didn’t set me off. I had patience again.

My focus got sharper. I could read something once and retain it instead of rereading the same thing five times. Work that used to take me all day I was finishing in a few hours because my brain actually worked properly.

Week 5 and 6, everything started clicking

By week five I wasn’t just sleeping better, I was better. My anxiety had dropped significantly. That constant background dread was gone. My chest wasn’t tight, my thoughts weren’t racing, I felt calm.

I started losing weight without changing my diet. My body wasn’t in constant stress mode anymore so my metabolism started working normally.

My workouts got better. I had energy and strength I hadn’t had in years. I was lifting heavier, running faster, recovering quicker.

My relationship improved. My girlfriend said I was more present, more patient, more affectionate. I wasn’t snapping at her over small things or being withdrawn because I was too exhausted to engage.

Friends commented that I seemed different, more like myself. I was more social, more engaged in conversations, more fun to be around because I wasn’t constantly fighting fatigue.

Week 7 and 8, I felt like a different person

The last two weeks I finally understood what it felt like to be properly rested. I’d wake up before my alarm, naturally, feeling ready for the day. No grogginess, no hitting snooze, just awake and alert.

I had consistent energy all day. No afternoon crash, no fighting to keep my eyes open, just steady energy from morning to evening.

My productivity was higher than it’d ever been. I was getting more done in less time because my brain worked properly. My boss noticed and asked what changed. I told him I fixed my sleep and everything else fixed itself.

My anxiety was almost gone. I felt calm and grounded and capable of handling whatever came up. Problems that used to overwhelm me felt manageable.

I looked better. My skin cleared up, my eyes weren’t bloodshot and puffy, I’d lost 12 pounds, I looked healthy instead of exhausted.

Eight weeks earlier I’d been a zombie running on fumes. Now I felt alive.

What actually changed in 60 days

My brain started working again

Sleep deprivation had been making me stupid and I didn’t realize it. My memory, focus, decision making, creativity, all of it had been impaired.

Once I started sleeping properly my cognitive function came back. I could think clearly, solve problems, remember things, focus for hours. It was like someone turned my brain back on.

My mood stabilized completely

The irritability, the anxiety, the emotional instability, all of it was downstream from lack of sleep. Once I fixed my sleep my mood leveled out.

I wasn’t snapping at people. I wasn’t spiraling into anxiety. I wasn’t feeling depressed for no reason. I just felt steady and calm.

My physical health improved dramatically

The weight loss, the better workouts, the improved recovery, all connected to sleep. Your body repairs itself during sleep. When you don’t sleep enough, nothing works right.

Once I prioritized sleep my body started functioning the way it was supposed to. Hormones balanced, metabolism normalized, inflammation decreased, everything improved.

My productivity tripled

Proper sleep meant I could actually focus and think clearly. Work that used to take me all day because I was fighting through brain fog I could finish in two hours of sharp focused effort.

I got promoted six weeks into this because my performance improved so dramatically. My boss thought I’d figured out some productivity system. I just started sleeping.

My relationships got better

Being rested meant I had the emotional capacity to be present for people. I wasn’t too tired to engage, too irritable to be patient, too foggy to listen.

I showed up better for my girlfriend, my friends, my family. They all commented on the difference.

The truth about sleep

Sleep isn’t optional. It’s not something you can shortchange and make up for with coffee and willpower. It’s the foundation everything else is built on.

Every system in your body depends on sleep. Your brain, your immune system, your metabolism, your hormones, your mood, everything. When you don’t sleep, everything breaks.

You’re not more productive staying up late to work. You’re less productive the entire next day because your brain doesn’t work properly. The math doesn’t work out in your favor.

You can’t catch up on weekends. Sleep debt accumulates and sleeping in on Saturday doesn’t undo five nights of poor sleep.

The most productive thing you can do is sleep. Everything else in your life improves when you’re properly rested.

If sleep is destroying your life

Set a non negotiable sleep schedule. Same time every night, same time every morning, no exceptions. Your body needs consistency.

Cut screens an hour before bed. The blue light and stimulation are destroying your ability to fall asleep. Read, journal, do something calm instead.

Stop caffeine after noon. It stays in your system longer than you think and it’s disrupting your sleep even if you don’t realize it.

Make your room dark and cool. Blackout curtains, cover all light sources, drop the temperature to 67 or 68 degrees.

Find a system that structures your entire day around good sleep. I used Reload which built a complete 60 day plan that included sleep routine, daytime structure, blocking distractions during work so I wouldn’t need to work late, everything that supported actually going to bed on time.

Exercise in the morning. It reinforces your wake time and makes you naturally tired by evening.

Commit to 60 days minimum. The first two weeks feel harder, by week three you start feeling the benefits, by week eight you’re a different person.

Treat sleep like it’s the most important thing in your life because it is. Everything else depends on it.

Final thoughts

60 days ago I was surviving on broken sleep and wondering why everything felt impossible. I was irritable, anxious, unfocused, gaining weight, struggling through every day in a fog.

Now I sleep eight hours every night and everything else fixed itself. My mood is stable, my anxiety is gone, my focus is sharp, my energy is consistent, my productivity is higher than ever.

Two months of prioritizing sleep completely changed my life.

Stop treating sleep like it’s optional. Stop sacrificing it for work or social plans or screen time. Stop telling yourself you’ll catch up later.

Sleep is the foundation. Fix it first and everything else gets easier.

Set your schedule today. Tonight, go to bed at the same time. Tomorrow morning, wake up at the same time. Start the consistency now.

Find a system that structures your whole day to support good sleep, not just the sleep itself.

See what happens when you’re actually rested for the first time in years.

The version of you that sleeps properly is calmer, sharper, more capable, and more present than the exhausted version you’ve been living as.

Rather I have a request for help sourcing a table lamp that had these features:
- led
- heavy base with no cord 
- foldable with a long light bar when unfolded
- battery powered with a replaceable battery pack or an area where AA or even C batteries can be placed 

I do my puzzles on a coffee table in a portfolio (cats) so the heavy base is pretty non-negotiable. So far the only thing I can find are lamps that seem to have lithium batteries and everyone I’ve bought like that has had the batteries fused in so you have to risk an explosion/fire to pry it up or throw away the entire lamp.


I keep the puzzle portfolio folded up on the table when I’m not working on it (unless I have company coming over then I slide it under a couch) so I would prefer that the light fold up so it can sit next to or even under the portfolio when I am not working on it.

I will take any suggestions, even if they don’t hit all of my criteria. I’m just trying to figure out what actually works well for puzzlers and for some reason when I try searching for replaceable battery packs or AA batteries, I just get a sea of lithium battery options which don’t specify if they are replaceable.


(I really wish the right to repair people would make a registered right to repair trademark symbol so we, as consumers, could buy things we can repair now rather than wait for legislation.)

For 4 years, I worked from home. It was ""okay,"" but I always felt like I was playing small. I was doing just enough to get by, but I wasn't growing.

Last month, i decided to bet on myself. I rented a professional office space, and the shift in my mindset has been **incredible**.

**Here are the ""Good Vibes"" lessons from the last 30 days:**

* **The Power of the Morning Drive:** That 30-minute commute isn't ""lost time"" it’s my hype time. I listen to podcasts, set my intentions, and by the time I arrive, I feel like a CEO.
* **Complete Clarity:** I finally sat down and turned all my 2026 goals into a clear, 11-page roadmap. Having a plan feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. No more guessing.
* **The ""Win"" List:** I switched to a ""3-Task Rule."" Instead of a never-ending to-do list that makes me feel guilty, I hit 3 big wins every day. The feeling of checking those off is better than any coffee.

I’m finally treating my work like a career and not just a ""side hustle,"" and the results are showing. My productivity has doubled, but more importantly, **I’m actually happy while I’m working.**

i wanted to share this to encourage anyone else who feels ""stuck"" at home. Sometimes a change of scenery is the only spark you need to start scaling!

These areas tend to be a bit more affordable and have their own personalities yet are very similar.



Plaza Midwood is the fastest growing of the two. If you are looking for a spot that has new restaurants opening left and right, high-end stores like Lucheese, Solidcore, Yonder Yoga, and coffee shops galore this is the spot for you. 

Its a 5 minute drive away from Uptown so it will be a quick community into the city for work or you could bike. There's also a good line street car which you could take depending on which side of the neighborhood you live. Make sure you use Google or Apple maps and see how far away the station is from the apartment you are looking at. 



NoDa is going to much smaller than Plaza Midwood. There's not as much going on and the restaurants/bars in the area are well established. You occasionally see a new business pop-up but its not growing like Plaza Midwood. This is an ideal spot for someone who wants to be close to the city center and have things to do within a short walk from their apartment but not be in the thick of it.



Both locations will still get very busy on the weekends since you are in the city so if you are looking for something quiet neither of these neighborhoods may be for you. Make sure you pay attention to the exact unit you rent because the streets get very loud, the light rail can be noisy and there is a freight train track that runs right through both neighborhoods.



I found out the hard way that the tracks were still active. Sometimes you can get a good deal if you're okay dealing with loud trains at night / throughout the day but be weary. 



Our final recommendation:



If you don't want to pay for parking and need to use the light rail, live in NoDa

If you're looking for something a little larger and has a bit more to do live in Plaza Midwood



Both neighborhoods are fun, lively parts of town and you won't be disappointed with either one.

And they said that the frosting was safe at room temp. However…I’ll take that one step further…

Do you know if cream cheese frosting would be equally as safe as buttercream? 

I’m trying to decide between these:

A regular butter cream with butter sugar and milk (I don’t have any cream today but can go get some if that is the deciding factor). 

Swapping the milk for coffee to have a coffee flavored frosting if the milk isn’t safe. This I know would be totally safe but it isn’t what I want!

A haunted gas station, weird rules, monsters that don’t bother explaining themselves, and a narrator who sounds like he’s running on caffeine, denial, and spite. On the surface it’s chaos. Jokes stacked on nonsense stacked on horror. And more nonsense and then even more horror. 

But there’s something like, oddly grounding about it.

Jack keeps showing up. Not because he’s brave or chosen or particularly hopeful. He’s just there. Clocked in. Dealing with whatever crawls out of the dark because someone has to. That resignation mixed with dry humor feels painfully familiar. It's kind of how I've pushed through my own absurd existence. 

The comedy doesn’t smooth over the fear. It sits next to it. Like laughing at something terrible because that’s the only way to keep it from swallowing you whole. The world is inexplicable and hostile, so you narrate it like a joke and keep the lights on as long as you can. Again, laugh or you'll cry has been a personal coping mantra of mine. 

It’s dumb. It’s smart. It’s strangely tender for something full of monsters and bodily fluids. The horror feels real because the exhaustion feels real.

I didn’t expect it to stick with me the way it did. But it did. It feels like a reminder that sometimes survival looks less like heroics and more like showing up, making coffee, and dealing with the weird shit in front of you. Again, our world is appearing more absurd and monstrous by the day, so the series almost reads like a survival guide.

Why you probably have BFS. 

  
\>You live a stressful life. Work, relationships, money, you name it. Often stress is a trigger for benign twitching.

\>You have vitamin deficiency.

\>You drink too much caffeine and get poor sleep.

\>Twitching feels like pops here and there, that last couple seconds to couple minutes. It rarely stays in the same place for hours, but when it does, don't freak out, that is a hotspot. I've had it few times, longest lasted a full week. Some report even months!

\>You experience different types of twitches. The intensity, location, patterns, all move around randomly. You experience them in every random muscle. Hallmark BFS.

\>You notice them more easily when laying down, trying to relax. This is also hallmark of BFS. 

\>When you try to show them to someone, they are nowhere to be found! And now everyone thinks you're crazy.

Bonus content! 

\>You have no clinical weakness. This means objective, measurable weakness. For example, cannot walk on your heels, lift a coffee mug.

\>You had a normal clinical examination by a neurologist. If there's nerve damage, they catch it. They see this stuff daily, don't think you are the outlier who has the weirdest onset of all time.

\>You had a normal EMG and NCS. No, it was not too early. Needle detects very early denervation, you feel symptoms when denervation is >50%. This won't go unnoticed.

\>You are under 50 years old. Without family history it is super rare at young age. BFS on the otherhand is very common in people in their 20s and 30s. As you see in this sub. Even if you're older, it is very likely benign. 

\>Over 6 months to a year has gone by and you're still doing everything normally. 

\>You gain strength at the gym. Or you have any other hobby that requires mobility and use of muscles. 

That's all I could come up with quick ! Is there something you disagree with ? Let's discuss.

Josh was able to obtain a search warrant for Charles' home and the entire property. Josh executed the search warrant by himself. He wore a body camera which was on the entire time and also a separate video camera. Josh did a thorough but respectful search. When Josh would walk into a room he would sweep the entire room with the video camera then left the camera running the entire time. He left everything just as he found it. As he was leaving the room, he would sweep the room with the video camera again so he couldn't be accused of destroying anything. He searched the entire house and found nothing. 

He went through the garage and the same thing. Josh decided to check the outside buildings. In the garden shed it was the same thing, everything organized and in its place. He walked around the large pool in the back yard to the pool house behind it. It had the mens changing room and one for the ladies with an equipment room in between. He started with the mens side. It had a toilet, shower, and a bench that had a shelf unit that had hooks to hang clothes. Clean again. Then he checked the ladies side. It was much brighter and more plush with larger and padded benches, one by a large full length mirror. He thought it was a girl thing, check your look before you are seen. Then he noticed something. A normal person would have missed it but he had been in enough interrogation rooms to recognize a two way mirror.  He also noted it was an open shower, one that didn't have a door but the floor was sloped to keep the water from flooding the room.
   
Josh next went into the equipment room. It had the pump and the filters for the pool. But there was a four foot wide shelving unit that seemed to serve no purpose. It looked out of  place here, unlike everything else at the property. Josh wondered if it was being used to cover the mirror. He was surprised with how easy it slid away from the wall. Instead of the mirror he found a door. It led into a small room the size of a closet. He was sure that is what it was originally. 

He was right. The mirror gave a clear view of most of the changing room. There was a camera set up that would be triggered with movement. As he inspected it, he realized it was set to capture the changing room and into the shower. Then he noticed a suitcase by the wall. Now that looked entirely out of place. Josh picked up the suitcase and found a spool of rope behind it. He took them outside where there was better light. He recognized the rope. It appeared to be the same rope that was used to bind both Liz and Cindy Ann.  
    
When he opened the suitcase he found a large file box, a ledger, a bottle of what looked to be some liquid medicine, and some papers. When Josh opened the file box it was full of neatly arranged pictures of women that were in the dressing room in various stages of undressing. He noticed that each picture was numbered in ascending order. In the ledger it had a column that had numbers that seemed to match the photos, followed by a date, name, and comments on each. Finally there was what seemed to be a rating system with smiley faces. It seemed to go from a big smile followed by exclamation marks down to a sad face. 

Josh ran down the names. It read like a who’s who of the rich and powerful, or at least their wives. Then one name jumped out at him, Cindy Smith. He quickly flipped through until he found the numbers. The photo just before Cindy's was of Liz. She was bound and dead. When he came to Cindy Ann's, Josh realized he had seen this before although at a different angle. They were the same as the crime scene pictures. Except here Cindy Ann was alive with a horrified look of total terror on her face. Then the next one she was obviously dead. 

Josh ran into the changing room and vomited in the toilet. Once he could catch his breath he washed his face and went back to where he was working. He found the flap where people normally tuck socks and underwear, it was stuffed with cards, letters, and notes. 

It was too much to go through there so Josh was going to take everything back to the office to log it into evidence. Then an envelope caught his eye. It was a legal sized envelope that stuck out a bit. Josh recognized the name on the return address. It was Liz's divorce attorney. Josh read the letter. It was a review of her case including when divorce papers would be served. Charles had to have seen this. If Josh had not still been sick and wiped out from the pictures, he would have celebrated. Instead he simply picked everything up and trudged to his car. 

When Josh walked into the station everyone was asking if he was OK. One person came up to him and jokingly said that he looked like he had seen a ghost. Josh just stared at the floor and said dryly “I have.” 
   
Josh called the DA and told him that he needed to come down. He had too much to bring to him. The DA knew what he was talking about. He dropped everything and ran down there. The first thing Josh showed him was the notebook then pointed out the names and dates for Liz and Cindy Ann. Josh explained that Cindy Smith was an alias for Ann Morris. She had run away from a home that was sexually abusive and took the alias of Cindy Smith. She had introduced herself to Charles as Cindy Smith, but when she was found dead, she was identified as Ann Morris.
 
It clicked with the DA what those dates were. “Oh my” was all he was able to say. When Josh showed him the pictures, the DA's mouth dropped open and he wasn't able to say anything. Josh started sobbing. It took him a couple of minutes to regain his composure. The DA said “It hits you kind of hard, doesn't it?” Josh then showed him the letter from the attorney that Charles had with his papers. All the DA could say was “Holy Smokes!” over and over each time he pulled out something else. Finally they were able to sort through all of it. When they were finished, the DA sat back and said, “Congratulations, you found quite the treasure trove there.”      
   
Josh just smiled sadly and said “Charles had it all stored together. All I had to do was find it. I never would have if I had not spotted the two way mirror.” He then remembered what he was taught back in his training, the smallest details can lead to the biggest clue.    
   
It was all Josh could do to make it home. He just lay on his bed holding the photos of Cindy Ann and Liz. This is how he had to remember them. Alive and vibrant. He would never be able to erase the images he had seen, but this is how he chose to remember them.
    
Josh checked on the bottle in the suitcase. It turned out to be used as a date rape drug. The thing was that the victim would remain fully conscious but unable to move. Josh called the coroner and asked for Liz and Cindy Ann's samples to be tested for this drug. When the results came back, both had it in their system.
    
The spool of rope was sent to the lab to be tested. It was an exact match to the rope used to bind both Liz and Cindy Ann. Josh contacted the manufacturer and found that it was a special order item and all the spools were sent to an outfit on the coast of Maine. 
Josh called the outfit in Maine. They never sold any of it. It was to be used for in-house projects only. The only thing they could figure out is that an employee stole the spool. Josh had no idea how it wound up with Charles but it was good to know that it was not an item that anybody could go into any Walmart in the country and buy ten of the same item. 
    
Josh had accomplished all he humanely could. Now it was up to the judge, the DA, and the jury. Now was the time to let the cards fall where they may. Charles was arrested, but posted bail before he saw the inside of a jail cell. He hired who many considered the best defense attorney in the state. Josh was scheduled to testify so he couldn't attend the trial. That was fine with him. He didn't want to hear all the details again. 

Josh was called to testify and the defense attorney was brutal. He questioned Josh's training, qualifications, his procedures, any little thing that would cast doubt or put him in a bad light. He then asked if Josh had a personal vendetta against Mr. Converse? Josh responded “I never held a vendetta against anyone. I simply try to hold people accountable for their crimes. It isn't my job to judge anyone, which I would have to do to carry a vendetta.”
    
Josh was asked if he didn't hold an opinion as to who was guilty? Josh answered “When these crimes occurred, I was a paper boy, delivering papers every day. So of course I heard about the crimes, the same as every other person in this area did. So if you are asking if I went into this investigation with the preconceived idea that Mr. Converse was involved, all I had heard prior to my investigation was that a transient man was involved. If I had an assumption, it would be I was looking for a transient. To me, Mr. Converse looks nothing like a transient. Actually when the evidence started to point to Mr.Converse, I resisted it. I knew the standing he held in this community. I didn't recklessly pursue accusations against such a man. But when the evidence kept circling back to him I had to follow the evidence. If I didn't I would not be any better than the person who committed these crimes.”
     
The defense attorney then threw him a curve ball. “Didn't Mr. Converse fire your mother from her job at the bank?” It took Josh a second to recover from that. Then he responded with a calm voice “My mother struggled after her divorce. I always assumed that she was fired over performance issues, but I don't know. She never spoke with me about it. I have no idea who fired her. I really never thought that a president of a bank would be involved with the firing of low level employees. But I wouldn't know. I have never worked in the banking industry.” Once the defense attorney realized that he couldn't shake Josh or get him upset, but would just throw it back, he dismissed him.
     
The trial came to an end, and it went to the jury. Charles was still confident that he wouldn't be convicted. The jury surely wouldn't find him guilty. He was sure that he held some of their mortgages. But the jury came back quickly with guilty on all counts. At the sentencing very few people spoke in his favor. Once it got out that he was taking inappropriate photos of women without their knowledge, and it being his buddies' wives on top of that, nobody wanted to be associated with him. 
     
He was sentenced to two life terms without possibility of parole plus forty years for the sexual assault on Cindy Ann, all to be served consecutively. He was never getting out. The defense attorney swore to appeal, but he didn't have a chance with the overwhelming evidence. This crazy time finally was over. 

The DA talked to Josh after the trial was over. The DA told him that during his testimony, he had really won the jury over. But when the jury was shown the pictures Charles had taken, the judge had to call a recess. Even some of the men on the jury were openly crying. The DA thought that was what sealed Charles' fate. Especially the shot he took of Cindy Ann horrified then of her after, both taken by Charles himself. He thanked Josh for putting together such a strong case for him. It made his job so much easier. If he could ever help Josh in any way, just give him a shout.
    
Shortly after the trial concluded, Josh was called into the Chief’s office. When he walked in, the Chief closed the door behind him. Josh could tell the Chief would rather be anywhere but here right now. The Chief was fidgeting nervously, not knowing how to start. Finally he blurted out “Josh, you are one of the best men I have. Actually one of the best I've ever worked with. But the Governor is pissed. He's coming for blood. He is not going to be satisfied until he has your head on a platter. I tried to stand up for you, but it is starting to affect the entire department. I ...”

Josh held up his hand, smiled, and stood up. “Chief, you don't have to say any more. I knew the risks when I started this. Especially when the evidence led the direction it did. That is why I did it all on my own and didn't involve anyone else with the investigation. You can tell the Good Governor that I went rogue or whatever you need to. You can tell him I was disciplined, fired, and I will never work in law enforcement again. I've truly enjoyed my time working with you. You are continuing to make some good changes, but in order for that to continue, you need to stay in your job. I did the job I came to do and now I'm ready to move on.” 

Josh then handed over his badge and service weapon. He felt like a stage of his life was over and another just beginning. He had lived this case for well over a year, 24/7. He never took a vacation or even a day off. When he did talk to anyone, it was all about the case. He knew what he was going to do. It felt like he was finally out from under a huge weight.

The first thing he did was to take flowers to Cindy Ann's grave. He sat there for a long time talking to her, telling her how much he missed her, telling her all about how sorry he was that he hadn't been able to protect her. He then told her that they got the bastard. He is in prison now and would never be able to hurt anyone again. She could finally rest. Josh reluctantly left.

Josh's next stop was to see Jill. He thanked her for lending Liz to him. He was bringing her back home. She belonged with Jill. 
As Josh was leaving, Jill thanked him for what he did. She didn't think she would ever see the day that Charles would be held accountable for what he did. Josh thanked her for showing him the real Liz, full of life and laughter. That is how she needed to be remembered.
     
Then Josh granted the news the interview they had been clamoring for. He gave a brief statement. He started “I want to thank the Chief for giving me the opportunity to come into his department and allow me to follow the evidence to where it led, to someone that callously killed two beautiful ladies. I also want to thank the DA who had the guts and backbone to do what the people of this county deserve, to have the people who do crimes here to be held accountable, even though it may still prove to be political suicide for him. These are the men that deserve your respect and support. Now there are some people at the state level that are very upset that their buddy and major contributor was held accountable for his horrendous crimes. They have come gunning for me and are willing to destroy anyone standing up for me. I'm not going to let that happen. I'm not anyone special to allow them destroy good people. Then I would be just as bad as the despicable person that was rightfully convicted. I came in, I did a job that needed to be done, now it's time for me to slide out. That is all I have to say.”  

When pressed to name who had come gunning for him, he simply said “This came from the highest levels of the state. Don't listen to the speeches fancy politicians give. Watch what their actions are. Not when they are putting on a show for the camera's, but when they are up against the wall. Now the Chief and the DA have shown you what they are made of. I will stand for them any day, even fall for them. But remember this, always follow the evidence, it will lead you to the truth. You may have to dig for it, but it will be worth it. I have already said too much. Goodbye.”

It was finally over. Now Josh was ready for some needed and much deserved rest. He took off to visit his Dad as soon as the press conference was over.By the time the story broke, Josh was flying out to visit his Dad. He wound up spending six weeks at his Dad's. He spent the first week just sleeping. Josh was emotionally and physically exhausted. He would wake up, grab something to eat, then go back to bed. Once in a while he would catch a reflection of what he looked like and stumble into the bathroom and get cleaned up. 
    
After ten days he was finally starting to feel somewhat human. He started to do some things with his Dad. He went into his Dad's office. As his Dad was showing him around and introducing him to everyone, one of the tech guys popped up and almost shouted “Oh My, you're Josh!” Josh said, ""Yes, have we met before?” It turned out that his interview back in his hometown went viral on the Internet, billed as “A Small Town Hero”. The tech guy pulled up the clip and shared it with everyone in the office. No more introductions were necessary. 
     
Josh was a bit embarrassed by it all, but his Dad was very proud, so it was worth it. Even at the store, people would recognize him and give him a thumbs up or want to talk with him. Josh really didn't know why. He wasn't comfortable with the attention. He had spent his entire life living in the shadows and avoiding any attention.
   
He went up in the hills camping with his Dad. It gave them a chance to talk. His Dad asked what he was planning to do now? He had decided to go back to school, finish his Bachelor's degree, and get his teaching certificate. Cindy Ann had told him that he should teach. Maybe it was his way of keeping her legacy alive. Maybe then he could start living again. 
     
His Dad told him that he still had the education fund available. He started it with over $40,000 when the house sold and he added to it over the years. He wasn't sure how much was in there currently. He could access it whenever he wanted. Josh told him that he still had education benefits from the Air Force also. Those had to be used for education so he would like to use that first. Josh decided to stay there and go to the same school he had attended while in the Air Force. He found that most of his credits could be transferred over and he could complete his degree in two years. He got a job at the library and found a cheap room near campus. It kind of reminded him of his studio apartment back home. 
    
He was close enough to his Dad that they could visit often, but not so close they were stepping on each other's toes. His Dad was starting to date which Josh thought was great.
   
While they were camping, Josh told him all about his encounter with his mother. She had been totally consumed by the drugs. Josh said he would have stepped in if there had been a glimmer of a chance, but there was none. Josh had finally come to terms with it.
Josh's Dad admitted that it was difficult to hear and process, but he knew it was true. He had been holding on to the hope that one day they would be able to meet and be together, but that was a fantasy. Maybe it was because he couldn't face being hurt again so it was easier to hold on to a fantasy. 

Josh realized that maybe he was doing the same with Cindy Ann. It had hurt so bad he wished he could have died with her. He actually did to some extent. He had kept the promise he had made. He had found the person responsible and made sure he was held accountable. Just maybe now it was time to start to live again. Cindy Ann would always be a part of his life, but now it was time to let her go.
    
When Josh got home, he took Cindy Ann's picture and stared at it for a long moment. He said a silent goodbye, then gave her a final kiss. He put the picture in the very back of the journal where he had found it, then packed the journal in the bottom of a box and put it in the back of the closet. It felt like closure to him. He knew he wouldn't feel better right away, but over time he would get there. Another circle in his life had been completed.
    
At school one of his classmates recognized him from the news clip. They got along great so Josh asked him what the big deal was, why were so many people interested in what he had said? It just didn't make sense to him. He only agreed to the interview because people were coming after the people that were actually just doing their jobs and not playing games and bowing down to their every desire.
     
The guy was into philosophy so broke it down for Josh. Most people struggle through life facing one set back after another. They really want to tell everyone controlling them off but feel powerless to do so. You not only told off the biggest boss eloquently, but while doing that you gave a huge shout out to the little guys that were actually doing the job of taking care of everyday people, like us. It was like a battle cry for the little people that get crushed every day. 
     
Josh nodded slowly then said “Since you put it like that, yeah, I can see it. I just never intended for it to go like that. I was just upset at the time, I just said what I felt.”
    
When Josh finished with his degree, he decided to move back to his home town. He felt like he needed to take care of one last task. He contacted Cindy's sister, Julie. He told her that he felt he needed to deliver something to Cindy. He wanted to drive there so she and her kids could ride along, if they would like to. He would even let her control the radio. She laughed and said that had been a couple of years since she visited home, so that sounded like a good idea. So they agreed to leave Friday late afternoon then return Sunday afternoon. 
     
Josh pulled up in front of Julie's house at five. When the girls came out, Josh was amazed at how much they had grown since he last saw them. They were turning into young ladies. Josh asked them if they were excited to get back to school. Lackluster responses on that. Then Josh said he was going to school that fall. They didn't believe him. Yes he was, only he was going to be one of the mean teachers. That got the girls giggling. Julie looked over and said he didn't have a mean bone in his body. Josh smiled and said that he was sure he had one or two in there somewhere, they were just well padded.
    
After a short while both of the girls were sound asleep in the back, so Josh started to have a serious conversation with Julie. He asked how she was doing? Honestly. Julie said that the divorce a year ago was rough on everyone. The girls miss having their father around. And she gets lonely. But they are getting by. 

Josh asked if she had ever heard about his background? “I grew up in the typical family. My father was an engineer and my mother worked in a bank after I started school. My parents divorced when I was eleven and my mother started dating a guy right after and he had moved in real quick after that. I would have been fine with that except the man was extremely abusive. Before I was thirteen I left and lived on my own since. Ann had a similar situation. All this to say, please be careful who you bring around your kids. If you need help with the kids I would love to help. When Ann died I died with her. I am just now starting to heal so I need to be around people more. So don't hesitate to call.” 
     
“One other thing, if you start to date, please let me check him out. Ann thought she was perfectly safe and we know how that turned out. I'm just saying, if you are going to open your heart and then have him around your kids, you need to be safe. Some people are really good at hiding who they are. If you agree to that, I promise I will shut off the protective brother mode for the rest of the trip.”Julie agreed then they both laughed.
     
Saturday afternoon Josh got to the purpose of the trip. He brought out the journal and gave it to Cindy. He had found a wooden box that held the journal. He knew that this was more than just passing over an item. It was passing over a life of memories, good times and bad, but it was also a symbol of letting go of the past so he could start living again. He would always carry a piece of Cindy Ann with him, but he wouldn't carry the burden of sorrow, of guilt, and of the overwhelming sadness any more.

That fall was time for elections. Josh talked to the DA and wished him well. The DA asked him to campaign for him. Josh told him he never cared for the spotlight but advised him to focus on what he had done. How he kept his promises and would continue to do so no matter the personal cost. The DA won by a landslide, but the Good Governor who was threatening destruction was voted out. Josh doubted he had anything to do with it, but it did feel like an appropriate ending.
     
As he started the new chapter of his life he started living with new challenges. He chose to teach third grade. He did this because he felt that he could have the biggest impact on the students' lives and their desire to learn at this stage of their life. If he could nurture a desire to learn now, it would benefit them for their entire life. 
     
He always sought out creative ways to teach new concepts and ideas. He didn't want them to simply memorize facts, he tried to help them to understand them. He gave the students Monopoly money during math so it wasn't just abstract numbers on a paper, he found a caterpillar and he brought it in for science and had the students watch as it spun a cocoon then emerged as a butterfly. They then took it to the park and released it. During Social Studies he would have the students reenact events they were studying about.
     
Then he noticed Christi. Actually he couldn't not notice her. She had become very disruptive and was very aggressive with the other students. She was a very bright girl, she did well with her assignments, but her behavior was becoming worse. 
     
Josh noticed that she loved to draw and any art work they did so he asked her to help him with an art project while the class went out for recess. He didn't want to be alone with a student so he asked the teacher from the next class, Jennifer, to be there with him. 
     
Josh started off asking Christi to draw a picture of her family. She drew two larger people and a smaller girl. Josh pointed to the girl in the drawing and asked if that was her. She smiled and said yes. Josh said he knew because she was pretty. At this the girl giggled. He then asked who the others were? Christi said that it was her Mom and Mom's boyfriend. She had drawn them with big frowns. He asked her why they were upset? She said they were always mad at her. They always tell her she is bad. Josh then asked if when he gave her a time out, if she thought that he was thinking she was a bad girl? She said yes. Josh then looked in her eyes and said “That isn't it at all. I think you are a good girl. You just need a chance to get away from the situation for a minute. Did you know that even parents need to get a time out sometimes?” He then asked if she got time outs at home? She said no, paused, and said that they do bad things to her. But they tell her that if she says anything, nobody would believe her. Josh knelt down to her level and looked her in the eye and told her “When I was about your age I tried to tell my Mom about something really important and she wouldn't believe me, so I know what it feels like. Let's make a deal, if anyone doesn't believe you, come and tell me. I will always believe you, OK?” Christi started crying and started telling all the things going on at home. Josh wanted to hug her but knew not to do that. Jennifer put her arm around Christi and took her to the nurses office.

In the investigation it came out that Christi’s mom was being abused by the boyfriend also and didn't know how to get out of the situation. He was threatening to kill both of them. The boyfriend was on parole so was arrested and put in prison.
     
Later Jennifer stopped by to say that she was impressed by how he handled the situation. She said the next cup of coffee was on her. Josh laughed, the coffee in the break room was free. But they did start to hang out, sharing classroom stories, what worked for them, and just life. 
      
Josh enjoyed operating in the shadows. He started a recycling drive for the school. He bought a 5’x8’ utility trailer and parked it in the school parking lot where anyone could drop off cans. He would have to take it in at least once a week, sometimes more. He used the funds for students that didn't have something. A suggestion box appeared in the staff lounge with a sign that if staff noticed a student that didn't have something, they could give the name and what was needed. Then a package would appear with the students name that had the items needed. The cafeteria staff had a fund for students that didn't have a proper lunch. Just the principal knew who was doing it. 
     
Josh was talking to Jennifer more now. One Friday they were leaving at the same time. They were chatting while walking. As Josh was starting to open his car door, Jennifer blurted out “Are you ever going to ask me out? I've been doing everything I can to show I'm interested, but if you aren't into girls or something like that, that's fine. I just need to know.” 
     
Josh's face turned bright red. He looked at the ground for a minute then looked up. “To be honest, I have never dated. I'm not sure how it works. I don't want to do anything inappropriate or something to make you feel uncomfortable.”
     
Jennifer broke out in a smile. “You start by asking if I would like to go out to eat. Then we go out and if you enjoy it, you ask me out again. Why haven't you dated? If you don't mind me asking.”
     
Josh thought about it for a second then told her “ When I was in high school here, there were two murders. I don't know if you remember it or not but the second was the girl I was seeing. We weren't really dating, I was helping her study. But we developed strong feelings for each other. It felt like I had failed to protect her and I wish I had died with her. It took me a really long time to heal from it. The pain I was feeling blinded me from seeing anyone else.” 
    
Jennifer responded “No, I moved here a few years ago. How did you heal? Did you go into counseling?” 
     
Josh told her “For a while I was not able to do anything. I quit the football team, I quit my job, I quit living. I just gave up on life. I did graduate because I knew she would hate me if I didn't.” 

Josh paused, took a deep breath, then continued “The police did not make any progress on the case so a good friend of mine suggested that I find the killer and bring him to justice. I joined the Air Force to learn how to become a detective, then came back here and joined the police department as a patrol officer. I was able to save two girls that had been kidnapped that were about the same age as Cindy Ann, which helped. I then worked on Cindy Ann's case on my own time and solved it. The murderer was the president of a local bank and was well connected politically in the state. He is now convicted but his buddies came after me, so I moved out to California where my Dad lives and finished my degree and got my teaching certificate. I moved back here and said goodbye to my old love so I could start living. So no, I never went to counseling but did a lot of self therapy.” Josh paused then added “I'm sorry. That was a lot to answer a simple question. I think I said too much. I've never talked about it before.”
    
Jennifer looked at him with misty eyes “No that answers a lot. So are we on for dinner tomorrow?” She gave him her address and phone number. After that first date Josh felt truly alive for the first time in such a long time. 
     
When he stopped by to see Dave and Beth, they noticed right away. When he told them about Jennifer, they insisted he bring her over. They were having a BBQ on Saturday, he could bring her then. Josh said he would check with her and if she was free, he would bring her. 
    
He called Jennifer and explained that Dave and Beth helped him a lot during his teen years and were like family to him. Dave was the one who helped him reconnect with his Dad after not hearing from him for almost seven years due to his mother. They really wanted to meet her. She agreed to go.
    
When they arrived, Jennifer was introduced to everyone. Dan and his wife, Anna, were there with little Josh. When the two Josh's went outside to play, Jennifer mentioned both of them being named Josh. What a coincidence. Dan told her the story about how little Josh got his name. He told her to look up “Mystery Football Player” online. Jennifer was quickly realizing that there was a lot more to Josh than being a cute school teacher.
    
Over the following months, Josh and Jennifer dated and got engaged. Since Jennifer didn't have any family that could make the trip, for the wedding Dave was Josh's Best Man and Beth was Jennifer's Maid of Honor. Josh’s Dad walked Jennifer down the aisle. They had asked Christi to be the flower girl since she played such a big part in them getting together. It was a beautiful wedding.
    
Josh was sitting in his classroom one afternoon after his students left when someone came in hesitantly. She started off “I don't know if you remember me….” 
    
Josh looked at her closely and it only took a second to place her. He broke out in a huge smile and replied “Of course I remember you. How could I forget? I can still see your faces when I close my eyes.You are one of the girls in the van. I was never told your names. You look like you are doing a lot better.”
    
She responded “My name is Bethany. Yes, I'm doing good. I never had a chance to thank you. But I have followed you through news reports. I wanted to let you know that I thought about becoming a police officer, but I realized that wasn't for me. Instead I became a doctor and just started as an ER doctor at the local hospital.” 
    
Josh insisted on taking her down to meet Jennifer. When they met, Jennifer told her how much it meant to Josh to be able to save her. Jennifer insisted they all stay in touch.
    
Josh and Jennifer were looking for a house to buy. He still had the education fund that his Dad said they could use as a down payment. They were looking at listings when one jumped out at Josh. He had to double check but it was his childhood home. They walked through. The home was maintained in great condition. So many happy memories came flooding back to Josh. Memories before the divorce, back when life was good. Two months later they were moving in, ready to make new happy memories. 

Years later Josh was asked to attend the high school graduation for the class that he taught the first year of teaching. The class had voted that he was the teacher that had influenced them the most. Josh spotted Christi. She came running up to him and gave him a big hug. She thanked him for saving her life, figuratively and literally. Her Mom wound up marrying a really nice man and their lives had been stable and happy since. She was now headed to college to become a teacher. She hoped she would be able to influence someone's life like he had influenced hers.
    
Life for him seemed to be a circle. Always circling back to a better place. Now he was looking forward to doing projects in the garage, mowing the yard, smelling fresh cut grass in the spring, only this time there would be no divorce, no drugs, no heartbreak as long as he had anything to do with it. Life for Josh was good again, only now it was even better.

2. Walking with the Patriarch
Carry the presence of Ol Grandfather with you today. He is your foundational figure, the root of the Thorne and Xanthe lineage. When you face the ""high-pitched whine"" of daily stress, lean into that ""foundational importance."" You are the living record of his history. Every productive action you take today is a new, factual entry in the family ledger—a tribute to where you came from and a map for where you are going.

What changed wasn’t “confidence” or any magic trick. I just forced myself to do small reps until my brain stopped acting like it was life or death.

Started small:

sit in a coffee shop and just chill

say “hey” to the cashier

ask random questions like “what do you recommend?”

short convos with zero goal

Compliments were impossible too, so I started with safe ones like “cool shoes” and kept it moving. No trying to turn it into anything.

After a while it stopped feeling like danger and started feeling normal.

Also biggest mindset shift was switching from “please like me” to “do I even like her?” Takes them off the pedestal instantly.

I always feel like I’m about to go, especially when I sit down, but nothing really ever happens. Also, i feel gas get trapped down in my bottom left abdomen as well.

I’m confused as my stool has gotten softer but for some reason it’s difficult to pass still. Warm beverages due help (coffee, prune juice). Any idea what might be the issue here?

I was in a relationship from 2021 to early 2025 — almost four years. I finally broke it off because despite giving multiple chances, my ex kept talking to other girls and eventually became emotionally abusive. Our families were involved too, which made leaving harder, but I ended it in February 2025.
I wasn’t fully over him, but I was very clear I wouldn’t go back. I stopped responding even when he tried to contact me.
At that point, I made a profile on Shaadi.com — not for casual dating, but because I’m someone who wants to marry, not “see where things go.” I was clear about that from the start.
That’s where I met M (24) — let’s call him XYZ.
He was from a reputed institute (IIT), working in an MNC in Bangalore. He came across as confident, well-settled, and spoke openly about his family background — his father runs a large business, they’re financially very stable, etc. He talked about future plans, international travel, even casually mentioned things like Amsterdam trips.
But I wasn’t impressed by money or promises. I made my boundaries clear early:
I don’t want anything casual
I want clarity and commitment
I won’t accept things emotionally unless we actually meet and see compatibility
We spoke a lot during March and April — long calls, deep conversations. Sometimes, if I casually mentioned feeling tired or hot, he’d send small things like coffee or chocolates. While it seemed sweet, I repeatedly told him not to overdo gestures without clarity. I insisted that real commitment can only come after meeting in person.
Now comes the part that changed everything.
At the end of April, on a Saturday, I told him I’d be out with friends in South Bombay all day and wouldn’t be able to talk much. He asked what time I was leaving — I said around 8 AM. He said okay.
The next morning, while I was already out, I got a call from him.
He said:
“I’m in Mumbai.”
No discussion. No plan. No consent.
He had flown overnight from Bangalore.
I was shocked. Part of me acknowledged the effort, but another part felt extremely uncomfortable. It felt sudden, desperate, and intrusive — especially since I never invited him.
I eventually agreed to meet him because I felt guilty. After all, he had traveled because of me.
But the moment I met him around 8 AM, I knew — this was not going to work.
It wasn’t about looks. It wasn’t superficial.
It was about a serious lie he had told me earlier — something that revealed itself clearly the moment we met. That lie alone was enough for me to mentally check out.
Still, I stayed with him till around 9 PM.
Why? Because I didn’t want him to feel abandoned in a city he came to for me. I kept thinking — If I reject him immediately, what will he do the whole day?
So I treated the meeting like a friendly interaction, even though I already knew my decision.
I know I made mistakes too — especially not setting firmer boundaries earlier.
I’ll share in my next post what that one lie was that made me decide, within minutes of meeting him, that this was a hard no.

If anyone could please advise of things to do during our stay it would be greatly appreciated. We love beach walks, quaint shops, beautiful food and great coffee - relaxing vibes! 

Only thing I’ve set my mind to do is a day trip to Martha’s Vineyard but open to all suggestions

I have lived without a car for around half of that time and I'm hoping to wait to pull the plug on buying a car for at least a year. I figured I'd try biking and buses and relying on family and friends to get around for a while. I know it is a privilege to be car free (remote work, family help, etc.) but I also just want to see how long I can make it without a car. I'm not worried about the heat. In the era before the smart phone, I was car free/bus, parent and bike dependent with an outdoor job from 15-18.

So my question is, where can I live that will best allow me to live car free? I'm asking for specific apartment suggestions or at least walkable neighborhoods that have a HEB (the second biggest reason I'm moving back), maybe a local yoga studio and maybe even a coffee shop or restaurant nearby. The more vibrant the community the better of course but I'd like to keep my rent less than 2K for a 1 bedroom. I'd also love reasonably safe walking conditions (sidewalks, cross lights, no angry men in huge trucks who think pedestrians are targets, etc.). I know about the domain and it is not my first choice but I'm open.

Thanks in advance and I can't wait to be back in my city!",0,1767976306.0,askaustin,12,0.36,False

You love each other, deeply. You trust each other... mostly.

But by night, you're both someone else entirely.
You're a superhero, sworn to protect the city from chaos, crime, and the shadows that lurk beneath.
The twist? So is your partner. And neither of you knows it.
You’ve both become adept at keeping secrets: sneaking out in the middle of the night, hiding bruises and burn marks, making up wild excuses about late meetings or ""helping a friend move.""

But recently, the hero association had assigned you a partner. A mysterious vigilante is bound to your patrols Skilled, daring, irritatingly familiar. There’s something about the way they move, the way they speak. It's starting to gnaw at you, there's even the slightest hint of attraction towards the vigilante that has been partnered with you. Even at home you cannot shake the sense that you know this strange vigilante. 



(Hey there, I'm Jacob, a 24-year-old writer looking for a creative partner to collaborate on a prompt I’ve come up with. I enjoy writing romantic slice-of-life stories with a touch of action, adventure, and a good dose of drama to keep things engaging.

I consider myself an advanced writer, I love world-building and crafting characters that evolve over time and overcome their flaws. I love to put effort into the details that bring a story to life, whether it's exploring relationships, creating tension, or building a setting. My replies typically range from 2-4 detailed paragraphs, either moving the plot forward or delving into the current scene to add depth.
I’m looking for a cooperative writing partner. Someone who is comfortable with contributing to the story, not just a passive participant. I want to build a world together, bounce ideas back and forth, and make the experience enjoyable for both of us.

If this sounds like your kind of jam, feel free to send me a message! I’d love to discuss ideas and see if we’d be a good creative match.
Looking forward to writing with you!
Thanks,

1q8cxha,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1q8cxha/grind_finer_much_finer_for_less_bitterness/,"Grind finer, MUCH finer for less bitterness","Admittedly something of a clickbait title, but it still accurately describes a super interesting discovery I just made. In short I found that with a higher quality grinder I need to grind way finer than I used to with a bad grinder, which was counterintuitive and took diving into some nerdy science to land on it. 

I recently got a few new toys between Christmas gifts and treating myself, including a DF54 and a fellow prismo. Problem was, that doing everything as close to how I used to with my crappy cuisinart grinder I was getting incredibly bitter cups. I’m talking straight up soap. I tried different temperatures, doses, grind settings etc but was not even close to a good cup. 

Here’s the thing though. I had watched the James Hoffmann series, tried his recipe and found that it was too bitter with the cuisinart when I ground the way he recommended. I slowly found that using a nearly french press grind and 95 C gave the best results with my favorite dark roasted Sumatran. I figured I just was using a darker roast which accounted for the difference. 

I’ve been reading a lot of science based articles from Johnathan Gagne and barista hustle which gave me an idea. They suggest that bitter compounds are heavy, big molecules that actually don’t extract as easily as the other chemicals in coffee. These molecules will extract much more if the coffee flows through the bed fast enough to create turbulence, which causes more mixing. You can interrogate the causes of turbulence, and basically a coffee bed with lots of large diameter pores, and relatively direct paths through will have dramatically higher turbulence. Finer particles create a finer, less permeable bed, which causes less turbulence. Therefore it stands to reason that I actually needed a more resistive bed, and to grind very fine. I think my old grinder was creating a ton of fines, which was why I got good results with a coarser grind. 

I tried it this morning. I used a setting at the upper end of espresso, and got the best cup I’ve ever made with this grinder. I have lots of optimization to do from here but I’m so thrilled with these results. ",3,1767976263.0,AeroPress,2,0.71,False

If the reports are accurate, the shape of the move matters more than the headline.
When liquidity is routed toward small business, it is rarely just stimulus.
It is also instrumentation.

Framing cautiously.
Programs like this typically serve dual purposes:

• Increase short-term liquidity where real economic activity exists
• Improve visibility and traceability through formal channels

Helping legitimate operators and clarifying who is not one are not opposing goals.
They are complementary.

Builder translation.
Money that moves through compliant rails carries metadata.
Real businesses already have the structure to receive it.
Ghost entities struggle because they lack continuity, documentation, or delivery.

That is not enforcement theater.
That is systems hygiene.

Avoid assuming motive.

For actual small businesses, this kind of shift can feel like relief.

NoSleep isn’t really my thing anymore. I used to lurk there years ago. But this feels like the only place where people won’t immediately tell me I’m losing it or that I should call the cops. I don’t want the cops involved. I don’t want anyone involved, honestly. I just want to write it down and maybe sleep without checking the corners of the room.

Last fall I bought a house outside of town. Not some grand Victorian or anything. Just an old two-story farmhouse built in the twenties, sitting on five acres that had gone mostly to seed. The price was stupid low because it had sat empty for twelve years after the previous owner died in it. Natural causes, they said. Heart attack in his sleep. I didn’t care about that part; I’m not superstitious. I just wanted quiet. I work remote, I’m single, I like my own space. The house needed work, but nothing structural. Mostly cosmetic stuff I could handle myself.

I moved in mid-October. First couple weeks were normal. I’d work during the day, fix something small in the evenings, fall asleep to the sound of wind in the trees. The house creaked like any old place does. I got used to it.

The first thing that felt off was the smell. Not rot or mold. Something sweeter, almost metallic, like wet pennies left in milk. It would show up for a minute or two, usually in the upstairs hallway, then vanish. I figured old pipes or mice dying in the walls. I set traps. Nothing ever turned up.

Then came the listening feeling. You know when you’re alone but you swear someone’s paying very close attention to you? It started in the living room at night. I’d be on the couch with my laptop and the room would just quiet down too much. Like the house itself was holding its breath. I’d look up and nothing would be there, but the feeling wouldn’t leave until I turned on more lights or played something loud.

I started sleeping with the TV on.

Around Thanksgiving I noticed the scratches. They were on the inside of the closet door in the guest bedroom. Long, shallow grooves in the wood, four parallel lines, like something with claws had tried to dig its way out. They weren’t deep, and the paint was chipped in a way that made them look old. I figured the previous owner’s dog or maybe kids messing around decades ago. I sanded them down and repainted. The smell got a little stronger that week, but only in that room.

Christmas came and went. I didn’t put up decorations. One night I woke up around 3 a.m. with that metallic taste in my mouth, the one you get when you’re really scared. The house was dead silent. I lay there listening, and after a minute I heard it: a soft scrape from the hallway, slow, like fingernails trailing along the wall. It stopped outside my bedroom door. I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. Eventually it started again, moving away, down the stairs. I waited until sunrise before I got out of bed.

There were no marks on the walls.

January hit and the weather turned brutal. I barely left the house. That’s when I started seeing the shape.

It’s never clear. It’s always in the corner of my eye, or reflected in a dark window, or just suggested by the way the shadows fall. Tall. Thin. Too many joints. It doesn’t move like a person. It folds, more than walks. And it watches. I’ll be in the kitchen making coffee and I’ll feel that listening feeling again, heavier than before, and when I turn around there’s nothing. But the air feels thicker where it was.

Last week I finally worked up the nerve to go into the crawlspace under the house. I’d been avoiding it because it’s low and muddy and full of spiderwebs. I took a flashlight and crawled in maybe ten feet. That’s where I found the nest. Or whatever it is.

It’s a hollowed-out spot under the floorboards of the guest bedroom. Old blankets, shredded clothes, bits of bone I don’t want to think about. Everything soaked through with that sweet-metal smell. And in the middle, pressed into the dirt like someone had been lying there a long time, was the outline of that shape. Long limbs folded up, head tilted wrong. The dirt was still damp.

I backed out of there so fast I scraped my knees raw.

I haven’t slept in the bedroom since. I stay downstairs on the couch with every light on. Sometimes I hear it moving overhead. Slow, patient steps across the floorboards, pausing outside the guest room door like it’s waiting for something.

I don’t know what it wants. I don’t know if it’s always been here or if I brought it with me somehow. All I know is that it’s getting braver. Last night I woke up on the couch and the listening feeling was right next to me. I opened my eyes and saw nothing, but I swear the cushion beside me was depressed, like something heavy had just sat down.

I’m writing this from the kitchen table at 4 a.m. with all the lights on and the radio playing low. The house is quiet right now. Too quiet.

I don’t know how much longer I can stay here. But leaving feels worse, like it would just follow.

If anyone’s got any idea what this thing is, or what it wants, I don’t know. Just tell me I’m not crazy. Please.",8,1767976133.0,nosleep,0,0.91,False

This gives us unrivaled visibility into the everyday rhythms of work: the cycles, the moments that matter most, and the interactions that drive engagement and performance across different roles.
2. **30 years of Great Place To Work® (GPTW) data** – the industry-standard benchmarks that reveal what truly makes organizations high-performing and people-centered. 

By bringing these two streams of data together, we offer organizations something no one else can:

* **A real-world lens** – rooted in the lived experiences of employees, from the frontline to leadership.

1q8cq0x,https://i.redd.it/tpptp74mmccg1.jpeg,DONKEY CAUCUS TOMORROW! Plus CD02 and Senate Candidate Meet and Greet!,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  

Isle of Wight County Rural Democrats Call Reorganization Caucus to Build Local Democratic Power  

Windsor, VA - January 10, 2026  

The Isle of Wight County Rural Democrats are calling on Democrats across Isle of Wight to step forward, get involved, and help shape the future of local Democratic organizing at a Reorganization Caucus on Saturday, January 10, 2026, at the Windsor Town Center.  

The caucus will run from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., with doors opening at 9:00 a.m. for check-in, donuts by Ringo’s Donuts of Smithfield, and coffee. Lunch by The Rusted Root Cafe in Windsor will be provided afterward at 1:00 p.m., and participants are encouraged to stay through the entire process as the committee elects its new membership and leadership. The festivities will include door prizes and giveaways, too!   

Candidates for office are invited to speak at 11:45 am. U.S. House Candidates for 2026, including Nila Devanath, Elaine Luria, Patrick Molsof, James Osyf (who has suspended his campaign), and Matthew Strickler, are excited to attend and meet constituents. In the U.S. Senate race, primary challenger Lorita Daniels will be meeting Isle of Wight residents to answer questions and share her vision. Incumbent Senator Mark Warner will relay a video message to the caucus promoting strong democratic organization, hope, and encouragement. State House Delegate Nadarius Clark will offer a keynote address at 1pm, just before lunch.   

This caucus is a critical moment for Democrats in Isle of Wight County. Reorganization determines who serves in leadership on the local Democratic Committee and how the party organizes, communicates, and mobilizes voters in the years ahead. With local, state, and national elections on the horizon, the Rural Democrats are emphasizing that strong local infrastructure starts with participation.  

“Democracy doesn’t organize itself,” said Bill Robinson, Chair of the Isle of Wight County Democratic Committee. “This caucus is about opening the doors, welcoming new voices, and building a committee that reflects the values, diverse experiences, and views, and determination of Democrats in Isle of Wight County. If you care about public schools, healthcare, working families, reproductive freedom, and fair representation, this is where your voice matters.”  

All registered Democratic voters in Isle of Wight County are eligible to attend and participate, including first-time attendees. Candidates for committee leadership must submit a Filing Form by the designated deadline, as outlined in the official Call to Caucus. There is no filing fee to run for committee leadership. Friends from around Hampton Roads and beyond are invited to join the group to meet the candidates and become supporting members.  

Immediately following the caucus, the newly confirmed committee will meet to elect its officers, setting leadership and direction for the next term.

I have a nespresso vertuo and this might be a silly question - I typically make full 230 ml coffees and use creamer with my nespresso, but i’ve been trying to make iced lattes at home using espresso pods. Everytime I try to make a latte, it just tastes like espresso and cold milk, like it’s not properly blended even when i stir it up good or the proportion is off or something- it just does not taste “right”. Any tips for making an iced latte worth drinking at home? Am i missing a step? Sincerely, trying to spend less at coffee shops in 2026 :) ",1,1767975799.0,nespresso,4,0.6,False
1q8cplb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FMD/comments/1q8cplb/prolon_fmd_vs_wateronly_fasting/,Prolon FMD vs water-only fasting,"Completed my first prolon FMD (expanded variety pack) and I wanted to share some pros-cons of Prolon vs a water-only extended fast.

**Prolon FMD/DIY PROs vs water-only fasting** 

1. You eat something everyday. This is especially meaningful socially with family and friends. 

During water-only fasts, I would still sit at the dinning table with water or hot tea. But family and friends still comment because they feel bad that you’re not eating. I found it more challenging when it’s only 2 people at the table. All are very supportive of my goals, but I get why it’s a little odd.

With FMD, I have my soup and crackers and it’s gatherings as usual!

2. With FMD, I didn’t experience the lower energy, lethargic feelings and generally felt pretty good (except the nausea from their soups… perhaps I’m sensitive to inulin) vs. during a water-only fast. 

Friends and family who didn’t know I was water fasting asked if I was okay… I did all my daily activities fine but noticeably less energy around day 4-5 with water only. 

3. You can do it repeatedly, 3 monthly cycles (or more) - safely with more up sides than down vs water-only. 

The research supports repeated FMD cycles, with excellent benefits. 

And research cautions water-only fasting (repeated monthly or for longer duration, instead of say 2x a year for up to 7 days)…can result in lower lean body mass plus other downsides.

**Prolon FMD/DIY CONs vs water-only fasting** 

1. There’s more “to-do” with FMD. With water-only fasting, my only job is to not any food in my mouth except water, tea, coffee black (dirty fasts are lovely).

With FMD, you’ve got to plan more. Breakfast bars are easy, but for lunch and snack - you’ve got to make sure you pack what you need if you’re working or going out that day. 

If you’re going out to lunch or dinner, then you’ve got to pack your soups. I made mines on stovetop, and brought my soup in a thermos to a lunch date during my FMD. I had to pack my supplements and crackers. Plus pre-mix half the glycerin in a water bottle to-go. 

2. It costs more. Prolon kit is around $175 (folks, if you don’t have a kit yet and want one - look for discount codes online before purchasing!). DIY costs less, but you’re doing a lot of mental gymnastics with calories/macros and substitutions and leg work (with gathering all those things).

A water-only fast is free. 

3. Water tastes better to me than the prolon soups. 😂

Yes, I think water is delicious. 

With DIY, the organic canned soups tasted like I was being served soup at a Michelin starred restaurant! The Mary’s Gone Crackers superseed that I paired that canned soup with tasted heavenly. Especially when compared to the prolon almond-kale crackers. 

So I got a fine dinning experience at a fraction of the cost!

**Verdict** 

If I had to choose only one, I’d choose FMD hands down.

But no need to choose, lol. My plan is to do 3 consecutive cycles of FMD (Jan-March). And 1-2x extended 5 day+ water fasts this year. ",4,1767975788.0,FMD,2,1.0,False

I actually interviewed this guy once, which is how we exchanged numbers and emails. Later we went on a few dates. Like… a FEW. He bought me some snacks, I accepted them. And somewhere after that, his energy shifted.

So this is what happened.

I was texting him, very normal conversation, talking about my favorite food. And then I get a message that’s just emojis like that shit 🍑🍆👄. Just stared at my phone thinking, what the actual hell is this?

We’ve met in person maybe a handful of times. I don’t even know if he likes coffee. Or dogs. Or whether he’s one of those pineapple-on-pizza people. And now he’s sending me fruit-and-vegetable code. About… what exactly? My body? Some part of me? My brain fully short-circuited.

I don’t like that instant wave of feelings that hit all at once. Shock. Disgust. And this annoying internal debate of “do I laugh this off or do I block him right now?” My entire brain was screaming: TOO FAST. TOO MUCH. WE ARE NOT THERE.

And look, I get it. In the right context, those emojis can be “funny.” Sure. But THIS was not that context. I was sitting at my desk, in work clothes, drinking coffee, trying to decide if I was texting a grown man or a perverted emoji robot.

So I made an excuse. Said I had work to do. Put my phone down. And then I just sat there thinking… who taught men that this is an acceptable way to escalate things? Like, who told you this works?

Honestly, can we bring normal language back? “Hey.” “How are you?” Even a dumb cat GIF. ANYTHING is better than surprise vegetable dick.",3,1767975783.0,I_DONT_LIKE,5,0.64,False

when you smoke too much ciggaretes, your ""Stress"" changes to ""Smoking"" and makes other non-smoking/tobacco effects less effective.

And heck why not make it also for Coffee/Energy Drinks to replace ""Fatigue"" to ""Caffeine"" if you drank too much coffee/Energy Drinks and become addictied to it which will increase the Fatique rate.

This idea is for consistency and i think Topless gun could easily implement this idea since in MSC, you can already become addictied to coffee or/and ciggaretes.",7,1767975779.0,MyWinterCar,1,0.89,False

Getting very frustrated from one shot to the next of the grind consistency on my Baratza Forté.

I replaced the burrs, shimmed them and have plenty of experience using it, but I'll be damned if one shot pulls amazing and the next runs at half the volume of output.

For the price of this grinder, it lacks consistency and I am done spending many hours of my time trying to make it so.

I'm not afraid of taking time to get something dialed in, I just don't want to have to do do it so often and still get inconsistent results.

***What I am looking for in a new dedicated espresso grinder:***

**Must Have**

* Flat burrs.
* Excellent consistency and little drift once dialed in.
* Minimal grounds retention.
* Under cabinet fit

**Nice to have**

* Hopper and one shot loading
* Scale
* Aftermarket burr selection

What is the best grinder that fit's this around $1000 (or less even or maybe possibly a little more lol).

1q8coyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/1q8coyt/pc_or_console_between_20102017_2d_sidescrolling/,[PC or Console] [between 2010-2017] 2D sidescrolling black hole platformer,"Platforms:

This I’m unsure of. As I never played the game, and only saw footage of it. I have reason to believe it’s on PC/Mac, but because my memories of the game are potentially 15+ years old, I’m willing to assume it could’ve also been on console (specifically Xbox or PlayStation)

Estimated year of release:

2010 to 2017 is my widest guess, since I for sure saw it on YouTube sometime in that era. I sadly can’t remember the exact year but from what I remember of the game’s visuals make me believe it wasn’t an early 2000’s game.

Graphics/art style:

This I’m not certain on, but I know it was either well detailed pixel art or maybe a hand drawn appearance you’d see in SteamWorld heist (but less visually detailed). The game was a 2D side scroller, meaning perspective wise it would look like a Mario game (but it did not at all look like a Mario in terms of art style). Visually the game was fairly dark and industrial, with your characters cube being well lit, but just about everything outside of there being dark or dimly lit. The background was consistently a swirling black hole taking up a fair chunk of the background that obviously hinted at the danger of your character’s workplace. The reason why I mentioned that steamworld heist is because as far as I can recall, the colour pallet was similar in that the black hole was likely dark blue or purple near the edges. The game had a slightly cartoonish style, and as far as I remember your character’s was shorter and similar In shape to Zombotron 1 and 2’s protagonists. The character’s face was never fully visible as far as I recall, so it might’ve just been a blank slate or obstructed by his hat and beard (not sure if he had a beard).

Notable characters:

The main protagonist that the player plays was a man who had (I believe) a blue and possibly white trucker hat. He might’ve also had overalls and a beard, but he was very clearly designed to look like a blue collar worker.

The only other characters that existed (as far as I recall) were the monsters/aliens your character faced. They typically had a very shadowy appearance, and might’ve had glowing orange or purple bits in them (I could be completely wrong here). 

Notable gameplay mechanics:

This I remember very well, the player’s character worked in a fairly well lit cube (maybe even a container I just remember them being very rectangular), with a massive black hole or black hole adjacent object in the background (as mentioned in the graphics section). Your characters didn’t have to rest between jobs or anything from what I remember. There was a computer on the left side of the cube where your character could see a ‘map’ of nearby cubes. You could then activate some magnet or tractor beam to attract the cube towards your cube. You then boarded that other cube, and loot it quickly before your time runs out and the cube you’re looting is sucked into the black hole (not sure if the time limit actually existed, but this was the main gameplay loop). Typically the cubes you were looting were dimly lit and derelict with clear signs of decay or neglect, and gravity often would rotate completely or (maybe?) be disabled when you entered these abandoned cubes. Sometimes aliens/monsters would be in these cubes and you’d have to avoid them. I can’t remember if you could actually combat them or not. Your character might’ve had some kind of gravity tool like Gmod’s gravity gun, or some other weapon similar to that but I’m not sure if it could be used as a weapon.

Other details:

I remember seeing this game being played by a male YouTuber sometime between 2010 to 2017. The YouTuber didn’t have a facecam or anything, and I’m not sure but I believe they made a few videos about the game. The videos were probably 20 minutes to half an hour long. I thought it was OfficialNerdCubed or Yippee Ki Yay Mr Falcon but so far haven’t found it on either’s channel.

I believe I remember the name of the game had  “neer” in the name, kinda line engineer or ‘cubeneer’ or something, but once again I could be wrong as with most of the details about this game.

Your character could interact with a cup of coffee/joe in their cube, they’d stop moving and have a sip. Not sure why I remember this and just like most of this post, not sure if I’m misremembering but hopefully it narrows things down.",1,1767975750.0,tipofmyjoystick,1,1.0,False
