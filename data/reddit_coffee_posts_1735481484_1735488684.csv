1hoywko,https://www.reddit.com/r/usvisascheduling/comments/1hoywko/my_positive_b1b2_visa_experience_hyderabad_vac/,"My Positive B1/B2 Visa Experience (Hyderabad VAC & Consulate)
","Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my recent B1/B2 visa experience in Hyderabad, as I know how stressful this process can be. This community has been incredibly helpful, and reading posts here eased my anxiety. As a 35-year-old single Indian woman applying for a tourist visa to visit a friend and have a short vacation, I was super nervous about how my profile would be viewed. I had the support of amazing individuals who reassured me that all I could do was prepare well and let the process take its course. And that I was over prepared :P

But now, I hope my story can help someone else.

# How I Got My Early Slot

I was lucky to come across an amazing agent online who helped me secure an early slot. It was pure chance‚ÄîI found this person without any referrals, and they turned out to be incredibly genuine, quick, and efficient. If anyone needs their contact, feel free to reach out. This step can be stressful, but finding the right person made it seamless for me.

Biometric  Appointment  (23rd  December, Hyderabad VAC)

The VAC is located in Hitech City, next to NIFT, and is well-connected to the metro. There‚Äôs a **locker facility right downstairs** in the same complex, which is a big relief.

# Documents to Carry:

* **DS-160 Confirmation Page**
* **Appointment Confirmation Page**
* **Passport**

Do not bring electronics, including Fitbits or digital watches (plain analog watches are fine). Also, you don‚Äôt need to carry the full DS-160 application form‚Äîit‚Äôs just for reference. This applies to the Consulate appointment as well.¬†

I arrived about an hour early, but you‚Äôll only be allowed into the queue 30 minutes before your scheduled time, so there‚Äôs no point arriving too early. The process was smooth:

1. **Security Check**: Similar to an airport, you‚Äôll pass through a security checkpoint.
2. **Queue**: You‚Äôll wait in a queue to be assigned a window.
3. **Biometric Process**: At the window, they‚Äôll take your fingerprints and photo.

The entire process took about 20 minutes, and the staff was polite and efficient. There‚Äôs nothing to worry about here.

**Visa Interview (26th December, Hyderabad Consulate)**

This is where the nerves kicked in. I reached the consulate at 7:30 AM, even though my appointment was at 9:00 AM. You‚Äôll only be allowed to stand in the queue 15‚Äì20 minutes before your appointment time, so arriving very early doesn‚Äôt really help. The security personnel put up a board with the time slots and also make announcements. You just need to stay attentive in the crowd to listen for your slot and check the board for updates.

# Locker Facility & Cafes

Contrary to some older posts, there is now a locker facility conveniently located right across from the consulate. It‚Äôs a newly built facility‚Äîearlier, people had to rely on hotels or shops across the road to store their belongings. I had arrived with the same mindset, thinking I‚Äôd need to find a nearby shop or hotel, as I didn‚Äôt want to leave my phone at the hotel, knowing I‚Äôd need it regardless of the interview‚Äôs outcome.

The locker facility is parallel to the **US Consulate General building**, accompanied by two small cafes. There‚Äôs even a small sitting area, though it can only accommodate about 15‚Äì20 people. I felt there should be more seating available, especially considering the number of senior citizens and parents accompanying their children for student visas.

As a solo traveler, this facility was an absolute lifesaver for me. Without a support system (like a friend or family member to hold my belongings), managing logistics can get tricky. The locker facility charged ‚Çπ200 for a small locker, which is a bit pricey but worth it for the convenience. Additionally, they offer services like printing and DS-160 corrections if needed, along with the cafes for a quick coffee or tea break

# Documents I Carried

* **DS-160 Confirmation Page**
* **Appointment Confirmation Page**
* **Passport**
* Last three months‚Äô payslips
* Six months bank statements
* Last three years‚Äô ITR
* Employment contract (optional)

I carried every possible document just to be safe. While I didn‚Äôt see them asking for many documents during the interviews, you never know when they might. If you‚Äôre missing something like a leave approval letter or an invitation letter, don‚Äôt stress too much.  Because only much you can do.

Just have a clear, logical explanation ready. They look for clarity in reasoning, genuineness, and sincerity.

For example, I didn‚Äôt carry a No Objection Certificate (NOC) as a contractual employee for a government project. Instead, I prepared a clear explanation in case they asked about it. Similarly, I chose not to present the invitation letter my friend had sent me because it felt too open-ended. Additionally, I didn‚Äôt have my friend‚Äôs passport or visa details, which are often suggested to accompany an invitation letter.

In preparation, I made sure to have logical and authentic explanations ready for these situations. If asked why I wasn‚Äôt carrying certain documents, I would confidently explain my reasoning. That‚Äôs the key‚Äîhaving a genuine and well-thought-out explanation. Ultimately, that‚Äôs all we can do from our end to be prepared for the interview.

Because people are denied even with all the documents in place!

# In the Queue

I was assigned to Counter 23, but before my turn, a lady in her 40s was right before me. She was applying for a visitor visa to attend a conference. While I couldn‚Äôt hear the full conversation, I caught bits and pieces, and unfortunately, her visa was denied. She was handed a white slip, and the officer explained the reason politely. It was sad to witness and definitely added to my nervousness.

While waiting, I could also hear a student‚Äôs interview at the next counter, Counter 24. The officer was asking him about his funding‚Äîhow he planned to support himself for each year of his four year program. He answered with reasoning around savings and loans, and his visa was granted. Watching him leave with a big smile gave me a little hope and helped ease my nerves.

I was immediately called up to Counter 23 right after the lady‚Äôs rejection. Seeing the contrasting outcomes added to my nervousness, but I reminded myself to stay calm, focus, and answer clearly.

# My Interview Experience

Here‚Äôs how my interview went:

**Me:** Good morning, officer.**VO:** Passport.**Me:** (Handed over my passport.)

**VO:** Why are you traveling to the U.S.? **Me:** To visit a friend and explore as a tourist. (I added a few specific places I planned to visit for context.)

**VO:** What do you do for work?**Me:** (Briefly explained my role, aligned with what I mentioned in my DS-160.)

**VO:** How long do you plan to stay?**Me:** From the day I land to the night I take off‚Äîabout two and a half weeks.

**VO:** Your visa is approved. (She had to tell me this twice.) :D

**Me:** (I couldn‚Äôt believe it at first!) I said, ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù and quickly added, ‚ÄúWish you a Merry Christmas!‚Äù I had wanted to thank her for the work she does, but there‚Äôs no time for that as the next person is immediately called up.

Leaving the queue without my passport but knowing my visa was approved felt a bit surreal.

The officer‚Äôs tone was neutral but professional throughout. I made sure to answer clearly and align my answers with my DS-160, which seemed to help. The entire interaction lasted just a few minutes.

# Final Thoughts

Luck does play a role, but preparation, clarity, and sincerity are just as important. Seeing someone denied right before me was unsettling, but I reminded myself to focus on my own case and stay composed.

As a solo traveler, the locker facility and nearby services were a huge relief and made the entire process much smoother. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to have received my visa and am now excitedly looking forward to my trip!

To anyone preparing for their own B1/B2 visa journey, my advice is to give short, fluid, and logical answers while staying calm and genuine.

Feel free to ask any questions‚ÄîI‚Äôd be happy to help!

I've spent the past few years focusing on career growth and left my social life behind.

It's about time I start making an effort again. Darn Vancouver and it's cost of living driving most young adult men out of their social circles to try to become the man their father was! ü•π

Any who, to tell you a little bit about myself:

I absolutely love PC Building, PC Games (Especially split-screen local games), Web Development as a hobby of mine, been learning indie game development but I'm darn awful at pixel art so that's been a challenge for myself.. I dream to develop a game and publish it to Steam in my lifetime. My IRL persona consists of being a lazy person as of recent cancelling my gym membership due to it being too cold to commute to the gym and with the rising cost of me not making good use of it, I love to ride my bike when the weathers nice and am a coffee addict. I do not like sports, sorry if that's going to be a deal breaker!

Ideally I'd love to connect with people online and create a discord social group (Small circle of people who like the same things) and eventually be comfortable with one another to become friends IRL.

My top played games right now: League Of Legends, Escape From Tarkov, Project Zomboid

I ran it for two Chronicles, one a race against time to stop the return of a powerful Keeper, which was followed by a murder mystery that delved more into the history of the city's Lost.","I also have a whole write-up for the city and lore, if folks want to see it, but these are the three courts as I see them, based in the history of Rio and its climate.

**The Court of Rains**

(The Bloody Blade, the Sapphire Court, the Court of Outrage)

(The Court of Storms, of Rainbows, of Floods, of Fury, of Sweat, of Umbrellas, of Summer)



Never forget, never forgive. That is the motto of the Court of Rains, in particular where it concerns the True Fae. A mainstay of their mission is to remind themselves and others what was done to them in Arcadia, and what will happen if they are ever reclaimed. They shout it to the rooftops, bellow it until they are hoarse, then whisper it in vicious, angry hisses. Though their method is subtly different, their goal is the same as that of the northern Summer Courts: to drive Changelings to stand together and fight to the last again any who would take away their hard-won freedom.

The Court of Rains tends to be found in tropical climes, places where the summer monsoons roll in with oppressive heat and humidity. It is a time when people are both more easily irritated but also drained. Some answer this time with violence, and the Court welcomes this. Others greet it with complacency and lethargy, and the Court seeks to shake them from this. It goes by other names in other regions, such as the Monsoon Court, but the focus remains the same.

Their founder is said to be a Changeling in India known only as The Five-Armed Warrior. Some claim him to have been an Ogre, others Fairest, still others Beast, but all know the tale of how he chopped off one of his own arms rather than be dragged back to Arcadia by a trap set by his Keeper. Hence it is the Bloody Blade, often a machete, befitting jungle regions.

Normally known as the Ruby Court, in Rio it has become the Sapphire Court instead, a stone of many colors, gleaming blue like the rain and sea, green like the jungle, yellow like the sun.

As with the Summer Court, not all members of the Court are strong; some evince instead a talent for whipping others up into a frenzy of activity, or call upon the powers of growth and life in a riotous display to hold back the Keepers. All believe that a show of strength is key, that Outrage is vital, whether it is your own or somebody else's.



**Courtiers**

Changelings who join the Court of Rains are usually pretty similar to those who join the Summer Court; the more direct, conflict-minded refugees from Arcadia. When they see an assault, their solution is to fight back. To such a person's eyes, webs of intrigue and plotting nearly beg to be torn down around their weavers; even the most manipulative of them often curiously WANT to be caught, so that their deviance will ignite a fire in others.

Rain Courtiers come in many guises; those that burn with righteous fury, those with hardened dedication, with blazing energy, with brutal certainty. They can be freedom fighters or bullies, leaders or followers, but all burn in some way, and all seek something to quench that burning. They often speak in terms of hunger and thirst, of drought and famine, of boiling heat and relief-granting rain.

The court sometimes also gets those not subtle enough for the Cloud Court nor creative enough for the Carnival Court, though in a scheme with only three courts, it tends to be easier to find your place in any one of them. Others join seeking camaraderie, safety in numbers.

Most are encouraged to learn more than brute force, to come to understand tactics and rabble-rousing, the power of the media and politics and laying open lies with brutal words of truth.

Training and pledging to the Court of Rains most often happens in the summer, making equal use of the labyrinthine favelas and the vast natural parks. Those who don't prove themselves competent are invited to keep training and try again next year.

Many more aggressive Changelings join this court initially; Ogres and more forceful Beasts and Elementals. Anybody can feel outrage, though, and members of every Seeming find ways to express this. Some do so very bluntly while others master a more subtle variety. Elementals and others with affinities for fire, water, and plants are also commonplace within the court, as are many who fought their way out of Arcadia.

**Rituals**

The Court of Rains likes games much the way the Summer Court does; contests show who is powerful, who is dedicated, who is skilled, and who is determined. They also favor shows of excess, as these often provoke outrage, and have a particular love of food and drink. And every so often the Court feels the need to shake things up, ripping a band-aid off some issue and encouraging riots and trials. They've embraced as well the recent Summer Court tradition of a summer games, contests designed to allow everybody to show and show what they are best at. They look forward immensely to the coming of the Summer Olympics as a result.

Carnival also technically falls within the Cloud Court's time of rule, and though they defer to the Carnival Court on the management of it, they often provide protection and certainly enjoy its celebration. Rock in Rio, one of the largest concert events in the world, is sporadically held during the summer as well. Lastly, Rio's notorious New Year's Eve celebration, second in size only to Carnival, falls squarely during their reign.



**Heraldry**

The Court of Outrage displays itself proudly, daring its enemies to approach. The Courts colors the rich greens of the jungle, the deep, pure blues of the sea, the brilliant yellows of the sun, and always with just a splash of red for the Bloody Blade. Common symbols include bladed weapons, particularly swords and machetes, armored helms or shields, sunflowers, trees and vines, fire, the sea, a bounty of food or drink, often flowing openly, a bright sun or full moon, raindrops, predators such as the jaguar, anaconda, or caiman, iron or steel, a bloody pen or quill and a fist or just a bloody fist, and a severed arm. Single large, brightly-hued gems are also popular; rubies, sapphires, emeralds, colorful tourmaline and amber, set usually in gold or copper.



**Mantle**

The Rain Court's Mantle carries a sensation of pure, vibrant, wet heat, unrelenting like the high humidity of the region. Characters with Mantle 1 to 3 demonstrates aspects of heat and moisture in their seemings. Heat distortions, sweat, hot mists, and a general greenhouse feel are common. Mantle 4+ is even stronger ‚Äì people able to detect the seeming can feel a great physical heat rising from it, like being in a sauna rather than the dry heat of the Summer Court. Some can heat a cup of coffee with their hands, and seem almost feverish at times.

The Mantle powers of the Rain Court are the same as for the Summer Court; at 1, a Sapphire courtier adds +5 instead of +3 when spending a point of Willpower on a Strength-based roll. Mantle 3 provides a point of armor at all times against all dangers, stacking with any other armor, and at Mantle 5 they get one extra health level.



**Outrage**

Where the Summer Court focuses on Wrath, the Rain Court cultivates Outrage. Here is where one of the big differences between the two courts comes into play: The Court of Rains cares less about vengeance usually than justice. That is not to say that their motives are any more pure, but they focus less on how their enemies feel than how their enemies' victims feel, including themselves. They harness that anger and fury in their hearts to turn it back on those who have wronged them, and encourage others to do the same.

In that way, there is perhaps a little of envy and jealousy in their emotion at times, which helps to motivate them in contests, when seeking victory. They stoke their fires still for much the same reason as the Summer Court, with competitions and little outrages so that they will be ready to roar and rage when the big outrages come knocking at their door. They eschew complacency and feel uneasy over the prospect of ever fully being at peace.

Outrage is easy to find. They find it anywhere there is competition, anywhere where somebody is denied something they desire, where somebody else is taking something they want. They find it often in religion, particularly among those who feel they are better than others, and they find it in the sinful, who feel outrage at being judged. Politics, whether they're national, local, neighborhood, or company, are a hotbed of outrage. There is always somebody trying to clean up the streets, somebody angry at losing or being passed over or ignored again.

**The Court of Clouds**

(The Ebon Veil, the Silken Court, the Court of Loss)

(The Court of Fog, of Mists, of Night, of the Forgotten, of Memories,

of Breath, of Haze, of Doors, of Gates, of Dust, of Winter)



The Court of Clouds looks at the northern Winter Courts and believes it has found the true essence of winter; not sorrow, but Loss. After all, they ARE the Lost. They lost their lives, their identities, their forms, their memories. But, like all courts, they recognize duality; what is lost can be found again. This both excites and frightens them, for what if it is the True Fae doing the finding?

Unlike the Court of Rains, there are no sure or certain tales of the founding of this court; whether there ever were any or they, too, are lost, is a matter for debate. Some claim that the court simply materialized naturally to oppose the Court of Rains. Whatever the case, the Court of Clouds has its own pact with the seasons, and its own curious place in the scheme of things.

The Court of Clouds matches the Winter Court in matters of stealth. They fade like mist or fog or dust, leaving behind just an afterimage, something to be chased but nothing solid. They are masters of finding places to hide, whether abandoned buildings, forgotten corridors, or unoccupied hotel rooms. Often they MAKE these places forgotten through their magics and rituals, hiding them among the myriad other streets or homes or rooms. They move and float, difficult to pin down.

In a city of such vibrancy, they excel at making use of the chaos. Codes are passed along in songs and signs and simple rhythms overheard, and some dress in what others might consider surprisingly vibrant tones until they realize that the wearers are just blending in. Few know the ins and outs, the hidden depths, of the city better than they do.

The Cloud Court's defining feature, though, is still loss. They study it, embrace it, practice it, spread it. Many have learned to let go of material possessions, some by simply being ascetics but others by surrounding themselves with wealth and then as easily casting it aside. Impermanence is a major feature in their beliefs, their way of life. Some practice loss by taking, others by losing, and some by seeking, making the lost found.

Winter in Rio is both much drier and much cloudier, though there is still easily an inch or two of rain a month. It is not at all like winter in colder climes, though, so there is much less of the usual ice imagery. Instead, they often speak in terms of clouds and mists, fog and dust, silk and veils. They're fond of illusion, of haze and uncertainty.

The Cloud Court often deals in the reclamation of memories, and also the loss of them; there are some Changelings who WANT to leave behind their time in Arcadia. This too, they will allow, whether through an opium daze or a marijuana haze or stranger, more arcane methods.



Faith is a major element among all of the Courts, but particularly the Cloud Court; after all, terms like 'losing faith' and 'finding grace' are commonly associated with religion. Many belong to or associate with religious orders or people. Some gather in the lost and wandering, others deal with those who have newly found faith, and still others prefer those who have lost their faith; the Cloud Court easily claims the largest number of openly atheistic or agnostic Lost; the other Courts might have as many secular members, but they rarely make as much of a point about it as Cloud Courtiers. Some hide their true beliefs, too, in the typical Cloud Court way, so that one can't always be certain if a priest or monk or nun is devout or that 'godless heathen' is truly what she claims.



**Courtiers**

Unlike the Winter Court, most members of the Court of Clouds accept that they no longer are a part of the human world. Even when trying to blend in, they usually will do so more on their own terms, not on humanity's. Members of the Court are hiding, but they're also trying to understand the nature of loss, of what they were and what they have become. As such, many are introspective; some are drawn to religions or beliefs like Buddhism or Zen as a result.

They instead tend to present an image for humanity to see, a false face they can wear. Many go from one life to another, leaving behind what they were every so often. This suits thieves and con artists, and those who just generally don't wish to have too many attachments. Within the Court itself they are better able to keep track of each other, though the other Courts sometimes become confused by this.

In a city of major pageantry, some hide behind masks, too. Though normally seen as the purview of the Carnival Court, the Court of Clouds enjoys its disguises also, and is not above trying to hide among the garishness of the Carnival Court at all. This can make for interesting relations between the two courts.

The court is known for its aptitude as well in gathering information, and keeps watch on the Goblin Markets, exiled Fae, other supernaturals, and even the True Fae when they come to Earth. They might evade problems, but if they pass on what they know, then it becomes somebody else's problem and it will get dealt with without requiring their direct involvement.

They fill the same roles as Winter does largely; silent partner, observant but unobtrusive socialite, distant commander, stealthy assassin. Even those who stand out have layers upon layers.

Like the Winter Court, many newly-arrived Changelings join the Cloud Court while they are trying to work out their lives and hide from the Fae. The Cloud Court is perfectly okay with these new arrivals eventually leaving; that is part of Loss, after all.

Many Darklings and Wizened gravitate toward this Court, as well as more passive Beasts. Many who used stealth to escape Arcadia do as well. The Court's affinity with earth and air also draws Elementals and others with this attunement.



**Rituals**

The Court of Clouds enjoys its own version of the Winter Market called the Grand Bazaar. It is held on the new moon of each of the four months they are in control, and is something of a blend of the Winter Market and the Fallen Fair. The location changes every time, with the Cloud Court arranging the security and location, though the Rain Court often provides muscle. Cloud Courtiers see it as a time to divest themselves of their worldly goods, to let go of the things that bind them and all of the various items they've accumulated through the year, whether it is information or actual artifacts. As such, most of the sellers are usually from the Cloud Court, though most any Changeling can set up a booth. Goblins are strictly forbidden from doing so without a special writ.

With most of the city's major festivals happening during the Rain Court's rule, the Cloud Court has come to enjoy putting on its version of the more staid Winter Formal, which they call the Grand Ball, or Grande Baile.

The Cloud Courts maintain the Winter tradition of Radio Free Fae, in their cause called R√°dio Nuvem, or Radio Cloudburst. The broadcast originates somewhere in the favelas, always moving around, and is amplified via magic by the Christ the Redeemer statue to cover all of Rio. It includes news, weather reports in and out of the hedge, talk segments, debates, lists of new arrivals and current dangers, and Lost-made music and shows.



**Heraldry**

The Court of Loss is not quite as subtle as the Winter Court, but they still like to hide their symbols. Where the Court of Outrage prefers bold colors they go pale: light blue, soft green, cream and tan and gray and other pastel tones. Black and white sometimes interplay. For gems they prefer pale or light colors again; moonstone, white opal, turquoise, and pearls, usually set in silver or white gold. Veils, mists, dust, clouds, and fog are all common symbols, and sometimes birds, usually white or black. Ice and snow, something rarely seen in Rio, are sometimes used, as well as small animals such as insects and rodents, extinct or mythical animals (mostly local ones), a crescent moon, doors, a feather or folding fan, creeping vines, and a silver scepter. Soft materials and fabrics like silk, satin, lace, and velvet are especially favored.



**Mantle**

The Cloud Court's Mantle is a subtle thing, soft and crisp. At Mantle 1 to 3, it is like a soft breath, a sight, with a whisper of dust or mist when magic is used, a few motes whirling about. At higher levels it is a soothing coolness that becomes a whirl when magic is used; a dust devil, a swirl of fog, a rush of cold. Many seem comfortable no matter how hot it gets out.

At Mantle 1, an Ebon Courtier is more easily lost in a crowd, gaining the same ability the Winter Court does, subtracting 2 from any Wits + Composure or Wits + (Skill) rolls to notice the character. At Mantle 3, they had +2 to all Subterfuge rolls, and at 5 the -2 penalty becomes -4.



**Loss**

Silken Courtiers see their choice of emotion as more pure than that of the Winter Court. They embrace loss. Those who tell them loss is not an emotion are told to think of something they've lost, then to focus on that hollow feeling it engenders. The Cloud Court see themselves as the masters of this void, and its opposite, for what is Loss without discovery, without being found?

They embrace loss in many ways. They seek out those are lost, or who have lost. They help them come to terms, or help them to find what they've lost, depending. Many drift from life to life, self to self, casting aside their identity. Some change professions often, or join one that lets them blend in or disappear. Many are drawn to the clergy, where many who feel loss or are trying to find themselves go. Many find a certain peace in letting go, in casting things aside, in giving in to that void, while others are driven by it to discover, to find, to seek.

Loss is everywhere. In the questioning voice, the sorrowful heart, the forgotten past. Many of the Cloud Court learn to use subtle scents and perfumes, for they have learned that scent is the strongest trigger of memory. They have equally learned that by eliminating scents, they can more easily obscure memory. Many gravitate toward the clergy, as those dealing with loss often seek answers in religion. The large secular population in Rio is also a boon for the Cloud Court, for lack of belief, denial, and loss of faith are all useful to them. Many also have come to recognize the signs of loss in overworking, in drug and alcohol abuse, in frenzied laughter to cover pain. To the Cloud Court, all of it is subtle variations of a flavor.





**The Court of Carnival**

(The Brilliant Mask, the Shining Court, the Court of Passion)

(The Court of Masks, of Faces, of Costumes, of Festivals, of Windows, of Borders)



The Court of Carnival was the final Court to join the cycle in Rio. As the first two were founded out of a conflict between two sides, so was the third. The original two were founded in 1822 when the two sides of a conflict rooted in the arrival of the Portuguese royal court, fleeing Napoleon's armies, created an imbalance between the Changelings arriving with them and the ones already present.

In time, though, imbalance grew again. Brazil was long a slave state, and over time many who returned began to empathize with the slaves and the poor, remaining Courtless and joining them during their revelries and festivals. Chief among these was Carnival, which grew progressively wilder and began to include much pageantry involving irony and sarcasm to express the growing unrest and desire for freedom. Hand in hand with the movements for abolition and democracy, the cause of the Courtless grew. They clashed with the two Courts, until finally a compromise was reached in 1888; with the Courtless threatening to shake the world of the Lost to its foundations, a place was made for them by ceding the brief Spring and Autumn seasons and granting them control of Carnival. That same year, slavery was abolished, and a year later Brazil became a republic.

The founders of the Court of Carnival were many: the German, Deatheater Bento, Madoula the Bat, Aldina Porcelana, the Buccaneer Yverneau, and more. It has often been a court for misfits and foreigners, for those who don't fit in elsewhere. It is also a court of change, of between times and holidays, of windows and boundaries, moving between worlds as it moves between the other two courts.

While technically the Court of Carnival is accorded as much of the year as the other two, it feels like less because it is broken up into two parts. They do not mind, this, though, as it is fitting to the dual nature of their Court, and because they are ceded something else: Carnival and other major festivals. While most of these happen during the months of the other Courts, the Carnival Court handles Lost preparation and involvement in such major events as Carnival, New Year's Eve, and Rock in Rio.

The Masked Courtiers use deception, passion, and ritual to help hide the Lost from the True Fae. Masks and costumes confound them as much as vivid emotions, but rituals do as well. Discipline is known to most of the Others, and time is a strange concept as well, so the yearly festivals with all of their rigorous preparations and intricate ceremonies are particularly baffling. The Carnival Court facilitates this all, and then watches over their fellow Lost, both local and visiting, keeping an eye on them as they became satiated and saturated with Glamour.

Spring and Autumn are both short seasons in Rio, fleeting and ephemeral. This suits the Carnival Court, for they feel that passion is often the same, and surely the festivals they enjoy are as well. They are all escapes for the normal, from longer periods. Spring and Autumn are less differentiated in Rio than in much of the United States. Autumn sees it get gradually cooler and the rains lessen over time. Spring sees the temperatures rise again and the rains pick up toward the end. Other than that, though, it is a fairly, humid place year round.



**Courtiers**

Once upon a time members of the Carnival Court came largely from the streets and dispossessed, but these days can come from any part of the city. The festivals belong to all, and so does the Carnival Court, they say.

The Court does not attract any one type of person. Some join it simply to focus on the festivals, looking to lose themselves in emotion and partying; this is a fairly simplistic reason and those who don't learn a little wisdom often burn out or disappear. Many who join dwell between worlds. Some live double lives, others venture in to the hedge, others are nomadic or pursue professions that take them to many places.

Unsurprisingly, a great many artists and crafters are drawn to the Carnival Court. Musicians, tailors, chefs and brewers; the Carnival Court easily has the largest number of Wizened. The Court's inheritance of aspects of desire, fear, and magic also means that many within it study mysticism. Quite a few are drawn to the many spiritual paths in Rio, including many religions and mystical beliefs. Others seek out professions that allow them to experience or give thrills. Daredevil, explorer, pilot, crazy cab driver, hang glider rentals, wedding planner; they are needed all over.



**Rituals**

The most sacred of all of the Masked Courtiers' events is obviously Carnival. A massive event taking nearly a week, preparation for it can last for months before. They work within and around the many crews, all across the city, coordinating with the other Courts and even to an extent with other supernaturals to insure that the festival is not disrupted. Some take part, others keep watch, often rotating duties. Glamour flows line wine during this time, so many of their fellow Lost get drunk on it and need the aid of friends in the Carnival Court to find their ways safely home.

The massive New Year's Eve festival, centered mostly in the Zona Sul, also falls under their purview, as does the big Rock in Rio concert event. This last is not always held in Rio, despite its name, but started there and most often returns to this city.

The first two occur during Rio's summer, while the third can vary; its first three years in 1985, 1991, and 2001 were all in January, but the 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017 versions all occurred (or will occur in our timeline) in September, the last month of Rio's winter.

Aside from these, any other truly major events that come along fall under their watch. These include such rare spectacles as the 2014 World Cup game and the upcoming 2016 Summer Olympics.

The other courts also sometimes call on the Court of Carnivals to aid in their own festivals in places. With so many duties, the Court does not feel the need to run any of their own festivals, as they feel part of so many already.



**Heraldry**

The Court of Passion is bright and brilliant. Masks are a primary theme, along with makeup and costumery. They often deal in color and heavy contrast; fireworks, rhinestones, glitter, sequins, painted feathers, rich embroidery, vibrant pageantry. They prefer costume jewelry to the real thing, with plenty of garish accessories; except for diamonds. Diamonds are something of a joke for the Court, who recognize that their value is greatly inflated.

Other symbols include the many brightly-colored birds and monkeys of the region, rainbows, sheaves of wheat, bushels of harvested fruit, an eyeglass, looking glass, or magnifying glass, ribbons, a quill, a brush, a sewing needle, or other artisan's tools. Every day objects are often gilded or otherwise heavily decorated, such as a golden needle. They also value the numbers six, sixty-six, and sixty seven, due to the time between the founding of the first two courts and theirs.

Though they do not have a monopoly on music, the performing arts as a whole are especially important to this court and so musical instruments and symbols abound.

They don't hold to any specific colors like the other two courts, but more a riot of them. Some symbols, such as fans, feathers, and masks, are shared with the Court of Clouds, but the difference between the two is immediately apparent, as the Carnival Court's are always far more decorated and colorful.



**Mantle**

The Carnival Court's Mantle is very similar to that of the Directional Courts' South Court. It radiates a certain heat that excites the pulse, just a little shiver, a small jolt and bit of wonder for those with Mantle 1 to 3. At 4+ it becomes a rich thrum, and wherever they go people find themselves giving in to their Virtues and Vices more openly. Some even shimmer or gleam, every little glint of light magnified.

Consummate showmen, Masked Courtiers get +2 to any Expression rolls at Mantle 1. Masked Courtiers easily connect with others, and at Mantle 3 purchase Allies and Contacts at half cost. At Mantle 5 Masked Courtiers come to recognize others wearing masks; they gain the powers of the Merit Unseen Sense, normally reserved for mortals, but only with things NOT of the Fae. This ability is one reason the Carnival Court is the one most often to deal with other supernaturals in the city.



**Passion**

The Passion of the Carnival Court is related to but different than that of the Directional Courts' South Court. The Carnival Court chose to fuse together the abilities of Autumn and Spring. Where the powers of Eternal Spring and Autumn went to the Courts of Rains and Clouds respectively, the Carnival Court got both Fleeting Spring and Autumn, as well as Verdant Spring and Spellbound Autumn, allowing them to work with two emotions that at first some might see as very different: fear and desire.

The Masked Courtiers do not see things so, though. They recognize that fear and desire often walk hand-in-hand, such as the heart-pounding uncertainty of a new crush or the thrill of riding a roller coaster. As such, they tend to deal with one extreme of the emotion, that heady, rushed sensation of not quite knowing what might happen next.

Novices of the court might see their emotion as fleeting, a temporary high that comes and goes swiftly, and it is true that its heights do so, but more experienced members learn that there is a build up to that moment of discovery, of a thrill, that if done properly can be drawn out and harnessed deliciously. A horror movie foreshadows, an eager courtier works up the courage, a hang glider stares down in wonder before taking the leap, and a partier... plans.

Since they're so heavily invested in working on the biggest festivals of Rio society, they've learned about the thrill of anticipation and competition, of the crews working together and planning and building. There is the desire to build something bigger and better, the fear when things go wrong, the drive to top their rivals, the warm sense of camaraderie in working together. This is truly their strongest field, and they know how to feed upon and draw from anticipation for as long as possible, to get them through the lean times between when they must subsist on smaller thrills.

**New Entitlement: The Scions of the Old Empire**

Exclusive to Rio, the Scions were originally founded by noble members of the Cloud Court after the establishment of the two courts as a way of remembering their origins among the elite nobility of Portugal. When Brazil became its own Empire, the members of the entitlement were torn; some favored inviting select members of the Court of Rains to join, while others felt none among the locals could possibly be deserving. In the end, there was a schism and the faction for inclusion won out; the entitlement stepped out of the shadows and opened their doors to the Court of Rains as well.

They have never accepted the Court of Carnival, though, as its rise came with the conversion of the country to democracy. The Scions see themselves as the last bastion of old ideas of courtly etiquette and chivalry, and strive for positions of leadership in the belief that having their own class of nobility confounds the True Fae, who see themselves as above all and don't fully understand the concept of a hierarchy.

**Titles:** Unlike most Entitlements, the Scions have an elaborate system of titles based on the old degrees of nobility used by the Portuguese. Others often refer to them collectively as Scions, and they are sometimes known as the Lost Court, a title that is very purposely ambiguous. More on their full scheme of titles is under Organization (below).

**Prerequisites:** Wyrd 3, Mantle 3 or higher in the Court of Rains or Clouds.

**Joining:** Since the Lost can't have children, hereditary titles are meaningless to them. There is also little point in trying to trace lineages; most among the Lost have forgotten who and what they were. The original members were those few who had found their ways back into their old lives or otherwise committed deeds that raised them up into the nobility of Portugal. Now, in order to join, an enterprising Changeling must find a sponsor from among the current membership. If deemed worthy, a title is conferred beneath that of their sponsor, and the hopeful becomes their apprentice of sorts, heir apparent to their title. In such a way, many of the titles of the Scions have been passed down for generations, though new ones are sometimes created as demand or merit warrants.

**Mien:** Every member of the Scions has their own Coat of Arms, most derived from the early nobility they came from, some that have risen since. When a new inheritor is accepted, they take their patron's coat of arms and add something personal to it. Because of this, the oldest Coats of Arms have become truly elaborate, revealing in their many devices each past holder. Members always wear their coat of arms in some fashion, whether as an elaborate pin, an embroidered design, or even a printed shirt. Otherwise, most tend to adopt the fashions of the rich and noble, often melding old and new together in their own eclectic designs. Some favor a more archaic approach while others go entirely modern. Always present somewhere, though, is a blue cross, often fashioned of five stones or pieces, symbolizing the Five Quinas of the Portuguese Coat of Arms. The use of gemstones or studs to create this cross is a popular option.

The Five Quinas is more than a symbol; it becomes a part of the Lost's mien, actually fusing with their flesh over time. Though it often seems to be worn on clothing, it is actually mystically protruding through the clothing from their skin beneath, where it becomes embedded. Some few openly bear their crosses in a place that is uncovered, such as the back of the hand or even their face. It is possible to hide the Five Quinas, but the Changeling must actively and purposely do so, and whatever has been used to cover them must then physically be removed to reveal them.

**Background:** While some characterize the Scions as social climbers, Lost join for many reasons. One of the largest is looking for somewhere to belong. People hold the nobility with a certain fascination, and this can be found as the roots of entitlements in general to some extent. There is a love of being elite.

The Scions have places for all sorts; those of Physical, Mental, and Social prowess. They have their knights, their strategists, and their charmers, and often seek a balance among the three, though rarely within individuals. Rather, each has their role.

**Organization:** As Scions of the Old Empire, this entitlement has no one ruler; rather, they answer to the idea of an Emperor long gone. Instead, the five Royal Dukes act as a Regent Council, guiding their fellow Scions and offering advice to the current reigning Monarchs of the Courts.

Each of the Royal Dukes claims a part of the city, though this is mostly a nominal claim. They divide it up into the Centro, Norte, Sul, Oeste, and Este regions. Este is the bay and Sugarloaf Mountain, where the goblin market takes place, and the Royal Duke of the East, or Duque Real do Leste, is typically seen as a figure of respect within the goblin market.

Below them there are a number of Dukes (Duque or Duquesa), Marquis (Marqu√™s), Counts (Conde or Condessa), Viscounts (Visconde or Viscondessa), Barons (Bar√£o or Baronesa), Lords (Lorde or Lordesa), and Fidalgos. All below Royal Dike also must work their way up the two Orders, which further determines prestige, each with three degrees. The First Order has the three grades of Fidalgo Cavaleiro, Fidalgo Eescudeiro, and Mo√ßo Fidalgo, the second Order has the grades of Cavaleiro Fidalgo, Escudeiro Fidalgo, and Mo√ßo da C√¢mara. An initiate begins as a Mo√ßo da C√¢mara, the third grade of the Second Order, no matter how high up their patron or starting title, and moves up the orders on the dint of their deeds and services to the Lost Court and the Courts of Rio. If this all seems quite confusing to outsiders, imagine how bedeviling it is to the True Fae, who could never imagine willingly making themselves subservient to another.

Rather than list out all of the possible individual titles around, I am going to leave this largely open for now, for players to have fun with as they see fit.

**Concepts:** Favela warlord, influential socialite, carnival royalty, famous singer, crusading general, media baron.

**Privileges:** The Excellence of Nobility ‚Äì Choose a single Skill. So long as the Scion's Five Quinas are not being hidden, they gain the bonus of 9 again on all rolls made with it, or 8 again if they already get 9 again. This is only for mundane uses of the skill, not contracts, though a contract could be used to enhance the roll. This skill is chosen at the time of admittance to the entitlement; it can not change and should fit with the Changeling's chosen role among this elite nobility.

Is their relationship normal, and would I be wasting my time trying to get this to change?","I met the girl (29F) who I'm (30M) dating on an app around 3 months ago and I think we're a great match for lots of reasons. From the beginning, she was honest about how she shares a dog with her ex, and that the dog is an important part of her life.

Their relationship ended around 7/8 months before I met her, and they'd been together for 2 years. The idea of her still being in touch with him felt a bit strange, but I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt however, as time progresses I'm realising they're still closer than I'd like.

She normally sees him 2/3 times a week, to either collect the dog or return him, but sometimes they do other stuff too like have lunch/coffee/dinner and take him for a walk together. I've also recently become aware of quite how much they still talk to each other - it is a full, daily text conversation, not limited to just arranging dog things.

On Christmas Eve, we went drinking with a group of her friends I'd never met, so it was nice that she felt comfortable introducing me to them. I overheard her having a conversation with one of her friends about her outfit, and how she wanted to wear a different dress but it's still at her ex's house. I asked her what she meant but this and although she clearly didn't want to say, it turns out she still has a lot of belongings at his place.

My friends think I should be a bit firmer about this and set boundaries, but it seems pretty clear to me that given the importance of this dog in her life I'd just be wasting everyone's time. My view is that regardless of the reason, I'm within my rights to not feel comfortable getting more serious with someone who is this close to their ex.

Has anyone ever dealt with this sort of scenario in a healthy way, or would I be wasting my time even trying?

1hoysqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/economicCollapse/comments/1hoysqa/the_working_class_is_stupid_and_i_understand_why/,"The working class is stupid, and I understand why the rich disrespect them","


I understand why the rich enslave the poor because the working class is actually okay with being slaves for the rest of their lives.

The working class is stupid and delusional. They believe the fairytales that hard work, ambition, and perseverance will make them rich.  
And the ""plebs"" believe that. Every single poor person believes that work will make them free.  

It is completely understandable why the rich despise the poor.  

When the rich spit on the poor, the poor are sure it‚Äôs raining. They are that stupid.  

The poor will cry that they work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, have no free time, and earn too little.  
And yet, at the same time, they‚Äôll go to McDonald‚Äôs or Starbucks to buy overpriced coffee. They make the rich richer because the idea of buying something from the rich makes them feel elite.  

Instead of supporting their working-class people, they‚Äôd rather buy from enemy -big corporations  to feel elite. They‚Äôll buy clothes from Louis Vuitton to feel prestigious, still supporting the rich.  

Even though workers at Amazon have poor working conditions and low wages, the working class keeps buying from Amazon, and the cycle never ends.  They don't bother about that how bad employees are treated. They won't unite with their class, becouse they are actually ashamed of being associated with poor. That's why people will brag about their perfect life on social media, despite being poor. 


At work, instead of coming together, there are always bootlickers who want to climb the ladder and get promoted. They exploit their colleagues and take advantage of them for personal gain. Instead of uniting, they tear each other down.  

The same goes for soldiers and police. They earn ridiculously little but still protect the rich because they are brainwashed into believing that in 10 years, they‚Äôll be promoted and become wealthier.  

Wars are possible becouse all these poor belive if they will be submissive they will be promoted and eventually become rich.


If the working class were united against the rich, they wouldn‚Äôt have to wait 10, 20, or 30 years to afford the house and live their dream life. If the working class united, they could dictate conditions, and companies would be ruined without workers. Without people, these companies are worthless.  
However, the working class is stupid to the bone.  

This is the last call because soon, AI will replace labor. This is the ultimate goal of the rich. The rich need a workforce to generate profits, and they depend on people. But when they successfully replace labor with AI, it will be the ultimate end for the working class. All the money will accumulate in the hands of the rich, and the rest of you will die of starvation.

I‚Äôm really disgusted by those people who are saying that Luigi Mangione did wrong because Thomphos didn‚Äôt deserve to be killed, that he deserved a rightful jury, and that Luigi had no right to deliver justice himself.

This is a blatant example of a slave mentality‚Äîa bootlicker who was told fairytales about being a ""good human"" and going to heaven. They‚Äôve been indoctrinated into believing that nobody has the right to deliver justice themselves, and they cling to the idea that being a ""good person"" will eventually be rewarded.

But they fail to see or realize that the rich don‚Äôt follow these so-called rules of being good. The rich live like the rules are for the poor, not for them. They have no ethical code. They enslave the poor, exploit them, and build a world designed for the wealthy.

And when a single poor person takes action against the rich, these same poor slaves condemn it, calling it ""wrongful."" They believe the rich follow the same ethics as everyone else, so they think they too must follow the rules and be obedient sheep.

The rich kill people daily. They send the poor to wars, using them as tools, and don‚Äôt care about their lives.  

The rich will never mourn the life of a soldier who dies on the battlefield. To them, his life was worthless.

The difference between the rich and the poor is this: when the poor kill a rich person, there will always be dumb poor slaves who mourn the rich, saying it was ""wrong"" and ""unethical."" They believe in fairness and justice even when the system is rigged against them. The poor dumb and fully deserve to be slaves. They are slaves becouse in fact they are okay with being slaves.",0,1735487663.0,economicCollapse,6,0.39,False

My friend of 6 years started to use me as her therapist and it was draining me so badly. I work in a hospital and have to have a smile on for patients daily and take on their stressors and then I'd come home and have my 'friend' vent to me constantly about ridiculous situations. 

'my sister drank my coffee' -33 messages of this
'my sister wanted my perfume' -52 messages of this
'my sister creased my ¬£700 handbag' -45 messages of this. 


These are messages all in a row. I was so sick of it that I put up a boundary and said. 

' I love you so much but please can we try get you some professional help, because I'm struggling to take this all on me when I am drained from work' 

She took this in a bad way and continued to say I am not supportive or a good friend and that 'God is watching me' 

Honestly my heart broke, my friend is physically disabled and I'm pretty much her only friend. I'd drive down 1.5 hour to see her often, reply to every single ridiculous message and do whatever I could to support her. 

She couldn't handle me putting one boundary for my mental health. 

I tried to end things nicely and she ended up hating on me. I simply sent her a positive affirmation and said to take care of herself. Them blocked her before she could call me anything else. 

I just feel so low because I feel I get taken advantage of in every friendship I have. 

I had a best friend for 2 years who left me once she got a boyfriend. That broke me even worse. If I can get through that, I guess I can get through this. 

I'm tired of pouring my heart and soul into people who don't reciprocate.

Hope you all are happy and healthy.

Been a while since I posted here. Trying yet again - here's to optimism and not giving up.

I am a 35 year old single nerd (yes, very unique on reddit), both in personal and professional life. I am an expat living in the Netherlands but originally from India(oh dear, Indian, run away!! )

Still here?... well read on..

I have been away from home for more than 12 years, for both educational and professional reasons. Last 2 years were spent in the Netherlands. I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been more than a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am looking for a connection - be it just friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but there is much work to be done. The latter part has been harder as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within short distances.

**executive summary:**  *there is hope.  I was very much afflicted by levofloxacin, but two years on, I feel great!*

Hi all- I've been meaning to check in here, but I was not and am not generally a reddit user except for the period of time beginning exactly two years ago this month, when I was initially ""floxed."" That's the sum total of my reddit experience.  So, I forget about reddit! Also - and this is the hopeful part - what you've read here is true:  people like me recover and then they forget to check in here.  In other words, you may think you're doomed at first, because so many of the stories here are grim and ongoing.  But the data are biased. You're not hearing from the all selfish asses like me, who got better and forgot to tell you so.

Two years ago, I was devastated, facing terrible pain and very limited mobility for the first time in a half century of life. The anxiety over what my future held was horrific.  But I progressed - in fits and starts - over that first year.  Now, two years later, I feel truly recovered. I rock climb, mountain bike, hike big mountains, cross-country ski, help people move heavy stuff, etc etc.  Just as before the ""floxing.""

The only notable difference is that I'm no longer a runner.  I used to run religiously, including an ultramarathon just before I got floxed.  But a very old 'micro-tear' injury in my left achilles' tendon was re-ignited by the floxing.  I've tried to re-integrate running into my routine, but I only get up to a one mile (2K) run and then I suffer a bit of soreness and/or limping for days or weeks afterward.  Honestly, this mild achilles tendonitis struggle really parallels the way the original injury played out, where it took me several years to get fully get back to running.  So, I'm still hopeful I'll be back up to at least 10K trail runs in the next couple of years.

At age 53, it's hard to figure out which random aches and pains are the result of the floxing and which are just part of aging.  And that uncertainty is a good thing!  Floxing didn't ruin me, time did. But it was only time that also healed me.

I briefly quit coffee and alcohol on advice I saw here.  I tried all the supplements.  But now I drink tons of coffee and I drink and get drunk and hungover occasionally, as before.  I don't take any supplements or medications.   My life is as before.  There's hope for you if you've just been floxed - I'm living proof!  Best of luck.",1,1735487387.0,floxies,0,1.0,False

This builds on the idea that the game is literally set in hell, but instead of walker dying in the helicopter crash, the actual death of the protagonist is the opening scene of Konrad pouring himself a cup of coffee and staring out at Dubai (and then shooting himself ofc). The idea of him being walker is to experience the nightmare of the world he created with fresh eyes, casting himself as some random soldier he saved in Kabul.

‚ÄúThis one would like to congratulate you on getting this ship safely into orbit.‚Äù Meadow Muffin said with a chirp. 

‚ÄúI thought you said I‚Äôd be co-piloting that!‚Äù I said to Villi Kersch.  

Villi wistfully looked at the minibar she had next to her chair, but she flashed me what looked like an incredibly smug look instead of opening it. 

‚ÄúIf anything went wrong we were both here to help, and besides, I wanted to keep an eye on these sensor readings.‚Äù Villi replied coolly. ‚ÄúBesides, you‚Äôve launched in atmosphere before.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. Given the patchwork repairs we did to get here, I was not pleased with Villi suddenly having me pilot us to orbit, but the next step we were going to take was equally daunting. We were going to make sure the satellite guarding the planet would let us return next time by deactivating its defenses. 

‚ÄúSpeaking of the sensor readings, are you picking up anything from that orbital defense platform? I should probably get Scheya up here so we can talk with this thing.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou really think it could tell the difference between our translators and a live Sellyn?‚Äù Villi asked dismissively. 

‚ÄúThis one is starting to wonder if you read any of the summaries I wrote  . If it is required we could go over the full reports in detail.‚Äù Meadow Muffin said. For a moment it sounded like she lacked her normal cheerfulness too. 

I couldn‚Äôt blame her. We had spent a lot of time setting working on making return trips to this planet safe for others. Danger aside, I imagined it also meant a lot to Meadow Muffin  as well, considering her career was probably on the line. 

Villi Kirsch looked down at her systems console, as if she was trying to avoid setting Meadow Muffin off further. 

‚ÄúUh, Meadow Muffin, can you take a look at these readings?‚Äù Villi said with some alarm. 

I looked at the screen, but seeing both of Meadow Muffin‚Äôs antennae stop out of the corner of my eye distracted me. 

‚ÄúThis one would like to confirm if the sensors were calibrated properly or not.‚Äù 

That was an odd statement consider she had done the work on the sensors herself. 

‚ÄúThey read fine on the pre-flight check. Clearing orbit would have been way more difficult if there were any issues. What do you two see?‚Äù I asked as I stared at my screen trying to understand. 

Villi Kersch got out of her seat and pulled out a bottle of some dark brown fluid before walking over to me.  Tapping on the view controls the readings changed. 

‚ÄúThis is a view of all the recent hyperspace trails in the system .‚Äù Villi said as she pointed awkwardly with the bottle in hand. She was clenching onto it like it was her lifeline. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs more is that these exits are rapid. They‚Äôre all blueshifted far more than you‚Äôd normally see on transports or other civilian craft on an approach.‚Äù 

There were dozens of contacts on the screen. And since sensor data was all in real space, that meant that even if any of this was fresh data, it had happened several hours ago. Light latency meant there could be more. And they were heading towards the planet, or more likely towards the satellite we were planning on visiting. 

‚ÄúMeadow Muffin, what galactic powers would have a fleet this big?‚Äù Villi asked while she started to pace around the bridge.  

I flipped over to comms and started checking for any hints of chatter. The silence was odd, even more so since we had expected the satellite to try to communicate with us. 

‚ÄúThis one could name each, but analyzing the data further would yield a better answer. I will send results to the main screen as they are matched to known trail patterns.‚Äù 

Continuing to pace around, Villi brushed her own antennae back, her face looking particularly colorful due to her Nimeccu biology before looking at the main screen. ‚ÄúThis is a hodgepodge of ships, not a school. What are the odds they‚Äôre being camouflaged? I‚Äôve seen the Grabbun do that in a fight.‚Äù 

The screen had a lot of different signatures, and was struggling to list them all, but it looked primarily like Calaxian forces, and their allies based on the labels. Even with all the homework I had done for my diplomatic work, I was no expert on fleet configurations outside of the basics, so I felt really out of my depth. Even so, I could tell this was a large force. 

Calaxians also meant we ran the risk of their disparate factions with their own designs on things. I thought back to the group that had tried to abduct me and had caught Mica instead. 

‚ÄúThis one wouldn‚Äôt assume trail masking. It doesn‚Äôt produce results similar to other known types like we are seeing.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat about a coalition?‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúDifferent groups working together towards a common cause could result in a variety of vessels being sent.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any patterns that match known Verminaut Bureaucracy designs.‚Äù Villi muttered. 

I looked at her screen and started to make sense of what we were seeing. Blue shifting meant it was coming in our direction, or at least that of the planet. Based on the speed and distance the screen was assigning to each contact, they were coordinating to show up around the same time, and that was going to be very soon. 

‚ÄúA force this large could only be here to take out that weapons platform.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve not heard any radio chatter from them or the platform which also doesn‚Äôt bode well. We need to change course right away, maybe break orbit and run silent.‚Äù 

If they weren‚Äôt broadcasting they weren‚Äôt negotiating, not that I needed to spell that the details from a lengthy interstellar treaty to Villi or Meadow Muffin to make that clear. 

‚ÄúIf we break orbit won‚Äôt that thing fire at us if we come back? That wasn‚Äôt the deal we made with the Sellyn. You really want to strand Scheya off their home planet?‚Äù 

I guess Villi did read Meadow Muffin‚Äôs notes. She paced a bit more and awkwardly adjusted her jacket. ‚ÄúI can change our orbit to something a bit safer. If we‚Äôre not being looked at it might even trick them into thinking we‚Äôre a captured asteroid. It will be a bit risky, military ships tend to have better sensors than most.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your call.‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúThis one survived landing on the planet once, and will defer to your judgement Nimeccu Villi Kersch.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo need to be so formal.‚Äù Villi sighed, as she sat down in her chair, setting her bottle down, still unopened. ‚ÄúKeep an eye on the sensors and comms, I‚Äôll take care of things here.‚Äù 

I sent a message to Mica relaying what was going on, since the last thing I needed was for Scheya or Odette to panic. Then I started scouring everything in front of me, be it comms or hyperspace signatures. 

It was eerily silent, but the pattern matches piled up further. There were dozens of ships converging to fight the same thing that had managed to ground us from orbit without destroying our ship, and managed to take out a Verminaut capital ship. A lack of communications, even encrypted ones, was a bit foreboding. 

I wondered what the satellite was ‚Äòthinking‚Äô about the situation as well. There had been no communication from it yet either. 

I could hear Villi sigh and tap on her unopened bottle as we completed course adjustment maneuvers. Peeking out I could see Meadow Muffin‚Äôs elytra twitching a bit as she brushed at her antennae while continuing to manipulate her readouts as well.  I hoped the tense atmosphere didn‚Äôt extend to Mica and the others. 

‚ÄúHow long until all these contacts show up in orbit?‚Äù I asked. 

Meadow Muffin took a moment to get the information before replying, ‚ÄúThis one estimates a coordinated rendezvous within effective range of the defense platform by the time we have nearly completed a full orbit.‚Äù 

Given the timing I was glad Villi had changed our course. The further away we were from any fighting the better. 

‚ÄúI bet the Calaxians have an observation post out here somewhere at the edges of the system if they know where their target is.‚Äù Villi added, ‚ÄúEven if the combatants don‚Äôt notice us, it will, so we better hope any fighting doesn‚Äôt last several hours. The last thing we need is to get swept up in this situation when we‚Äôre so close to getting out of here.‚Äù 

Given the Calaxian ships that had jumped into the star system we were in, it seemed obvious in retrospect. While not directly confrontational with the Verminauts they weren‚Äôt staunch allies either. 

I thought about what I knew about the Calaxian Plumbage. Spying and diplomacy was more their field of expertise. As for starting a fight? 

I swiped through the list of hyperspace signatures we had collected so far, looking at the ships not matching Calaxian designs. 

‚ÄúWhat if this force is made mostly of Calaxian ships because they started going early?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThe early bird gets the worm?‚Äù  

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never heard anyone describe it like that, but it could fit some of the tactics I‚Äôve seen Calaxian security patrols use.‚Äù Villi Kersch said. ‚ÄúThe other ships were probably assigned with them in battlegroups and jumped with them to avoid breaking formation. If we are expecting more ships trying to catch up, they‚Äôll probably be jumping in much closer to make up for the early birds. Assuming we‚Äôre not already seeing some hasty jumps into the star system already.‚Äù 

I looked for any newer signatures, but Meadow Muffin must have been faster to check. 

‚ÄúThis one can confirm the most recent signatures are fairly new. If the defense platform continues to react like it has previously, we should start hearing radio transmissions soon.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep an open channel.‚Äù I replied. I was already monitoring for it, and anything else that came through radio or even hyperspace transmissions. 

The only ‚Äòtransmission‚Äô I had received so far was from Mica asking me to keep him in the loop if anything else happened. I wondered if he even told Odette anything was going on. At least he was probably keeping Scheya calm. 

As our orbit rounded the planet the comms burst into static, breaking the silence. I started to adjust it down, but I could hear words coming through. 

‚ÄúHostile‚Ä¶‚Äù was all I could hear at first, but there was too much static. At least now I understood it was transmitting in a dialect of the Sellyn language, although that was likely not the same as the language of its makers. 

I could see Meadow Muffin furiously manipulating her controls, and Villi Kersch poised in her seat to maneuver the ship if necessary. 

Despite my efforts, I felt like it was more a result of a better position to receive than anything I had done to clear up the signal when I heard the next intelligible message. 

‚Äú‚Ä¶are on alert. This‚Ä¶‚Äù

Static returned and I instinctively gave the side of the console I was at a whack that probably didn‚Äôt help, but the message cut in again regardless. 

‚Äú‚Ä¶under protection. Hostiles will be destroyed with extreme prejudice.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI think our chances of safely disabling that thing are gone. If they destroy it we can get Scheya back later after we sort out the diplomatic situation at least.‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúNot a bad assessment, but if we try to leave now we will be detected by these warships. We‚Äôre going to need to look for a better opportunity or they might just try to capture us‚Ä¶ or try to shoot us down.‚Äù Villi said. 

Meadow Muffin also added her thoughts, ‚ÄúThis one doubts the current force could successfully contest this conflict. The weapons on these frigates and destroyers are likely not enough to win a war of attrition.‚Äù 

Villi looked at Meadow Muffin with exasperation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not seriously suggesting we try to approach it if all these ships lose the fight are you?‚Äù 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just do what we can to stay safe and we‚Äôll worry about the other details later.‚Äù I suggested. 

‚ÄúThis one suggests being ready for that sooner rather than later. I have obtained a visual confirmation of the ships approaching the defense platform and they‚Äôre almost in known effective weapons range for Calaxian ships.‚Äù 

I turned my attention to the screen.

At this distance we would have never found them without knowing where to look from the hyperspace signatures, but Meadow Muffin wasn‚Äôt joking about a visual confirmation. The details weren‚Äôt perfect, but I was able to see a fleet of Calaxian Plumage ships, including their telltale markings. 

‚ÄúComms just picked up a short databurst sent to hyperspace from those ships.‚Äù I advised as I got the alert. I didn‚Äôt need to review the message to know what it was saying, because the ships were already powering up their weapons. 

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre starting the attack.‚Äù Villi muttered. 

A moment later the attack did indeed start, but not from the Calaxian ships. Multiple beams of energy shot through the Calaxian ships like a lance. As it burned through their hulls the ships exploded in the colors only burning metal could produce, little more than fireworks announcing the beginning of the show. 

Radio communications started to light up our comms as well, primarily Calaxians, but with other parties chiming in. The lack of any real encryption lent itself to this being a hastily assembled coalition for different groups. The Calaxians were singing what sounded like ballad, although it was broken up by voices occasionally cutting out. 

As the lightshow progressed the shear multitude of Calaxian ships did manage to get some shots off, but it didn‚Äôt seem very effective because it didn‚Äôt stop or slow the satellite from continuing to methodically destroy the Calaxian fleet. I hoped the Sellyn wouldn‚Äôt panic from the growing lightshow above their planet. 

‚ÄúThis one is picking up fresh hyperspace exit patterns.‚Äù Meadow Muffin announced, ‚ÄúVarious matches, Grabbun, Zaklug‚Ä¶ Helix.‚Äù  

I turned my attention to the display listing those and noticed it was still populating. Between light lag and much closer hyperspace exits the screen was no longer just storing information but rapidly scrolling through it. I had a feeling Meadow Muffin would still be listing ship types if she hadn‚Äôt trailed off with venom at the sight of the Helix Mana showing up to this fight as well. 

Comms grew increasingly active, and we heard more and more about what was going on. Villi seemed to intently be listening to some chatter that sounded like a Grabbun dialect. 

Villi Kersch finally opened the bottle she had been clutching. She looked at it, then looked at me before imbibing some, ‚ÄúLooks like your theory about a coalition was on the bottle.‚Äù She continued after a moment, ‚ÄúThe Calaxians, or at least the ones that haven‚Äôt been blown up by that thing, are getting an earful about starting the fight early. It looks like they disrupted the planned attack.‚Äù 

Meadow Muffin added her commentary as well. ‚ÄúThis one finds it concerning that the Grabbun wouldn‚Äôt just call off a botched attack. They must be heavily invested in the attack for them to ignore a lack of discipline like that. But the force so far has been made of masses of smaller ships, mostly older designs with retrofitted weapon arrays.‚Äù 

Listening in further, Villi Kersch grimaced. ‚ÄúIt seems like they‚Äôre here because they watched that Verminaut ship go down. They want what your lot was after Meadow Muffin.‚Äù 

That explained the lack of Verminaut ships. In fact, the whole battle seemed like a cluster of rivals, their allies, and opportunistic mercenaries. 

I listened into the parts Villi Kersch was, trying to see if my translator would catch anything important. Something beyond the famous grouchiness of the Grabbun as they coordinated their forces. 

More and more ships jumped into the system at an incredible rate. The incoming warships appeared quicker than they could be shot down, but their approaches seemed haphazard. That probably helped them out however, because any time that they clustered the defense platform would exploit that to maximize destruction at every opportunity. 

The thought of how quickly we would have been shot out of the sky if the thing had deliberately tried to destroy our ship was chilling. I wondered why it hadn‚Äôt, and instead forced us down. I couldn‚Äôt stay in my thoughts however, given our front row seats to the current situation. 

It wasn‚Äôt completely clear who would win at the pace the fight was going, but unless the attackers had an ace up their sleeve things weren‚Äôt looking good for them currently. It was clear they were using some of the most advanced weapons that anyone in the galaxy had ever designed, but there wasn‚Äôt much they could do when their target was blowing up most ships before they could do anything meaningful.  

The radio traffic wasn‚Äôt quite as discordant as the hyperspace jumps seemed to be. If anything it was quite coordinated despite the massive number of casualties. Or as coordinated as so many different species could be. They were keenly reporting damage, but not detailing their own ships, but their target. 

‚ÄúWhat if the first waves were more to test the waters? And they‚Äôre preparing something else?‚Äù I asked. 

Villi Kersch took a couple large gulps from her bottle in response to my question. 

They were probing it for weakness, noting how long it took to acquire targets around itself, power fluctuations, anything they could decern as they poked at its neigh indestructible shell. They were chipping away at it slowly, but their adversary was essentially blasting their attacks away with its own. 

The attacking force needed a lot more firepower to win, but they seemed sure they would have it. 

 ‚ÄúThis one would place larger ship entries on the far side of the planet for maneuverability options. I will keep an antennae out for any scattered exit signatures.‚Äù Meadow Muffin said. 

‚ÄúIs it possible to change our orbit without drawing attention? Maybe something that will let us make a quicker escape without getting noticed?‚Äù I asked. Being able to peacefully deactivate the satellite was clearly off the table but getting away unscathed wasn‚Äôt. 

Villi Kersch ran her hand over her face before starting to slowly maneuver the ship. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope we aren‚Äôt considered a target by anyone here.‚Äù 

We slowly moved away from the planet, in a trajectory I thought could have been caused by space debris from the battle if I didn‚Äôt know Villi was slowly moving the ship. I kept an eye on the fighting however, making sure none of the combatants looked out of place. The chaos of the fighting was great cover however. 

Great enough cover that I didn‚Äôt notice the comms blinking right away. 

Something or someone was hailing us via hyperspace communications. I started silently checking the message, not wanting to interrupt the other two. 

It was encrypted but I recognized it and scrambled to connect my data pad to the comms console. What was a data format like this doing out here? 

--- 

Giada tried not to look too smug, but she was smiling wide. 

‚ÄúSee? We got the message to Ruri and that thing is too busy fighting with these aliens to have intercepted it.  ‚Äù 

‚ÄúCleverly sending Ruri a message or not, that satellite is still the most dangerous thing in this galaxy.‚Äù the Transmuter said. 

It was the closest thing to a compliment Giada had heard since they jumped into this system  in a rush to beat the massing Verminaut forces. There was already a firefight in progress, but they were still out of range to see it, rather picking up on it from stray hyperspace communications between the combatants. While hyperspace communications weren‚Äôt instant either, at this range they might as well be compared to lightspeed. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting another message back now. They‚Äôre still in orbit around the planet but were already adjusting course to avoid anyone seeing them. They want to know how much they should risk detection to get away from there.‚Äù Jett said, as he made sure their improvised changes held up. 

It was a little strange how the Spagyric Golem was being kept away from the comms they had set up. When Giada had proposed setting up a message that would avoid the satellite the Transmuter had been worried about she was sure he was going to task the Golem with setting it up. It would have been faster, but Giada and Jett had made short work of the modifications. 

‚ÄúIs my child okay?‚Äù Vouloir asked impatiently as he clung tightly to Sela Zuria. Jett was already typing something back, asking for everyone‚Äôs status. 

Giada thought about everything the Transmuter had discussed with them as they were drawing closer, at least before they had jumped into the star system in a hurry when they realized that the Verminaut ships they had been sneaking by had suddenly picked up their pace. How quickly a hyperspace gate network could move a fleet compared to normal hyperspace transit was a bit terrifying. It was even more terrifying how quickly the Verminauts could speed things up when they had any urgency. The most terrifying thing however was the string of curses the Transmuter had muttered as they went in. 

Jett started reading off the reply he got a minute later. ‚ÄúTheir entire crew is fine. Apparently they also have a native from the planet they took in order to try to deactivate the satellite, but that plan was more or less ruined by all the fighting. Ruri included a list of the hyperspace signatures they‚Äôve detected so far.‚Äù 

Vouloir looked relieved, as did Sela until the Listener‚Äôs tail wrapped around her thigh. Giada pulled the clingy Listener off of Sela and uncomfortably patted him on the back.  

Leaning over Jett‚Äôs shoulder and reading the correspondence himself, the Transmuter sighed. ‚ÄúLooks like more ships are still pouring into the grinder. I didn‚Äôt think the galactic powers would rally a fleet large enough this fast.‚Äù 

Giada didn‚Äôt think the Verminauts that were more or less on their tail did either. It was going to be messy to rendezvous with Ruri‚Äôs ship and get out of there. 

‚ÄúYou think they will destroy the satellite?‚Äù Giada asked. 

The Transmuter frowned. ‚ÄúWe need to be out of here before we find out. It would be a simple matter if Ruri and the others weren‚Äôt next to the planet but performing a hyperspace jump that close to the firefight is not a good idea either. Have them continue their course.‚Äù

Jett typed the reply, before getting another message then another. ‚ÄúLooks like Ruri patched in Mica and Odette to the conversation.‚Äù He turned to the Transmuter, while gesturing at Sela and Vouloir, ‚ÄúWould it be okay if I patched in their data pads?‚Äù 

After a few minutes Jett had set it up for Vouloir while Giada set up Sela‚Äôs data pad. 

‚ÄúDue to the nature of the connection its all just one giant chatroom, so sorry about the lack of privacy.‚Äù Giada said before she handed the data pad back to Sela. She was pretty sure her explanation was falling on deaf ears, but it must have been totally ignored on the other side given the incredibly raunchy message that Odette immediately typed out. 

‚ÄúIt is nice to hear that child still carries the tune of my people.‚Äù Vouloir hummed happily. 

Giada waited patiently while watching Jett read through the message on the terminal they had set up before he looked at her with tired eyes. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù 

‚ÄúPay up.‚Äù Giada demanded. 

Jett got up with a deep breath and forcefully placed his wager in Giada‚Äôs hands before heading for the door. ‚ÄúTake over, I‚Äôm going to get some coffee.‚Äù 

Ignoring Jett‚Äôs displeasure with his bet, Giada sat down, and immediately started typing her own greetings to Ruri, ignoring Mica‚Äôs apologies for the outburst from Odette. 

‚ÄúHey, is there anything else we can do from here?‚Äù she asked after hitting send. 

‚ÄúHave Ruri keep an eye on the fight as they get out of there. We need to know if the situation changes. The last thing we need is for that satellite to use its real weapon.‚Äù 

Giada started relaying the warning, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by real weapon?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt would be too dangerous to assume our line of communication is secure, I‚Äôll explain when everyone is back together.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnother secret for when you spill the beans to your daughter.‚Äù Sela pointed out. The Transmuter had a grim look on his face, but he didn‚Äôt say anything to that. 

Vouloir didn‚Äôt seem to catch any of the negative air at all from this, ‚ÄúUnderstandable, I want to make sure my precious Odette can hear the news of Ottilie‚Äôs pregnancy with all four ears.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll just make sure they know they should be careful in a hurry.‚Äù Giada said as she finished typing out her message. 

Skimming through the back and forth between Mica, Odette, and their parents, Ruri‚Äôs messages were more about the current situation, as she had been asked. The combat was finally slowing down, as hyperspace jumps to reinforce the attacking ships seemed to slow down to a crawl. Except Ruri didn‚Äôt seem to think the fight was done. 

And judging by the Transmuter‚Äôs pacing, he didn‚Äôt either. 

Ruri helped Giada set up a link so she could monitor the hyperspace signatures without it interrupting the conversations between everyone else. By the time they had set it up Jett was coming back with a carafe and a bunch of cups. 

‚ÄúAnything new happen?‚Äù Jett asked as he poured Giada a cup. 

Giada took a sip before ceding her seat back to Jett. ‚ÄúLull in the action, so we set up some remote telemetry here. Not sure if it will help at all but at least we won‚Äôt be blind to how much of a mess this whole situation is.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo much for all the diplomatic work.‚Äù Jett said as sat down and stared at the screen. ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll get lucky and they‚Äôre calling off the‚Äî""

Jett suddenly stopped talking as the screen started to light up with new information. It was like the finale of a fireworks show. The trickle of ships reinforcing the attackers had turned into an all-out blitz. 

‚ÄúLooks like our timetable just went from having time to slip away quietly to a set of fan blades turning on inside a toilet. Tell Ruri that they need to start spooling up their hyperspace drive now for an in-system jump. They should be able to jump here before it registers on any of the sensors of the ships that are fighting.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat will leave the ship dead in the water for another jump, what if someone tries to follow?‚Äù 

‚ÄúJust tell them. I‚Äôll have the Spagyric Golem prepare to assist in the evacuation of their ship. We can accommodate them here. They should be prepared to clear the logs and manifest. The captain of that ship has done smuggling operations before, they will know what to do. Inform them they will be compensated by myself and Vouloir for the total loss of the ship, even if they recover it later.‚Äù 

The Transmuter‚Äôs orders had a veneer of calm but there was an urgency that did not help Giada or Jett feel calm at all. 

‚ÄúAnd tell Ruri I‚Äôll explain everything when we‚Äôre all together.‚Äù 

The incoming feed of recognized hyperspace activity wasn‚Äôt slowing down either, but among the mass there were dozens upon dozens of hyperspace signatures recognized within five minutes of each other, all from unknown ships. And one of them was so large that Jett wondered if it was a sensor error. 

‚ÄúUnidentified ships. Should we inform Ruri?‚Äù Giada asked in a bit of a panic. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let the pattern scrambling fool you. Few forces in this galaxy can muster such a coordinated jump timing, let alone with a stream of loosely allied ships streaming in at the same time. Those are all Grabbun ships. The big one should be their flagship.‚Äù 

---

The Giga Extro Karkin had just returned to real space, and onboard the bridge was the Admiral of the Grabbun forces, with a grim look written on his carapace. 

Admiral Paralith was too old, and too sober for the cyclone of claws that was unfolding before him. 

The Calaxians had started the assault earlier than planned, which had turned the entire battle plan into turmoil. Calaxian forces had taken more casualties than expected as a result, and while that was their own damned fault, it did not reflect well on the Grabbun strategic command, which in turn did not reflect well on their forces. 

Having to use and reveal the full capabilities of the flagship was not the first choice of Admiral Paralith. But the political realities of the situation demanded by the galactic community and Grabbun central command were clear. The weapons platform defending the planet they had appeared above had to be destroyed. 

One of the bridge officers raised a claw before relaying important news, ‚ÄúCalaxians are reporting the Verminauts are massing much faster than we expected.‚Äù 

Another stupid complication. And made worse by how secretive the Calaxians had been. It might even have been why they rushed in like idiots before everyone else. If they had just alerted the alliance things could have gone far more smoothly, and they would have controlled the situation with a clenched claw. 

The Calaxians had managed to locate the massing point the Verminauts were using. Apparently they weren‚Äôt taking the declaration at the Galactic Moot censuring them lying down, and had an entire fleet mounted. Admiral Paralith suspected they had an observation satellite in the system as well, but to have slipped it under the beaks of the Calaxians meant they were likely hiding more capabilities once again. 

The threat the Verminauts posed was not to be taken lightly, but the situation still favored the side the Grabbun had taken. If their forces could take control of the system, and in effect the planet the Verminauts were coveting, they could effectively end hostilities before anything could start. They could even demand fair passage of their gate network to move ships. 

‚ÄúMake sure the VIP doesn‚Äôt leave the planet, and if they do take them into custody. The last thing we need is to let the Verminauts get a single leg up on us. Keep me posted if their forces decide to jump in.‚Äù 

If they could keep the former Dirtmen Ambassador out of the clutches of the Calaxians as well as the Verminauts it would be advantageous as well, but the Admiral kept this thought to himself. Mulling the situation over further, the Admiral‚Äôs eyes scanned the main view screen. 

‚ÄúIn the meantime, we should be proceeding with our planned assault. What is the status of the primary target?‚Äù 

He knew the answer, since the information fed to them by the fleet via hyperspace communications was displayed on the screen for him, but his officers were there to advise, not just follow orders blindly. The more claws they had clicking on the battle the better. 

‚ÄúStarting to falter, but still holding up longer than expected. It appears to be charging up for something. We‚Äôre keeping the defensive line while our weapons prime for the first salvo.‚Äù

Admiral Paralith clenched a claw. Everything was supposed to be ready to fire as soon as they entered the fray, but the Calaxians jumping the gun had messed up every part of the plan. Even their exit patterns were 20% looser than what they were capable of. He couldn‚Äôt blame them entirely for the sloppiness but every dead Grabbun in this fight was made less honorable by their actions. 

The defensive line would prevent any outsized risk for the Giga Extro Karkin but every shot by the target had been a ball of destruction. Its weapons far outclassed anything they had fired at is so far, even if it was starting to slow down. 

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs aim to destroy the target before it finishes whatever last gambit it has up its sleeve.‚Äù 

Of course, the weapons that had been fired at their target didn‚Äôt include those of the Giga Extro Karkin. They were going to turn it into slag, and gain control over the planet‚Äôs orbit. The Admiral just hoped the Verminauts wouldn‚Äôt try to get in the way of the after party. 

‚ÄúWeapon systems are almost ready for a full barrage.‚Äù 

Or maybe they could. After everything that had gone wrong today Admiral Paralith would be okay with putting them in their place in a less roundabout way. He could respect their logistics, but tactically they were boorish. The only time the Admiral had ever heard any evidence to the contrary was during the Helix-Verminaut War. Verminaut tactics mostly consisted of sending larger ships after smaller ones. If the Grabbun had tried to do that here they would have undoubtedly lost their flagship before it could fire. 

‚ÄúBattle group reports ready. The firing solution has been accepted. Commencing bombardment now.‚Äù 

Admiral Paralith watched panel after panel of weapon system go from ready to firing on the flagship as well as their battlegroup, as well as the other ships in the Grabbun fleet, and a few allies that were actually bothering to coordinate. 

As the attack reached the target, the visuals they were receiving from ships closest to it became more and more chaotic. The target went from receiving continuous fire from the allied strike force to being completely engulfed in the assault in a ball of explosions and flak. 

The assault continued for quite some time in an attack that would overwhelm even the best ship‚Äôs defenses. It was so complete that it made it hard for their sensors to even pick up what their attacks were doing. 

Coordinated fire was not easy to pull off from so many different places in space, but since most of it came from the flagship, it was much easier. Of course, these weapons were made to fight much bigger targets than the one they had today, such as Verminaut capital ships. The relative peace in the galaxy precluded such fights from happening, but the Grabbun certainly were fond of being prepared. 

As their bombardment ended, they waited for the glowing mass of metal to cool down so they could determine the damage. In the meantime weapons arrays and batteries were reloaded and recharged in preparation for another assault. 

Speaking up, one of the officers gave a situation report, ‚ÄúFleet sensors having difficulty as expected, but we still are detecting some sort of power fluctuation from the target. Weapons fire from the target has stopped however.‚Äù 

Admiral Paralith had to keep himself from clicking his claws. If they could capture the target without destroying it, and the planet, and the former Dirtmen ambassador, that would almost make up for the Calaxians going in gun blazing and nearly ruining the battle plans. 

Of course, they would have to play it safe and be prepared to fire again if the target was still dangerous. It might be possible it was charging a self-destruct mechanism for example. Directing the fleet, Admiral Paralith instructed forces to ‚ÄúPull back, but continue readiness preparations for the next firing solution.‚Äù 

Looking at the situation, Admiral Paralith also decided they should be ready for their other objectives. Hopefully the mess the Calaxians had made hadn‚Äôt jeopardized the rest of the alliance. The Grabbun weren‚Äôt exactly known to be diplomats but that didn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt value their allies. 

‚ÄúDid enough of the Zaklug and Helix forces survive this mess to start observation on the planet?‚Äù 

They might not be known for spying like the Calaxians were but that didn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt have an important part to play. The last thing Admiral Paralith wanted was the Calaxians claiming the victory after they had spoiled the entire situation so badly. 

One of his officers reported the situation, ‚ÄúBattered but not broken. Zaklugs are still engaged with the target but are holding fire for our next barrage. Helix forces seem to be more focused on pulling back right now. They‚Äôre both waiting on an all-clear right now for the next stage.‚Äù

They weren‚Äôt perfect allies, but they certainly were more dependable than the Calaxians had been. Even other species that had contributed less forces, or even insisted on only being logistical support had been more dependable. The only saving grace the Calaxians offered now aside from the size of their forces was their refusal to retreat no matter how badly the situation seemed to have gone early. 

One of the communications officers spoke up, ‚ÄúCalaxians are reporting the Verminaut fleet is spooling drives at their staging point. Apparently they decided to join the fray.‚Äù 

Admiral Paralith though about the utter mess the day was. Well, at least the Calaxians were paying their way now. Their spy stations might even have just saved more lives than they had cost. 

Before he could suggest a course of action, another officer spoke up as well. 

‚ÄúPower surge detected from the target. However it hasn‚Äôt fired any weapons we can detect.‚Äù 

Thinking for a moment, the Admiral sighed. ‚ÄúToo much of a risk that it might be trying to self-destruct, and we need to secure the planet before the Verminauts arrive. Fire another barrage as soon as the fleet is ready, and tell them to be ready to greet the bugs with another if they try anything. Have our allies move to secure the planet now.‚Äù 

Securing the planet was not a glamorous role since they were basically going to be holding it hostage against the Verminauts. Their fleet could probably still stand claw to claw with the bugs and teach them a lesson, but avoiding further conflict was equally important. 

His claws itching for something harder than brine, Paralith waited as their weapons charged and he considered what sort of ultimatum he needed to hail the Verminauts with. Maybe he‚Äôd have the Calaxians offer terms instead. 

An officer alerted that ‚ÄúWeapons ready for the next salvo.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFire.‚Äù Admiral Paralith confirmed with disinterest.  

As their primary target finally exploded into melted metal, the Grabbun fleet commander waited for the Verminauts to come in for the next stage of the conflict, not knowing what else they had invited into the galaxy.

Mine demands to do all the cooking and cleaning. One time, she gave me a haircut, started to vacuum the hair on the floor, then just vacuumed the whole place, even though I just did it the day before 

She tells me what time to shower, dry my hair, what time we're leaving the house, what time she'll start cooking supper so we can be at the movies for a certain time. She asks where we want to eat for supper, then says we're going to where she wants to anyway 

She cannot relax for 5 minutes, and is constantly trying to cater to everyone (do you need coffee, tea, your glasses?) and just constantly wipes down my clean countertops.  

When I was a kid, she would complain about no one helping her around the house, and then when we try to help, she would get upset because it was not being done her way

I've tried to explain that I want her to relax when she is at my house, and let me take care of things for her, but she just cannot stop and bursts into tears. She even gets upset when I furnish my home the way I want, and not in her style. I realize she has control and other issues, but boy it is exhausting trying to cater to them. I've tried having conversations with her for 15 years, but it just upsets her and nothing ever changes. She doesn't know anything other than ""Mom Mode"" even though her kids have lived away from her for 15-20 years. She hasn't been able to find an identity or happiness outside of Mom

1hoy8nq,https://i.redd.it/12sjiif23t9e1.png,OEM HINGE REPAIR (GP/GEX6 SERIES),"Hello guys ! I don't know if a tutorial like this has been ever done before on this subreddit but here we go !

After two years of trusty services, my laptop broke it's hinge and became a glorified paper weight that was waiting for some love.

The first repair i wanted to do was the JBWeld method but since the screen itself is also susceptible to failure, i figured it's best to avoid if you want to change the screen down the road since it will make a big mess that will be hard to clean.

So i did a little investigation and the part that is breaking on our laptops is not the hinge BUT what is screwed into the hinge, ladies and gentlemen ? The little plastic part that is hiding the hinge on the screen cover, it has three little posts for screws to go in, securing the screen to the hinge. (Shown on the image of this post)

It is just plain stupid and doomed to fail.

/!\ i'm required to say this but do this at your own risk, i am not responsible for any of your actions. /!\

Parts required : 
- MSI GP/GEX6 HINGE COVER
- LOCTITE SUPER3 GLUE
- SMALL SCREWDRIVER
- PLIERS
- SANDPAPER

SO HERE'S THE FIX (f*** you MSI) :

1) Secure the laptop by putting it on its side, so you have the broken side up.

2) Remove the adhesive window that goes around the screen that hides the hinges ect...

3) You will have a lot of little plastic parts flying everywhere, be sure to remove them all to avoid problems down the road.

4) Now let's investigate the hinge itself, you will have the three posts still screwed on the hinge, use some thin pliers to hold the post as you unscrew it otherwise it will turn with the screw. (Keep the screws, you might need them.)

5) You will notice another plastic part holding on to the hinge, fixed in place with two screws, DON'T REMOVE THIS ONE.
ON 99% OF THE CASES IT WON'T,  BUT IF IT'S DESTROYED TO HELL AND BEYOND, SKIP PART 11

6) Now we'll need to remove the plastic part (Once again, the one on the image linked to this post) from the screen, the only thing holding it are little X shaped posts that are melted down the screen cover to make them act as rivets, so sadly when breaking this part off, you'll have very thin plastic stuck behind the screen. Use some leverage with a plastic tool to lift it and break the rivets.
After further testing you can't hear them and it will not damage the screen, so you're good to go !

7) Clean everything with alcohol to make yourself ready for the repair. Drink a coffee maybe. 

8) Order the new plastic cover ! I bought mine on AliExpress and it will come with both sides + screws, your mileage may vary depending the buyer you get the cover from though.

9) Take your new and shiny plastic hinge cover, and sand down every posts to make them shorter.
We're doing this because we can't rivet them down such as how they're doing it at the factory.
(You can but you have to take the whole screen assembly off to do that, that's up to you !)

10) /!\ TRY TO KEEP THE HINGE AND THE SCREEN ASSEMBLY ALIGNED FOR THIS STEP /!\
Once sanded, try to fit the cover on the screen just to get the feel of it, once that done ? Burst out your LOCTITE SUPER3 GLUE and add a little dab to each and every post, then you just have to put back your cover where it belongs, making sure to align every hole. Then wait 10 minutes for the glue to set before doing anything else to the laptop
(You will have to try to move the screen at different angles to make the part fit correctly, it's a little fiddly but with some practice you'll manage for sure !)

11) Now, remember the plastic part you left on your hinge ? Use your LOCTITE to glue it back. This part is from the screen assembly itself, not the cover. Wait for 10 minutes before doing anything else to the laptop, use calmps if you have them to keep pressure on the glued part.

12) You're almost done ! You just have to screw the 3 little posts to the hinge making sure everything is aligned, test your work and voil√† ! Clip and if it won't stick no more, just glue back the window that goes around the screen but not with LOCTITE, if you're lucky it should've stayed adhesive enough to just go back on itself.

And done ! This is how you fix your screen in the most OEM way possible ! 
Yes i know, it's still plastic so it will fail again, but at the same time you're keeping everything original, from the mounting system to the lack of custom screws & bolt, JBWELD and all of that stuff.

Mine works perfectly now, opens & closes just like it supposed to !
It was fairly easy to do and quick also, so here's that ! If you have questions or need help, feel free to let me know. <3",1,1735486055.0,MSILaptops,0,1.0,False
1hoy8mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonAgeVeilguard/comments/1hoy8mr/such_a_missed_opportunity_for_spite_in_lucanis/,Such a missed opportunity for Spite in Lucanis‚Äô romance!,"I‚Äôve been writing some fanfic about what happens after the events of DAV and it‚Äôs really highlighted what a missed opportunity we had with the character of Spite. 

Spirits and those they inhabit have long been a part of DA lore, both as quests and companions. Anders immediately springs to mind, as does Cole from DAI (who I just recruited yesterday on a new playthru; I‚Äôd totally forgotten about his character, which is hilarious/apropos if you consider his storyline). So spirits aren‚Äôt new and could easily be another dimension to Lucanis‚Äô arc, ESPECIALLY his romance. 

Where Lucanis himself is sweet but keeps himself tightly controlled, Spite is all Id and reactivity. You can almost put him in the same boat (that of pet) akin to Manfred and Assan, but Spite has some really insightful observations once he settles in with Lucanis that IMO make him deserve a second look for character development. 

For the romance though: wow. What a fantastic but WASTED opportunity. Here you have a demi-sexual Lucanis who is sweet and loves his coffee (and his Rook), living alongside the much more passionate Spite. Romance players of DA games were predictably going to go FERAL for Spite, but we don‚Äôt get any direct interactions with him and Rook. Even though WE can see how much Spite wants Rook, our character rarely gets to interact directly with the demon except when Lucanis is holding tightly to the reins. 

We could‚Äôve had a two-in-one romance deal with the assassin and his sexy demon, but instead he‚Äôs relegated to side character. Such a waste. 

I also looked up antonyms to Spite in Google this morning, and you know what one of them is? Affection. Can you freaking IMAGINE if we‚Äôd gotten a story of how Spite ‚Äúbecame‚Äù a demon after being a corrupted version of a spirit of Love? What an entirely new dimension to the character and how that particular romance could‚Äôve played out!!

Just‚Ä¶canonically, it feels like such a waste. Yes yes, I know this is what fanfic is for and believe me I‚Äôm working on my own headcanon stuff. I also know this is a common complaint (lack of romance content in DAV), but dangit lol I wish we‚Äôd get some more romancy DLC to augment what little we got in the game!!!",10,1735486052.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,7,0.81,False

1hoy7f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hoy7f0/different_sleeping_habits/,Different sleeping habits,"Sandrine and Jean have been in a relationship for over 3 years and they have different sleeping habits. Sandrine needs ar least 8-9 hours of sleep and cannot sleep again after being woken up by an  alarm. Now Jean on the other hand takes several minutes before even opening his eyes after the alarm rings while Sandrine has to push Jean so that he wakes up and turn off the alarm. And very often Jean puts unrealistic alarms in the evening ( ex: go to sleep at 1-2am and puts alarm at 8am) and when the alarms is set off Sandrine wakes up and has to push Jean to turn it off and then Jean goes back to sleep which make Sadrine mad as she cannot get back to sleep and for nothing as Jean didn't get up. Now here is what Sandrine put in place: everytime Jean puts an alarm and doesn't wake up (meaning getting out of bed and not coming back) he has to pay a piece if cake or a coffee in a cafe for Sandrine. So far, the number of 'coffees' owed is three and one paid for. However, the number of times this situation has occured has disminished since the establishment of this rule. Things to note: we are both student and broke so a piece of cake/ coffee is a ""luxury"" but on the other hand Sandrine feels like because it is costing Jean money thats why this situation does not happen as often as before. This rule also insures that Sandrine is not mad for the whole day(or more) against Jean for not respecting her sleep. Sandrine thinks only money will make him change and has no other solutions proposed. The way Jean sees it is different. He understands the problem but feels it is somewhat unfair. He often has troubles falling asleep but still aims to wake up early to get himself out of the bad sleeping cycle he has. However, since he is a heavy sleeper in the morning, he doesn't always manage to wake up and is scared that with this rule, he doesn't have a good solution to getting his rhythm back in order when it is out of check. Also he has been in debt (to his dad) and is building up a buffer to avoid it happening again, so coffees are items he doesn't usually pay for himself.

Who is the asshole? Whats the solution?

But I don‚Äôt do anything about it because I don‚Äôt know how. Can you help me out?,"I‚Äôm kind of kicking myself over a situation that happened last night haha hence the post.

At 27 years old, I only just start going out to bars. Never liked them but I grew tired of being home all day playing video games and watching films. So I‚Äôve made an effort to do more stuff outside such as the gym, library, coffee shops and yes of course going out on weekends to bars and clubs. Have only done so these last few months. Point I‚Äôm getting as is, it‚Äôs still a new environment to me even if I have grown to like them and some have become comfort zone.

But I never in my life have hooked up or began dating a woman I‚Äôve met in person. My whole dating life has been OLD. On top of that, I‚Äôve never been a particularly attractive person. At least not enough to get attention. Even now I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a looker. 

But the gym, on top of some cosmetic changes, has put in a better league than I was a year ago. 

 It‚Äôs happened to me a few times where I find myself talking to a woman at the club, whether an old class mate I knew, or a OLD match who approached me when she recognized me, or an older drunk lady clearly trying to get it on, but I end up cutting the conversation short cause I panic and don‚Äôt know what to say. 

I don‚Äôt have this issue much in calmer places. Several weeks ago I talked it up with a girl at the coffee shop and was able to hold a convo just fine. Thing is, that‚Äôs a chill place where talking about your career, hobbies, daily life activities, general convo is accepted.

At the club though people are hyped and getting tipsy/drunk. There‚Äôs a fun vibe one needs to possess. A vibe Im not used to having. Again, I‚Äôm more introvert by nature and even my demeanor it‚Äôs naturally being laid back‚Ä¶. Unless a good song is put at the club haha. 

Last night I‚Äôm kicking myself causes I was staring into space at the club, and it happens I was looking at this beautiful girl. She turns to me and I realize we‚Äôre eye fucking each other. But like bad. Borderline becoming a starting contest. We stared at each other for at least a good solid 10 seconds. I never shy away from eye contact but this time she truly was looking into soul and starting feeling anxious. And the rest of the night I caught her looking at me. When she went up to do some karaoke, she came back down, walked passed me and I high fived her and she really held on as long as she could haha.

But again, didn‚Äôt do anything. What I‚Äôm asking is, how do I built ‚Äúclub speak‚Äù skills ? What does it entail? What do you usually say? How does a hook up process usually go down? 

Sadly I‚Äôm one of those people that needs instructions on how to‚Ä¶ well do anything really haha: ",2,1735485850.0,self,0,1.0,False

Yesterday I confronted her on a few things that happened this week. 1) She made plans Xmas evening to go to dinner w a friend and I was not invited 2) when I commented that our coffee maker (a wedding gift)has lasted longer than any I‚Äôve ever had, she said, ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs lasted longer than the happy portion of our marriage.‚Äù 3) she posted an IG story of her 2024 that had lots of pics of her with other people but none of me. 
She had lots of excuses that didn‚Äôt hold water, but no self reflection or real apology. I think she can‚Äôt separate admitting doing something wrong occasionally from having that admission mean that she‚Äôs a bad person. The most she could say was I‚Äôm sorry you felt that way. What I would hope for is that after some self reflection saying something like I was wrong and I understand how those things hurt your feelings. I will work to not do those types of things moving forward. 
The talk was fairly exhausting and I often feel like I pound my head against the wall trying to get her there but she never does get it‚Ä¶.so I‚Äôve started to end conversations quicker bc all it gets me is incredibly frustrated. 
I suppose incidents like these and 100 more before them for the last couple years have me exhausted and wondering if it‚Äôs time to exit. Weird thing is I think she senses it and has been somewhat nicer recently‚Ä¶waking up to have breakfast together, asking if I want to join her doing something, etc.

The initial situation

* We are sharing a streaming service with a friend, let‚Äôs call him George, who is paying for it in full
* George texts me, saying that he only has the subscription until date X
* I inform my wife about this
* We agree that it‚Äôs not ideal as our kids like to use it too
* She proposes reaching out to another friend, to see if they want to share an account
* I agree
* The conversation moves on to something else

A couple of minutes later

* She asks if George is not continuing to pay for the streaming service
* I am surprised by the question, as we‚Äôve just had a conversation about it, and I assumed she understood what we had been talking about - as she had even proposed a solution
* However, I tell her, no, he will not be continuing to pay for the service

A further couple of minutes later

* She asks the same question again
* I asked her if she didn‚Äôt listen to my previous answer
* I am now super annoyed and we fight

Context

* This has happened before (multiple times): she asks me a question, doesn‚Äôt listen to the answer, goes on with her business (I then assume she has listened to the answer) then asks it again (the questions/answer loop sometimes even repeats more often)
   * My view: I don‚Äôt feel like she‚Äôs listening, gets distracted and it annoys me - I don't feel valued/not heard and the fact that this behaviour repeats makes it all the more difficult for me not to get annoyed. A one-off would be fine, but the fact that it repeats annoys me a lot - which continuously leads to fights
* My wife was making coffee (grinding beans etc) at the time she asked the question the first time
   * My view: if she didn‚Äôt hear the answer the first time, why did she not ask me to repeat it there and then OR phrase the second time saying ‚ÄòSorry, I didn‚Äôt hear you the first time because everything around me was so loud‚Äô?
* My wife says this is because of tiredness - we have two kids (nearly 2 and 4), and no family support nearby
   * My view: I acknowledge that she's tired. I am also tired, we still share the same bed, I am a super light sleeper, and I am always awakened between 01:00 and 05:00 by our oldest kid and asked to come sleep next to him in his room. I am tired too - however, I still listen, when she answers my questions.
* ADHD - my wife has recently been diagnosed with ADHD but not has taken any medication, due to her still breastfeeding our youngest
   * My view: this is the reason for this repeating problem - she gets distracted easily, not just when asking questions, but also when doing chores etc. I have asked her to set reminders/write a todo list to get stuff done, but she doesn‚Äôt
* I am frustrated

I'm a male, 27, half Asian, very average lad.

I've always felt like I was ugly growing up, and kids at school made sure I knew that. I've been working in my love life since early, so I've not been too lonely in my teenage years, but I've always thought it was because I was nice to people and made them feel comfortable (which it also is, to be fair, very important).

Very recently, I've found myself commenting on some Instagram Reels, but very superficial things. Surprisingly, a comment reached 1.5 likes and I've had some people complimenting my looks. Some have started following me and are liking my photos. That part is a bit weird, but I figure they meant no harm, but I might make my profile private after this.

These last few years, as I reach deeper into adulthood, I feel like my friends are also maturing, and we can talk about things in a more mature and direct way. Some of my friends confessed having a crush on me for the longest time. One of these times it was in a group and it was hilarious, I had never been truly speechless in my life before.

That's it, I appreciate every single compliment that I got, it made me feel like I'm at least not bad looking, especially when it comes from people that I find so beautiful. I don't know if that counts, because I find most people good looking, and not meaning to be cheesy, but if you're reading this, I bet you're very good looking to my eyes too. 

I'm honestly just celebrating this, I'll go and grab a coffee now.

And there was this other family, parents were sitting by themselves, letting 2 young boys fend for themselves. Nice approach in many circumstances. Teach the kids to be independent. One was making waffles, but forgot to apply the oil spray. He was using both the waffle irons, and waffles got stuck. And there was a long queue behind him. Was I feeling sorry for the kid. Maybe a little. But I was pissed with the parents, so I let that boy struggle with his waffles. His brother on the other hand made a mess dispensing cereal. He filled milk first and then cereal.

Harrison felt sick, his head spinning with nausea. His eyes refused to focus as his brain was barraged with visions of blue sparking anomalies, barren orange wastelands, kilometer-high concrete walls embedded into cave faces, and all sorts of disconnected images for minutes on end. He didn‚Äôt have the time to process any of them as he was suddenly jolted around.

The blur within his vision melted away with a snap, the dark world ahead of him coming into view. The encircling brain-fog barely allowed him to take in the deep orange industrial lights that sparsely illuminated the stainless steel cage he found himself in. Tall shadowy figures stood just in his peripherals, the tips of plasma casters poking out from their silhouettes, held at low ready. The screech of guide wheels burned into his ears all the while.

Everything seemed to come to him in packets of sights and sounds‚Äîa slideshow of sensations played like a movie. He barely felt his body; not the clothes on his back, the temperature of the air, or much else. There was only a gnawing pain in his knees and a soreness in his hands, like he‚Äôd been carrying something for far too long. He couldn‚Äôt even turn his head to take in wherever he was‚Äîa manufacturing elevator, if he had to guess. Maybe? Nothing was clear.

The flickers of his inconsistent vision flashed with an infinite amount of lights floating up from outside the skeletonized grate window opposite to him, implying he was descending rapidly. He almost got lost in how many there were, a faint memory of streetlights passing him by coming to mind, lulling him into its hypnotic rhythm.

Another jolt nearly took him off his feet, an immediate groan of heavy unseen mechanisms following. They clanked and whirred for several seconds before the elevator door split into two, opening fully. The world ahead was lit up with bright white lights, so much so he couldn‚Äôt make out much besides that fact. The tall figures beside him marched forward into the shining abyss. There were four of them in total, each wearing dark gray armor that covered their entire bodies, entire faces obscured by slabs of heat-resistant metals. Huh. What were they doing?

He followed them with short steps, not of his own volition. His eyes eventually adjusted, the obscuring illumination falling away as a distant cacophony reached his ears. An absolutely cavernous room stretched out across all he could see. An array of Massive concrete pillars segregated hundreds of‚Ä¶ *areas*, if he had to put a word to the sight. Radio-protectant domes, skeletonized skyscrapers filled with churning machines, massive metallic tanks within nests of pipes, and walled-off temporary research zones were spread out in their own respective sections amongst the wide floor. Some humans in hazmat suits scampered between the smaller zones while three-story-tall quadruped automatons dragged construction equipment through the alleyways formed between the precincts.

His group walked through the numerous ‚Äòbuilding‚Äô units, allowing him to get a better look into the goings-on. Some of the crates carried by the robots were labeled with ‚ÄòEco. Manufacturing - Research Div.‚Äô in addition to a handful of warning symbols that seemed oddly familiar. Exclamation marks? Bacteria? Electrified brains? ‚Ä¶Had he seen those before?

His eyes wandered away, locking onto whatever caught his attention. A window within one of the experimentation areas revealed a spinning galaxy held within a metallic hoop filled with wires. A first-floor machine pressed sheets of brown metal, the resulting plate allowed to float into a nearby storage area like it was under the influence of telekinesis. Neon-green liquid flowed through a reinforced pipe into a see-through vat where it was allowed to settle into a darker hue before being sucked away again. He could hardly focus on all the dazzling and unique things going on, his murky mind barely stringing the sights together.

Words injected themselves into his mind just as his group passed the final section, reminding him of how the Malkrin spoke. Some part of the ‚Äòspeech‚Äô felt familiar, the faintest femininity etching itself with each syllable.

*Its gifts shall carry you far.*

The armed guards took Harrison toward a hermetically sealed door in the far wall. It opened with a groan loud enough to hurt his ears, revealing a locker room behind its protection. White biosafety suits lined the storage closets, each bound to their own respiration system.

*But, you must tread lightly.*

He blinked and his vision was suddenly blurred by the scientific garb, hot breath clouding the clear plastic that separated him from the world. Heavy gloves encased his fingers, the restrictive material threatening to cut off circulation. 

*Learn from our mistakes.*

There were dozens of winding octagon-shaped hallways beyond the ‚Äòairlock.‚Äô Thin lines cut across every surface, hollow footsteps implying something resting just beneath the metallic floorboards. A bulkhead-like door led to a dimly-lit command room. Dozens of screens filled workstation walls that surrounded the door in a semi-circle, their blue light covering what the overhead lights didn‚Äôt. Various silhouettes worked in each area, all silent as they stared into the graphs and data in front of them. One section stood out from the rest, its monitors bathed in a red‚Ä¶ *fleshy* hue, monitoring a familiar nightmare.

*You have done much, but you must never grow complacent.*

He stepped forward, approaching a tall man standing at the center of the whole operation. The sturdy male wore a skin-tight hazmat suit colored in the orange Martian digital camo. The widely-built individual crossed his arms over his chest, the stern look on this square face matching his short, flat-top gray hair. Military? 

*We can not bear to see another failure.*

The engineer approached him, taking in a deep breath before handing over a canister, a foreign sense of guilt pressuring Harrison at the action. The cylinder was thick, reinforced slivers of some clear material showing a glowing blue orb held within. A subtle hum emanated from it, small sparks of electricity licking at the confines like an animal scratching at its cage.

*We watch you with bated breaths and steady hope.*

\- - - - -

Harrison felt consciousness return to him through the haze of uncertain images, the visions withering out of his mind by the second. He could hardly hold onto them when his bruised shoulder felt like jello and his morning headache pulsed through his skull. God, the day he ran out of instant coffee and painkillers was the day he gave up‚Ä¶ At least he was at home, given the comfort of the mattress beneath him.

He tried to stretch, but an encompassing pressure swallowed him whole, resisting his every movement. Only a small wet spot atop his head stood out as a unique sensation amongst the barriers that held him tight. He had to have been completely encased, with a cool surface on his back and a hot pillow in his arms‚Äîat least they were moderately squishy. It smelled like pollen-filled flowers, gunpowder, and‚Ä¶ the metallic scent of arc-welding. His sore eyes barely managed to open a crack.

Familiar black hair laid atop his splayed out arm while large maroon seat-belt limbs wrapped around him‚Ä¶ Tracy? Shar? He tried to move his head but was met with a very‚Ä¶ Well‚Ä¶ He didn‚Äôt even know how to describe the feeling. Was there a fish pressed into the top of his skull? His motions seemingly stirred the giant beast playing big-spoon with him. The paladin squeezed both him and the woman in his arms closer, nuzzling her snout into the top of his skull. She separated for a moment, a very wet and thick object dragging atop his head, her powerful tongue pushing into him. He couldn‚Äôt stop a shudder from creeping up his neck. Did she just lick him? He‚Ä¶ He didn‚Äôt know how to feel about that. It was sort of endearing but also just‚Ä¶ *what*? It was whatever, he guessed. More alien shark people stuff he had yet to get accustomed to.

Harrison let his eyes close once more. The force of nature that was comfort fought against every internal alarm clock that told him to get out of bed and get back to work. His headache begged for painkillers, his legs yearned to stretch, and his chest compressed under the shame of ignoring his responsibilities. Yet, he was effectively locked into place by two people he didn‚Äôt mind staying with. It was a guilty pleasure to let himself be complacent if anything, and he hardly had the will to fight against it.

Tracy‚Äôs torso rose and fell with every soft breath, her warm exhales trickling out onto his bicep she was using as a pillow‚Äîthe rest of his arm fizzling like static‚Äîleaving the softest of mewls with each one. Shar‚Äôs tail subtly constricted around his calves. Its squishy underbelly cushioned the length of his legs. Her subtly cool skin seemed to drink from his skin‚Äôs warmth, preventing him from overheating with the human space heater pressed up against his chest. The paladin‚Äôs upper arms had snaked their way around his stomach, her massive hands gently clenching and letting go of him every few moments as if checking he was still there. It was like an unintentional massage, the deep rumbling purrs that vibrated through her snout and chest already melding away his headache. Her entire body resonated into his own with every grumbling inhale. God, he did *not* want to leave. Not with his exhaustion, pain, and stress lying just outside the embrace.

Unfortunately for his psyche, he could feel the imminent paranoia encroach on him for his failure to check on the settlement. A thousand worries and possible threats danced around him like encircling demons, poking him with pitchforks and spears, egging him on with guilt. What if a production line was backed up? What if there were byproducts yet to be cleared? What if the workshop power ran out overnight? He just knew there would be a bitch and a half of problems to weed out as soon as he stepped out of the barracks. But‚Ä¶ what if there weren‚Äôt any? Just for the morning. Just for now.

Why? Why should he not be allowed to enjoy the moment this one time? Most of the settlers won‚Äôt wake up for another hour, so why couldn‚Äôt he? Just for this morning, he begged the fiends within his mind to let him be. To let him rest. He could feel their stares of culpability bore into him as he squeezed Tracy closer to him. He could hear their whispers of judgment as he separated his calves enough to allow Sharky to wrap her tail ever more around them. His wishes slowly came to life with every act of resistance, the manifestations of his own self-hatred withering away bit by bit. A simple promise to get twice the work amount of done afterward sealed the deal. He let his body melt further into his guardian‚Äôs embrace, his hold on the technician growing even tighter.

He liked having her close to him. He liked having both of them so close‚Ä¶ His free arm was slunk over the technician‚Äôs side. His palm pressed into where her tank top failed to cover her midriff, her heat radiating through him. There was nothing but pliable skin there, but the short stretch of open flesh suddenly felt like so much more in a sudden spark of growing interest. A simple touch could send bolts of lightning through his fingertips. It flicked switches in his brain he had left to gain dust after selling his life to pioneering‚Äîdesires he had suppressed in favor of his goals. They were things he could do without when there were monsters banging at the gate, but now in the darkness of a shared yet private bunk room, with his stressors removed‚Ä¶

Everything about her screamed at him with a primal, natural need, running through his veins like a hit of stimulants. She was more than attractive, and he had always knew that‚Äîespecially with all the aliens around making her the only shred of familiarity. All the contact they shared seemed to burn into him. Her waist pressed against his stomach, her silken hair on his skin, and her wide yet toned legs brushing alongside his own numbed him, replacing pain and stress with a sizzling excitement. His mind worked devoid of anything worth noting as ‚Äòintelligence,‚Äô falling apart the second it was allowed to drag up the pent-up instinctual drive to seek out another.

She gently resettled herself in her unconscious state, subtly pressing the back of her head into his shoulder with a tired sigh. It was a short motion, but it was enough to give him a third-person of himself. He snapped out of the enrapturing daze. She was *asleep*. A rotten disgust boiled in his stomach at whatever he had been subconsciously planning to do. He wasn‚Äôt actually going to do anything, but for God‚Äôs sake, what was he thinking? Just because she was literally in his arms didn‚Äôt give him the right to do anything beyond whatever platonic company they shared.

He saw her as a friend, er, well, something a bit closer than a vague, dull term as a ‚Äòfriend,‚Äô especially after that heart-to-heart the night prior. But, he couldn‚Äôt say for certain she felt anything more than he did, making his potential wandering touch all the more reprehensible. They weren‚Äôt like that yet. The sting of shame gave him enough time to settle his heartbeat and suppress whatever desires gnawed at his lizard brain.

He hesitantly withdrew his hand, returning it somewhere safe by resting it atop Shar‚Äôs bicep, instincts having him gently scratch at her skin the way she loved. A short, groan of disappointment left Tracy‚Äôs unconscious lips, her hips softly digging into him with lazy motions. No matter what he tried, he still couldn‚Äôt quite distance his thoughts from the woman nestled up into him. Why did he have to be sexual? Was he really that much of a slave to his desires? He didn‚Äôt even love her. Or, at least he didn‚Äôt think he did. They were reliant on each other as the only other living humans on the planet. He had a million things to appreciate her for between her humor, technical genius, and‚Ä¶ That was all beside the point.

Christ, why couldn‚Äôt he just be happy with having her comfortable enough to fall asleep next to him? Couldn‚Äôt he just appreciate the lack of loneliness for now and then return to the workshop after, instead of letting all these questions run rampant in his mind? He had one damn second to take his mind off of the nasty world around, and he suddenly found even more things to overthink and stress over. It‚Äôs like his body couldn‚Äôt handle living without it, forcibly creating things to run him back into the same pit he resided in most days.

Like metal strained beyond its material‚Äôs plasticity‚Ä¶ forever disfigured on the molecular level.

Huh.

Guess he resonated with bars of steel now.

He sighed, turning his head to face the ceiling. He was even more exhausted than he was a few minutes ago, but couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep‚Ä¶ At least his headache went away. All there was to do now was to try and enjoy whatever fuzzy feelings marinated in his chest. It was the only thing to feel once all the guilt, shame, appeal, and melancholy fell away.

Honestly? It was nice.

*‚ÄúW-What can you tell me about it?‚Äù* the gatherer queried, anxiously scraping the ends of his talons together.

Candlelight licked the perfectly-cut stone walls of the abyss beneath the mountain, leaving black shadows to crawl where the light dare not touch. The text-keeper stood at his stone studying block, layers of parchment strewn across half of it. The other side was bereft of anything beside a glowing, deep maroon rock that the gatherer had acquired. Waves of candent orange light ebbed and flowed along the surface of it, the very ground beneath it seeming to sizzle under its presence.

The elder male hobbled around the side of the makeshift table, leaning his cowl-covered head in toward it. He inched a talon close to it, poking it once before yanking his hand back, hissing. His nasally, gravel-like intent sputtered out, interest dripping from his tone. *‚ÄúMmmmmm. What-what can **you** tell me about th-this fascinating object? I may ha-have ideasss, but that dependsss on what you-you can tell me, mmmmm? Yes yes. That is right, it depends.‚Äù*

The yellow-skinned male took a hesitant step backward. He had never heard the voice of the text-keeper before beyond one-word replies. He‚Ä¶ He did not like it. It unnerved him. *‚ÄúI c-can only say it was taken from‚Ä¶ from one of the, uhm‚Ä¶ from one of the otherworldly fields‚Äîone with great geysers of fire.‚Äù*

The esoteric Malkrin nodded, holding a piece of parchment over the anomalous rock. An invisible aura a hands-length around it seemed to melt the writing material in a perfect circle. It was almost as if there were an unseen fire, waiting to burn away at anything within its embrace. *‚ÄúI s-see. Was it you who-who harvested it then? Hmmm?‚Äù How hasss it been brought back? It-it hasss quite‚Ä¶ mmmm‚Ä¶ **interesting** properties. Fa-Familiar, evennn.‚Äù*

The gatherer produced the heavy wooden backpack he used for harvesting roots and berries. The skeleton-like Malkrin reached out and tore it from his hands, causing the yellow-skinned male to flinch. *‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ It does not burn the blue flexible wood. Nor does it burn through the flesh. It only hurts.‚Äù*

The text-keeper brought the sturdy blue construction toward the fiery orange rock without hesitation. Nothing happened, as expected. The decrepit male‚Äôs body seemed to shake as he pushed the backpack off to the side with short, stuttering exhales. His breaths turned into unsettling clicks from the back of his throat as he reached forward and snatched the glowing object with his bare talons. His body seized, sucking air through his clenched teeth before letting out a low, unsettling chitter. Dust and stone and grime burned off of his emaciated forearm. Small specs of black ashes fell away from him. He kept bringing the otherworldly thing closer, his laugh growing louder and louder to the point of insanity. His wet lips dried, eyelashes singing as it crossed the line toward his eye.

The gatherer could only watch in horror as the psychotic male took in one last strained breath before slamming the object back onto the stone block. He doubled over, his deranged chitters echoed through the halls between desperate gasps for air and hacking coughs.

*‚ÄúSuccess! Success! Yes, we have it! We know! We know of its glory!‚Äù* the text-keeper shouted.

*‚ÄúWh-What?‚Äù* The yellow-skinned male took several steps backward.

The cloaked Malkrin‚Äôs blazing yellow eye bored into him from under his hood. *‚ÄúThe-the Textsss of Origin! This must be it! The artifactsss! The Progenitors‚Äô souls!Y-You ssssay they can be found with-within the otherworldly fieldsss?‚Äù*

The gather‚Äôs legs fought against him to leave, trembling ever-so-slightly. He *needed* to escape from the unstable male. But, he knew better. Only the Mountain Lord knew what Kegara would do to him for disobeying her orders. *‚ÄúTh-That is correct.‚Äù*

A short coughing fit echoed in the room as the text-keeper regained himself‚Äîhowever much was possible with his skeletal form‚Äîstraightening his back. *‚ÄúMmmmmm. You m-must bring me more. Thessse shall be-be invaluable for my-my studiessss‚Ä¶ a-and the colony. Here.‚Äù*

He shuffled over to his parchments, using a quill to scribble atop an empty paper canvas. *‚ÄúT-Take this. Give Keg-Kegara my reguardsss. It ssshall be seen that your pro‚Ä¶fessssion is changed to-to suit thisss, hmmm?‚Äù*

The yellow-skinned male took the note with a hesitant grip, nodding. *‚ÄúOf c-course‚Äù*

He turned around immediately, scampering off back through the black cave with naught but his torch and a tail tucked between his legs. Mountain Lord, what had he gotten himself into?

\= = = = =

Showing Malkrin anime was a *horrible* idea. Why did Tracy even agree to it? She thought it would be kind of cool or interesting, or at least *funny*, when Javelin and Oliver asked her about it‚Ä¶ Well, maybe it was a bit amusing to see their reactions.

The settlement had finished their nightly training and had their dinner. Tracy managed to slog through yet another round of melee practice, just barely keeping her cool with the help of Harrison‚Äôs advice and hands-on assistance with her footing. She ate with him by the fire, making small talk while checking her data pad for any new information from the recon drones roaming around the nearby ocean. The new arrivals *should* be here soon, but there was no telling if there would actually be any. It‚Äôs not like it was a guaranteed timer for new Malkrin to show up on the beaches.

Either way, the settlement went their separate ways after the evening meal‚Äîthe miners to sleep, the laborers to whatever hobbies they did, and the rest to train at the range or something else‚Ä¶ Tracy didn‚Äôt know what everyone was up to at every hour. Though, she did know there were at least eight practicing their aim outside the walls, since Harrison still wanted all the rules enforced. ‚ÄòNo less than eight individuals may leave the walls at once‚Äô was sort of reasonable, given the shit that was out there, but it sure as hell ruined any plans she had for going out with Rei and testing the rebuilt hunter. Tracy wasn‚Äôt exactly interested in going around and gathering more people to just practice with the mech, so it had to be postponed until later.

‚Ä¶And, of course, later would have to be tomorrow after she got wrapped into showing shark-people anime‚Ä¶ specifically, ‚Äòromantic-comedy‚Äô as Oliver requested for whatever reason. 

*‚ÄúWhat are those boxes she is carrying?‚Äù* Akula asked curiously, staring at Tracy out of the corner of her eye and pointing to the screen.

The technician sighed, already having answered one too many questions on top of translating whatever words weren‚Äôt turned to Malkrin script in the subtitles. ‚ÄúBento boxes. They‚Äôre for holding food.‚Äù

*‚ÄúSo, they are like heat-boxes?‚Äù*

‚ÄúJust watch,‚Äù she stated flatly.

The room was black, save for the massive television set up on the wall opposite to the recently-enlarged couch. The pink-haired girl on-screen raced up the school stairs, bursting through the roof access door into a bright day. Flower petals from the top-floor tree garden fluttered down around her. She looked around desperately for the love interest, jogging through the rose bushes and weeping willow trees. Then, she spotted him looking over the railing out toward the wide city, her heart fluttering. She would finally be able to win him over with her homemade cookies.

Yet, the female protagonist was stopped when a tall figure came out from nowhere. It was the president of the boxing club, wearing bandage wraps over her chest in lieu of any normal shirt or bra or anything‚Ä¶ wrapping her grubby arm over the boy‚Äôs shoulder like she owned him. The pink-haired girl stood still, dropping the bento boxes to the floor in shock‚Ä¶ and heartbreak.

‚Ä¶Tracy always hated that part. Even more so now that it hit a little close to home, stinging her more than it really should have. Yeah, sure it ends up being a misinterpreting of signs‚Äîthe boxing girl was actually his childhood friend‚Äîbut that didn‚Äôt matter in the face of the despair at the time of the scene.

*‚ÄúWhy did she drop the food? Does she not care for her own cooking?‚Äù* Akula asked loudly.

*‚ÄúBecause Remiru took the male, obviously!‚Äù* Oliver shot back from the other side of the couch, pausing his note-taking for a split moment. *‚ÄúNow silence!‚Äù*

The technician shot him a thankful look. He sat beside her with Javelin on his opposite flank. The guardswoman barely even noticed anything else going on as her dilated pupils shined and reflected the screen‚Äôs light. She leaned forward, four elbows braced against her knees to allow her to be as close to the television as possible without falling off of the cushion. Hell, her tail was even wrapped around the backrest to keep her anime-watching perfectly stable.

The overseer huffed, holding her hands out in confusion and frustration. *‚ÄúWhy would that matter? Just because there is one female does not mean she has lost her chance to mate.‚Äù*

Tracy leaned back into her seat between the Malkrin, groaning. ‚ÄúFor you, maybe‚Ä¶ This is an important part for Asuka.‚Äù

Oliver perked up out of her peripheral. *‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù*

She crossed her arms over her chest, staring into her lap with an annoyed huff. ‚ÄúHumans don‚Äôt usually‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ *pair up* like that. We uh‚Ä¶ do one-on-one, for the most part.‚Äù

*‚ÄúSo half your females are expected to go without mating?‚Äù* Akula jabbed, leaning over the technician. *‚ÄúWould that not require more competition?‚Äù*

‚ÄúN-No, people aren‚Äôt forced out of mati‚Äî I mean‚Ä¶ *yeah*, I guess, but it‚Äôs not because there‚Äôs a lack of men around,‚Äù Tracy sputtered back, sinking further into the couch.

The craftsman jotted a few things down in his notebook, raising a brow toward the only human in the room. *‚ÄúI thought you mentioned this ‚Äòanime‚Äô included a harem? Are your kind singular or multiple in your pairing? I had thought the former before, but now I am left quite confused‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The technician covered her forehead and eyes with a palm, trying to hide her discomfort. Did they really have to put her on blast for how little she knew about the ‚Äòdating game?‚Äô ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ some guys want that‚Ä¶ I think, but it‚Äôs not exactly *feasible*. I-I don‚Äôt know. People are different‚Ä¶‚Äù

*‚ÄúHmmm. Then‚Ä¶ I presume you are not aware of what Harrison wants?‚Äù* the overseer queried with devious curiosity.

She could see the olive-skinned Malkrin nod through the cracks between her fingers. If she could descend any further into the malleable furnishing, she might vanish forever into the cushion dimension. She could only mumble out her mind at that point. ‚ÄúDoes fucking *anyone* know what Harrison wants?‚Äù

*‚ÄúPerhaps we should ask him, then,‚Äù* Akula offered, nearly causing Tracy to fall over when she stood up, her removed weight unbalancing the entire couch with a creak.

No way she was serious, right? A pit formed in the technician‚Äôs stomach at the prospect. *Of course she was serious.* Tracy tore her hand away from her face, holding it out in protest. ‚ÄúWo-hohohho, waitwaitwait. Nuh-n-n-no. *Noooooooo*. Let‚Äôs *not* do that.‚Äù

*‚ÄúNonsense. I am curious. Follow me if you wish,‚Äù* Akula stated dismissively, walking away from the living room.

Tracy scrambled out of her seat after the green-skinned fucker, Oliver following suit. Javelin was completely unfazed, remaining in the same position in all the confusion. The technician jogged down the stairs behind the overseer, barely managing to keep up with her long-legged stride.

‚ÄúThis *really* isn‚Äôt necessary. He‚Äôs probably busy right now! We shouldn‚Äôt be bothering him,‚Äù she pleaded.

Akula waved her off with a ‚Äòshoo-shoo‚Äô motion, already pushing through the barracks door. *‚ÄúI disagree. Perhaps it is imprudent to do so to our patriarch, but this is important for the future of the settlement by other means.‚Äù*

The technician kicked the closing door open, slipping out right behind the overseer into the frigid outside. The roiling anxiety only grew, searing into her. ‚ÄúNo? What? What the fuck does that even mean? We **really** don‚Äôt need to be asking him this!‚Äù

The dark green-skinned Malkrin didn‚Äôt respond, merely continuing to the workshop with self-assured strides.

*‚ÄúShe is referring to how the Creator‚Äôs view on pairing may affect his success as a leader. Females drive the future of their mate,‚Äù* Oliver stated matter-of-factly, keeping up with Tracy‚Äôs pace. He drew a small smile like a fascinated biologist studying an animal, still holding onto his notebook and pen as he jogged.

A dozen failed attempts at speaking left her mouth dry, her lips and tongue failing to come together to form a coherent sentence in her exasperation. What the actual fuck was going on? Why did they have to be so damn curious? Why did it matter to them so much? He wasn‚Äôt even going to give them a normal answer! They didn‚Äôt understand Humans in the slightest. It wasn‚Äôt like he would just say some shit like ‚Äòyeah, I‚Äôm open to a poly relationship‚Äô or fucking *whatever* response the Malkrin were hoping for. Absolutely ridiculous!

The workshop drew closer and closer, her dread peaking as she tore into the main doorway. She suddenly didn‚Äôt want to be there at all. What would it look like to Harrison if she was just standing behind Akula as she asked such a direct question? Fucking *weird* is what it would look like! Tracy couldn‚Äôt be in sight. She wouldn‚Äôt be able to bear the embarrassment of being even remotely associated with it. There was absolutely no hope in stopping the overseer, so all the technician could do was watch from afar and bank on staying hidden‚Äîshe wanted to at least see what his reaction was. His response had a snowflake‚Äôs chance in hell of being anything more than terse, but some hidden part of her hoped it would at least give her *something* in terms of how he viewed relationships.

Would he be dismissive? Curious? Indifferent? All Tracy needed was the tiniest clue that he wasn‚Äôt completely opposed to having more than whatever he already shared with her‚Ä¶ It was a vain hope, a small glimmer that resided in her heart that she wouldn‚Äôt be in a perpetual limbo of hugs and arms-distance appreciation.

The technician winced at the thought as she crept around a tall machine within the workshop. Was she really in a perpetual limbo? She had exactly what she wanted, and she was still complaining like a spoiled brat. She yearned and begged and damn near cried on several occasions for a chance to have her nightmares dulled by his care‚Äîand she had that! Just yesterday, he reached out to her. His embrace lifted her sinking heart, his warmth numbed the suffocating anxiety, and his voice‚Ä¶ Oh, his *voice*. That short whisper of ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not alone‚Äô broke her entirely, gelatin legs leaving a collapsed husk for him to hold up. She could still feel the strain on her fingers as she clung to him then. It was reassurance she never knew she needed so badly. Those simple words brought her up from depths she thought she would never be able to leave.

Then there was last night, when she closed her eyes for the first time without being met with the darkness of the cargo bay. She couldn‚Äôt recall what dreams she had, but the fact that it wasn‚Äôt the same damn nightmare meant everything to her. It might‚Äôve been the first time she got a full night's rest since before crash-landing on this planet. Not to mention waking up warm with his arms around her. He even went out of his way to ask her how she was feeling that morning, their interaction the previous day still fresh on his mind. She always knew he cared somewhat, but directly seeing it through his words and actions swelled her heart, cutting through the remnants of her worries and pains. The last two days were like a breath of fresh air, giving her the freedom to do more than distract herself with work or menial entertainment.

So maybe she did have a lot to be grateful for, but the brief sparks that ran across her skin with his touch and his tender investment in her well-being left her wanting more in its absence. How could she not be a little selfish? Here she was, on this distant alien planet filled with horrors and the graves of however many thousands of colonists, and he offered her a well of comfort and stability outside the thin veneer of normalcy from video games and coding. There was so much to be had beyond an embrace here and a conversation there. She wanted his *love*, not just the kindness that he drip-fed her day by day. She pined for more of his presence, to be engulfed wholly by the man who saw her through the terrors with a smile. 

‚Ä¶But she knew better than to throw herself at him. He was just doing his own thing all the time, neck-deep in the infinite line of projects he had queued up. How could she even approach him? ‚ÄòHey I want to take your attention away from ensuring our settlement doesn‚Äôt fall apart.‚Äô It was impossible. What did she even have to offer that he wanted? Someone kind to talk to? A pretty face? A warm body? Was Tracy his type? Did he even have a type? How could she know? Again, she couldn‚Äôt even approach him about half of this shit without making what little progress she accrued look half desperate and half alienating!

The technician sighed deeply, returning her gaze to Akula, who was stomping through the rows of machines, Oliver slinking behind her. Tracy softly gripped the side of a metallic support structure, peeking out around it. Harrison was sat at his desk as always. He looked lost in whatever was on his screen‚Äîa written document, if her blurry eyes were correct. A massive maroon form took up the rest of his desk, the mound of muscle and frills apparently being fast asleep with her chin atop four folded arms.

‚Ä¶Pleeease stay asleep. Out of all the people to listen in on Harrison‚Äôs opinion over relationships, Shar‚Äôkhee had to be the last person who Tracy wanted to hear‚Ä¶ Maybe? She‚Ä¶ she still didn‚Äôt know how to feel about the Malkrin, or what she even wanted. Maybe she had interest in Harrison, but she genuinely seemed intent on just seeing him in good health‚Ä¶ Should the technician be jealous? Accepting? Indifferent? The big ‚Äòol paladin was just a massive unknown at that point. She was doing a lot to keep Harrison sane when Tracy wasn‚Äôt there trying to help‚Äîgetting a bit‚Ä¶ *physical* at times. It filled Tracy‚Äôs stomach with acidic resentment, but she couldn‚Äôt quite stay envious, given the maroon-colored shark genuinely just had his best interests at heart. It was a back-and-forth in her mind over whether or not to be grateful the only other guy on the planet wasn‚Äôt going to collapse under the pressure and do something he might regret, while also internally growing bitter that she didn‚Äôt have the social right to get close to him as the paladin did‚Ä¶

Akula crossed the final stretch. Harrison noticed her, barely nodding his head in greeting. The overseer wasted no time, standing tall above him and apparently asking a question. He leaned backward in his seat defensively, but his expression melded into confusion as the dark green-skinned Malkrin continued.

Tracy couldn‚Äôt hear a single thing he said, but his flat stare told of indifference. Just as she thought he would react‚Ä¶ The eight-foot-tall alien leaned over him, staring him down with seriousness, causing him to look away, hand scratching at the back of his neck. The smallest motions of his jaw implied he was speaking much quieter. What more did he have to say? Did Akula squeeze something out of him? Harrison ended his response with a shrug and a frown, pointing a thumb to his work. The overseer raised a brow and stood up straight, nodding at the sleeping paladin and then once more to the entrance of the workshop. What was she saying now? The engineer recoiled, his eyes widening and cheeks reddening. He waved his hands in front of him vigorously as if vehemently denying accusations. His surprise soon turned into a frustrated glare once Akula tried to poke him again with whatever queries she had. She froze as soon as he turned face, suddenly falling into line again, bowing her head low in apology. Harrison waved her off with a huff, turning back to his work.

‚Ä¶So what the hell was that all about? Tracy sneakily rounded the row of machines she hid behind, finding the overseer in the small hallway just before the exit door, intercepting her on her way out of the workshop. She still wasn‚Äôt exactly pleased with what Akula did. She called out to her, an irked edge in the facade of her flat voice.

‚ÄúWhat did he say?‚Äù

The overseer paused, looking over her shoulder dismissively as if expecting Tracy to be there. *‚ÄúHe stated he could not bring himself to think of such things at a time like this.‚Äù*

The technician cut her eyes in a squint. ‚ÄúAnd after that?‚Äù

The Malkrin smirked, a singular huff of laughter leaving her. *‚ÄúI thought you did not care to hear what he had to say.‚Äù*

‚ÄúFuck off. I thought we were working together. Tell me what he said,‚Äù Tracy demanded, jabbing a finger toward the alien.

The snide bitch crossed her arms, turning around halfway. Her glowing eyes seemed to burn with a devilish interest. *‚ÄúWorking together? Our goals only meet in one aspect‚Ä¶ However, for your benefit, I will tell you that when pressed about such matters as mating, he admitted his greatest worry would be balancing his work and the care of those he loves. He would feel regretful if he could not give his undivided attention to one, much less the added complexity of two.‚Äù*

The human shook her head in confusion. ‚ÄúSo, what? We already knew he was busy with his work. What did you say after to get him all defensive? Why‚Äôd you point to Shar?‚Äù

The squad leader‚Äôs smug grin grew wider. *‚ÄúYou certainly ask plenty of questions now that the difficult part has been done for you‚Ä¶ All you need to know is that fate has already decided upon your battle. The only loser of the bout between the four of us shall be me.‚Äù*

Tracy‚Äôs face contorted into bewilderment. She threw her arms out wide, her voice subtly echoing in the hallway. ‚ÄúWhat the hell does that mean? The fuck are you talking about with ‚Äòbattles?‚Äô‚Äù

Akula took in a deep breath through her nostrils, turning around. She waved a singular hand into the air as she began to walk off. *‚ÄúYou only need to sacrifice but one thing, and find common ground with her. Then, all shall fall into place like turbulent silt to the ocean floor.‚Äù*

The enigmatic green female slipped out of the doorway, leaving the pioneer to stand there, dazed and unsure of anything. She somehow had more questions than she had coming into the whole ordeal. What battle? What did she need to sacrifice? Who did she need to find common ground with?

The technician rubbed her face with both hands, subconsciously turning around as if to enter the workshop again. She thought of Harrison working and Shar sleeping beside him, considering pulling up a seat and making conversation in lieu of anything else to do. She didn‚Äôt know what the hell she was supposed to do now. All her thoughts were dragged back to Akula‚Äôs words.

 *‚Äòfind common ground with **her**‚Äô*.

With Sharky? How? Over what? The only subject she could think of would be Harrison, but why‚Äî

A lightning bolt of realization stuck into her.

Of course it would be over Harrison.

Then, what battle was won?

1hoxmau,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longcovidgutdysbiosis/comments/1hoxmau/my_15_yr_journey_positive_nonlinear_update/,My 1.5 yr journey: positive non-linear update.,"Hello!

April-August 2023 was the worst time of my life hands down. I remember vividly breaking down almost every day due to severe panic attacks / histamine attacks, which fed each other and snow balled heavily. Today, so many moons later, I can confidently say I am almost healed. Almost! 

I'll start by saying it was really quite hard, and I wanted to 'let go' many times. I'm glad I didn't, and part of me wanted to beat this out of spite (big F U to all the idiot doctors I saw around then). If you're ever heard the old word ""Chutzpah"" my father used to call me a ""chutzpah-neet,"" it's a big part of my personality.  
  
Here's what's worked for my *long covid / histamine intolerance / leaky gut / vagal nerve dysfunction / hydrogen but not methane SIBO (SIBO-D) / candida overgrowth*:

* Exercise after meals
   * especially light biking, yoga, or walking. Something about the increased breathing helps.
* Hot baths 
   * especially before going to bed w/ epsom salt as I was low on magnesium
   * specially if I am actively having a histamine rxn ---> it often stops it!
* Allegra
   * The 12hr one not the 24 hr one, in the mornings with food. 
   * I often called it my 'anti-psychotic'
* The Align Brand Probiotic
   * I started with the low-dose one, 2/week. Now take one with breakfast AND dinner.
   * My seq results showed no bifido, if you have methane-dominant SIBO maybe makes it worse!
   * I started passing gas again like a week into taking Align. I literally cried of joy.
* Histamine-low diet with NO carbs, much soup -- then transition --> increase FODMAPS!
   * I have a good few months I was meat/salmon only + low histamine veggies. 
   * The second I could, I introduce medium histamine veggies: I had frozen bags of all veggies. I would literally have a dinner of 2 lb steak + 1 asparagus, 1 brussel sprout, 3 baby carrots, 1 bell pepper, 1 cauliflower floret, 1 brocolli floret, etc. 
      * Variety is so good for u. like so good for your gut. EVEN 1 broccoli is better than none!
   * Over time, started to crave more veggies. literally crave brussel sprouts. I listened to those cravings and started eating as many veggies as I could. 
   * I would roast them in my air frier DOUSED in olive oil and salt. I did not lose any weight LMAO.
   * To this day, my dinners are meat and assorted veggies. I find carbs (rice, potatoes, etc.) are fun if I know I am going to bike home after my meal (i.e. like after a restaurant outing). If not, it's not worth the lower quality sleep I get. 
   * Every sunday I would throw lamb shoulder chops (w/ the bone!!) from costco into my instant pot for 1 hr with veggies (leek/celery, carrots, peppers, zucchini, parnsip, kale, cauliflower, caraway seeds, lemongrass, later also brussels) NO CARBS. Freeze in containers while still hot!
      * microwave this at work for like 10 minutes as an easy lunch.
      * It has been an ENTIRE YEAR of eating THIS lamb stew EVERY DAY for lunch. I am now the soup master. And I believe the collagen in the bones helps my gut. 
* Fasting ://///////////////// 
   * I like to do a gentle fast once per month:
      * skip dinner on friday nights --> sat morning black coffee and nuun tablet w/ vitC 
      * 2 hrs later I take a¬†*Biocidin G.I. Detox+ Gentle Binder*¬†and a HOT bath to relax my muscles 
      * 2-3 hrs later coco water and gentle stretching 
      * early sat evening break fast with boiled carrots and then other easy veg, then meat. NO CARBS. 
   * 1/month for the last 12 months. I truly believe this ""soft fasting"" regime it has healed my leaky gut. I call it my ""shabbat routine"" and have implemented other traditional shabbat rules (no working, cooking, cleaning, electronics, etc.). Easy to do without a kid, but necessary for my wellbeing. 
   * I had HIGH candida, I believe this and the low carb diet killed it!!!! yay. it sucked!!!!!!! but now I can have milK!!!!!!!!
   * My recently acquired friend with severe long covid claims his twice A WEEK water fasts restored his life. That's too much for me, but you do you. 
   * There's plenty of evidence that intermittent fasting / full on fasting changed your gut microbiome. If you do so, please take water with electrolytes so you dont die thnx <3

  
I tried a shit ton of stuff that didn't work and did very little!!!!!!!!! I think eventually I'll make a post about these things. 

Things I have tried in the last few months that maybe are working:

* BodyBio Gut Sodium Butyrate AKA 'the cheese pill'
   * smells like parmesan cheese 
   * gives me \~weird farts\~ and \~AWFUL dream\~
   * I weirdly crave it? So I continue to take it 2-3 times per week with lunch.
* Doctor's Best PepZin GI, Zinc-L-Carnosine Complex
   * 1 per week between meals. 
   * If it does anything, I can't tell. I will probably finish the bottle and then move on with my life

  
Why do I think I'm healed? Well, other than feeling better in every aspect of my life. I recently started craving dried apricots!!!! And now i can eat eggs!!!!!!!!!! WTF GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So yes, 1.5 yrs later.................. I'm getting better!!!!!!!!!!!! I thought this was it for the rest of my life. But NO. F those dumb doctors. 

!!!! TLDR I had severe candida/SIBO-D (hydrogen)/histamine intolerance. Regular routine of Allegra/Align Probiotic/histamine diet with **slow** ramp up of fodmaps/monthly water fasts with a binder = actual progress. The #1 things that helped were regular exercise, correct probiotics, and time. !!!!!  
  
It was nonlinear, but healing journeys rarely are! And I WILL relapse, but now I know what to do! so yay progress.",14,1735484216.0,Longcovidgutdysbiosis,3,1.0,False

1hoxko4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1hoxko4/has_anyone_else_never_really_enjoyed_going_to/,Has anyone else never really enjoyed going to pubs sober?,"Hello all. 

So there have probably been a few posts on this sub about this topic already, but I was just curious if anyone else never really enjoyed going to pubs sober? 

For context, I am a life-long nondrinker. I just never really cared for alcohol, and I also grew up in a house where nobody drank or had much interest in it. 

With that said, I have gone to pubs sober on special occasions, such as for someone‚Äôs birthday, a wedding etc, but often times, my parents and I were frequently the only ones not drinking. 

I am from Ireland for context, and a lot of social life here especially outside the major cities tends to revolve either around the pub or some sort of sports. 

In the times when I did go to pubs sober I found them for the most part to be incredibly boring places. It didn‚Äôt take long for many people to become pissed drunk, sometimes within the space of an hour or 2. They quickly started to become very annoying, getting progressively louder with each drink and quickly reverting to repeating themselves over and over again. Added to that, I have much better hearing than the average person because I am a blind person so I often found these places to be quite unpleasant environments. 

I was only talking about this to my parents the other day, they have often wondered how they didn‚Äôt end up like most of the people they grew up with. Most people my parents grew up with turned into raging alcoholics and shadows of their former selves. It appeared that most of their lives revolved around the pub and getting drunk, which I suppose looking back was not too surprising as the church and the pub have been a sort of linchpin of Irish culture as it has stood for generations. 

I think things are slowly changing in the bigger cities at least such as Dublin or Galway and Dublin at least has around 2 or 3 late night cafes, but whether they are doing well or not is another story, but it seems that rural areas and smaller cities such as my own have been set up like this as far back as I can remember where there are few alternatives to pubs for social outlets in the evenings. 

Most of our locally owned cafes here close at 4 5 pm, and the only cafe open in the city at night is Starbucks. Places such as late evening cafes are all but nonexistent , which I think really is a crying shame as this is much more prevalent on the European continent, and I feel in more recent times at least people are dying for more places to go in the evenings other than chain coffee places or the pub. 

Thankfully I have a lot of other hobbies and things to do to keep me busy. I hope going forward though that at some point we will have a lot more late night places to go that aren‚Äôt just pubs, bars or nightclubs. ",4,1735484073.0,stopdrinking,12,1.0,False

Hey folks,

I‚Äôm currently looking to upgrade my machine from a bambino non-pro.  

Right now, I have it down to maybe 3 options in the $1500 Canadian range. 

1 - a gaggiuino. This seems the coolest.  As an engineer, I think I would have no issues building it. However, I realize that I‚Äôm still working with the parts of a $500 machine and using software tricks to compensate for the hardware. Being the cheapest option ( even after mods) is very appealing but I‚Äôd like something that others can use without much training.

2 - Profitec go. I can get one for $1400 CAD which is pretty solid, and I think it‚Äôs the ‚Äúbest single boiler‚Äù around. No tinkering required, just good coffee. 

3 - a lelit  Anna 2 with PID. Seems very similar to the Profitec but cheaper at $1000 Cad. Would I notice the difference in quality?

I enjoy how quickly I can go from shot to steam on the bambino and realize I would have that luxury on the single boiler machines but space and budget constraints wouldn‚Äôt let me go to a dual boiler.

We do not have kids. I‚Äôm not the type of guy who thinks just because I work and she doesn‚Äôt, she should do everything else. I cook most of our meals, help with dishes, and do what I can around the house. But I‚Äôll admit ‚Äì I procrastinate, sometimes a lot, a personality trait I have been struggling with since my childhood.

A few days ago, she asked me to do the ironing on the weekend since she was out with her family most of the weekdays that week. I said I‚Äôd do it later because I had to apply for new jobs. By the evening, I was mentally drained. She was tired too, and when she went to bed, I asked if I could do the ironing the next day. She said okay. But instead of resting, I played video games for a while.

The next day, she wanted to organize my room with me. I wasn‚Äôt into it, but I didn‚Äôt say anything. As we cleaned, we found a months-old, rotting piece of cake in my work bag in a place I never use. I remember getting that piece there a few months ago but totally forgot about it. She got really upset and said, ‚ÄúWhenever you procrastinate, I have to deal with it.‚Äù

I tried to play it cool and lighten the mood, but she was clearly getting more annoyed. By nighttime, she softened, and we reconciled without actually talking about the issue. I know we should have talked when possible, but we were both busy throughout the week. She had a huge number of guests to visit her in a few days, I had a very busy week in my job, and I was trying to find a new job in whatever free time I had.

Fast forward a few days later ‚Äì I had a packed schedule with meetings and job applications, but I still managed to make breakfast and clean up the kitchen before she woke up. I then proceeded to work a little and joined a few meetings until I had to go to the office to deliver a document.

She had been cooking all day for her upcoming guests. When I was finally free and took the dog out around 6 PM, she said, ‚ÄúOh, now you walk the dog?‚Äù I told her I‚Äôd been swamped, and she just rolled her eyes. I walked the dog the previous night, by the way ‚Äì she does 2 walks a day 90% of the time.

Later, I tried to get close and help with dishes, but she exploded. She said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been four days! I forgave you without talking, but ever since we got married, I‚Äôm the one dealing with everything you put off! Set your priorities straight!‚Äù

I tried explaining that I thought walking the dog later was okay, but she stormed out. I have to add, walking the dog is not exclusively my responsibility, but whenever I am available, I do it. I stayed home, cleaned the kitchen, and waited. She went to her friend‚Äôs place and didn‚Äôt return until late. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, so I tracked her location on Find My (we share locations) and saw she was just sitting in the car for 15 minutes after getting home. When I went to check on her, she locked the doors and ignored me.

I waited outside in the cold for half an hour before giving up and waiting inside near the door. After she didn‚Äôt come in for 15 minutes, I went to check on her again. She eventually rushed past me, locked herself in her dressing room, and slept in a separate room.

The next morning, I had a full-day workshop that I was a moderator of. I woke up early and rushed to work at 6 AM. The guests were coming that day, but I was not invited as it was a girls‚Äô night. After leaving work at 6 PM, I just sat in my car around the city until 1 AM. When I went home, there were no guests, and she appeared to be rushed to bed, stopping whatever she was doing. I just went near her and kissed her, then proceeded to clean up the rest of the house.

When I was done, I went to bed, but she was in the bathroom. I was waiting for her but fell asleep. When I woke up, she was not sleeping with me. She was in another room. I made her breakfast and left a rose I picked up while walking the dog. I left it by her side with a kiss, but she didn‚Äôt react. I made her coffee later and told her it was in the kitchen. She didn‚Äôt acknowledge me.

Since then, we haven‚Äôt spoken. She barely leaves her room, and I check in occasionally to see if she needs anything. I noticed she‚Äôs writing on her computer and hides the screen when I pass by.

TL;DR:  
I procrastinated on chores, my wife got frustrated, and it escalated over a few days. Now she‚Äôs emotionally distant, and I‚Äôm not sure how to approach her or make things right.",3,1735483278.0,relationship_advice,103,0.62,False

My husband (40M) and I (34F) Just got off of 7 nights on Wonder of the Seas. We had a really great trip. 

The ship was stunning, very clean, new, and well cared for. The customer service was excellent. Haven‚Äôt see such wonderful customer service since pre-covid. It was great. 

The food was good. We enjoyed the Solarium Bistro breakfast buffet and the main dining room each night. Im not sure why people hate on this place? The drinks were normal strength. I think comments about them being watered down are from just eating much more than you normally do at home. 

The Ice Skating show and the Intense Aqua Show were both great. Very talented performers. 

The are two great spots in the back of the ship- Deck 16 beautiful view with adirondack chairs where we watched each sail away. Deck 5 a lovely quiet place down by the water, drank my coffee and read here every morning, listened to the waves. 

All of our port adventures were great. Did Orient Beach with Lunch in St. Maarten. Beautiful beach, great lunch. Did Hideaway Beach on Coco Cay. 5-stars to the heated infinity pool with swim up bar. Awesome. In St. Thomas we rented a floating AquaCabana at Emerald Bay. So cool, another amazing beach day. 

I was ‚Äúwarned‚Äù that going Christmas week would be full of crazy children. Complete opposite experience, the children were very well behaved. It was a few adults that were the problems- mothers screaming at their kids, women doing hair in the buffet line after they washed their hands, Karens at guest services, drunk guy arguing with lifeguard at Coco Cay. Zero problems with the kids. 

Two minor complaints/ notes on what to expect a) the windjammer was mayhem every time we went in there. The food was good. But it was so crowded, it was nearly impossible to walk around or find a table. They need to have more of these food places open after 9am. Which takes me to be next point. b) The flexibility of the dining was much better on Carnival. (Sorry Royal, but this is one area for you to take notes.) On this trip, most breakfast options stopped at 9 or 9:30 or else be stuck at crazy windjammer. It‚Äôs vacation, give ppl more time to sleep in. I missed Sea Day brunch. Also the MyTime dining was not as easy here, on Carnival you can easily join the waitlist from the app and we could not do that here. 

Overall such a great trip. It was my husband‚Äôs first RC cruise and he‚Äôs sold. I think we‚Äôre here to stay. ",1,1735483055.0,royalcaribbean,1,1.0,False

2. Throw of the headlight on low beam is extremely poor. Might seriously consider upgrading to better headlamps next year. 
3. City drive mode (of the 3 drive modes) is honestly really badly tuned. It gives lower mileage than Sports mode, is really jerky and works poorly when there are 3-4 passengers. I‚Äôve actually used sports mode the most for my daily drives alone as well, getting mileage between 13-14 kmpl in city traffic. 

On a side note - I also feel that 2019 Nexons were far better built than the current day Tata cars. I believe it‚Äôs got more to do with the fact that Tata was a brand fighting to reach the top spot that time, which meant they had better quality control, better paint quality, better products overall. Now that it‚Äôs a proper mass brand and their dealerships experience is awful, I truly hope Tata finds its way back to the 2019-zone which made me, a first time buyer at the age of 24, truly trust them with my hard earned money!",3,1735482899.0,CarsIndia,1,1.0,False

I will be travelling to Bergamo from the 12th of january till the 14th.
The purpose of my trip is a mix of work and leisure. I am a 42 year old guy from the Netherlands who is always interested in meeting new people abroad. I am married and I have a child, so no romantic intentions  what so ever :) 
I am interested in all sorts of things, travelled a lot all over the world and open to new perspectives; sports, politics, music, art etc. Maybe you can show me a nice place in Bergamo if you'd like?
Are you interested in meeting up for dinner or a Italian coffee, please let me know.
We can practice English, or just have fun sharing anything thats in our common interests.

Hope to see you there!

Joseph

1hox66q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1hox66q/first_solstice_scent_order_howd_i_do/,First Solstice Scent order! How'd I do? ,"NOT REVIEWS! (not yet at least) I wanted to share what I got and give little comments on my reason for picking that particular scent. I decided to go all in on my first SS purchase and make a splash, there are a few I wish were in stock ie. Winter Dove, Farmhouse in Fall, Estate Lavender, Estate Cacao (the 90ml blind buy is out of the question) Blossom Jam Teacakes, Victorian Tea Room etc. etc. I was considering going for a freebie of Lace Draped Specter but I wanted my first foray into Solstice's carnation note to be Winter Dove instead, and because carnations remind me of Valentine's Day in high school and I'm not in a hurry to relive those days.. ever. Ah well, those ones being out of stock gives me an excuse to make another SS order later. (Solstice's notes appeal to me so much it's not even funny) 

**BLACKBURN FARMSTEAD**

**Blackberry Jam, Boysenberry Preserves, Vanilla Bean, Creamy Vanilla and a touch of Vanilla Musk \*\*Reformulated 2016\*\*. Extrait/WS/BG. Oil based extrait. GOURMAND/FRUITY. Fall Collection**

My only perfume with a blackberry note is Cocoa Pink‚Äôs Blackberry Tea so safe to say the scope of my knowledge when it comes to blackberry scents is limited. When I think of blackberries I‚Äôm reminded of these Driscoll‚Äôs ‚Äúsweetest batch‚Äù blackberries that I shared with my mom a few years ago and have been chasing ever since. (I cannot wait until summer and they‚Äôre in season again.) I‚Äôm also really excited for the creamy vanilla aspect of it as well, I love vanilla, so this seemed like a safe bet.¬†

**BLACKBURN PARLOR**

**Vanilla Waffle Bowl, Vanilla & Chocolate Ice Creams, Banana, Caramel, Whipped Cream. Extrait/EDP/WS/BG/BS. Oil based extrait. GOURMAND. General Catalog.**

A full blown gourmand like this is out of my comfort zone, but it seemed pretty well received here on IMAM and that banana note intrigues me. I wonder if it‚Äôs more akin to the usual Cavendish variety or if it‚Äôs more like what those small banana candies are.¬†

**MANOR**

**Woody-Vanilla Musk, Vanilla, Agarwood (Oud), Sandalwood. Extrait/EDP/WS/BG. Oil based extrait. WOODY/VANILLA MUSK. General Catalog.**

An IMAM beloved, so I wanted to see what the hype was about. I‚Äôm not usually one for woody scents, but that vanilla.. it just entices me so much.¬†

**MIDNIGHT EYE**

**Dark Coffee, Cigar Leaf, Cacao, Carob, Tonka, Labdanum, Aged Patchouli, Fossilized Amber, Cigar Ash, Oud**

Not many reviews for this one on IMAM so it‚Äôs really a blind buy for me. I‚Äôm still chasing a scent that‚Äôs adjacent to Alkemia‚Äôs Misdeeds after Midnight until it‚Äôs restocked (hopefully). I‚Äôve tried other Alkemia coffee scents and they just don‚Äôt do it for me. One was oddly sour and the other was nauseatingly sweet (excluding Club de Hashichins which I have to purchase a sample of.) I just want a strong and rich black coffee supplemented with other dark and smooth notes and this seems like just that.¬†

**NIGHTGOWN**

**Vanilla, White Chocolate, Tuberose & Tiare Flowers. Extrait/EDP/WS/BG. Oil based extrait. FLORAL/GOURMAND. General Catalog.**

A safe purchase, I love white florals, I love vanilla, and I‚Äôm starting to warm up to white chocolate. Although my area of knowledge regarding white florals is centered around jasmine, I want to branch out a bit more.¬†

**POSTPRANDIAL**

**Vanilla, Irish Cream, Coffee, Chocolate, Bourbon, Pipe Tobacco. Alcohol based extrait. Not safe for pregnant/nursing. Extrait/EDP. GOURMAND/LIQUEUR/TOBACCO. Winter Collection.**

I had to decide between this one and SS‚Äô vanilla pipe tobacco since they seemed similar to me. If I like SS‚Äô pipe tobacco note I might pick up the other one as well. But this on paper seems like a nice gourmand, I‚Äôd like to wear it on cold winter mornings.¬†

**ROSE MALLOW CREAM**

**Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk. Extrait/EDP. Oil based extrait. GOURMAND/FLORAL. General Catalog.**

Reminded me of Fantome‚Äôs Finist the Falcon**,** I‚Äôm not sure why I don‚Äôt really reach for my full size of FInist but there‚Äôs something about it that I‚Äôm iffy about. Oh! It reminds me of Turkish delights in the way that it‚Äôs powdery and like.. grandma-esque. It‚Äôs like I get a weird mouthful of dust, but in my nose. I hope this is more gourmand than rose.¬†

**SNOWMINT MALLOW**

**Peppermint, Vanilla Cake, Sugar Cookies, Flaked Coconut & Marshmallow Cr√®me. Extrait/EDP/BG. Oil based extrait. GOURMAND. Winter Collection.**

I don‚Äôt usually go for winter gourmands, and I barely consider Alkemia‚Äôs For love of winter to be a winter gourmand so this is also newish territory for me. But the notes just sound so good, all I‚Äôm asking is that the coconut isn‚Äôt all up in my face.¬†

**SOLSTICE MAGNOLIA**

**Lemon-Magnolia ice cream, sugar cone, Hawaiian sandalwood, honeysuckle, thumbprint cookies with quince jam, unsweetened iced black tea. Extrait/EDP. Oil based extrait. GOURMAND/FLORAL. Summer Collection.**

I‚Äôm really surprised at how evocative SS‚Äô notes are from just reading them, this one just seemed right up my alley. I think I‚Äôm also romanticizing summer days, even when I know fully well that I will be cursing anything and everything when I‚Äôm suffering through humid and muggy days. I don‚Äôt have a lot of perfumes that have magnolia in them either.¬†

**SUGARVALE**

**Reformulated 2020. Candied Pecans, Butterscotch, Buttered Rum, Brown Sugar, Maple Syrup, Hot Pralines & Milk Chocolate Cocoa. Extrait/Glace/Whipped Soap. GOURMAND. Winter Collection.**

I wanted to try at least one ‚Äúsugar-bomb‚Äù perfume from SS and between Foxcroft Fair Grounds, Gibbon‚Äôs Mischief Night and this one, Sugarvale was the most appealing. The other two just seemed like too much to me. I‚Äôm also kind of wary of cream soda and funnel cake notes. Funnel cake especially because I don‚Äôt want to smell like I was pulled out of the fryer.¬†¬†

**SPIRIT TREE**

¬†**Reformulated 2020. Gardenia, Vanilla, Jasmine, Sandalwood, Soft Woods blend, Orange Blossom, Magnolia. Extrait/EDP. Oil based extrait. FLORAL/WOODY. Summer Collection.**

My free sample! I overlooked this one initially but slowly going through the entire masterlist again was a good idea because I took a closer look at this. And on paper it seems like right up my alley! White florals and vanilla, are all things that I like. I‚Äôm not sure about the woody aspect of it though, I hope the florals shine through more. The last time I wore a sandalwood perfume it had a very odd sour smell to it, and I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs applicable to sandalwood in general or if it was just that perfume.¬†

**ORIENT ROSE**

**Sightly reformulated 2023. Rose Absolutes, Rose Ottos, Rose de Mai, Rose Attar, Tea Rose Accord, Vanilla Musk, White Musk, Ambergris (vegan), Amber, Indian Vetiver. Extrait/EDP. Oil based extrait. Not for pregnant/nursing. FLORAL/MUSK. Valentine‚Äôs Collection.**

My other free sample because this is my first order from SS! My only really rose forward/mainly rose perfume is Alkemia‚Äôs rose musk alchemy, and I wanted to see how they compared to each other. I want to learn if I really like rose or if I just like how Alkemia does them.¬†

**ESTATE VANILLA - Raw Vanilla Pods, Vanilla Infused Sugar, Cream & Vanilla Extract. Our Rich House Vanilla. EDP only. GOURMAND/VANILLA. General Catalog.**

Bought from a member of IMAM (thank you!) I‚Äôve seen it described as vanilla extract for baking and I‚Äôm completely in love. I love cracking open that bottle of extract to bake with, so if this is similar in any way I‚Äôd be over the moon.¬†

**ESTATE CITRUS GROVE**¬†

**Orange, Grapefruit, Orange Blossoms, Sweet Tea with Lemon, Estate Vanilla, Honeysuckle, Saffron, Yakusugi wood, Amber, Patchouli, Distant Coastal Wind**

Also bought from the same IMAM member, I didn‚Äôt even know this one existed until they mentioned it. It‚Äôs not on the masterlist but it just seemed so appealing that I had to pick up a decant anyway. I love citrus and having the opportunity to pick up a small decant and not jump straight to the 90ml seemed like a no brainer. I‚Äôve also been interested in picking up perfumes with a grapefruit note in it because it reminds me of my favorite character.¬†

I came to the UK August 2020 with 26 yrs old to live in London, started working as a delivery driver due some of the lockdown restrictions and lack of jobs, and was having a great time in my life financially and enjoying sightseeing, but as I was young never had a relationship before as I was focusing on saving some money to come to Europe since my family comes from Italy and I wanted to be close to Italian culture again. I had some casual sex, and I had with 4 to 5 people before nothing long, and then one day I met an woman(F) at the time she was 38 or 39 yrs old coming from a break up relationship after being married for 20 yrs, her ex at the time became gay. I had about couple times sex with her like for fun and enjoying because I didn‚Äôt do much it before and I was having fun but deep down I knew we were not made to be couple, but the same time both of us enjoyed the attention we were giving to each other, I come from a family where we call people, lovely, angel, nice, hugs, kisses in the cheek, probably a bit different from the English Culture. There was a day she asked me if we were a couple and I said No we are not we just enjoying each other, but also I don‚Äôt know how to explain or maybe I wasn‚Äôt very direct at the time I was feeling a different energy like a heavy energy I would say for both sides and I said to her I couldn‚Äôt do more casual sex to her or anyone cause the energy I got was overwhelming and I said I can be friends if you want I will stop casual sex. She said we could be friends but at the time I knew that wasn‚Äôt correct as well because could be confusing for both, and I think even when I was lonely I still at that time could have control of my thoughts, goals and dreams. So by 2021 when we stopped sex she went for dating but nothing serious happened for her and then our friendship became strong, because we were talking to each other everyday and having fun, I used to sing on the phone, laugh lots like talk my politics shit, talking about travelling, dreams, goals and everything I always have been free spirit.  So was a strong bond or connection as you can say.
By the time 2021 like September, October some of my friends started telling me - look it seems you guys are in a relationship instead of a friendship, everything you do is like what a couple do, this is not healthy for you and not healthy for her, and the time by I need to give more and more my energy to check how her day was to be a perfect friend and then I stopped looking after myself I started to over eat, I always had anxiety and my anxiety levels went up so much plus the stress of the job being self employed and driving around London a bike. At October 2021 a couple days before my birthday she came to visit me from countryside and i remember my friends telling me to stop that because both of us were completely attached to each other and that wasn‚Äôt healthy, wasn‚Äôt a real friendship with boundaries and everything because we were relying on each other for emotional support all the time, and as we were not a couple or having sex(which helps with the pillars for a relationship), the mental efforts to be there all time to give emotional support, to make her feel special and everything without sex was absolutely hard, I haven‚Äôt done sex because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt her or play with her feelings, but she felt played and used anyway. So at that day I had a major anxiety crisis and I said to her we need to part ways, what we are doing is not healthy, we are like a couple and this is making me confused, is confusing you and we need to part ways, that was my first heavy emotional drain in my mind, I cried lots, made her cry and everything and I was sure that time walk away was the best to do to both of us, cause it wasn‚Äôt healthy , but she was crying and said about rejection and everything and I felt sorry and I decided to stay with her and told all my friends to fuck off and then they all walked away cause they were tying to help me but I couldn‚Äôt see like that. So I went doctor started taking pills for anxiety Sertraline, because even I was stressed and and I thought the reason for it was my past trauma of being bullied in school my last 2 yrs which was severe bullied my self esteem was destroyed, they used to hurt me kicking and everything so was really bad, in the beginning of the bullying I was really strong with 17 yrs old, but then it was the whole class and stuffs and for 2 yrs was a hell studying at that school but I never said anything to my parents, but also coming from a religious family that struggled a lot financially and see many times parents arguments and created me a bit trauma of having relationships. So I took the pills and started to give less anxiety and for the other side I became extremely lazy and dismotivated.

2022 - I decided to start January going gym and look after myself to lose the 10 kgs I put on in myself and try to get my shit together again, so by march She went in a date kissed a guy and then went dating with him and then I thought they would start talking move on to a relationship or something, but instead She didn‚Äôt, and she came back to me all frustrated saying What have you done to me? And put some of shit in my face, and I will be honest at that time I was doing really well with money, gym lost the kilos and started to find ways to make more money or improve myself. But that day when she put all the shit on me I got so emotional drained again and gave up about everything as a weak man would do. I stopped going gym the emotional support I was giving was overwhelming and I never said to her it was cause I didn‚Äôt want to hurt. So but by April/ May 2022 I started to get my thinking worse, couldn‚Äôt reach my goals, couldn‚Äôt think straight and I was losing more myself in the emotional bond, I not going to lie I loved it because it gave me feelings i felt special because never had a relationship ship before, and with that I kept drinking Sertraline till 2023 July, by the time from 2022 January when I was 80 kgs, I end up with 108 kilos by September 2023, I absolutely lost myself in this, and when I started to get more weight I noticed myself in the mirror and I was feeling destroyed lower self esteem, and then I became fully dependent on her(may 2022), which should never happen. And I thought was because work stress but to compensate the mental effort I was overeating because everything I fought on goals and dreams was flying away.
Then a pattern of manipulation started from her side I don‚Äôt if she was scared of losing me or afraid or something, but everything I asked her like even small favours, or advices to buy stuffs for my place, since she is a woman she knows more about discounts quality‚Äôs and things. So I changed my bike with her help but with my money, bought couple things to my place with her advice and help with my money, but I always compensate her, taking to a nice meal, restaurant, sending money for coffee and things. And even doing this she started this pattern saying I was only friends for the things she could provide or give to me, but I was the one paying for everything and always trying to be thankful and compensate her. So in everything I asked like if she could help me I always compensate but it became a problem because always she used to put in my face when something happens between us, I said said several times I do care about you I appreciate your help and everything but you being hard, because it seems is because of you and not also my effort to work and buy things, and I mention so many times in the past 2 yrs the way she puts in my face is like affecting me like making me feel shit, totally different from someone else if they were going to help me. 

2023 - came and I was absolutely emotional attached and was difficult yr in everything in my life, I was lazy, taking big breaks to visit her in the countryside, lost in the goals and dreams, and I thought the problem was living in the big city and decided to move to the countryside next to her 15 Min close in Kent UK. I was so lost that I couldn‚Äôt also move on from my delivery job and everything.
So moved in Kent November 2023 and what is funny enough I sometimes have deep feelings and on December 23, we went TOB CAVERY to a roast dinner with her friends, and that day I felt absolutely cucco inside myself cause deep down I knew them before, but you know when you shouldn‚Äôt be there right? And I had the feeling I wouldn‚Äôt be in her life much longer, I panicked a bit and then forgot about it.

So 2024 - living in the countryside was good and I worked really hard my first months, so saved some 2 k in 4 months and was enjoying and a lot and then in April to May I started to be more friendly with my neighbour English girl, but nothing like sex or even relationship, just wanted to start making more friends and enjoy more the life in the country. She didn‚Äôt like much and to be honest started all again that emotions energy drain, in may I was so overwhelmed that I became desperate to go out the country for a 6 months break to try to get my shit together again, was absolutely hard, but then I didn‚Äôt tell her the truth and just told I wanted to go and find myself again, but her energy at the time was so much pressure that I stopped calling her all the caring names I used to call. 

So may was crazy, June a bit, but in July we travel for a week and then all were lovely again, then I got a job in a warehouse and I started to look after myself again going walks, 108 kilos September last year by December 2023 was 102, and by end of September 2024 was 95 kilos. I started to feel good again and then started to feel more sexually again since I have stopped Sertraline and as I lost weight started to feel the sex desire again and then where I fucked up on October, we had intimacy but then I didn‚Äôt fulfill her in what she wanted, she was upset and felt all rejected and everything and I know I shouldn‚Äôt have done or even tried because I just had a bit fun, but she always had hopes in having a relationship with me. So I said to her I couldn‚Äôt and told her would be better to her meet a man and start a relationship or something, and this times she listened to me went on a date had sex and then  days latter she was very different to me with the same questions again What is your problems with me and everything? I tried to explain I was a bit tired, but I was feeling emotional drained, I felt jealous as well to be honest and at that time when we were fine talking I saw a pattern of manipulation again, cause she was going date or a bit fun but using myself again as a emotional support and demanding words of affirmation, but at this time I was completely complete overwhelmed and dependent and I messaged her November 2024  we should walk away and stop this I don‚Äôt want to be manipulated, this is not right not ok, we have to stop seeing each other, going dinners, dog walk, coffee together and travel. 
And then we speak 5 days later when this happened and she said you are holding me back, that when I fully decided to let her go and also I said to her let me go. 

So couple weeks later beginning of December her daughter message me saying her mother is struggling with mental healthy and than I should Message her, because both of us can‚Äôt survive without each other. I replied saying we are still friends but I couldn‚Äôt be there anymore so I haven‚Äôt spoke to her since

December - 29/12/2024

I am in Belgium visiting my parents for holiday and I won‚Äôt lie since beginning of November when we stopped talking, I am feeling like shit, mentally drained, lost and all mixed feelings of hate sometimes, but I do know I really hurt her as well intentional and not intentional and I think she does think the same as well, but haven‚Äôt message her so far, sometimes I am reading articles about toxic here, or relation ship, friendship, situationship and I get desperate in the need of trying to message her and explain myself, but I know if I do it I will get myself lost all again, and if I eventually think in going back, the manipulation will be bigger and worse for me, since she already going having sex with people to find a relationship, don‚Äôt want to give emotional support like draining my energy. I want her to be happy and move on in her life and find someone who understands her and complete her, but I also think she still waiting my message cause I said I would
Message, but how can I message if am feeling so lost, confused, upset or allowing myself being manipulated intentional or not intentional? 

*****What would you guys do in my place, should stick with the no contact? I am not trying to punish anyone or trying to get her to message me first or anything like that, I am just doing this for myself, to get clarity, to see
My mistakes and improve them in a friendship or even in a relationship in the future, be a better human, trying to let it go these feeling of emotional drain, because I know if I eventually message I can say something that would hurt her more and sometimes being in silence is better. 

I still have her number and social media, I deleted my apps for the moment but also is not fair having to delete them to avoid to see her and everything after the hurt both of us caused to each other. I am am still absolutely lost, confused and trying to heal myself and in hope it doesn‚Äôt take longer than 6 months or something, but I know for the first time in my life coming back is not a option, also I don‚Äôt think we can be friends in the future as well? Cause it was bad for both sides and I don‚Äôt feel I could have a honest friendship after this, any advice???

I am coming back to the gym next week and will try to heal myself and it hurts so bad now things I did and what she did for me, but I will fine wherever it takes.  I just wanted to share
My history here and get advices and tell people when you meet the wrong woman or the wrong man is really fucked up.
 
Planning to start a new life as well in a new country in Europe when all this pain goes away.  And then be able to get a dog and work towards the goals again.


That was my first time writing here and I am sorry for the long text, I tried to explain the
Maximum I could. Also to mention I used to be much more normal before giving my whole energy that even going in a market for food shopping or coffee places or something I used to do became like a hard task having p√¢nico attack because the place was too loud or busy. Therapy starts next week as well


Thank you, be careful out there all of you guys and girls. ",1,1735482624.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

Now, the shop is open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays selling single empanadas and empanadas by the dozen. The business also has a special that includes two empanadas, one drink, a bag of chips and a dipping sauce for $12.50.

 I JUST GOT EMAIL TODAY FROM PMI THAT I PASSED - T/AT/AT. 

Background: 
I resigned from my previous work  this year, June 2024 to fully prioritize and focus taking of my toddler who do not want her momma to work.üòÄ
 I am planning to find another job early next year when my toddler is a little bit bigger. I decided to pursue my PMP certification by end of this year while at home taking care of my baby.

Study Journey:
I started to review in September but not consistent at all. My toddler was so clingy and at the same time there were house chores, priorities that need to be done that drained my energy. During the night when I have time to review, my mind was already tired so I didn't absorb what i was reviewing. Time flies fast and November came, I was tempted to just schedule my PMP exam for next year since I felt like I was not ready to take it by end of this year (with so many Christmas celebrations). But I also don't want to prolong this PMP agony next year so this year is my hard deadline. 

I studied harder at midnights, 2 to 3 hours. I used AR's PMP Simplified Exam Prep Book along with his free 35 hours PMP prep course in TIA. After, I studied DM's Udemy PMP prep course in Udemy.  


I scheduled my exam on Dec 26 9AM online. One week before my exam, I bought the Study hall essentials. I just finished almost half of the practice exams due to limited time. I focused answering and studying all the mini exams - my scores were low ranging from 50 to 65, i felt bad and low. I reviewed my why my answers were wrong. 3 days before my exam, I took the SH 2 full length mock exam. Questions were so hard, it drains your brain. I got 69 and 73. 
Night before the exam, i felt nervous and didn't sleep well. I only had 2 hours of sleep.

Exam Day:
Woke up early, prepped by toddler's breaky and asked her dad to bring her to the playground. I took my breakfast and coffee, prepped my small snacks for  break time.  Check in was smooth. (I did 3√ó sytem test on my laptop prior to make sure there were no issues. I also prepped a back up laptop just in case there are laptop unknown issues on the exam day). 


The questions were bit shorter than SH mock. 60% Agile, Hybrid & 40% predictive. It was hard but manageable I think but also not confindent that I will pass. I was able to review my flagged answers and finished on time - 5 seconds left. 

Tips:

- Remember the Mindset during the exam. Very helpful indeed. I suggest before your exam, watch AR's YT video on Ultra hard PMP exam prep questions - the goal is to let the mindset sync in. Finish at least 50 questions.
- SH is very helpful to prep you for the exam. 

- Sometimes there are lots of distractions around us during prep/study.  Shake it off, refresh your determination and study harder.
PRAY when you feel down and nervous.

- For mommas like me who always multitask to take care of our children while doing house chores, work and planning to take PMP at the same time, It's hard but you can do it!!



Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to All of Us!!! Keep going and stay strong.üí™

1howzbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1howzbe/i_29m_messed_up_and_my_wife_28f_hasnt_spoken_to/,"I (29M) messed up, and my wife (28F) hasn‚Äôt spoken to me for three days. How do I fix this?","This post is a reupload because It was taken down. I edited a part that I have missed during the first upload.

TL;DR:

I procrastinated on chores, my wife got frustrated, and it escalated over a few days. Now she‚Äôs emotionally distant, and I‚Äôm not sure how to approach her or make things right.

The Full Story:

My wife is a stay-at-home wife, and I work full-time, twice a week from home. I‚Äôm not the type of guy who thinks just because I work and she doesn't, she should do everything else. I cook most of our meals, help with dishes, and do what I can around the house. But I‚Äôll admit ‚Äì I procrastinate, sometimes a lot, a personality trait I have been struggling with since my childhood.

A few days ago, she asked me to do the ironing on weekend since she was out with her family most of the weekdays that week. I said I‚Äôd do it later because I had to apply for new jobs. By the evening, I was mentally drained. She was tired too, and when she went to bed, I asked if I could do the ironing the next day. She said okay. But instead of resting, I played video games for a while.

The next day, she wanted to organize my room with me. I wasn‚Äôt into it, but I didn‚Äôt say anything. As we cleaned, we found a months-old, rotting piece of cake in my work bag in a place I never use. I remember getting that piece there few months ago but totally forgot about it. She got really upset and said, ‚ÄúWhenever you procrastinate, I have to deal with it.‚Äù

I tried to play it cool and lighten the mood, but she was clearly getting more annoyed. By nighttime, she softened, and we reconciled without actually talking about the issue. I know we should have talked when possible but we were both busy throughout the week. She had huge number of guest to visit her in a few days, I had a very busy week in my job and I was trying to find a new job in whatever free time I have.

Fast forward to few days later ‚Äì I had a packed schedule with meetings and job applications, but I still managed to make breakfast, cleanup the kitchen before she woke up. I then proceeded to work a little and joined a few meetings until I have to go to office to deliver a document. She had been cooking all day for her upcoming guests. When I was finally free and took the dog out around 6 PM, she said, ‚ÄúOh, now you walk the dog?‚Äù I told her I‚Äôd been swamped, and she just rolled her eyes. I walked the dog in previous night by the way, she does 2 walks a day 90% of the days.

Later, I tried to get close and help with dishes, but she exploded. She said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been four days! I forgave you without talking, but ever since we got married, I‚Äôm the one dealing with everything you put off! Set your priorities straight!‚Äù

I tried explaining that I thought walking the dog later was okay, but she stormed out. I have to add, walking the dog is not exclusively my responsibility, but whenever I am available I do it. I stayed home, cleaned the kitchen, and waited. She went to her friend‚Äôs place and didn‚Äôt return until late. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, so I tracked her location on Find My ( we share location ) and saw she was just sitting in the car for 15 minutes after getting home. When I went to check on her, she locked the doors and ignored me.

I waited outside in the cold for half an hour before giving up and waiting inside near the door. After she didn't come for 15 minutes, I went to check on her again. She eventually rushed past me, locked herself in her dressing room, and slept in a separate room.

The next morning, I had a full day workshop that I was a moderator of, I woke up early and rushed to work at 6 am. The guests were coming that day but I was not invited as it was a girls night. After leaving work at 6 pm, I just sit my car around the city until 1 am. When I went home, there were no guests and she appeared to be rushed to bed stopping whatever she was doing. I just went near her and kissed her. Proceeded to cleanup the rest of the house. When I was done, I went to bed but she was in bathroom. I was waiting for her but fell asleep. And when I woke up, she was not sleeping with me. She was sleeping in another room. I made her breakfast and a rose that I picked up when I was walking the dog. I left it by her side with a kiss, but she didn‚Äôt react. I made her coffee later and told her it was in the kitchen. She didn‚Äôt acknowledge me.

Since then, we haven‚Äôt spoken. She barely leaves her room, and I check in occasionally to see if she needs anything. I noticed she‚Äôs writing on her computer and hides the screen when I pass by.

I‚Äôm at a loss. I feel terrible, and I know this isn‚Äôt just about one rotting piece of cake or walking the dog. How do I fix this?",1,1735482179.0,relationshipadvice,2,0.67,False

A few weeks ago I've ordered some food grade silicone grease (it's safe and intended to be used on gaskets on coffee machines amongst others), removed the bayonet ring and greased up both sides of the screen (the silicone on the outside, not the metal part).

Yes, I still have to shove the portafilter pretty far in but I can now get consistently pressures around 8.5-9.5bar during extraction without leaks. Crema is pretty good as well. It will start to leak a bit beyond 10bar for me.

I'm not sure if there's some kind of local club or meeting that's going on but when I asked the clerk if they were going to make the sandwiches, they told me that they were already made and they sold them all at 5:30AM as soon as they came out of the oven.  And it doesn't look like they were making any kind of effort to produce more. 

PLEASE.. whoever is doing this.. for the love of your fellow man. Please place a catering order or go somewhere else and leave the convenience foods for those of us who just want a few minutes of joy!  LOL",5,1735481775.0,mildlyinfuriating,31,0.65,False

When I first came across the Znewtech timer, I was skeptical about how a simple device could transform my productivity. Having struggled with time management for years‚Äîoften losing track of hours while engrossed in work‚ÄîI felt like this timer was just another gadget in a long list of failed attempts to stay organized. Little did I know that this innovative timer would not only prove me wrong but also become a staple in my daily routine. Join me as we explore how this timer can revolutionize your approach to time management.

# Unboxing the Timer: First Impressions

# Design and Dimensions

The colors of the timer are also worth noting. I received the vibrant¬†**cyan**¬†model, a shade that adds a lovely splash of personality to my desk. However, it‚Äôs not just style over substance here. The dimensions of the timer are practical, measuring¬†`1.5""D x 4.75""W x 4.25""H`. This compact size makes it easy to place on any desk without being overly cumbersome.

# Let‚Äôs Talk Features

Now, let‚Äôs set some expectations when it comes to features. This timer comes with several handy presets:¬†**5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes.**¬†Whether you're counting down for a quick break, a focused work session, or time for power naps, it has you covered. It's a perfect tool for anyone looking to spice up their productivity.

>""This timer is a lifesaver for my studying habits! It‚Äôs surprising how having a physical timer helps me focus better than my phone did."" - Cassandra Bankson

This quote resonates well with my experience. The tactile feel of using a real timer, as opposed to tapping my phone, creates a different atmosphere of focus. It‚Äôs so easy to become distracted when our smartphones are involved, isn‚Äôt it? Having this physical timer allows us to put our phones aside and concentrate on the task at hand.

# Quick Look at the Data

|Rating|Sales Rank|
|:-|:-|
|4.5 out of 5 stars from 3008 reviews|\#40 in Timers on Amazon|

It‚Äôs impressive to see such a high rating from a solid number of reviews. In the world of timers, being ranked¬†**#40 on Amazon**¬†speaks volumes about its reliability and popularity.

This timer truly stands out‚Äînot just because of its aesthetic features, but also for its capability to help us be better managers of our time. I can see why it‚Äôs becoming a must-have tool for students and professionals alike!



# Understanding the Mechanics: How It Works

When it comes to managing our time effectively, simplicity is key. The¬†**Znewtech timer**¬†offers a straightforward yet engaging way to keep us on track. Here‚Äôs how it works:

# 1. Smart Presets for Efficient Time Management

This timer comes equipped with five preset timing options:¬†*5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes*. Each preset serves a different purpose. Need a quick break or a focused work session? Simply flip to the desired setting. These customizable sessions are perfect for techniques like¬†**Pomodoro**, where you work intently for short bursts. Many of us struggle with maintaining focus, right? A structured time limit can really help.

# 2. The Engaging Flipping Mechanism

One of the standout features is the¬†**flipping mechanism**. This design promotes an interactive experience. You literally¬†*turn*¬†the timer to start or stop it. I find it fascinating how a simple action can significantly enhance focus. Sometimes, the act of flipping feels almost like a small ritual, one that signals our brain to refocus.

# 3. Adjustable Volume Control

Another great aspect is the¬†**adjustable volume control**. Whether you're working in a busy office or at home in a quiet space, you can adapt the sound to your preference. It has three levels: high, low, and silent. This makes it practical for varied environments. Have you ever been distracted by an annoying alarm while trying to concentrate? This feature eliminates that hassle.

>""I appreciate the simplicity of the timer; just turn it, and it begins to work. A simple action that yields great focus!"" - Aiden

In my experience, the¬†**user-friendly interface**¬†of the Znewtech timer is a big plus. With no buttons to fiddle with, it minimizes distractions. Setting it up was incredibly easy, which I truly appreciated. The mechanics behind this timer are refreshingly straightforward, allowing for a seamless transition from session to session.

Overall, the mechanics of this timer not only promote effective time management but also create a more engaging experience. It‚Äôs practical, intuitive, and ultimately helps boost productivity in our hectic lives.



# Real-Life Applications: More Than Just a Timer

When it comes to managing our time effectively, the Znewtech timer proves to be more than just a countdown device. It‚Äôs a valuable tool that adapts to various aspects of our lives. Are you curious about how you can use it beyond simply timing dinner? Let‚Äôs dive in!

# 1. Using it for Work and Study Sessions

Staying focused during work or study sessions can be a challenge. Have you ever found yourself zoning out as you stare at the computer screen? I know I have. With the Znewtech timer, you can create structured time intervals. Simply set the timer for¬†**15, 30, or 60 minutes**, and dive deep into your tasks.

This method aligns with popular time management techniques, such as the Pomodoro Technique. You work in intervals, allowing for short breaks. As you flip the timer, it becomes motivating to beat the clock. Many users have reported feeling more accountable. As one reviewer shared,

>""I carry this timer from room to room; it helps keep me accountable and focused on tasks."" - RA



# 2. Integrating it into Household Tasks

Household chores can seem endless, right? But when you set a timer, everything changes. You can break down cleaning sessions into¬†**manageable chunks**. For instance, timed sessions can be about¬†*15 minutes for tidying up*¬†or¬†*30 minutes for meal prep*. The countdown encourages you to maintain energy and focus.

When you hear the timer beep, it signals time to wrap it up. This system helps in effectively managing household chores without losing track of time, blending productivity with simplicity.

# 3. Benefits for Those with ADHD or Time Blindness

Time blindness can make it incredibly fine to keep track of tasks, especially for those with ADHD. The Znewtech timer offers a visual and auditory feedback mechanism. When the timer is active, you can see and hear the countdown, providing¬†**external cues**¬†to manage time. It‚Äôs a great way to maintain awareness of how much time is actually passing.

Users report that flipping the timer to the preset they want significantly lowers the threshold for starting tasks. It almost creates a game out of task management, making it easier to dive right in.

# Adaptability Across Different Needs

This timer's versatility doesn't end here. It can adapt for¬†*napping*,¬†*focused study*, or even¬†*exercise sessions*. The design is user-friendly; you just rotate the timer to set your desired countdown. Its portability means you can bring it wherever you go‚Äîwork, home, or even the gym.

In short, the Znewtech timer can reshape how we think about time management in our everyday lives. Whether for work or household tasks, it proves that a simple tool can have a profound impact.



# User Reviews: What People Are Saying

In exploring the world of timers, user reviews shed light on real experiences. This timer has gathered feedback from many users, revealing both strengths and weaknesses.

# Strengths

* **Portability:**¬†Many users love how easy it is to carry this timer from room to room. One reviewer mentioned that they use it all day long.
* **Simple to Use:**¬†The design is clean and straightforward. You just flip to start the countdown.
* **Multi-functional:**¬†With preset options of 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, it suits various needs‚Äîwhether for studying or cooking.

# Weaknesses

* **Battery Life:**¬†A common critique is the timer‚Äôs energy consumption. One user lamented, ‚ÄúThe timer sound is annoying, but the actual counting down feature is superb!‚Äù Here, ‚Äúannoying‚Äù might refer to the power usage.
* **Size:**¬†Some find it larger than expected, making it less ideal for travel. It‚Äôs described as being about the size of a small coffee mug...

# Community Feedback

Browsing through reviews shared by other users, I was surprised by the shared experiences. Many praised its functionality, but some users highlighted minor drawbacks, like the power consumption. Yet, their testimonials reinforced my appreciation for this timer as a tool for effectively managing time.

For instance, a user stated: ‚ÄúI carry it with me from room to room to keep myself accountable and on task.‚Äù This simple observation showcases its practical design. However, another user felt frustrated with the timer eating batteries quickly, saying it often wouldn‚Äôt work when they needed it most. This duality in feedback illustrates how functional it is for some and less reliable for others.

Overall, the timer‚Äôs user-friendliness continues to shine through. As one reviewer wisely pointed out, it helps break the inertia in tasks with enforced deadlines. It‚Äôs all about your needs‚Äîwhile the portability and simplicity cater to many, the battery consumption might be a dealbreaker for others.

# In Summary

This timer provides an interesting mix of praise and critique. It perfectly showcases the balance between functionality and potential drawbacks, prompting us all to consider what we truly need in a time management tool.



# Batteries Included‚ÄîOr Not? The Power Behind the Timer

# Understanding Battery Requirements

When it comes to battery-operated devices, knowing what you need is crucial. The timer I purchased requires¬†**2 AAA batteries**, which are not included. This was a surprise for me at first. But, once I figured it out, I stocked up on AAA batteries. I learned from various user experiences that preparing ahead saves time, effort, and frustration. Have you ever been caught without batteries when you needed them most?

# The Reality of Battery Life

Here‚Äôs the kicker: the battery life varies. Depending on usage, the lifespan of the batteries can be drastically different. Some users reported that their batteries lasted only a few days, while others enjoyed weeks of functionality. It‚Äôs all about the usage patterns. I found this out through reading reviews and personal experience, and it‚Äôs essential to manage expectations.

|Usage|Lifespan|
|:-|:-|
|Light Usage|Up to several weeks|
|Moderate Usage|A few weeks|
|Heavy Usage|Only a few days|

# Tips for Keeping Powered Up

In my journey with this timer, I realized that consistently checking the battery life is essential. We often forget about these tiny power sources until it‚Äôs too late. I make it a habit to replace the batteries regularly, especially after heavy use. This keeps me from experiencing those pesky dead battery moments!

# User Feedback on Power Management

User reviews paint a mixed picture. Many find the timer effective and easy to use, while some lament about battery life. One user humorously noted,

>""Be sure to have extra batteries on hand, as I learned the hard way!"" - Kelly Lou

It certainly resonates with my experience of being unprepared.



Ultimately, it‚Äôs about \*setting expectations\* and staying prepared. I find that managing battery life leads to seamless use. Have you figured out the best way to keep your gadgets powered? It's always a learning process!



# Maximizing Your Timer Experience: Practical Tips

Timers are incredible tools for boosting productivity and managing time. But to truly unlock their potential, we need to set up our environment, create well-defined routines, and minimize distractions. Let's break down how to maximize our timer experience.

# 1. Setting Up Your Work Environment

Before we dive into using a timer, we must prepare our workspaces. An organized space can significantly influence our focus. Here‚Äôs how to optimize it:

* **Declutter your area:**¬†A messy desk can lead to a messy mind. Clear out everything you don't need.
* **Designate a timer spot:**¬†Keep your timer in a spot that is easily visible. This way, you'll be reminded of the time limits you've set.
* **Minimize digital distractions:**¬†Put your phone on silent or use apps that block notifications while you work.

# 2. Creating a Routine with Preset Times

Establishing a routine is critical. I often use preset times for various tasks, and here‚Äôs why:

* **Predictability boosts productivity:**¬†When I know what I‚Äôll be doing and when, I can focus better.
* **Adapt to your needs:**¬†Start small with 15-minute intervals. Gradually work up to longer sessions as you get accustomed.
* **Use the timer creatively:**¬†Employ it for tasks beyond work‚Äîlike personal chores or relaxation breaks.

Angela M once said,

>‚ÄúThis timer not only tracks my time but also helps in creating structured routines that have boosted my productivity significantly!‚Äù

This truly reflects how a well-used timer can bring order to our days.



# 3. Minimizing Distractions Using the Timer Effectively

Distractions are everywhere. But timers can help combat them. Here‚Äôs how:

* **Focus sessions:**¬†Set the timer for a specific period (like 25 minutes). When it rings, take a short break. This technique, often called the Pomodoro Technique, keeps distractions at bay.
* **Training your focus:**¬†Knowing there's a countdown can motivate you to stay on task since time is ticking away.

Every time I flip the timer to start it, I feel a rush of motivation. It‚Äôs like a signal to my brain‚Äîtime to get things done! To fully leverage the benefits of the Znewtech timer, I made routines that embraced its presets. This newfound structure not only increased my productivity but also my satisfaction with completing tasks.

Let‚Äôs embrace the power of timers and take control of our time management, one tick at a time!



# Conclusion: Is It Right for You?

In wrapping up my experience with the¬†**Znewtech timer**, I can confidently say that this little gadget has been a significant addition to my daily life. It‚Äôs more than just a timer; it‚Äôs a powerful tool for¬†*time management*. Imagine having something that gently nudges you to stay focused while managing to be visually appealing. That‚Äôs what this timer offers!

Let‚Äôs summarize its usefulness. The timer is designed with easy-to-use presets, allowing you to set 5, 15, 30, 45, or even 60-minute countdowns. Just turn the timer to your desired setting, and it starts counting down immediately. No fiddling with buttons, no distractions from phones or notifications. Just pure focus. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how this simplicity has helped me maintain my productivity throughout the day.

Reflecting on my journey with this timer, I began using it during short breaks to manage ADHD and procrastination struggles. Initially, I thought it would be just another gadget that collects dust. Surprisingly, it became my go-to assistant. There are days when I feel overwhelmed by tasks, but seeing that timer countdown gives me the motivation to push through. When I saw how much it helped with my time blindness, I knew it was here to stay.

Have you ever found yourself lost in a task, only to realize hours have slipped away? We all have! This timer turns that chaos into manageable chunks. I‚Äôve even started using the 45-minute preset for power naps, which helps reset my energy effectively.

Now, I encourage you all to give this timer a try. Whether you‚Äôre battling distractions or just need an extra push towards productivity, this timer could be what you need. As one happy user described,

>""In a world full of distractions, having a reliable timer like this has been a game changer!"" - RA

Last year, there were 300,000 foreign tourists in Troms√∏, and this may increase by another 150,000.

Good and fine, or is it?

How has this development affected those of us who live here?

300,000 tourists in the streets means 300,000 cameras in the streets, and in recent years I have increasingly felt like I‚Äôm on display in my own city, in my own life.

Every time I take out my kicksled to get to work or pick up my kids from kindergarten, I quietly ask myself if I can bear it.

I am always photographed.

I‚Äôve stopped dressing my children in Sami shawls when we go downtown.

They are always photographed.

Last week, after dropping off the kids at school and kindergarten, I had to shovel snow outside the house‚Äîit had come down heavily. I was wearing old sweatpants, a shabby down jacket, and a random hat. It was around eight in the morning. It was hard work, and I hadn‚Äôt had my first coffee yet. I was groggy, tired from the dark season, and sweating.

On top of that, I had two Spanish tourists standing there filming me.

One day last year, a relative was almost hit by a car driven by three Asian tourists downtown. They had never driven on icy roads before.

This happens weekly: a group of tourists stands in the middle of the highway taking selfies‚Äîright in the road! Putting themselves and others in danger for the sake of pictures. Blocking traffic.

A friend of mine and her family struggled to find a rental home‚Äîthere were hardly any available because everything had been converted into Airbnbs. At a viewing for a simple apartment, there were 40 to 50 desperate people. It took them months of intense searching to find a place to live for themselves and their three children.

My youngest daughter has always loved buying hot dogs from the Rakettkiosken downtown. We can‚Äôt do that anymore because there‚Äôs a line of 50 people. She‚Äôs gotten used to it now and has stopped asking. The Rakettkiosken isn‚Äôt ours anymore.

The stores around us have put up garish lights and changed their names. They all have something to do with ""explorer,"" ""adventure,"" or ""Arctic."" And they all sell the same things: trinkets, trolls, and Sami flags. Downtown now has nearly a hundred souvenir shops and tour operators.

But not a single toy store.

This fall, I was yelled at by an American tourist in Storgata because I was wearing a Palestinian scarf.

One day not long ago, I snapped. I was pulling my kids on a sled when two tourists started taking pictures of us. I thought: How many Troms√∏ children appear on foreign Instagram accounts without permission? I confronted them and said they needed to understand they couldn‚Äôt take photos without asking first.

They were genuinely upset. They spoke in a language I didn‚Äôt understand, but I could tell they felt sorry.

There‚Äôs no malice in people, so why does it happen?

What kind of information do tourists receive when they come here? Do they know anything about the city they‚Äôre visiting, other than that it has a purple light hanging over it?

What if they got a bit more information?

What if they were told that in Troms√∏, as in Norway, the Convention on the Rights of the Child applies, and it‚Äôs not allowed to photograph other people‚Äôs children? That it‚Äôs not just about manners but about children‚Äôs rights?

Are they discouraged from renting a car if they have no experience driving on icy or winter roads?

Are they told that Troms√∏ is a sister city to Gaza and that it‚Äôs very likely they‚Äôll meet someone wearing a Palestinian scarf?

Whose responsibility is it to communicate the obvious: that you can‚Äôt climb onto people‚Äôs verandas, take pictures into their living rooms, or relieve yourself in their gardens?

Or are these consequences we must tolerate if we want tourism‚Äîthe same poor behavior that other tourist destinations, cities, and countries have endured for years?

I can‚Äôt remember‚Äîhave we, the residents of Troms√∏, had a say in this extreme push for tourism? We, who have to live with the consequences?

I‚Äôm not happy with tourism.

It has diminished my quality of life, forced me to change my way of living. Things that have always been important to my Northern Norwegian identity are now put aside, literally. My kicksled stands unused, and the Sami shawls hang on their hooks at home.

I am genuinely afraid it will reach a point where I‚Äôm no longer comfortable being out at all‚Äîin my own city.",10,1735481724.0,tromsotravel,1,1.0,False
1howsqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1howsqp/breville_barista_touch_1249_cad_vs_delonghi_la/,Breville Barista Touch [$1249 CAD] vs. Delonghi La Specialista Opera [$899],"We‚Äôre upgrading our espresso machine (from the Delonghi Dedica) and I‚Äôve narrowed it down to either the Breville Barista Touch or the Delonghi La Specialista Opera. At first, the Breville seemed like the obvious choice but I find myself torn between the two based on the negative reviews on it (quite a few people reporting the same error code, steam wand issues, etc). The Delonghi has less negative reviews, but less reviews in general. I‚Äôd love any insights and recommendations. 

Some factors for us:

- we want some automation. We have another baby coming and recognize that we don‚Äôt want to spend that much of our limited free time tinkering with espresso beverages. However, we‚Äôre not interested in going the super automatic route.

- we‚Äôre not coffee snobs. We‚Äôve been generally satisfied with our basic Delonghi Dedica, but want more consistency in quality of espresso shots, steam wand, and overall beverage temperature. 

- the Breville is at the top of our budget and the most we‚Äôre willing to spend. 


I also realize that each of these machines assist with different parts of the beverage-making process. I‚Äôm indifferent to which parts we automate and just want some overall improvement in the time it takes to make the beverage.

 Any suggestions or models that we should consider? Overall, we just need some steps in the process to be quicker and don‚Äôt want to compromise quality or have a machine that‚Äôs going to cause us trouble within a year or two. We‚Äôre also in Canada, so that may impact availability.

I hope all is well in your life.[ I discuss these ideas over a cup of coffee this morning if you prefer to engage via audio/video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGIV_0ViGso)

If you want the short 45 second blurp, [here it is](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CW0Jd-Kcnd0).

In this post, I want to introduce an idea I call ""the circle of deception"" and how it shows up due to the way the Christian system is wired.

I do not know what this idea is officially called, so if a source can be shown with this idea called ""the circle of deception"" ill gladly hand it off. But for now that is what I am calling it. However, I am confident this idea has came up in conversation before.

Okay, so here goes.

If you are a Christian, AND Satan is actively deceiving people, you can never be certain of your salvation.

Before we start getting bent out of shape over this claim, just follow me here for a second.

What does a perfect deception look like?

Well, I think Jesus sums it up quite nice here on the Sermon on the Mount:

[***A Tree and its Fruit***](https://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/7.htm)  
‚Ä¶**21**Not everyone who says to Me, ‚ÄòLord, Lord,‚Äô will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven.¬†**22**[Many](https://biblehub.com/greek/4183.htm)¬†[will say](https://biblehub.com/greek/2046.htm)¬†[to Me](https://biblehub.com/greek/1473.htm)¬†[on](https://biblehub.com/greek/1722.htm)¬†[that](https://biblehub.com/greek/1565.htm)¬†[day,](https://biblehub.com/greek/2250.htm)¬†[‚ÄòLord,](https://biblehub.com/greek/2962.htm)¬†[Lord,](https://biblehub.com/greek/2962.htm)¬†[did we not prophesy](https://biblehub.com/greek/4395.htm)¬†[in](https://biblehub.com/greek/3588.htm)¬†[Your](https://biblehub.com/greek/4674.htm)¬†[name,](https://biblehub.com/greek/3686.htm)¬†[and](https://biblehub.com/greek/2532.htm)¬†[in](https://biblehub.com/greek/3588.htm)¬†[Your](https://biblehub.com/greek/4674.htm)¬†[name](https://biblehub.com/greek/3686.htm)¬†[drive out](https://biblehub.com/greek/1544.htm)¬†[demons](https://biblehub.com/greek/1140.htm)¬†[and](https://biblehub.com/greek/2532.htm)¬†[perform](https://biblehub.com/greek/4160.htm)¬†[many](https://biblehub.com/greek/4183.htm)¬†[miracles?‚Äô](https://biblehub.com/greek/1411.htm)¬†**23**Then I will tell them plainly, ‚ÄòI never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!‚Äô‚Ä¶

So, we see a certain type of person who believes they are right in God's eyes, but ended up not being right after death.

And we ask ourselves the question, ""Are we such people""

The problem is we can never validate or invalidate this feeling. This is only inflamed by the idea that a monstrous master liar who is on the prowl devouring souls on the daily.

So, this creates a situation where people never feel comfortable in their own skin because they can never truly be certain if they are saved. They can never be certain because a perfect deception would be just that: you feeling like everything is okay.

The amount of anxiety and heartache this has caused me in my own life is tremendous.

I feel it is wrong to tell someone they are being hunted if we cannot demonstrate such a claim.

In October realized my voucher expires in February 2025 and scheduled exam for today 5am. Went to bed early while reading the first 4 chapters of the All-in-One book again to get into the ISACA mindset. Awoke at 4am, showered, dressed, had breakfast and coffee. Was fully engaged with the questions and possible answers which i found to be more straightforward than the QAE.
