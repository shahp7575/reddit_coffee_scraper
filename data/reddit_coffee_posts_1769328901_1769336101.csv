I force it to interview me first by following the “Ask Me Questions” link.,"But I realized that it’s usually the fault of me if ChatGPT answers me with a generic boring answer. I told it to write a marketing plan for my coffee shop. It gave me a generic strategy that could be applied to any coffee shop.

I stopped trying to give all the details out loud. I mute it.

The ""Interviewer"" Protocol:

Instead of dumping information I ask the AI to tell me what it needs.

The Prompt:

My Goal: To write a [Viral Twitter Thread about AI] . The constraint is that it is not already generated. 

Task: Ask me 5 specific questions about my audience, tone, and unique angle. 

Action: Wait for my answers. Then, and only then, make the content based on my inputs.

Why this wins:

It takes form with the name of Hyper-Personalization.

The AI asks questions I had no idea existed: “Are you targeting beginners or experts?” or “Do you want a controversial hook or one for educational purposes” . I would say that my final output is 10x better because it fits my constraints rather than a template.",1,1769336020.0,AI_Tips_Tricks,0,1.0,False

To make a hugely long story short, she has been through a lot of crap in that time, however she has also caused a LOT of drama in both her and her husband's families. I have also been on the receiving end of her angry outbursts a few times, but pushed things aside because - as she is aware - I have major trauma with conflict, as well as anxiety issues.


Recently, she accused me of something I didn't do, and then ignored me when I tried to tell her the truth and I even apologised when i had done nothing wrong. She ignored me for a whole month. 

Yesterday, she asked me if I want to meet for coffee. I assume its to discuss things, but I am so anxious, I cant possibly be strong enough to see her face to face.  


I want to end the friendship. The thing is, if it wasn't for the fact that I see her regularly in my place of work, I would just cut her off and leave it at that. However I fear that because when I'm with her, I become just like her - a bitchy gossipy person - and so I fear that she has 'ammo' that could cause me to lose my job or other friendships. I am so scared. I want to end it. But how can I do it? It will be 4 days before I see her again.. do I ignore her request to catch up? Or do I send a ""this is over"" text?

1qmf81g,https://i.redd.it/y8w31y18wgfg1.png,[Update Drop] ControlUp Stable Release [v1.0.3],"Good tidings r/playnite crew 👋

I am happy to inform y'all that ControlUp is no longer experimental! 

I had no idea that a lot of people really wanted a feature like this for Playnite. While I'm waiting for an upcoming Playnite update to simplify this add-on further, I'm happy enough with the improvements I've made since the last Reddit thread that I feel good to call it stable and releasable to the Playnite community.

Available on both Github and on Playnite's official add-on database (see setup instructions below).

# About

ControlUp is a Playnite add-on that **detects game controller connections and recognizes gamepad hotkeys**, enabling users to automatically or manually switch from Desktop Mode to Fullscreen mode.

**What's New in v1.0.3:**

* **Simplified Detection/Trigger Modes** \- New Connection Only (*RECOMMENDED FOR BEST EXPERIENCE*), Any Controller Anytime, or Startup Only.
* **Long Press Hotkey Support & Delay Customization** \- Hold instead of tap for single-button hotkeys and customize how long to hold your buttons before actions are triggered.
* **Expanded Hotkey Options** \- Lots more button combos: Guide+Start, LB+RB combos, single buttons, etc.
* **PlayStation Controller Support** \- Enhanced DualSense/DualShock detection via SDL
* **Fixed Fullscreen Switching Bhavior** \- No more amateur ""Send F11 shortcut to initiate Fullscreen"" behavior! Playnite's Fullscreen.exe is launched directly when you initiate a switch.

**Key Features**

**Controller Support**

* XInput-compatible controllers
* DirectInput-compatible controllers (through SDL lbrary)

**Hotkey Support**

* 10+ button combinations or single buttons with long press
* Skip popup option for direct fullscreen switching
* Polling interval control

🎨 **Pop-Up Customization**

* 7 screen positions, acrylic blur effects
* Colors, borders, timing - blend it with your current theme
* Live preview before saving

📦 **Installation**

**Navigate the Playnite Add-on database to install ControlUp** OR **Download ControlUp v1.0.3:** [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aHuddini/ControlUp/releases)

**Setup:**

1. Connect your controller to your PC
2. Configure your preferred trigger methods in Add-on Settings → Installed \[Generic\] → ControlUp

**Credits:** Special thanks to the SDL team for their controller detection/input mapping libraries. u/Amazing_Emergency_69 for their feedback/thorough testing, and u/Crow for awesome developer support!

I've been looking to replace my (t)rusty Silvia with something (don't even get me started, 6 year old v6 and the stainless steel frame already started rusting, despite me wiping it off... I've seen similar issues all over the internet...).

Honestly, if I had the money, I'd buy a Decent Bengle, because what fascinates me is the programmability and repeatability. I'm a computer scientist and nerding out like that is appealing to me. On the other hand I have been itching to try out a lever machine, too. I know the Met can't temp profile, it's a tradeoff I'm okay with given it costs half the Decent. 

I drink light roast coffee, usually filter in the morning and straight espresso in the afternoon. My wife likes milk drinks - I understand if I get the Met I'll have to get something like a Morning Dream or a Flair Wizard or use some cheapo frother and wait for the Met Milk. 

I use a Philos for grinding. Was also an early adopter there and I didn't regret getting it. 

I really don't need a dual boiler for my usage either if I'm being honest. Perfectly happy with steaming on a single boiler. 

I think I could just about stomach the 2000€ plus whatever I'll do for milk, they don't sell Decent machines used around where I live, and even a DE1 costs like 4000€ I think which is way out of my comfort zone.

Other things I have considered:

\- Decent: out of the price range

\- Argos Odyssey: dunno about support given it's US-based plus I like the geekiness/repeatability in the likes of the Decent/Met

\- Flair I was also on the fence about, would prefer the repeatability of an automated system

\- Fellow ES1 - dislike the cheapo build quality and lack of repairability, others have been disappointed in easier-to-make Fellow products and you can hear simple things like a kettle being broken after a year of usage

\- Wendougee Lita/Data - these I just find plain ugly, plus they measure pressure at the pump, not flow, also I really don't need a dual boiler

• Airport rules changed — Heathrow has scrapped the 100 ml liquid rule. You can now carry up to 2 L of liquids when flying from Heathrow, but most other airports still enforce 100 ml limits.

• Garden waste registration open — Harrow Council garden waste collections are back, with prices frozen at £69. Sign up by 13 March to start service in April.

• Housing licensing consultation — The Council is consulting on renewing the Additional HMO Licensing Scheme affecting shared homes. Have your say before 27 February.

• Don’t forget to register to vote — If you’re applying for postal vote for the May elections, reapply by 31 January.

• Local business news — SoloGreen has launched nearby with solar PV, heat pumps and EV chargers; and there’s a new “Letting Agreed” sign up on the old Costa Coffee site.

• Transport update — TfL reports good service on relevant lines expected through the week.

• Dog of the Week — Meet Babs — energetic, joyful and celebrating her birthday this week.

I put together the full local roundup in this week’s Good Morning Pinner newsletter, with more details and events.

My initial thoughts at Hanoi airport were I’d made a huge mistake as while waiting for my grab a few guys tried to get me to go with them instead by saying they were my grab driver, showing fake Grab ID, one tried to take my phone from my hand, my grab driver then told me to cancel twice (I assume to get the fee, I had no choice). 

Eventually after a few days in Hanoi I have fallen in love with the city. It is now one of my favourite places I’ve travelled. Every street is a picture. The food is great and I’ve met some great people. Egg coffee is amazing! 

I cannot wait to come back to 🇻🇳 and see more of this beautiful country. ",4,1769335077.0,hanoi,0,1.0,False

Everything’s normal until the guy in front of me—barefoot, confident, unbothered—puts a full rotisserie chicken directly into a gray bin. No bag. No foil. Just vibes.

The TSA agent freezes. The X-ray monitor beeps like it’s offended.

“Sir… is that a chicken?”

The guy nods. “Emotional support.”

They pull him aside. Another agent shows up. Then another. Now there are four TSA agents in a huddle, whispering like they’re defusing a bomb made of poultry. One of them swabs the chicken for explosives. The chicken fails, but like… aggressively.

Meanwhile, the line stops moving. A woman behind me is crying because her shampoo is 3.4 ounces and “she’s already lost so much.” A kid two lanes over is chanting “LET THE CHICKEN FLY.”

Then TSA calls a supervisor. This guy walks over like he’s seen wars. He looks at the chicken, looks at the man, and says, dead serious:

“Sir. Are you planning to consume this chicken before or after the flight?”

The man says, “Depends how security goes.”

That answer buys him nothing.

They confiscate the chicken. The man salutes it as it’s taken away. One agent whispers, “Thank you for your service,” and I’m not convinced I imagined that.",2,1769334979.0,tsa,2,0.56,False

I’ve bootstrapped a startup, taught tech to thousands, and now split my time between campus case discussions, weightroom therapy, and discovering new filter coffee spots. My happy weekends are bookstores, board games, indie films, street food, and long walks where the conversation wanders further than we do. Values: empathy over ego, growth over gossip, craft over clout.

Seeking: an intellectually curious woman (21+), emotionally literate, open to slow-burn connection. Someone who lights up at a great question, a surprising insight, or a beautifully argued essay. Bonus if you enjoy museums, flea markets, quizzes, midnight desserts, or debating whether cities should be designed for cars or children.

What we can do: chai and a stroll through a bookshop; swap our top five life-changing reads; co-create a tiny fun project; or simply sit on a quiet bench and talk about the thing you can’t stop thinking about this week—economics, cinema, sport, design, psychology, poetry, cricket, F1—your pick.

Boundaries: safety first; no pressure to escalate; consent is culture; kindness is non-negotiable.

If any of this resonates, send a thoughtful opener: your city, a recent idea that shook you, and a niche hill you’d die on. I’ll go first—mine change often, but right now: “Speed is a habit; depth is a practice.” I reply best to messages with curiosity, clarity, and a little wonder.

Let’s trade questions, not résumés. If we vibe, coffee’s on me.

1. Late for things

2. Lose things and misplace them, dont' know where they are.

3. Racing thoughts about what other people are thinking and feeling insecure.

4. When lucid I realize I've been having a mask for my whole life, it feels like I have a filter and insecure about things and can finally connect to others for about 5 days after maybe cold plunge out other lucid meditation.

5. Ruminating thoughts about my crush/girls I like constantly, feeling ""obsessed"" I just realize while typing this that's probably why I have a mask, I don't know when my ruminating thoughts are taking over so I make sure to put on a mask to be normal.

6. Lack of feeling ""present"" amongst people.

Here's some big ones too:

7. I have a nice home, but always and only do work or do ""tasks"" on my computer at a Coffee Shop.

8. Coffee calms me down.

Mostly I feel from my own perspective I am a very socially intelligent and fun person. But I have these outbursts of energy and do not like to sleep. I find it hard to connect to people in calm talks without overthinking constantly while talking. Worried about what others might feel about me. I guess I probably have some internal struggles of confidence + ADHD exacerbates it.

I don't remember how many times I've lost my jacket, when I was in 5th grade I left my flute in the playground and someone stole it. I leave things.

All in all I don't think my ADHD affects me to the point I am debilitating, as I feel I have a successful life, although my social dynamics, I feel like it's getting in the way of me finding someone for a long term relationship due to me not being able to open up or connect to others in a healthy way as I find i difficult.",1,1769333746.0,ADHDers,0,1.0,False

I spent years writing this book (50 pages) word by word, sharing my honest journey with confidence, body image, and feeling stuck.

I truly believe that if you really understand my book, it can free you — free you from self-doubt, from feeling trapped, from being stuck in your own body and mind.

Chapter 1 

Elaina Carroll gripped the cold porcelain of the toilet bowl, her knuckles turning white as another wave of nausea rolled through her empty stomach. The fluorescent lights of the office restroom hummed overhead, a sound that seemed to drill directly into her skull. She squeezed her eyes shut, forcing herself to breathe through her nose, counting the seconds until the spinning sensation in her head slowed down.

One. Two. Three.

It had been six weeks since the charity gala. Six weeks since the ch\*\*pagne that tasted like liquid gold and the mistake that felt like a fever dream.

With trembling fingers, she reached into her pocket and pulled out the white plastic stick she had smuggled in inside her sleeve. She didn't want to look. Looking made it real. But the silence of the stall was suffocating, and the unknown was worse than the truth.

She opened her eyes.

Two pink lines.

They were faint, but they were undeniable. A positive result.

The air left her lungs in a sharp, ragged g\*\*p. Her hand flew to her mouth to stifle a sob, but a small, pathetic whimper escaped. Memories of that night flashed behind her eyelids-the heavy scent of pine and expensive scotch, the rough texture of Adrian Conway's tuxedo jacket, the way his eyes had darkened in the dim light of the hotel suite. It wasn't love. It wasn't even romance. It was a collision of al\*\*hol and opportunity, a lapse in judgment from a man who never made mistakes and a woman who was too dazzled to say no.

The restroom door swung open with a heavy thud, followed by the sharp, rhythmic click of high heels on the tiled floor.

Elaina panicked. She shoved the pr\*\*nancy test deep into her handbag, burying it under receipts and lip balm. She flushed the toilet, not because she needed to, but to mask the sound of her jagged breathing.

""Elaina? Are you dead in there?""

The voice was sharp, laced with faux concern. Joni Dillon. Of course, it was Joni.

Elaina stood up, smoothing down her skirt with shaking hands. She took a deep breath, composed her face into a mask of neutrality, and unlocked the stall door.

Joni was standing at the sinks, reapplying a shade of lipstick that was too bright for a Tuesday morning. She caught Elaina's reflection in the mirror and smirked.

""You look like h\*\*l,"" Joni said, popping her lips. ""Rough night? Or just hungover?""

Elaina moved to the adjacent sink, turning on the tap. The water was freezing, shocking her skin. She splashed it onto her face, desperate to wash away the heat rising in her cheeks.

""Just a stomach bug,"" Elaina muttered, grabbing a paper towel. ""I'm fine.""

""Right,"" Joni drawled, her eyes narrowing as she watched Elaina dry her face. ""Well, you better get it together. The Ice King is on a rampage today. He's already fired two interns for breathing too loud.""

Elaina didn't respond. She threw the paper towel in the bin and walked out, her legs feeling like lead.

Her desk was right outside the double mahogany doors of the CEO's office. It was a gatekeeper's station, organized with military precision. She sat down, her hand instinctively going to her flat stomach beneath the fabric of her blouse. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic rhythm that made her dizzy.

She was going to lose her job. That was the only outcome. Adrian Conway didn't do messy. He didn't do personal complications. He was a machine, efficient and cold, and she was just a cog that had suddenly malfunctioned.

The intercom on her desk buzzed, making her jump.

""Coffee. Black.""

Adrian's voice was low, devoid of inflection. It wasn't a request; it was a command.

Elaina's body moved on autopilot. Five years of being his Executive Assistant had wired her muscles to respond to his voice before her brain could catch up. She went to the breakroom, her hands performing the ritual-fresh grind, French press, four minutes exactly. No sugar. No cream. Just bitter, dark liquid.

She stood outside his office door with the steaming mug, taking a moment to steady herself. She had to tell him. She couldn't keep this a secret, not when her body was already betraying her.

She pushed the door open.

Adrian Conway was standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, his back to her. He was on the phone, his posture rigid, the line of his shoulders sharp under his bespoke suit. The city of Manhattan sprawled out beneath him, gray and imposing, much like the man himself.

He turned as she entered, his eyes scanning her with the indifference one might show a piece of furniture. He pointed to the coaster on his desk, not breaking his conversation.

Elaina set the mug down. The ceramic clinked softly against the glass surface. She didn't leave. She stood there, gripping the edge of her blazer, her fingernails digging into her palms.

Adrian hung up the phone and looked at her, his brow furrowing slightly. ""Is there a problem, Elaina?""

""Mr. Conway,"" she started, her voice sounding thin and foreign to her own ears. ""About... about that night. The gala.""

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees. Adrian's expression hardened. He picked up a file from his desk, not looking at her.

""That was a mistake, Elaina. A lapse. We agreed to forget it.""

""I know,"" she whispered. ""But-""

""I don't repeat myself,"" he cut her off, his tone slicing through the air like a scalpel. ""You are an excellent assistant. Do not make me question your professionalism by bringing up irrelevancies. Go.""

The shame hit her like a physical blow. It started in her ch\*\*t and burned its way up her throat. He saw it as nothing. A blip. An irrelevancy.

""I'm sorry,"" she choked out.

She turned and fled. She walked fast, head down, past Joni's curious gaze, past the murmuring interns. She needed air. She needed to get out of this building before she shattered.

It was lunch hour. She grabbed her purse and headed for the elevators, intending to go to the clinic three blocks away to get a bl\*\*d test confirmation, just to be absolutely, one hundred percent sure before her world ended.

The elevator doors pinged open on the executive floor. Elaina stepped forward, but stopped abruptly.

Constance Conway was inside.

The matriarch of the Conway family was a woman made of steel and pearls. She was petite, but her presence filled the small metal box, su\*\*ing out all the oxygen. Her gray hair was coiffed into an immobile helmet, and her eyes were the same icy blue as her son's.

""Good afternoon, Mrs. Conway,"" Elaina managed to say, stepping in and pressing herself against the side wall.

Constance didn't answer immediately. Her gaze swept over Elaina, assessing, calculating. It felt like being scanned by a predator.

""Miss Carroll,"" Constance finally acknowledged, her voice dry.

The elevator descended in silence. Elaina stared at the floor numbers changing, willing them to move faster. Her stomach churned again. The smell of Constance's heavy, floral perfume was making her gag reflex twitch.

The doors opened to the lobby. Elaina practically bolted out, eager for the exit.

A courier with a stack of boxes was rushing in, blind behind his load. He slammed into Elaina's shoulder.

The impact spun her around. Her handbag slipped from her grasp and hit the marble floor upside down.

Everything spilled. Her wallet, her keys, her lipstick.

And the box. The white box with the bold pink lettering. PREGNANCY TEST.

Elaina gasped and dropped to her knees, her hands scrambling to gather her things. She snatched up the wallet, the keys. She reached for the box.

But a manicured hand with a large sapphire ring got there first.

Elaina froze. She looked up, her breath hitching in her throat.

Constance Conway was holding the box. She turned it over in her hand, reading the label. Then, her eyes moved to the loose plastic stick that had fallen out of the box, lying on the floor. The two pink lines were visible even from this distance.

Constance picked up the stick with two fingers, as if it were contaminated evidence. She looked at the date on the receipt that had fluttered out. She looked at Elaina.

There was no anger in her face. There was something far worse. A slow, terrifying smile spread across her lips.

""Get up,"" Constance said softly.

Elaina stood, her legs shaking so hard she thought they might give out. ""Mrs. Conway, I can explain-""

Constance raised a hand, silencing her. She snapped her fingers, and two large men in dark suits materialized from the shadows of the lobby.

""My car is outside,"" Constance said. ""Get in.""

""I... I can't,"" Elaina stammered, looking toward the revolving doors where freedom lay. ""I have to get back to work.""

""You have a new job now,"" Constance said, her voice leaving no room for argument. She turned and walked toward the exit, the men flanking Elaina, blocking any path of escape.

Elaina looked around the busy lobby. People were walking by, checking their phones, drinking coffee. No one noticed the kidnapping happening in plain sight.

She was ushered through the doors and toward a sleek black Lincoln stretched out at the curb. The driver held the door open.

Elaina hesitated, looking back at the glass tower of Conway Enterprises. High up on the top floor, Adrian was drinking his black coffee, completely unaware that his life-and hers-was about to implode.

One of the bodyguards placed a hand on her back and shoved, not gently. Elaina stumbled into the dark interior of the car. The door slammed shut, sealing her in with the dragon.",1,1769333629.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

In the airport lounge.

Nina Collins was bored, scrolling through her phone. Suddenly, she saw a title: ""What have you willingly done for an ex you can't forget?""

Nina was a little curious and tapped on it. The video was pitch black, but when she heard the familiar voice, she froze.

""My ex was really into her looks and wanted a nose job,"" the man chuckled, as if remembering something fond. ""But she was scared of the pain, so it ended up using my rib.""

The others in the video started teasing, ""What's that saying again? The woman you love is the rib taken from your own body. Looks like our Sean Miller was really in love with his ex.""

The man chuckled and didn't deny it.

Hearing the name Sean, Nina's pupils contracted slightly. She was almost certain the man in the video was her fiancé.

Sean's voice continued, and Nina hold her breath.

""She was spoiled and wouldn't do anything. I even had to put her socks on for her.""

""Oh, and when we broke up, she threatened to kill herself unless I found someone else. Said I'd stay single waiting for her otherwise.""

The guys burst out laughing, teasing him, ""So you don't have any feelings for Nina at all?""

Hearing her own name, Nina clenched her fists, her palms growing damp with sweat.

""Just a plaything. How could it be serious?""

The words shattered her last shred of hope.

Nina felt like she'd been plunged into an icy abyss, a chill spreading up from her feet, her mind a complete blank.

The guys laughed again, ""Sean, I'm totally posting this video online.""

Sean said coldly, ""Whatever.""

""Whoa, aren't you afraid your fiancée will see it and cause a scene?""

""She's just a plaything. I've had my fun with her for years, that's enough. My girl is back, and I can't let her get hurt.""

Three years together, and she was just a plaything!

Her heart felt like it had been pierced by a sharp blade, the pain so intense Nina could barely breathe.

She slowly squatted down, wrapping her arms tightly around herself, trying to find some comfort.

In the noisy, bustling lounge, Nina looked completely out of place squatting on the floor.

A little girl saw her on the floor and hurried over to help her up, her voice soft. ""Do you have low blood sugar? I have some candy.""

But when Nina looked up, her pretty face was covered in tears, and she looked completely devastated.

The sweet-faced little girl was taken aback, her voice faltering, ""Why are you crying?""

Nina shook her head, lacking the energy to respond.

The little girl glanced at her, pried open her hand, and placed a piece of candy in her palm. ""Eating candy will make you feel better.""

With that, the little girl left.

Nina tremblingly put the candy in her mouth, but she didn't taste any sweetness, only a lingering bitterness.

Hearing the boarding call, she slowly walked onto the plane. As she sat in her seat, Nina's tears kept falling, blurring her vision.

In a daze, she remembered the first time she saw Sean.

Nina had once suffered from severe depression due to family issues, and had serious suicide tendencies.

She'd been to the rooftop several times. The last time, she spotted a tall man in the corner. His face was hidden in the dark—impossible to see clearly.

When he saw her foot step onto the rooftop edge, he cursed under his breath. ""Fuck!""

Just as Nina was about to close her eyes and jump, she was grabbed from behind by the waist and pulled back.

This time, Nina got a clear look at the man.

He had beautiful, alluring eyes and a sharp jawline, though his gaze was nonchalant. His tightly pressed lips revealed his displeasure, and he carried the faint scent of alcohol.

""You got a death wish?"" The man's tone was awful, and he looked at Nina like she was crazy.

But Nina suddenly smiled, a smile so bright and bold that it felt like a ripple spreading through her otherwise calm heart.

Suddenly, Nina didn't want to die anymore.

She looked at the tall, handsome man before her, held out her hand, and said, ""I'm Nina. Want to date?""

The man glanced at her with interest, his eyes seemingly looking through her at someone else. ""Sure.""

And just like that, the two who had only met once became inseparable lovers.

After they fell in love, Sean took Nina to see a therapist countless times, carefully tended to her emotional needs, and gradually helped her become a cheerful person.

If Nina mentioned offhand in the middle of the night that she wanted tortellini, he would drive across half the city to buy her favorite kind.

When Nina would wake up in the middle of the night, crying and feeling insecure, he would pull her into a tight embrace, staying awake all night just to comfort her.

She once believed that Sean loved her, just as she loved him.

But everything now told her that the past was nothing but a dream.

A dream that shatters at a touch and can't be put back together.

She wiped away her tears, found the number, and dialed it before the plane took off.

""I agree to go back for the arranged marriage.""

Chapter 2

Nina was the illegitimate daughter of the Collins family in Los Angeles.

Her mother, Laura Collins, was the first love of the head of Collins family. He was later forced by his family to marry a lady of well-matched social status, but Laura was already pregnant at the time.

Before she died, Laura entrusted her to the head of the Collins family. She still remembered the shock and insecurity she felt the first time she saw the Collins' home.

The Collins' home was like a palace that had trapped her mother, and now it had trapped her too.

Nina wasn't liked by the Collins family. Even the servants could call her the illegitimate daughter. Jessica Collins, Mrs. Collins's daughter, had enjoyed bullying her since they were kids.

Later, to prevent Jessica from an arranged marriage, David Collins forced her to marry the extremely ugly Mr. Bronner.

Looking at the WhatsApp contact David pushed toward her, Nina's hand trembled slightly, but she finally steeled herself and tapped 'add'.

Sean was a paranoid and extremely possessive person. Even if he didn't like her, he would never let her leave him.

Now, the only way to leave him was to get married.

""Hello, I'm Nina.""

The man on the other end didn't respond at all, and Nina froze for a second.

While she was still spacing out, she felt a light tap on her shoulder. ""Hey!""

She turned around, confused, and saw that it was the same young girl who had tapped her.

The young girl had a sweet face, but her skin had an unhealthy paleness to it.

""I'm Isabelle White. And you?""

""Nina.""

""Don't be sad. Whatever it is, it'll pass. I've been through a lot of hardship, and it all passed in the end.""

Nina's restless heart calmed a little. She stared blankly at the clouds outside the window.

Today was Sean's birthday, and she had rushed back from out of state to celebrate with him, not sleeping all night.

But just a moment ago, Sean had told her he didn't have time to pick her up. Nina's fingers unconsciously rubbed the edge of her phone as she followed the crowd off the plane.

Then, she heard a very familiar voice. ""Isabelle.""

Nina's head snapped up, and she saw the man standing not far away.

Sean was in a black suit, waving to Isabelle, his expression as gentle as a calm lake.

Nina's heart gave a painful lurch. Her hand unconsciously tightened on the hem of her dress.

Didn't Sean say he didn't have time...?

As Nina stood there, stunned, Sean, who wasn't far off, seemed to sense something and glanced in her direction.

Nina couldn't look away in time, and her eyes met his cold gaze.

The moment Sean saw her, his brow furrowed. ""Nina, come here.""

It was a command, and Nina had no choice but to brace herself and walk over.

Isabelle froze for a second when she saw Nina, then broke into a wide smile, ""It's you! You must be Sean's girlfriend, right?""

Nina stared at Isabelle, a bit lost in thought. ""You're...""

Just as Sean was about to speak, Isabelle jumped in, ""I'm his sister.""

Sean frowned but didn't say anything more.

When they got in the car, Isabelle offered to sit in the back.

Nina nodded and was about to get into the passenger seat, but Sean stopped her. ""You go in the back. Isabelle isn't well; it's uncomfortable for her back there.""

Looking at his serious expression, Nina slowly nodded and stepped away from the passenger side, an indescribable feeling churning inside her.

She gets terrible car sickness, and Sean knew it. In the three years they were together, she had never sat in the back seat.

Sensing the awkward atmosphere, Isabelle quickly suggested some activities they could play at the birthday party later.

Nina just listened quietly, not saying a word.

Sean frowned and glanced at her, his voice a bit hoarse. ""What's with you today? You're not being very social.""

A sharp pain shot through her heart, as if pierced by a blade. She didn't like lively places; Sean had always known that...

The weather in the southern city was unpredictable; it quickly started raining outside.

David called unexpectedly, ""Nina, you need to clear out your things from the house. The new maid needs the room.""

The Collins family was so huge and wealthy, how could they not even have a spare room...

The car was instantly silent. Nina felt utterly humiliated, her face stinging as if she'd just been slapped hard.

She was helplessly silent, her face filled with exhaustion.

""I want to get out of the car.""

Chapter 3

Sean didn't stop.

""I don't have time to take you back now, the birthday party is about to start. Isabelle's been abroad for so many years, everyone really misses her.""

Her nails dug into her palms. Nina's eyes welled up, and tears almost fell.

But she quickly tilted her head back, forcing the tears back.

The things her mother left her were still at the Collins family's house. If she didn't go get them, those people from the Collins family would probably just throw them away.

""You don't have to take me. Stop the car.""

Sean still didn't stop. Isabelle couldn't stand it anymore.

She frowned, patted Sean's arm, and her voice was soft. ""Stop the car. Nina looks so anxious, she must have something urgent to do. How can you be so inconsiderate? What kind of boyfriend are you?""

The air froze. Almost instantly, the car came to a steady stop on the side of the road.

Nina gave Sean a deep look, then quietly thanked Isabelle. ""Thank you.""

Isabelle gave her a sweet smile. ""You're welcome. There should be an umbrella in the trunk.""

Nina froze for a moment, then shook her head, her slender fingers pulling the car door open.

The moment she got out, the car instantly sped away, as if fleeing from the plague.

She gave a bitter laugh. She had dated Sean for three years and never knew he kept an umbrella in his car.

Raindrops hit Nina's body, cold and piercing.

She took off her high heels and walked barefoot back to the Collins family's house.

By the time she reached the Collins family's house, it was late at night.

The Collins family's house was brightly lit, and the sound of breaking glass came continuously from inside.

Nina quickly ran inside. She was in such a hurry that her foot was cut by a shard of broken glass on the floor, and she couldn't help but frown.

The maids in the villa's courtyard stood in a line, looking at her with unfriendly eyes.

Nina ignored their stares, but when she saw the broken object on the floor, her pupils contracted sharply!

It was a photo frame. Inside was a picture of a beautiful woman holding a little girl's hand. The glass of the frame was now shattered beyond recognition, and the photo itself was blurred from the water...

A sharp pain shot through her chest. The high heels in her hand fell to the ground.

Nina walked forward, picked up the frame, and her slender fingers repeatedly stroked the photo.

""Mom..."" Her silent whisper revealed how broken she was in that moment.

""Well, well! If it isn't our dear Miss Collins, Nina? Why do you look so pathetic? Didn't you snag the heir to the Miller family? And you still ended up looking this miserable.""

A mocking and arrogant voice came from above.

Nina looked up and met the eyes of the woman slowly descending the stairs, hatred flaring in her gaze.

Her face was pale as she said, word by word, ""Jessica, if you have a problem, come at me! This is the last thing my mother left me.""

Jessica laughed as if she'd heard the most ridiculous thing. ""She's not my mother.""

After saying that, Jessica admired her new manicure, her tone dripping with contempt.

""Your dear Sean just proposed to his ex-girlfriend at the birthday party, and you're still here looking for your mom.""

As she spoke, Jessica played a video on her phone.

The man in the video was clearly Sean, and the woman across from him was... Isabelle.

Nina's pupils contracted sharply. The pain from the cut on her ankle became more intense. Her eyes reddened, and she was on the verge of tears.

Seeing her pale face, Jessica pulled back her hand, satisfied. ""I hear you agreed to Dad's marriage arrangement. You should've just done it sooner. So what if Mr. Bronner is ugly? He's rich. You're just like your gold-digging mom. You love money.""

Jessica lounged on the sofa, tossing the words to Nina like charity, ""Dad told me to tell you, you're getting married in twenty days.""

Her fists clenched, and just as Nina was about to lose it, Jessica knew when to stop.

""Oh, by the way, Sean's ex-girlfriend rejected his proposal.""

Chapter 4

Nina didn't know how she got back to her apartment, one hand holding her heels, the other clutching the photo to her chest.

The photo got wet anyway, the beautiful woman's face blurring.

Nina knelt on the cold floor and wailed, repeatedly wiping the rain from the photo, but her own tears kept falling on it.

She cried until she couldn't breathe, collapsing to the floor, choking on her sobs.

There was a sound at the door. The next moment, a pair of black leather shoes appeared in Nina's view.

Sean looked at the woman collapsed on the floor, his brow twitching.

He lifted Nina up, set her on the sofa, his eyes filled with frustration. ""I just didn't drive you to the Collins' place. Do you have to be this dramatic?""

Was it really that big of a deal?

Nina realized in that moment that the man she loved had changed, so much that she could barely recognize him.

Before leaving the Collins family's place, she'd heard the story of Isabelle and Sean. The perfect couple, but for some reason, they broke up.

People said that when they were dating, they were the couple everyone in Los Angeles envied; Sean took every little thing Isabelle casually mentioned to heart.

Nina looked at the man in front of her and smiled bitterly. The difference between being loved and not being loved was really so obvious.

Even though Sean had been good to her for the past three years, she could always feel that he seemed to be looking through her, remembering someone else.

Nina pulled away from him, her expression distant. ""Yes, it is.""

Sean loosened his tie, looking annoyed and weary. ""It's such a trivial thing.""

With that, Sean stood up and left, the door slamming shut with a loud bang.

Nina froze for a second, and soon after, her phone buzzed with a photo from Jessica. She stared at the picture as a tear slid from her eye and dripped onto the screen.

Sean was holding a huge bouquet of roses, standing outside Isabelle's building. But Isabelle wouldn't see him.

That night, Nina barely slept.

This apartment was a gift from Sean, meant to be her safety net. But Nina didn't want it anymore.

Anything that didn't truly belong to her, she no longer wanted.

Nina took the deed to the land registry office and had the name changed to Sean's. She's giving back everything he gave her.

Staring at the green trees outside, Nina zoned out. It had been so long since she'd really taken in the view outside.

Her phone buzzed. It was a friend request from Isabelle.

After some hesitation, Nina accepted. Isabelle asked to meet her at a coffee shop.

When Nina arrived, Isabelle was already seated and waiting.

Seeing her, she broke into a wide smile. ""Hi, Nini, what can I get you to drink?""

Nina froze, then slowly walked over, pulled out a chair, and sat down.

It had been a long time since anyone had called her that. People usually called her Nina, while the Collins family called her ""the illegitimate daughter."" Only Sean ever called her Nini.

But now it seemed it was just his way of remembering Isabelle through her.

""Anything's fine.""

Perhaps noticing her weary expression, Isabelle sighed softly.

""Nini, I'm so sorry.""

Chapter 5

Nina froze, looking at Isabelle with complete confusion.

Isabelle stirred her coffee with a small spoon, her mood instantly sinking.

""I have a congenital heart disease. I won't live past 25, and my 25th birthday is in less than two weeks.""

Those words hit Nina like a bombshell. She gripped the hem of her skirt tightly, not understanding why Isabelle was telling her all this.

""Actually, I lied to you that day. I'm not Sean's sister. Sean and I used to date. I broke up with him when I had to go abroad for treatment.""

This was all new to Nina. She listened quietly, not saying a word.

""Later, I heard from friends that he was in a really bad state, so I used suicide to force him to start a new life. Then, I heard you two got together. I was very happy for you.""

""I don't have long to live. I want you two to be happy together, but I can't change Sean's mind right now. So I also want to apologize for coming here. I know my arrival has caused you a lot of trouble.""

After hearing Isabelle's words, Nina was silent.

She vaguely remembered that day at the airport, her loud crying, and the piece of candy that girl had handed her.

When it came down to it, there was no right or wrong in this whole affair.

Nina slowly looked up, her eyes meeting Isabelle's with a sense of calm. ""I forgive you.""

Hearing this, Isabelle was overjoyed and broke into a radiant smile again.

The crowd around them erupted in noise. Someone had smashed a glass, and it shattered in front of Isabelle with a loud crash.

Almost instantly, Isabelle's face turned a ghastly white, and she clutched her chest tightly.

Seeing this, Nina scrambled to her feet and rushed to Isabelle's side. ""Isabelle, are you okay? Isabelle!""

Isabelle's lips were pale. She pointed shakily at her bag, ""Medicine... in the bag...""

With that, she passed out.

The surrounding noise was a clamor, but Nina could only hear her own heartbeat, growing louder and louder.

With trembling hands, she pulled the bottle of pills from the bag.

Just as she was about to give the medicine to Isabelle, she was shoved hard, falling heavily to the ground. Her palm was instantly pierced by the broken glass, gushing blood.

Nina struggled to look up, her eyes meeting Sean's icy gaze.

He looked at Nina coldly, his voice hoarse. ""I never thought you could be such a vicious person. That's right, I love her. Even if something really happens to Isabelle, I'll devote my whole life to her. Are you satisfied now?""

""If anything happens to Isabelle, I will never let you get away with it.""

Sean's words were like a sharp blade plunging into Nina's heart, leaving it covered in wounds.

She looked dazed, wanting to defend herself. ""I didn't...""

But Sean wouldn't listen to her explanation. He swept Isabelle up in his arms and ran out.

The people around them watched the drama unfold, pointing and whispering at Nina on the floor.

She used to be terrified of being the subject of public gossip, but now, for some reason, she just felt numb.

She slowly got to her feet, her injured hand hanging at her side, blood dripping onto the floor.

Ignoring the stares, Nina slowly walked out of the coffee shop and took a cab to the hospital.

After the doctor bandaged her up, he told her, ""Don't get it wet for a week.""

Nina nodded, and when she got back to her apartment, she found an unexpected guest.

Sean was sitting on the sofa, his long legs crossed and his expression dark.

When he saw Nina, his eyes held a strange emotion. ""What's this about?""

Nina followed his gaze to the property deed, and her heart tightened. ""I don't like this house anymore.""

Hearing her say that, Sean felt something he couldn't quite describe. This was the first gift he had given Nina, and she had taken such good care of every part of the house.

Now that she said she didn't like it anymore, Sean felt surprisingly uneasy, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what the feeling was.

A heavy feeling.

Sean nodded, his expression a bit awkward. ""Let's cancel the wedding.""

In that instant, Nina felt a part of her heart go empty.

But then she smiled and nodded. ""Okay.""

Seeing that she wasn't sad as he'd expected, but instead seemed relieved, Sean felt that indescribable, stifling annoyance again.

He pinched the bridge of his nose. ""Isabelle told me. It wasn't you. She's not well right now, and I don't have the energy to get married at the moment.""

Nina was silent, finding the whole thing absurd.

But in the end, she didn't say anything.

What was the point in saying anything?

Chapter 6

Nina lay in bed, her eyes empty.

Many things from the past surfaced in her mind.

She picked up her phone and checked the date. There were still two weeks until she was to marry Mr. Bronner.

A commotion came from the doorway, and Nina slowly got out of bed and walked to the door.

""I'm not going to marry her.""

Sean was on the phone.

""You can't do this to Nina. She's been with you for so many years. What do you mean you're just calling it off!""

""You're hurting her because of me! What's the point of me being alive then, just to be despised by everyone.""

It was Isabelle's voice.

Nina couldn't put a name to what she was feeling. In the end, she heard Sean's voice give in, gentle and helpless. ""Fine, I'll marry her. You have to take your medicine, okay?""

A wave of bitterness washed over Nina's heart, and she felt a lump in her throat.

Memories from the past came to her mind.

Nina was not favored in the Collins family; she ate even worse than the servants.

When her mother was alive, she would make even the simplest ingredients into something special.

Over time, Nina developed a severe eating disorder and grew thinner and thinner.

After she got with Sean, he would make all sorts of nourishing food for her every day. Whenever Nina didn't want to eat, Sean would drop everything to eat with her.

Sean's tone back then was exactly the same as it was now. ""I'm here with you. You have to eat properly, okay?""

Tears streamed down her cheeks, hitting the floor drop by drop, forming a small puddle.

Nina gave a bitter laugh and lay back down on the bed.

She would be leaving in fifteen days.

It's okay. Once she left, she wouldn't be sad anymore.

Nina was woken up by a noise. Because she was a light sleeper, Sean never used to allow any noise in the house.

She opened the door, went out, and met the eyes of the woman across from her.

Isabelle glanced at her, a guilty look in her eyes, looking so fragile and pitiful.

Seeing her like that, Sean immediately stepped in front of Isabelle to protect her, his tone impatient. ""Why are you looking at Isabelle like that? She's not well. I brought her home to rest for a while. Didn't you get some kind of nutritionist certification? You can take care of Isabelle.""

Nina heard her own heart stop for a moment, then she looked up and forced a smile. ""Okay.""

She was leaving anyway. She could consider this as repaying Sean for all his kindness over the years.

Once she repaid him, it would be time to leave.

After making dinner, Nina felt a bit dizzy and went straight to bed.

She got up in the middle of the night for a drink of water, and when she saw a certain spot, her pupils contracted sharply.

Her mother's belongings were gone!

She had clearly put them on the table after bringing them back from the Collins family that day! How could they be gone!

Maybe Sean put them somewhere, Nina tried to comfort herself.

She opened every cabinet in the house, searching through all of them.

Nothing!

Nothing!

Still nothing!

The panic in her heart grew more intense, and her hands began to tremble uncontrollably.

Perhaps the noise she made rummaging through the cabinets woke Sean up.

He came out of the room, bleary-eyed, and looked at Nina with a displeased expression.

""What are you doing? Making noise in the middle of the night? Don't you know Isabelle can't stand noise?""

Right now, Nina had no mind to be hurt by his words. She looked at Sean desperately, like a little animal lost from its mother, her face full of vulnerability.

""Where's my mom's picture?"" Nina's voice was even trembling slightly.

Sean frowned, his eyes darting away.

Nina saw his expression in an instant. She shot up, rushed over, and gripped Sean's arms tightly.

""Where is my mom's picture!"" Her scream was hoarse and desperate.

Sean frowned, his face filled with impatience.

""I threw it away, alright!""

Chapter 7

Those words hit Nina's heart like a bomb.

She froze, as if she hadn't heard what he said.

""What... did you say?""

Sean didn't dare to look her in the eye. ""It's bad to keep things from the dead in the house. Isabelle needs to rest.""

This time, Nina heard him clearly.

She slowly pulled back her hands, letting them fall to her sides. Her eyes gradually turned red, and tears fell, hitting the ground.

Nina was going crazy. How could Sean throw away the only photo her mother left her!

He knew perfectly well how important her mother was to her.

""Where did you throw it?"" Her voice was full of despair and disappointment, completely lifeless.

""I don't know. Maybe it's already been hauled away.""

As soon as Sean finished speaking, Nina bolted out, but he grabbed her.

His eyes were full of disapproval as he frowned at the pale woman. ""Are you crazy? It's pouring outside!""

The man's grip was strong, leaving a white mark on Nina's arm.

But right then, Nina felt like a piece of her heart was missing, her mind a complete blank.

If she couldn't find her mother's photo, she couldn't imagine what would become of her.

It was pouring rain outside. Nina ran into the downpour, drenched by the cold water.

She found the nearest trash can, knocked it over, and knelt on the ground to start digging through it.

The trash can smelled awful, but Nina couldn't seem to smell anything. She just mechanically searched for that photo.

Thunder cracked right by Nina's ear, and she curled up in fear.

Rainwater poured down her collar and back, but she couldn't feel the cold, only a dull, hollow ache in her chest.

Nothing!

Nina ran to another trash can to search. Her fingertips were already wrinkled from the water, and the rain blurred her vision. She could no longer tell if it was rain or tears.

A gentle woman seemed to appear before her, reaching out a hand. ""My sweet Nina.""

Nina knelt on the ground, staring blankly at the woman before her, her eyes overflowing with sorrow. ""Mom! I miss you so much!""

She rushed forward to hug the woman, but in the next moment, the woman vanished.

Nina collapsed to the ground, realizing it had all been a hallucination.

She murmured to her reflection in a puddle, her nails scraping faint, bloody lines on the concrete. ""Mom, I'm begging you, don't take away the only thing you left me.""

Just as she spoke, Nina's left hand touched something hard. She paused, then pulled it out.

It was the photo frame.

Rain had already seeped into the frame, ruining the already faded photo.

But Nina still felt the joy of finding what was lost. She clutched the frame and cried loudly in the rain, her voice hoarse.

Sean sat in his car, the wipers constantly clearing the rain from the windshield. He watched Nina kneeling in the rain not far away, his face expressionless.

But his hands on the steering wheel were trembling. He closed his eyes, and images of Nina's past suicide attempts seemed to flash in his mind.

When he opened his eyes again, Nina had already collapsed in the rain.

Sean threw open the car door and rushed into the downpour.

When he saw the ruined photo frame clutched in Nina's arms, his pupils couldn't help but tremble, and it felt like something was stuck in his throat.

He scooped Nina up from the ground, her eyelashes beaded with water droplets, and when Sean tried to wipe the rain from her face, he flinched, startled by her burning temperature.

""Nina, I'll take you to the hospital.""

Chapter 8

Sean put her in the back seat and started the car.

Nina was conscious, but her body was burning up, alternating between hot and cold, her teeth chattering softly.

She tried to open her eyes to see, but she just couldn't.

A phone rang, and she heard Sean's urgent voice.

""What? Isabelle has a fever? I'm coming back right now.""

Something inside her felt hollow. Nina shed a single, scalding tear that landed on her arm, burning hot.

The car returned to the apartment. Sean got out hurriedly, his movements rushed, without a moment's hesitation.

Nina clutched her mother's photo frame, waiting and waiting.

She waited until it was almost dawn, but Sean never came back down.

Her body was still burning hot. Nina was now trembling from the fever. With shaky hands, she pulled out her phone and called for an ambulance.

While waiting for the ambulance, every minute felt like an eternity. Her limbs felt like lead, unable to move, and her skin was on fire, as if being eaten by countless tiny bugs.

Thankfully, the ambulance arrived quickly. Nina felt a wave of relief, as if she'd found her lifeline, and closed her eyes.

When she opened her eyes again, the smell of disinfectant instantly filled her nostrils.

Nina struggled to sit up, but before she could react, a sharp, stinging pain spread across her face.

She looked at the person in disbelief. Sean was staring at her, his face dark, his eyes filled with disgust.

His disgusted look stung Nina instantly. She gripped the bedsheet tightly, ""What do you mean?""

Sean looked at her like she was trash, his tone mocking, ""You've got some nerve, opening Isabelle's window to make her sick.""

Nina froze for a moment, then retorted, ""I didn't.""

After she said that, Sean's expression grew even darker.

""You also switched Isabelle's medicine. She had an attack last night and almost died!""

Nina didn't know why Sean would think it was her. Her throat was dry, but she still said, ""I didn't.""

Seeing her refuse to admit it, Sean's anger intensified. He sneered, ""Fine, you won't admit it, huh?""

He saw the photo frame on the table, a smirk playing on his lips as he picked it up.

When Nina saw his movement, alarm bells went off in her head. ""What are you doing?!""

""I'm going to show you what happens when you bully Isabelle.""

As soon as he finished speaking, Sean let go of the photo frame.

Smash!

The glass of the frame shattered into pieces.

Nina's heart clenched painfully. ""Don't!""

She reached to pick it up, but Sean was faster. He hooked the photo out of the frame with his large hand.

Then Sean looked at Nina, smirked, and tore the photo in half, then into quarters, until it was completely unrecognizable.

In that moment, Nina heard the sound of her own heart breaking.

""No!""

Her cry was one of extreme sorrow, filled with grief.

She watched helplessly as Sean tossed the pieces out the window. A gust of wind blew them away, leaving no trace.

Nina stared blankly, her shoulders slumped. It was as if her soul had been ripped from her body, and she collapsed onto the bed.

Her fingers curled unconsciously, digging her nails deep into her palms, as if trying to mask the pain in her heart with physical pain.

When she turned around, she saw Isabelle standing in the doorway, a triumphant, taunting smile on her face.

A chill ran through her, and Nina's fingertips were ice-cold.

At this point, what wasn't there to understand?

So her innocence and kindness were just an act, but Nina didn't understand what she had done to offend her, to make her want revenge like this.

It turned out she had orchestrated the whole thing herself.

Nina watched coldly as Sean held Isabelle tenderly, while Isabelle, with red-rimmed eyes, said that Nina must have suffered.

""It must be a mistake. Nina would never hurt me, Sean.""

Chapter 9

Sean frowned and stroked Isabelle's hair. ""Isabelle, you're still too kind.""

With that, he swept Isabelle up into his arms. ""Silly Isabelle, you shouldn't be running around. I'm taking you for a check-up.""

After they left, Nina sat on the bed and gave a bitter smile.

She pulled out her phone and checked the time.

Five days left.

She went back to her apartment, packed all her belongings into a suitcase, and realized that after all these years here, her actual possessions couldn't even fill one suitcase.

Nina felt pathetic. She was sitting on the floor when the door flew open, making her jump.

Sean stood in front of her, looking frantic. ""Isabelle needs surgery. You're a match. I need you to go donate your heart to her now.""

Nina couldn't believe her ears. Sean was asking for her life.

She shook her head, refusing. ""I won't go.""

Sean was instantly furious. His lips pressed into a thin line, showing his displeasure.

Just as he was about to say something else, the hospital called.

""Mr. Miller, Ms. White couldn't be revived and has passed away. Our condolences.""

The phone clattered to the floor. Sean's hand slowly dropped to his side, his face ashen.

The next moment, he looked at Nina with madness in his eyes. ""This is all your fault! If you hadn't switched Isabelle's medicine, if you hadn't refused to give her your heart, she wouldn't have died!""

Nina was startled by his crazed look. She tried to run, but Sean grabbed her.

He took a pair of pliers and pulled out all ten of her fingernails.

The excruciating pain of her nails being torn from their beds was like a red-hot wire being shoved into her flesh, a sharp, serrated tearing that left Nina drenched in a cold sweat.

A sharp ringing filled her ears, and her vision went black. She could even smell the metallic scent of blood, and a nauseating acid rose in her stomach.

Nina's face was pale. She looked at Sean. ""I told you I didn't do it.""

But Sean said nothing, just watched her quietly.

She didn't know how much time had passed. Nina had fainted from the pain several times, and Sean was long gone.

Nina saw the window that hadn't been closed, and a powerful urge to escape flared up inside her.

She had to escape.

She stumbled to the window and used her nail-less hands to pull herself up. Pain instantly shot through her entire body, and her back was soaked with cold sweat. Nina climbed onto the windowsill.

Today was the last day. She needed to get out of here.

The apartment was on the third floor. A fall from here wouldn't kill her. Nina looked down at the ground, her vision blurring. All she could hear was her own ragged breathing and her heartbeat.

The next moment, she jumped without hesitation. The instant her body hit the lawn, Nina heard the sound of a bone dislocating.

A sharp pain, like a knife cut, shot through her thigh, her left arm went numb, and she could taste the faint metallic tang of blood in her throat.

But the moment she landed, she didn't dare to stop.

Sean was a madman, and all she could do now was run.

The feeling of having survived a disaster washed over her as Nina ran frantically onto the road and saw a car stopped in front of her.

The car window slowly rolled down, and Jessica leaned out.

She frowned when she saw Nina's bleeding hands.

""Get in.""

Chapter 10

Nina got in the car.

She looked at Jessica in the driver's seat and couldn't help but ask, ""What are you doing here?""

Jessica blew out a puff of smoke, a complicated look in her eyes.

""Tomorrow's the deadline. If I don't come find you, am I supposed to be the one getting married?""

That shut Nina up. She fell silent.

""I get it.""

Jessica took her to the hospital.

After her wounds were bandaged, they sat across from each other in silence. Jessica looked at her older sister, not knowing what to feel.

She couldn't quite describe her feelings for Nina. It definitely wasn't love, but it wasn't quite hate either.

But Nina's existence had indeed made her and her mother a laughingstock, and she had done many things to hurt Nina over the years.

But seeing Nina in such a miserable state, messed up by someone else, actually made her feel a bit irritated.

Only she was allowed to bully Nina.

Looking at Nina's pale face, Jessica frowned, stood up, and handed her a USB drive.

Nina saw the USB drive in her palm and looked at Jessica in confusion. ""What is this?""

The pain in her ten fingers was still excruciating, and Nina's face was pale.

Jessica saw her like this and curled her lip. ""You idiot. Did you really think Isabelle saw you as a sister? You're unbelievably stupid. Her heart condition was cured a long time ago! This is all the dirty stuff she's done. Consider it my compensation to you for all these years. Now I don't owe you anything anymore.""

Her tone was irritated, but Nina could tell she was concerned about her.

The USB drive in her hand suddenly felt as heavy as lead.

She plugged the USB drive into her computer, and when she saw what was on it, her face instantly turned pale.

Nina's lips trembled. ""She... she could actually do something like this.""

Jessica looked disdainful. ""People like her only care about saving themselves. They don't care who dies.""

It's true Isabelle had a heart condition, but she's already been cured.

The White family funded orphanages in many cities, went to great lengths to find a girl who was a match for Isabelle, and then... they took that girl's heart. A living, breathing person was gone just like that.

It seems Isabelle faked her death this time, too.

Nina clutched the USB drive in her hand and sent the evidence to her lawyer. People who do evil must be punished.

Nina looked up at Jessica and said softly, ""Jessica, thank you.""

Jessica awkwardly turned her head away. ""Don't get the wrong idea. I just don't want to owe you anything.""

As she spoke, she pulled something out from behind her back.

Nina took a closer look and saw it was a photo of her and her mom!

Joy instantly flooded her heart, a smile dancing in her eyes. She looked at Jessica, pleasantly surprised.

Seeing her so happy, the gloom on Jessica's brow gradually faded.

""Back then, I did want to bully you, but I also knew this was the only photo your mom left you. I made a copy. The one I smashed was the copy. This is the original.""

A wave of emotion washed over her.

Nina took the photo with trembling hands, clutching it tightly to her chest, her eyes glistening with tears.

She thought she would never see the keepsake her mother left her again in this lifetime, but she never expected to get it back so soon.

""Thank you, Jessica.""

Jessica turned her head away. ""I transferred a million dollars to your account. Dad wouldn't give you a dowry. But you're going in my place, so I'm giving this to you.""

With that, Jessica strode away, looking like she was desperately trying to escape.

Nina watched her retreating back, stunned for a long moment.

The one good thing was, she could finally leave Sean.

As night fell, a respectful, middle-aged man in black knocked on Nina's hospital room door.

""Ms. Collins, Mr. Bronner sent me to pick you up.""

Nina nodded.

After getting into the car, she stared out the window at the receding scenery, feeling dazed.

She was finally leaving.

as many of you are preparing for Phrecia re-launch next week, I'm happy to announce I'll be making an update to my Idol and Strategy Planner: [https://idolplanner.easyexile.tools/](https://idolplanner.easyexile.tools/)

if you haven't used it last time, it's a tool to plan and share full farming strategies within Phrecia setup so:

* idols mods and placement
* scarabs choice
* atlas device option

throughout last league, it grew to include some handy features like:

* featured strategies library with nearly 20 entries - many of them will most likely still be viable this time around
* local storage support for saving own strategies
* trade link generator for idols

I'll be updating the database of both Idols and Scarabs modifiers once we'll learn more about balance changes but feel free to browse best strategies from last Phrecia entry or plan ahead.

as usual, looking forward to your feedback and hope you'll have a blast using my tools!

Then this donda appears. I think he did notice me earlier, photographing and sht.

Before I even understand what’s happening, he grips my hand.

Not violent. Not dramatic.
Just… firm. Controlled. Like a man who has done this before and passed iq checks.

I felt it. The grip was weirdly balanced not hard, not soft, just enough to say “I got you” without asking permission. His hand was big, slightly veiny, like it’s been working since 5am and still has energy.

My brain immediately opened ten tabs.

First thought: Ah. This is how those videos start.
Second thought: If I disappear, at least it will be efficiently done.
Third thought: Why is this grip so… intentional?

He doesn’t rush me. That’s the scary part. He moves like he already decided I’m coming along. Like he clocked my face and said, “Yeah. Huyu ni soft background. Handle with care.”

We cross the road together. Cars. Noise. Madness.

Then he looks at me.

Not up and down. Not suspicious. Just straight to the face.

And he smiles.

A calm smile. A don’t panic smile. The kind that makes you panic more because now you don’t know what game this is.

Next thing I know, I’m being ushered into a sleek matatu. Clean seats. Good music. Vibes suspiciously premium. He finds me a seat like a gentleman escorting a VIP, then stands there casually like this is the most normal thing in the world. Looks at me, that smile again, and sits next to me. He smelled nice, Michael's perfume I'd say.

Then he starts talking.

Casually.

Like we’re old friends.

He says, “Relax. I’d never harm you.”
SIR???
WHERE IS THAT INFORMATION COMING NOW???

Then he adds, “Just stay around if you’re not busy. We can chat as I work. It would make my day.” 

AS. HE. WORKS. Like WTAF is happening?

I’m seated there nodding like, “Haha yeah sure”, while my mind is screaming, “WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHY AM I NOT RUNNING?”

I find it strange, like I wanted to run, but I 100% wanted to stay.
We actually talked. About random things. Life. Town. Nothing dramatic. Nothing threatening. Just conversation. Calm. Almost wholesome which somehow made it MORE confusing.

Before I leave, numbers are exchanged. He'd call we have coffee.

He said: let's take a trip as I drop and come back to town, you won't pay.
I'm like, ""cool."" COOL???? 

Back in town, we chat kidogo then the byes, that grip again, releases, then
I walk away in a daze.

No harm. No drama. No whisking. Just vibes, confusion, and a core memory unlocked.

It’s been hours and I’m still in awe. Still don’t know what that was. Still replaying the grip in my head like, why was it so perfectly measured??

Town is wild.

Sometimes danger doesn’t shout.
Sometimes it smiles, finds you a seat, and asks if you’re busy.
But I don't know if this was danger, now I have to find him, funnily I just need to know where this goes. What are we? Lmao

I’m stuck between the Hario Switch 03 and the NextLevel Pulsar. I’d really appreciate input from people who have used either (or both).

What I'm looking for is a method that allows me to experiment with any type of coffee beans (natural, washed, light, medium roast, etc.), but is still consistent and not overly fussy.

Some considerations:
- I already own an electric gooseneck kettle and a Gabi Drip Master B (so I can standardize pouring if needed).
- I drink a lot of decaf (as well as regular coffee) so I would apreciate a method that can handle these easily too.

1qmeksl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qmeksl/when_a_coffee_invitation_ended_everything/,When a coffee invitation ended everything,"We met online. He was a somewhat recognizable figure in his niche, the sensitive intellectual type who claimed he struggled with emotions. I was an artistic soul, in a long term relationship. For two years we built something he stubbornly labeled as pure friendship, even though the emotional temperature suggested something else entirely.

There was rare chemistry. We understood each other almost instinctively, shared music, talked about health issues and life fears. He told me I was intriguing, that he loved talking to me, that I was his safe place. There was constant ambiguity. On one hand he insisted on distance, on the other he fed me attention and emotional intimacy that, according to him, he did not have anywhere else.

There was one problem. His partner. She clearly disliked me and felt threatened, even though we never crossed certain lines. He knew this. He complained about being controlled, yet played both sides. With me he insisted I mattered, at home he acted as if I was nobody. He sent signals, pulled away, then came back. A classic cycle of hot and cold, attraction and withdrawal. He explained it by saying he did not want to be misunderstood, only to resume late night intellectual flirting shortly after.

Everything collapsed when I decided to check whether this connection was more than words on a screen. I was going to be in his city. I suggested a casual meeting, coffee, lunch, anything. No hidden agenda, just two people who knew each other well. His reaction was panic. Instead of an adult conversation, I received a wall of text. He accused me of pressure, of cornering him. He cast himself as the victim forced to choose between loyalty to his partner and seeing me. He said the train had already left, even though I was not asking for an escape, just a face to face conversation.

I tried to explain, to deescalate. The response was silence. He blocked me. Everywhere. On every platform, in every shared community. After two years of near daily contact, I was cut out overnight. No goodbye. No apology. No explanation.

The worst came later. A mutual friend asked him about it. He admitted he had cut me off on all channels for the so called greater good. When asked whether he wanted to pass on any final message to close things properly, he said he had thought about it and decided it was not worth it. Better to ignore it.

He chose convenience. He silenced his guilt with a block so he would not have to face the fact that he handled this poorly.

For a long time I thought this was his partner’s doing, that he was forced. Now I know that was nonsense. He felt relief. Disappearing was easier than honesty. He turned me into a problem to delete so he could have peace of mind. I am now pouring that anger into writing and music, creating something of my own. And him? He probably still sits safely in his bubble, presenting himself as an empathetic man he is not.

**So...**  
If someone tells you they cannot do relationships, believe them. When it matters, they will sacrifice your connection without blinking just to avoid leaving their comfort zone. Silence is also an answer, and it is the loudest one.

**TL;DR**  
A man in his thirties, the leader of a small online community, with whom I shared an intense intellectual bond for two years, panicked when a real life meeting became possible. Despite constant reassurance about how important our connection was, he blocked me everywhere without a goodbye, hiding behind the supposed wellbeing of his jealous partner. Through a mutual friend I later learned that when asked if he had any last words for me, he simply waved it off.",2,1769332982.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

1qmejrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qmejrs/mugen_biscoff_brew/,Mugen Biscoff Brew,"Woke up this morning and felt in a baked goods mood, but didn’t really want to eat. Have this **Scenery Colombia Eder Bedoya’s Chiroso** (Kaffir Lime, Rosehip, Biscoff Spread). Straight off the bat this coffee announces itself with the Biscoff. But to accentuate the rosehip you need to slowly draw it down. So this morning I used a combination of the Hario Mugen with Cafec T90. A fast paper with a steady brewer. This allows me to keep a steady flow, but holds the water around the coffee for longer to bring out a very sweet tasting cup (Biscoff and Kaffir) straight from first sip. This is followed with a light tea-like floral (rosehip) as the sweetness dissipates, finally leaving the biscuity qualities of creaminess and caramelised sugar to remain in the mouth long after the  having drank each coffee sip/gulp, before finally giving you what I would call the coffee coffee taste. This coffee has truly been a delight to brew. I have brewed a standard Hario V60 with T90s and T92; Kalita 155; and this mornings Hario Mugen. If I’m being totally honest, V60 is the way to go, as balance is not required here. You want to bring forward all parts of this coffee and conical brewing is the way. If you are able to get access to this coffee from Scenery, you won’t regret it.

I usually use beans with my moka (Bialetti 6 cups), honestly, for the routine more than taste in my case.

Now I got coffee pre-ground to use (until it’s used, it’s from my previous neighbour when she moved out)Same brand as beans I use sometimes.

And With the same amount of coffee in the basket, the beans are way more bitter (or more precisely. full basket:pre ground Ok, beans bitter. about 30 g both Ok)

**Title:** What’s the ONE Woodworking Mistake You’ll Never Make Again?

---

I remember the exact project that humbled me — a simple coffee table that turned into my biggest lesson in woodworking.

I rushed the glue-up, didn’t double-check my square, and told myself “close enough.”  
Of course, the next morning, the top had dried twisted, the legs rocked, and the only thing stable was my frustration.

That day was the turning point.  
I realized most of my mistakes had nothing to do with talent — they came from impatience. From skipping the fundamentals because I was too focused on “finishing.”

These days, I slow down. I double-measure, I let joints *cure in peace*, and I remind myself: *the wood always wins if you try to cheat it.*

So I’m curious to hear from everyone here —  
**What’s the one mistake you swore you’d never make again?**  
Was it a rushed cut? The wrong finish? Forgetting to account for wood movement?

Let’s trade lessons and maybe save someone else from the same heartache.

1qmedq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1qmedq9/bad_clones_of_your_pets/,Bad Clones of Your Pets,"Hello everyone, it's 2:47 AM here. I just woke up from a really bad dream.

I was dreaming about some silly Percy Jackson thing, and then it suddenly switched to a very realistic dream where it was just a normal day at home.

Suddenly, I realized that my pets were kind of ""duplicating"" because my old dog was with the young one, and that shouldn't happen because we don't let them get together anymore. Anyway... I went to the terrace with them to separate them, and I realized that my mom had the original young dog.

When I got to them, the ""clone"" started growling horribly at me when it saw that I was trying to protect my old dog. I managed to get him away, or the clone disappeared. I went inside and told my mom, but she seemed to ignore me or not care. Then I heard growling, and there was the clone again, chasing my dog. I went outside and tried to keep them at a distance, but when I saw the parakeet cage, I realized there were four instead of two. These new ones looked like they were dying, and they also wanted to attack the original parakeets.

So I took the ""clone"" parakeets out. They writhed around, trying to peck me and everything. I took them to my mom, but she wouldn't look up and wouldn't pay any attention to me. When I tried to make one of the clones fly out of my house, it started writhing like it was possessed, and I couldn't seem to let go of it. It moved and twisted with my hand and disappeared.

So I took the ""clone"" parakeets out. Then I'm back on the terrace, scared because I feel like there's some kind of evil entity there, and I don't know what to do. But suddenly, a little black guy appears with coffee, lets me refill it, and I manage to calm down and wake up.

It's worth clarifying that I haven't seen anything scary or anything like that before going to sleep, nor in the last few days.

1qme82l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Deadlands/comments/1qme82l/deadlands_dark_ages_the_technology_of_877_saxon/,Deadlands Dark Ages: The Technology of 877 Saxon England,"I read my PDF copy of *Deadlands: Dark Ages* recently, and since it's set in 877, I figured it might be entertaining to go through a list of some technologies that do or don't exist in that time and place! (Obviously the hex-guns are anachronistic technology, but that's due to Merlin's magical meddling.)

A lot of fantasy adventure gaming owes roots to AD&D, which started out modeling the Hundred Years' War era (England and France in the 13th & 14th centuries), which means that people might be a little startled by some of the technologies that *don't* exist in the earlier period of Saxon England. It's why there's no plate armor in the game: It's not in use in that time and place; the mail hauberk is the best armor available in the setting!

**Note:** I'm not a historian of technology, so this is a very surface-level read. Experts in respective fields might have quibbles over some of these, which is cool as it's always fun to learn something new. This is based on the best information that I have available to me!

**Agriculture, Housing & Industry**

*The Chimney*. The earliest domestic chimney in England dates to 1185, and they didn't come into common residential use until the 16th century. Industrial chimneys (for forges and kilns) do exist, but in a house? You have a firepit or central stove.

*The Horse Collar.* This technology doesn't arrive in Europe until the 10th century, just after the time period of *DL:DA*.  There might be a variant kind of technology called the throat-and-girth harness instead. Ploughs are pulled by oxen, which are not as fast as horses, meaning that agriculture by plow is less efficient.

*The Horseshoe.* There is clear *written* evidence of cast bronze horseshoes with nails existing by the 11th century, but references to earlier ""hipposandals"" might refer to a leather boot with a metal sole. The iron horseshoe made by a blacksmith and nailed into a hoof as seen in medieval and Western media probably doesn't exist yet!

*The Heavy Plow.* The wheeled plow, with a heavier blade suited to the thicker soils of northern Europe, probably shows up in late 9th century, right about the time of the setting. This might be a ""new fangled invention"" that improves the lives of farmers markedly by making it possible to farm in areas where the soil is thicker and more clayey.

*Vertical Windmills.* While these exist in Persia in this time period, they haven't reached England yet.

*The Water Mill*. This technology *does* exist and is well-established. It is your principal form of natural power for turning a shaft to rotate a grinding wheel to grind grain. With the cam, it also provides the trip hammer, which can be used to pound things like grain or cloth or paper.

*The Sawmill.* Doesn't show up in Europe until the 1300s. You cut wood the hard way.

*Bloomeries.* The water mill (above) could use its power to run a bellow for a smelter—but it didn't in Europe until around the 12th century or so. Making iron or steel is a difficult process that's done by hand. ""Damascus steel"" probably does exist in the Middle East, but cast iron doesn't yet.

*Glass.* Transparent glass doesn't exist yet in the area and won't for some time. If you need light, you use a candle or torch; a lantern has metal shutters with small holes in them, because there's no glass. Windows likewise don't have glass, it's just too expensive. Opaque green glass does exist, but it's rare. Stained glass isn't available yet.

**Weapons & Armor**

*Plate armor.* Famously from the 14th to 16th centuries. The kind of body-shaped plate famous in knightly museum displays (and the movie *Excalibur*, referenced as inspiration for the setting book) doesn't exist yet in England. Greek and Roman armorers did make partial plate body pieces in antiquity, but that fell out of the tech tree by the time of post-Roman medieval England.

*Lances.* Lances do exist, as does the stirrup, but massed lancer cavalry isn't a dominant field tactic for another couple of centuries.

*Longbows.* The famous English (or Welsh) longbow *probably* didn't exist before the 12th century, but the written attestations are not always easy to parse. Of course, hunting bows are common.

*Crossbows.* While the crossbow becomes much more prominent in later centuries (c. 13th onward), there is some archeological evidence that they were used for hunting in Scotland in the time period of the setting! Without steel, composite frames, or winch systems, they are probably much less powerful than later armor-piercing crossbows that draw Papal denunciation, though.

*Pole arms.* Most pole arms don't formalize until the 11th century in England, though of course there are spears, and anyone with a farm implement that has a pole can lash something sharp to the end.

*Helmets.* The helm of the era is the nose helm, which is basically a metal cap with a bar projection that goes down the bridge of the nose. It is usually worn with a coif and aventail for neck protection. Close-faced helms and great helms are a later period invention.

**Food**

*Canned food.* While certain other fantasy adventure games may feature ""iron rations,"" canned food doesn't show up in Europe until the Napoleonic era, when someone figures out that you can preserve food by putting it in a bottle with some water, corking it, and then putting it in a hot water bath for several minutes. (It's being sterilized, but they don't have germ theory yet, so they don't understand the mechanism.) A crude form of food transport exists in the form of the *huff paste*, which is a kind of tough pie-crust that you seal up and cook, incidentally sterilizing the contents, and then carry. When you want to eat the contents, you break open the leathery crust (which is usually inedible).

*Sugar.* Won't reach England for another two centuries or thereabouts!

*Tomatoes and potatoes, precious.* Haven't been brought over yet!

*Raw vegetables.* Considered to cause disease, so vegetables were always cooked. (Shallot, watercress, beetroot, and so on.) Root vegetables like carrots were considered lower class food.

*Chocolate and coffee.* Chocolate doesn't arrive until the 17th century. Coffee shows up around the same time.

**Navigation and Travel**

*Sextant.* Won't exist for some time, but ancient astrolabes do, and there is a lot of material written about them in the Arabic world.

*Compasses.* The dry compass doesn't show up in Europe until the 14th century. Crude compass technology exists in India and China, though, for all the good that does you on the other side of the planet.

*Caravels and galleys.* The sailing vessels of the time and place are knarrs, longships, and cogs.

alright so i have started developing interest into relationships etc , now what i mean by that is...i wasn't really interested in relationships and all even after 2 years in college.

it isnt that like i can pull etc i got enough amount of proposals but since something else was goin in my mind i wasnt really reacting to these things.

i met this girl in a competition (shes from my clg as well) she's pretty famous in clg , got a boyfriend as well and i knew it already. After 2 days into the competition we started talking and on that day itself,  after the completion of our performance at night she started crying  cuz of her poor performance i consolidated her by cracking jokes about other performers she giggled and was happy again.

When we were about to leave the backstage and going to the rooms she asked me to hold her hand as that dress was difficult to manage we walked for 10min and while walking there she started dumping her past (not trauma but more like whatever she did before college) and when we finally reached out rooms she asked ""magar mai ye tujhe kyu bata rahi hu?"" means why am i telling all this to you, i said ""idk?"" and left her hand and joined my boys group.

Later when we were on our way to back to our city (in college bus) she asked me to sit near her and again we started talking (she also asked for my shoulder so that she can rest her head on it) again we talked and did a fun convo.

TBH i was flattered till now

We met again in cllg after 2-3 days and she asked me if i can go with her for a coffee as she had noone to accompany her we talked again and this time i told her about my previous relationship and how we broke-up (we broke-up on the day of competition itself and she knew it)  she asked me if i was sad about the breakup but i said its okay its the part of the journey.

we met again after a week of this incident and while we were having our energy drinks which i bought her she said ""why are you buying me these things ? do you like me?"" i was like FUCKKK!!! thats not how it was supposed to go. I said no just to see her reaction and she was like ""karte ho toh karte raho"" means if you do then keeping going i dont care.

after this i stopped meeting her as i got clue what she was upto , she rang me few times on that day itself but i didnt respond a month later she met me again irl (which i was trying to avoid) came to me shaked my hand and i did a mistake of not leaving her hand and pulled her towards me and she was like ""woahh""  , we talked again and left

same day when i was playing volley with my friends she came to the court and started staring me , stared that much that even i was started getting nervous which made me rethink all of my life  choices and what am i even doing in my life.

Any of you have a clue what should i do and what she's upto? I'm feeling off just cuz she had a boyf otherwise im good to go.

Bruh I’ve been suffering years long bipolar depression and it’s ruined my life. I have been unintentionally neglecting my comic I crave continuing but I literally cannot even sketch the bare minimum for even my more random art half the time. I feel pathetic because I can’t even do the one thing I love and put years of thought into. Even with intense medication the depression has lasted years. I sometimes have extreme mania, even without strong coffee, even after drinking many beers, but it’s not as common as I need it. I don’t want it, I need it. But mania feeds my other disorders too (undiagnosed issues but my family speculates specific ones unrelated to bipolar). 

I hate this shit so much. I take heavy doses of one medication, another, another, and a different thing (I don’t mind questions) but it helps only a little. The other medication helps my other issue but nothing stops the extreme bipolar depression no matter how hard I try. I’m so unmotivated half the time and I cannot put into words how debilitating it is. I hardly can even wake up after several alarms, family trying to wake me up, and the wanting to wake up. I just increased the drug my psychiatrist told me would benefit motivation so I hope to any supernatural entity that it fucking helps me. Going completely off my meds will make my depression and mania be completely uncontrollable and even more extreme. My brain is making a cruel joke every day since I was not even ten years old. It’s natural but I know it’s not supposed to be ‘natural’ to people. It’s can’t afford therapy, and I don’t trust therapy personally due to issues I always had with it as a kid.

\- 바스켓 기하학 기반의 밀도 지도 설계 -  

\- Designing Density Maps Based on Basket Geometry -



부제:추출은 밀도다. 

Extraction is Density.



1. 서론: 커피는 숙련된 노동인가, 설계된 시스템인가?

에스프레소 추출에서 ‘채널링’은 바리스타의 숙명처럼 여겨져 왔다. 

많은 이들이 탬핑의 강도나 분쇄도 조절이라는 개인의 숙련도에 의지해 이 문제를 해결하려 하지만, 인간의 감각은 매 순간 변수 앞에 노출된다. 

지난 15년간 현장에서 연구해온 결론은 명확하다. 커피는 숙련된 노동이 아닌, 철저히 계산된 밀도 시스템에 의해 추출되어야 한다. 

본고에서는 바스켓의 기하학적 특성과 이종 규격 툴을 결합하여 내부 밀도 지도를 능동적으로 설계하는 

\*\*'채널링 유도 기법(Density Guiding Method, D.G.M)'\*\*을 소개하고자 한다.



하이브리드 툴을 이용하여 중앙과 바닥의 밀도를 높이고 외벽을 보강하여 엣지 채널링을 보완할 것이다.



전통적 추출 이론에서 볶음도, 도징량, 분쇄도, 레벨링, 템핑은 모두 변수다. 이를 부정하는 사람은 없을 것이다. 

추출은 밀도라는 대전제 아래 채널링 유도 기법을 통하여 하나씩 상수화하여 결국 분쇄도 하나만을 남길 것이다. 

앞으로 추출은 분쇄도 하나만을 조절하는 방법으로 바뀔 것이다. 억지 같은가? 



1. Introduction: Skilled Labor or Designed System?

In espresso extraction, ""channeling"" has long been regarded as the inevitable fate of a barista. Many attempt to solve this by relying on individual skills, such as tamping pressure or grind adjustment, but human senses are constantly exposed to variables. After 15 years of field research, my conclusion is clear: Extraction must transcend the limitations of manual labor and become a strictly calculated system of density. In this paper, I introduce the 'Density Guiding Method (D.G.M)', which actively designs an internal density map by combining basket geometry with multi-spec tools.



The hybrid tool is designed to consolidate core and bottom density while reinforcing the perimeter, thereby physically neutralizing edge channeling through structural redistribution.



In traditional extraction theory, roast level, dose, grind size, leveling, and tamping are all variables. No one would deny this. Under the grand premise that ""Extraction is Density,"" D.G.M will Systematically stabilize these variables into constants, eventually leaving only the grind size. In the future, extraction will shift toward a method where only the grind size is adjusted. Does that sound far-fetched?



2. 실험 및 추출 조건

Experimental and Extraction Conditions



볶음도: 중볶음 (Roast Level: Medium Roast)



도징량: 19g - 20g (Dose: 19g - 20g)



추출 타겟: 리스트레또(Ristretto) 투샷, 스파웃 15ml + 15ml 크레마 포함 30ml (Target: Double Ristretto (Spouted: 15ml + 15ml / Total 30ml including crema)



표준 추출 시간: 20초 \~ 24초 (Standard Extraction Time: 20s \~ 24s)



분쇄도: 위 범위를 충족하는 범위 내 (Grind Size: Within the range that satisfies the above parameters)



3. 본론: 테이퍼드 구조를 장악하는 ‘이종 규격 설계’

3. Main Body: ""Multi-Spec Design"" Dominating Tapered Structures



13년 된 스파웃(Spout) 포터필터(라마르조꼬 구형 포타필터)를 사용하는 환경에서는 퍽 내부의 물리적 변화를 시각적으로 확인할 수 없다. 

따라서 물이 흐르기 전 이미 모든 저항값이 결정되는 ‘사전 설계(Pre-design)’에 집중해야 한다.



In an environment using a 13-year-old spouted portafilter (old La Marzocco model), physical changes inside the puck cannot be visually confirmed. Therefore, the focus must be on ""Pre-design,"" where all resistance values are determined before the water even flows.



3-1. 외벽 기초 공사 (The Foundation): 먼저 58mm V-Type 레벨툴을 사용하여 가루의 전체 수평을 잡고 평탄화한다. 

58mm V-Type 레벨툴은 깊이 10mm이다. 평탄화시 턱 아래 분쇄된 원두가 배치된다.



The Foundation: First, use a 58mm V-Type leveling tool to level and flatten the grounds. The 58mm V-Type tool has a depth of 10mm. Upon leveling, the grounds are positioned below the basket rim.



3-2. 외벽 압착 및 밀도 재배치: 핵심은 54mm V-Type 툴의 투입이다. 툴을 바스켓 정중앙에 안착시킨 후, 일정한 수직 하중을 가하며 회전한다. 

54mm V-Type 레벨툴 깊이를 12mm로 설정한다.

58mm캡과 54mm 베이스를 결합한 하이브리드 툴을 이용하여 바스켓 림에 닿을때까지 누른다.  

하이브리드 툴은 상단캡이 가이드 역할을 수행함으로써 숙련도와 상관없이 기계적으로 정중앙을 압착할 수 있다.  



누른 압력 그대로 90도로 2회전(바스캣 내부 360도) 시킨다. 

양날(Double-blade) 구조 특성상 90도 2회전만으로 바스켓내부 360도 전 영역에 걸쳐 밀도 재배치가 완료된다.

일정한 속도를 유지하며 회전시킴으로써 원두 가루가 V-날개를 따라 외벽으로 고르게 재배치되도록 유도한다.



Peripheral Compression & Density Redistribution: The core of this method lies in the introduction of the 54mm V-Type tool. After seating the tool at the exact center of the basket, rotate it while applying a consistent vertical load. Set the depth of the 54mm V-Type tool to 12mm. Using a hybrid tool—a combination of a 58mm cap and a 54mm base—press down until the cap makes full contact with the basket rim. The upper cap acts as a mechanical guide, allowing any user to engage the center consistently, regardless of their skill level.



While maintaining pressure, perform two 90-degree rotations (totaling 180° of physical movement). Due to the double-blade design, this physical 180-degree turn completes a full 360-degree density redistribution within the basket. Maintaining a constant speed ensures that the grounds are evenly redistributed toward the outer walls along the V-wings.



3-3. 58mm 툴로 1회전 상단부 마무리. 

54mm 툴 회전으로 인해 턱 위로 올라온 가루들을 훑어주며 마무리하는 단계다. 



Finishing: Finalizing the Top Surface with the 58mm Tool. This step involves a final rotation with the 58mm tool to sweep and integrate the coffee grounds that were pushed upward toward the rim during the 54mm tool's rotation.



3-4. 물리적 메커니즘: 라마르조꼬형 바스켓처럼 하단으로 갈수록 좁아지는 테이퍼드(Tapered) 구조는 58mm 툴이 닿지 못하는 사각지대를 가지고 있다. 

54mm 베이스는 이 좁아지는 구간을 따라 침투한다. 

V형 날개는 가루를 측면으로 투사하여 외벽 밀착력을 극대화한다.



Physical Mechanism: Tapered structures that narrow toward the bottom, like La Marzocco-style baskets, have ""dead zones"" that 58mm tools cannot reach. The 54mm base penetrates deep into this narrowing section. The V-shaped wings project the powder laterally, maximizing adhesion to the outer walls where 58mm tools typically fail.



3-5. 설계의 목적

이 기법의 제안은 단순하다. 58mm 툴과 54mm 툴의 결합으로 중앙과 바닥에 밀도를 높여주고 브이툴을 이용하여 외벽을 보강함으로써 엣지 채널링을 보완하는데 목적이 있다. 



Objective: The premise is simple. By combining 58mm and 54mm tools, the D.G.M increases density at the core and bottom while reinforcing the perimeter using V-wings to physically neutralize edge channeling.



4. 하이브리드 레벨툴 제작 가이드 (Technical Guide: Building the D.G.M Tool)

준비물: 동일 브랜드의 58mm 마카롱형 레벨툴 2개, 54mm 1개. (나사산 호환을 위해 반드시 동일 브랜드 제품 권장)

제   작: 58mm 툴의 상단 캡(Cap)을 분리하여, 54mm 툴의 베이스(Base)와 결합.

원   리: 58mm 캡은 바스켓 림에 걸리는 \*\*'스토퍼(Stopper)'\*\*이자 '센터 가이드' 역할을 수행하며, 54mm 베이스는 바스켓 하단 좁은 구간까지 깊숙이 침투하여 \*\*'코어 밀도'\*\*를 완성.

세   팅: 58mm 오리지널 툴은 10mm 깊이로, 하이브리드 툴은 12mm 깊이로 세팅하여 물리적 하방 압력을 상수화.



To implement this method, you don't need expensive custom equipment. You can build a high-precision system using off-the-shelf components.



Materials   : Prepare two 58mm Macaron-style leveling tools and one 54mm Macaron-style leveling tool from the same brand. (Same brand is highly recommended to ensure thread compatibility.)

Assembly  : Detach the upper cap from one of the 58mm tools and combine it with the base of the 54mm tool.

Principle   : The 58mm cap acts as a 'Stopper' and a 'Center Guide' that sits on the basket rim, while the 54mm base penetrates deep into the narrow bottom section of the basket to establish the 'Core Density.'

Calibration: Set the original 58mm tool to a depth of 10mm and the hybrid tool to a depth of 12mm to turn the physical downward pressure into a constant.



5. 추출형태 관찰

5. Observation of Extraction Patterns



회전수에 따른 추출시간의 변화(Variation in Extraction Time by Rotation Count)



58mm V툴 레벨링 + C커브 탬퍼  조합 19g 사용 

추출량 : 크레마 포함 30ml 추출시간 14-15초



54mm 90도 2회전(내부 360도) 19g 

추출량: 크레마 포함 30ml (타겟 추출) 추출시간 22-24초



54mm 90도 4회전(내부 720도) 19g 사용  

추출량: 크레마 포함 30ml (저항 과다) 추출시간 40-45초



Case A: Traditional Method

Setup: 58mm V-Type Leveling Tool + C-Curve Tamper (19g Dose)

Yield: 30ml (incl. crema) / Extraction Time: 14–15s



Case B: D.G.M (2 Rotations / 360° Internal Coverage)

Setup: 54mm Hybrid Tool (19g Dose)

Yield: 30ml (Target) / Extraction Time: 22–24s



Case C: D.G.M (4 Rotations / 720° Internal Coverage)

Setup: 54mm Hybrid Tool (19g Dose)

Yield: 30ml (Excessive Resistance) / Extraction Time: 40–45s



6. 결론 : 추출은 밀도이며 설계된 시스템은 배신하지 않는다. 

6. Conclusion: Extraction is Density; Designed Systems Do Not Betray



   도징량 : 입력값이다. 도징컵을 통해 상수로 수렴한다. 

   볶음도 : 입력값이다. 때문에 볶음도는 시스템이 정상 작동한다면 상수로 수렴한다.    

   레벨링/ 템핑: 이종규격틀로 인해 상수로 수렴한다. 하이브리드툴이 바스켓 림에 닿음으로서 하방압력은 12mm로 강제된다. 보디빌더라도 더 못 누르고 초보자라고 덜 누를수 없다. 



   이제 남은것은 분쇄도 하나뿐이다. 



   이제 시스템은 갖추졌다. 이 시스템 위에 어떤 맛을 그릴지는 사용자들의 몫이다. 어떤 맛의 그림을 그리겠는가? 그러려면 타겟 추출량과 추출 시간도 변해야 되겠지?

   

Dose: An input value. It converges into a constant through the use of a dosing cup.

Roast Level: An input value. Therefore, if the system operates correctly, the roast level converges into a constant.

Leveling/Tamping: Converges into a constant due to the multi-spec tools. As the hybrid tool hits the basket rim, the downward pressure is force-locked at 12mm. A bodybuilder cannot push more, and a beginner cannot push less.



Now, only one variable remains: Grind Size.



The system is now ready. What kind of flavor profile you paint on this canvas is entirely up to the user. What masterpiece will you create? To achieve that, your target yield and extraction time must change as well, right?



7. \[부록: 미완의 확신 – VST에 대하여\]

7. \[Appendix: Incomplete Conviction – Regarding VST\]

 

애석하게도 필자의 작업실에는 VST 바스켓이 없다. 13년 된 낡은 장비가 내가 마주한 현실이다. 

따라서 누군가 ""이 기법이 VST에서도 통하겠는가?""라고 묻는다면, 나의 대답은 이렇다.



""가능할 것으로 본다. 다만, 실증하지 못했기에 주장하지 않을 뿐이다.""



물리적 법칙은 도구를 가리지 않는다. VST의 극단적인 추출 속도를 제어하는 데 있어 D.G.M은 강력한 브레이크가 될 것이다. 58mm 바스켓이라면 55mm 이하의 베이스면 가능할 것으로 본다.



Regrettably, there is no VST basket in my workshop. 13-year-old equipment is my reality. Therefore, if someone asks, ""Will this work on a VST?"", my answer is: ""I believe so. However, I won't claim it as fact since I haven't proven it yet."" Physical laws do not discriminate. D.G.M will serve as a powerful brake for VST's high flow rates. For 58mm baskets, I believe any base under 55mm will work.



8. 나의 실사용 사례

\[등속 회전 팁 추가\] 만약 등속 회전이 어렵다면, 캡이 림에 닿게 누른 후 손목을 미리 원하는 각도만큼 돌려놓고 그냥 풀어라. 

억지로 돌리는 것보다 손목을 원상태로 '푸는' 동작에서 의외로 훨씬 일정한 등속 회전이 만들어진다.



Tip for Constant Rotational Speed: > If you find it difficult to maintain a constant speed while rotating, try this: After pressing down until the cap makes full contact with the rim, pre-rotate (twist) your wrist to your desired starting angle first. Then, simply ""release"" your wrist back to its natural position. You will find that ""releasing"" the tension allows for a much more consistent and constant rotational speed than trying to force a rotation.



9. 마치며



이 시스템은 ""완벽한 한 잔""을 만들기 위한 시스템이 아니다. ""버리지 않을 한 잔""을 만들기 위한 시스템이다. 

문제가 발생했을 때, 이 시스템은 즉각적이고 논리적인 대처를 가능하게 할 것이다. 당신은 더 이상 추측할 필요가 없다.  설계된 시스템을 조정할 뿐이다. 본고의 목표는 추출을 ""운과 노동""의 영역에서 ""지속 가능한 관리와 즉각적 수정""의 영역으로 전환하는 것이다. 



이종 규격 틀의 사용은 중앙과 하방에 의도된 저항을 형성하고 측면을 보강함으로써 엣지 채널링 보강과 이로인해 중앙으로 채널링 즉 의도된 물길을 만드는 것을 목표로 하였다. 



이전 보고서는 54mm툴을 15mm 깊이로 넣으며 하방과 중앙에 강력한 코어를 만드는 것을 전제로 쓰였던 보고서라 논리적 모순과 물리학적 오류를 범했다. 수정본에서는 이를 완전히 들어내 이 기법을 만들며 관찰된 형상들을 기준으로 수정하였다. 



VST의 가는 분쇄도에서 올수 있는 부정적인 맛의 추출과 엣지 채널링의 위험도 어느정도 커버할수 있다고 보는 것은 이런 이유다. 



""추출은 밀도다""라는 전제에 채널링 유도기법(D.G.M.)시스템을 제언한다. 적용은 각자의 몫이다. 숫자에 매몰되지 말고 시스템을 이해하며, 더 많은 창의적 파생이 나오기를 진심으로 기대한다.



This system is not designed to chase the elusive ""God Shot."" Rather, it is a system built to ensure ""a cup that never fails.""

When a problem arises, this system enables an immediate and logical response. You no longer need to rely on guesswork or intuition. You simply calibrate a pre-designed system. The ultimate goal of this paper is to shift espresso extraction from the realm of ""luck and labor"" to the domain of ""sustainable management and instantaneous correction.""



The use of multi-spec tools is strategically intended to establish a deliberate resistance at the core and bottom of the puck while reinforcing the perimeter. This physically neutralizes edge channeling and, in doing so, guides the water toward the center—creating an ""intended channel"" for the flow.



Previous reports assumed a 15mm depth for the 54mm tool to create a high-density core, which led to logical inconsistencies and physical errors. In this revised version, those elements have been entirely removed and replaced with observations based on the actual phenomena witnessed during the development of this method. 



This is why I believe D.G.M. can mitigate the risks of edge channeling and the unpleasant flavors often associated with the extremely fine grind sizes required for VST baskets.



Under the grand premise that ""Extraction is Density,"" I propose the Density Guiding Method (D.G.M.). Its application now lies with each individual practitioner. I sincerely hope that you do not become enslaved by mere numbers, but instead understand the underlying system to inspire further creative derivatives and evolutions.

reboot monitor and checks the cameras and sees springtrap in the corner of one of the cameras mike then toggles the vent cam monitor and sees he can seal one if the vents he then swithes back to the main cams but phantom bb appears on the cams then apears in the office and jumpscares mike who now us in panic he then sees phantom chica who also jumpscares him mike reboots the ventilation then he stops panicking he decides to go to the room where springtrap ison the way he spots phantom puppet in the hallway but covers his eyes before he can jumpscare him mike arrives where springtrap is mike is curious what he even is mike notices then the ventilation is offline again and goes back to the office and sees phantom mangle in the vents which she jumoscares him after that mike reboots the ventilation 6 am then hits and as mike is about to leave but then he hears loud footsteps then springtrap appears from the shadows and rushes for mike who gets out just in time mike then goes home for the night springtrap watches him from a window saying and it begins again mike we cut to a flash back of fredbears family diner where we see the crying child being bullied by micheal and his friends then who brings the cryng child up to fredbear sticks him in his mouththen fredbear bites the child killing him jack then snaps Michael back to reality where they are at Williams house where they go into Williams workshop micheal spots a locked room which jack opens with the key where they see the funtime amatronics jack explains they were something William worked on after the divorce jack explains that the funtime amatronics have the ability to snatch kids themselves Micheal says that they will come in handy but wonders where to use them jack then shows micheal a poster for fazbears fright which suggests they can use them there bb then comes in tells them they have a visitor which is vanny who says hello brother then vanny takes off the mask to reveal vanessa which micheal is glad to see the she tells him thats actually Charlotte possessing her micheal is genuinely suprised by this vanny explains after Michael fleed from mikes house she took over vanessas mind Michael guesses shes her to kill them but she says shes willing to work with them as long as they help her kill the adults Michael and jack agree to Charlottes offer we cut back mike at Jeremiah house where he sees plushtrap and lefty watching tv wihile eating popcorn lefty offers mike some but he says no thank you Jeremiah notices mike is back and tells him the doctor is on the phone the doctor tells him to come to hospital eehich he explains to mike that abby is healing from injury but will still be out for a while the doctor says that abby has a visitor which is the blonde boy from the second movie which we find out hes gregory mike tells gregory abby will be okay mike asks gregory where hes parents are but as soon as he turns gregory is gone mike confused by this tells abby whiles she alseep that she'll be okay then leave we cut to the next night at fazbears fright where Mike notices coffee on his desk but he ingores him then sees springtrap standing in the camera mike notices the phone call saying that they forget to mention they found a real one which they are referring to springtrap atempts toget into the office by climbing threw a vent but mike seals it before he can get threw he sees phantom freddy walking threw the hallway who then teleports into the office and jumpscares him mike reboots the ventilation because of this when he checks the cameras again he sees springtrap getting close mike accidentally presses the audio button and sends springtrap back with the bb noise as hes releif he seed phantom foxy but before he can jumpscare him mike looks away and phantom foxy leaves then the cameras break and Mike reboots them when they go back online he can find springtrap but then mike spots him at the window but then 6am hits and springtrap leaves saying see you tomorrow mike gets more confused on who springtrap is he goes back to Jeremiahs house where hes played chess with lefty mike thrn asks plushtrap on if he might know who springtrap is plushtrap says that the only rabbit animatronics fazbear entertainment made were just bonnies and the yellow rabbit plushtrap says that it could the yellow rabbit buy mike says springtrap is green so it couldnt be him plushtrap says that the springlock suits fur was able to rot over the years so its possible mike wonders if it could possibly be William we then cut to Michael jack bb and vanny who turn on the funtime amatronics first baby then funtime freddy then ballora then funtime foxy vanny suggests before they put them in fazbears fright they use them to attack mike bb sides with vanny on the plan Michael and jack both agree they should get rid of mike speaking of which we cut back to getting a call from atsate people asking if his gonn take his stuff with him before he moves Mike says he'll get on it right away Jeremiah asks where hes going mike says he'll be back lefty then offers Jeremiah a apple but then plushtrap snatches it and eats it and says it iiiiiisss actually delicious im gonna have another one mike thrn goes back to hes old house boxing up hes and abbys stuff while wondering where the animatronics went he then notices the animatronics and Cassidy sitting at the table mike is genially suprised since he thought he was moving on cassidy explains that with Michael causing death and william back they couldnt move on to heaven yet mike explains what happened at faz fest and abby being injured and Micheal having the help of bb and the withereds Cassidy states now that they charged the animatronics bodies they can help find Michael  but they some more time to fuly charge up the suits Cassidy then tells mike to come back tomorrow mike promises he'll come back tomorrow and leaves also freddy waves him goodbye as mike is about to get into his car bb shows up and knocks him out he then wakes up in a office in a unknown location Michael then talks on the intercom telling him how bb kidnapped him and brought him here he then tells mike he would watch the cameras if he was him and then mike sees the funtimes on the cams he spots ballora coming down the hallway but he closes the door before she can get in Michael then says good luck funtime freddy then comes from the hallway opposite of the one ballora came from he says hello to mike and tells bonbon to go get him he then throws bonbon at mike but he closes the door before bonbon could get in but then funtime foxy sprints down the other hallway quick but mike closes the door before he could get in baby talks to mike over the coms telling him she dosnt recognise him and that mike is has reflects but curious what those reflects can do when pushed to the limit then the next couple minutes mike survives against the funtimes but then he runs out of power baby then shows up behind him about to kill him but baby mysteriously turns off and mike faints he then wakes up in a van with the classics Cassidy states that freddy and foxy got mike out of there before he died he then says theyre going fazbears fright to confront springtrap cassidy says they'll get some tools to defeat him while mike keeps him occupied for a while mike agrees to the plan then it cuts to mike in fazbears fright keeping springtrap at bay while getting jumpscare by phantom foxy then phantom bb and then phantom freddy but before springtrap could get in he reboots the ventilation and tries to lures springtrap away with the bb noise but the audio needs to be rebooted but as it was done rebooting springtrap got into the office and says too slow mr i cant work nights Mike finally realises that springtrap is William springtrap cconfirms this and says i always come back mike then asks why did he kill Garrett he says that mikes dad replaced him as henrys business partner so he killed Garrett as revenge and he killed the five kids and Charlotte as revenge against Henry and another reason mike asks how is he still alive springtrap says besides always coming back he had a feeling he would fuse with the suit and he says he has become springtrap and this time hes gonna kill him mike quickly crawls into the vent and Springtrap chases him in it mike ends up at the other side of the building and then springtrap then chases him to the exit mike tries to open the door but is unsuccessful but then smells something buring springtrap also notices this then fazbears fright catches on fire but springtrap ingores it and proceeds to try to kill mike but then gets crushed by debre as mike exits the building springtrap yells that this isnt over and he'll come back again and that he always does mike makes his way to the exit of coffee world the animatronics show up and cassidy states that they were the ones that started the fire they say theyre gonna go into hiding now especially since Michael is still out there cassidy says they'll be in touch and to tell abby they said hye Mike says he will and the animatronics drive off mike then goes back Jeremiahs house where him lefty and plushtrap are watching tv Jeremiah says to mike that the hospital called and said abby is awake knowing this mike rushes over to the hospital and hugs abby and soon as he sees her we cut to a week later where we see mike and abby now in their new house but living with plushtrap and lefty mike says that breakfest is ready and abby comes aswell as plushtrap mike asks plushtrap if he's just gonna live here now plushtrap replies by saying if i want to stay then I'll shall mike does plushtrap his eggs abby then says so they'll still here just in hiding mike says yes saying they might actually visit them sometime which makes abby happy mike also states they're not probably gonna see vanessa again cause of reasons but he says who know maybe things will change after breakfast mike sees lefty on the couch and talks to him lefty says if he'll ever find the puppet and if he'll grant henrys dying wish mike conforts him by saying he'll help him find Charlotte lefty asks abby if they want to watch tv which they do but as the camera zooms out we see Gregory watching through the window then we see him go to a rundown house where see him talking eith mysterious figure the stranger asks if gregory accepts hes offer Gregory tells him thst he does the mysterious figure then says excellent then we know what to do first find Michael then we see the stranger is fredbear which is possessed by the

This is not a coffee workshop. No lectures, no gear flexing, no “learn pour-over in 60 minutes” promise.

The idea is simple: a small group (15–20 people), meeting once a week for four weeks at the same café, at the same time. Coffee is the medium, not the hero. The real point is returning to the same place with the same people and letting conversations build naturally.

There would be some light structure — a short story here, a tasting prompt there — but no teaching, no performance. Just calm, intentional time around coffee with people who enjoy it but don’t want to turn it into a personality.

You’d pay for the full four sessions upfront (roughly the cost of a nice dinner out), which is really a commitment to showing up, not “learning skills.”

What I’m trying to understand is this:

	•	Does this feel meaningful or unnecessary?

	•	Would you personally pay for something like this, or does it feel indulgent / pretentious?

	•	What would make this feel worth returning to week after week?

1. 서론: 커피는 숙련된 노동인가, 설계된 시스템인가?

에스프레소 추출에서 ‘채널링’은 바리스타의 숙명처럼 여겨져 왔다. 

많은 이들이 탬핑의 강도나 분쇄도 조절이라는 개인의 숙련도에 의지해 이 문제를 해결하려 하지만, 인간의 감각은 매 순간 변수 앞에 노출된다. 

지난 15년간 현장에서 연구해온 결론은 명확하다. 커피는 숙련된 노동이 아닌, 철저히 계산된 밀도 시스템에 의해 추출되어야 한다.

전통적 추출 이론에서 볶음도, 도징량, 분쇄도, 레벨링, 템핑은 모두 변수다. 이를 부정하는 사람은 없을 것이다. 

추출은 밀도라는 대전제 아래 채널링 유도 기법을 통하여 하나씩 상수화하여 결국 분쇄도 하나만을 남길 것이다. 

앞으로 추출은 분쇄도 하나만을 조절하는 방법으로 바뀔 것이다. 억지 같은가? 



1. Introduction: Skilled Labor or Designed System?

In espresso extraction, ""channeling"" has long been regarded as the inevitable fate of a barista. Many attempt to solve this by relying on individual skills, such as tamping pressure or grind adjustment, but human senses are constantly exposed to variables. After 15 years of field research, my conclusion is clear: Extraction must transcend the limitations of manual labor and become a strictly calculated system of density. In this paper, I introduce the 'Density Guiding Method (D.G.M)', which actively designs an internal density map by combining basket geometry with multi-spec tools.



The hybrid tool is designed to consolidate core and bottom density while reinforcing the perimeter, thereby physically neutralizing edge channeling through structural redistribution.



In traditional extraction theory, roast level, dose, grind size, leveling, and tamping are all variables. No one would deny this. Under the grand premise that ""Extraction is Density,"" D.G.M will Systematically stabilize these variables into constants, eventually leaving only the grind size. In the future, extraction will shift toward a method where only the grind size is adjusted. Does that sound far-fetched?



2. 실험 및 추출 조건

Experimental and Extraction Conditions



볶음도: 중볶음 (Roast Level: Medium Roast)



도징량: 19g - 20g (Dose: 19g - 20g)



추출 타겟: 리스트레또(Ristretto) 투샷, 스파웃 15ml + 15ml 크레마 포함 30ml (Target: Double Ristretto (Spouted: 15ml + 15ml / Total 30ml including crema)



표준 추출 시간: 20초 \~ 24초 (Standard Extraction Time: 20s \~ 24s)



분쇄도: 위 범위를 충족하는 범위 내 (Grind Size: Within the range that satisfies the above parameters)



3. 본론: 테이퍼드 구조를 장악하는 ‘이종 규격 설계’

3. Main Body: ""Multi-Spec Design"" Dominating Tapered Structures



13년 된 스파웃(Spout) 포터필터(라마르조꼬 구형 포타필터)를 사용하는 환경에서는 퍽 내부의 물리적 변화를 시각적으로 확인할 수 없다. 

따라서 물이 흐르기 전 이미 모든 저항값이 결정되는 ‘사전 설계(Pre-design)’에 집중해야 한다.



In an environment using a 13-year-old spouted portafilter (old La Marzocco model), physical changes inside the puck cannot be visually confirmed. Therefore, the focus must be on ""Pre-design,"" where all resistance values are determined before the water even flows.



3-1. 외벽 기초 공사 (The Foundation): 먼저 58mm V-Type 레벨툴을 사용하여 가루의 전체 수평을 잡고 평탄화한다. 

58mm V-Type 레벨툴은 깊이 10mm이다. 평탄화시 턱 아래 분쇄된 원두가 배치된다.



The Foundation: First, use a 58mm V-Type leveling tool to level and flatten the grounds. The 58mm V-Type tool has a depth of 10mm. Upon leveling, the grounds are positioned below the basket rim.



3-2. 외벽 압착 및 밀도 재배치: 핵심은 54mm V-Type 툴의 투입이다. 툴을 바스켓 정중앙에 안착시킨 후, 일정한 수직 하중을 가하며 회전한다. 

54mm V-Type 레벨툴 깊이를 12mm로 설정한다.

58mm캡과 54mm 베이스를 결합한 하이브리드 툴을 이용하여 바스켓 림에 닿을때까지 누른다.  

하이브리드 툴은 상단캡이 가이드 역할을 수행함으로써 숙련도와 상관없이 기계적으로 정중앙을 압착할 수 있다.  



누른 압력 그대로 90도로 2회전(바스캣 내부 360도) 시킨다. 

양날(Double-blade) 구조 특성상 90도 2회전만으로 바스켓내부 360도 전 영역에 걸쳐 밀도 재배치가 완료된다.

일정한 속도를 유지하며 회전시킴으로써 원두 가루가 V-날개를 따라 외벽으로 고르게 재배치되도록 유도한다.



Peripheral Compression & Density Redistribution: The core of this method lies in the introduction of the 54mm V-Type tool. After seating the tool at the exact center of the basket, rotate it while applying a consistent vertical load. Set the depth of the 54mm V-Type tool to 12mm. Using a hybrid tool—a combination of a 58mm cap and a 54mm base—press down until the cap makes full contact with the basket rim. The upper cap acts as a mechanical guide, allowing any user to engage the center consistently, regardless of their skill level.



While maintaining pressure, perform two 90-degree rotations (totaling 180° of physical movement). Due to the double-blade design, this physical 180-degree turn completes a full 360-degree density redistribution within the basket. Maintaining a constant speed ensures that the grounds are evenly redistributed toward the outer walls along the V-wings.



3-3. 58mm 툴로 1회전 상단부 마무리. 

54mm 툴 회전으로 인해 턱 위로 올라온 가루들을 훑어주며 마무리하는 단계다. 



Finishing: Finalizing the Top Surface with the 58mm Tool. This step involves a final rotation with the 58mm tool to sweep and integrate the coffee grounds that were pushed upward toward the rim during the 54mm tool's rotation.



3-4. 물리적 메커니즘: 라마르조꼬형 바스켓처럼 하단으로 갈수록 좁아지는 테이퍼드(Tapered) 구조는 58mm 툴이 닿지 못하는 사각지대를 가지고 있다. 

54mm 베이스는 이 좁아지는 구간을 따라 침투한다. 

V형 날개는 가루를 측면으로 투사하여 외벽 밀착력을 극대화한다.



Physical Mechanism: Tapered structures that narrow toward the bottom, like La Marzocco-style baskets, have ""dead zones"" that 58mm tools cannot reach. The 54mm base penetrates deep into this narrowing section. The V-shaped wings project the powder laterally, maximizing adhesion to the outer walls where 58mm tools typically fail.



3-5. 설계의 목적

이 기법의 제안은 단순하다. 58mm 툴과 54mm 툴의 결합으로 중앙과 바닥에 밀도를 높여주고 브이툴을 이용하여 외벽을 보강함으로써 엣지 채널링을 보완하는데 목적이 있다. 



Objective: The premise is simple. By combining 58mm and 54mm tools, the D.G.M increases density at the core and bottom while reinforcing the perimeter using V-wings to physically neutralize edge channeling.



4. 하이브리드 레벨툴 제작 가이드 (Technical Guide: Building the D.G.M Tool)

준비물: 동일 브랜드의 58mm 마카롱형 레벨툴 2개, 54mm 1개. (나사산 호환을 위해 반드시 동일 브랜드 제품 권장)

제   작: 58mm 툴의 상단 캡(Cap)을 분리하여, 54mm 툴의 베이스(Base)와 결합.

원   리: 58mm 캡은 바스켓 림에 걸리는 \*\*'스토퍼(Stopper)'\*\*이자 '센터 가이드' 역할을 수행하며, 54mm 베이스는 바스켓 하단 좁은 구간까지 깊숙이 침투하여 \*\*'코어 밀도'\*\*를 완성.

세   팅: 58mm 오리지널 툴은 10mm 깊이로, 하이브리드 툴은 12mm 깊이로 세팅하여 물리적 하방 압력을 상수화.



To implement this method, you don't need expensive custom equipment. You can build a high-precision system using off-the-shelf components.



Materials   : Prepare two 58mm Macaron-style leveling tools and one 54mm Macaron-style leveling tool from the same brand. (Same brand is highly recommended to ensure thread compatibility.)

Assembly  : Detach the upper cap from one of the 58mm tools and combine it with the base of the 54mm tool.

Principle   : The 58mm cap acts as a 'Stopper' and a 'Center Guide' that sits on the basket rim, while the 54mm base penetrates deep into the narrow bottom section of the basket to establish the 'Core Density.'

Calibration: Set the original 58mm tool to a depth of 10mm and the hybrid tool to a depth of 12mm to turn the physical downward pressure into a constant.



5. 추출형태 관찰

5. Observation of Extraction Patterns



회전수에 따른 추출시간의 변화(Variation in Extraction Time by Rotation Count)



58mm V툴 레벨링 + C커브 탬퍼  조합 19g 사용 

추출량 : 크레마 포함 30ml 추출시간 14-15초



54mm 90도 2회전(내부 360도) 19g 

추출량: 크레마 포함 30ml (타겟 추출) 추출시간 22-24초



54mm 90도 4회전(내부 720도) 19g 사용  

추출량: 크레마 포함 30ml (저항 과다) 추출시간 40-45초



Case A: Traditional Method

Setup: 58mm V-Type Leveling Tool + C-Curve Tamper (19g Dose)

Yield: 30ml (incl. crema) / Extraction Time: 14–15s



Case B: D.G.M (2 Rotations / 360° Internal Coverage)

Setup: 54mm Hybrid Tool (19g Dose)

Yield: 30ml (Target) / Extraction Time: 22–24s



Case C: D.G.M (4 Rotations / 720° Internal Coverage)

Setup: 54mm Hybrid Tool (19g Dose)

Yield: 30ml (Excessive Resistance) / Extraction Time: 40–45s



6. 결론 : 추출은 밀도이며 설계된 시스템은 배신하지 않는다. 

6. Conclusion: Extraction is Density; Designed Systems Do Not Betray



   도징량 : 입력값이다. 도징컵을 통해 상수로 수렴한다. 

   볶음도 : 입력값이다. 때문에 볶음도는 시스템이 정상 작동한다면 상수로 수렴한다.    

   레벨링/ 템핑: 이종규격틀로 인해 상수로 수렴한다. 하이브리드툴이 바스켓 림에 닿음으로서 하방압력은 12mm로 강제된다. 보디빌더라도 더 못 누르고 초보자라고 덜 누를수 없다. 



   이제 남은것은 분쇄도 하나뿐이다. 



   이제 시스템은 갖추졌다. 이 시스템 위에 어떤 맛을 그릴지는 사용자들의 몫이다. 어떤 맛의 그림을 그리겠는가? 그러려면 타겟 추출량과 추출 시간도 변해야 되겠지?

   

Dose: An input value. It converges into a constant through the use of a dosing cup.

Roast Level: An input value. Therefore, if the system operates correctly, the roast level converges into a constant.

Leveling/Tamping: Converges into a constant due to the multi-spec tools. As the hybrid tool hits the basket rim, the downward pressure is force-locked at 12mm. A bodybuilder cannot push more, and a beginner cannot push less.



Now, only one variable remains: Grind Size.



The system is now ready. What kind of flavor profile you paint on this canvas is entirely up to the user. What masterpiece will you create? To achieve that, your target yield and extraction time must change as well, right?



7. \[부록: 미완의 확신 – VST에 대하여\]

7. \[Appendix: Incomplete Conviction – Regarding VST\]

 

애석하게도 필자의 작업실에는 VST 바스켓이 없다. 13년 된 낡은 장비가 내가 마주한 현실이다. 

따라서 누군가 ""이 기법이 VST에서도 통하겠는가?""라고 묻는다면, 나의 대답은 이렇다.



""가능할 것으로 본다. 다만, 실증하지 못했기에 주장하지 않을 뿐이다.""



물리적 법칙은 도구를 가리지 않는다. VST의 극단적인 추출 속도를 제어하는 데 있어 D.G.M은 강력한 브레이크가 될 것이다. 58mm 바스켓이라면 55mm 이하의 베이스면 가능할 것으로 본다.



Regrettably, there is no VST basket in my workshop. 13-year-old equipment is my reality. Therefore, if someone asks, ""Will this work on a VST?"", my answer is: ""I believe so. However, I won't claim it as fact since I haven't proven it yet."" Physical laws do not discriminate. D.G.M will serve as a powerful brake for VST's high flow rates. For 58mm baskets, I believe any base under 55mm will work.



8. 나의 실사용 사례

\[등속 회전 팁 추가\] 만약 등속 회전이 어렵다면, 캡이 림에 닿게 누른 후 손목을 미리 원하는 각도만큼 돌려놓고 그냥 풀어라. 

억지로 돌리는 것보다 손목을 원상태로 '푸는' 동작에서 의외로 훨씬 일정한 등속 회전이 만들어진다.



Tip for Constant Rotational Speed: > If you find it difficult to maintain a constant speed while rotating, try this: After pressing down until the cap makes full contact with the rim, pre-rotate (twist) your wrist to your desired starting angle first. Then, simply ""release"" your wrist back to its natural position. You will find that ""releasing"" the tension allows for a much more consistent and constant rotational speed than trying to force a rotation.



9. 마치며



이 시스템은 ""완벽한 한 잔""을 만들기 위한 시스템이 아니다. ""버리지 않을 한 잔""을 만들기 위한 시스템이다. 

문제가 발생했을 때, 이 시스템은 즉각적이고 논리적인 대처를 가능하게 할 것이다. 당신은 더 이상 추측할 필요가 없다.  설계된 시스템을 조정할 뿐이다. 본고의 목표는 추출을 ""운과 노동""의 영역에서 ""지속 가능한 관리와 즉각적 수정""의 영역으로 전환하는 것이다. 



이종 규격 틀의 사용은 중앙과 하방에 의도된 저항을 형성하고 측면을 보강함으로써 엣지 채널링 보강과 이로인해 중앙으로 채널링 즉 의도된 물길을 만드는 것을 목표로 하였다. 



이전 보고서는 54mm툴을 15mm 깊이로 넣으며 하방과 중앙에 강력한 코어를 만드는 것을 전제로 쓰였던 보고서라 논리적 모순과 물리학적 오류를 범했다. 수정본에서는 이를 완전히 들어내 이 기법을 만들며 관찰된 형상들을 기준으로 수정하였다. 



VST의 가는 분쇄도에서 올수 있는 부정적인 맛의 추출과 엣지 채널링의 위험도 어느정도 커버할수 있다고 보는 것은 이런 이유다. 



""추출은 밀도다""라는 전제에 채널링 유도기법(D.G.M.)시스템을 제언한다. 적용은 각자의 몫이다. 숫자에 매몰되지 말고 시스템을 이해하며, 더 많은 창의적 파생이 나오기를 진심으로 기대한다.



This system is not designed to chase the elusive ""God Shot."" Rather, it is a system built to ensure ""a cup that never fails.""

When a problem arises, this system enables an immediate and logical response. You no longer need to rely on guesswork or intuition. You simply calibrate a pre-designed system. The ultimate goal of this paper is to shift espresso extraction from the realm of ""luck and labor"" to the domain of ""sustainable management and instantaneous correction.""



The use of multi-spec tools is strategically intended to establish a deliberate resistance at the core and bottom of the puck while reinforcing the perimeter. This physically neutralizes edge channeling and, in doing so, guides the water toward the center—creating an ""intended channel"" for the flow.



Previous reports assumed a 15mm depth for the 54mm tool to create a high-density core, which led to logical inconsistencies and physical errors. In this revised version, those elements have been entirely removed and replaced with observations based on the actual phenomena witnessed during the development of this method. 



This is why I believe D.G.M. can mitigate the risks of edge channeling and the unpleasant flavors often associated with the extremely fine grind sizes required for VST baskets.



Under the grand premise that ""Extraction is Density,"" I propose the Density Guiding Method (D.G.M.). Its application now lies with each individual practitioner. I sincerely hope that you do not become enslaved by mere numbers, but instead understand the underlying system to inspire further creative derivatives and evolutions.

Normalerweise trifft man third wave Cafés immer in größeren Städten an mit größerer Potentieller Kundschaft. 

Der Ort liegt rund 3-4km von einer Kleinstadt mit 15K Einwohnern entfern. In dem Ort selbst wohnen etwa 14k (zählt offiziell dennoch als Ort / Gemeinde) sowie im näheren Umkreis von 5km kommt man auf 40-45K Einwohner. 

Vielleicht bin ich auch zu Kaffee-Verliebt aber wie sehr würde ich mir so ein Café wünschen, wo Menschen zusammenkommen, guten Kaffee trinken, Kuchen essen und eine gute Zeit haben - außerhalb einer Stadt. 

Ist das nur mein Gedanke oder wäre sowas tatsächlich geil? 

Mein Gedanke ist folgender: 

Wir haben ein relativ großes Grundstück mit einem alten Fachwerkhaus (muss kernsaniert werden) und gemütlichem Hof) 

Ins EG würde ich ein Kaffee (&ggf. eine Rösterei) etablieren. Darüber ggf. Praxisräume für Physiotherapie etc - da ich denke der Bedarf hierfür ist ebenfalls hoch.

Somit könnte ich das Risiko der Umbaukosten nicht nur auf das Kaffee sondern auch auf Mieteinnahmen verteilen. Für das Café selbst müsste ich dann, hingegen zu einer Stadt, keine Miete zahlen. 

Ggf. noch ein paar Informationen zur Lage:

Gerade im Sommer fahren super viele Radfahrer durch die Straße. Parkplätze gibt es direkt vor dem Grundstück wenige aber rund 200m entfernt dann einen großen Parkplatz. 

Der Hof ist wunderschön, um dort im Sommer zu sitzen. Der Fachwerk-Charakter hat zudem einen schönen Wohnzimmer-Flair. 

Glaube ihr sowas würde laufen und der Bedarf wäre da? Gerade weil hier viele bestimmt auch nicht in einer Stadt wohnen?

1qmdslb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qmdslb/aitah_for_asking_my_friend_to_step_down_as_a/,AITAH for asking my friend to step down as a bridesmaid?,"I (F30) asked my friend (F31) of almost 10 years to step down as a bridesmaid and now everything has blown up, so I need outside opinions.

After she had her son last year, our friendship shifted a lot. She became really closed off, barely texting or calling, cancelling plans last minute, and not able to catch up even for a quick coffee. I tried to be supportive, dropped off care packages, checked in, and made a real effort.

When we did start talking more again, she began making comments about me becoming a mum one day, like saying she couldn’t wait to watch me struggle or that when I thought I was ready, she’d call me every three hours and if I missed even one call, I clearly wasn’t ready to be a mum. At first I assumed these were jokes that just didn’t land well, but over time they really hurt.

I’m not great with confrontation, so I didn’t call it out and assumed maybe she was struggling herself. Around the same time, I got engaged. I’d always pictured her as a bridesmaid. Even though it took over a month of asking daily to see her (offering short coffees, being flexible, etc.), I eventually caught up with her. I checked in to make sure I hadn’t upset her in any way and asked her to be a bridesmaid. She was really excited and for about a week everything felt normal again. Then the distance and communication issues came straight back.

Plans always felt up in the air, replies were slow or non-existent, and I constantly felt anxious about the friendship, especially with a wedding coming up.

Then Christmas came around. Two days before our annual friend Christmas dinner, I found out my dad’s cancer had spread. I still went because I needed the distraction, but gave everyone a heads up that I might be a bit quiet and would arrive late. When I got there, the vibe felt awkward. At the end of the night, I privately told her what was going on with my dad so she understood why I wasn’t myself.

A few weeks later, I had an event to celebrate my 30th birthday. Friends from different parts of my life were there. She came for about an hour and left early to go home to her child, which I understood. After that, a mutual friend pulled me aside and told me she’d been saying she didn’t understand why I was so emotional about my dad since this wasn’t new and that I should have better coping skills by now. Over the next few days, other friends also reached out and told me she had made more comments at the party about how she couldn’t wait for me and my partner to have a baby because we would struggle a lot.

At that point, I felt like having her in my bridal party was putting even more strain on an already tense friendship. Even though the comments alone probably should’ve ended things, I still wanted to stay friends and thought maybe she was dealing with postpartum issues.

A few days after my birthday, she messaged asking to hang out. I said yes because I wanted to talk to her in person anyway. Her response was, “Is this you asking me to not be in the bridal party anymore? Because I get it.” I was caught off guard, but it felt like the right moment. I gently told her that I thought it was best if she stepped down as a bridesmaid. She initially took it well and said she respected my decision and would still support us on the wedding day. She also said she was only joking about the “is this you asking me to step down” message, but it didn’t feel like a joke to me. It felt like she already knew it was coming.

The next day, she messaged again saying it had “kicked in” and she couldn’t understand what horrible thing she had done to make me do this, and assumed it was because she’s a mum. I waited a few days before responding and then explained how her repeated comments about me and my partner becoming parents had hurt me, and that between that, the distance, and the constant tension, I felt this was the best choice for my mental health and for preserving the friendship.

She told me I was a bad friend and that she was only joking.

Since then, she’s told people she won’t attend my wedding, deleted photos of her son from a group chat with mutual friends but left all the photos in our private messages, which honestly feels performative to me. I’ve also since been told that some of the people in that group are now questioning attending my wedding because of how she’s framed the situation.

I’m trying to respect that she’s upset, but I honestly don’t know what else I could’ve done.

1qmdkyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LahoreSocial/comments/1qmdkyj/hypocrisy_of_a_woman/,Hypocrisy of a Woman,"After falling short of tying up a knot and being at the border line of giving up the thought of marriage, Cant recall how i landed on Reddit but gave it a try on a specific community that caters to this niche. Met a woman (like why wouldnt I) who perfectly aligned being a wife nor a lover or friend because that is not what upholds a marriage.

I was transparent to her regarding my non conventional islamic beliefs ( not atheist ) and a guy my age would ofcourse have had intimate relation in the past. Like i dont know why this stupid statement is even mentioned in rishta hunt, "" NO Haram past relationship"" Girlies growing up all my classmates have had a taste of multiple whores, atleast i am that decent one who had a consensual relationship and didnt go so cheap for sex. Real men dont buy girls and any man says he is pure is the biggest lie ever and its simply ridiculous to even mention such.

Anyways perhaps to carry on the formality. We met. Had coffee and rested on a deserted spot where i simply held her hand and it was nothing short of magical when the sun rays warmed me up and i just soaked in the moment. At my age, we are passed by the needs of this and that and a whole list and simply a presence of a woman is all u can ask for.

She realised how keen i am holding her hand and didnt back off from when i mentioned i cant quite get the angle to hold it so shw would twist the arm. Even when i waited for my  ride back home,  it was really cold and i was hesitant to pass on the chills but to my surprise she extended her hand and strangely it was warm and i was freezing.

In the morning i simply got the text that i am a wonderful guy and she had a nice time knowing and spending time with me but she couldnt find a spark nor romantic feelings during a date.

Cut to the chase the real reason was my beliefs, the hypocrisy wouldnt allow her to mention as she clearly stated its the matter between U and God and later in the conversation they mention they cant marry in Islam due to restrictions. Like woman make up your mind. The best thing she could do was to totally cut me off without a legit explanation as she know how badly she screwed up and wasnt upfront about it

Months later i saw her posting on Reddit where she got forcefully touched by a guy  for who she went on date with and didnt respect her wishes and boundaries. Well Karma is due sooner or later, to her that guy is capable of a husband nor me still owing to what this religion has programmed.

Well this is the third time i couldnt tie up the knot as Muslim woman despite falling for me wouldnt take it further.

I am inclined to know whether any woman who carries unconventional beliefs because she decided to research on her own for once and simply not go by what was fed to her faced such dillemas. Heck i even welcome divorced ones as they can relate how unfair is to forgoe the element of respect and actually feeling the need for one, Instead of Gen z and kids in there mid 20s posting for Rishtas just to gauge the market and never bothering about  a conversation to spearhead the process",0,1769329410.0,LahoreSocial,13,0.4,False

Let's connect if this fits your practice! \*Elementary school:

1was was generally observant and creative. shared crayons, played art dolls, and storytelling with friends on the bus, and made friends at recess. I defended myself once when a boy tripped me at recess, and another time when a boy kept annoying me on the bus. I played football with special-needs kids and learned small, meaningful things from them like a special tea recipe using green tea broth and lemon from one boy participated in dance, cheer, and visual arts, listened well in class, got good grades, and tended to stay on the edges of the room rather than the center.

Middle school:

1 became more of a people-pleaser. I danced and sang, let others take pictures of me, and tried to stay agreeable to avoid being bullied. I had about two close friends I genuinely cared for, but I was polite and kind to everyone even when i didn't feel deeply connected.

High school:

I struggled more with social anxiety and avoidance. I made a friend in credit-recovery class who helped me with math, but during prep rallies class, and lunch I often skipped time by hiding in the bathroom because social situations felt overwhelming. I coped by retreating into private behaviors and stimulation-watching YouTube videos, texting bots, and self-soothing-rather than engaging with peers.

College: I wanted to be a psychologist because of my self awareness and need to help others I failed because I only did the tests and participation and not the activitys Melissa has changed her routine since we last spoke l like to take care of living beings, consent, like it big or small, I like to change style, bad words, massage, perspective, close-up different forms, I like holes, I like fluids, temperature, brightness, soft - hard, emotions.Date: December 30, 2025

Dear Professional, before you hire me for my innovative designs or start treatments and plans here are some core considerations

I am writing to explain what kind of mental healthcare I need. I want clear, respectful, trauma-informed support.

1 am a bilingual creative person with experience in art, writing, translation, and UX interests. I used to be very caring with kids and animals, and I want help reconnecting with that part of myself.

My family is stressful and often crosses my boundaries. This has affected my confidence and well-being.

I think and process through creativity, symbols, and visuals. This is important for my care.

I have past diagnoses of anxiety, depression, bipolar Il, schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms, and anemia. I experience intrusive thoughts, bad sleep, low appetite, emotional numbness, repetitive actions, strong attachments, and distressing libido triggers.

I have tried many medications(Prozac,lexapro,Wellbutrin ,invega,Paxil ,hydroxyzine,vitamin c,remeron,risperol,abilify,multivitamins,tylenol etc)that made me too tired not fix anything . I now only use melatonin and vitamins.

I need:

• brain wave measure Full psychological/psychiatric assessment

• Reproductive health review

• Medication consultation

I want ongoing care that is kind, collaborative, and holistic.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Melissa PROFILE SUMMARY

I’m into football (Man United fan, yes, I’m suffering too), badminton, cycling, nature walks, motorbikes, gaming, fishing, snooker/pool/darts, guitars, and music in general. I also enjoy podcasts (true crime and mystery especially), reading, TV shows, allotment’ing, and hunting out good coffee and food spots.

My sense of humour ranges from silly to dark and cynical, and sarcasm is basically a second language.

I’m a believer that friendships should feel easy- a bit of effort from both sides, but no forcing it if it’s not happening.

Aged around eight, I learned a new word...with the sort of grasp that a dog has on a bicycle; it knows what it looks and sounds like, but really has no idea how to use it properly.

The word was ""appropriate"".

Some kids would want to show off their football skills. Not me; I was the original full on, nerdy bookworm...I simply could not wait to use my new word.

Enter Steve, Mum's first new boyfriend after she divorced my Dad six years previously. Steve seems perfectly nice, but was a little treading on eggshells as it was the first time he'd met me. I think Mum had seen him a few times at work, but this was their first proper date. Steve took a seat and Mum said ""How do you take your coffee, Steve?""

""Black"" he replied.

This is it. This is my moment to impress Mum's new boyfriend with my ever expanding vocabulary...here goes...

""That's appropriate."" I said.

To my Mum's Anglo West Indian boyfriend.
