We hit it off pretty quickly, and everything seemed great at first. She‚Äôs smart, funny, gorgeous, all the things I was looking for. But now, there‚Äôs a bit of a.... situation, and I‚Äôm honestly wondering if I messed up.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I don‚Äôt mind paying for dates. I really don‚Äôt! In the beginning, I picked up most of the tabs, which I thought was pretty normal. I wanted to make a good impression, and, you know, I like treating her. But recently, I‚Äôve started to feel like I‚Äôm the only one contributing financially. I pay for our dinners, movies, outings, and even things we pick up for her apartment when I‚Äôm over there.

She‚Äôs never offered to pay, not even once. I wasn‚Äôt expecting her to take over, but maybe offer to split the bill occasionally, or grab a coffee here and there. I don‚Äôt want this to come off the wrong way, but I feel like it‚Äôs all falling on me. I‚Äôm not exactly rolling in cash here‚ÄîI work hard, and I like being generous, but I can‚Äôt be her financial support system.

Last night, we were at a nicer restaurant (one she picked), and when the bill came, she just looked at me expectantly. I finally asked if she‚Äôd consider covering her half since I‚Äôd been paying for everything lately. She looked shocked, got super quiet, and then said I was being cheap and that ‚Äúa real man wouldn‚Äôt ask his girlfriend to pay.‚Äù I told her it‚Äôs not about being cheap; it‚Äôs about feeling like things are fair.

She accused me of ‚Äúruining the romance‚Äù and made a huge scene, storming out of the restaurant and leaving me there with the bill (again). I was embarrassed as hell and had to apologize to the waiter for the drama.

Now she‚Äôs barely speaking to me and told our mutual friends that I ‚Äúhumiliated‚Äù her in public by ‚Äúdemanding money‚Äù like some sort of cheapskate. A couple of them are saying I overreacted, and now I‚Äôm wondering if I was really in the wrong here.

She thinks I‚Äôm in the wrong for asking her to contribute, and now I‚Äôm wondering if maybe I came off too strong. I don‚Äôt want to be that guy, but I also don‚Äôt want to be taken advantage of.

For context we are both full time student working part time and paying for our own tuition. When I used to work full time, I was able to save 15K, now that I work part time, I still put away a small amount of money per month into my saving account. I always track my savings spending and adjust accordingly. In august we both looked at our finances individually and decided to stop going on dates to save money. Since then, we haven‚Äôt gone on a date expect for my birthday when he planned and paid for a weekend getaway.

Yesterday he told me he didn‚Äôt have enough money for his tuition and that the deadline was coming soon. He said he might have to take out a loan. I asked him to talk more about it since taking a loan will affect both of us in the long run (we‚Äôd like to buy a house in 2 years) he said he wanted to be careful with his words but basically said that he should had been more careful with his spending during the summer and should have said no to more things (we had a out of the country wedding to attend to and we went on a vacation during the summer) he also said that the getaway weekend was expensive. I felt like he was blaming me for his financial problem and I didn‚Äôt think it was right. I told him that I felt blamed, but that when we planned our vacations during the summer I had done a budget for the both of us and that I respected my budget, I told him that he‚Äôs the one who decided to spend more than it was intended. I also told him that we hadn‚Äôt been on a date for 2 months, but he still goes out with his friends almost every weekend. I told him he should do a budget to realize where he spends his money. 

We were both getting frustrated and it was late at night so we decided to think about it more and to talk about it later. 

I want to have suggestions on how to approach it because yes we did go on a couple of vacations during the summer but we did have a budget for both vacations and I unfortunately think that his little daily expenses (for example getting coffee everyday) and going out with his friends are more to blame than our vacations for his financial problem. I also don‚Äôt want to make him feel bad about himself, I want us to work together to get him out of financial problems. 

How would you approach this conversation without blaming each other ?

TL;DR: My (26M) boyfriend is having financial problems and I (25F) feel like his blaming me for it. I on the other hand think he doesn‚Äôt realize how much he spends daily. I need suggestions on how to talk about finances without blaming each other. ",1,1730304297.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Please check this guide for WATER ENEMA MASSAGE TIPS, which is important for when doing the double/triple post liver-flush water enemas! ","***I wrote this for the lyme disease community, and it mainly details how to do coffee enemas, and some notes on binders, herbs and such. That is not really relevant here. However, the guide is there if anyone would like to try learn how to try and do an coffee enema. But more importantly, there is an explanation on how to massage the colon when doing water enemas. This is super important to maximise the effectiveness of your water enemas, and to remove as many sneaky stones that may get stuck in the colon after a flush.***



***Hugo‚Äôs Coffee Enema Guide:***

*‚ÄúLuck Favours the Brave!‚Äù*

*The first thing I want to say before I write this, is that whatever I write in here as help, please do your own research on this stuff too, as the more you know the more you can help yourself. I will write just everything in my head that I have amassed on the topic for 4 years. Also, being a ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù topic like this, science does not favour it all. (Who can make money from this? Nobody really, patent-wise.) So, it was harder to research it, and the net had to be widened. (I am no longer a skeptic, but open to all that is logical and scientific, as long as it‚Äôs reasonable. Waiting 30 years for peer-reviewed enema journals isn‚Äôt an option now!) The info is from as many sources as you can imagine: podcasts, YouTube vids, scientific studies and journals, blogs, natural cure sites, etc. Any mention of it, I searched for and took in the key points. So as for references, as much as I would like to prove the things behind what I mention here, it would be hard to go back and find all the sources over the last 4 years. Luckily, it‚Äôs not too complex, and clinically its effectiveness speaks for itself. Therefore a few attempts on your own will let you experience the benefits better than reading about them ever could do so. Also, many parts of this are just my own theories and experiments, which I pass on due to them being very helpful and successful, and when they come up I will mention it and explain the rationale as to why I am doing it.*

***How the coffee enema is supposed to be working:***

*From everything I have gathered so far, there are 4 things going on.*

*‚Ä¢ Firstly, ‚Äúthey‚Äù say glutathione production in the liver is boosted by 600% or so during the duration of the enema and shortly afterwards. This can be boosted by coffee with higher amounts of caffeine, palmitic acid, and diterpenes named ‚Äòcafestol‚Äô and ‚Äòkahweol‚Äô (google searches on the latter two already produce excellent scientific studies). Blood takes 3 minutes to pass around the whole body on average, leaving the liver and coming back round. So, 21-minute enemas allow the blood to be pushed through the liver, roughly 7 times, when the liver is supercharged with glutathione production. (While it may be hard to prove this, clinical experience backs this. The night and day difference between the before and after of an enema really makes you feel this one! Most notable, is the clearing of cytokines in this process. Try for yourself. Brain fog is helped a lot! And general energy and blood flow.) Also, with the implications of Lyme disease on glutathione production/dysfunction, if true, the effects should feel significant to glutathione depleted patients.*

*‚Ä¢ Secondly, the bile release is huge. You will hear it, gurgling away. If you have a doctor‚Äôs stethoscope, you can place it there to really hear this. This one is quite simple to feel and experience and requires no more explanation. (The binder usage is linked to this result and is important and will be discussed later.) Constant, explosive bile release will mechanically clean out your liver and gallbladder. A liver flush performs this function roughly 20 times more effectively than coffee enemas, but, just constantly forcing bile like this out can massively improve the health of the gut, as plentiful bile normally coats the GI system, maintaining appropriate pH, fostering good gut bacteria and killing unwanted ones, and of course, digesting foods properly. My stomach feels so warm and not bloated after a coffee enema for the rest of the day.*

*‚Ä¢ Thirdly, there is the lesser spoken about topic of the osmotic exchange between the body of liquid and your colon. This is why even plain, lightly salted water enemas can do so much too. There is always an osmotic exchange with water, and as we are 70% water, lots can be let go and swapped over as you wait with the liquid inside. This is why holding it in longer is good too.*

*‚Ä¢ Finally, and what excites me most is the hepatic portal vein. (And this a bit of my own thinking‚Ä¶) Have a look at the picture of the gut on the next page. I assume rectal drug delivery is known to be better than oral for many things, (e.g. why the hype for glutathione butt plugs?) Basic coffee enemas working show lots of active components must travelling through the colon, into various organs, to be producing such therapeutic effects, as well as the strong bile release. So, clearly uptake is good up there! Caffeine is getting absorbed through, and probably all the other stuff too. This is where the idea of adding in other elements comes in. Anything orally taken must be broken down by your GI system (which may not work well in chronic conditions) and must be absorbed across the gut lining, which also may be inflamed/thickened/malfunctioning a bit in illness. As per the diagram, you can see the rich vasculature of the colon, and the direct lines to the liver, spleen and pancreas, and even further up from there (brain). I personally believe now from experimentation that certain accepted nutrients/molecules are directly being taken into the blood this way. So, this is a potentially exciting way to get herbs, supplements, oils, and even fewer toxic pharmaceuticals (maybe not ABX, but DSF is great!) into the body and into organs more effectively. So, for me, a DSF pill in the enema liquid gives me far more kick, compared to the alternate day when I just take it orally. Tinctures are superb here to throw in, herb capsules can be opened and mixed in nicely. I will talk later about NT factor/phospholipids and potential home-made liposomes.*

***1. WHAT YOU NEED: Like the ‚Äúbasic package‚Äù:***

*‚Ä¢ One stainless steel enema bucket (10-20 GBP) (example: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Enema-Quart-Stainless-Steel-Bucket/dp/B07171C4NC/ref=sr\_1\_9?adgrpid=110968925424&dchild=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIk9eevJOb6wIVVeDtCh38nQdPEAAYASAAEgILmfD\_BwE&hvadid=448097466908&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9045941&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=11777187204499783744&hvtargid=kwd-298168739501&hydadcr=11223\_1841112&keywords=enema+bucket&qid=1597423827&sr=8-9&tag=googhydr-21)*

*It would be wise to avoid plastic pouch enema kits, or plastic buckets. Warm/hot coffee and plastic is a recipe for chemicals and plastics being leached into your coffee liquid, especially if this is done regularly. The price difference between the two is also very small (the example bucket above is the one I have now and will last a lifetime.) Don‚Äôt risk it to save $5‚Ä¶. This bucket system will come with ass nozzles for every fit, and the surgical tubing going from bucket to ass. You won‚Äôt need anything else equipment-wise.*

*‚Ä¢ ORGANIC, ‚ÄúLight/gold roast‚Äù enema coffee (10-20 GBP) (example: The best 3 types I have tried so far over the years are, in order of best:*

*1. S.A. Wilson* [*https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wilson-Green-Coffee/dp/B00ZZ5KRTO/ref=sr\_1\_10?dchild=1&keywords=enema+coffee+wilson&qid=1597424243&sr=8-10*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wilson-Green-Coffee/dp/B00ZZ5KRTO/ref=sr_1_10?dchild=1&keywords=enema+coffee+wilson&qid=1597424243&sr=8-10)

*2. Robusta* [*https://www.amazon.co.uk/RobustaHealth-Organic-Natural-Detox-Coffee/dp/B017KTNMMQ/ref=sr\_1\_6?dchild=1&keywords=enema+coffee&qid=1597424208&sr=8-6*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/RobustaHealth-Organic-Natural-Detox-Coffee/dp/B017KTNMMQ/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=enema+coffee&qid=1597424208&sr=8-6)

*3. Gerson Roast* [*https://www.amazon.co.uk/Organic-Gerson-Roast-Therapeutic-Coffee/dp/B07GDTVHM7/ref=sr\_1\_15?dchild=1&keywords=enema+coffee&qid=1597424208&sr=8-15*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Organic-Gerson-Roast-Therapeutic-Coffee/dp/B07GDTVHM7/ref=sr_1_15?dchild=1&keywords=enema+coffee&qid=1597424208&sr=8-15)

*You can use normal coffee, and I used to do so for a few months, but trying actual enema coffee produced a much stronger effect for me (and most personal reports I have read- and by strong I mean more bile comes out, but it feels more relaxing and peaceful), more bile expulsion, and probably most importantly, using commercial coffee is often not organic, pesticides and chemicals are liberally used, and they are usually left in storage for many months meaning mycotoxins are a big problem for coffee beans. My enemas using regular coffee, from my early experiences, were more jarring on the system, and I felt way more wired. More kidney pains back then. Not so nice. With the proper enema coffee, I could almost fall asleep during some coffee enemas. It‚Äôs so calming and peaceful, believe it or not. You may see many enema brands boasting about Palmitic acid, Caffeine content, and some go deeper and mention Cafestol and Kahweol. Gold roast coffee has been found to be much higher in the content of these four substances, all of which contribute to more successful coffee enemas.*

*‚Ä¢ Bottled Spring Water!! (NEVER tap water):*

*Tap water, even if Brita filtered or with another device, is known to have a dizzying array of very small molecules and nanoparticles of metabolites from urine, hormones, narcotics, chlorine, etc. No home filtration is going to be good enough to get that all out. The risk is not worth it, just like with the enema bucket, or the coffee being used. Do not cut corners on these things, when the price difference is so small too. So, just always use bottled, spring water. I buy 3-5L big bottles of water and use them for enemas. So cheap, so buy in bulk to save.*

*‚Ä¢ Good quality salt:*

*This can be just Himalayan pink salt. Amazon has it, health food stores sell it, and I pick mine up in TK MAXX of all places, as they always have it there for cheap. It‚Äôs 3-5 quid for 500g or so and if you can choose, finer salt is better to work with. Or Celtic sea salt is another option. I like the pink salt as it‚Äôs less potentially toxic, I just don‚Äôt trust the ocean these days lol.*

***2. WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:***

*a) Measure out 1100ml of fresh spring water into an empty kettle. Boil it, and then pour that into a stainless-steel cooking pot. Turn on your hob, and when the water is boiling, add in one tablespoon of the enema coffee powder into the pot. Stir it well, and then let it roll on full boil for 3 minutes WITH NO LID. This will evaporate some of the fats and oils out. After 3 minutes, turn the hob down to the smallest flame, and simmer the pot for 15 mins now WITH THE LID ON. After that turn off the hob. (18 minutes total cooking time.)*

*(Beginners note: If this is your first time, don‚Äôt try to use 1100ml. You can start with 250ml, or maybe 500ml. Work up to maybe 1500ml? That‚Äôs about perfect for me, a skinny-ish guy at 178cm, but everyone does have different sized colons. Enema size is important, so try to find an amount the stretches your colon a bit, but not too much (aim to eventually get to between 1100ml and 1500ml.) Smaller volumes should make it easier to hold it in at the beginning. Also, be careful with the coffee, one tablespoon is the norm, but at the start, try ¬º tablespoons or ¬Ω, because you don‚Äôt know how you will react initially. Start low and slow here, like with so many other Lyme interventions. You can go up to 2 tablespoons. I usually go between 1-2 tablespoons, mixing it up each time. More coffee will produce a more powerful bile expulsion.*

*b) Now, find a handy cheesecloth, tea towel or a fine mesh cotton cloth, like an old T-shirt, or a cloth napkin/handkerchief. Place this cloth over a colander, and pour your coffee liquid through this, into an empty pot. You just want to remove coarse pieces of the coffee. You should be left with a pot of filtered coffee, no grounds. You can bin the grounds and wash the cloth. Let it cool down. (I fill the sink with cold water and place the pot in there to speed up the cooldown.) ((The 15 minute simmer will reduce volume by about 300ml. Replace that lost liquid at the end by topping it up with more spring water.))*

*(Beginners note on binders: Now would be a great time to take some binders. It takes roughly 30 mins for what you put into your mouth to reach the area in the duodenum where bile is released. So, aim to get a binder selection into your system 30 mins before you do the enema, to time it that the bile gets released exactly when you have binders there to mop it all up.)*

*c) Take one half teaspoon of pink Himalayan salt and stir it in. The salt is to protect against electrolyte loss. Every enema must have one if you do them a lot. (I ALWAYS add 5 drops of tangerine essential oil onto the salts as they sit on the spoon, and it soaks into the salt grains. This is optional, but certainly think about adding this step later on.) The water temperature of the coffee enema should be as warm as your hand. So, when you put your finger in to test it, it should not hurt at all. Lukewarm to warm.*

*d) Your basic coffee enema is now ready to go. With the bucket set up, and the hose clip in the LOCKED position (squeezing the tube shut) pour the liquid into the bucket. Now, hold the nozzle end high up near your chest, and pointing upwards. Release the clamp, and the liquid will fill the tube (but physics will stop it flowing out and too high). Lower the height of the nozzle downwards slowly, and the coffee will rise towards end of the tube. Once the coffee inside the tube is close to the ass-piece, CLOSE the clamp. Now the air is out the tube.*

*e) Lay a towel down, with the bucket higher up than you (1 meter off the ground or hanging on a door handle etc.). Gravity will affect the bucket (if it‚Äôs on the floor, the force will be weak, if it‚Äôs hanging from the ceiling, the force will be very high.) It‚Äôs best to split the 21 minutes into three, 7-minute chunks. When you are ready, start lying in the foetal position on your RIGHT SIDE on the towel. Lubricate the nozzle with any oil for easy insertion and once the nozzle is inside more than ONE INCH minimum, release the clamp. The enema liquid will flow down your descending (your left side looking down) colon, across the traverse (middle) colon and start filling ONLY the ascending (your right side looking down) colon. Let it all go in. If it‚Äôs too slow, I hold the bucket up above in the air. If it feels too fast, I lower the bucket in the air downwards. (STIR the contents with a table spoon as it goes in; this is only important/useful if you have added in extra goodies, as they can just sink to the bottom and not enter your system, slightly wasting them.)*

*f) Once it‚Äôs all in, CLOSE the clamp (sometimes about 30ml of liquid remains in the tube, don‚Äôt worry) and then remove the tube, throw the tub into a close by shower/bath tab to be cleaned later. Go right back and resume lying in the right sided foetal position and start your 21-minute timer on your phone/watch. As you lie there, massage your colon with your hands, similar to this video: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIHuChEvXUs&feature=youtu.be).*

*After 7 minutes, swap over and lie in the foetal position on your left side. Massage that side of the colon gently. The liquid will slowly fill the other side. Finally, after 14 minutes, lie on your back with your knees up for the last 7 minutes, again, massaging the transverse/middle colon.*

*g) Once you reach roughly 21 minutes, you can stand up and go and sit on the toilet. Try not to push it all out and strain, to avoid getting piles. That could happen if regularly do this and keep straining your sphincter muscle. The colon will move the liquid to the exit, and you will feel it when it‚Äôs there, and it will effortlessly come out. I sit there and relax for about 5-10 mins, as you get waves of more stuff coming. Have a shower, and you are done. In the beginning, you may get watery bowel movements up to a few hours afterwards too. So, for the first few you try, do it on a ‚Äústay at home‚Äù day lol.*

***Why those positions during the enema?***

*Well, if you just lie on your back, you will have the liquid sit in the middle section. If you choose one side for the whole enema, you are not utilising the surface area of the other 2/3s of the colon, reducing the uptake and effectiveness of the process. Whereas, if you lie 7 mins on the right side, you force all your enema liquid into the right side of colon, and this can almost inflate the walls of the colon and get all the goodness into any nooks, and also will increase the surface area of that part of the colon. (This is why you should work up to larger and larger enema volumes, to maximise this function! 500ml enemas won‚Äôt do near as much as 1500ml, in this respect.) The next 7 mins on your left side (for me is most significant/strong- the left side has its OWN blood supply from the ‚Äòinferior mesenteric vein‚Äô, while the left and middle colon both ‚Äúshare‚Äù the superior mesenteric vein) will then move all the liquid to the left side, and again, will ‚Äúblow up‚Äù the area like a balloon, and you utilise this chunk of the membrane and the blood network on this side. Finally, 7 minutes on your back allows the coffee liquid to fully expand your middle section, and this part gets it chance to uptake as many of the nutrients as possible. You are of course welcome to try your own things! But try this system first and notice the difference every time you move into each new position. I get big urges to release when I move into new positions. You will come to learn which urges you can hold in, and which ones need to be released. 99% of these urges to ‚Äúlet it all out‚Äù pass in about 10 seconds. It will go, and you will be able to relax again. However, for whatever reason, sometimes they are too much to hold in, and you will come to learn which they are! ; )*

*Maybe try your first enema in a bathtub during a warm bath. This will take out all the worry about accidently letting out a little squirt without ruining your favourite towel, carpet, or wallpaper. If you can‚Äôt hold it in, and it all comes out, it will be an easy clean. I wish I had this advice when I first started. ‚Ä¶ : D*

***1. Binders:***

*Binders are a crucial aspect of this, to do it safely and effectively, especially in the context of Lyme disease. Protecting the kidneys is paramount, but also, no binders means you may kick up cytokines again because the toxins suddenly are released into your GI system‚Ä¶ this can trigger herxes and more inflammation. Binders remove these annoying toxins before they can set off more cytokines. Some problems can include some kidney pain. If your kidneys hurt, too many toxins are being released into the gut, and the kidneys are picking up too much slack. Or, you are using too much coffee, so lower the amount and try again after a day or two. Either way, any kidney pain should not be ignored, and a break from coffee enemas would be wise to figure out why. Binders going through the gut and mopping up the bile and various biotoxins will protect the kidneys. (Your gut lining regenerates endlessly, and has a huge surface area, your kidney‚Äôs surface area is far smaller and DOES NOT regenerate, so their protection is vital.) Remember, biotoxins often cannot leave the body if your immune system does not recognise them. This can occur especially in mold illness. If you force out biotoxins from the liver and gallbladder, and there is nothing to mop them up, the entero-hepatic circulatory system (recycles your bile) will absorb all those toxins, they go back into the blood stream, and they will be deposited elsewhere around the body.*

*Binders to consider include: Bentonite clay, activated charcoal, chlorella, zeolite, diatomaceous earth, zeobent (bentonite/zeolite mix), cholestyramine and welchol. (last two are prescription only.) Even the vegetable lady fingers/okra has been found to have about 16% of the binding potential of one dose of cholestyramine! Food for thought!*

***2. Liposomes, Herbs and Meds:***

*Eventually from coffee enemas, your curiosity will grow, especially if you tolerate them well and can enjoy their benefits! What else can you get up there? Tinctures are great, and herb capsules can be opened and added in. I decided to try DSF, and it was a fantastic idea. ABX is probably not too wise to put up there. Ideally, herbs and natural things should be used only as a rule of thumb, but I was not too concerned with the idea of DSF going up there and made that decision to go for it. (Would at least circumvent the copper complex problem in the gut!)*

*Dr Klinghardt has explained how making liposomal formulas is possible at home, using either a jewellery cleaner or a high-speed blender. This is how he got his patients (before liposomal preparations existed) to make liposomal herbal medicines at home. I have tried enemas using just herbs, tinctures and DSF thrown in the base liquid. I also tried the same combinations, but instead, added those same constituents into blender with 300ml spring water, and one scoop of NT Factor phospholipids. (https://www.allergyresearchgroup.com/ntfactor-energylipids-powder-150-grams). This is a phenomenal product, the best combination of varying phospholipid groups I have found. The idea is you should create liposomes in the water, with many of the active molecules from your herbs and drugs being engulfed into liposomes. I herxed a bit more than normal when I began using this system, and I have stuck with it for 4-5 months now. Even if ALL the liposomes fail to form, the body has been discovered to readily take up these phospholipids without limit, as they are very sought after in our biology. So, nothing is wasted. However, I feel huge differences between enemas before and after utilising this mechanism. It‚Äôs win-win. Maybe try for yourself and see. (Fats are very well taken up through the colon too; again, why are our butt plugs made from cocoa butter? For better absorption in the colon!)*

*(E.g. Blood boosting herb enema: Make the enema liquid base as usual, and right at the end, I stir in one capsule of a selection of herbs such as: alpha GPC, Dan Shen, Feverfew, Butchers broom, pycnogenol, ginseng, ginkgo biloba, Huperzine A. In this case, remember to stir as the enema liquid goes inside, so all the herb bits also go inside.)*

*(At the moment, my favourite enema is doing 1 or 1.5 tablespoons of coffee powder, one small dose (size of grain of rice) of Shilajit, 5 drops of organic tangerine essential oil on the half teaspoon of salt. Then in the blender, 30 drops of cryptolepis, 20 Andrographis, 20 cat‚Äôs claw, 20 sarsaparilla, with one 250mg pill of DSF, blended with those phospholipids. And finally, 4 caps of turkey tail. All mixed together, and up there for 21 mins. Zing.)*

***3. Nutrient carriers/transporters:***

*There are a few select substances that are known as nutrient carriers/transports, that can greatly increase the overall absorption of the enema goodness. They are few and far between, but ‚ÄúShilajit‚Äù has been in my enemas from about 2 years ago. The high content of humic and fulvic acid is known to help increase the overall absorption of nutrients and carry more nutrients over. Recently, another product has come up which I think will fit this function nicely, and that‚Äôs the turkey tail (high in Polysaccharide Peptides \[PSP\] and Polysaccharide Krestin \[PSK\].) I have used turkey tail (not liposomally) now twice, 4 caps mixed into the enema base at the very end. I am aiming to get the PSP and PSK to allow nutrients even further and deeper into my system. This is all just optional stuff for anyone interested. PSP/PSK also seem like another great, relevant mushroom supplement for Lyme and co, look up the research!*

***4. Extra massaging tips:***

*I sometimes use a handheld vibrating massager to really vibrate and work the colon when I do my enema, instead of using my hands. This works loads better, and really improves absorption and the blood flow of that region. No need to buy this extra, just if you have a massage thingy like that lying around at home, you can use that to further improve this part of the process.*

***5. Organic tangerine oil in the salt:***

*This tip came from a better health guy podcast, and the guy mentioned it as one of the best things for coffee enemas. All I can say, is I do not have enemas without it now. Enemas were much more comfortable and soothing with the addition of 5 drops of this tangerine oil. Scientifically, he mentioned that this oil helps to further relax the bile ducts, but overall, it‚Äôs a top tip and I glad I tried it. But, not necessary, just something to add in if you can, and again, see if you can tell the difference. I can!*

***6. Dehydration:***

*Coffee is very dehydrating on the body, but this enema may also make you urinate a bit more than usual afterwards, and your urine may be clearer for some time. So, lots of water is leaving the body. I find it feels like my kidneys are suddenly pushing out more fluid for the one or two hours after. Make sure you drink extra amounts of water for the rest of the day with electrolyte replacements like a half a teaspoon of pink salt again in there.*

***7. Poop:***

*I usually do not have a bowel movement after this enema for the rest of the day. These days it‚Äôs become one in the evening, just maybe. Either way, don‚Äôt be worried if you don‚Äôt poop for the day after it. You have just shunted all your food through your guts and out your arse. You‚Äôll be back to being ‚Äúregular‚Äù the next day.*

***8. How often? And any supporting supplements?***

*Coffee enemas can be done often, but I personally do them every other day. This gives me one rest day for my body to not be stimulated like that. One every two days is still quite a lot. Anyone who is feeling awfully ill or a regular basis should try some out and see what effect it has on you, and that constant shite feeling we have come to know. It can be used to pull yourself out of a herx. For me, even years ago, it would just clear away so much of the cytokine storm that I could function in my job. So it always pulled me out of hell for 6 hours. The Gerson Cancer Center has patients doing them every 2 hours or so. If I wake up and feel tragic, (which has happened a lot in the last 5 years) this is THE FIRST thing I will do, to save a day where I needed to be on point. And it has done just that for me, for 4 years. This was my only go to support system when I was stuck in China, and liver flushes once a month. I owe getting through that worst year of my life to coffee enemas. Each Lyme patient is different, but it seems to have a high rate of reducing many symptoms in people with chronic conditions. We have to try things like this an individual to know if it‚Äôs going to work well with our unique system. Find a routine and balance it with what feels right. Your body will tell you if you are over doing it. I guess start at 1 coffee enema every 3-5 days. You will see very quickly how your body responds to it, and how you feel from it. If it triggers too much stuff and is a very unpleasant experience, take a break for a few days, half the amount of coffee, and try again.*

*The only supplement to be taking to make sure you aren‚Äôt ridding your body of glutathione precursors, is NAC. Luckily this is cheap to use, $10 on Amazon. We all take glutathione suppositories anyway, so that will really help our systems too. I will always take my glutathione buttplug on a coffee enema day, as my own personal protocol involving enemas, infrared saunas, biofilm busters and blood herbs really do make me feel like I need it that day. I think excessive use of coffee enemas could potentially deplete certain nutrients related to glutathione, and potentially other systems, if not done properly and too often. (I have not heard any reports yet of this, but I am still cautious.)* ",1,1730304294.0,TheLiverFlush,0,1.0,False

Long time lurker and first time poster here. Looking for feedback on my query. Thanks!

‚Äî

Hi [Agent]!

Since you stated you were interested in [blank] on your [MSWL/Twitter/Website/Blog], I‚Äôd like to introduce THE IMMORTAL‚ÄôS ASSISTANT. At 105k words and the first book of a planned series, it‚Äôs an adult contemporary fantasy novel that combines dark academia horror and mystery like seen in Leigh Bardugo‚Äôs Ninth House and Olivie Blake‚Äôs The Atlas Six. This book would also be enjoyed by readers who are fans of the monster-hunting and family drama seen in the CW show Supernatural.

Alice Foster, a stubborn Princeton student with a habit of hiding her emotions, and her father, a professor at the university, are shocked when his terminal cancer miraculously vanishes. All seems well with the professor until he starts pacing the halls all night and mumbling to himself about shadow-creatures stalking him. One day her father goes missing, and in a desperate search Alice gets trapped in the basement with a reanimated dead body as her house burns down above her.

Rescued by a group of monster-hunting immortals who can wield elemental magic, Alice is thrown into the hidden world of daemons, alchemy, and blood rituals. When she discovers her father‚Äôs old journal, she learns that in order to cure his cancer, he created the Elixir of Life with the help of one of his former students. The elixir‚Äôs main ingredient is blood, and each addicting taste increases his strength and pushes him further into madness.

As the number of local murders rises, Alice works together with this eclectic group of immortals, including estranged brothers William and Leander, using magic and a newly-discovered hidden ability to help locate her father and stop him before he becomes dangerously invincible. Bonds of trust form and crumble as everyone around her lies through their teeth about their true intentions, when all she wants to do is bring her father back from the evil that consumes him before more innocent people are killed.

[Short bio]

Thank you for your time and consideration!

First 300 Words: 

Some say a miracle cured her father‚Äôs cancer, while others say he made a deal with the devil. Alice Foster wasn‚Äôt sure what to believe, except it was too good to be true. Last spring, his cancer disappeared with absolutely no evidence remaining on his radiology scans or in his bloodwork. Alice had questioned the doctor again and again, wondering if there could‚Äôve been a mistake. All the while, her father sat on the cold plastic chair in blissful shock before shaking the doctor‚Äôs hand and leaving the office with a newfound spring in his step. His vitality and zest for life lasted until around mid November when his listless behavior and pallid complexion returned. He refused to go back to the doctor, no matter how much she had begged.

Alice chewed her lip with worry as she rushed out of her molecular biology class, pushing past the throng of careless students yapping away about weekend parties. The cold January air whipped around her body, threatening to topple her over as she hurried across campus towards her dad‚Äôs office. Her clunky faux-leather loafers crackled over the salted sidewalks, the brine staining the back of her tights. She pulled her tweed peacoat tighter to shield herself from the biting wind of the incoming evening snowstorm. Alice hadn‚Äôt heard from her father all day, when normally he‚Äôd meet up with her for a quick coffee or at least send her texts between his lectures. His silence concerned her. He had been withdrawing more and more lately.

Adjusting the strap of her messenger bag, she sighed with an empty sort of nostalgia as she stepped into the courtyard of East Pyne Hall, where a couple stragglers posed by the historic brownstone walls to take photos.

1 - chai. If we are supposed to avoid drinking un bottled water - can we not drink the chai or coffee?

2 - avoiding the tourist traps BUT seeing the sights. We will be based in Delhi for 3 days, and planned on getting a driver and going to Agra to see the sights, taking the train to Haridwar and getting a driver there. I have read much feedback that these are not good places to go. Is that correct? 

3- seems to be some disdain for planning booked tours. We will be going to Kerala for a week and have booked a tour. Do the tours not do a good job of showing the place? I am looking forward to our time in Kerala and want to make the most of it.

My left eye has been twitching for more than a year, and now my right eye has started twitching also. I have a routine doctor's appointment in January, but l'm concerned this might be something a bit more urgent.

I went to an optometrist last year, to see about the twitch in my left eye. They were not concerned and I was actually diagnosed with Keratoconus around that time. So I was sidetracked by the treatment for that, and have not been able to address the twitching since. Now, my right eye is twitching and I'm freaking out a little.

I have panic disorder/anxiety, a pretty stressful job, and I never sleep well. I don't drink coffee or caffeinated teas. The twitching has not gotten worse, aside from the fact that it's both eyes now.

My left eye has been consistently twitching everyday, several times a day, for a few seconds at a time, since September of last year. My right eye started twitching a couple of days ago‚Äîboth in my top eyelids.

I'm prone to overreacting when it comes to medical stuff and I'm hoping this can wait until I see my primary doctor in January.

1gfq0ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1gfq0ui/think_im_too_naive_for_dating_apps/,Think I‚Äôm too naive for dating apps,"I‚Äôm someone who rarely uses dating apps for just fun. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do and I do go on meets, but I am trying to find something a bit more like a relationship than just fuck.

I just don‚Äôt understand guys intentions and think I‚Äôm just a bit naive, wish I could just move on and forget something but I feel such an urge to just go back to a guy on some things.

My example is I was chatting to someone older than me. I popped up to him, just said he was good looking, he said it back, we spoke about ourselves and got on, exchanged numbers and spoke more then went about our day.

The next day, he messaged me on the app, we spoke more again, he suggested we meet up for a coffee or something. We didn‚Äôt really mention sex much when talking, but he did suggest to meet up for a chat and date almost so I was good with that.

The next day, I messaged him and it was like a light switch. Blunt,not overly chatty. He‚Äôd reply, but not really continue the convo. I thought about post nut clarity but then thought, he didn‚Äôt even have any nudes, we didn‚Äôt talk much about sex, and he‚Äôs now making excuses to meet, after he was the one that suggested it and said he‚Äôll check when he‚Äôs free and he was the one that messaged me starting a convo the next day.

I sent another message a couple of days later asking if he was still up for meeting at all and he can tell me if not. 
He told me what he liked about me, found me attractive but was now worried about age and how we lived an hour from each other. 
I guess me being hopeful took ‚Äúworried‚Äù as there‚Äôs still a possibility and I also thought - this isn‚Äôt binding, we could just meet as friends that may get together for some fun. I told him I can accom. 

I sent messages the next couple of days and again, got replies, but not really continuing the conversation.

I guess I‚Äôm a bit too innocent for this game but I just want to know what went wrong? What happened? 
I left it and the couple of weeks later saw he was online, so sent a message just asking how he was. Again, he replied, didn‚Äôt ask me back how I was, I replied, he replied, and then he just made himself appear offline (which you can tell).

I just thought, seriously? Could have just not replied or even blocked me. Id get the picture then. I feel like messaging and just asking what changed, did he really just shoot a load over a pleasant chat and decide ‚Äúnot for me‚Äù. I don‚Äôt understand how guys can just fall off like that.

I know I should just let it go and don‚Äôt know why I care about someone I hardly know being blunt with me but I just feel like sending one final message saying something like ‚Äúnot sure what happened, you don‚Äôt even seem keen to chat as potential friends when you were so lovely before and keen to know about me. you‚Äôve got my number if you want to contact me or just block me and I‚Äôll get the clear picture‚Äù.

1gfpvv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1gfpvv1/being_addicted_doesnt_necessarily_mean_spending_a/,Being addicted doesn't necessarily mean spending a lot of time... ,"I decided recently to box up my gaming consoles and put them in storage. 

I have a full time job, married, and I'm also a parent... I have VERY little time to game, probably only 15ish hours per week. But I'm still addicted to it, and here's why: 

\-Gaming has led to poor performance at work and home. On WFH days I've gotten accustomed to long ""gaming lunches"", and maybe some gaming morning coffee, oh and maybe a mid-afternoon gaming snack. I'm lucky I can Work From Home 2x per week, but you'd think I could apply myself to my job or if not, at bare minimum help out with getting some chores done. But nah. 

\-I have something like a withdrawal/recoil to losing my precious gaming time at night. Sometimes I rush through things during the day, or rush trying to get my child to bed, so that I can game.  This has led to me being an asshole sometimes, too, when I'm urging my family to move through our night time routine quickly because I don't want to lose ""me"" time. 

\-There's never ""enough"" gaming. Despite having less than 20 hours to game on a good week, I keep starting games that are way too long - Death Stranding, Elden Ring, Metaphor Refantazio, etc. There's no way I can play these games now, but I keep starting them and then getting anxious/angry about my ability to keep them in my life. 

\-My other hobbies, which I define myself by and pride myself on, like making music and playing guitar, or studying languages, go to the wayside. I work WAY HARDER at games and WAY LONGER than I do at basically any other activity in my life, and I don't really even enjoy them!

  
Anyway, just sharing this because I wanted to get my story out there. Addiction doesn't always look like someone who plays 80 hours per week while their life crumbles around them. It can also look like a very ""moderate"" or even ideal hobby on the outside but really it's a toxic relationship with an addictive substance. I think there is some space for gaming in my life (party games, retro) but the place it inhabits in my psyche currently is so ridiculously outsized that I just needed to stop.

1gfpr0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheMidnightNarrator/comments/1gfpr0k/beneath_the_snow/,Beneath the Snow ,"(1) The Disappearances

It started at the beginning of winter. I remember the first snowstorm hit our neighborhood in early December, covering everything in a thick white blanket. The air smelled clean, the sky was gray, and the world felt soft and quiet. We were excited at first‚Äîsnow meant snowball fights, forts, and maybe a day off school. But soon after, people began to disappear.

At first, it was just some kids‚Äîmostly the ones who wandered off by themselves. Some teachers said they might‚Äôve run away. My friend Mark disappeared when he was walking home from school, just a block from my house. His parents knocked on doors, asking if anyone had seen him, but no one had. There weren‚Äôt any footprints leading away from his usual route. Just a patch of roughed-up snow near the side of the road, like maybe someone had fallen.

Then adults started vanishing, too. A man from the next street over, a woman who worked at the post office. Just gone. No signs of struggle. Only disturbed snow, like someone had kicked it up before the wind smoothed it over again.

The grown-ups around me acted strange about it, though. It was like they couldn‚Äôt care less. They told us kids not to worry, but their eyes seemed distant when they said it, like they weren‚Äôt really paying attention. Parents told us to stay on the sidewalks, but no one seemed that upset. They still sent us to school, still went to work, still pretended everything was fine.

I kept thinking about Mark. He was my best friend. Something felt wrong‚Äîreally wrong‚Äîand I knew that whatever was happening wasn‚Äôt normal.


---

(2) The Creature

The day I saw it happen, I was walking home from school by myself. Snow had been falling all morning, piling up in thick drifts along the street. I knew I shouldn‚Äôt take the shortcut through the park, but it was cold, and I wanted to get home fast. The shortcut cut through a field where the snow lay thick and untouched, like a perfect white sheet spread over the ground.

I was halfway across the field when I saw movement out of the corner of my eye‚Äîa quick, jerking motion just beyond the swing set. I stopped and stared. It was Billy Donovan. He lived a few houses down from me, the kind of kid who always ate paste in kindergarten and talked with his mouth full. He was dragging his sled behind him, his boots crunching in the fresh snow.

And then it happened.

The snow beneath Billy shifted‚Äîopened, really‚Äîlike a giant white mouth with jagged edges. Something black and impossibly fast shot out from the hole, wrapping around his legs. Billy didn‚Äôt even have time to scream. One moment, he was standing there, and the next, the snow seemed to fold over him, swallowing him whole. All that was left was a churned-up patch of snow where he had been. The sled clattered to the ground, rocking back and forth.

I stood there, frozen, my breath catching in my throat. I felt like I was going to throw up. I wanted to run, but my legs felt like lead. It had happened so fast‚Äîtoo fast‚Äîand now there was no sign of Billy except the roughed-up snow.


---

(3) Nobody Believes Me

I ran all the way home, my heart slamming in my chest. I burst through the front door, shouting about what I‚Äôd seen. My mom was in the kitchen, stirring something on the stove. She barely glanced at me.

‚ÄúBilly‚Äôs gone!‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúSomething took him! It came out of the snow and grabbed him!‚Äù

She stirred the pot, slowly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough, David. Go wash up for dinner.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! You don‚Äôt understand! I saw it happen‚Äîsomething‚Äôs out there! We have to call the police!‚Äù

She turned to me then, her face strangely blank. ‚ÄúDavid, enough. You‚Äôre just imagining things. Billy will be fine. Kids wander off all the time.‚Äù

I stared at her, my skin prickling with fear. It wasn‚Äôt just what she said‚Äîit was how she said it. Like she wasn‚Äôt even really there. Like she didn‚Äôt care at all.


---

(4) School, as Usual

The next day, they sent me to school like nothing had happened. I tried to tell my teacher, Mrs. Parker, about what I saw, but she just gave me a tight-lipped smile.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you had a bad dream, David,‚Äù she said, patting me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt dreaming. I knew what I saw. But nobody would believe me. Not my mom, not my teachers, not even the other kids. They just kept going on with their lives like everything was normal, even though people were disappearing all around us.

That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the snow opening up, the creature‚Äôs black shape lunging out, Billy being dragged under.


---

(5) The Final Day

The days kept dragging on, and I became obsessed with the idea that the snow was hiding something terrible. I didn‚Äôt know what it was or where it came from, but I knew it was real. Every time I stepped outside, I could feel it, waiting just beneath the surface.

I started carrying a flashlight and a whistle in my pocket, just in case. I told myself I‚Äôd be ready if it came for me. But deep down, I knew that wouldn‚Äôt make a difference.

The day it finally happened, I was on my way home from school again. I stuck to the sidewalks like my mom had told me, but the snow had piled up everywhere, and it was hard to see where the ground ended and the drifts began. The streetlights were just flickering on, casting long shadows across the snow.

I felt it before I saw it. The ground beneath me shifted, like something was stirring just below the surface. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. I tried to run, but the snow gave way beneath my feet.


---

(6) Taken

The creature sprang.

In an instant, I felt something cold and slimy wrap around my ankles, yanking me downward. I screamed, but the sound was muffled by the snow as it closed over my head.

And then everything went black.


---

(7) After the Fall

The world beneath the snow was a hollow, frozen maze, crisscrossed with tunnels that stretched in every direction. David‚Äôs small body was dragged through the narrow passageways, his scream lost in the endless dark. The creature moved swiftly, pulling him deeper and deeper beneath the surface, far beyond the reach of sunlight or rescue.

It was a thing ancient and hungry, with long, spindly limbs like icicles and eyes that glowed faintly in the dark. It had no face, only a maw filled with jagged teeth, sharp as splinters of broken glass. It scuttled through the tunnels like a spider, dragging David along behind it, his legs trailing uselessly in the snow.

He struggled at first, kicking and squirming, but the thing‚Äôs grip was too strong. The cold seeped into his skin, slowing his movements, until his limbs felt heavy and numb. His mind grew hazy, slipping in and out of consciousness.

The creature carried him to a vast, icy cavern deep beneath the neighborhood. Here, the walls were lined with the frozen bodies of others who had been taken‚Äîadults and children alike, their faces pale and lifeless, their eyes wide with terror.

David‚Äôs body was placed among them, tucked neatly into the wall like a doll in a glass case. He could still see, still think, but he couldn‚Äôt move. The cold had claimed him completely, leaving him frozen and helpless, trapped beneath the snow.

Above ground, the snow fell in soft, silent drifts, covering the disturbed patch of ground where David had been taken. The wind whispered through the trees, erasing all traces of the struggle.

By morning, the neighborhood was as quiet and peaceful as ever, and life went on.


---

(8) The Aftermath

The next day, David‚Äôs mother stood at the window, sipping her coffee. The snow had stopped falling, and the world outside was calm and still.

She frowned, her brow furrowing slightly, as if trying to remember something important. There had been a boy, hadn‚Äôt there? A boy named David...

But the thought slipped away before she could grasp it, vanishing like breath on a cold winter‚Äôs morning.

She turned away from the window, humming softly to herself. Somewhere outside, a gust of wind kicked up a flurry of snow, and the world moved on, oblivious to the lives buried beneath its surface.

Hotel: Playa Azul. Book through their website online rather than Booking.com or at the desk for the best price. With tax we paid $103/night at the end of October. Snorkeling is better here than anywhere I went down south, like near Moneybar. It‚Äôs fun both directions and there is a Chak Mol sculpture underwater a bit to the south. Going north there is more to see in shallower water. The wall at the base of the restaurant at or north of Westin is busy and I even saw a red eel. Breakfast is huge with traditional food, lots of eggs, bacon, potatoes, omelet bar, juice, pastries, all the coffee, etc. You can rent snorkel stuff. Great shower! Refrigerators in more expensive rooms. Early check-in & noon check-out. Restaurant prices same as in town. We loved sunset and star gazing from the recliners. Standard taxi fare from town is always $150MX. If you are in a big group, our friends recommend getting a condo at Summerplace Inn. 

Ferry: XCaret -  newest & cheapest, leaves every 1/2 hour. Trying to beat competition by costing less, being more convenient and faster. Smaller boat though. We only bought ‚Äúida‚Äù one way just to be safe from complications. Note: we left from Playa Del Carmel. The ferry is within walking distance to ADO bus stop. 

Getting there: ADO buses are so easy. We took them all over the peninsula. About US$11 to/from the airport.  Terminal is right by the ferry pier. Getting away they deliver you straight to your terminal. If you end up at the wrong place, there is a free shuttle every 15 minutes. Don‚Äôt pay a taxi. Side note: we heard of a scam of taxis delivering you to the wrong terminal on purpose so they then can charge US$20 to get you to the right terminal, which is very likely in walking distance. Take the three hour before your flight warning seriously. It can take a while to get through security, etc. We had a 12:30p flight to Dallas from Cancun airport, got there at 9 and had no issues. It was a long wait at the airport but no stress. Bring food. Everything to eat is US airport prices. 

Diving: Deep Blue - 30yrs in business. Polyglot instructors & Masters. Gigi Larson is an outstanding teacher and nice person. Everyone there was great and they let us take fins and snorkeling stuff with us each day so we could snorkel at our hotel. No charge to use computer or flashlight and they have a rustic shower. Fruit snacks so you feel healthy. Accommodate nicely for the terrain you want to see: wall, hills, swim throughs, wildlife rich areas, sculptural forms and corals. Our hard core diving friends always use them and say they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mess around‚Äù and find the best stuff and care about you having a good time. Competitive pricing but perks push them way beyond others. My diving friends told me never to use a shop attached to a hotel. I‚Äôm not sure why, but she is adamant. 

Restaurants: La Candela, La Lechona (?) across from Deep Blue. Great anchiote marinated fish, but it feels a bit like murder after diving all day. Good rellenos too. 
Non tourist area with fruit stands and street food (feels more like normal Mexico) is on road connecting to east part of the island or north of town on the way to Playa Azul. Fruit markets are worth stocking up from. I had never had their ‚Äúciruela,‚Äù which is not quite plum, like I know it to be in Spanish, but a little fruit with a big seed. It looks kind of like a loquat combined with a cumquat, but not citrus. You can eat the skin. If you like hot, don‚Äôt miss the wonderful habanero hot sauce they have everywhere. Delicious!

Touring the Island: East side is worth seeing for its white beaches and spicy waves. Food is all around $400MX, so pack a snack if you want to save. However, you can park in a better spot if you at least get a bear or $7US cold coconut. Everyone says to go to Coconuts for the view and mojitos, but we passed. Rented a car arranged by our hotel. HTL Rental. $55/day for a manual ‚ÄúMarch‚Äù Nissan budget card. Sprang for $35 insurance peace of mind, but that doesn‚Äôt cover broken windows if someone does a sash & grab, which can happen if you leave valuables obvious in some areas, especially in slow season. They were nice and easy. No sneaky feeling and no tax, even if we used a credit card. 

Money: Cozumel is the most expensive place we went, but it is an island. Always break a MX$500 when you can because it is a big deal when you are buying small things. Exchange rate for cash is better here than anywhere else (bad in Playa Del Carmen), but cash machines work if you accept the ‚Äò90s prices of $4-$5 fee to withdraw. :)

Conclusions: if you want to snorkel and see beneath the surface, Cozumel is the best. The mainland is just busy and it seems as if the thing to do in PDC is go somewhere else, like Cenotes, ruins or the XCaret world of adventure (which looks really fun, just more intense than we were wanting to experience this time around). 

I hope these help someone. ",2,1730303075.0,cozumel,0,1.0,False

It all started when I was 18 and started working a full time job for the first time. I was not catching up on sleep, so to compensate for my tiredness on work I'd drink an energy drink and go on with the day. I started liking the taste of it, and over the next few months I was drinking at least 2 per day. After about a year I got laid off from work and decided I don't need caffeine anymore. I didn't drink it for days and I felt absolutely awful for those few days. It wasn't going away , therefore I decided not to quit and went back to caffeine. Over time , not even 2 energy drinks were enough, so I started drinking 3 per day. Then I started consuming coffee , which I usually didn't like in the past, just so I could get enough caffeine. Now I'm at the point where I need 3-4 energy drinks per day, as well as a couple of coffees. It's so bad that when I go to the grocery store, I take an energy drink and lead the label on the can to see the caffeine content. If it's under 150mg I don't buy it. I'm addicted to nicotine as well, but it's nowhere near my caffeine addiction intensity. I don't feel normal when I take under 500mg of caffeine per day , I would feel like I haven't slept in days.

Make sure to do your research before deciding if this is right for you!

I should note that I started a ketogenic diet about 7 years ago and stuck to it successfully for about 4 years. I lost 80lbs and was happy and healthy. I started getting lazy with my diet, and excuse after excuse to give in to things I felt like eating again and now Im right back where I started. It was a great overall experience though and I was disciplined for several years. My PCP doctor is very familiar with my history and suggested I try a GLP-1 medication since I am struggling primarily with food noise and self control. I have proven in the past I CAN be responsible and make sustainable choices, but the hardest part was ignoring the food noise. So, here I am. My doctor can write me a script, but my insurance does not cover this so Hers was the best option I could find, though I have thoughts of what my future will look like because this is very expensive. 

I signed up for the 6-month plan. It was easy, and I was approved like 20 minutes after I submitted everything. Ordered on a Saturday, they shipped Monday and I received it Wednesday. They sent me all 6 vials in a large box along with everything I need. It was cold packed and included a water bottle. 

Week 1 of the Hers Semaglutide injection, 8 units.

I started last Wednesday, and I am down about 7 lbs. 35/F, 5'5"", SW 251, CW 244

The actual injection was very easy. Painless. I injected in my stomach after eating dinner. It felt cooling like menthol almost for an hour or two after the shot. The first night I already felt immediate reduction in food noise. I ate nothing else that night and didn't have a desire for a snack either. 

The entire week was like this for the most part. The only side effects Ive had are some headaches but I think that mostly because of my water intake. I am working on it though! No real stomach or digestive issues. I did go out to eat one night and was grossly full for hours after that and didn't eat until noon the next day. Eating after dinner hasn't really been an issue, and the only nights it has I was still under on calories for the day so it made sense to me and I opted for a healthy snack like an Apple or greek yogurt. 

I'll be honest, I feel exactly like how I did when I was on the Keto diet at the start. The fat helped me stay satiated so I wasn't hungry all the time. However, I did still WANT to eat foods that were not necessarily unhealthy but were not low carb. With GLP-1 I am incorporating lots of grains, fruits and yogurts. Things I couldn't have on Keto. This is making me excited to eat with more options and its easy to pick healthier things that are higher in protein. I am still being conscious of carbs. I don't add sweeteners to anything unless its liquid stevia and I don't think I did that at all this week. 

My coffee intake is also way lower... which, is amazing? I drink a fucking LOT of coffee, and I find myself just being content with a cup in the morning. Who even am I? If I find myself wanting coffee later in the day I try to make myself grab a bottle of water instead and so far its been working. Im also enjoying overnight oats. Delicious and filling. I have a bunch of recipes bookmarked and looking forward to experimenting a bit with healthy foods.

My goals are:

* Drink more water
* Drink less coffee
* Get more sleep
* Return to my goal weight of 160. My body was happy there. I felt good, and I was happy with how I looked.

I should also note I am tracking my food. I did not the first few days, I just wanted to adjust and listen to my body and was blown away how not hungry I was and I was eating so much less. After a few days I jumped into my Cronometer app and use that to track and have my macros setup with a 500 calorie deficit and focus on protein with fats and carbs being equal. I am less concerned about that, and more concerned about getting my protein in. Its hard to shake the low carb mindset entirely but Id like to have a healthy relationship with carbs again. If I am getting my carbs from fruits and grains primarily I am happy with that. 

I am not entirely sure if I will stick with Hers throughout it all, as I am realizing I could have potentially gotten better deals. However, for initially starting it they have been great. I am concerned that they charge more for increased dose over 1.2mg and most other providers I see do NOT charge more for that, so at 6 months I will see if Hers changing how they do increases to stay competitive. Im also a little worried about changing at that point and maybe no longer qualifying and how that is going to work in the longterm. This is stuff not to worry about today, but I do like to keep it in the back of my mind and curious what others will do who approach maintenance doses that need more.  

So there it is. Week 1 done. Looking forward to week 2. I'll probably post another update after a month or so unless something drastic changes between now and then.

My aim was for quality & diversity over quantity. There are a couple of exclusions such as Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn, which I'm not willing to pay north of $120 for a CIB great condition copy of at this time. Also there are a few stellar games such as Okami & No More Heroes that I own on other platforms and am very happy with those other versions, so I chose not to repurchase for Wii. And in case you were wondering, the dancing/music games never appealed much to me, so that's why you don't see those present. But other than those caveats, what do you think? This is not a display-only type of collection either, I still play my Wii on a regular basis. My Wii controller has a permanent home on my coffee table and I have 4 motion-plus controllers which I use to frequently force my friends to play Wii games when they are at my home.

My(55 F) friend (35 M) has a 10 year old son, who for the past month on the weekends would go beyond his curfew of 9 pm to get off the computer and get ready for bed by 10 pm. He would get off the computer like around midnight but in the middle of the night, my friend would hear his son's computer turn on around 3 am.

I went over to bring him some boxes as he and his son are moving to a new apartment in a new city in three weeks. While we were sitting down and drinking coffee and shooting the breeze about the joys of moving, thankfully, he had paid vacation time and PTO that he hadn't used up yet. He made mention about his son on the weekends staying up past his 9 pm curfew on getting off the computer to get ready for bed and then hearing him get up in the middle of the night to play on the computer.

I made an offhand suggestion about setting a timer for his computer to turn off. He looked at me like I grew two heads. He asked is that even possible?

I was like yeah, just look on the computer. We had to look up how to put it on, by googling it. He never knew he could set a timer for the computer to turn off. He even googled if it was possible to set the timer to allow the computer to be turned on, I didn't even think that was possible, till we found it on google.

So we got the son's computer set to turn off at 9 pm and wake up at 6 am.

He was very proud of himself for setting it up. I had told him that his son will get used to the boundaries now. Do tell him the consequences of his actions has warranted a new punishment if he doesn't follow curfew by getting off the computer by 9 pm.

Well, I got a phone call that night from my friend, his son was ticked off about his computer turning off at 9 pm. I could hear his son screaming at him for being a bad father and that he's going to be reported for this at school. I told him, the school won't do anything beyond asking what you did, might want to drop him off and go speak with the principal about this, so whatever your son tries to get you into trouble, would be canceled out by you talking to the principal and the teacher probably would be sent a message pertaining to him so he cannot get you into any trouble since this happens at the library and at our school computers too.

My friend asked me if we did the right thing by doing this to him. I told him we did the right thing, he has to learn how to make due with the time he has on the computer before it shuts down, like he has to when he goes to the public library on Saturday, as the computers there shuts down at 4:45 pm.

His son has been constantly screaming at him for allowing me to destroy his computer time, and it is constant for the last two weeks. I seriously feel like I am the AH in this as I cheated his son out of being responsible with his computer time, but his dad asked me for advice and I gave it and his dad did it.",7,1730302455.0,AmItheAsshole,17,1.0,False

Recently, I enrolled in a class that I was really excited about, taught by one of my professors. He‚Äôs well-respected and has a reputation for being a great teacher, but I noticed that he had a slightly different demeanor with me compared to other students.

At first, I thought it was just my imagination. He would engage with me a bit more during lectures and often asked for my opinion on class discussions. However, things took a turn when he started messaging me on a social media platform after class. Initially, the messages were about class-related topics, which I thought was fine. But then, the tone changed.

One day, he sent me a message that said, ‚ÄúI have to admit, I‚Äôve developed a bit of a crush on you. You‚Äôre so bright and talented.‚Äù I was taken aback. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. Part of me felt flattered, but another part felt uncomfortable. It‚Äôs one thing for a teacher to be friendly and supportive, but crossing that line into personal feelings made me uneasy.

After thinking it over, I decided to address the situation. I replied, ‚ÄúThank you for your kind words, but I think it‚Äôs important for us to keep our relationship professional. I respect you as my teacher and want to focus on my studies.‚Äù I hoped that would be the end of it.

However, he didn‚Äôt take my response well. He continued to send messages that felt increasingly inappropriate. He‚Äôd comment on my appearance and suggest we grab coffee to discuss my career aspirations. I felt trapped because he was still my professor, and I didn‚Äôt want to create a scene or make things awkward in class.

Feeling stressed, I spoke to a trusted friend about it, and she advised me to report his behavior to the administration. I was hesitant, fearing it would ruin his career or make things uncomfortable for me. But I also knew that what he was doing wasn‚Äôt right.

Eventually, I made the difficult decision to report him. The school took my complaint seriously and initiated an investigation. They assured me that my safety and comfort were their top priorities. He was temporarily suspended while they looked into the situation, and I felt a mix of relief and guilt.

Now, I‚Äôm left wondering if I did the right thing. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt his career, but I felt I had no choice to protect myself. AITA for reporting my teacher after he confessed he had a crush on me?",138,1730302388.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,67,0.95,False

These spells go side by side: 
Road opener & Reconcile/come back to me 

They are to be worked for 7 days so 7 day candles are best I‚Äôll list the ingredients and the candles, herbs and oils used. 

Road opener: 

1 orange 7 day candle 
Oils: road opener oil 
Colognes: love cologne 
Herbs: red sandlewood for clearing mind of negativity and focusing on positive only. 
Lemon grass for promoting communication, open roads  
Nettle leaf for dispelling fear and healing 

You can crush these up in a mortar and put them inside of the candle and also when you anoint your petition with road opener oil  put the remaining inside and fold it towards you. Put packet under burning candle for 7days. 
(Dispose of how you like, I burn mine and keep it in empty 7 day candle) poke 3 holes in the candle so oils and herbs can be stuffed inside. 

Reconcile/come back to me: 

Candle: 7 day pink candle 
Oils: come back to me , irresistible me, love & attraction 
Herbs: honey, quassia chips, Damiana, licorice root, lavender, catnip and rose petal dried. 
Cologne: love (botanic shops have these)

Honey to sweeten 
Quassia for love and controlling a situation
Lavender for a calming effect 
Catnip for promoting love 
Damiana to bring a loved one back 
Licorice root to attract a lover 
Rose petal for more love (I added from a bouquet I got for my bday) 
Coffee for speedy results. 


Make your petition add these herbs as well. 
How ever you make your petition you make it your way. And you add the herbs make a packet and place under candle for 7 days.

1gfoxhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestbeautybuys/comments/1gfoxhv/honest_i_tested_the_maybelline_super_stay_ink/,[HONEST] I Tested The MAYBELLINE Super Stay Ink Crayon Lipstick: Best Matte Lip Color Yet?,"Looking for a reliable, long-lasting lipstick? I recently tried the Maybelline Super Stay Ink Crayon, and I'm impressed with its performance.

This matte lip crayon promises up to 8 hours of wear, and I found it lived up to that claim. The crayon-like design makes it easy to apply, and I love that it has a built-in sharpener to keep the tip precise. I used the shade ""Lead The Way,"" a pretty pink beige that's perfect for everyday wear.

https://preview.redd.it/70fsztmytwxd1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd80a0e10913cd616cb0e5d64f831762e51b5fd5

I noticed the color stayed put even after eating and drinking. It didn't transfer onto my coffee cup, which is a big plus. The formula feels creamy when applied, but it does dry down to a matte finish. Some users might find it a bit drying, so using a lip balm underneath could help.

One thing I really like is how pigmented the color is. It only takes one swipe for full coverage. The crayon tip also makes it easy to line and fill in lips without needing a separate lip liner.

# Bottom Line

If you want a long-lasting matte lipstick that's easy to apply, the Maybelline Super Stay Ink Crayon is a great choice. It offers bold color that stays put all day.



# Overview of Maybelline Super Stay Ink Crayon Lipstick

I recently tried the Super Stay Ink Crayon from Maybelline, and I'm impressed. This lip crayon glides on smoothly and provides rich matte color that lasts up to 8 hours. The precision tip makes it easy to line and fill lips in one swipe. I like the built-in sharpener that keeps the tip precise for touch-ups on the go.

The ""Lead The Way"" shade is a pretty pink beige that works well for everyday wear. While the long-lasting formula is great, it can feel a bit dry after several hours. I found applying lip balm first helps with comfort.

One downside is that it can be tricky to remove at the end of the day. Overall, this crayon lipstick is a good option if you want bold color that stays put all day without constant reapplying.

# Easy Application and Precision

I found this lip crayon a breeze to use. The precision tip lets me line my lips easily and fill them in without a mess. It glides on smoothly, feeling creamy as I apply it. The built-in sharpener is handy - I can keep the tip pointed for crisp lines. One swipe gives rich color, so I don't need to go over it many times. The matte finish looks great and stays put for hours. I like that I can draw it on quickly when I'm in a rush. While it's not the most moisturizing, the smooth application makes up for it. The crayon shape gives me good control, letting me get a neat lip look with minimal effort.

# Long-Lasting Matte Finish

I put this lip crayon to the test and was impressed by its staying power. The matte finish lasted for hours without needing touchups. Even after eating and drinking, most of the color stayed put. I noticed very little transfer onto my coffee cup, which is a big plus. The formula does feel a bit dry on the lips after a while. I found applying some lip balm first helped with comfort. While it may not quite reach the full 8 hours claimed, the longevity is still very good for a matte lip product. The built-in sharpener is handy for keeping the tip precise for easy application on-the-go.

# Built-In Sharpener Convenience

I love how this lip crayon takes the hassle out of touch-ups. The built-in sharpener is a game-changer. It keeps the tip precise, so I can easily outline and fill my lips in one go. No more fumbling for a separate sharpener or dealing with dull tips. The crayon glides on smoothly, and I can quickly touch up my color anywhere. It's perfect for on-the-go use. The sharpener ensures I always have a clean edge for precise application. This clever feature adds to the overall ease of use and makes the lip crayon stand out from others I've tried.

# Variety of Vibrant Shades

I was amazed by the range of colors in this lip crayon collection. The Lead The Way shade is a pretty pink beige that looks great on many skin tones. It's perfect for everyday wear. I found that the matte finish looks smooth and doesn't dry out my lips. The crayon tip makes it easy to apply the color evenly. I like that I can build up the intensity for a bolder look or keep it light for a subtle tint. The long-lasting formula really does stay put for hours without fading or smudging. My only wish is that they offered even more shade options to choose from.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this Maybelline lip crayon for a while now, and I've got some thoughts to share. Here's what I've found:

# Pros

* Long-lasting color: The lip crayon stays on for hours, even after eating and drinking.
* Easy application: The crayon shape makes it simple to apply and outline lips.
* Built-in sharpener: Keeps the tip precise for neat application.
* Pigmented color: Rich, bold shades that show up well on lips.
* Matte finish: Gives a modern, non-shiny look.
* Good value: Affordable price for the quality.

# Cons

* Can be drying: Some users might find it a bit drying on the lips.
* Slight stickiness: The formula can feel a bit tacky at first.
* Limited shade range: While there are several colors, some users might want more options.
* Transfer: It can transfer a bit, though less than many other lipsticks.

This lip crayon is a solid choice for those who want long-wearing color without constant touch-ups. I like how it glides on smoothly and stays put for most of the day. The built-in sharpener is a nice touch, making it easy to keep the tip precise.

On the flip side, it can feel a bit dry after a few hours. I sometimes pair it with a lip balm or gloss to add some moisture. The slight stickiness isn't a deal-breaker for me, but it's worth noting.

Overall, I think this Maybelline lip crayon offers good quality for its price point. It's become a go-to in my makeup routine for days when I need my lip color to last.

# Customer Reviews

I've been using this Super Stay Ink Crayon for a while now, and I'm impressed. Many users love how easy it is to apply, with its creamy texture and precision tip. The pigment is strong, and the color stays put for hours. I noticed it even lasts through meals and doesn't transfer to coffee cups.

Some folks find it a bit drying, so I sometimes pair it with lip balm. The built-in sharpener is handy. While it may not last the full 8 hours for everyone, it does have good staying power.

Users seem to enjoy the color range, with many repurchasing their favorites. The price on Amazon is often better than in stores. Overall, people are happy with this lip crayon, praising its smooth application and long-lasting color.

# Conclusion

The Super Stay Ink Crayon is a solid choice for long-lasting lip color. I found it easy to apply and appreciated the built-in sharpener. The color payoff is impressive, and it stayed put for several hours. While it can be a bit drying, pairing it with a lip balm helped. The price on Amazon is a plus. It's not perfect, but for the quality and longevity, it's a good value. If you're looking for a matte lip product that won't budge through meals and coffee, this crayon is worth trying.",1,1730301259.0,bestbeautybuys,0,1.0,False

Every time I tried to focus on my studies, his image would creep back, bringing with it that weird feeling he‚Äôd left in my chest. It wasn‚Äôt just his gaze or his voice‚Äîit was everything about him, that mix of mystery, like he knew something I didn‚Äôt. I tried to tell myself it was just a casual conversation, that it didn‚Äôt mean anything, but I wasn‚Äôt fooling myself. There was something else there, something that pulled me in, and I had no idea why.

A week later, I went back to the library. Part of me hoped he‚Äôd be there, like he‚Äôd just appear out of nowhere, reading another one of those old books full of secrets. I wandered through the same aisles, even sat at the same table where we‚Äôd talked, pretending to read, though honestly, I was just thinking about him and that strange connection I‚Äôd felt. But he wasn‚Äôt there.

Nearly resigned, I decided to leave. I walked toward the exit, disappointed, though I tried to convince myself it didn‚Äôt matter. And just then, I heard a familiar voice behind me.

‚ÄúBack looking for mysteries?‚Äù

I turned, and there he was, looking at me with that same expression‚Äîhalf curious, half‚Ä¶ something I couldn‚Äôt quite place. My pulse sped up, and I tried to play it cool, though I wasn‚Äôt sure how well I was hiding my nerves.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I said, trying to sound casual. ‚ÄúOr maybe I just like this place.‚Äù

He smiled, a knowing smile, like he could see right through me. He invited me to get coffee at a little caf√© just across the street. Without thinking too much, I said yes. It made me a little nervous, but I couldn‚Äôt resist. There was something about him, like a magnet pulling me in.

The caf√© was cozy, with wooden tables and warm lights. We sat in a corner, where the noise from the other people faded into a distant hum, leaving us in this strange little bubble. For the first few minutes, we kept it light‚Äîtalking about university, books, random things that didn‚Äôt matter. But as time went on, his voice got lower, like he was sharing a secret.

He told me things about the book from the library, stories about old writers and dark thoughts on life and love. He spoke with so much intensity that I hung on to every word. Sometimes his eyes locked onto mine in a way that made my skin tingle. In those moments, it felt like the rest of the world disappeared, and it was just us, completely isolated.

It was during one of those silences that I felt his hand brush against mine, just the lightest touch, but firm. My breath stopped for a second. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was on purpose or an accident, but I didn‚Äôt pull my hand away. There was an uncomfortable, charged silence, full of something I hadn‚Äôt felt before. In that tiny touch, it felt like he‚Äôd said everything words couldn‚Äôt.

When he finally got up, the tension between us was almost overwhelming. He looked at me, holding my gaze a bit longer than necessary, then whispered something that sent a chill down my spine:

‚ÄúSometimes, mysteries are more dangerous than they seem.‚Äù

And with that, he said goodbye, leaving me there, tangled in a mess of emotions I couldn‚Äôt quite process. There was something dark about him, something that pulled me in and, at the same time, felt like playing with fire",9,1730301162.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

 i realized i was completely constipated, bloating, pain, not digesting properly, gas that was trapped. this went on & i was spiraling trying to figure out what was wrong. i asked to see my doctor right away & they said not until december. so i went to the hospital, the 24th & they ran tests & did a CT scan. at this point i hadnt eaten for days besides a little rice because even water was giving trapped gas & messing w me. they said tests were normal & that i had almost completely cleared myself out, that i had a stomach virus (not sure if it was fact or they assumed) & the imodium trapped it in my system making everything worse. also diagnosed w pericardial effusion (fluid formed around heart & putting pressure on it, i already have a slight heart problem & i looked it up & this can be from a virus or other things) so they referred me to cardiology. i was supposed to start period according to flo app the next week but i noticed very dry blood trying to use the bathroom after the imodium. i went home thinking okay i have my answer i just need this to pass, it got a lot better over the weekend & i thought it was over. when i looked up pericardial effusion it said the first line of treatment was 600 mg ibuprofen i think 3 times a day? that seemed like alot to me so i was going to do it once a day. i took it monday & felt great, i drank a coffee to relieve constipation which worked, then i was messed up the rest of the day just like before only no pain. bloating, stomach noises, trapped gas that made my stomach loud, couldnt eat or drink. i spent the day spiraling trying to figure out what was wrong thinking i have SIBO & that this would be a never ending battle. at the end of the day when the ibuprofen wore off BOOM period cramps & extreme red blood flow and it clicked. this was my PERIOD all along. the ibuprofen had stopped it up. the imodium stopped it up. & im not sure but i think maybe i didnt have a virus, maybe my period is causing all of this because the pap smear made me completely irregular. since it wore off ive been in extreme pain. this has been hell & i thought i was going insane, but now idk what to do. no way can i deal w this again its been 2 & a half weeks. i cant keep missing school that i just started. thoughts? should i be put on birth control to regulate?",2,1730300945.0,Periods,0,1.0,False

I am fine with a manufacturer applying a recognized quality mark, be it the Lacoste alligator (really a croc), Rolex, Mercedes, or any other licensed logo that is worth something TO ME as an enhancement that may impress onlookers because so much has been invested by the brand into developing a favorable reputation.  At Amazon, where zero has been invested in developing the brand and the expectation is that the brand should benefit from displaying on my counter or body, that is ludicrous and diminishes the product's worth and my ownership satisfaction.

Having said all that, as a Vine Voice I am now the not so proud owner of a ton of low end products screaming their unpronounceable names in sharp relief.  I want to take matters into my own hands and find a workaround.  For example, I've been able to peel off some conspicuous stuck-on product labels.  I'm writing now to ask others:  **has anyone found a place to buy convincing looking labeling that you can attach to overwrite the nonsense brand name prominently displayed?**  I know that logo embossed leather is, as they say, FUBAR, along with embroidered *de facto* graffiti.  But what of kitchen appliances and electronics?  For example, can you find a nice and official looking and easy to apply sticker bearing the Nespresso name and logo convincingly over CHULUX, KIDISLE and the like so that you can not be ashamed to let friends see your kitchen?

By the way, as an editorial aside, some of these no-name companies seem to be actual, established companies.  I would've imagined they were fly-by-night single product companies that all bought their goods from the same factory and slapped on made up logos just to sell off the inventory.  But CHULUX is an actual coffee maker manufacturer with a 20 year history.  The right way, in my view, to develop a brand reputation and following is to *not ostentatiously* print your name on the bottom of the product or the back, and over time if it's quality people will remember and seek you out for further purchases and tell their friends and relatives.  Omega got its name by first making excellent watches but they only became a status symbol that owners wanted for name dropping value after a long time developing reputation through consistent quality and style and by advertising heavily with product placement in James Bond movies, etc.  Not by churning out cheap crap and sticking a huge logo on it, because no one would want such a thing.  Amazon seems to have broken vendors' realization of that simple point.

The old diner sat at the edge of town, where the streetlights ended, and the highway began. A flickering neon sign that read ‚ÄúJerry‚Äôs 24-Hour Diner‚Äù hummed quietly in the night, though most letters had faded to a dull glow. Nobody knew exactly how long the place had been open‚ÄîJerry himself had passed away years ago, but the diner remained under the care of a grumpy old cook named Tom.

Tom was the only one stubborn enough to keep the doors open during the midnight shift. He was getting old, but he swore he‚Äôd rather die flipping burgers than retire. A single waitress, Gina, kept him company most nights. They only saw a few truckers or late-night drunks stumbling in, and some locals swore the place was cursed. It didn‚Äôt help that weird things always happened after midnight.

It was a quiet Tuesday night when it all started.


---

1:07 AM

The diner was empty, save for Gina wiping down the counters. She sighed, glancing toward Tom through the small kitchen window as he worked over the grill.

‚ÄúYou think we‚Äôll get anyone tonight?‚Äù she asked.

Tom snorted without looking up. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre lucky, no.‚Äù

The door chime jingled, and Gina cursed under her breath. A man in a rain-soaked jacket shuffled inside, dragging wet footprints across the floor. He looked haggard, like someone who hadn‚Äôt slept in days. Without a word, he sat at the farthest booth, keeping his head low.

Gina grabbed a menu and made her way toward him. ‚ÄúWelcome to Jerry‚Äôs. Can I get you‚Äî‚Äù

The man raised his hand, stopping her mid-sentence. ‚ÄúJust coffee,‚Äù he muttered, voice gravelly. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

She nodded and hurried back to the counter. When she poured the coffee, she noticed something strange: the man‚Äôs reflection in the window beside the booth. It was faint, distorted, as though the glass was warped‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt the same man sitting at the table. The figure in the reflection was grinning, teeth long and too white, even though the man himself wasn‚Äôt smiling at all.

Gina blinked, and the reflection shifted back to normal. She shook her head, brushing it off as exhaustion, and carried the coffee over.


---

2:13 AM

The rain hadn‚Äôt let up. Thunder rumbled in the distance, shaking the windows. The man with the coffee was still sitting in the same booth, staring into the cup as though it held some terrible secret. Gina had tried to engage him, but he wouldn‚Äôt talk beyond a nod or a grunt. She figured he was just passing through‚Äîuntil the lights flickered.

The fluorescent bulbs buzzed and dimmed for a moment before steadying. Gina glanced at the clock on the wall: 2:13 AM.

Tom cursed from the kitchen. ‚ÄúDamn lights.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been acting weird all week,‚Äù Gina replied, but there was a knot forming in her stomach.

The man in the booth suddenly shifted, his eyes snapping toward the kitchen window where Tom was visible. A strange smile curled his lips for the first time that night.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs in the kitchen?‚Äù the man asked.

Gina hesitated. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just Tom, our cook.‚Äù

The man‚Äôs grin widened. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt go back there if I were you.‚Äù

A chill ran down Gina‚Äôs spine. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

The man didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, he slowly stirred his coffee with a spoon, his eyes glazed over like he was watching something only he could see.


---

2:34 AM

Gina couldn‚Äôt shake the unease. She had tried calling Tom through the kitchen window, but the old cook hadn‚Äôt responded. She figured he was busy prepping something‚Äîbut then the lights flickered again, longer this time. The overhead hum of electricity faltered, and in that brief moment of darkness, Gina heard the sound of something scraping along the kitchen floor.

When the lights came back on, the booth where the man had been sitting was empty. His coffee cup sat untouched, steam still curling from its surface.

‚ÄúTom?‚Äù Gina called, her voice trembling.

No answer.

She felt a knot twist tighter in her gut. Slowly, she pushed through the swinging door into the kitchen, and the metallic scent of raw meat hit her. At first, she thought it was just the burgers, but the smell was too sharp, too wrong.

Then she saw the floor.

There were deep scratches in the linoleum, long grooves running from the back door toward the grill station, as if something heavy had been dragged across it.

‚ÄúTom?‚Äù she whispered again.

A shadow moved at the far end of the kitchen. Gina turned, her heart pounding in her chest‚Äîand froze.

It wasn‚Äôt Tom.

A figure stood in the dim light, hunched and twitching. Its back was to her, and it wore Tom‚Äôs stained apron, but the proportions were all wrong. Its arms were too long, fingers splayed unnaturally over the counter. The creature shifted slightly, and Gina caught a glimpse of something horrid: Tom‚Äôs head‚Äîtilted at an impossible angle, his eyes vacant, mouth hanging open in a slack grin. It was as if his body was being worn like a costume.

A noise escaped her throat, something between a gasp and a sob. The figure turned slowly, revealing a face she couldn‚Äôt understand. It was Tom‚Äôs, but stretched too thin, as though someone else was wearing his skin. And beneath the human mask, something dark shimmered‚Äîan ancient presence, gleaming with malevolent intent.

Andras.

The name dropped into Gina‚Äôs mind like a stone into water, rippling through her thoughts without explanation. She had never heard it before, yet she knew. Andras, the demon of discord, rider of nightmares, commander of thirty legions.

The thing that had taken Tom wasn‚Äôt just some ghost. It was something far worse.


---

3:03 AM

Gina stumbled backward, tripping over a bucket of grease. The creature wearing Tom's skin let out a guttural laugh, the sound reverberating like nails dragged across a chalkboard.

‚ÄúLeaving so soon?‚Äù it hissed, though its voice was an awful mixture‚Äîpart Tom, part something ancient and cold.

Gina scrambled to her feet and bolted through the kitchen door, her breath coming in ragged gasps. She reached the dining area and slammed the door shut behind her, shoving a chair under the handle. The lights above flickered wildly now, as though the wiring itself had become corrupted by the presence in the diner.

From the other side of the door, the creature laughed again, the sound making her skin crawl. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt run,‚Äù it whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll peel you open just like I did him.‚Äù

Gina grabbed her phone, hands shaking. She tried to dial 911, but the screen flickered and died. The air around her felt heavy, suffocating, as if the diner had slipped into another world‚Äîa world ruled by Andras.

The windows rattled as the storm outside intensified. Rain pelted the glass, but it sounded more like nails scraping against the panes. The neon sign outside buzzed loudly, then shattered, plunging the parking lot into total darkness.

Gina backed away from the door, heart hammering. She could hear footsteps now‚Äîslow, deliberate, like a predator toying with prey.

The chair wedged under the door handle began to creak as something pushed against it from the other side.


---

3:33 AM

Gina knew she had to get out. Her eyes darted toward the emergency exit near the back of the diner, but something about it felt wrong. The shadows seemed to pool thicker around that door, as if it led somewhere worse than death.

Then the lights cut out entirely.

The diner was plunged into pitch-black darkness, and Gina‚Äôs breath hitched in her throat. She fumbled for her phone‚Äôs flashlight, but just as she turned it on, the beam caught something moving in the corner of the room.

The man from earlier‚Äîthe one who had ordered coffee‚Äîwas standing there, perfectly still, his head tilted at an unnatural angle. His eyes gleamed in the dim light, not with fear, but with knowledge.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have stayed,‚Äù he whispered.

Before Gina could react, the door to the kitchen burst open with a deafening crack. The thing wearing Tom‚Äôs skin crawled through the opening, its limbs jerking unnaturally as if learning how to move in its borrowed body. The mask of Tom's face sagged, revealing glimpses of something far worse underneath‚Äîhorns curling along a misshapen skull, teeth too sharp for a human mouth, and eyes burning with the fires of some ancient inferno.

Gina screamed, but the sound was swallowed by the darkness.


---

4:06 AM

No one heard Gina's cries.

When the morning crew arrived at the diner, the place was eerily quiet. The rain had stopped, and the neon sign lay in pieces on the ground. Inside, everything seemed normal at first‚Äîuntil they found the kitchen.

Tom‚Äôs body was slumped against the grill, his face frozen in a grotesque grin. His skin had been flayed open, every inch of it carved with symbols no one could understand. And Gina?

She was never found.

All that remained was her name scrawled across the booth where the strange man had sat‚Äîwritten backward, as if by a hand that didn‚Äôt belong to any human. Beneath it was a single word:

Andras.

The diner closed for good after that night. The townspeople whispered about what had happened, but no one

1gfoiy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1gfoiy2/is_my_husband_a_bad_guy_or_is_it_me/,Is my husband a bad guy or is it me,"It's a long story as to how we got here. I don't want to share anything unneccessary but I also don't want to leave out anything that is important enough that it sheds light and leads to understanding anything I currently personally do not. I do not know if I am the problem, if my husband is, or if we just aren't meant to be.

It started in the beginning with us agreeing on certain terms before getting engaged / married. Some small things and some big. For instance, I am very traditional and he said he was as well. Even though he came from states away surrounded by mostly friends and family who were not. Whereas I am from the south surrounded by traditional marriages. Which is what I wanted and needed to know he did as well or obviously we are not equally yolked and it could cause problem later. When we met he was a truck driver, gone from home 3 weeks at a time and driving 8-11 hours a day and not afraid to get his hands dirty to load and unload his haul. From my perspective - he easily checked the hard working / provrider type man I wanted. I went with him on the road a few days after we met (I wasn't in the best place and didn't care if he kidnapped me lol) I was 21 and him 27. I owned my home I bought at 19 along with anything else - I had no payments and no debts so I was free. I made enough money with my small cleaning business to cover any bills and then some. When I went with him on the road I would rub his back, hand feed him while he drove, have sex anytime he wanted in the truck, never complained, never asked him to stop so I could pee - I did my best to be helpful on the road, be a good friends / companion / and not doing anything to hinder his work. To me, what a wife should and what I wanted him to know I was and wanted to be. He showed me attention, held my hand, cuddled in the truck, and worked hard. I did not get to date him outside of his trucker lifestyle. He also did not share much about his life before me,

We get married and the trucker thing doesn't work out. Which he said he saw coming for a long while and I am not sure why he held on so long or why he decided for sure it was over. I loved being on the road with him. So it was not my preference, but we agreed to quit trucking and he was going to move into my house and help me with my  cleaning business. As soon as he moves in he gets depressed. I understand it - but he did nit to himself. He did it for years and saw how it was going for him and other truckers who worked for the same people. Something very similiar happened to me just before it did him and before we started dating - I didn't act like he did. So why does a man get to marry a woman years younger than himself, has her own home paid off, paid off truck, two business, 40k saved up, and a mindset to be the best wife she can and is excited for it and her willingly give it all to him to take over as the man a leader of the home - but treat her like she means very little to him and he isn't thankful to have her or excited anymore? He stayed in bed mostly and plays video games. I just laid there next to him for the most part. I do all the cleaning, cooking, and running the business and taking care of the dogs. This goes on for roughly 4 months before I start getting upset and opening my mouth. Oh and by the way - no sex what so ever. He doesn't make a move on me for months. He is a major stonewaller. Takes offense to everything I say. Takes everything personal and as an attack on him. From the beginning has said stuff like ""Oh when things just aren't going exactly the way (my name) wants it not (my name) world anymore"" and is super sarcastic. I can remember laying in bed next to him sad we hadn't gone on any dates in months and we were newly wed. So I told him I wanted to, asked him if he did and if not why didn't he want to, etc etc. Basically he stonewalled and then says stuff like ""oh no that sucks"" ""I'm not good enough for you"" ""get over it"" and I lay there confused and crying while he falls asleep, literally snoring moments later. He is angry most mornings, quite consistently. It's no better now since we have an 8 month old. He hates getting up to do the morning feed. Our baby is amazing, he started sleeping all the way through the nice quick and easy. He gets up at 8am most mornings to be fed. THAT is somehow too early for my husband. As I write this, I am up again by myself and with my baby. Fixing to work on invoices for my business and make the scheduele. Been up since 8am and it's 9:45am. He is still asleep. Which is weird cause all he did was run some errands and stay home with our baby while I painted at a house we are flipping most the day, but he always sleeps longer than me. He has said that since I am taken care of financially, he can do whatever he wants. He took over the cleaning company about a year or so into marriage. It has grown and we are making more - but not cause we had to fight hard for it. Its really just putting your name out there, taking a call, getting the job done. He hires out pretty much anything anyway. He doesn't do everything either, but he acts like I hardly help. He answers phone calls and texts people - which frustrates him a lot. Sometimes he has to run errands at properties. I make invoices at the end of the month and make a monthly schedule calendar - both of which he hates - and I help with communications, too. But since he works sooooo hard with the cleaning company - I am nuts for wanting him to want to get up in the morning with me and our baby, have breakfast with us, look forward to the day, have motivation, want to work on other things. He hardly does. When he does he is upset I made him get up with baby or he is in a decent mood and we spend like from 9am to noon smoking, drinking cofee, playing with baby, smoking, drinking coffee, he watches A LOT of Tiktok too during this time but really throughout the day. If he was working a normal 9-5 I assume he would go to bed at a decent hour, wake up at a decent hour, have some kind of routine, actually brush his teeth, take care of himself, etc. I really feel like he gives me bare minimum. I got pregnant and had a baby 8 months go - I lost all my baby weight a month ago. Cause I care about myself and I care about how I look for my husband. He doesn't care. He gained 50+ pounds about a year ago when I got pregnant and does not care. He isn't ugly, but everyone can tell he put on weight. My grandpa can say something to him about it- but if I do I am the worst. Oh and he started smoking again. I guess it is all my faut.. I never smoked before and on our anniversary a few months ago I asked if he wanted to get a pack and drink and stuff at our airbnb. I wanted to experience it with him. He said no bad idea that's dumb. Hours later we go and get a pack. Since then, he has kept saying we need to quit but keeps buying - even without telling me or asking me first. He said I would never have to worry about him being a smoker again - he lied. He said he will quit when HE wants to and he buys the most expensive organic brand. I begged him for years to hammock with me on the back porch - something I ENJOY. I don't ask for much. He never would. I got him a hammock to match mine. Didn't care. I asked him to do devotionals with me. Got offended because one was about sex (which I thought it was okay it was something we were struggling with so lets work on it, planning to have a baby together devotional (which we were both on board with and he said he wanted to and was excited), and then just one about new couples. He thought I was attacking him with my devotional choices. Now fast forward a few years - we don't hammock like I always asked but we can go out every thirty minutes and smoke how he wants when he wants on the front porch. We never do my devotionals or my version of bible study - but we do his which is starting from the beginning and reading a chapter or two a day from Genesis cause that is how he wants to. He said he doesn't know how to Bible study so he just wants to read it. He seems to get irritated really fast and easy too. Talks about how he can't wait for our son to get older so he can beat his ass when he is not behaving. I know he won't hurt him - but its just the words he chooses. There is honestly quite a few little things. I thought he was a hard-working, good man who really loved me and was obsessed with me - he definitely talked like it. As soon as he moved in though, he has felt different. That's been two years ago. I generally feel like he is lazy, unmotivated, doesn't care, isn't afraid to lose me, doesn't want to work hard for me (financially, emotionally, physically, or mentally), doesn't care about his health, puts in minimum effort in our relationship with God, and easily temperered. All of which I did not see before and he never hinted at being any of these things. And all of these things are BIG for me, for me personally and in a relationship. I can tell I have become sadder, more unmotivated, and more lazily since being with him. I have mentioned that to him. A few times he has a agreed, Other times he has been offended. I don't know what to do. He is open to therapy - now. But before he said ""hell no they just gonna side with you and take our money you can go by yourself I don't care"" - this was maybe 6 months to a year into our marriage. I have felt defeated for a while. There is more to this of course, this is just everything that came to mind first. I feel like either I am bad or he is - one of us has to be if I feel upset often. Maybe I shouldn't care, maybe he should be able to do whatever he wants. What he wants isn't what I want and I wouldn't have married. Not that he is always angry, unhappy, unmotivated, but I would definitely say 70% of the time. When he isn't - it is probably because I have said something recently and he doesn't want conflict. Oh he is happy when he knows we are going to the casino, too. That really took off - we started going when Iwas pregnant and he really really enjoys it even though he gets angry and rude to people and the blackjack table. I will stand for 6 hours watching him play and when we get home I am hoping for some cuddles or sex, but nope. We have fought about that, too.

tl;dr Anyway - I don't know if I am ungrateful, crazy, and nuts for the things I have come to my husband about or if he is the inconsiderate, lazy, and not emotionally reassuring man I feel like he is. And if it is one or the other or both - what do I do? I don't want to be like this forever. I can't change him and his personality, character, and drive. He did after we got married and he moved in though, So can he go back to the always happy hard-working romantic man that couldn't keep his hands off me? Or is too late from all of our fights?",3,1730300286.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False

1gfofdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gfofdn/i_need_some_real_help_right_now/,I need some real help right now.,"About 8 months ago I met this girl, we instantly clicked and things were great. We hit a few bumps starting out but we communicate efficiently and we've worked through all of it. 

She can be a handful and I know she isn't gonna be everyone's cup of tea, which is fine not everybody has to like everybody. 

She is very straightforward which can come off as rude to some people, I know this and she knows this and she wants to be let know if she does overstep any boundaries in order to correct her behavior where appropriate.

We met through a group of my friends, and the instantly showed an interest in her and me getting together. This is my first relationship in my 28 years of life.

She came along to a couple of get togethers and all seemed well, she interacted with everyone and showed genuine interest in getting to know my friends better  and while I had the feeling that there were some who she wouldn't get along with that didn't seem to be the case.

However after the first get together she confided in me that while she sat on the arm of a recliner my friend sat in, that he had been touching her inappropriately, I spoke with one of my best friends about it some time later in confidence and a few weeks after that he took it upon himself to confront the guy for me. I felt really betrayed by that move and he never properly apologised for it stating that I ""waited too long to confront him about it"". Now me and my girlfriend have talked to the guy and everything is forgiven and forgotten it was a stupid drunken mistake and will not happen again.

Fast forward to a month ago my best friend comes to me at a gathering when I am alone (not with my gf) and says how much he's missed me and we never see each other anymore. Which i understand and I tell him Ok I will let you know when I'm in town so we can meet up for a coffee or something andhis gf keeps asking where my gf is and why she isn't there saying she was looking forward to seeing her. The day after that my gf accidentally spills a drink which lands on another of my friends gf, so she went home changed pants and that was that. My gf apologised and it was a non issue... or so we thought.

Apparently the first friends gf has heard a rumor that she spilled the drink on purpose and was rude about it, and spreads that further along. At this point she stops having contact with my gf and me, stops replying to texts and denies phone calls. At the same time whenever I contact my friend that I'm in town and we should meet up √≠ get ghosted, no reply and doesn't open the msg until late during the night and no reply the day after. A few weeks of this and I contact my friend like ""hey whats up I feel like you're avoiding me and why is your gf not responding to any texts?"" The reply I get is basically that he's been super busy with his new job and that he's not avoiding me and everything is good, if anything was wrong he would talk to me about it.

He lied. 

My gf confronted his gf and basically just wanted answers for what was going on, she got a shocking non answer that she just didn't think they were clicking, and that there's been a lot of stuff that has happened that she doesn't like and doesn't want anything to do with, so she's removing herself from her life. Things get a little heated and she slips out about my gf not having a backbone because she's forcing me to contact my friends to ask about her, which is complete horseshit. I contacted my friend because he was avoiding me and we never asked anyone else to check on her. And she basically painted me in the light of someone who needed pity for having to tolerate my gf.

I was fuming. So me and my gf both blocked her which prompted my friend to text me why I blocked her stating that this is something between our gfs and that I shouldn't involve our friendship into this, which he started by avoiding me but whatever.

So a month goes by and I don't hear a single word from my friend, until I hear from a 3rd party that apparently he spoke to them about knowing how my gf is innocent in all of this drama and how I've been avoiding him. Which is not true but the ball is in his court, if he wants to send me √≠ will answer him but I've put myself on the line for too many times and get nothing back so now it's his turn.

I just found out recently after 2 months of wondering what we did wrong and why we are getting treated this way the reason behind all of this drama.

Apparently they just don't like her, they think she's rude and disrespectful. They take issues with her sitting with my friends and not me. They don't like how she ""accused"" one in the group of having groped her. They don't approve the fact that I've been spending a little extra money now that I'm in a relationship. And apparently she told one of the guys that he smelled bad (he smokes) and my other friend took that personally while the guy she said √∫t to was just like hey calm down dude. And are worried about me and how being in relationship with her will affect me. 

I understand them being worried about me getting into what they seem to think is an abusive relationship, because they care deeply about me  and I appreciate the sentiment. However you do not show concern by doing shit like this. If at any point anyone had come and just talked to me or her or both of us about these issues they could have been resolved she would not mention how someone reeks of cigarettes, and would try to tone down a bit or just wouldn't be as much around my friends. 

Now I'm at a point where I feel like everything around me is crumbling, she's having doubts about whether or not my family likes her, because none of my friends do and still acted like they did. She almost broke up with me because she felt like she was ruining my life by being herself around my friends. She wants absolutely nothing to do with any of my friends I feel like i can't trust any of them anymore because I have no idea how many of them have such a problem with her or if it's just 2 out of 4 of the closest group.

I don't know what I can do, I want to stay with my gf and start a family with her, I don't want to lose my friends over her though, and if my relationship fails because of my friends are they even my friends? Does my happiness really mean so little to them that they can't even tolerate her? 

Am I in the wrong here for feeling how I feel?

BTW I am 28, my gf is 33. My friends are aged from 25-33 as are their gfs.

I usually have a team practice on Wednesdays, but at my wife's request, I had arranged to skip it this week and notified the team so I could help my wife with some extra errands she has to do. Plus we can get a coffee and hang out and wait together for time to pick the kids up. The trouble started when she realized she forgot what time I would get home and it would be up to an hour later than she thought (I work out of two offices and Wednesdays I go to the office further from home, but closer to practice, and I can't change that.). So she realized that I wouldn't be home in time to drive the kids together. I said I could still catch up with her wherever she is and help or still hang out, and I could pick the kids up after they were done so she didn't have to. She then said I might as well go to practice since that's what I really wanted. I said that wasn't what I planned and I still wanted to help out. She asked if I had my gear in the car, which I did (because I always have my gear in the car). So now she thinks I didn't tell her I would be late getting home and took my gear so I could go to practice anyway. She says I might as well go to practice now since I won't be any help to her if I'm coming home late.

I never thought to remind her I'd be home later. If I do it sounds like I'm trying to get out of skipping practice and she usually acts like I described anyway. If I can get home and spend what time I can with her and then can put the kids to bed like I usually do, I'll take whatever time I can get. But now there probably wouldn't be much point because she won't talk to me anyway. So might as well go to practice like she said, but AITAH because now I feel like I'm doing it out of spite?",2,1730299973.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

1gfoblk,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1gfoblk/launching_another_business_tomorrow/,Launching another business tomorrow. ,"This start is way different and it does this bring back memories. 11 years ago I went from a $100k job to a cold start. I knew the trade but didn‚Äôt know nearly as much about business as I thought I did. It was a rough start. I was way under capitalized, greatly overestimated how fast it would take to gain customers, and had an employees expectation of how much profit a business makes. The first year I about wore a hole in the window in the front door pressing my forehead against it watching for business to walk in. Burned through all my savings, liquidated toys, drove cars that wouldn‚Äôt get towed if I left them parked in a no parking spot. It was a hard start that lasted for years. One day I was 17 minutes from losing my house. If the customer coming to pay for a large job would have stopped for coffee I would have had to move into the back of the business. 
One thing that didn‚Äôt change was start up expectations. The model changed a few times and tech costs were way higher than expected. The hope was to build out in 2-3 months for $3/4000, it went to years and about $50k with a lot of sweat equity on top of a 60 hour a week time budget for the other business.
One thing that‚Äôs better is I have no dependency on the finances. The space and utilities for the new business are 100% subsidized by my existing business, same location. I have plenty of personal savings to cover its day to day expenses, and they are pretty minimal. The expense to revenue ratio is way way lower the other business. It‚Äôs unattended, no employees, an app does everything but mop the floors and takes out the trash. I don‚Äôt need it to get profitable fast because the other business is doing great. But it is a completely new business model of a service that is really popular, with the plan being to provide that service at a considerably higher quality. After 11 years of customers, I will never have a business that doesn‚Äôt cater to the premium tier of a market. It will be nice if I don‚Äôt lose the $40k and 2 years, but I have lost way more money and time on other activities that had no chance of return.

I have been brewing with my glass v60 for several years now, and the only beans that I cannot consistently dial in are Colombian Huila. I have had beans from three different farms, mostly Caturra and Bourbon, and they always come out overly acidic for my taste.

I'm neurodivergent, depressed and have anxiety disorder (taking meds for this). I have a pretty good paying (but dead-endish) job, have my interests and hobbies. Love reading, music and other things. All my life I felt permeating loneliness and a feeling of difference from people both my age, older and younger... I can hold a conversation, but other people baffle me with things they actually care about. Especially younger people, who seem not even interested in talking to eachother, let alone me (in work etc). 

Being neurodivergent, but not diagnosed what exactly I ""have"", my Interests are pretty weird I admit, I play bass, guitar, some piano, can sing pretty good, love weird and old music, but can listen and appreciate normie music too. I love reading, making some kick ass coffee (v60, flair espresso etc), have very good manual skills (I'm currently building a 3d printer of my own design from scratch, have built a bass guitar only using hand tools, can do home renovations etc, actually can do amazing massages too, since that's one of my Interests and I have read a few books/practiced a lot). I exercise - calisthenics and free weights, eat well (when I eat... Since my appetite fluctuates with depression episodes), take care of myself, have a pretty good body imo (and my exes opinion too :p) except for my face... Which I feel is unattractive, as in not in the canon of beauty (big nose, no too prominent jaw and cheekbones) 

I had one serious partner. It was a love which was coming from both of us, she loved me and I loved her. The chemistry was amazing, sex was simply indescribably good. It was perfect. She was the most beautiful woman I have ever laid my eyes upon..Welp... Turned out she was married. We were ""together"" for six years. She also was suffering from depression, and She had laid off her meds, proclaimed that She wants to be pregna t with her husband. I was speechless. Maybe I'm dumb, but I still love her, despite this, and I doubt I can ever forget her embrace. She wanted to keep being together somehow, but for the good of her child I backed out. I want her to be happy, her child and husband to be happy too. For them to be complete... I took the hit on me completely it seems since when I check her FB page she seems to be happy. Since the break my depression evolved into actual wishing to die and self harm, poisoning myself, hating myself... I tried to take my life on multiple occasions. My mother took me to therapy, but after four different attempts with different specialists, no help could be found.

I actually feel like my death is imminent. My heart physically hurts, but I wont resist if I get a heart attack. During one of my attempts I took 2k mg dph and all of my antidepresants (hundreds od pills of duloxetine) but I'm still there somehow. 

Now I feel that all I do is wake up, go to work and try to talk with some people I think are as weird as I am, then go to sleep after work. Life is pretty much meaningless. I have a Tinder account with no matches (yes, I am dumb enough to actually pay for premium, boosts, superlikes etc) despite actually having pretty good photos considering my looks and having a good bio there, being nice and sincere with others... I don't understand it. My iq is 139 and my diagnosis is simple - I'm ugly. Personality, your status, heck even cock size dont matter at all when you are ugly. That's all she wrote and we can deceive ourselves if so we choose. So... Yeah I'm pretty sure that's what is on my mind right now.

Actually, I was texting a girl I know,,we had good chemistry and all but got ghosted. Wtf is with peoples manners nowadays? I thought everything was good, but I was mistaken once again.

All I wish for right now is love, you know? I don't even mean sex, despite really liking making love and allegedly being really good at it (which I suspect was the reason Alice was with me, a weirdo, for so long?) but right now all I want is to love and be loved in return, like souls love eachother, care for eachother... Try to keep each other warm during this storm called life... But I feel like that's just past me. I'm done with it, but not from my choice. People call men like me ""incels"" I learn... I don't have anything in common with those men, but I do understand their loneliness, feelings of being an alien. In a way, I get the anger too, but I am not angry at women, I actually really care and am courteous even when I'm rejected. But... I just don't know what to say... Why even say anything. Don't you understand? I bet you do, since you are here. I want to talk with someone, I want to build a future for my wife, my kids. I cant do it goddammit :( I actually watch porn to see women smile and stuff since I can't make anyone smile in this way... It's really pathetic and I want to die thinking about that.

Yes... All that wall of text was written while crying, after work and laying in bath. I'm gonna clean myself up and get to bed I think, but if you wanna talk... Please talk to me (quoting Joni Mitchell)",2,1730299256.0,loneliness,1,1.0,False

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

¬†

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn‚Äôt say anything.

¬†

I needed a job‚Äîsomething to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a caf√© just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

¬†

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

¬†

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the caf√©: Love & Coffee.

¬†

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The caf√©‚Äôs simple elegance, with its white and brown d√©cor, felt inviting.

¬†

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù I stammered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?‚Äù

¬†

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

¬†

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre looking for a job?‚Äù His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

¬†

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. ‚ÄúI really need one. I don‚Äôt have much experience, but I‚Äôm a fast learner and willing to do anything.‚Äù

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. ‚ÄúRelax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.‚Äù

[https://www.reddit.com/r/naltrexone/comments/1g70gg4/4\_days\_in\_with\_naltrexone/](https://www.reddit.com/r/naltrexone/comments/1g70gg4/4_days_in_with_naltrexone/)

TLDR at the bottom.

This is not for any upvotes.¬† I know people are researching this drug or wondering if others are having the same experiences as them.¬† This is my experience and hopefully it‚Äôs helpful to you.¬† Most everything I put here is something ABNORMAL FOR ME and \**could\** be attributed to a side effect of Naltrexone.

Day 5:

Sleep was rough last night.¬† I get pretty bad insomnia after I don't drink for a few days, so this is expected.¬† I took the first full pill this morning.¬† I was in a shit mood but as I sat with the family at the hotel breakfast, I could feel myself just calm down.¬† Is it the drug or the 2 cups of coffee I slammed? I don't know but I'll take it.¬† Had some fruit too.¬† Still have that nausea and headache with the pill though.

Around lunch we went to a poutine shop.¬† My anxiety level after taking a full pill is just like a few days ago when I took my very first dose.¬† So a bit of a roller coaster here but it‚Äôs manageable.¬†

Please NOTE on this anxiety feeling:

I've noticed the anxiety produced with Nal feels very ""manufactured"". ¬† Meaning the PHYSICAL aspects of an attack are there (rapid breathing, racing heart, tightness in the chest, some tingling in the face and fingers) but none of the emotions and thoughts are there.¬† No feeling of impending doom, loss of control, bewilderment, you don't know what to do... and the thoughts are not there.¬† No thinking I'm having a heart attack, feeling ashamed, wondering if¬† people can tell I'm flipping out inside my head, wondering if it looks like I'm going to cry.¬† So I just ride it out and it's not too bothersome.¬† It‚Äôs just odd.

Anyway, we go for poutine.¬† The nausea had not really bothered me before, so I ordered the shredded chicken with extra ghost pepper sauce.¬† After the first bite, I was like, ew, I don't want this.¬† But sometimes I feel like that anyway so I just plowed into it.¬† I got about halfway through and knew, this ain't gonna stay with me.¬† But we were with the kids and grandkids so I chilled out and breathed.¬† We had to stop at a grocery store so I slipped out back and started puking.¬† Yes....Ghost pepper sauce....¬† Went back around front and played it cool.¬† Went back to the hotel and we had the grandkids.¬† I looked at my wife and told her to get them somewhere because no one wanted to hear what was about to happen.

I hard core ugly-gag-barfed everything.¬† And yes, ghost pepper sauce.... Whew.¬† That kinda sucked.¬† Ok I feel better.¬† We went to the planned family gathering that night and I listened to my body this time.¬† I had a couple bites of food and felt the need to stop, so I did.¬† But I still felt kinda gross.¬† I know I'll catch slack for this, but I took a single puff of weed (it was a big puff)¬† to even myself out.¬† After having 30 minutes of an actual anxiety attack (do I look high? Do they know if I‚Äôm super high? Do I sound stupid?¬† Do I look stupid? Stop talking, you‚Äôre too high.) it did even me out and I felt pretty good.¬† Weed has never been a vice of mine.¬† I'll take 1 or 2 puffs socially once a year, if that.¬† So, yes I'm not sober, but I'm not drinking which is the goal here.

Something new here too.¬† I couldn't swallow.¬† I don't know if my mouth was just too dry, but for a moment I just could not swallow.¬† I got some water and had to really force myself to swallow it.¬† Lasted about 10 minutes.¬† Low grade headache has been here for a couple days.¬† Taking advil.

Day 6:

Took the full dose first thing at 7 AM.¬† Went to the hotel breakfast buffet and could only manage 2 pieces of toast.¬† Due to my health/alcohol related ailments, I also need to lose weight.¬† That's fine, I'll take the help.¬† Am I annoyed I don't get to try and make the hotel lose money on me and the buffet?¬† Hell yes!¬† But my life and my liver need me to stop drinking.¬† There was no ""fake"" anxiety attack today.¬† But I cannot eat more than 3 bites of food without feeling sick.¬† The euphoric feeling comes and goes.¬† After driving home all day from our family function I feel a bit worn out from being tired>euphoric>a little depressed>tired>euphoric....¬† I'm hungry but have no appetite.¬† I want to eat, but when I actually think about eating something, it grosses me out.

But when drinking liquids, I had an issue swallowing again.¬† Had to really force myself to get it down.¬† The low grade headache persists.

We always go to the bar after the long drive back from the family.¬† I can feel my body and mind just wanting to give into the habit. The thought of actually going to the bar turned my stomach.¬† It‚Äôs force of habit.¬† But it just felt gross....I didn't want to do it.¬† The meds must be working.¬† Please note: THIS IS HUGE FOR ME!¬† After that drive and all weekend facing my social anxiety with many family members, I MUST DRINK.¬† And I didn't.¬† This was THE TEST I was waiting for and passed with flying colors in my mind.¬† This is good.

Day 7:

Pill first thing at 8AM.¬† Shower then coffee.¬† Very, very little nausea.¬† Had toast and jam and felt pretty good.¬† After a couple hours that euphoria/sluggish/tired/focused feeling hit.¬† I hate to say it, but this euphoric feeling I get really seems like a very low dose of MDMA.¬† Everything is super cool and it's all gonna work out for me.¬† I'll take it! I‚Äôm able to work without any issues.¬† This afternoon I became very hungry.¬† I ate more than I have been in the last couple days.¬† Almost no nausea so this is good.¬† Ate a bit more and all was good.

After thinking about it, I am a bit sluggish the second half of the day.¬† The past couple days have felt like that.¬† It must not be that bad because in the moment I just pushed through it.¬† Still have that headache. Taking advil for that helps.

The swallowing thing seems to be subsiding.¬† But I still have to think about the action to really get it moving.¬† It‚Äôs not an all day thing, but it‚Äôs there on occasion.¬†

Day 8:

I've noticed the past couple of days my sleep and dreams have been very disorienting.¬† The dreams are very vivid and I wake up and actually don't know where I am for about 3-5 seconds.¬† This is very uncommon for me. Took the pill first thing as usual.¬† No nausea.¬† Ate oatmeal and coffee as usual.¬† No side effects yet.¬† My hunger and appetite grew throughout the day.¬† I started eating as I normally would.¬† But once satiated I was very uncomfortable.¬† Different than I usually am if I over eat.¬† It was weird.¬† We'll assume it's the Nal or maybe the fact I've under eaten for a few days now.¬† Still the low grade headache...but not as bad.

Day 9:

Terrible insomnia last night.¬† But not drinking always does that to me.¬† So could be either Nal or no alcohol.¬† The thoughts of getting drunk are easily pushed out of my mind so I'm feeling pretty good about this.¬† Still feeling overstuffed from yesterday so just toast and jam for breakfast.¬† Emotion and physical feelings are all level.¬† Off to work!¬† I cut back on my dinner portion.¬† I still felt strangely over stuffed. I'll have to cut back tomorrow some more.¬† I'm strangely energetic in the evenings now.¬† Probably due to the lack of drinking.¬† I'm overly tired in the mornings because my sleep seems very restless.¬† I should get back to the gym and see if that helps.¬† I'll try tomorrow.

Day 10:

slept a little better.¬† set the alarm early for the gym but didn't get up or go.¬† Took my pill and didn‚Äôt eat breakfast.¬† just not hungry.¬† Thought about eating and it actually kinda grossed me out.¬† The grogginess seems to be going away but not very fast.¬† There were intrusive thoughts about drinking last night but I was able to stifle them pretty easily.¬† It was after dinner and really I just could not stomach the thought of eating or drinking anything else.¬† Later in the day the groggy feeling kicked in for a bit.¬† That headache popped up too.¬† But it‚Äôs not horrible. Ate less for dinner but still felt over stuffed.¬† Will have to keep toning that down.

Day 11:

Got up and took the pill first thing.¬† Waking up I‚Äôm still disoriented.¬† I‚Äôve been skipping breakfast.¬† I think the Nal is just making me have no appetite.¬† We‚Äôre going out tonight.¬† Wonder if I‚Äôll drink‚Ä¶ As I‚Äôm leading up to tonight, I‚Äôm feeling a very strong urge to drink.¬† It‚Äôs not going away.¬† I feel a bit light headed with this feeling that something inside me is fighting itself.¬† I feel that same old urge to drink, and that familiar feeling that the decision is already made inside my head.¬† I‚Äôm not going to worry about it.¬† I‚Äôll talk to my doctor next week about this.¬† So we did go for a drink.¬† After the first shot or two, I usually have that warm fuzzy inside‚Ä¶that feeling of ‚Äúoh yeah, that‚Äôs what I wanted.‚Äù¬† It wasn‚Äôt there.¬† In fact, the whole situation felt kinda gross.¬† I drank purely from force of habit.¬† My wife noted I drank less than half of what I usually do.¬† I noted that as well because for once, I wasn‚Äôt blackout drunk by the end of the night.¬† Baby steps I supposed.¬† It did make me sick though.¬† I have not puked from booze in I don‚Äôt know how long.

Day 12:

The hang over today is unreal.¬† I slammed a bunch of water and sugar free coolaid.¬† I forgot to take my pill.¬† Basically hung around the house and paid for last night.  My appetite has come back though.

Day 13:

Took my pill first thing.¬† No more headache and no more nausea.¬† Usually on a Sunday night if I‚Äôm feeling ok, we‚Äôll go out again.¬† I had no urge to do that.¬† I think this is working. Still a good appetite but I get full very easily now.  I have to be careful not to over eat.

Day 14:

Took my pill this morning.¬† I had some personal issues come up.¬† That‚Äôs usually something that will trigger a ‚Äúgo out tonight and get drunk‚Äù response, but I was easily able to fend it off.

Doc visit:

She is happy I have backed off from 3 blackout nights a week to none and just one drinking episode.¬† I guess that‚Äôs an extreme amount of progress compared to others.¬† I am determined to stop drinking though so I‚Äôve tried to be vigilant with this med and my feelings throughout this experience.

I‚Äôll stay on this med and I‚Äôm excited for what the future holds.¬† It will take some time to get my brain rewired, but this experience has shown me I can do this.¬†¬†

TLDR:

Over the course of 2 weeks, I started out with some pretty bad nausea that has completely subsided.¬† I also had a low grade headache that has also completely subsided.¬† I felt some strange form of anxiety that physically manifested itself, but mentally and emotionally, it didn‚Äôt seem to bother me.¬† It was very odd.¬† I have been able to curb my drinking at about a 75% reduction with a goal of complete abstinence.¬† My doctor said that kind of reduction is huge and not something she normally sees so quickly.¬† But I am determined.¬† I will stay on the drug.¬† The only side effect I seem to have now is some light grogginess for a couple hours in the day.

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the caf√© began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn‚Äôt even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration‚Äîone I hadn‚Äôt heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

‚ÄúDrea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought‚Äî""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn‚Äôt want to drag you into my mess.‚Äù

‚ÄúMessed up?‚Äù I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I‚Äôm so sorry, Drea. I promise, I‚Äôm not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren‚Äôt alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. ‚ÄúOh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids‚ÄîIsla and Josh.‚Äù

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? ‚ÄúOh... hi,‚Äù I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Isla‚Äôs third birthday today,‚Äù Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

‚ÄúHappy Birthday, Isla,‚Äù I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla‚Äôs face lit up. ‚ÄúThank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!‚Äù

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. ‚ÄúYes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.‚Äù

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch up with you later, Adrian,‚Äù I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian‚Äôs family lingering for Isla‚Äôs birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the caf√© and mentally kicked myself. I‚Äôd forgotten to get Adrian‚Äôs number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn‚Äôt managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

‚ÄúDrea,‚Äù a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. ‚ÄúI was just coming to see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAdrian?‚Äù I blinked, surprised. ‚ÄúI thought you left hours ago.‚Äù

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. ‚ÄúI did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.‚Äù

I nodded, my heart pounding. ‚ÄúYeah, we do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to take a walk?‚Äù

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn‚Äôt want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶‚Äù Adrian‚Äôs voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. ‚ÄúYou got married.‚Äù

I shot him a sideways glance. ‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? It was all over the news. Didn‚Äôt you see it?‚Äù

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù

He laughed softly, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You‚Äôve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.‚Äù

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn‚Äôt lie to him. Not after everything we‚Äôd been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real, Adrian.‚Äù

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a business deal,‚Äù I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. ‚ÄúMy parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.‚Äù

Adrian‚Äôs expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. ‚ÄúDrea‚Ä¶‚Äù

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, Adrian. I am. I‚Äôve learned to deal with it.‚Äù

His jaw clenched. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn‚Äôt have let this happen.‚Äù

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault. You couldn‚Äôt have known.‚Äù

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn‚Äôt work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing out here?‚Äù

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed‚Äîthough I couldn‚Äôt quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just come inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe door‚Ä¶ it wouldn‚Äôt open,‚Äù I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. ‚ÄúDid you try using your fingerprint?‚Äù

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. ‚ÄúUnbelievable. Now we‚Äôre locked out.‚Äù He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn‚Äôt help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he‚Äôd let me in‚Äîboth literally and figuratively.

Reman engine 2k miles since install

Symptoms: engine turns off ""randomly "". how ever as soon as it dies, it comes alive again. As if a toddler is flipping a light switch on the ignition circuit.

Day to day : 
- warm up cycle, complety dies in the first 5 min. Restarts with no issues. Sometimes I will die twice.
- first 5-10 miles, while driving around the neighborhood occasionally will completely stall out, other times is stumbling like it hasn't had enough coffee.
-on the highway, like clock work, about every 5 min. Be holding 60mph, then the engine dies but instantly recovers. No codes, battery light and dinger come on momentarily. 

Although it is a 'new' engine, already has the ticks.
 I suspected the fuel pump driver and tested that by bypassing it, forcing the fuel pump on full time. Didn't change anything. Haven't changed the fuel filter yet.
Could be the vct selenoids, but those are new as well. And the problem seems to continue with them disconnected ( I can confirm that if need be)

I'm just stepping into espresso but I have been reading and youtubing my cheeks off to get some decent shots.

I use an IMS 15g basket, did the coin test to get close to 16g in there with a darker roast. I use a lelit mara x v2, set the OPV to about 9,5 bars to get about 9 bars in the group head. I use third wave water espresso water, my pucks always look pretty good with a puck screen on top that fits well but I still can't dial in my - allegedly aligned - SSP MP burrs to a point where it makes sense, I kinda always get a 20-25s shot at a setting of 12-15, if I go finer than that I get a shot that stalls for a bit and then kinda gushes out and channels. I grind 16g into the dosing cup without slowfeeding with 2 spritzes of RDT at a grind setting of 13, I leave the fines in there, not using the bellows, put it into my dry and prewarmed portafilter, WDT thouroughly and evenly from bottom to top, give it one firm tap on the tampermatte, tamp into it with the base ripple, level tamper from normcore twice without pushing ultra hard, put the puck screen in, gently insert into the machine and immediately pull the shot from a previously dry shower screen as it hits about 92 celsius brew temp. I am suspecting that the burrs just aren't seasoned enough even after 2kg of seasoning beans. As you can see, the burrs should be aligned well, but in the pour over on pourover setting of about 55, there's still this really unpleasant amount of mud ontop of the coffee bed in the filter (plus an eternity of time running through).

So my question is: is there such a thing as over alignment? Am I making some other mistake I'm not seeing? How was your experience seasoning and dialing in with the 64mm ssp multipurpose burrs (on the df64 gen2)?

It's kinda frustrating because the shot always looks like it's channeling put the pucks come out looking unsuspicious. The shot comes out either sour or bitter, sometimes both, the paddle upgrade helps with getting in some bitterness that I prefer over the sour, but it never comes out sweet, which is a shame. 5s prefinfusion makes it bitter. tapering off the flow at the end helps better but I end up in bitter and unpleasant territory, grind size seems impossible to adjust. If I go hotter, it gets bitter. Please help.
