The drive to Denny's gave me time to think, maybe too much time. Every scenario my mind conjured was worse than the last. Drug smuggling. Organ harvesting. Human trafficking. None of them quite fit what I suspected I saw, or at least thought I saw. Based on the hints and unnerving glimpses I really did not know anything for sure about what was really going on at PT. Shipping, yet anything seemed plausible.

Jean was already there when I arrived, tucked into a booth in the far corner, nursing a cup of coffee. She'd changed out of her work clothes into jeans and a faded sweatshirt, but the severe bun remained, pulling her features taut.

""You came,"" she said as I slid into the seat across from her. ""Wasn't sure you would.""

""Of course, what was it you wanted to tell me? I was sort of hoping that it might be a bit more about what the hell we are moving in that place."" I replied, keeping my voice low despite the nearly empty restaurant. ""What I heard last night, what I saw‚Ä¶""

""You didn't see anything,"" Jean interrupted, her eyes hard. ""That's the first thing you need to understand. If you're going to survive this job, you need to accept that some things cannot be explained. Or rather, should not be explained.""

A waitress approached, but Jean waved her away with a practiced gesture. The woman retreated without a word, as if she recognized something in Jean that warned against interruption.

""I can't just pretend I didn't hear anything. I mean come on, are we even safe?"" I asked, leaning forward. ""Something is wrong with those containers. Something was buzzing, maybe even scratching inside them. Then there were the screams during that so-called maintenance period.""

Jean's hand shot across the table, gripping my wrist with painful intensity. Her fingernails dug into my skin as she pulled me closer.

""Lower your voice,"" she hissed. Her eyes, I noticed for the first time, weren't just tired, they held a kind of haunted knowledge that made me falter.

""Yes, there were sounds. Yes, there were things in those containers that probably don't fit into your neat little understanding of the world. But knowing more won't help you. It will only make things worse. And no, strictly speaking we are not what you would probably call safe. But the only way to guarantee you are not safe, is to keep openly asking questions.""

She released my wrist, leaving small crescent marks where her nails had been. I rubbed the spot, watching as she took another sip of her coffee, her hands trembling slightly.

""I can't keep working there,"" I said finally. ""Whatever's happening, it's messed up. At this point the whole thing seems like it is a front for something massively illegal. I don‚Äôt know how much you aren‚Äôt telling me, but maybe we could go to the police. With everything we suspect, someone would have to investigate.""

A harsh, bitter laugh escaped Jean's lips, drawing glances from the few other early morning patrons. She leaned back in the booth, suddenly looking almost defeated.

""You have no idea what you're dealing with,"" she said, her voice dropping to a whisper. ""The police? They already know. Or at least, certain people in the department do. Why do you think we operate so openly? Why do we have business licenses and tax ID numbers? This isn't some fly-by-night operation, PT has connections.""

""What kind of connections could possibly allow them to‚Ä¶""

""Powerful ones,"" Jean cut me off. ""Look, I've seen people like you before. Decent, moral people who think they can change things. Who think they can expose what's happening and make it stop."" She leaned forward again, her eyes locking with mine. ""Remember Jacob? The guy who had your job before you?"" I shook my head.

""Exactly. No one remembers Jacob. He decided to be a hero too. Took photos on his phone of one of the containers. Tried to open one when no one was looking."" Her voice caught slightly. ""Two days later, his apartment was empty. All his things were gone. Like he never existed. His mother filed a missing persons report. Nothing came of it.""

A cold weight settled in my stomach. ""You're saying they killed him?""

Jean's eyes darted around the restaurant before returning to mine. ""I'm saying he disappeared. Just like Marissa before him, and David before her. People who ask too many questions don't last long at PT.""

I swallowed hard and considered her words. It was too much at that point and I just resolved to get out. I told Jean my plan,

‚ÄúOkay then, I will just quit. I don‚Äôt like it, but if something dangerous or illegal is going on that could just disappear me, then I will just leave. I can even put in a two weeks notice, so they don‚Äôt think it is because I suspect something.""

Jean laughed, a harsh and hollow sound. She looked at me like I was an unruly child.

‚ÄúYou think that they believe anyone could be so dense as to not suspect something? Even after one night?‚Äù

""So then what can I do? Why are you telling me this?‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed and she responded,

‚ÄúBecause you need to know, that you can‚Äôt just quit now. You are in this, whether you like it or not. If you want to not disappear too, then just keep your head down, keep quiet and do not rock the boat, the less you know the less danger you are in. I have to go, you should get some sleep and remember what I told you. I am off tomorrow, try and keep safe while I‚Äôm gone, and take care.‚Äù

She threw some money on the table and walked out without another word and I was left stunned and speechless. It sounded like I was stuck and I still had no idea what I had gotten myself into?



My anxiety was palpable and I hardly got any sleep when I returned home. If what Jean said was true, then the place I had just gotten a job at, was hiding a dark secret and I could not uncover it or leave and run away. I was forced for the time being, to continue working for the bizarre company. Continue shifting those mysterious boxes without ever knowing what horrors they might contain.

When it was time to go back, I hesitated and almost considered calling out and not going. But I did not want to attract any unwanted attention just then so I summoned my courage and went back to PT. Shipping for my second day of work.

I arrived a few minutes early, but no one else was there to greet me this time. I shuffled in and grabbed a new manifest from my work station and the tablet. I saw the first shipment was scheduled to arrive in the next ten minutes. Then I looked at the list continue on into another page and realized that there were twice the amount of trucks that day than my first and I had no apparent help, at least with what I would be doing. I thought briefly about the other people I saw leave the building yesterday at 5:00am. Why did they have us sectioned off and not working together? It was another question I would have to set aside. I was going to be very busy and thought that maybe the distraction might be nice.

The first truck backed up to the loading dock with a low rumble that vibrated through the concrete floor. I approached cautiously, remembering Jean's methodical movements from the night before. The keypad by the door blinked expectantly. I punched in the code I'd memorized and stepped back as the doors swung open.

Unlike last night's mysterious black containers, this truck held rows of ordinary-looking wooden crates. They were stacked neatly, secured with straps, each bearing standard shipping labels and barcodes. No strange temperatures. No odd buzzing. Just regular freight. I let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding. Maybe not every shipment contained whatever horrors Jean had alluded to. Maybe some days were just‚Ä¶normal.

The manifest indicated these were ""textile supplies"" for various retail locations across three states. Fabric bolts, perhaps. Sewing machines. Things a company called ""The Proud Tailor"" might legitimately ship.

I worked efficiently, scanning each crate and moving it to its designated staging area. The forklift hummed beneath me, comfortingly mundane. For nearly an hour, I allowed myself to believe I was simply working a regular warehouse job, one that happened to pay extraordinarily well for night shifts. I thought I might be able to relax for a moment, but I heard the staticy voice of Matt through the intercom,

‚ÄúNew guy, second shipment is ahead of schedule. It is a priority shipment. Get down to receiving bay B. Get a move on.‚Äù I was not even done with the first load and now the next one was already coming. I was starting to get stressed out that I was falling behind.

I rushed to bay B, maneuvering the forklift hastily through the narrow aisles. As I rounded the final corner, I caught sight of the back of a sleek black truck, similar to the first one I'd seen last night. My heart immediately began to race, knowing what might be inside.

Just as I approached the loading dock, the forklift sputtered, the engine making a high-pitched whining sound I hadn't heard before. The control panel flickered, lights blinking erratically across the dashboard. I tried to slow down, but the machine lurched forward suddenly, as if pushed by an invisible hand. I yanked the steering wheel to the right, narrowly avoiding a stack of pallets.

The forklift shuddered violently beneath me, the hydraulics screaming in protest. Then, without warning, the lift dropped, not smoothly as designed, but in a single catastrophic release. They slammed into the concrete floor with a deafening crash, sparks flying as metal scraped against concrete.

I was thrown forward against the safety cage, my chest hitting the steering column hard enough to knock the wind from my lungs. The forklift continued its chaotic movement, spinning in a half-circle before the engine cut out completely, leaving me stranded in the middle of the bay.

""What the hell are you doing?"" Matt's voice boomed from somewhere behind me. I turned to see him storming across the warehouse floor, his face contorted with rage.

""I didn't, the forklift just‚Ä¶"" I stammered, still trying to catch my breath.

Matt reached me in seconds, his weathered face inches from mine. ""Get off. Now.""

I scrambled down from the malfunctioning vehicle, my legs shaking. Matt circled the forklift, examining it with narrowed eyes. He ran his hand along the control panel, then knelt to inspect the dropped forks.

""This equipment was checked yesterday,"" he muttered, more to himself than to me. Then his gaze snapped back to my face, eyes cold and calculating. ""God damn interference is worse than normal. Were you near any red-tagged containers earlier?""

""No,"" I answered truthfully. ""I've been unloading the one marked textile shipment so far.""

Matt's jaw tightened as he glanced toward the black truck waiting at the bay. ""Well the timing of this is awful.""

He pulled a radio from his belt. ""Jean, we need you at bay B. Equipment failure."" There was no response, just static. ""Right,"" he sighed. ""She's off today.""

The back doors of the black truck swung open on their own, revealing the now-familiar darkness that seemed deeper than it should be. A soft, rhythmic thumping sound emerged from within, like something repeatedly striking the interior wall.

Matt cursed under his breath. ""Those need to be moved immediately. Temperature-sensitive."" He turned to me. ""You'll have to move them manually.""

""Manually?"" I echoed, my voice cracking. ""You mean carry them?""

""The dollies are in the maintenance closet,"" Matt growled, pointing toward a narrow door across the warehouse. ""Grab one. Quick.""

I jogged to the closet, my mind racing. Manual handling meant direct contact with whatever those black containers held. The thought made my skin crawl, but I had little choice. Matt was watching my every move with increasing impatience. Inside the closet, I found several heavy-duty dollies designed for oversized freight. I selected the sturdiest-looking one and wheeled it back to the bay where Matt stood, arms crossed, foot tapping rhythmically against the concrete.

""Remember the protocol,"" he said as I approached the truck. ""No unnecessary contact. Move them directly to the designated area."" He glanced at his watch. ""I need to make a call. Get this done before I return.""

As Matt disappeared through a side door, I faced the yawning darkness of the truck's interior alone. The thumping had stopped, replaced by an eerie silence that somehow felt worse. I steeled myself and rolled the dolly up the loading ramp.

The first container slid forward as if pushed by unseen hands, just like the night before. Up close, without Jean's calming presence, the experience was infinitely more unsettling. The black surface seemed to absorb the light around it, and as I positioned the dolly beneath one end, I could have sworn the container shifted slightly, adjusting on its own to maintain balance.

I carefully tipped the container back, distributing its considerable weight across the dolly's frame. It was heavier than I expected, at least three hundred pounds. As I began to pull it down the ramp, a vibration traveled up through the handles into my arms, a subtle, rhythmic tremor like a heartbeat.

The container slid off the truck with surprising ease, almost eager to be free of its confined space. I guided it across the warehouse floor toward the staging area Matt had indicated. With each step, the vibration grew more pronounced.

When I reached the staging area, I carefully lowered the container to the ground. As it settled onto the concrete, a sound emerged from within, a kind of soft scraping, like fingernails dragging across the interior surface. I jumped back, nearly losing my grip on the dolly.

The digital display on the container flickered, the temperature reading jumping from -10¬∞C to -8¬∞C, then back again. The scraping sound intensified for a moment, then abruptly stopped.

I stood frozen, staring at the black box. Whatever was sounded like it was moving, scraping. The realization sent ice through my veins, but I couldn't afford to panic. There were still two more containers to move, and Matt would return soon.

Forcing myself back to the truck, I repeated the process with the second container. This one was even heavier, and as I maneuvered it down the ramp, a thin sheen of condensation formed on its surface, immediately turning to frost in the warehouse air. The temperature display read -15¬∞C, colder than the first.

As I positioned it next to the other container, both boxes seemed to shudder simultaneously, as if acknowledging each other's presence. The hair on my arms stood on end, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, not by security cameras or by Matt, but by whatever was sealed inside these mysterious shipments.

I returned for the third and final container, my nerves fraying with each step. This one looked different from the others, slightly larger, with a faint red glow emanating from its temperature display. As I approached, a wave of dizziness washed over me, accompanied by a high-pitched ringing in my ears.

The container slid forward, but unlike the others, it moved aggressively, nearly crushing me against the side of the truck. I stumbled backward, barely catching myself on the loading dock edge.

""Careful,"" Matt said as he walked up behind me. He looked over my shoulder and saw the red glint of the item.

‚ÄúNot sure why this one was not red tagged on the list. Step out please, I am taking this to the secure storage room. I need you to move all the other boxes to cold storage and hurry. I don‚Äôt have anyone else to spare for help at the moment, so just go as fast as you can.‚Äù

I nodded quickly and stepped aside, watching as Matt carefully maneuvered the red-labeled container onto a specialized cart. His movements were precise, almost reverent, as he secured it with straps I hadn't seen used on any other shipment. The container emitted a soft humming noise that made my teeth ache.

""Don't fall behind,"" Matt called over his shoulder as he wheeled the mysterious box away. ""And remember, no unnecessary contact.""

I returned to my task, moving the remaining containers to cold storage with mechanical efficiency. Each one seemed to react differently to being handled, one vibrated intensely when passing certain areas of the warehouse, another grew noticeably heavier near the loading bay doors, as if reluctant to be stored away. I tried to focus solely on the physical labor, to shut down the part of my brain screaming that none of this was normal.

The cold storage area was a maze of shelving units filled with identical black containers. The temperature was brutal, my breath clouding instantly in the frigid air. My fingers grew numb as I positioned each new arrival in its designated spot, guided only by the blinking scanner in my hand. I noticed that some of the older containers had frost patterns forming on their surfaces, not random crystallization, but intricate, almost deliberate designs.

Just as I finished securing the last container, the lights in cold storage flickered. Once, twice, then plunged into darkness for a full three seconds before sputtering back to life. I stood there shivering and regretted not bringing a coat or something warm. Fortunately, I was finished.

Back on the main floor, I discovered that two more trucks had arrived while I'd been occupied in the cold storage area. My heart sank at the sight of the endless freight waiting to be processed. Without the forklift, I'd have to move everything by hand. Matt was nowhere to be found, likely still dealing with that mysterious red-tagged container.

I grabbed another dolly and set to work, my muscles already protesting from the strain of moving the first batch of containers. These new shipments weren't the black boxes but were still unnervingly heavy,crates of ""textile equipment"" according to their manifests, though they weighed far more than any sewing machine I'd ever encountered. 

I tried to maintain a rhythm as I wheeled crate after crate to their designated areas. The warehouse seemed to stretch endlessly before me, distances expanding impossibly between loading dock and staging areas. My shirt clung to my back with sweat despite the building's chill.

After I finished with the trucks, another arrived with dozens of smaller packages needing scanning and sorting. Fatigue made me clumsy, and I fumbled with the scanner, dropping it twice and cracking the casing on the second fall.

The clock on the wall read 2:17 AM. I'd been working non-stop for hours, yet had barely made a dent in the night's shipments. The manifest on my tablet showed three more trucks scheduled before dawn

I felt a spike of panic rise in my chest. There was simply no way I could finish all this alone.

I worked non-stop, skipping whatever time I would have taken for a break. I was tired hungry and exhausted and no one else was around to help. I lost track of time and to my horror I heard the 5am alarm go off. I dropped a box I was carrying and it crashed to the floor. I was scared to look down at it, but when I did I saw the box had not opened.

I bolted to the exit just in time, feeling the adrenaline surging through my veins as I burst out, immediately catching the anxious stares of a few coworkers from other sections of the warehouse. Their eyes were wide with concern, clearly worried about the chaos erupting behind me. As I hurried further away, I desperately tried to block out the ominous noises that began to echo, a sinister sound building in the distance. Suddenly, a whisper sliced through the tension, urgently vying for my attention.

""Hey, you! Did you see Mike? From Section 4? He was supposed to be right behind me."" I shook my head, and watched as the blood drained from the man's face.

I was about to offer some reassurance when the air was pierced by an intensifying buzzing and screeching sound, a cacophony that made my skin crawl. The others turned away, unwilling to face the impending horror, but the man who had questioned me stood frozen, fear etched on his features. The terrifying sounds from yesterday crescendoed once more, each note now carrying the unmistakable clarity of a person‚Äôs voice, a desperate cry for help. A scream tore through the air, sharp and chilling, and then everything plunged into an eerie, suffocating silence.

I turned away, closing my eyes, and tried to steady my thoughts as I waited. Eventually, someone announced we had just one minute before maintenance time ended. We lined up to return to our stations, and I caught sight of the man who had asked about his co-worker, shuffling despondently behind me. His face was a mask of hopelessness and despair. We all had a sense that something terrible had happened to his friend, but no one knew what and no one dared to voice it.

I returned to my station. So far behind in my remaining work that I felt hopeless. I toiled on mechanically, my mind a tumult of uncertainty and dread. My shift came and went, stretching nearly to twelve hours, finally ending after 9:00 a.m. Despite the exhaustion, I couldn't shake the feeling of disbelief over my circumstances. 

I staggered back to my car and drove home.  My second day was over and I found myself wishing I could just ignore the reality of my situation. I went to sleep and tried to forget it all for the small portion of the day I had left, before I had to go back for my third day.",1,1744159768.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I rinse the brew group every weekend, clean the drip trays when needed, lubricate every 4 months, descale when asked, and run a brew group clean once a month. So im on top of the maintenance. I recently have noticed the drip tray is very watery where it usually has a lot of grounds in it, and its filling up very fast now (need to rinse it every 3days vs once a week)



The symptoms and what i've tried:

1) Dispensing 150ml of hot water is accurate

2) Running 'coffee' with the 'preground' (but no actual pregrounds) and set it to 150ml of coffee. 150ml of coffee gets dispensed

3) Try running 'coffee' with our regular settings and set to 150ml, only 75ml is dispensed. When i lower the brew strength from extra strong, it pours a little more than 75ml. If i put extra weak then i get the full 150ml. 

4) Cleaning with the brew group tablets produced a lot less water than usual


Im not sure whats happening here, its like the machine cant handle the pressure of the brew group anymore and the waters just being bypassed to the drip tray. I tried relubricating everything (it all glides very smoothly), cleaning it (including removing the filter from the mesh group and cleaning it thoroughly), running cleaning cycles.

If you want to not disappear too, then just keep your head down, keep quiet and do not rock the boat, the less you know the less danger you are in. I have to go, you should get some sleep and remember what I told you. I am off tomorrow, try and keep safe while I‚Äôm gone, and take care.‚Äù

She threw some money on the table and walked out without another word and I was left stunned and speechless. It sounded like I was stuck and I still had no idea what I had gotten myself into?



My anxiety was palpable and I hardly got any sleep when I returned home. If what Jean said was true, then the place I had just gotten a job at, was hiding a dark secret and I could not uncover it or leave and run away. I was forced for the time being, to continue working for the bizarre company. Continue shifting those mysterious boxes without ever knowing what horrors they might contain.

When it was time to go back, I hesitated and almost considered calling out and not going. But I did not want to attract any unwanted attention just then so I summoned my courage and went back to PT. Shipping for my second day of work.

I arrived a few minutes early, but no one else was there to greet me this time. I shuffled in and grabbed a new manifest from my work station and the tablet. I saw the first shipment was scheduled to arrive in the next ten minutes. Then I looked at the list continue on into another page and realized that there were twice the amount of trucks that day than my first and I had no apparent help, at least with what I would be doing. I thought briefly about the other people I saw leave the building yesterday at 5:00am. Why did they have us sectioned off and not working together? It was another question I would have to set aside. I was going to be very busy and thought that maybe the distraction might be nice.

The first truck backed up to the loading dock with a low rumble that vibrated through the concrete floor. I approached cautiously, remembering Jean's methodical movements from the night before. The keypad by the door blinked expectantly. I punched in the code I'd memorized and stepped back as the doors swung open.

Unlike last night's mysterious black containers, this truck held rows of ordinary-looking wooden crates. They were stacked neatly, secured with straps, each bearing standard shipping labels and barcodes. No strange temperatures. No odd buzzing. Just regular freight. I let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding. Maybe not every shipment contained whatever horrors Jean had alluded to. Maybe some days were just‚Ä¶normal.

The manifest indicated these were ""textile supplies"" for various retail locations across three states. Fabric bolts, perhaps. Sewing machines. Things a company called ""The Proud Tailor"" might legitimately ship.

I worked efficiently, scanning each crate and moving it to its designated staging area. The forklift hummed beneath me, comfortingly mundane. For nearly an hour, I allowed myself to believe I was simply working a regular warehouse job, one that happened to pay extraordinarily well for night shifts. I thought I might be able to relax for a moment, but I heard the staticy voice of Matt through the intercom,

‚ÄúNew guy, second shipment is ahead of schedule. It is a priority shipment. Get down to receiving bay B. Get a move on.‚Äù I was not even done with the first load and now the next one was already coming. I was starting to get stressed out that I was falling behind.

I rushed to bay B, maneuvering the forklift hastily through the narrow aisles. As I rounded the final corner, I caught sight of the back of a sleek black truck, similar to the first one I'd seen last night. My heart immediately began to race, knowing what might be inside.

Just as I approached the loading dock, the forklift sputtered, the engine making a high-pitched whining sound I hadn't heard before. The control panel flickered, lights blinking erratically across the dashboard. I tried to slow down, but the machine lurched forward suddenly, as if pushed by an invisible hand. I yanked the steering wheel to the right, narrowly avoiding a stack of pallets.

The forklift shuddered violently beneath me, the hydraulics screaming in protest. Then, without warning, the lift dropped, not smoothly as designed, but in a single catastrophic release. They slammed into the concrete floor with a deafening crash, sparks flying as metal scraped against concrete.

I was thrown forward against the safety cage, my chest hitting the steering column hard enough to knock the wind from my lungs. The forklift continued its chaotic movement, spinning in a half-circle before the engine cut out completely, leaving me stranded in the middle of the bay.

""What the hell are you doing?"" Matt's voice boomed from somewhere behind me. I turned to see him storming across the warehouse floor, his face contorted with rage.

""I didn't, the forklift just‚Ä¶"" I stammered, still trying to catch my breath.

Matt reached me in seconds, his weathered face inches from mine. ""Get off. Now.""

I scrambled down from the malfunctioning vehicle, my legs shaking. Matt circled the forklift, examining it with narrowed eyes. He ran his hand along the control panel, then knelt to inspect the dropped forks.

""This equipment was checked yesterday,"" he muttered, more to himself than to me. Then his gaze snapped back to my face, eyes cold and calculating. ""God damn interference is worse than normal. Were you near any red-tagged containers earlier?""

""No,"" I answered truthfully. ""I've been unloading the one marked textile shipment so far.""

Matt's jaw tightened as he glanced toward the black truck waiting at the bay. ""Well the timing of this is awful.""

He pulled a radio from his belt. ""Jean, we need you at bay B. Equipment failure."" There was no response, just static. ""Right,"" he sighed. ""She's off today.""

The back doors of the black truck swung open on their own, revealing the now-familiar darkness that seemed deeper than it should be. A soft, rhythmic thumping sound emerged from within, like something repeatedly striking the interior wall.

Matt cursed under his breath. ""Those need to be moved immediately. Temperature-sensitive."" He turned to me. ""You'll have to move them manually.""

""Manually?"" I echoed, my voice cracking. ""You mean carry them?""

""The dollies are in the maintenance closet,"" Matt growled, pointing toward a narrow door across the warehouse. ""Grab one. Quick.""

I jogged to the closet, my mind racing. Manual handling meant direct contact with whatever those black containers held. The thought made my skin crawl, but I had little choice. Matt was watching my every move with increasing impatience. Inside the closet, I found several heavy-duty dollies designed for oversized freight. I selected the sturdiest-looking one and wheeled it back to the bay where Matt stood, arms crossed, foot tapping rhythmically against the concrete.

""Remember the protocol,"" he said as I approached the truck. ""No unnecessary contact. Move them directly to the designated area."" He glanced at his watch. ""I need to make a call. Get this done before I return.""

As Matt disappeared through a side door, I faced the yawning darkness of the truck's interior alone. The thumping had stopped, replaced by an eerie silence that somehow felt worse. I steeled myself and rolled the dolly up the loading ramp.

The first container slid forward as if pushed by unseen hands, just like the night before. Up close, without Jean's calming presence, the experience was infinitely more unsettling. The black surface seemed to absorb the light around it, and as I positioned the dolly beneath one end, I could have sworn the container shifted slightly, adjusting on its own to maintain balance.

I carefully tipped the container back, distributing its considerable weight across the dolly's frame. It was heavier than I expected, at least three hundred pounds. As I began to pull it down the ramp, a vibration traveled up through the handles into my arms, a subtle, rhythmic tremor like a heartbeat.

The container slid off the truck with surprising ease, almost eager to be free of its confined space. I guided it across the warehouse floor toward the staging area Matt had indicated. With each step, the vibration grew more pronounced.

When I reached the staging area, I carefully lowered the container to the ground. As it settled onto the concrete, a sound emerged from within, a kind of soft scraping, like fingernails dragging across the interior surface. I jumped back, nearly losing my grip on the dolly.

The digital display on the container flickered, the temperature reading jumping from -10¬∞C to -8¬∞C, then back again. The scraping sound intensified for a moment, then abruptly stopped.

I stood frozen, staring at the black box. Whatever was sounded like it was moving, scraping. The realization sent ice through my veins, but I couldn't afford to panic. There were still two more containers to move, and Matt would return soon.

Forcing myself back to the truck, I repeated the process with the second container. This one was even heavier, and as I maneuvered it down the ramp, a thin sheen of condensation formed on its surface, immediately turning to frost in the warehouse air. The temperature display read -15¬∞C, colder than the first.

As I positioned it next to the other container, both boxes seemed to shudder simultaneously, as if acknowledging each other's presence. The hair on my arms stood on end, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, not by security cameras or by Matt, but by whatever was sealed inside these mysterious shipments.

I returned for the third and final container, my nerves fraying with each step. This one looked different from the others, slightly larger, with a faint red glow emanating from its temperature display. As I approached, a wave of dizziness washed over me, accompanied by a high-pitched ringing in my ears.

The container slid forward, but unlike the others, it moved aggressively, nearly crushing me against the side of the truck. I stumbled backward, barely catching myself on the loading dock edge.

""Careful,"" Matt said as he walked up behind me. He looked over my shoulder and saw the red glint of the item.

‚ÄúNot sure why this one was not red tagged on the list. Step out please, I am taking this to the secure storage room. I need you to move all the other boxes to cold storage and hurry. I don‚Äôt have anyone else to spare for help at the moment, so just go as fast as you can.‚Äù

I nodded quickly and stepped aside, watching as Matt carefully maneuvered the red-labeled container onto a specialized cart. His movements were precise, almost reverent, as he secured it with straps I hadn't seen used on any other shipment. The container emitted a soft humming noise that made my teeth ache.

""Don't fall behind,"" Matt called over his shoulder as he wheeled the mysterious box away. ""And remember, no unnecessary contact.""

I returned to my task, moving the remaining containers to cold storage with mechanical efficiency. Each one seemed to react differently to being handled, one vibrated intensely when passing certain areas of the warehouse, another grew noticeably heavier near the loading bay doors, as if reluctant to be stored away. I tried to focus solely on the physical labor, to shut down the part of my brain screaming that none of this was normal.

The cold storage area was a maze of shelving units filled with identical black containers. The temperature was brutal, my breath clouding instantly in the frigid air. My fingers grew numb as I positioned each new arrival in its designated spot, guided only by the blinking scanner in my hand. I noticed that some of the older containers had frost patterns forming on their surfaces, not random crystallization, but intricate, almost deliberate designs.

Just as I finished securing the last container, the lights in cold storage flickered. Once, twice, then plunged into darkness for a full three seconds before sputtering back to life. I stood there shivering and regretted not bringing a coat or something warm. Fortunately, I was finished.

Back on the main floor, I discovered that two more trucks had arrived while I'd been occupied in the cold storage area. My heart sank at the sight of the endless freight waiting to be processed. Without the forklift, I'd have to move everything by hand. Matt was nowhere to be found, likely still dealing with that mysterious red-tagged container.

I grabbed another dolly and set to work, my muscles already protesting from the strain of moving the first batch of containers. These new shipments weren't the black boxes but were still unnervingly heavy,crates of ""textile equipment"" according to their manifests, though they weighed far more than any sewing machine I'd ever encountered. 

I tried to maintain a rhythm as I wheeled crate after crate to their designated areas. The warehouse seemed to stretch endlessly before me, distances expanding impossibly between loading dock and staging areas. My shirt clung to my back with sweat despite the building's chill.

After I finished with the trucks, another arrived with dozens of smaller packages needing scanning and sorting. Fatigue made me clumsy, and I fumbled with the scanner, dropping it twice and cracking the casing on the second fall.

The clock on the wall read 2:17 AM. I'd been working non-stop for hours, yet had barely made a dent in the night's shipments. The manifest on my tablet showed three more trucks scheduled before dawn

I felt a spike of panic rise in my chest. There was simply no way I could finish all this alone.

I worked non-stop, skipping whatever time I would have taken for a break. I was tired hungry and exhausted and no one else was around to help. I lost track of time and to my horror I heard the 5am alarm go off. I dropped a box I was carrying and it crashed to the floor. I was scared to look down at it, but when I did I saw the box had not opened.

I bolted to the exit just in time, feeling the adrenaline surging through my veins as I burst out, immediately catching the anxious stares of a few coworkers from other sections of the warehouse. Their eyes were wide with concern, clearly worried about the chaos erupting behind me. As I hurried further away, I desperately tried to block out the ominous noises that began to echo, a sinister sound building in the distance. Suddenly, a whisper sliced through the tension, urgently vying for my attention.

""Hey, you! Did you see Mike? From Section 4? He was supposed to be right behind me."" I shook my head, and watched as the blood drained from the man's face.

I was about to offer some reassurance when the air was pierced by an intensifying buzzing and screeching sound, a cacophony that made my skin crawl. The others turned away, unwilling to face the impending horror, but the man who had questioned me stood frozen, fear etched on his features. The terrifying sounds from yesterday crescendoed once more, each note now carrying the unmistakable clarity of a person‚Äôs voice, a desperate cry for help. A scream tore through the air, sharp and chilling, and then everything plunged into an eerie, suffocating silence.

I turned away, closing my eyes, and tried to steady my thoughts as I waited. Eventually, someone announced we had just one minute before maintenance time ended. We lined up to return to our stations, and I caught sight of the man who had asked about his co-worker, shuffling despondently behind me. His face was a mask of hopelessness and despair. We all had a sense that something terrible had happened to his friend, but no one knew what and no one dared to voice it.

I returned to my station. So far behind in my remaining work that I felt hopeless. I toiled on mechanically, my mind a tumult of uncertainty and dread. My shift came and went, stretching nearly to twelve hours, finally ending after 9:00 a.m. Despite the exhaustion, I couldn't shake the feeling of disbelief over my circumstances. 

I staggered back to my car and drove home.  My second day was over and I found myself wishing I could just ignore the reality of my situation. I went to sleep and tried to forget it all for the small portion of the day I had left, before I had to go back for my third day.",2,1744159647.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

-insinuated he knows where I go after work (and that he watches which direction I drive in)

-was driving behind me on a coffee break when I was going to get coffee, honked at me the whole way there and whilst in the drive thru
-when arriving at work, he was behind another person in their car, and suddenly dissapeared, then pulled into our work lot behind me when I arrived a few minutes later (a very short road right in front of our lot, not anywhere he reasonably could have gone)

Things had been going incredibly well, had our first ""official"" date after many little coffee/lunch dates. Had an amazing time, first kiss, called each other and talked all the way home. Next day we lamented that we had to work and couldn't hang out. She said she had ""all the feels""...anyway...all the good stuff.  She's (43f) and separated for 3.5 years. I'm (45m) and divorced myself. Early on we spoke about priorities in life and she made it very clear hers was her children...I completely understand, I have a kid too who is my world. She just re-entered the dating world after taking a year away and I was the first person she dated. I guess to try to keep this short, despite that things were going EXTREMELY well, we had found less and less time to be able to hang out and she told me that ""maybe she's not in a place in life to be dating anyone and that waiting around for us to find a few nights wasn't fair to me."" I said I completely understood where her priorities lay and that I was fine with taking things slowly, she thanked me for my patience and talked about getting together later that weekend. Fast forward 3 days...hadn't heard a peep from her, no calls, no texts, nothing and then we have a call and she said again that she's not in a place in life to be in a relationship right now an is prioritizing reconnecting with her friends, fitness, getting back in touch with her own body, health, therapy, and of course kids (keep in mind she is a breast cancer survivor - double mastectomy with reconstruction and hysterectomy in the last 2.5 years). I again said I was comfortable taking things as slowly as she needed. Again, heard nothing for three days, then today I texted and said we should get together for coffee since this is something she said we should do on our last phone call. She said that wouldn't be a good idea. I asked what had changed over the course of the last 5 days. She said ""I don't need to justify that I'm not interested."" I said I understood, said it was great getting to know her and wished her the best. Any insight out there on what on earth happened? She did say early on that she's an Avoidant Attachment style person and has a tendency to run, in fact when we first started dating her therapist was excited for her and said they needed to focus on breaking those patterns of running. I know this is dense, as am I apparently. Is there another guy? Is it true that she just wasn't ready for a relationship and the fact that I said I was ok with that spooked her?

4) Shook hands with and served coffee to anti-vaxx, extremist trucker convoys which brought Ottawa to a standstill a few years ago. Since then, the organisers have been charged legally on ‚Äòmischief‚Äô charges and fined.

5) Poilievre has also flirted himself with anti-vaccine and climate change denying talking points. And is extremely hostile to the media answering tough questions from journalists with harsh epithets like ‚Äúfake news‚Äù etc. 

6) Furthermore, he refuses to get a security clearance when every other candidate has.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs kinda ironic that Trump‚Äôs threats of annexing Canada and making it the 51st State, plus the tariffs have possibly saved Canada from a disastrous election outcome. We very well could have had (and still might) TWO MAGA extremists running USA and Canada.

Also, there are recent polls suggesting that around 30% of hard-right conservative Albertans and Saskatchewan residents want to leave Canada if the Liberals win again and are open to joining USA as a 51st state.

**This is the state of modern conservatism around the Western World folks.**

I say this as a warning ‚ö†Ô∏è, be very careful and skeptical of Never Trump conservatives singing the praises of Javier Milei or Pierre Poilievre. The center-right is mostly dead, populist, angry, anti-immigrant, anti-elite and conspiratorial anti-science conservatism is the new flavour.

1jut1jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jut1jj/the_things_we_leave_behind/,the things we leave behind,"the house still smelled like her

two years, seven months and twelve days after she was gone and i could still catch it in the quiet- lavender and lemon the perfume she used to wear only on sundays as if she was trying to smell like sunshine, i told myself it was the furniture or maybe just my memory playing cruel tricks but when i stood in the kitchen at night sometimes it felt like she was just in the next room, still humming, still there

she used to make breakfast while barefoot, dancing around the cold kitchen tiles with a mug of coffee in hand, half-drunk and laughing about something i‚Äôd said in my sleep. she had a habit of touching me when she passed just a brush of fingers along my back like a whisper that said *I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm yours.* and i was, god i was

she died on a tuesday

it had been an ordinary morning, rain on the windows, coffee on the counter, a kiss at the door, i remembered the way she smiled at me umbrella tucked under one arm coat open because she was always late always rushing, ‚ÄúLove you,‚Äù she said over her shoulder

and that was it, that was the last thing

a drunk driver ran a red light, she was crossing the street barely twenty feet from her office, they said it was instant, no pain, like that was supposed to comfort me, like knowing she never had the chance to scream would make it easier to wake up every morning in a bed too cold and a house too quiet

i stopped working, friends called, i didn‚Äôt answer, i couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of anyone saying ‚Äúit‚Äôll get better‚Äù when they didn‚Äôt know, they didn‚Äôt know, they hadn‚Äôt traced the outline of her body into the sheets like it was sacred, they hadn‚Äôt found her favorite scarf tucked into the hall closet three months after the funeral and sunk to the floor sobbing like a child

i started going through her things one rainy afternoon because the silence was unbearable, not to throw anything away, i just‚Ä¶ needed to touch the world she‚Äôd left behind

in the drawer by her nightstand i found letters

dozens of them, all addressed to me, some sealed, some just pages held together with a paperclip, each one written in her unmistakable handwriting a little loopy a little messy like she was always in a rush to say something important

*Dear ......,*  
*If you‚Äôre reading this, then I‚Äôm probably gone, and you‚Äôre probably crying, and I‚Äôm probably wishing I could hold you one more time.*

i cried over the first letter for three hours straight

the second one talked about the night we met how she‚Äôd known -just known- that i was going to wreck her heart in the best way

the fifth one said, *I always knew I wouldn‚Äôt get forever with you. That‚Äôs the thing about us. We burned too brightly. But I wouldn‚Äôt trade a single second, not even the fights about stupid things like laundry or the time you forgot my birthday.*

i read them all over the next month rationing them like oxygen

in the final one the envelope was addressed in a different pen, her handwriting was shakier, it read:

*......, for when you‚Äôre ready.*

*It‚Äôs okay to fall in love again.*  
*It‚Äôs okay to laugh so hard your ribs ache.*  
*It‚Äôs okay to remember me on quiet days and still feel like crying.*  
*I want you to build a world again. Even if I‚Äôm not in it.*  
*You were never mine to keep, my love.*  
*You were always just on loan from the universe.*  
*And I‚Äôm so, so grateful I got to borrow you.*

i read that letter a thousand times, i kept it in my wallet

two years later i met someone

she was nothing like her- quiet reserved with eyes that watched the world like it was a story she hadn‚Äôt decided how to read yet, i told her everything eventually, about her, about the letters, about the ache in my chest that had never really gone away

and she didn‚Äôt run

instead she said ‚Äúi hope you loved her the way she deserved‚Äù

i did

years passed, we had a daughter, we named our daughter a similar name to her because she deserved to live on in the laughter of a child, she had her mother‚Äôs smile, not my wife‚Äôs, hers, somehow

on what would‚Äôve been her 40th birthday i visited her grave for the first time in a year, i brought lilies like always, i knelt in the grass and told her everything, about my daughter, about my wife, about the way the world had kept turning even though for a long time i hadn‚Äôt wanted it to

and then i whispered ‚Äúi still miss you, i always will‚Äù

1jusx3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/laundry/comments/1jusx3n/how_to_remove_overpowering_laundry_smell_on/,How to remove OVERPOWERING laundry smell on non-washable objects.,"I know that many brands of detergent just smell strong to begin with, but you can tell when somebody overuses far too much detergent when you walk into their house and BAM you're hit with that super strong laundry ""fragrance"". It even lingers on you after you leave their house until you wash it off your clothes and your body. I dont like the smell of mild detergent to begin with, so it's very overwhelming to walk into a house for less than 10 minutes and walk out smelling like their laundry fragrances/chemicals.

So my question: What about things you can't wash? I recently bought a used item (a computer component) that smells like laundry, and it's gross! I seriously smell strong laundry fragrance on an electronic item... it's crazy! How can I get rid of this smell on the object?

A lot of places recommend using vinegar/soda/castile in the washing process. Has anybody had success using those on other non-clothes items? I cannot rinse this item with water or it will become damaged. So only mild surface rubbing with a paper towel or something.

I'm considering rubbing alcohol. Maybe even trying something like putting this item in a closed container with another strong smell such as coffee grounds. Thoughts and tips would be appreciated. Thanks!",3,1744158349.0,laundry,3,1.0,False

The drive to Denny's gave me time to think, maybe too much time. Every scenario my mind conjured was worse than the last. Drug smuggling. Organ harvesting. Human trafficking. None of them quite fit what I suspected I saw, or at least thought I saw. Based on the hints and unnerving glimpses I really did not know anything for sure about what was really going on at PT. Shipping, yet anything seemed plausible.

Jean was already there when I arrived, tucked into a booth in the far corner, nursing a cup of coffee. She'd changed out of her work clothes into jeans and a faded sweatshirt, but the severe bun remained, pulling her features taut.

""You came,"" she said as I slid into the seat across from her. ""Wasn't sure you would.""

""Of course, what was it you wanted to tell me? I was sort of hoping that it might be a bit more about what the hell we are moving in that place."" I replied, keeping my voice low despite the nearly empty restaurant. ""What I heard last night, what I saw‚Ä¶""

""You didn't see anything,"" Jean interrupted, her eyes hard. ""That's the first thing you need to understand. If you're going to survive this job, you need to accept that some things cannot be explained. Or rather, should not be explained.""

A waitress approached, but Jean waved her away with a practiced gesture. The woman retreated without a word, as if she recognized something in Jean that warned against interruption.

""I can't just pretend I didn't hear anything. I mean come on, are we even safe?"" I asked, leaning forward. ""Something is wrong with those containers. Something was buzzing, maybe even scratching inside them. Then there were the screams during that so-called maintenance period.""

Jean's hand shot across the table, gripping my wrist with painful intensity. Her fingernails dug into my skin as she pulled me closer.

""Lower your voice,"" she hissed. Her eyes, I noticed for the first time, weren't just tired, they held a kind of haunted knowledge that made me falter.

""Yes, there were sounds. Yes, there were things in those containers that probably don't fit into your neat little understanding of the world. But knowing more won't help you. It will only make things worse. And no, strictly speaking we are not what you would probably call safe. But the only way to guarantee you are not safe, is to keep openly asking questions.""

She released my wrist, leaving small crescent marks where her nails had been. I rubbed the spot, watching as she took another sip of her coffee, her hands trembling slightly.

""I can't keep working there,"" I said finally. ""Whatever's happening, it's messed up. At this point the whole thing seems like it is a front for something massively illegal. I don‚Äôt know how much you aren‚Äôt telling me, but maybe we could go to the police. With everything we suspect, someone would have to investigate.""

A harsh, bitter laugh escaped Jean's lips, drawing glances from the few other early morning patrons. She leaned back in the booth, suddenly looking almost defeated.

""You have no idea what you're dealing with,"" she said, her voice dropping to a whisper. ""The police? They already know. Or at least, certain people in the department do. Why do you think we operate so openly? Why do we have business licenses and tax ID numbers? This isn't some fly-by-night operation, PT has connections.""

""What kind of connections could possibly allow them to‚Ä¶""

""Powerful ones,"" Jean cut me off. ""Look, I've seen people like you before. Decent, moral people who think they can change things. Who think they can expose what's happening and make it stop."" She leaned forward again, her eyes locking with mine. ""Remember Jacob? The guy who had your job before you?"" I shook my head.

""Exactly. No one remembers Jacob. He decided to be a hero too. Took photos on his phone of one of the containers. Tried to open one when no one was looking."" Her voice caught slightly. ""Two days later, his apartment was empty. All his things were gone. Like he never existed. His mother filed a missing persons report. Nothing came of it.""

A cold weight settled in my stomach. ""You're saying they killed him?""

Jean's eyes darted around the restaurant before returning to mine. ""I'm saying he disappeared. Just like Marissa before him, and David before her. People who ask too many questions don't last long at PT.""

I swallowed hard and considered her words. It was too much at that point and I just resolved to get out. I told Jean my plan,

‚ÄúOkay then, I will just quit. I don‚Äôt like it, but if something dangerous or illegal is going on that could just disappear me, then I will just leave. I can even put in a two weeks notice, so they don‚Äôt think it is because I suspect something.""

Jean laughed, a harsh and hollow sound. She looked at me like I was an unruly child.

‚ÄúYou think that they believe anyone could be so dense as to not suspect something? Even after one night?‚Äù

""So then what can I do? Why are you telling me this?‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed and she responded,

‚ÄúBecause you need to know, that you can‚Äôt just quit now. You are in this, whether you like it or not. If you want to not disappear too, then just keep your head down, keep quiet and do not rock the boat, the less you know the less danger you are in. I have to go, you should get some sleep and remember what I told you. I am off tomorrow, try and keep safe while I‚Äôm gone, and take care.‚Äù

She threw some money on the table and walked out without another word and I was left stunned and speechless. It sounded like I was stuck and I still had no idea what I had gotten myself into?



My anxiety was palpable and I hardly got any sleep when I returned home. If what Jean said was true, then the place I had just gotten a job at, was hiding a dark secret and I could not uncover it or leave and run away. I was forced for the time being, to continue working for the bizarre company. Continue shifting those mysterious boxes without ever knowing what horrors they might contain.

When it was time to go back, I hesitated and almost considered calling out and not going. But I did not want to attract any unwanted attention just then so I summoned my courage and went back to PT. Shipping for my second day of work.

I arrived a few minutes early, but no one else was there to greet me this time. I shuffled in and grabbed a new manifest from my work station and the tablet. I saw the first shipment was scheduled to arrive in the next ten minutes. Then I looked at the list continue on into another page and realized that there were twice the amount of trucks that day than my first and I had no apparent help, at least with what I would be doing. I thought briefly about the other people I saw leave the building yesterday at 5:00am. Why did they have us sectioned off and not working together? It was another question I would have to set aside. I was going to be very busy and thought that maybe the distraction might be nice.

The first truck backed up to the loading dock with a low rumble that vibrated through the concrete floor. I approached cautiously, remembering Jean's methodical movements from the night before. The keypad by the door blinked expectantly. I punched in the code I'd memorized and stepped back as the doors swung open.

Unlike last night's mysterious black containers, this truck held rows of ordinary-looking wooden crates. They were stacked neatly, secured with straps, each bearing standard shipping labels and barcodes. No strange temperatures. No odd buzzing. Just regular freight. I let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding. Maybe not every shipment contained whatever horrors Jean had alluded to. Maybe some days were just‚Ä¶normal.

The manifest indicated these were ""textile supplies"" for various retail locations across three states. Fabric bolts, perhaps. Sewing machines. Things a company called ""The Proud Tailor"" might legitimately ship.

I worked efficiently, scanning each crate and moving it to its designated staging area. The forklift hummed beneath me, comfortingly mundane. For nearly an hour, I allowed myself to believe I was simply working a regular warehouse job, one that happened to pay extraordinarily well for night shifts. I thought I might be able to relax for a moment, but I heard the staticy voice of Matt through the intercom,

‚ÄúNew guy, second shipment is ahead of schedule. It is a priority shipment. Get down to receiving bay B. Get a move on.‚Äù I was not even done with the first load and now the next one was already coming. I was starting to get stressed out that I was falling behind.

I rushed to bay B, maneuvering the forklift hastily through the narrow aisles. As I rounded the final corner, I caught sight of the back of a sleek black truck, similar to the first one I'd seen last night. My heart immediately began to race, knowing what might be inside.

Just as I approached the loading dock, the forklift sputtered, the engine making a high-pitched whining sound I hadn't heard before. The control panel flickered, lights blinking erratically across the dashboard. I tried to slow down, but the machine lurched forward suddenly, as if pushed by an invisible hand. I yanked the steering wheel to the right, narrowly avoiding a stack of pallets.

The forklift shuddered violently beneath me, the hydraulics screaming in protest. Then, without warning, the lift dropped, not smoothly as designed, but in a single catastrophic release. They slammed into the concrete floor with a deafening crash, sparks flying as metal scraped against concrete.

I was thrown forward against the safety cage, my chest hitting the steering column hard enough to knock the wind from my lungs. The forklift continued its chaotic movement, spinning in a half-circle before the engine cut out completely, leaving me stranded in the middle of the bay.

""What the hell are you doing?"" Matt's voice boomed from somewhere behind me. I turned to see him storming across the warehouse floor, his face contorted with rage.

""I didn't, the forklift just‚Ä¶"" I stammered, still trying to catch my breath.

Matt reached me in seconds, his weathered face inches from mine. ""Get off. Now.""

I scrambled down from the malfunctioning vehicle, my legs shaking. Matt circled the forklift, examining it with narrowed eyes. He ran his hand along the control panel, then knelt to inspect the dropped forks.

""This equipment was checked yesterday,"" he muttered, more to himself than to me. Then his gaze snapped back to my face, eyes cold and calculating. ""God damn interference is worse than normal. Were you near any red-tagged containers earlier?""

""No,"" I answered truthfully. ""I've been unloading the one marked textile shipment so far.""

Matt's jaw tightened as he glanced toward the black truck waiting at the bay. ""Well the timing of this is awful.""

He pulled a radio from his belt. ""Jean, we need you at bay B. Equipment failure."" There was no response, just static. ""Right,"" he sighed. ""She's off today.""

The back doors of the black truck swung open on their own, revealing the now-familiar darkness that seemed deeper than it should be. A soft, rhythmic thumping sound emerged from within, like something repeatedly striking the interior wall.

Matt cursed under his breath. ""Those need to be moved immediately. Temperature-sensitive."" He turned to me. ""You'll have to move them manually.""

""Manually?"" I echoed, my voice cracking. ""You mean carry them?""

""The dollies are in the maintenance closet,"" Matt growled, pointing toward a narrow door across the warehouse. ""Grab one. Quick.""

I jogged to the closet, my mind racing. Manual handling meant direct contact with whatever those black containers held. The thought made my skin crawl, but I had little choice. Matt was watching my every move with increasing impatience. Inside the closet, I found several heavy-duty dollies designed for oversized freight. I selected the sturdiest-looking one and wheeled it back to the bay where Matt stood, arms crossed, foot tapping rhythmically against the concrete.

""Remember the protocol,"" he said as I approached the truck. ""No unnecessary contact. Move them directly to the designated area."" He glanced at his watch. ""I need to make a call. Get this done before I return.""

As Matt disappeared through a side door, I faced the yawning darkness of the truck's interior alone. The thumping had stopped, replaced by an eerie silence that somehow felt worse. I steeled myself and rolled the dolly up the loading ramp.

The first container slid forward as if pushed by unseen hands, just like the night before. Up close, without Jean's calming presence, the experience was infinitely more unsettling. The black surface seemed to absorb the light around it, and as I positioned the dolly beneath one end, I could have sworn the container shifted slightly, adjusting on its own to maintain balance.

I carefully tipped the container back, distributing its considerable weight across the dolly's frame. It was heavier than I expected, at least three hundred pounds. As I began to pull it down the ramp, a vibration traveled up through the handles into my arms, a subtle, rhythmic tremor like a heartbeat.

The container slid off the truck with surprising ease, almost eager to be free of its confined space. I guided it across the warehouse floor toward the staging area Matt had indicated. With each step, the vibration grew more pronounced.

When I reached the staging area, I carefully lowered the container to the ground. As it settled onto the concrete, a sound emerged from within, a kind of soft scraping, like fingernails dragging across the interior surface. I jumped back, nearly losing my grip on the dolly.

The digital display on the container flickered, the temperature reading jumping from -10¬∞C to -8¬∞C, then back again. The scraping sound intensified for a moment, then abruptly stopped.

I stood frozen, staring at the black box. Whatever was sounded like it was moving, scraping. The realization sent ice through my veins, but I couldn't afford to panic. There were still two more containers to move, and Matt would return soon.

Forcing myself back to the truck, I repeated the process with the second container. This one was even heavier, and as I maneuvered it down the ramp, a thin sheen of condensation formed on its surface, immediately turning to frost in the warehouse air. The temperature display read -15¬∞C, colder than the first.

As I positioned it next to the other container, both boxes seemed to shudder simultaneously, as if acknowledging each other's presence. The hair on my arms stood on end, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, not by security cameras or by Matt, but by whatever was sealed inside these mysterious shipments.

I returned for the third and final container, my nerves fraying with each step. This one looked different from the others, slightly larger, with a faint red glow emanating from its temperature display. As I approached, a wave of dizziness washed over me, accompanied by a high-pitched ringing in my ears.

The container slid forward, but unlike the others, it moved aggressively, nearly crushing me against the side of the truck. I stumbled backward, barely catching myself on the loading dock edge.

""Careful,"" Matt said as he walked up behind me. He looked over my shoulder and saw the red glint of the item.

‚ÄúNot sure why this one was not red tagged on the list. Step out please, I am taking this to the secure storage room. I need you to move all the other boxes to cold storage and hurry. I don‚Äôt have anyone else to spare for help at the moment, so just go as fast as you can.‚Äù

I nodded quickly and stepped aside, watching as Matt carefully maneuvered the red-labeled container onto a specialized cart. His movements were precise, almost reverent, as he secured it with straps I hadn't seen used on any other shipment. The container emitted a soft humming noise that made my teeth ache.

""Don't fall behind,"" Matt called over his shoulder as he wheeled the mysterious box away. ""And remember, no unnecessary contact.""

I returned to my task, moving the remaining containers to cold storage with mechanical efficiency. Each one seemed to react differently to being handled, one vibrated intensely when passing certain areas of the warehouse, another grew noticeably heavier near the loading bay doors, as if reluctant to be stored away. I tried to focus solely on the physical labor, to shut down the part of my brain screaming that none of this was normal.

The cold storage area was a maze of shelving units filled with identical black containers. The temperature was brutal, my breath clouding instantly in the frigid air. My fingers grew numb as I positioned each new arrival in its designated spot, guided only by the blinking scanner in my hand. I noticed that some of the older containers had frost patterns forming on their surfaces, not random crystallization, but intricate, almost deliberate designs.

Just as I finished securing the last container, the lights in cold storage flickered. Once, twice, then plunged into darkness for a full three seconds before sputtering back to life. I stood there shivering and regretted not bringing a coat or something warm. Fortunately, I was finished.

Back on the main floor, I discovered that two more trucks had arrived while I'd been occupied in the cold storage area. My heart sank at the sight of the endless freight waiting to be processed. Without the forklift, I'd have to move everything by hand. Matt was nowhere to be found, likely still dealing with that mysterious red-tagged container.

I grabbed another dolly and set to work, my muscles already protesting from the strain of moving the first batch of containers. These new shipments weren't the black boxes but were still unnervingly heavy,crates of ""textile equipment"" according to their manifests, though they weighed far more than any sewing machine I'd ever encountered. 

I tried to maintain a rhythm as I wheeled crate after crate to their designated areas. The warehouse seemed to stretch endlessly before me, distances expanding impossibly between loading dock and staging areas. My shirt clung to my back with sweat despite the building's chill.

After I finished with the trucks, another arrived with dozens of smaller packages needing scanning and sorting. Fatigue made me clumsy, and I fumbled with the scanner, dropping it twice and cracking the casing on the second fall.

The clock on the wall read 2:17 AM. I'd been working non-stop for hours, yet had barely made a dent in the night's shipments. The manifest on my tablet showed three more trucks scheduled before dawn

I felt a spike of panic rise in my chest. There was simply no way I could finish all this alone.

I worked non-stop, skipping whatever time I would have taken for a break. I was tired hungry and exhausted and no one else was around to help. I lost track of time and to my horror I heard the 5am alarm go off. I dropped a box I was carrying and it crashed to the floor. I was scared to look down at it, but when I did I saw the box had not opened.

I bolted to the exit just in time, feeling the adrenaline surging through my veins as I burst out, immediately catching the anxious stares of a few coworkers from other sections of the warehouse. Their eyes were wide with fear, clearly worried about the chaos erupting behind me. As I hurried further away, I desperately tried to block out the ominous noises that began to echo, a sinister sound building in the distance. Suddenly, a whisper sliced through the tension, urgently vying for my attention.

""Hey, you! Did you see Mike? From Section 4? He was supposed to be right behind me."" I shook my head, and watched as the blood drained from the man's face.

I was about to offer some reassurance when the air was pierced by an intensifying buzzing and screeching sound, a cacophony that made my skin crawl. The others turned away, unwilling to face the impending horror, but the man who had questioned me stood frozen, fear etched on his features. The terrifying sounds from yesterday crescendoed once more, each note carrying the unmistakable clarity of a person‚Äôs voice, a desperate cry for help. A scream tore through the air, sharp and chilling, and then everything plunged into an eerie, suffocating silence.

I turned away, closing my eyes, and tried to steady my thoughts as I waited. Eventually, someone announced we had just one minute before maintenance time ended. We lined up to return to our stations, and I caught sight of the man who had asked about his co-worker, shuffling despondently behind me. His face was a mask of hopelessness and despair. We all had a sense that something terrible had happened to his friend, but no one knew what and no one dared to voice it.

I returned to my station. So far behind in my remaining work that I felt hopeless. I worked mechanically, my mind a tumult of uncertainty and dread. My shift came and went, stretching nearly to twelve hours, finally ending after 9:00 a.m. Despite the exhaustion, I couldn't shake the feeling of disbelief over my circumstances.

1jusrl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DandysWorld_/comments/1jusrl4/qwel_is_not_investing_in_lore_so_ill_make_a_ton/,Qwel is not investing in lore so i'll make a ton of theories (obese text incoming),"This lore is dry as hell and some characters are extremely boring in both terms of design AND personality. (looks slowly at sprout)

Let me explain. There has not been a new storyboard since sprout update im sure. Sprout doesnt even have a goddamn emotion sheet. Dandy also doesnt, and Bobbette doesnt too. Also how is bobette a main character if she only appears in a few episodes in only a time of the month? We have basically no idea about what ichor actually really is, the only thing we know is that it seems to be the toon's blood and that it has solid and liquid forms. Each thing in the lore that is revealed ends up in more questions that, some of these questions have been since in the start of the game, and Qwel didnt invest anything on these questions. ""B-but!! the game is in alpha!!"" That does not excuse the fact that she doesnt really invest in lore, and a lot of things should've been answered already by some random ahh paper that Delilah wrote or something. We havent gotten any updates in roleplay mode (excluding adding new twisteds and toons) since it got released. Before you say ""but roleplay doesnt have anything to do with lore!"" Two words; Toon rooms. Just look at glisten's room, theres things that he wrote, himself.

About personality, Sprout's personality is just Cosmo and a sprinkle of baking. Add a little bit salt of overprotectiveness. By this i dont mean that his personality is the same as cosmo's (though they do like baking but having the same likings doesnt mean they are the same), but that his personality is literally wrapped around cosmo. Dialogue with cosmo? worried about cosmo.  Interaction with rodger? dont mess with cosmo. One of the interactions with shelly? cosmo will join us or else i wont. Other interaction with shelly? Cosmo is learning with boxten. Interaction with shrimpo? Dont talk like that to my friend cosmo!!!! Interaction with teagan? Cosmo will come to the party so i'll consider. Interaction with flutter? Cosmo cried for a week because of gumballs melting. Interaction with bobbette? Oh yeah ginger, cosmo's cousin! This dude sounds like hes doing a 24/7 service for cosmo in premium mode while recieving no payment.. holy shit how is this dude not the forgotten main bro oh my god üò≠üò≠. Theres also other toons (Rudie literally only yapping abt christmas, goob being mostly about hugs, finn being a stupid creature + fish puns, brightney basically talking about smartass shit that half of the fanbase hasnt even heard about due to 70% of the fanbase being children)

**SO HERE COMES THE THEORIES!! will be edited in the future to add more**

i have a theory where the reason dandy needs tapes is to revive his memories and not become twisted. Meaning that tapes is the key to not getting twisted. Which is why teagan uses tapes to heal herself and sprout uses tapes to produce healthy cupcakes that heal hearts. When a twisted has enough tapes to watch, they seemingly become normal and can control theirselves back again. (before you say ""ohh uhm but theres twisted finn! he's legless!"" He uses pants so the ichor can be covered by his pants. and before you say ""ginger! she lost an arm!!"" she can produce sweets to replace her arm.. OR maybe another answer for both of them could be that their original twisted had these parts of the body but somehow got ripped off). Dandy wants tapes in stage 2 because he doesn't wanna become twisted later. Dandy NEEDS tapes in stage 3 because he WILL become twisted if he doesnt get tapes. The reason why he goes back later is that he collects the tapes by collecting them in the floor or by killing the players, which is why in his killing animation he looks like hes not only smashing something, but also collecting something. Twisted Teagan doesn't heal because she cant control herself properly and does not know how to - or wants to kill a bit more before she transforms back.

It is also likely that the toon handlers possibly handle more than one toon, but could be wrong too since Shanon Mendez sends a text by a paper only for specifically shelly. Arthur seemed to be the Concept artist and Delilah somehow produced the Toons. Delilah is very likely to be the villain due to trying to be ""realistic"" by brushing off problems. By the notes scattered behind, it could also be assumed she had a passionate attitude in her work as Arthur doted on her alot and was likely a workaholic too due to her dependency on coffee and the fact that according to Arthur she would never fail.

It seems to be also implied that Gardenview could've been owned by another person before Arthur and Delilah, ORR that Delilah was trying to ""remove"" Arthur from the team, due to Austin saying ""Hey didn't Delilah tell one of us to throw out the old 'founders' photos?"".

Now solving the problem i pointed out before, Sprout seems to be a bit uncareful and messy when it comes to cooking, due to Sam (his toon handler) saying ""¬†I'll get to it eventually, been too busy with Sprout"" ""¬†Too busy making sure this place doesn't burn down, I need this job!"" and shown in sprout's interaction with Tisha. Sprout also seems to be a bit dependant on Cosmo or probably just straight up extremely scared to lose him, OR probably the reverse, where Cosmo could be dependant on Sprout but Sprout knows it and tries to make him more comfortable by mentioning him more in conversations, which the reason that made me form this theory is because of twisted Cosmo's description ""Being overcome by Ichor and separated from his best friend has driven this Twisted to chase Toons down.""

Also it seems like each main character Twisted has an emotion that takes over them. Bobette is Envy, Pebble is Wrath OR being Territorialist, Astro is Guilt, Vee is a robot so she probably has trouble expressing too much emotions, Shelly is Rage, Sprout is Loneliness. Bobette is envious due to her making presents for everyone, pebble is like that because its a dog protecting his owner, Vee is vee, Shelly is raged due to her being forgotten, sprout is lonely due to being separated from his best friend. But Astro? Not explained yet, so i have a theory that Astro was the first one to see Twisted Dandy (due to one of his requirements being ""Encounter Twisted Dandy""), so he could be likely guiltful for not trying to stop Dandy or lacking on warning his friends about Dandy. Astro's other emotion is Despair (lack of hope), which could also be caused due to him possibly thinking that Astro, he himself, was the only one that could possibly give some light to his friends, and it would be already too late for Dandy to realize what he did. Another theory is that Astro possibly drinks ichor from the machine so he can mantain infected due to hope being gone, OR him trying to stop ichor from being produced and collected by Dandy or the players for the evil

We stayed at the Mokara so got a full taste of the river walk (a little too chilly for the rooftop pool). Enjoyed the tour of the the Alamo. I honestly did not know the story. We also checked out the Mission San Jose.

Foodwise we started Saturday morning at the Original Donut Shop. The donut was good but the tacos were really good. I'm not usually a flour tortilla guy but it was absolutely perfect with the barbacoa. A very juicy taco. On Sunday we went to Los Norte√±os Pollos Asados and the chicken was phenomenal- a full meal for $20! Special shoutout for the beans. On Sunday we tried Luz Roja which is 3 weeks old. Solid Mexican food. Monday morning we were going to go to La Panaderia but I got too impatient in line and ended up getting coffee and breakfast burrito at Revolucion Cafe. Monday afternoon was a special treat of BBQ at Pinkertons where our eyes were bigger than our stomach. We actually had leftovers but gave it to a homeless guy and his dog. I hope they enjoyed.

Hi guys, so I work at a coffee shop and I‚Äôve been alluding to starting a book club as our shop has been adamant on uniting the community. Before I begin a book club with our customers, I would like to do a test run with our employees. 

Most of my team is very sweet and a lot of them try, however, I do not see much motivation within them to do be good or even great at their job. A lot of people may think ok well it‚Äôs just a coffee shop who takes it that seriously, but honestly, I need them to take their job seriously. Most are in their twenties and I cannot believe they‚Äôve made it this far with the work ethic they have. To conclude, my criteria for book recs is as follows: I need to feel motivation from within, need the book to be less than 200 pages, and a somewhat easy read, all while still being interesting and engaging. I plan on announcing the commencement of the book club in a week so I will take as many suggestions as possible.

So here it is. 

I can still hear the damn alarm‚Äîevery morning at 6:00 AM, without fail. A shriek of metal and sirens. Back then, I didn‚Äôt know it meant safety. Now, it‚Äôs the only sound that lets me sleep at night.

Sable Ridge Warehouse looked normal from the outside‚Äîbig, beige, sprawling across the edge of town like an open wound. It had that dead fluorescent hum, the kind that soaked into your bones after a long shift. The first time I saw it, I thought, Easy money. Just boxes and forklifts. But I didn‚Äôt know about the basement. No one ever talked about the basement.

Keith, the groundskeeper, was a wiry old man with greasy hair, yellow teeth, and the eyes of someone who hadn‚Äôt slept right in years. Always wore that red flannel jacket. People said he‚Äôd been there longer than the concrete had. Didn‚Äôt say much. Kept to himself. But he watched. Always watching.

One week in, he asked me if I‚Äôd be willing to take a special shift‚Äîjust one night a year. Double pay. Nothing hard, just inventory and ‚Äúwatching the place.‚Äù Me and three others‚ÄîMaria, Donnie, and Reece. I didn‚Äôt know them well. Just names and nods in the break room. I said yes. I needed the money. God help me, I said yes.

That night, Keith met us at the door at 5:45 PM. He smiled, but it wasn‚Äôt the kind of smile you want to see on someone‚Äôs face. It was too wide. Too knowing.

‚ÄúOnce you‚Äôre in, you‚Äôre in,‚Äù he said, locking the door behind us. ‚ÄúNo phones. No leaving. Just keep your eyes open.‚Äù

He left before 6:00 hit. That‚Äôs when the power cut. Everything went black for a second before the emergency lights kicked in. Red. Everything was red. The same lights you see in submarine movies before a torpedo hits.

Then the alarm stopped.

That‚Äôs when I felt it.

This‚Ä¶ shift in the air. Like something had been waiting, just below the surface, and now it was free.

It started with the sound. Wet. Slithering. Heavy steps dragging something‚Ä¶ loose.

Maria was the first to go. She was checking the loading bay doors. One minute she was talking‚Äî‚ÄúThis is bullshit, I‚Äôm gonna find a way out‚Äù‚Äîthe next, screaming. We found only blood. No body. Just a trail smeared across the polished floor, vanishing into the darkness.

Donnie panicked. He bolted toward the front entrance, but the doors were welded shut. Not locked‚Äîwelded. I‚Äôll never forget his voice, raw and trembling, echoing off the metal: ‚ÄúHe locked us in. That old bastard knew!‚Äù

The creature didn‚Äôt attack all at once. It toyed with us. Scratches on the walls. Whispers that sounded like our own voices. I heard Maria crying for help, hours after she was taken. I followed the sound until I saw her face in the dark‚Äîher face, not her body‚Äîstretched over something else.

The skinwalker.

It doesn‚Äôt just wear skin. It becomes it. It wore Maria like a mask made of memory. Her voice, her laughter, even the way she cocked her head when confused‚Äîit mimicked it all, but something was wrong. Too stiff. Too slow. Like watching a puppet pulled by unfamiliar strings.

Reece didn‚Äôt make it either. He tried to fight it. Grabbed a metal pole, swung like hell. I think he even hit it, but it just laughed. Laughed. Like a chorus of voices we all knew. And then it dragged him by the leg into the elevator shaft. The last thing we heard was metal clanging, and then‚Äîsilence.

That left me and Donnie.

We barricaded ourselves in the manager‚Äôs office. It had no windows, just a narrow slat of reinforced glass in the door. That‚Äôs where we watched it take shape of everyone, almost as if it were baiting us.


It walked by first as Reece. Then Maria. Then‚Ä¶ me.

It was wearing my face.

Donnie cracked. Ran out. Screamed at it to stop. It did. And then it split open, mid-step, like peeling a fruit, revealing this‚Ä¶ twitching, eyeless thing underneath. It didn‚Äôt kill Donnie quickly. I heard him die for twenty minutes.

I stayed in that office. Huddled in a corner. Watching the minute hand on the broken wall clock. Praying the alarm would sound.

And then, at 6:00 AM‚Äîit did.

The scream of sirens. The red lights faded. Sunlight pierced the skylights.

And the creature vanished.

Just like that.

Keith was waiting at the door, sipping coffee like nothing happened. When he saw me, he gave a little nod, like a man pleased with a job well done.

‚ÄúSometimes it gets bored,‚Äù he said, unlocking the door. ‚ÄúYou did good, Jasper. You made it.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak. I just walked. Out into the morning. The air never smelled so sweet. The sun never looked so bright.

I told the cops. No one believed me. The footage from that night? Gone. The other workers? ‚ÄúTransferred.‚Äù

Keith still works there.

And every year, when April comes, I hear about new hires at Sable Ridge Warehouse. Always four.

So if you work at sable ridge never accept the yearly night shift gig.

The house smelled the same. That was the first thing he noticed as he stepped over the threshold, shaking off the rain. The scent was thick and layered, a mix of old wood, dust, and something harder to define. A scent that had settled into the bones of the house long ago, absorbed into the walls, soaked into the very fibers of the floorboards. It wasn‚Äôt just the smell of abandonment. It was something more intimate, more lived-in, like the lingering presence of breath in a room long after someone had left it. It was a smell he hadn‚Äôt encountered in years, yet it clung to him now, wrapping around him like a second skin. It filled his lungs, familiar but unwelcome, like stepping into a dream he wasn‚Äôt sure he had ever truly left. It shouldn‚Äôt have been there‚Äînot after all this time. No one had lived here in years. And yet, standing in the doorway, it felt occupied.

The wind outside howled against the porch, rattling the loose screen door before dying back into a steady, rhythmic tapping of rain against the eaves. He hesitated before stepping inside, boots heavy with water, his breath fogging slightly in the cold air. The mat was still there. The same one his mother had laid out every winter, a coarse, scratchy thing that she insisted was necessary, despite how many times his father grumbled about tripping over the damn thing. He wiped his shoes on it out of habit, though the gesture felt strange, unnecessary‚Äîabsurd, even. What did it matter if he tracked mud inside? Who was here to care?
The rain had soaked through his pant legs, sending a creeping chill up his spine, settling deep into his skin. A shiver ran through him, more from unease than the cold, though he told himself otherwise. He ran a hand through his damp hair, his fingers trembling slightly before he curled them into a fist. He didn‚Äôt like how unsteady they felt.

The air inside was stale, thick with stillness, yet underneath it lurked something more elusive‚Äînot quite a scent, but a feeling, like a whisper on the edge of hearing. It reminded him of something long forgotten, something just out of reach. Like walking into a childhood bedroom and finding it exactly the same, yet fundamentally wrong, as though it had been waiting, suspended in time, for someone to return. His breath came slower now, measured, deliberate.

His fingers hesitated before reaching for the light switch, as if some part of him wasn‚Äôt entirely sure the lights would come on. He pressed it twice, the plastic cool beneath his touch, before the bulb flickered to life. The soft glow stretched the shadows thin across the wallpaper, warping the familiar patterns into something unfamiliar. The room looked normal‚Äîexactly as it should have been‚Äîbut there was something about the way the light touched the space that made him uneasy. His eyes flickered toward the brass coat rack in the corner. It was still there, standing stiff and proper, its hooks empty. He half-expected to see his father‚Äôs coat hanging there, draped over one of the arms in that haphazard way he always left it. The image formed so clearly in his mind that for a split second, he could almost see it‚Äîa phantom imprint of something long gone. But the rack was bare.

Of course it was.

His gaze traveled down the hallway, past the old console table where his mother used to toss unopened mail and unread magazines. The hallway stretched forward, leading toward the kitchen, toward the heart of the house. The air was heavier there, thicker, somehow.

A single step forward, and the floor let out a groan, the sound swallowed by the silence before it had a chance to fully exist.

It was uncanny.

Years must have passed, and yet everything looked‚Ä¶ the same. Not just preserved, but frozen. As if no time had moved at all. As if the house had been waiting.

His fingers brushed against the wooden banister, his touch light, almost hesitant, as though he were expecting it to be different. But it wasn‚Äôt. It felt exactly the same.

The varnish had worn thin in places, smoothed by years of hands gripping the railing, running along its surface out of routine. His father‚Äôs hands had done that. He could picture it now‚Äîthe quiet shuffle of slippers against the hardwood in the early morning, the way his father‚Äôs fingers wrapped around the railing for support as he descended the stairs.

The way he always paused before taking the last step, stretching out the stiffness in his legs, muttering something under his breath about getting old. The way he sighed, deep and content, as he took that first sip of coffee. The memory wrapped around him, vivid, heavy. His throat tightened, and he swallowed hard, forcing it down. This house had always been good at keeping things. Memories. Shadows.

The air grew heavier as he stepped forward, deeper into the house. The weight of silence pressed in around him‚Äînot an empty silence, but one that felt full, expectant.

He hesitated in the doorway to the kitchen. It was exactly as he had left it. That should have been comforting, but it wasn‚Äôt.

The small wooden table still sat beneath the window, its surface marked with faint scratches from years of meals and restless hands. The light above it hung low, the brass chain still slightly uneven from where his mother had pulled it one too many times. She had always tugged it absently while she talked‚Äîsmall gestures, casual, unconscious. He could still picture her standing there, her fingers twisting the chain, lost in thought as she absentmindedly stirred a cup of tea.

The window above the table was fogged with condensation, blurring the view outside, as though the house itself refused to acknowledge the passage of time. He let his eyes drift to the cabinets. They were still sturdy, though their white paint had begun to curl at the corners, a slow surrender to the years. He traced the familiar worn edges with his gaze, remembering the nights his father would lean against them, arms crossed, watching his mother cook. It was too much like it had been. The memory felt layered on top of the present‚Äîa ghost pressing against reality. He exhaled slowly, forcing himself to step inside.
The floor creaked beneath his weight, the sound too sharp in the otherwise muffled stillness. The old refrigerator hummed softly from its corner, a low and steady vibration that seemed to pulse beneath his skin. A frown tugged at his lips. Had the fridge always been this loud? The noise wasn‚Äôt comforting. It was something else‚Äîsomething unsteady, discordant.

His footsteps felt too loud as he crossed the room. He didn‚Äôt know why he was drawn to the fridge‚Äîonly that some part of him felt compelled to check. Maybe he expected to find something forgotten inside‚Äîsome relic of the past left behind, something tangible to tether him to the present.
His fingers hovered just an inch from the handle. Then‚Äîhesitation. Why was he doing this? It wasn‚Äôt like there would be anything inside. But something in him needed to know. He curled his fingers around the handle and pulled. The door swung open with a soft whoosh of air, and the bare bulb inside flickered to life.

Empty.

Nothing but vacant shelves, wiped clean of time. No milk cartons. No leftovers in Tupperware. No forgotten condiment bottles lingering in the back, their labels peeling, their contents expired.

Nothing.

A frown creased his forehead. Why? The house had felt so untouched, so perfectly preserved, as if it had been waiting for him to return. So why was the fridge empty? The absence of food shouldn‚Äôt have unsettled him, but it did. His fingers tightened around the handle. For a moment, he felt something unravel inside him, a strange fraying at the edges of his thoughts. There was something wrong with this. With all of this. The moment stretched too long, too thin.

The longer he stared into the fridge, the more it felt like it was staring back. A breath shuddered out of him, and he let the door swing shut. The sound echoed through the kitchen. And then‚Äî
A noise. Soft. Faint. His body went rigid. It was familiar. The unmistakable sound of nails clicking against the hardwood floor. His breath caught in his throat. A wave of memory surged‚Äîa flash of warm fur, a thumping tail, a presence that had once been constant.

His lips parted before he could stop himself.
‚Äú‚Ä¶Murphy?‚Äù His voice cracked, hoarse from disuse. Silence. He turned sharply, his eyes scanning the doorway, searching for movement, for shadow. His pulse hammered in his ears, a rhythm out of sync with the steady hum of the fridge. Nothing. No shape lingering at the threshold. No warm body pressing against his leg, leaning into him the way Murphy used to. His throat felt tight. His mind reached, searched, grasped. Hadn‚Äôt he just heard it? The sound had been so clear.

He exhaled sharply, forcing a weak chuckle under his breath, the sound thin, brittle.
You‚Äôre just imagining things. That had to be it.
The house was playing tricks on him. That was all.
It had been what? Fifteen years? More? Since he had stood in this kitchen, since he had last run his hands over Murphy‚Äôs thick coat and listened to that steady click of nails against the floor. 

It wasn‚Äôt the table itself that caught his attention, nor the papers that had been stacked neatly to the side, yellowed with age, their edges curling. It wasn‚Äôt even the dustless surface‚Äîa stark contrast to the rest of the house, where time had settled like a second skin. It was the box. Small, wooden, its lid slightly ajar, as if it had been left that way on purpose.

His breath slowed. He didn‚Äôt need to look inside. He already knew what was there. His feet moved before his mind could catch up, his fingers reaching, lifting the lid with slow, deliberate care. Inside‚Äî

Keys.

His throat tightened. They were the same keys his mother had always left in that exact spot. The same familiar, jingling cluster, tied together with a faded red ribbon. 

Faded. Frayed. For a moment, he just stared at them, feeling something in his stomach turn over. He had teased her about that ribbon once. 

""You keep them tied like that so you don‚Äôt lose them, huh?"" he had joked. She had just smiled in that soft, knowing way, brushing his hair back like she had when he was small.

 ""No, sweetheart,"" she had said. ""I just like knowing they‚Äôre all together. That way, I never have to wonder where they are."" His fingers curled around the edge of the box. That had been years ago. And now, after all this time‚Äî The ribbon was still there. Exactly as she had left it. His chest tightened. That wasn‚Äôt right. Everything in the house had been untouched, preserved in eerie perfection. The furniture hadn‚Äôt been moved. The dust had settled in places it shouldn‚Äôt have. But these keys‚ÄîThey should have decayed more than this. The ribbon should have disintegrated, or at the very least, loosened, threads pulling apart.
But it hadn‚Äôt. It sat there, untouched, waiting. His stomach twisted. He swallowed hard, his gaze dropping to his own hands. His palms felt too warm, a slow heat curling up his arms, like his body had registered something before his mind could fully grasp it. His mother had died years ago. His father had followed soon after. He had buried them both.  His fingers curled inward, pressing against his palms. No one had been here. No one should have been here. And yet‚Äî Nothing was out of place. Nothing was ever out of place.

His breath felt suddenly too loud in the stillness. The thought settled in his stomach, sinking deep, deep, like a weight that had always been there, waiting for him to notice it. His hand hovered over the keys, just for a second. Then, slowly, he closed the lid. The sound barely registered, muffled by the weight in his chest. He turned toward the living room.

His footsteps felt heavier now, slower, as if the silence itself was pulling at him, dragging him down.

As if the house was breathing with him.

His fingers twitched slightly as he stepped away from the wooden box, as if resisting the pull of whatever realization lurked just outside his grasp. The silence followed him.  It pressed against his back, heavy and expectant, like an unseen presence waiting for him to notice. His footsteps felt slower now, heavier. The air in the house had changed‚Äînot physically, but in the way an empty theater feels different before a play begins. As if something was about to happen. As if something was already happening.

The hallway seemed longer than it should have been. The corners stretched wider, the doorways darker, the walls subtly shifting in ways he couldn‚Äôt quite name. The living room was almost painfully familiar.

It wasn‚Äôt just the sight of it, but the feel‚Äîa space shaped by years of routine, of moments folded over each other like layered paper. Everything was exactly where it should be. And yet. Something was wrong.

His eyes swept over the room in slow increments, mapping every surface like a man searching for something just beyond his line of sight. The plaid couch still sat in the center of the room, its cushions slightly misshapen from years of use. It was the kind of couch that held memories in its fabric‚Äîmovie nights, Sunday naps, the quiet weight of exhaustion after long days.

The coffee table was still there, bearing the faint ghost-rings of forgotten coasters, the wood beneath slightly warped from years of absorbing misplaced condensation. He had once gotten in trouble for setting a glass down without a coaster, his mother chiding him with exasperation while his father just smirked over the rim of his coffee cup.

The mantel was lined with family portraits, their frames layered in dust, their glass catching just enough light to reflect back the faint shimmer of the room.

He recognized every photo. Except‚Äî His breath hitched. His eyes locked onto a single framed photograph near the fireplace. It was of him and his mother, standing on the front porch, her arm wrapped around his shoulders, both of them smiling. It should have been harmless. But something was wrong. That frame was supposed to hold a different picture. His father had always been in that photo. A slow, uneasy chill crept down his spine, his body reacting before his mind could fully process why. The change was small‚Äîinsignificant to anyone else. But he knew. This wasn‚Äôt a case of misremembering. This wasn‚Äôt a trick of the mind. His father had been in that picture. He was sure of it.

The feeling that had been pressing at the edges of his awareness since stepping into the house tightened. He stepped closer, his hands flexing at his sides, an old instinct flaring up‚Äîthe urge to confirm, to rationalize, to make sense of something that refused to be made sense of. His breath shallowed as he squinted at the edges of the frame, looking for some sign that the photo had been swapped out. There was none. His father had never been in the picture. The proof was right in front of him. But it was wrong. His breath stilled. A memory‚Äîno, more like a feeling‚Äîpressed at the edges of his mind. Something he couldn‚Äôt quite grasp. Something just out of reach.
Something he couldn‚Äôt remember. The room seemed to shift around him, the walls drawing closer, the silence deepening into something too thick to be empty The photograph burned into his vision. His mother‚Äôs arm around his shoulders. Their smiles frozen in time. His father‚Äîmissing, but he had been there. He had always been there. Hadn‚Äôt he? His breathing turned shallow, chest tight with a sensation that wasn‚Äôt quite fear‚Äîbut wasn‚Äôt far from it either. The longer he stared at the photo, the more it felt wrong. Not just the absence, but the way his mind fought to rearrange the memory‚Äîlike trying to force a puzzle piece into a space where it didn‚Äôt belong. Why couldn‚Äôt he remember it correctly?

The silence in the room thickened. It pressed against his skin, coiling around his ribs like unseen hands. His stomach lurched. A sudden, crushing sense of wrongness threatened to knock him off balance. And then‚Äî The smell. It was sudden, jarring, cutting through everything else. The house smelled the same. But not like dust. Not like emptiness. Like rain. Like damp earth and wet pavement. Like the scent of outside. Like‚Äî

Like the night he died.

The realization hit like a blow to the chest. A violent, crushing weight that sent his mind spiraling, unraveling. The past rushed in like floodwater through a broken dam. His pulse roared in his ears, his vision fracturing, splitting, like light refracting through shattered glass. And suddenly‚Äî

He was there. The road. The rain. The headlights. It was too fast. Too bright. The world tilted, twisted, folded in on itself. Tires skidding. The slick pavement beneath them, an unforgiving sheet of black glass. The steering wheel wrenched from his hands‚Äî The sharp, stomach-churning lurch of metal twisting, crumpling, crushing. Weightlessness. Then‚Äî Nothing. A void. The silence so absolute it swallowed everything. And yet‚ÄîHe felt it. The cold seeped into his skin, the rain against his face. The shattered windshield glinting with fragments of streetlight. The coppery tang of blood in his mouth. And then, most distinctly‚ÄîThe sensation of something slipping away. His grip on reality, on life itself, loosening. A breath he never got the chance to take. And then‚Äî

The house. As if he had always been here. As if he had never left. Because he never had. His stomach dropped, His breath hitched as he turned slowly, his surroundings shifting from familiar to foreign in an instant. The living room. The hallway. The house that had felt preserved, frozen, waiting. Waiting for him. He hadn‚Äôt come back. He had never left.

A sharp exhale forced its way from his lungs, his body reacting to the truth before his mind could fully catch up. Everything made sense now‚Äî The house never changing. The keys, the photo, the dustless spaces where memory had been tampered with. Murphy‚Äôs phantom footsteps. The way he had been drawn here, as if on instinct.
A noise. Soft. Subtle. A faint click-click. His breath stilled. His head turned, just slightly, toward the foyer. The door. It was open. Rain pattered against the doorstep, the cold air curling inward, brushing against his skin. Beyond it, the night stretched out, quiet and waiting. His body moved before his mind could stop it.

His steps carried him forward, through the living room, into the hall. Through the foyer. Each step felt familiar. Practiced. As if he had done this before.As if he had done this a thousand times. The rain touched his skin. Cool. Familiar. A breath left him, shallow, automatic.

He stepped over the threshold. The house smelled the same. That was the first thing he noticed as he stepped over the threshold, shaking off the rain. The scent was a blend of old wood and dust, of stale air trapped in locked rooms. A smell that shouldn‚Äôt have been there‚ÄîNot after all this time.
No one had lived here in years.

Gallery of 20 photos of Castaneda's later years...from both that webpage as well as a few additional pics, at the bottom of **this** post:

""With don Juan's permission, Castaneda began to write down his words; this is how the first of Carlos Castaneda's world-famous books was born - ""The Teachings of Don Juan. The Way of the Yaqui Indians"", published in 1968. This book instantly became a bestseller - as did his other works. All of them are records of conversations between don Juan and Castaneda, and the chain of events in them ends in 1973, when don Juan mysteriously disappeared - ""melted like fog"". Like his teacher, the writer was an extremely enigmatic and elusive figure. Castaneda carefully preserved his ""personality secret"", practically never gave interviews and categorically refused to be photographed (however, several of his photographs do exist). His biography is full of contradictory facts and discrepancies.

The word ""Castaneda"" means ""chestnut grove"", and Castaneda himself resembled a chestnut a little: a strong, but soft-spoken Latin American, 165 centimeters tall, weighing about 65-70 kilograms. Short-cropped dark hair; black, shining eyes. He always dressed conservatively, trying not to stand out in any way, regardless of whether he was wearing a dark business suit or a sports T-shirt. Carlos said that he did not smoke or drink alcohol, did not use marijuana and did not even like coffee. His only experiment with drugs was carried out at the insistence of Don Juan. According to the writer, this was his first and last acquaintance with them.

In 1973, Castaneda earned a Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of California, with a dissertation nearly identical to his third book, Journey to Ixtlan (1972). Castaneda was convinced that Don Juan had not died but had ""burned up from the inside."" But he had doubts about his own mortality. ""Because I'm an idiot, I'm sure I'm going to die,"" he told the Times. ""I'd like to be whole enough to leave this world the way he did, but there's no guarantee.""

**Cleargreen, Inc. Statement - June 22, 1998 (regarding Castaneda's death)**

""This statement is in response to numerous inquiries received by Cleargreen regarding the recent media attention given to Carlos Castaneda:

Don Juan Matus introduced his apprentice, Carlos Castaneda, to the world of knowledge of the sorcerers who lived in Mexico in ancient times. Carlos Castaneda wrote extensively about his apprenticeship with don Juan, during which don Juan taught him the way of the warrior. For don Juan, a warrior is a being who lives a life filled to the brim with exploration of the infinite possibilities of human awareness that are usually never explored; a being who embarks, when the time is right, on a defining journey of awareness.

Don Juan described it to his disciple: ""... warriors can retain their awareness, which is usually given up at the moment of death. At the moment of transition, the entire body is enveloped in knowledge. Each cell is instantly aware of itself and the integrity of the entire body."" Carlos Castaneda left this world like his teacher don Juan Matus, in full consciousness. The everyday world has no description corresponding to such a phenomenon. Therefore, according to the requirements of this world, both legal and archival, Carlos Castaneda was declared dead. Carlos Castaneda worked tirelessly, with great care, to make the world of the sorcerers of ancient Mexico and the path of the warrior accessible to anyone interested in learning about them.

Leaving this world as a lone warrior, fully conscious, Carlos Castaneda leaves behind a wealth of knowledge open to anyone willing to travel into the infinite layers of awareness that are accessible to human beings.""""

I'm a 49 yr old woman, currently 175lbs, extreme LP(a) cardiac risk factor, 

I had a gastric sleeve in 2011 and lost all the weight (180lbs) and kept it off till peri/menopause hit like a bitch last year and have slowly regained about 40 lbs, even after starting estrogen & progesterone. 

I can have a sleeve revision done because there is an out pouch that is making GERD even worse but, this is Quebec, it's a 2yr wait, unless I want to pay out of pocket (not an option $$)

I'm losing my mind at the thought of slowly regaining all the weight and becoming morbidly obese again, and the associated risk factors that would bring

My Endo has prescribed Ozempic as a way to get the weight down while I wait for the revision.

So I guess my questions are...

Any others with a sleeve that take a glp-1? Are side effects any different? 

Does anyone have any info for time/day of week that works best to minimize side effects disrupt life... Day/night, thigh, are, belly?

For those with GERD before you started, did itake it worse? I'm on Nexium, will that be able to handle any increase?

Any absolute food no-no's?

I already struggle with water, I get maybe 2 coffees and a glass of water a day... What's that going to be like?

I‚Äôve never been a pack a day person, I think at my peak there was a year where I went up to around 10 a day, but for the last year I‚Äôve tapered down to 4-8, sometimes less than that, usually closer to 8 on the weekends. As I‚Äôm sure many of you know, the cravings are worse at the bar or while driving or after a meal. I don‚Äôt care much for the nicotine (I hate zyns, vaping, lozenges, gum, etc.) I just enjoy the ritual and hand-to-mouth movement. I like having one in-between sets at a show, or with a beer on my porch. But I‚Äôm tired of getting sinus infections and having health anxiety, I‚Äôm tired of stepping out while my friends stay inside, all to the point where when I do go to smoke I can usually barely finish it. Before I tell you my plan, I want to say that going cold turkey in the past has not worked for me. I just sit and wonder when my next smoke will be, look longingly at other people smoking, and then when I break I feel immense guilt. The truth is, I know I‚Äôll have another cigarette before I die, whether it‚Äôs bumming one on vacation or having one at an outdoor metal show this summer, or after my wedding, etc. 

So here‚Äôs my plan: I will no longer be doing the timed ‚Äúritual‚Äù smoke (meaning after sex, right after eating, with coffee, regularly on breaks from work). I am going to allow myself the option of smoking up to 3 cigarettes a day during the week and 4 on the weekend, with the goal of just not smoking at all, or staying as low as possible. I will not smoke after I shower. I will not buy more than one pack within 5 days. That means that I absolutely cannot smoke more than 4 a day (20 in a pack, 5 days). I will not be smoking in the car anymore. if I‚Äôm having a beer, I can only have one cigarette per 2 beers. I also will smoke in public spaces like while walking down the street.

1jus50j,https://www.reddit.com/r/enfj/comments/1jus50j/that_second_guessing_thing_is_affecting_my/,That second guessing thing is affecting my judgment on a friend-need advice.,"So, my charge nurse at work are professional and personal friends. She‚Äôs infj. I‚Äôve been close to 3 infj who fell on the narcissistic/sociopathic spectrum (actually saw their psych testing chart not the trending use of the terms) so I was cautious about making the friendship but didn‚Äôt let it stop me from making the friend.

Recently I‚Äôm seeing an ugly side of her. She found out I‚Äôm moving this summer but id more referenced it than full detailed it before. Now I‚Äôm at the ‚ÄúI made an offer on a house‚Äù phase and she thinks I‚Äôm rushing things‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm like? Um? This is the end phase of the 1y plan which was the end of a 3y goal‚Ä¶ this isn‚Äôt rushing it‚Äôs just finally here. She‚Äôs gone as far as telling me to take my time and move into her guest room if I was worried about rent once my roommate TDYs. Wants me to put shit in storage cause she‚Äôs not moving her furniture. I‚Äôm not interested or inclined to consider and havent told her so yet because I‚Äôm making my own life choices. 

The other night at work she was in a mood and tried acting like an issue I had with another coworker waking up my paycheck patients on the unit was only because I had beef with one. First off; I told her if the one (former best friend of several years, theres no beef we just door slammed each other) AND another coworker who I don‚Äôt even interact with woke my crazies up I was letting her know now that I wasn‚Äôt gonna be running around after them. Why? Because everyone was asleep and being have until these girl from another unit came over to disturb 5rms and my charge acts like if you hear a door creek you need to jump up and find out who what why. She tried scolding me saying that I needed to get my personal out and I told her she was the one saying it was personal. I had a professional complaint. Both girls were waking my crazies. And my warning was about her not the girls. I was saying I wasn‚Äôt gonna run jump after other staff caused chaos- she can call them to deal with it was my thing. (Note if someone coded or needed bussed out or something that was a different story I just wasn‚Äôt going to babysit provoked behaviors). She dismisses me telling me to file a complaint with hr: she‚Äôs the rn sup for the shift: it‚Äôs her job not hr. The next line she‚Äôs telling me she couldn‚Äôt find the CNA or Lpn on the split hall and I was like yes because they were over here waking up _____ rooms: she gets a nasty tone ‚Äúcan I just finish one fucking sentence?!‚Äù And my CNA was like ‚Äúohhh?‚Äù In a tone that didn‚Äôt appreciate the charges tone either. I got up and went to put eyes on my people up and down the unit and let her finish her sentence to the person she apparently actually wanted to talk to. I had half a. Mind to tell her not to ever speak to me with that tone personally or professionally ever again but she‚Äôd cooled off by the time I got back. I hadn‚Äôt but I chatted and refocused my brain until I had. 

Come Monday morning after our shift I was supposed to help her with her taxes. She normally pays someone to do it and she heard me talking about my write offs and asked me. She didn‚Äôt offer to pay me and I didn‚Äôt ask her to. I was trying to walk her through the program and she was trying to hand me forms I wasn‚Äôt ready for, getting testy and impatient because she wanted to insert this form and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI will get to it. I‚Äôm working on income right now not deductions.‚Äù She wanted to read every bullet summary even if we just went through all the questions out loud and then got mad because it was the same thing (I did tell her it was the first 2 times). She got mad because I indulged her I skipping around the steps to put in the forms she wanted and the internet wasn‚Äôt loading fast enough but then if I tried going back to the tab we should be on next instead of that tabs next-it resulted in repeat questions and summaries and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúit just asked me this‚Äù. I‚Äôm like yeah that‚Äôs why I tried to skip back to where we were and why I wanted to go in order. She was like well you‚Äôre scrolling too fast and my eyes cant keep up and I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ I asked you all the questions on their page and said ‚Äúthis is a summary of what we just went through and clicked next and you wanted to go back and read it anyway and then you were mad because you just answered those: pick a lane‚Äù. She goes ‚ÄúI hope when you‚Äôre old some little smartass rushes your old eyes like this‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI hope when I‚Äôm old enough to not do my own taxes I have the patience to let the person I recruit do their task in an organized fashion especially when they‚Äôre doing it for free‚Äù. She changes the subject to her mom and prior year credits and the drama around paying for her grandsons stuff that she can‚Äôt claim and the amount of times she indicated she had illegal income or assets that I didn‚Äôt ask about just kinda gave me an ick combined with her. Behavior. 

Get done with taxes and we‚Äôre having coffee and I needed to schedule an alignment quick and she‚Äôs like this hysterical boisterous creature in the background. I‚Äôm trying to tell him my car infp and she‚Äôs trying to get loud enough in the background to tell him about our night shift and rough weekend and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúcan you be quiet for 2m I can‚Äôt hear over you echoing into my receiver‚Äù. He says something and suddenly she‚Äôs laughing like a hyena and I‚Äôm like what and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou just said you need your balls greased‚Äù and I‚Äôm like what ? He tells me I said I needed my ball joints greased and I‚Äôm like ok.. she goes ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so tired you don‚Äôt even know what you said and I‚Äôm just curious when you grew a pair?‚Äù And I snapped at her ‚Äú2016 when I had my son, hush for a minute.‚Äù And finished the call with him and let her go on in circles saying the same thing about how I was so tired I couldn‚Äôt speak and I told her I couldn‚Äôt hear myself think over her echo and him talking in my other ear. I didn‚Äôt tell her he corrected her and she was so tired she couldn‚Äôt. Hear. Because frankly I add it into her behavior the past few days and I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ are you re writing history and playing games or are you just tired? Is this week a red flag or just a bad week? I didn‚Äôt want to move in at all but seeing this kind of behavior when she thinks I‚Äôm supposed to be considering her offer wouldnt have convinced me. 


She tends to be overbearing at times and I think it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ she has nc issues with her daughter and calls her a narcissistic while talking about everything she‚Äôs done for her daughter while spelling out big purchases she spent on her that she‚Äôs going to sue her for. Part of why I was iffy about her. In the beginning is I wondered if she was trying to fill the nc daughter good with me. 


Infj have their good which is why I don‚Äôt just  dip when I find out their type but their martyr mode has always turned me off and I‚Äôm hyper sensitive to it now after a few years in therapy trying to un work ex narcs abuse. I‚Äôm having a really hard time telling the difference in the dark side of the infj vs the early signs of narc games right now and I don‚Äôt know if I want to keep this friendship or not. I am moving this summer so I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ I could just ride it out and see what developed by summer but‚Ä¶ I also don‚Äôt want bs drama as I‚Äôm trying to pack boxes. Idk. I don‚Äôt know what to do or think. I feel like I‚Äôm just taking hits and not blowing up about it which might be forgiving of human error if she‚Äôs just a sad infj but could be a dangerous move teaching her what she can get away with if she‚Äôs a narc..

So my friend (24) broke it off with me (25) January 20th after months of them not responding to my messages. This isn't uncommon for them. 

However, i was driving to get coffee for work at 6am. When I was driving I felt my phone buzz and got a sinking feeling. 

Last thing I sent to my friend was asking about their free time since my birthday was at the end of the month. This was two days prior to them texting me back. Right before that I texted them on new years wishing them a happy one and opened up to them about some things, thanking them for everything and how i felt lucky to know them. 

We've been friends since middle school. We had a rough patch in high school where they and our mutual friend distanced themselves from me. I won't lie, I was toxic back then. I was clingy, paranoid they'd leave me, just generally obnoxiously annoying. I didn't grow up with good parents so I had to do all the emotional maturity by myself. But damages were already done. 

Back then, the first time they broke it off, they left without a word. This time they let me know, bearing no ill-will and wishing me happiness. They just felt that we shouldn't be friends now or in the future? But why? Ive told them multiple times to tell me if i overstep anything.

Here's the thing about when they reached out; it was so much more in depth and heartfelt. They had realized how badly they hurt me. They were never the one to know how to handle complex and heavy emotions. So they didnt know how to set boundaries. Thus, they left me in the dust. But they didn't want to hold us to our younger selves anymore. They were truly sorry for everything. ""...maybe one day, we can start over as friends if you're inclined. No matter what, I'm wishing you the best life always.""

But to compare it to their recent...
""Hey, Rue. I wish nothing but the best for you. I hope you find happiness. I don't see a friendship now, or in the future. Please stop replying to my messages.""

This is a 2 year difference...what the fuck happened? They left me no room to ask. They just copped out. 

I need to preface this; they are not a bad person. Bad friend? Yes, but i don't know if it was only to me... 

They have so much potential to grow. If I'm in the way then I get that. But did I do something to prompt this? Is it having something to do with them? 

They introduced me to an independent coffee shop.  We used to hang out there all the time. Now, I go there every time I'm off. But there's been 2 instances where I know they saw me. But tried not to look at me. Trying to rush to get out. The second time was different. I was sketching in my sketchbook. I saw them walk in, but I averted my gaze back to my drawing. I really wanted to smile to show no hard feelings, but I didn't think they'd want me to look at them.

I had a handmade plush they gave me after they got a ribbon from a 4H contest. To my remembrance, it was to show a sign of our newfound friendship and how they are glad I'm their friend. It was sitting on the table very plainly. It started with me forgetting I packed him in there. Then I just kept bringing him for comfort. I know they saw him and me because I noticed them stiffen. They hesitated. Walking slowly towards me. Whether it was to get to the back of the line where my table was at or they just got whiplash and maybe wanted to say something idk. But either way they paced to the bathroom. They were in there for a few minutes before rushing back out. I know they wanted to get something because they looked at the menu, which is when i glanced away. So I know it had something to do with me. 

It kills me to think they may not feel okay coming into the caf√© if I'm going to be there. I hate feeling like i may be taking a safe space for them. That I ruined their day.

I saw their face through the window as they were walking away. Depsite the side profile, I saw their eyes. To anyone else it's just a neutral expression. But it's a poker face. I've seen it quite a few times before. I'm very well aware that they're bottling everything up. And it's a major blow out once they let the dam break. Yelling, crying, it's heartbreaking. They hated showing weakness to others as a kid. I guess it's no different now...

While we were still friends, they took the time to make me another plush. We would walk together in the neighborhood the caf√© is in. They gave me stuff that reminded them of me. I gave them a handmade amigurumi (crocheted doll) of their childhood favorite character. They mentioned how they don't have a plush of him nowadays. And if they did find one, it'd be one that was sold years ago and at a jacked price. So I made them that. They took a picture of him and smiled as they told me they were sending it to their friends/roommate. I had also given them an official plush Keychain of their favorite character from another series. They were smiling, but also trying not to cry.

That was the last time we hung out before they ghosted me for months. Then text me that college rejection letter of a text. Zero heart. Zero reasoning. 

I'm so conflicted... my friend was and still is the type to care very deeply. They hate feeling like they hurt someone. So, they avoid confrontation and run away, thinking it's better for both sides. Obviously not.

I know something is up. We were sending memes and ""this is you"" texts to each other before I never heard from them. They had admitted 2 years ago what they had done and reached out to me after 5 years of them ghosting me. Them initiating the possibility of us being friends again. 

I know things can change in such a short amount of time. But I know there's something they're not telling me. I've never been wrong about this kind of intuition before. They have a right to choose their circle. But don't i also have the right to closure? Would it seen weird or obsessive to ask? 

I'm writing my theoretical text in my notes app before I do it. But the thing is, I don't want to see if I'm blocked. I don't  want to risk being blocked. Or even flat out rejected before being blocked. 

But...because of that text, because of the first time we noticed each other at the caf√©, my worst  fears and trauma from previous abandonment came crashing  down on me. Old, dark thoughts resurfaced. Next thing I knew, after feeling numb and indifferent, I went through with something irreversible. I was hospitalized. Before I was admitted, I made a post with a slightly detailed caption on my Instagram of me in a hospital gown with an iv in my arm and dry hospital food on my lap. 

I didn't post it with malicious intent. It was to vent and let my followers know I'd be inactive. I was, unfortunately, still also recovering from my lack of oxygen so my thoughts were clouded. I mentioned the reason for my attempt. I even gave the acronym of my friend to apologize to them in case they ever saw the post. 

I didn't think they would as theyre dead af on there. But after I came back and cleared the built up notifications on my phone, I noticed I wasn't following them anymore, nor them following me. I also couldn't search them for a bit before I somehow  could. Guess they changed their mind on blocking me or whatever I experienced. 

That's the thing. Im not blocked anywhere else. Not even Facebook. Which brings me to my point, I have no clue if they saw my Instagram post. If they did, would I be blocked? If they didn't and they still didn't block me, then why? That's why im so conflicted on finding out if it's true for their number. 

I don't hate them. I'm hurt and super angry at them. But I still care about and love them. We held hands, yapped with each other to the point our friends had to tell us to stop. When we first met we clicked instantly. Even before this, old feelings of our past were still there, although not the same. But it was positive. So I'm also concerned. What drove them to make this decision? Why did they do this at 6 in the morning? Impulse? Trying to get it over with so they don't have to think about it? Did they regret it but are too scared to admit they were wrong for telling me the way they did? Do they think i despise them? Were they thinking i would text them back but were surprised if haven't yet? Are they conflicted about that? 

That's why I need to ask them. I want to respect their boundary so bad. But I feel so disrespected with how i was dropped so seemingly easy. Was this their conscious choice or obligation? Lack of closure is killing me and literally almost did. I'm afraid to relapse if I find out I'm blocked or if they reject me and block me. I feel weird for thinking about messaging them on Facebook messenger if I'm blocked from the beginning. 

Man I don't know...I feel like a creep for wanting to beg for closure. I feel pathetic for wanting so. 

Sorry for the rambling. I feel like if I don't overexplain then I'd get conflicted responses due to lack of information. ",2,1744155718.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1jus1hy,https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/1jus1hy/only_lasted_5_days_what_went_wrong/,Only Lasted 5 Days - What Went Wrong?,"TLDR: Instead of getting easier as the days went by, I was feeling worse and worse, losing my appetite all together, and having stomach pains - despite eating adequate calories and having plenty of extra fat on my body. Anyone know why?

So I was really excited to start OMAD, hoping it would allow me to make better nutritional and calorie choices since I would only have to ""figure out food"" once a day. 

I was also hoping it would help with energy and focus as I have ADHD (but choose not to take meds).

I wake around 5 am, and ate between 4-7pm. Bed by 830.

My normal caloric intake is around 2400 calories a day, and I'm about 50 lbs over weight. I'd like to eat around 1850 calories a day to lose 1 lb a week. 

Day 1 was difficult, and I ate out at a restaurant then bakery that evening, about 3000 calories 

Day 2 was alot easier than day 1, I cooked a balanced meal at home and ate about 2300 calories. 

Day 3 was even easier than day 2, and I struggled to consume 1900 calories that evening, I think because my stomach had shrunken down, but I considered this a good thing.  

Night 3 I woke up around 1:30 am with an upset stomach and sense that I needed to poop, but I couldn't poop, but I also couldn't sleep with an upset stomach, so I stayed awake until finally like 2 hours later I pooped and went back to bed, then over slept my alarm for the gym...

Day 4 I actually had *more* brain fog than previous days, and it was nearly impossible to be productive at all. When dinner rolled around, I had to force myself to eat - you ever get so hungry that you somehow lose your appetite? It was like that. The delicious meal I prepared didn't even taste good. I managed to get around 1600 calories in (split across 2 eating sessions), went to bed feeling nauseous and woke up again at 130 with an upset stomach for 2 hours before I finally popped

Day 5 I was *really* run down... the brain fog was totally interfering with my work day. Once again my stomach did not want food, but I ate about 1000 calories of something healthy, then 3 hours later forced myself to east 500 calories of Ramen and egg so I would have a reasonable number of calories. 

Woke up at 130, 2 hour stomach ache, shit - but this time I didn't go back to bed cuz I had an early morning zoom appointment. 

That was when I decided I needed to at least eat something small that morning, hoping I would have some energy.

At 5am I had 1 slice of bacon, and a bit of melted cheese on a wrap. That was all my stomach could handle - something small and soft. 

It did feel good to eat that, but within an an hour my stomach was queasy again. I decided I was going to start eating multiple times a day again until my stomach went back to normal. 

At 10 am I had 2.5 oz grilled shrimp, and some cucumber and cheese on an English muffin. 

Then I fell back asleep for a few hours and woke up queasy

At 4pm I had a 3 oz burger with a thin slice of pineapple of a small burger bun and a handful of sweet potato fries.

That was 45 mins ago. I still feel exhausted, my stomach is still ""off"", my face looks more bloated than it did yesterday, and I'm pretty sad that this went so poorly for me...

One more thing - I was having coffee with a little grass fed butter throught each day (under 100 calories total), so this wasn't a Real Fast, but I don't see how that could have contributed to these specific problems I encountered. 

So what gives? Why did I feel worse instead of better over time? Why did I lose my appetite all together and food started making me feel sick? Did I just quit too early? Should I try again?

A Wizards of the Coast insiste em evitar uma palavra: *edi√ß√£o*. D&D 5e continua sendo D&D 5e, dizem. Mas agora com ‚Äúmelhorias‚Äù. Com ‚Äúajustes‚Äù. Com ‚Äúqualidade de vida‚Äù. Mas n√£o chame de 5.5. E, por favor, nem pense em dizer que √© a 6e.

Os produtos se acumulam, mas o motor √© sempre o mesmo. A promessa de *Dragon Delves* √© a mesma de sempre: ‚Äúaventuras √©picas para personagens do n√≠vel 1 ao 12‚Äù. A diferen√ßa est√° no verniz. Trocar o motor? Jamais. Mas pintar os far√≥is de neon... isso sim.

*Dragon Delves* se tornou a v√°lvula de escape perfeita. Ele n√£o precisa mudar as regras. Ele muda a **sensa√ß√£o**. Ele atualiza o visual. Ele ‚Äúexperimenta‚Äù ‚Äî sem tocar no motor.

No final, √© o jogo de sempre, com cara de novo.

Com pouco mais de um minuto, o material divulgado pela Wizards of the Coast sobre DRAGON DELVES parece n√£o saber exatamente o que dizer ‚Äî ou melhor, o que **n√£o** dizer. Trata-se de uma vitrine visual, um desfile de drag√µes com estilos art√≠sticos t√£o diferentes entre si quanto as √©pocas da hist√≥ria da arte: do expressionismo dram√°tico ao tra√ßo infantiloide de um livro de colorir esquecido numa ala pedi√°trica.

Em seu cerne, *Dragon Delves* √© um projeto de colecionador. N√£o no sentido de miniaturas, mas de imagens. 

N√£o h√° um eixo narrativo, uma campanha, um mundo, um conceito maior que amarre os epis√≥dios. O la√ßo √© tem√°tico, n√£o dram√°tico. Estamos diante de uma colet√¢nea epis√≥dica, como um √°lbum de figurinhas narrativo ‚Äî bonito, mas sem enredo. O problema √© que, ao fazer isso dez vezes seguidas, corre o risco de soar como uma playlist de grandes sucessos sem coes√£o. Um *Summer Eletrohits* da Som Livre.  
  
E *Dragon Delves* deixa isso claro. Ele √© um produto que pode ser consumido **sem ser jogado**. Ele pode ser folheado como arte. Pode ser admirado como um coffee table book. Pode ser uma galeria port√°til. Ele √© jogo, mas tamb√©m √© s√≠mbolo. √â livro, mas tamb√©m √© trailer. √â arte promocional travestida de suplemento.

E isso, para o bem e para o mal, define a nova era do D&D.

No fim, esse √© o dilema da 5e: popular demais para mudar, velha demais para empolgar.  
  
*Dragon Delves* n√£o √© uma revolu√ß√£o. √â um enfeite muito bem pintado na porta de um sistema que n√£o pode mais mudar demais ‚Äî mas tamb√©m n√£o pode mais ser o mesmo.

He(30ish) is older than me(24) and I think I always found him cute but never really considered anything could happen between the two of us.

Now we dont live together anymore, but from time to time we have been writing each other briefly.

Last summer I have been back to his city and he hosted me. Actually a friend of mine was staying in what was my room and he was fine with it. And when he came home late (I was working late for an internship) he would spend even 2/3 hours talking with me until 2 am.

This is were my crush starts developing. But I cannot totally tell if he is interested or just a very nice and polite person. I would really appreciate a good friendship anyway.

This month I went back to his city and asked him out for a coffee, but he replied that he was available only after dinner.

We met at a bar and we talked from 9 pm to 1.30 am non stop. I was just missing such an wholesome type of connection. And I went back home dreaming about that night. However, we didnt flirt much.

He just showed me his hands because we were talking about gym and we have been touching hands reciprocally. But that was it. And at a certain point i was saying something like: ‚Äúyou know what tastes good?‚Äù And he said:‚Äùyou?‚Äù. But I wasnt fast enough to flirt back and he just didnt flirt with me anymore. At the end of the evening he hugged me for a little bit longer than usual and then we said goodbye.

HOWEVER, He said that he is coming this week to a city nearby for some conferences and he invited me to join him to go around and do some sightseeing. He booked an airbnb for the night and it has 1 double bed and a sofa that turns into a bed.

Whag does this mean? Is he just being nice again? Like in a very close friends way? Or should I believe he is interested in me too?

Aaaaah. I need perspectives on this!",1,1744155379.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

ƒ∞ don't know if I'm missing something or just bullshiting but i know that lonelyness is much harder than most thing because people will forget speaking after being alone enough so we need to socialize but i can't do that

1jurwty,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_6EvieJoy9/comments/1jurwty/writings_from_2018/,Writings from 2018,"When things were fresh - some of my writings from the new beginning. 

When you choose with intent,¬† it's easy to let go of the options that are now in the past. When making a decision,¬† you can make it in love,¬† say ""I choose..."", and then let go of the other options. If the situation then changes,¬† adapt,¬† enjoy,¬† love,¬† be grateful for,¬† and accept it,¬† and then... Idk. It's open.¬†Loving others the same as yourself is easy when you ask yourself,¬† ""what would I like if I were them?""

  
Do for others to support: Write a letter. Tell them in person. Give them a gift from the heart. Spend time with them. Pay attention to them. Listen to them. Encourage them. Assist them with what they ask for assistance with. Give them time and space when requested. Share all resources, knowledge, wisdom, and tools.

It's hard sometimes when friends request space, especially if either you or they are currently in a time in life perceived as ""difficult"". If you are in it, they may want to ""help"" in any way they can, and so end up having a hard time providing the space that was requested. If they are in it, it is sometimes cloudy to see through their own needs to recognize that you are taking care of your needs. Everyone is connected and one at all times. Physical distance means nothing. Words and time together are not always necessary for love, support, and encouragement. People choose what their priorities are, but choosing to spend time with yourself is not rejecting a friend, it's just choosing to prioritize your friendship with YOU and YOUR needs. If you feel that your needs will be best met in the time of space from others, that is ok. It is not ""wrong"" to choose yourself, because though we love others AS ourselves, it's SO important to remember that included in that is ""OURSELF"". We love them AS ourselves. Not MORE THAN ourselves, not LESS THAN ourselves. When they need time and space, we graciously give it. When WE need time and space, we request it in love and IN LOVE we can also stand by our boundaries as long as we desire them.¬†

...

In the end, everyone can be found in their own corners of the world or universe creating together, collaborating. One person will share an idea with someone, and they begin discussing and sharing. More people come together to discuss and share - using platforms, the ideas are shared constantly universally. Cut to a scene of an empty and abandoned white house, senate, house, banks... they look old and abandoned. Cut back to the people, taking action in their own communities. To show that nothing will get held up, that time is not a concept to care about any more or to enslave. Break the chains to clocks and money. Break the chains to bureaucracy and the resistance to change due to fear.

...

  
We don't have to villify. We don't have to pity. We don't have to fight. Welcome, encourage, engage, collaborate. Don't wait for permission. Use your own mind. We are the people, we have the power. Please join me. Can you see the world in your eyes? We need YOU. Clear away the rot. If there's no one near you to help, be the one to start helping and others will join. 

I'm not a beat poet, I'm a me poet. I say what I feel from inside. There is nothing outside that I need when all truth comes from within. Are you willing to look inside? See the vision without fear? You'll see there's never been a need to hide. See the bankers in their caves, counting money in vain, gathering the greedy to create a new reality to keep the people enslaved, I feel the world, I am the world, we are the movement, We are the new, we are the now, we are the change, I'm not a beat poet, I'm just a me poet. Watch the beast as it falls with no war won or fought. Simple turning of attention, ignoring the show to see possibility. Use my potential to create my reality. Sharing together to unite in the beauty of chaos. They will fail they say...it's good they underestimate.¬†When change happens it might just clear their cobwebs away, blow down the savage walls of fear leaving emptiness, a blank canvas of the mind. The perfect place to begin again. The world is in your eyes, you can see when you tear the walls down.¬†Feed the love, not the fear, turn your attention to action. The great deception: that you are unimportant, the biggest lie that we don't need you, Such a farce that you can't make a difference, risk to change a world you share in is a risk worth taking. Take a leap of faith, dive in and find you catch yourself. We don't have a map, we have today. Can you let go of your plan? Can you let go of your pain? Can you let go of the safety of an unremarkable life? Can you see around the blinders? Turn around, don't make plans. I make ideas and then I act. When I fall I learn and my next step is to adapt. Change is what I'm made of and where I can breathe. We adapt our technology but keep our philosophy - is something wrong? We paint new faces on old ideas - but deep inside we feel unsettled. What will they do to save us? What are they doing now? What have they done in the past? What are they continuing to do? We have the power to save ourselves. We are the people. We need you to boldly go. 

The walls come down, and they were built on magazine articles, news stories, individuals, etc... promoting fear and it's various devices. Promoting the need for more, promoting the need for consumerism, distracting from the reality of the greatness that rests in every single individual. The wall at first looks impenatrable from one perspective, but when the individual that appears to be trapped by the wall turns around, they see they were not surrounded by the wall. It is only because their eyes were locked on the wall that they missed seeing that they were never trapped. That it is and always has remained their choice. When they turn around they see that they join their drop to the multitude of the ocean of change. Include every great leader of change. Show them when they were first perceived as crazy or too much, then show their influence. Show the world in their eyes. Show them as equal to those who helped them and those they helped. Show real life clips of what people are doing in their communities and sharing freely, and inventions being made, dances, music, art... to heal the world. Then show everyone holding out their hands to the camera and the world beginning to become clearer and clearer over vision.

...

I think it's much easier to conquer a nation by dividing people, then teaching one group to fear the other while making the feared feel invisible and those who fear feel safe and secure as long as they're ""protected"" by the very one who is creating the struggle to begin with while the ones at the top are enjoying doing what they will since eyes are on the distraction they created.

...

When I'm told I can't do something... the more vehemently I'm told I can't, the more angrily I'm told I can't, and even when I'm told kindly I can't... well that just tells me I should DEFINITELY try, because I know I can at that point and that I should. How much more an impact something has that was once perceived impossible. What hope that can bring! I will always listen to the voice inside that I CAN. It's the only voice worth believing because it's the voice of SINGULAR truth. Even those with the very best intent can find themselves in the position of hindering another's potential if the other believes them when they say they can't. Encourage, speak in love, desire the best for others! Be uplifting with your words and thoughts. Do not say of someone that they can't, or that it won't work, or that they aren't doing it ""right"". What is right? Does anyone think they know everything? Does anyone think that every single thing they've ever been told is true, especially from those who benefit from the lie? Don't push the limitations you have CHOSEN for yourself on others who are seeking to improve themselves. Do not bring negative what-ifs to the conversation. There is never a need to cross bridges before you have come to them... that is only creating negative expectation, and in turn, fear of the future. Who knows the future? I intend to use my words and thoughts to uplift. I am a new person today and every day, and I choose to encourage. I choose to believe in and encourage possibility, creativity, imagination, and potential. We are all connected, encouragement for you is encouragement for me as well. I will choose love for me and you.¬†

...

Look others in the eyes. Put down what you're doing, focus on them. Give THEM your full attention. Show them they are heard.

...

There's nothing wrong with starting from scratch. In fact, it can be VERY beneficial. Start with your beliefs about everything, and then work your way out from there.

...

Put others above your fear. Love yourself and others equally. If you want to love others more, it's as easy as loving yourself more. When you see yourself in everyone, and you practice love for yourself, then you are practicing love for others. EVERYTHING is Reciprocal. Love and fear. The more you practice of one, the more you receive of it. It's as easy to change as a choice every moment which gets easier and easier the more you make that choice... as with all choices made on a regular basis, self-love, love for others, positivity, gratitude.... choices. You can choose to fear or choose to love. If you do not know what the future holds, then you do not know what your decision will yield no matter which you decide. Wouldn't you think that a choice made in love is worth anything? Wouldn't you think that giving yourself and others a chance for a good outcome is better than letting the negative ""what-ifs"" populate your thoughts? You can choose to let the positive what-ifs abound in your head if you desire, though I personally like giving my future lots of wiggle room to surprise me with much more than I have yet imagined. What if you chose to only make PRO lists and left out the CONs when you are making a decision in love for yourself and others?¬†

To practice love, we must surrender or ""let go"" of any fear we are creating as a ""what-if"". To practice love, we must always make decisions that are for the benefit of ourselves and others. To practice love, we must put others above our FEAR.

...

Is this making sense to you? Does it feel good? Does it feel like truth? Use your instinct and intuition as your guide. Don't overthink it. What does your ""gut"" tell you?

...

The LIE is ""good"" vs. ""evil"", the TRUTH is fear vs. love. It is easy to get caught up in the one because it sometimes appears to be the case based on each of our general ideas of ""good"". However, when you live in the mindset of ""good"" vs. ""evil"" then you automatically polarize yourself from the rest of humanity and all that is. Not one person has the exact same idea of ""good"" or ""evil"". Why segregate yourself? The GREAT NEWS is that there is no need to separate yourself in this way. Fear divides, but love brings us together. If you begin to re-train your mind to see everything in terms of fear or love, the TRUTH will show itself regardless of your perspective. Truth has the ability to link us all when we choose it.¬†

...

I accept my experience that I attract to myself. I attract what I want, and more than that, I attract what I don't know I want yet so that it surprises me with the magnitude and imagination to bring it about.¬†I love everything about this moment.¬†In this moment, I am living.¬†This is my experience, and I am thankful for this moment.¬†I feel calm right now.¬†My freedom, my choice in every moment to decide my experience. The article about reducing food waste in the newspaper,¬†the idea to reach out to those being educated about food waste, to expand with ""Shareourthings"". I have rest now. I have ideas now. I have opportunity now. I am using my potential now and in every moment. I am creating even now. Every moment I feel better. Every moment I AM better than the moment before. I AM and that is all that is required of me, to be.¬†To be or not to be... I choose to be because I am.¬†I choose.¬†I am the ONLY one who has control over my feelings, and I do have control of them. I can choose to feel however I want to feel in any moment. I have that ability, and it gets easier and easier to use it every moment.¬†

Creation vs. destruction. To be or not to be. To be is better than not being. They are both choices, but ""to be"" means you are creating something. It means you are a positive force. It means you are bringing something forth into the world that you want to share, whether this be a thought, a word, a feeling... whatever it is that comes to YOU. Whatever it is that only you have thought of in that way. YOUR thoughts are original. ""To be"" means sharing who you are, who you REALLY are, underneath it all, with the world. It means being the piece of the puzzle you choose to be to create the magnificent picture of the world. Very little needs to be said of ""not to be"". In the very simplest of words, it means to choose to ""not be"" something... anything. It doesn't matter what you are specifically choosing to ""not be"", it's that your focus is turned from ""to be"" to ""not to be"". Whatever you focus on is what you attract in life. So, ""to be or not to be"". I choose ""to be"" because ""I am"".¬†

Just by being a positive force, you ""infect"" that which you interact with. By radiating positivity and love, those around you can't help but adjust themselves to the new feeling you are creating. It does not matter if you are physically near those with whom you interact... this infection is invisible and travels through all means of communication - especially non-verbal communication that comes in the form of action. It's not only that you attract that which is like to what you are creating, it's that you are a catalyst for the change you feel in all that is around you. It's attracted to you and it's coming to you BECAUSE you are creating it. When you create for the purpose of loving others in whatever way that manifests for you wherever you are with whatever you have at whatever time, you are creating that which you are giving to others for yourself as well. Your world cannot help but adjust to YOU. Love conquers all fear. When YOU love, YOU conquer fear. When you CHOOSE LOVE, FEAR CANNOT EXIST.¬†¬†

Choosing to talk positively about every situation goes hand in hand with choosing to think positively about every situation. If you wouldn't say it, then don't think it either. You can create new mental habits that PHYSICALLY affect your actual brain. By simply choosing to think a positive thought in the place of a negative thought, you weaken the old habit of thinking negatively and create/strengthen a new habit of thinking positively. This is your neural network, and it can be changed simply by changing the way you think. As you progress with this exercise, it naturally becomes easier and easier until the old way of thinking literally withers out of disuse. What we experience is always what we are attracting to us out of our thoughts. 

When you choose to think positively, you have a positive experience. You WILL see opportunities you otherwise would have missed because you have changed your way of thinking about things. You no longer use fear as your tool for making decisions in a knee-jerk way, but instead you have the freedom to CHOOSE. YOU CHOOSE. You choose which thoughts to give attention to, which feelings you prefer to feel at ANY time no matter WHAT the circumstance. In CHOOSING to change, you begin to purposefully create your experience. All of this to explain the idea behind ""choosing to be happy"". It is a much quoted idea, but it's more than an idea! THE GOOD NEWS is that you have the choice right now and in every moment you experience anything.¬†

I choose to live as a skeptic and to only believe (or make agreement with) those things that would lift limitation from me. The more I learn, the more I view from my new perspective of positivity, the more I change all beliefs into limitless possibility. I will always believe that I am limitless in every way. If I can't do it yet, it only means I should practice adjusting my perspective because all things can be done. I am free because I choose to be. I am free from limitation. I can do anything and be anything I choose to be. We all have free will... absolute free will.¬†**Circumstance is the setting, not the decision.**

**...**

Just as when you talk about someone else,¬† what you think about someone or anything else is a reflection of your thoughts toward yourself?

**...**

Is every thought and every word a prayer?

**...**

When you feel like someone's watching you

And want to run and hide

Look there,¬†look deep within your heart

To see who is inside.¬†

...

Could fearlessness just be love in action 100% of the time? You have faced all of your fears so they can no longer keep you from always loving yourself and others with all of your heart. But not alone of course. You're never alone and it was not by your strength alone. A good thing to remember for humility.¬†

...

You are only as limited as you believe you are: physically,¬† mentally, emotionally. You're age doesn't matter. No matter how young you are or how old.¬† The young have just as much to teach the old.¬† If we choose to share information and ideas,¬† we can grow closer to one another and gain wisdom and understanding.¬†¬†

Today, a child told me about their 3 superpowers.¬† They can feel their hands being massaged when they hold them out and relax. They know things before they happen.¬† They imagine they are on a boat every night and can literally feel their bed rocking,¬†they say this is how they never get seasick.¬† I encouraged them in this and told them how great those were.¬† I hope they continue to believe in themself and these things they are very much experiencing and manifesting for themself.¬† I will always encourage them and everyone else to believe in the good they perceive. In the process,¬† I get to open my mind to other things that I may not have known about and can hopefully share the same with others.¬† In this way we share our perceptions in love and become complete by knowing, understanding,¬† and so loving as self every living being we try this with.¬† It's the same idea as walking a mile in someone's shoes. If you don't know someone's entire story,¬† how can you? Be open to hearing what they have to share,¬† because it comes from a different viewpoint. In this way, the more living things you understand, the more eyes you have.¬† You're able to see more,¬† the bigger picture,¬† the whole of things. Your way becomes more illuminated, and in the process you illuminate the way for others.¬† Together,¬† whole and complete we will proceed. Always learning and growing in love.

...

Do unto yourself as you would do unto others.¬†Think of yourself as you allow yourself to think of others.¬† For example,¬† you are thinking of anything when you think to yourself ""what a dumb thought,¬† I'm an idiot"". Would you ever say that to anyone else? Don't say it to yourself.¬† Instead, talk to yourself as you would talk to others.¬†If your friend comes to you with a challenge they are facing,¬† you don't tell them it's impossible or they'll never figure it out.¬† You tell them they can do it and to keep trying.¬† Do the same for yourself.¬† Give yourself the same advice you give others.¬† Listen to yourself. Love yourself and care for yourself,¬† just as you do others.¬†

...

I finally get ""your will be done"". Make a decision based on what you want, decide to work toward it in that moment and every moment you're in,¬† then acknowledge that you have no control over it beyond that and that if you feel led differently at any point,¬† you will go where you're led.¬†

...

Embarrassment is a fear of not being perfect.¬† It follows that you are striving for perfection if you get embarrassed.¬† Fear of failure just shows you what you want if you look at what you're most afraid of failing at.¬† What do you feel worst about in your life? Like you're ""failing"". It's at the things you most value. So instead of focusing on the negative feeling of fear,¬† now you can focus on what you actually value because now it's visible to you.¬†

...

I read something today that said that a thought is not who you are. What a powerful statement. I have found in the past that I feel like a failure for thinking horrible thoughts. They come unbidden. I've spent some months working on changing my thoughts, and when they jump FIRST to negativity it hurts. It hurts when I don't catch it immediately as well... I feel like I'm going back to square one or forgetting... I read that you can't go back to sleep after you've woken up though, so I am comforted. I want to think of the positive first. I want to think in a healthy way. I wonder if the struggle ever ends or if thinking of it as a struggle is part of the problem...solution? I want to break the cycle. I want to be the ONE - in whatever capacity that means. What does it mean to embrace the dark with the light? Where are the bad thoughts coming from? Do they come from me or from another? Is someone purposefully trying to sabotage me or is someone just trying to make me stronger? I noticed that when I was so scared of my thoughts when I first waking up, I came out of that nearly fearless of death and nearly fearless of ""scary things"". I can watch the most terrifying movie now (something I would never have done before I woke up) and see hope, positivity, and the symbolism that teaches. So what am I learning from these thoughts? Maybe I am becoming stronger, even more fearless, and ultimately prepared for what I am to do. That has a ring of truth. I'm going to keep listening.¬†

...

You will always be believed with ease if you are always honest with yourself and others.¬† Then you also have an enormous responsibility to never purposefully mislead.¬†

...

Always try to see that nothing goes ""wrong"". Events occur. If you are trying and hoping for what you want in life, they will occur exactly as they should. If there is something that appears to be a ""mishap"", there is probably something that can be learned from it. Being nervous when in situations with others could be a fear of looking silly or stupid. If you decide that it's ok to look silly or stupid at any given time, then you will be able to focus more clearly on that which is important to you instead of your nerves. Accept that if something goes ""wrong"", it actually went very right and there is a big reason for it. Look for that reason! Was it to make others laugh at you, put them at ease, see that you are human exactly like them, learn from you brushing it off and accepting it with grace? What about changing your opinion? You can apply this here as well. Did you use to believe something, even yesterday, even a moment ago that you no longer believe? Have you ""flip-flopped""? Have you changed who you are? Maybe you have changed who you are and maybe you HAVE flip-flopped, but why should you not? Why should anyone ever resist changing their opinion or changing themselves? If you accept that you do not know everything (and that includes whether or not you are ""right"" in any situation), then you cannot choose to keep your mind unchanged because you do not allow your ego to build on top of always-held or even newly-held beliefs thus opening your mind and heart to others opinions and ideas.

It is much easier to tame an ego that has no foothold than to destroy all that the ego is built on. Ego should sit on sand.

I like to see my ego as a massive King Cobra! I am there in my mind with my King Cobra... I usually sit beside my Cobra so that I can keep close watch... he likes to slither up to the controls and mess with the buttons even though he doesn't know how things work and ends up mashing everything and causing a mess. He's pretty much like a baby in that way! Every now and then when I get a twinge in the back of my throat or above my heart that feels ""off"" or wrong, I know that I need to look at my Cobra to see what he is up to. One day I was reading about some good things that someone was doing in the world, and I felt a twinge. I wondered why reading about good things made me feel bad in ANY way and discovered my Cobra at the controls furiously trying to make me believe that I was too late to the party and my dream of being a part of making the world a better place was slipping out of my hands because someone else already knew and was already doing it. My Cobra was trying to tell me that I had to be the FIRST one, the BEST one, the one to receive ALL recognition. I then took the time to see if My Cobra's viewpoint aligned with my values and of course they didn't. I know who I want to be every moment, and in that moment I knew I wanted to be someone who wants above all to see the good in the world and the love spreading through everyone. I knew I wanted everyone to reach their full potential which is to say, they are doing what they love while loving and helping others and bettering our society family. My Cobra has a hard time believing me when I tell him that there is plenty of love and recognition for him as well and that he will always have everything he needs. Then I look at my Cobra lovingly, feed it a snake snack, and play it a lullaby on my snake charming instrument so that it will sleep peacefully and happily. Then I rest beside my sleeping Cobra in his basket and pet my beautiful Siberian Tiger, who is on my other side, always steady and strong and full of latent power.¬†

You never have to worry about making a fool of yourself if you are always willing to adjust your perspective, laugh at yourself, and move on. If you look closely at those things that give you ""nerves"" when involving other people, ask yourself why you are nervous. Is it because you think something could go wrong?¬†

Always let hope make your decisions for you.¬†

Anything and everything you ever create or even SAY has truth! You may not realize it, but you already know the truth. Listen to yourself.

I wonder if long ago, we knew how to pilot the earth. I wonder if we were headed somewhere. I wonder if once we set course and put it on autopilot, people started forgetting because it was so far away. Are we traveling toward lights? Are the sun and moon our guides? A star somewhere else? Now everyone has forgotten and we're almost there. We have to come together now so that when we arrive, we are the travelers that another civilization would love to meet and grown/learn with. We can only do this by coming together. Maybe when we do come together, we'll remember....?

...

When you get discouraged, always remember, love is infinitely more powerful than hate. Your dreams are more powerful than anything could negate. No one by saying or doing anything can stop your dreams from becoming. You are the only person who could do that, and just by daring to dream you have started a snowball that will only grow. You have added your light to the fire. Once you add a burning stick to a bonfire, do you think you can pull it out? Who can? You cannot! You can't even get close enough to pull it out! Those who hate the truth might try to throw water on your stick, but they would have to put out the entire bonfire to put out YOUR stick. Every single person can and does help the balance. All the water in the universe could not put out the sun. Our bonfire is the sun.¬†

Who can be told the meaning of life? How can anyone convey the concept? I first believed because I started searching for answers, but something called me to search. Something calls everyone to search. If you search, you're going to find what you're looking for. I can tell people that. I can tell people everything I have learned... but I wonder. Will they learn from the words, from their soul song, both? Will the words help them hear? Something helped me hear. I was searching and that movie, the Secret, helped me hear the only part I needed to start my journey. Then I was given an option, continue or ignore? It was like the Matrix. If you choose the red pill, you can never go back. I leaped for that red pill. I will never go back!

...

All that is being said is what has already been said, differently.... from my little view point. My contribution. My piece of the puzzle is the song I sing. My piece is this.

...

It's so important to treat others as yourself because everyone is you and you are everyone. Everyone just is. We have different experiences on this planet which is the only thing that makes us different, a good different. This is a unique different that enhances us. It is a way of growing. Imagine one giant person who has decided to make themselves into millions of people. This giant person can't possibly remember everything they know in their giant body in millions of small bodies. That's too much information. How could one experience anything different if everyone knows everything? So what if everyone is given a song in their heart... a way to remember there's more and a way to keep them just awake enough to be living. Is the song their soul? Is the song what connects them to one another? It is. It is the heart beat of everything. We are separate for now, but we are one. How can you remove from existence or harm or deter or belittle or ignore a part of you? Every part of you is important! Every part of you has a purpose. To move forward, all parts of the body must work together. We must all come together. We are. When one candle is lit, it lights those around it until the whole world shines.¬†

...

When you discover the meaning and purpose of life, you discover that you still don't really know it. You discover that there's more than you thought could be imagined. You discover that you are not in control. The more you learn, you continually realize that you are still at the beginning of knowledge. You realize that we all know as much as everyone else, we just know different pieces. If you work together, you put more and more together. To make your knowledge complete, join with others in telling the story. You'll never get to the end alone, no one will. Everyone will arrive together, healed and whole and ready for the next adventure.¬†

...

IMAGINE that everything is a symbol made specifically for you to lead you to your destiny. Your epic journey. The meaning of life. The meaning of YOUR life. Earthly mysteries are all solved, and now you are left only with those spiritual mysteries that will be solved in their own time on your journey. You can't make the journey speed up, but neither can you make it slow down or stop. You can only be aware of it and open to learning what you can from each moment.

...

Don't take yourself or anything too seriously. If you make a mistake (as you will) your ego will be much harder to calm if you believe you're serious and important. If someone misses the point, there's no need to validate your words. Let them believe and see from the point they are at right now. You do not know the full meaning of your own words! Can you see every perspective? If you can't, imagine that someone is seeing another piece of the truth, and listen rather than get defensive. They did not miss the point, they saw another one.

**...**

There is nothing that is ""right"" or ""wrong"". There is no ""correct"". I there is something that you don't agree with, then change your perspective to see the truth inside it.¬†

**...**

You can be inspired by your own thoughts because your conscious mind may not in fact be the author of those thoughts. You can read your thoughts over and over again enjoying them, reveling in their brilliance and rejoicing in their truth. You can believe your thoughts just as thoroughly and fully as you can believe the quotes of great minds. This is because you know that everyone has this capability. Another's thoughts may look different or be laid out differently, be in a different language, or seem silly/incoherent... but if you change your perspective, you can always find the truth and the beauty. You can enjoy everyone's thoughts. You can find the good in it all. Thinking well of yourself and your thoughts is not wrong. It is not conceit, but gratitude.¬†

**...**

Because everyone else is brilliant, does not make me less brilliant. I am brilliant differently than anything else in the entire universe. There is only one me that sees exactly how I see. I can share ideas with someone and learn new thoughts and see a new perspective that I could not have come up with on my own since I see in my own unique way. Together WE can put together the pieces of our thoughts and experiences to form a whole story and map of who we are and what we're meant to be/do. It is the purpose of life.¬†

I am brilliant AND so is everyone else.

Whatever I'm doing in any given moment is exactly what I should be doing. There can never be any fear of missing out when I know with all assurance that there is nowhere else I should be because then it wouldn't be my story anymore if it wasn't exactly where I was in that very moment! Knowing this, there can never be dissatisfaction in traffic...standing in line...going to work...waiting for ANYTHING, because there is purpose and reason in EVERY moment.¬†

...

Today I'm feeling... a little tired, physically and emotionally... mainly emotionally in the sense that I feel the need for extended completely alone time. Though... thinking of that, it would probably just be nice to get a few weeks with no obligations except to my immediate family. My circle is expanding and I believe it's going to expand exponentially over the years, and yet I still enjoy my alone time and feel as though it is necessary. When can I find time for me? I like little hours here and there, they're delicious treats... and I would also like a longer vacation. I would like a week with husband somewhere soon...¬†

That is main feeling that I have right now. I'm happy, expectant, and content. I feel as though everything is as it should be. My desire as always is for the box. Maybe I'll find I don't need alone time, or maybe I will always have enough and feel that I have enough. Either way is perfect! I love alone time so much but I know my heart can change if my soul desires it. Right now? Some warmth, so I'm going to make myself some coffee and then get back to work.¬†

Maybe I do feel something more. I am waiting so expectantly to talk with my inner self... plainly. To put away allegory and symbolism briefly, perhaps, and talk. What would I even say? Would I have questions? I feel like me saying anything or asking anything is unnecessary though. I've been thinking enough - I just want to listen. So I know we will. I don't know how or when, but I know we will and I am content with that.¬†

When you said ""I have everything I need"" before, you thought you were ONLY saying you had everything in the physical world that you need... but you were ALSO saying that you have everything you need in EVERY way.

More ideas from more minds creates something that you could not create on your own that you are wanting. So WANT. Talk about what you want, think about it, share it... it will be molded and shaped.¬†

...

Keep talking about your dreams, invite others to join in talking and presenting their ideas, take their ideas and use them allowing the entire creation to be theirs if they want it... knowing that it doesn't matter who OWNS it, what matters is that what you are wanting to create will be created. Together is easier and increases joy.¬†

...

Launch your creations TOGETHER. Enjoy TOGETHER. Communicate and invite to join in the creating process to increase their joy.¬†

...

Floating in space. Thinking you're alone. The horrifying thoughts could last for a long time... but when you finally get silent, as you must... you realize you are not alone. The joy of that experience makes the struggle a part of it. The struggle then becomes Joy. Once you can always SEE the struggle as joy, when can you not be joyful?¬†

...

How to Win. A story about a journey to learning how to be happy, then what follows is an epic and beautiful adventure. Scary at times, but beautiful the entire time.¬†

...

Maybe we are all angels - able to be exactly what someone needs at any given time - if we just let go of our control and let our inner being work through us. They are omnipotent and omniscient. We may not know ""how to"" help, or reach any goal (our own or others), but if we believe that every word is truth then we can open the portal even wider and understand more of what we are saying when we allow the other to take that control.¬†

Free will is the ability to make whatever choice you want. Freedom is the knowledge that it doesn't matter what choice you make, you will achieve your ""fate"" or ""destiny"" regardless. You will find what you are actively seeking.¬†

There are no wrong choices. There never have been, and there never will be.¬†You have free will to decide which path you want to take at any given moment, and in that path, whatever you chose, you will find what you are seeking because it has already found you and is just asking you to listen. Free will is the ability to make whatever choice you want.¬†Could you miss out on your destiny (the thing which the ""other"" is guiding you toward) if you don't listen? Can you possibly choose not to listen? When you are called can you ever go back? I don't believe you can go back, but I don't know if you can make a decision to stay deaf...

My husband‚Äôs birthday just passed, and I reaaaally wanted to get him a new coffee machine (he was using a free De‚ÄôLonghi one that he got some years ago second hand I think), so I got him the Barista Touch Impress. 

They didn‚Äôt have a dark coloured option where I‚Äôm at (in Singapore) and so I sourced the olive one from the US, but didn‚Äôt realise that there was a difference in wattage / voltage! 

It‚Äôs been a huge bummer. And a very expensive one, considering the shipping and USD to Singapore Dollar. 

It is still BRAND NEW and in the box. We noticed the wire and our hearts broke! 

Anyone here has had any experience using a step down transformer for your Brevilles? 

The machine is 110v / 2000w. 
In Singapore the voltage is 240v. 

I‚Äôve heard that I could get a 3000w step down transformer, but that the 60hz (Singapore) vs 50hz (US) phase might be an issue too. 

Should I even be considering using this transformer as an option?

1jurtgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jurtgw/aitah_for_making_a_judgy_comment_to_my_female/,AITAH for making a judgy comment to my female friend,"This happened a few months ago. I (M25) quickly developed an intense friendship with a coworker (F24). We‚Äôll call her Valerie. We became functionally each other‚Äôs closest friends within 7-10 days of meeting each other. I say functionally because my actual closest friend lives in a different city and I don‚Äôt hang out with him that much in person. 

Initially, I thought she was attracted to me because I would catch her looking at me throughout the day even before we hit it off. I was definitely attracted to her. She was physically my type, liked to banter, and intelligent although in a different way than I consider myself to be intelligent. Without giving away too much detail, she is very open about surface level details of her life. She would share things that happened to her that most people wouldn‚Äôt that quick. This was appealing to me who is often a little closed off and emotionally unavailable. I‚Äôm a friendly, sociable guy but not much for sharing. The last important thing to note is that neither of us really have friends in the city being new to the area.

It‚Äôs important to note that I lack what I would call romantic confidence. I have no issue talking to women but often friendzone myself out of fear of rejection. We start by going over to each other‚Äôs desk constantly throughout the workday. I ask her for her number. She gives it to me. We start texting each other throughout the day. We hang out a few times outside of a work over the next few weeks. Things that are not necessarily dates but could be easily perceived as dates. She‚Äôd call me on her way home from work because our commutes were in different directions. These are not short calls and they would range from 20 minutes to an hour most of the time. We spoke on the phone nearly every day for 3 weeks. We became so attached at the hip that a lot of our coworkers assumed we were dating. We were certainly not. She made it very clear that she didn‚Äôt want to date anyone from work. This was fine with me even though I had developed strong feelings towards her based on surface levels traits that I find very attractive. As I got to know her better, it also became clear that while we made for good friends, we weren‚Äôt really looking for the same things in a relationship. 

Flash forward to the incident that inspired this post. On Fridays, a group of people go to a bar close to the office and have a few drinks before either going home or hitting the rest of the nightlife scene in our city. This particular Friday, I didn‚Äôt go because I was having dinner with my family close to where the nightlife scene in our city is. I texted her to tell her to let me know if they go anywhere after, so I might meet them. 

I have dinner with my family and it goes longer than I expected and I didn‚Äôt hear anything from her, so I figured everyone just went home after the initial drinks. As I‚Äôm getting in my car to go home, she calls me and tells me that the happy hour drinks were a little more rowdy than usual and she‚Äôs driving two of our other coworkers to a bar near me. I can hear them in the background and they are clearly drunk. Well call them Jason and Tommy. For some reason, she is driving Tommy‚Äôs car and not her own. Anyways, I say cool, I‚Äôll meet y‚Äôall out. She asks me if she can stay at my place because I live close to the bars. I say of course, no problem. She ends the call with an I love you which made a little uncomfortable but also felt good. I wanted to change so I go home and do that. By the time I get back they are already there with a fair amount of my other coworkers and it is pretty drunk group with Jason and Tommy leading the way. They were already barely coherent when I walked in and continued to drink. I see this and think I should have a couple drinks max because I‚Äôm probably going to have to drive some people and will definitely have to drive Valerie even though she is also staying sober. 

Jason and Valerie are flirting and must have been flirting at the original bar. I‚Äôll admit this angered me. For a few reasons: I was attracted to Valerie, Jason is both of our supervisors, and he is barely coherent and only getting less so. At this bar, I say hi to everyone, grab a drink, and start talking to one of my coworkers who is now a friend but at this point was more of a friendly acquaintance. Frankly, this group of coworkers was not really my friend group in the office. I‚Äôm really not having a good time as I have to watch her flirt with a drunk forming less and less sentences that pass as English. He is also starting to lose the ability to stand up on his own. When not flirting with him, she is coming up to talk to me. After about an hour, I‚Äôm ready to go. She‚Äôs not drinking either. I‚Äôm like hinting at wanting to leave, but the rest of the group wants to go to a third bar. 

At this point, I probably should have told her to find another place to sleep tonight because I‚Äôm in a bad mood and there‚Äôs no way this ends well. I in fact did not do that and instead drove a bunch of people to the next bar where of course Valerie insisted on sitting in Jason‚Äôs lap in my car. At the third bar, I sit off to the side being sober and not wanting to engage with the drinks. I‚Äôll admit I was sulking. Maybe 30 minutes pass and Valerie comes up to me and says we gotta go. Jason just got kicked out. Can you grab Tommy? I grab Tommy and Jason‚Äôs outside yelling as Valerie is trying to get him away from the bar. I have to gently move him towards where I parked because I‚Äôm going to drop the 3 of them off at Tommy‚Äôs car and follow them to Tommy‚Äôs to pick up Valerie after she drops them off. 

Tommy is a slow walker and we‚Äôre walking 50 ft behind Jason and Valerie so they make it to my car first. He‚Äôs blackout drunk. She is sober. As she‚Äôs herding him into my car, they kiss and get in my backseat. Tommy and I get to the car and I drive them to Tommy‚Äôs car. Valerie and Jason get out. Valerie says ‚ÄúHow about you take Tommy and I‚Äôll take Jason home?‚Äù I respond ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Tommy‚Äôs car.‚Äù Jason then insists that Tommy rides with them. So I follow them home, and frankly I‚Äôm furious. I tell myself I‚Äôm not going to bring it up. As soon as she gets in my car, she says ‚ÄúI hope Jason is going to be okay.‚Äù I say curtly ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù I‚Äôm doing my best to hide my emotions but it‚Äôs clear I‚Äôm not happy and haven‚Äôt been thrilled for a few hours. She keeps bringing up how‚Äôs she‚Äôs worried about Jason. I can‚Äôt keep it in. 

Me-‚ÄúMaybe you should just leave him alone. He‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù
Valerie-‚ÄúI‚Äôm just worried that he‚Äôs gonna try to drive. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have left him.‚Äù
Me-‚ÄúWell, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have been making out with a guy who can barely speak or stand.‚Äù

Safe to say she lost it. Demanded that I take her to her car (which was not close to where we were, a lot farther than my place and well out of my way.) I instantly regretted saying anything and immediately apologized. After haranguing for caring about what she does or doesn‚Äôt do and telling me how disrespectful my comment was I‚Äôm apologizing and she shuts down. I‚Äôm pleading with her to talk with me and she is shutting me down the entire drive. We get to her car and she has not calmed down at all. 

I was devastated the next day and tried to call her and apologize again. I text her and apologize. No response. On Sunday, she finally responds. Still mad, she is concerned about my feelings for her and asks for space. We still are friends and talk a little at work but our relationship is decent for the next 10 days or so. We never really get to talk about what happened because I had said my apology and was waiting to see how she felt with some space between it. 

10 days post incident, I ask her if she wants to walk over to the coffeeshop near us and get some coffee which we did most days prior to this. She says no. No problem. I go back to my desk and she gets up and looks at me and smiles and leaves. Comes back in the office with coffee. I thought she was just fucking with me, so I text her jokingly ‚ÄúDamn you went without me.‚Äù She responds and says that I shouldn‚Äôt worry about what she does so much and she can do what she wants and she doesn‚Äôt want to hear about it from me. I just didn‚Äôt respond to this and for the next two months or so she doesn‚Äôt speak to me. Goes out of her way to ignore me and talk to people close to where I sit who are my friends. During this time period, I also catch her looking at me throughout the day again. There‚Äôs some more epilogue to this story but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs relevant to my question. I‚Äôve been upset about this for a while. She is aware of this but I‚Äôm not sure she understands that I‚Äôm upset that she‚Äôs cut me off as a friend without really talking about it and not that I‚Äôm upset that she‚Äôs not interested in me romantically. 

I‚Äôve talked to two of my close friends about it and they are on my side. But they‚Äôre my friends and don‚Äôt know her so I‚Äôm asking Reddit AITAH?

TLDR: I (M25) formed a very intense friendship with my coworker Valerie (F24) within a week of meeting. Despite my attraction to her, she clearly stated she didn't date coworkers. One Friday, after I offered her a place to stay after a work bar outing, I met up with her and a group to find her heavily flirting with our drunk supervisor, Jason. Later, in my car, they kissed. My frustration boiled over, and I made a sarcastic comment about her making out with someone barely conscious. She blew up, demanded I take her to her car, and has since given me the cold shoulder at work, leaving me upset about the loss of our close friendship.

My friends say I'm not the AH, but I'm wondering if I crossed a line by commenting on her behavior, even though it felt disrespectful given our close bond and her earlier statements about dating coworkers. I'm more upset about losing her as a friend than the romantic rejection, but I can't help feeling like she overreacted to my admittedly snarky comment. AITA for being upset about how she handled the situation and the subsequent silent treatment?

I've slowly had symptoms of muscle tightness and neck and body twitching increase gradually since I got the two part moderna mRna vaccines back in Spring of 2021. I was male 23.5 at the time. Within the past two years it's been harder to ignore or brush off so I've seen multiple movement disorder specialists. 

The most annoying symptom is having half my head feel tight with is pulling in my head, jaw, and neck and it continues further below. 

At the time I thought it was Dyskinesia symptoms when it occured to me later on that it could have been the vaccine. The best the movement specialists have come up to treat it are injections of botox every three months and I've been on 40mg of Ingrezza about to go to 80mg. I figure if some benefit occurs this would point to a transmitter issue, but now I'm doubting that's the case.

I'm trying to understand the spike protein theories going around. Doesn't the body lower and filter the amount of spike protein naturally over time? Having been almost four years since vaccination, what spike protein is left to be detoxed? Also, are there any theories as to why my symptoms would have increased over time rather than peaking initially?

I‚Äôve been working on something close to my heart ‚Äî a set of lyrics that tell the story of how my hometown has changed over the years. I‚Äôd love to turn this into a full country song, but I could use some help bringing it to life with a melody and maybe even some music.



If you or someone you know is a country artist, songwriter, or musician who‚Äôd be down to collaborate, please reach out! Let‚Äôs make something real and heartfelt together.



Here are the lyrics:



üé∂ The Hometown I Knew

Written by Matthew Lashway ‚Äì Country Song Version



\[Verse 1\]

I came back home to fields so wide,

Where peace and pride used to ride.

Mornin‚Äô meant that mama's cookin'

Sausage, gravy, biscuits good lookin‚Äô.



We‚Äôd laugh out back past county signs,

Telling stories 'neath the pines.

Folks waved from their front porch swings,

You‚Äôd hear the church bell ring.



\[Chorus\]

But the hometown I knew, it ain‚Äôt the same,

The streets are cracked, and folks don‚Äôt wave.

The diner‚Äôs gone, and dreams run dry,

And the stars don‚Äôt shine the same at night.

I came for love, I stayed for blood,

Now I drown in hometown mud.

Still rollin‚Äô on with nothin' new,

Just missin‚Äô the hometown I knew.



\[Verse 2\]

The Kmart's dead, the lot half-filled,

That hopeful hum is long since stilled.

Tim Hortons stands where dreams once grew,

The past replaced by something new.



The hotel leans, paint‚Äôs chippin‚Äô slow,

Like time forgot where it should go.

Kids don't walk, they look around,

Scared to set a foot down.



\[Chorus\]

Yeah, the hometown I knew, it ain‚Äôt the same,

The laughter‚Äôs lost, the joy's been drained.

No sidewalks safe, no peace at night,

Just shadows under broken light.

I came for love, I stayed for blood,

Now I drown in hometown mud.

Still rollin‚Äô on with nothin' new,

Just missin‚Äô the hometown I knew.



\[Bridge\]

Now it‚Äôs fields or prison walls,

Ain‚Äôt no dreamin' in these halls.

Truth gets twisted, rumors fly,

And old hope just waves goodbye.



\[Verse 3\]

The porch lights flicker down the street,

The echo‚Äôs gone beneath my feet.

Time moved on, but I stayed still,

Wishin‚Äô on a windowsill.



\[Final Chorus\]

Yeah, the hometown I knew, it‚Äôs all but gone,

But in my heart, it still lives on.

I sip my coffee, black and strong,

And hum the tune of an old front lawn.

I came for love, I stayed for blood,

Now I drown in hometown mud.

Still rollin‚Äô proud, though it‚Äôs not new,

Holdin‚Äô tight to the hometown I knew.



\[Outro\]

So I guess I‚Äôll sit and grieve awhile...

Even though I roll with style.

1jurnvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1jurnvv/venting_dumped_by_my_date/,Venting: dumped by my date,"TLDR: was dumped by him two weeks after the first date, right after that found him on Grindr and stuff. 

(Before anything, English is not my first language, and I apologize for possible mistakes or confusion I may make)

So I met a very cute guy on Bumble. I claimed that he was super busy those weeks so I kept in contact with him, basically chatting with me on the app for 3 weeks, and we had our date. 

The date went pretty well. We chatted and laughed a lot, nearly nonstop. I thought we really had a connection and we liked each other. After eating at the restaurant, he proposed to grab a coffee and to go to a comic store that he was interested in. I was 100% glad to accompany him. And I really enjoyed this whole journey, walking from the restaurant down the city for about half an hour, wandering in the store, having a great conversation all the way. This experience was a 10. 

At the end of the date, I took out a little gift, a snack for him cuz I missed his birthday when he was at his busy period. I said I hoped I could be his next one. He said him too. And he gave me several pecks on my lips. He even held his umbrella between his two legs, which made me feel that he was so cute, and gave a big hug. I had a crush on him. He also proposed to cook for me and Netflix and chill at his home before I said anything. I was on cloud nine. 

But then, things went wrong somehow. Before the second date, we‚Äôd been talking about random things and also details about the date. He asked if I had allergies or something I didn‚Äôt like. Everything was planned so well. Until that day of the date, literally 4 hours before it, he canceled the date, saying he got too much work to do before the close of the month. What else could I say? I was pissed, somewhat, but I said beautiful words to him and gave him the maximum patience. But as 2 days passed, we talked like usual on phone, greeting each other, and he told me that the night before he went out to a party with his friends. I mean wasn‚Äôt he so busy and so sorry about putting off the date so he just went out with his friends?

Another week passed without seeing him. This time, he claimed that on Sunday he got a friend coming from Madrid (we are in Barcelona), so this weekend he couldn‚Äôt manage a date. But I mean what about Friday and Saturday? He didn‚Äôt say anything about other possibilities? Fine, always maximum patience then. And at this weekend, he told me that well on Friday night he hung out till so late and woke up so late on Saturday and he was on his way to his friends home blah blah. Well, I could only say and said to him enjoy it as much as you can. But I was so speechless. 

Three days passed without that he responded to my last text and it was Tuesday yesterday. I greeted him in the morning but he didn‚Äôt respond as expected. I felt so tired with the interaction between us. He‚Äôs surrounded either by work or by friends. I‚Äôve never had the priority in his mind. During this whole month, I‚Äôd been suffering so much from anxiety and pressure, partially due to my personality as well. So yesterday I was kind of prepared to get over him, not to text him any more. But at night, he sent me a voice message saying that he‚Äôs not interested in meeting with me anymore. Like I don‚Äôt have to worry about it any more cuz it ends so horribly. It‚Äôs destroying my feelings. But in the meantime I feel so numb since I‚Äôve been failing to date with people in general so many times. 

What stroke me most is that later I tried to check Grindr and Scruff cuz I felt suspicious somehow and I did find him there. What‚Äôs more, both apps said that he was online half an hour ago. That was more or less the time I sent the last farewell text to him ‚Äútake care‚Äù. I mean he always said that he had so much work and he got so many events with friends and now he‚Äôs looking for someone else on Grindr and Scruff!!! On seeing that, I just felt so disgusted, with that look that I admired so much and that fact that he was looking for hookups as well. I feel like I‚Äôm a clown, all these day waiting for him while he possibly was looking for great fun with others!

I feel so helpless. I thought I finally met someone that had enough motivation and passion to continue with our things even though he was being very busy this whole time. I had given the most patience I could give cuz I would have been fed up very quickly if someone didn‚Äôt want to meet in one or two weeks. 

Well, I just needed to vent a bit. Gotta work tomorrow but it‚Äôs almost 1:30. May all of us find love, including me please. Thanks for your attention, guys. ",3,1744154619.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

My sleep improved as well as less daytime fatigue.   My numbers really didn't budge though (I have thyroid nodules), so my dr says I didn't seem to be ""converting"" and added 5 mcg of liothyronine at the end of February.   At this same time, I am under an enormous amount of stress (death in the family, selling a house, pipe burst and subsequent repairs, and financial woes).  I started out taking the lio at the same time as the levo but started waking at 4 am most nights.  I've experimented with taking the lio first thing in the morning instead, but sometimes I forget and start drinking my coffee too soon after.  I still wake a lot in the middle of the night, but not every night now.  I've also started having random, sudden, nearly uncontrollable boughts of diarrhea around once a week.  I read this could be a side effect of thyroid meds and it takes a few weeks for the body to become accustomed to the lio.  It's been about 6 weeks though.  Do you think this could be from the meds even though it's not daily?  Is there another way to take it to mitigate side effects?  Or do you think the sleep and bathroom issues are more likely stress-related?  I thought of going off the lio for a bit, but I really don't want to because I finally feel like I'm making headway with my weight loss again.",1,1744154562.0,Hypothyroidism,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôd really appreciate some input from women on this situation‚Ä¶

There‚Äôs a woman who lives in the apartment across from me. We haven‚Äôt talked much beyond a few friendly ‚Äúhi/hello‚Äù moments, but I‚Äôve noticed she‚Äôs come out of her place several times right after I open my door‚Äîenough that it feels intentional, like she might be trying to create opportunities to cross paths.

A while back, she knocked on my door twice to borrow a screwdriver and some glue, which felt kind of random but also like an excuse to connect. There used to be a guy who visited her regularly, but I haven‚Äôt seen him around in a while.

Lately, I haven‚Äôt run into her as much because my schedule‚Äôs been tight, but I‚Äôve been thinking about leaving her a short, friendly note. Nothing flirty or forward‚Äîjust something like:
	
‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve appreciated those little interactions and was glad she felt comfortable reaching out before.

	‚Ä¢	Since we‚Äôre neighbors, it might be nice to actually get to know each other a bit more.

	‚Ä¢	No pressure at all‚ÄîI totally get if she‚Äôs seeing someone or not interested.

	‚Ä¢	My door‚Äôs open if she ever needs anything.

	‚Ä¢	And here‚Äôs my number in case she ever wants to chat or grab a coffee sometime.

My goal is to keep it light, friendly, and respectful‚Äîno expectations. I just don‚Äôt want to make anything awkward, especially since we live so close.

And in no way meant to shame anyone who was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes. It is not your fault, and you couldn't have done anything to prevent it. 

I just want to share my positive experience because I feel like I mostly was seeing the negative ones when I was googling prior to my test this morning and it convinced me that I was doomed to have a bad experience. 

My midwife ordered a 1hr glucose test with no fasting, and told me that I was okay to go ahead and eat breakfast but to try to keep it low carb, and an hour in between eating and the test. I had 2 eggs and a cup of cottage cheese for breakfast along with my drip coffee with creamer and then waited an hour before heading over to the lab. 
I picked the lime flavor because I had heard that fruit punch was a doozy and orange didn't sound exciting to me. It had no dyes, and honestly tasted like a melted lime otter pop! It was super sweet, but also 10 ounces, so it wasn't that hard to get down. They had me stay in the waiting room for the duration of the hour, and within 10 minutes I did experience a tiny bit of nausea, but didn't throw up or have to fight the urge. After an hour was over they called me back for the blood draw, I was still feeling a little nauseous but mostly good. I was able to drive myself home and make lunch and after eating felt so much better! I did have a little bit of a sugar crash and laid down for a half hour to rest, but have had no other side effects. My results just came back in on MyChart and I was way below the cut off at 73 and passed with flying colors! I am so glad that I went in and got it over with. If I would have had GD, it would have been completely fine and I would have adapted to whatever was necessary, but I honestly was more stressed about the test itself than the outcome. 

I just wanted to share this because every one is different, and experiences things differently, but not a lot of people take the time to share positive experiences. So if you're a hypochondriac like me, and have been falling down the Reddit rabbit hole, just know that there's a possibility that you could take the test and have it be only mildly uncomfortable!",2,1744153722.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

Use a coffee grinder to grind dried plums into a fine powder. 
 If the plums are too sticky, and clumps together instead of turning into a powder; You can use tapioca starch in small amounts and grind it again and it should turn into a powder.
Also, you can use this in cupcakes to get a plum flavor where you couldn't usually use plums in a cupcake.",1,1744153420.0,Cooking,0,0.67,False

**SUMMARY:** (\~1600 words)

Your goth roommate comes home from work, and finds you looking depressed on the couch ‚Äì another date has ghosted you. Feeling protective of you, she persuades you to come to the goth club with her tonight, a far cry from your normal routine. She's so persuasive that you decide to take an even further step outside your comfort zone .¬†.¬†.

**TERMS:**

* Gender-flipping is always welcome.
* You can fill, post, and monetize freely. Just credit me (as u/RHfactoral) ‚Äì and if your fill is behind a paywall, let me download a copy for myself. Either way, let me know you've filled it ‚Äì I'd love to see what you've done!

* You are free to make cosmetic/surface modifications (name changes, minor wording choices for the sake of flow, ad libs), as long as they don't drastically affect the plot line and overall atmosphere.
* You are not free to add anything hateful/bigoted/xenophobic to this script.
* SFX are suggestions, not rules. I use square brackets to describe things like physical actions or scene/location transitions, but you are free to use sound effects for those moments ‚Äì or not ‚Äì at your discretion.
* The same goes for music ‚Äì I'll provide links to free-to-use suggestions, but you're always welcome to use something different ‚Äì or nothing at all.
* Constructive criticism is always welcome. Invited, even.

**KEY to stage directions**

\[Square brackets indicate character actions and possible SFX\]

(Parentheses indicate tonal or other such cues for the VA)

*Italics* indicate a word to be emphasized

Ellipses (...) indicate a pause for emphasis. A (beat) is a slightly longer pause than that. Space between paragraphs indicates a pause for the listener's ""dialogue"" (or a moment of quiet between listener and speaker)

A dash ( ‚Äì ) at the end of a sentence indicates an interruption

**VA NOTES**

The speaker is, by nature, kind of guarded and sardonic, but has bonded with the listener in the several months they've lived together. She's become rather protective of them, and though her default is kind of brash and banter-y, she will flip to gentle concern for the listener in an instant, when it's needed.

The listener is socially anxious and nerdy, but trusts the speaker enough to step outside their routine. They're implicitly autistic, but this is never said outright.

**‚Äî BEGIN ‚Äî**

Hey, roomie, I'm home! And I come bearing .¬†.¬†. pizza!

No, I mean *real* pizza. The ones they started making at work are terrible. Worse than off-brand frozen crap.

There you are! You were so quiet, I wasn't sure where you were. Here. I'll get us some .¬†.¬†.  (gentler, concerned) Hey. You okay?

For one thing, I can tell you didn't eat lunch. There's no plate on the coffee table.

I *know* you. You always wash your dishes before you go to bed. Always. But if there's not one on the table, you haven't used one today. That means you didn't eat, or you just ate more Pop-Tarts, which might as well be the same thing. What's wrong?

Yeah, you mentioned them. You were setting up a lunch date for today, that's right.

""Sort of?"" Oh, no .¬†.¬†.

Oh, hon. I know how much it sucks getting ghosted. I'm sorry that happened.

*Again,* yeah. I know that just makes it worse.

Yeah. And it's hard *not* to take it personally. (beat) For what it's worth, you deserve better than that. Better than them.

You absolutely do. And one way or another, I'm going to find a way to convince you.

Okay, you know what? I was planning on going to the club tonight. This time, I'm finally taking you with me.

(playfully assertive) Oh, no, I'm done asking. I remember you telling me about getting the doorman treatment at L'Etat Du Mort. They're not around anymore, and almost nobody liked them while they were. Xenophile is the complete opposite of that. I really do think you'll enjoy yourself.

That's right. I *do* have to defend the honor of goth. And *yours,* too. You deserve to have a proper experience with the scene, even if you decide clubbing isn't for you.

(more gentle and serious) Listen. For real: If you really don't think you're up for it, I won't push you. That's not going to make for a good time. What I will tell you is this: There's some friends of mine there who would like to meet you, and I think you'd like them.

(a bit bashfully) Because .¬†.¬†. you come up in the conversation, sometimes.

Because you genuinely are a cool and interesting person. Even if you don't feel like it right now.

Look, I know you wouldn't feel comfortable if I just dropped you in the middle of a bunch of people you don't know. I promise you: I won't do that to you. I'll be right beside you. And if you're uncomfortable after we've been there a little bit, we'll leave, together. I'm not going to leave you hanging.

Maybe I *am* trying to be your wingman. Would you be okay with it if I was?

""Maybe,"" huh? Seriously: Do you trust me *not* to steer you into a total disaster?

Good.

So, here's the plan. We eat some of this pizza. I get a shower, enough to wash the smell of wilting sandwich toppings off of me, and unless you have a change of heart, we'll head on out.

I *meant* it when I said that. If we get into the parking lot and you don't think you can do it, we leave. If we get to the bar and it's too much for you, we leave. If you seize up at having three hot goth girls talking to you, we'll all try to put you at ease, and if it's still too much, we leave, you and me. No questions, no shame, no argument from me.

Yeah. Me, and two of my friends, Martina & Lucretia.

(more soft-spoken and soothing over the course of the next several lines as she guides the listener through a breathing and visualization exercise)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy. You're okay. It's just you and me here. Yeah? Yeah.

Just listen to my voice and close your eyes and breathe, slowly. Deep breaths, just like that. Keep going until you feel yourself start to relax.

Better? Good. But, tell you what, keep your eyes closed for a minute longer. I want you to visualize something that might make it easier to handle going to the club with me.

Humor me, huh? Just imagine the scene I'm going to describe, even if you leave your eyes open.

Okay: Imagine me, and two other girls sitting around a table in a nightclub. I'll even show you a picture of the four of us .¬†.¬†.

\[gets on phone and pulls up picture\]

Here we go. Taken inside the club, even. That's Lucretia with the black hair, and Martina with the green and black hair.

I'm not going to lie, we were all looking pretty good that night ‚Äì but you know what I look like when I come traipsing around in sleep pants and no makeup in the morning? They're no different, so .¬†.¬†. if you do start getting anxious, just remember that. We might show up to the club looking like Siouxsie Sioux, but in the morning, we all look like Robert Smith in pajamas.

(chuckles gently) There you go. I thought that might make you smile.

Anyway: You're taking your seat at the table; I'm sitting on your right side. They introduce themselves, completely chill. They're not trying to act like femmes fatale, or trying to fluster you ‚Äì they're just making small talk. What do you think of the club? Who's your favorite band? Where do you work?

Mmmm-hmmm. You ask them similar questions, and .¬†.¬†. just pay attention and ask followup questions. You're getting them to tell you things, and letting them do the talking. Getting *them* to do most of the talking.

(listener is starting to tease her, which she returns, her voice slowly returning to normal tones)

Just like you do with me, yes. Gawd.

You don't need permission to ask me a question, silly. Just ask.

You'd like me to help you dress for the club? You're just fine as you are, dear, I've told you that.

(interest piqued) You *want* to? *Really?*

(with some enthusiasm) Makeup, too? *Wow.* Can I ask what brought this on?

(chuckles at getting called-out) Okay, smartass, you're right. It *is* just a figure of speech. Now can I get you to tell me what made you decide you wanted to go all-out?

Mmm-hmm .¬†.¬†.

No, you're absolutely right: If you're going to step out of your comfort zone, why *not* push the envelope a little bit?

I'm proud of you. And I promise not to make you regret it.

Come on, then, follow me to the bathroom.

\[They go to the bathroom and she gets out some cosmetics\]

Let's see how you feel about a little eyeliner for starters. Something easy to take off if you don't like it.

Here we go. You don't have to sit; we'll give you something simple. More Gary Numan than Rozz Williams.

There. Turn around and take a look.

Yeah, it's kind of unusual for you, but I think it works. Next question: How do you feel about black lipstick?

It's not really *that* high-maintenance, but that's fair, I get it. How about .¬†.¬†. eye shadow, then?

I think you could pull it off. Give it a try?

(reassuringly) Yeah, it's easy to wash off.

(excited) Yes!

\[grabs eyeshadow\] (hums the Sisters of Mercy, ""[Temple of Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_W3VykYhWA)"" while applying the eyeshadow) Let's just go with a nice smoky grey .¬†.¬†. just keep holding still .¬†.¬†. No, you're fine .¬†.¬†. almost done .¬†.¬†. there. One eye done.

Now for the other one .¬†.¬†. .you're doing so good. Like you're used to doing this.

Mmm-hmmm. I cannot wait for you to see this. You look really good in makeup, for real. And I'm not just admiring my artistry, either: It gives your eyes this kind of .¬†.¬†. sultry look? (beat) Aaaand .¬†.¬†. done. (beat) Yeah. I'm going to roll with that: ""sultry.""

I'm *not* buttering you up. Turn around and look in the mirror. Pose, even, like you're modeling for an album cover.

(extra pause as the listener looks at themselves in the mirror and makes a self-deprecating comment)

(softly exasperated) Oh, my god, do you really *not* see how gorgeous you are? You just gave me the most smoldering look I've ever gotten from another human being, ever. You start throwing that look around on the dance floor, I may have to start throwing hands just to get you home in one piece.

Yes. Yes, I do mean it: This look really suits you. It's a very mid-to-late 80s goth look, especially with that wavy hair of yours.

\[She runs her fingers through the listener's hair over the course of the next couple of lines\]

I'm going to tell you right now that girls are going to want to touch your hair, especially with you looking like this, so .¬†.¬†. you may get asked about that, a few times. If you don't feel comfortable with that, like you do with me .¬†.¬†.

You're okay with that? Good. I've told you about Martina ‚Äì the one right next to me in that picture? She's socially anxious like you are, but with people she knows and likes, she's been known to play with people's hair. If she does ask to touch your hair, it means that she's feeling really comfortable with you.

Anyways: This look on you isn't gaudy or garish. It's not Marilyn Manson or black metal ‚Äì it's subtle. And if I didn't make it clear enough: You do, in fact, look good like this.

That's right, you do. And more. (softly) But seriously, what do you think? Think you can wear this to the club?

(extra beat as the listener replies with appreciation and gratitude)

Awww .¬†.¬†. you are just so sweet sometimes. (sighs happily)  I'm glad you're going with me. You've been so good at showing me cool things, things I never knew I'd love. I want to be the one to show *you* something cool tonight.

Thank you. (chuckles) But right now, I'm going to have to push you out of here for a moment, so I can get showered up and ready. I'm starting to pick up whiffs of too-close-to-room-temperature cold cuts on me now.

(laughs) I'll take as long as I need, thank you very much. But I won't be too long. If we get there before midnight, the cover charge isn't as much. And I want to get you there before it gets more crowded, anyways, to give you a chance to adjust.

(gently) You've talked me through plenty of sad nights. You've looked out for me. So, yeah. I'm going to look out for you, too.

I promise you: You won't regret letting me nudge you a little bit out of your routine. I'm going to make sure you have fun tonight.

So go on and have some pizza while I'm in here. Put on that playlist we both put together, to get yourself geared up. I'll grab a slice or two before I put my lipstick on, and .¬†.¬†.

\[start fading out\]

No, I said I didn't think it was *high* maintenance. That doesn't mean‚Äì (beat) (chuckles) Stoooop, I gotta get ready .¬†.¬†. (laughs)

Both my mom and dad smoked back then, so much that there was ash on the ceiling of our old house (our new house does not have that because my mom switched to vaping, and if my dad smokes he opens the door to let it out). His health record has been really unfortunate. Sometime ago he had to go to a hospital and stay there for a bit. I think it was a year ago maybe two (2023-2024). My mom would go visit him since it was a whole hour away, and my older brother would drive her. Eventually, me and my other brother got to go see him too. He had a tube put in him. I don't remember what he was even there for, probably treatment for his collapsed lung. It was scary to see him like that but he was doing really well back then and the hospital room he was in was dim, calming, and casual rather than being all white and stuff. Then, in 2024 I think, my dad took a scan of sorts which showed where cancer could be forming/spotted. I'm not exactly sure how it works so it's hard to describe. But he would go to the doctors sometimes and they always said whatever they were doing was working. However, recently, in 2025, the main doctor reread his scan and realized that the doctor (not him) that was supposed to read the scans and write down what's wrong, COMPLETELY read his scan wrong because apparently they didn't even know how. So the cancer has been moving to other systems of his body this whole time, and now it's made him practically unable to walk. He has a wheelchair. He's been throwing up and has to take a bucket with him on car rides. He can't drive anymore, and hasn't been able to drive for a while. His back practically kills him, and I'm pretty sure it's spreading to his spine too. If only they read the scan right the first time, maybe he would have had a better chance. His voice has become quiet and raspy most of the time, he coughs a lot, and he can't lift anything anymore. He's been listening to Christian songs more than ever. Today, he called me, my two older brothers, and my mom up to where their shared bed is. He was laying there and he told me and my older brother since my other older brother and mom already knew about the doctors visits since they are the ones that take him. He told us that the doctors visits haven't been so good, and that at this point they don't know what's going to happen. He doesn't know if his legs will ever work again, if he'll ever feel the same again. He also said it might just be his time. I'm very sensitive and cry very easy, so I broke down in tears right there and we all had a moment. My dad has always been my biggest supporter. Anything I said I wanted to do with my future, he'd agree with. ""You wanna be a singer? I think you can with hard work!""  ""You wanna be a youtuber? I think you can!""  ""You wanna be a doctor? I think you can!"" and to think that I might lose that support is tearing me apart. I'm crying as I'm typing this, but there's nothing I can do about this situation. I've never had something this bad happen. I've lost people in my family, but I didn't know those people like I knew my dad.  Thinking about the possibility that one day, possibly close to today, he'll be gone. Having to walk into my mom's room and not have him there. Having to walk into the kitchen and not see his own cup of coffee poured on the table. Not seeing him gardening, or doing outside work that he loves to do. Not hearing his crazy, funny, stories and jokes that could make the most stiff person chuckle. It's killing me. I've always been the type to try and distract myself with whatever I can to feel better when dealing with something tough like a pet dying or something. I'd distract myself with school work, videos, playing video games online with my best friend, sleeping, drawing, but is that really the right way to go about it? Would it be the right way to go about it if my dad dies? It hurts to think that he might not see me turn 15, that he might not get to see me get ready for my first prom, or meet my first boyfriend, or see me get married, or meet my future grandkids, if I decide I want any of that. I at least hope that he'll make it to this 20th, because April 20 is Easter, which is his favorite holiday, so we could celebrate it together. I'd appreciate some support right now.",3,1744153225.0,Vent,3,0.81,False

For as long as I've had the car (about 3 years), it's done this. Currently it has 93698 miles on it and does burn it oil. Maybe about a quart every 1,000 miles or so. No leaks.

The Useful Few Doctrine suggests that in the future, when technology and economic pressures make it too expensive or unsustainable to support everyone, the system (whether a government or another central authority) will pick and choose which humans are ‚Äúuseful.‚Äù These useful people will be kept and supported while the rest are quietly phased out. The illusion of a full society is maintained by replacing most human roles with AI, androids, or digital simulations.


---

2. How It Might Work

A. Controlled Depopulation

Discouraging Childbirth:
The society might promote ideas or policies that make having children less attractive. Think of it like messaging where everyone is encouraged to focus on individual achievement instead of family life.

Natural Selection Factors:
Crises like disease outbreaks, environmental challenges, or engineered events can further reduce the population gradually. People might slowly ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù without any single event raising too many red flags.


B. Keeping Only the ‚ÄúUseful Few‚Äù

Selection Criteria:
Only those with rare skills, high obedience, or unique value‚Äîlike experts in key fields‚Äîare kept. These people could be seen as indispensable for maintaining the system.

Specialized Roles:
The chosen few might receive extra care, education, and resources to ensure they continue to contribute to the society‚Äôs goals. They might also be incentivized to monitor or enforce the rules that keep the system running.


C. Simulated Normality

AI and Android Replacements:
Instead of replacing every human, only public-facing roles are filled with machines or digital simulations. These ‚Äúreplacements‚Äù perform everyday activities (like serving coffee, working in offices, or even interacting on social media) to make it seem like society is still full of people.

Digital Illusions:
Online platforms, data signals, and even smart devices contribute to creating a picture of a bustling, lively community. In essence, while only a few real humans remain, the rest is just a carefully managed show.


D. Staged Realism Through Controlled Violence

Maintaining the ""Human"" Factor:
A completely calm and perfect world might feel too artificial. To retain a sense of realism, the system might occasionally allow small-scale conflict or ‚Äúcontrolled violence.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt random chaos, but scripted actions designed to mimic normal human behavior.

Public Distractions:
Minor crimes, controversies, or online dramas are staged to distract people from noticing the overall emptiness behind the scenes.

3. Deep Implications and Criticisms

Ethical and Moral Issues

Dehumanization:
This theory suggests that if societies value efficiency over humanity, they might choose to deem most people as expendable. Ethically, this presents a deep moral challenge‚Äîare humans simply tools to be culled when they no longer ‚Äúfit‚Äù into the system?

Loss of Diversity:
Limiting the population to a ‚Äúuseful few‚Äù could strip society of creativity, diversity, and unpredictable human value that often drives progress in art, science, and culture.


Practical Challenges

Complex Selection Process:
Determining who qualifies as ""useful"" isn‚Äôt straightforward. Human potential is diverse and sometimes unpredictable. History shows that many unconventional ideas and people have changed society in surprising ways.

Detectability:
Even with advanced technology, such large-scale manipulation risks being discovered. People are naturally curious, and secrets of this magnitude might eventually slip through.


Psychological and Social Effects

Psychological Impact:
If people sense that they‚Äôre being reduced to mere components in a grand experiment, it could lead to widespread societal apathy, distrust, or even rebellion.

Social Fabric:
Real human bonds‚Äîfriendship, love, community‚Äîmay erode when a large part of society is an illusion. This could further weaken the sense of identity and purpose, even among the ‚Äúuseful few.‚Äù

4. A Visual Way to Imagine It

Imagine a large theater:

Backstage: Only a small crew (the useful few) knows the full script and running of the show.

Front Stage: Hundreds of actors (androids, AI simulations) perform a routine that looks natural and familiar to an audience.

Staged Scenes: Occasionally, a small fight or a dramatic event is set up to keep the storyline believable.

Audience: The few real humans (or even outsiders) watching may not notice the empty backstage, believing the performance is the whole story.


This stage is designed to create the illusion of a vibrant, normal society while carefully controlling and reducing the actual human presence.


---

5. Final Thoughts

The Useful Few Doctrine pushes us to consider:

The limits of technology: How far can AI and androids go in mimicking human life?

The value of individuality: What happens when efficiency outweighs the human spirit?

The warning signs: How can we detect when society starts valuing control and order over genuine human connection?


This theory is a thought-provoking exploration of potential future scenarios‚Äîa blend of dystopian fiction and cautionary speculation. It's a way to examine what might happen if technology, ethics, and government control converge in the most extreme ways possible.
