However, whenever a gal is a little extra nice to me, part of my brain goes ""ahaaaaa THATS flirting"". I wouldn't even be interested in the girl necessarily. For example, this barista I see about once a week, total sweetheart. Drew a smiley face and inspirational quote on the coffee cup. Super sweet! But that's not flirting.. in fact I'm sure she does that for ALMOST everyone who walks in the door🙄

 I know not the only guy to experience this, leaning towards men just makes it more confusing. Why is it that when women specifically showing men kindness our goofy brains just take it and fekin RUN with that. Dudes will be imagining the entire wedding, first apartment, and kids. Maybe overreacting.

1jh04wl,https://i.redd.it/0fg3eudf16qe1.png,I made an app to help you practice safe flirting because dating apps don't teach us how,"Hey everyone,

I want to show you my Practice Flirting app.

For the past 4 months I worked on this revamp and the app was approved on the App Store two days ago on the first go.

How did I come up with the idea?

Last year while I was looking for a new app to build I found lots of Reddit posts where people were asking about ""How to practice flirting"" or ""How to flirt"". Most of the posts had a ton of engagement and I thought that it might be a good opportunity to build an app which helps people with this problem.

The first version of the app was not great, but I got 4 customers and made $94. Two paid monthly and 2 paid for the yearly subscription.

What problem does the app solve?

Online dating apps are ""broken"". You either get no matches or if you somehow match you are ghosted or you have no clue how to avoid an awkward conversation.

We have to learn how to engage better in offline and online conversations.

How does the app solve the problem?

- There are over 120 structured video & text lessons, each with multiple questions. On each response you receive feedback and if you still have things to clarify you can ask an Ai tutor questions about the lesson.

- Real-world scenarios with voice practice. Multiple scenarios like coffee shop meeting or at the dog park etc. You have a goal and some tasks. Don't worry If you get stuck during the conversation, you can ask for hints. During the conversation an Ai analyzes your emotions through your language and at the end of the conversation you will receive a beautiful report which you can use to improve, see strengths or fix your weaknesses.

- 3 Daily challenges with different difficulty levels.
- Stats screen where you can see progress

I have a ton of ideas on stuff to do in the app, but I ll implement them slowly. Now I'm trying to get feedback from users.

The app is behind a paywall after sign in, because it might have Ai APIs cost. If you feel the subscription is too expensive or cannot afford DM and I'll make your account paid in exchange for feedback (  Make sure you don't hide email when you sign in so I can find you in the db )

Looking forward to your feedback.

1jh03ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/1jh03ck/replacing_missing_cabinet/,Replacing Missing Cabinet,"In our new (to us) house, a prior owner ripped out 1 upper kitchen cabinet and replaced it with more of a decorative system for storing coffee mugs and water bottles.  When they subsequently moved out, they took that with them.  The remaining cabinets are likely original to the house, builder grade, from 1998, but they've been painted white and have updated hardware.  The kitchen is well designed and laid out, and I can't see us ever doing a major renovation.

My existing cabinets have raised panel arch-style cabinet doors with a simple crown molding. 

It's  high on my wife's list to replace that cabinet, so I've had out a couple handymen and looked into the DIY route.  Today, I got the paint matched and purchased a quarter of paint.

I could purchase a pre-fabricated cabinet, but nothing seems to match well enough.

Otherwise, it looks like I have to hire a woodworker.  I found a well reputed guy who is very busy.  He quoted me $1200.  $1400 if he also does the paint, and says it will be as close to an exact match as possible.  The second guy I called out quoted $1300 for the same job, but I liked the first better and used him last fall for a door repair right after we moved in.

I am having a tough time stomaching that amount for 1 cabinet.  I am also worried once we get that 1 new cabinet the wife will realize just how ""builder grade"" our other cabinets are and she'll push for replacing them all, which would be 6-7 more cabinet units.

Is there a route I am missing for this? Does $1200-$1400 sound unreasonable for a cabinet built and installed in the midwest?",1,1742616309.0,HomeImprovement,0,1.0,False

I put in a bit too much thought into my comments.😵‍💫 So, thought of posting it. 

As someone who has been visiting Jaipur once every 2 months for the past 3 years :

Hate : 

🚌The complete lack of public transportation. No autos, a defunct BRT, and a fuck all metro. Very few e-rickshaws in the sprawling areas of Mansarovar, Vidyadhar Nagar,  Sanganer, or Jagatpura where thousands of people live.

🚙Increasing number of people in Jeeps or Thars who are driving like maniacs.

🏜️No government initiative to control dust. You'd think that's something a semi arid state would do.

🏗️Lack of micro urban planning. It's much easier to drive in Jaipur than in many similarly sized cities in India. The major roads are wide, and flyovers are plenty. But it's sad to see the first planned city in India has slums which are literally eating up the mountain in Kacchi Basti and Transport Nagar, and urban ghettos with no parking rules. What the hell does the JDA do apart from paint it's logo on flowerpots ? Also, almost no trees in huge parts of the city.

🚸No enabling infrastructure for tourists despite lakhs of foreigners visiting every year.

🍨A personal complaint : The bastardised version of Bengali sweets being sold at almost all Mitthai shops.

Love : 

🍻The insane number of broadly affordable rooftop pubs and bars. Something that is just not available in Delhi.

☕Hundreds of good cafes, big and small, with a refined coffee culture that will probably be as big as Bengaluru in the next 5 years. Again, not something you find in Delhi.

🏥The relatively better state of public hospitals. Been to government hospitals - SMS and Indira Gandhi, both of which are very good, when compared to major hospitals in many states. Trust me.

⛲The availability of water supplies throughout the year despite the drop in water levels around the Jaipur district and adjoining areas.

Colonel Jacob Blackburn is no stranger to danger. As a top test pilot for the U.S. Air Force, he’s trained for anything—except crashing a next-generation spy plane straight into the heart of the Bermuda Triangle.

Presumed dead, Jake wakes up somewhere he shouldn’t exist—a jungle teeming with prehistoric predators and secrets lost to time. His first encounter? A towering, reptilian beast with the deadly grace of a dragon. His second? Three fierce, battle-hardened women who seem to have stepped straight out of ancient history. 

They are all that remain of an Amazonian tribe—warriors who have survived, against all odds, for millennia. Stranded in their world, Jake forges an uneasy alliance, using his military expertise to help them not only endure but thrive. But survival on this island is a brutal game, and the last of the island’s monstrous Dino-dragons still hunts them.

As Jake fights for a way home, he faces an impossible choice: return to the world he knows or embrace the one that has claimed him.

Because some lost legends aren’t meant to stay forgotten.

1jgzsr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGardenCorner/comments/1jgzsr2/do_vegetable_gardens_require_full_sun/,Do Vegetable Gardens Require Full Sun,"Do vegetable gardens require full sun? The short answer: It depends.

Every veggie has its quirks. Some need sunlight like humans need coffee.

Others are shade lovers, living their best life with less light.

Do Vegetable Gardens Require Full Sun or Some Shade?
----------------------------------------------------

On this sun journey, plants aren’t just sun worshippers or shade seekers.

Determining the right balance can be game-changing for your garden's success.

Here's how I cracked the code:

### Understanding Plant Needs

- **Full Sun:** Direct sunlight for at least 6 to 8 hours.
- **Part Sun/Part Shade:** 3 to 6 hours of direct sunlight or gentle dappled light over a long day.
- **Full Shade:** Less than 3 hours of direct sun, but some filtered light.

The classification isn’t universal, but it’s a darn good guide.

### What Veggies Need Full Sun?

Let’s spotlight veggies that love basking in full sun:

- **Tomatoes** – Thrive in full sun, gifting juicy reds when well-sunned.
- **Peppers** – Spice it up with adequate sun exposure for heat levels to rise.
- **Cucumbers** – These prolific plants drink up the sun to produce prolifically.
- **Squash** – Enjoys sprawling out where the sun shines fully.
- **Eggplants** – Buddy up with peppers in the same solar-soaked space.

Sunshine is their secret sauce.

### Exploring Shade-Loving Vegetables

Not all veggies are sun chasers. Some prefer cooler, shadier spots.

Here’s the lowdown on vegetables that embrace the shade:

- **Spinach** – Grows faster with a bit of shade, loves coolness.
- **Lettuce** – Keeps crisp and delicious with less direct light.
- **Kale** – Relishes cooler climates, won't bolt in shade.
- **Swiss Chard** – Thrives even with reduced light access.
- **Peas** – Prefer spring and fall with partial shade for sweeter results.

These leafy greens still make a fantastic harvest without much sun.

Is My Garden Getting Enough Sun?
--------------------------------

Quick check: How much sun does your garden spot receive?

Knowing this helps maximize your garden's productivity.

### Measuring Sun Exposure

1. Choose a day when you’ll be home from dawn to dusk.
2. **Observe:** Every hour, mark where direct sunlight hits the ground.
3. **Note:** Trees, walls, and structures that block the sunshine.
4. Add it up! Get a total to understand overall sunlight exposure.

**Pro tip:** Apps like “Sun Surveyor” can help with more precise tracking.

When in doubt, this makes it easier to assess how much sun you’re truly getting.

### What If I Don't Have Full Sun?

If full sun is sparse, it's cool to make the most of it creatively:

- Position **sun-loving plants** in the brightest spots.
- Embrace **container gardening** to chase the sun across your yard.
- Consider **vertical gardens** to maximize light exposure.

You’d be surprised by how much a little clever planning can do.

FAQs on Vegetable Gardens and Sunlight
--------------------------------------

### 1. Can I grow vegetables with less than 6 hours of sun?

Yes, some veggies thrive with less light, especially leafy greens like lettuce and kale.

### 2. How can I tell if my plants aren't getting enough sun?

If they appear leggy or there Check The Details Here: https://www.shebonny.com/category/garden/

I get it, the question of whether **vegetable gardens require full sun** often keeps you tossing and turning at night.

You’re not alone.

Gardeners have been trying to decipher this sun-ray riddle forever.

Finding That Perfect Spot in Your Garden
----------------------------------------

Here’s the deal, finding the sweet spot isn’t just about sunlight, it’s about the whole ecosystem.

Start by understanding the sun’s journey across your yard.

That’ll help you piece this puzzle together.

### Charting the Sun’s Path

- Morning rays are usually gentler—use them wisely.
- Afternoon sun can be harsh—it’s like a blast furnace even on sunny days.
- Look for those areas in your garden where the sun has a siesta.

Each angle offers different light and warmth.

It’s like finding the right balance for a perfect cup of coffee.

### Maximize Your Space

If you don’t have full sun, don’t sweat it, maximize what you’ve got.

- **Use reflectors** to bounce light where it’s needed.
- Experiment with **raised beds** to reach more sunlight.
- Plan to use intercropping techniques effectively to share the limited sunny spots.

Every square foot counts, trust me on this one.

Integrating Shade into Your Plan
--------------------------------

Shady spots aren’t dead zones; they can be perfect havens.

Some veggies are like introverts at a party—they thrive in quieter corners.

### Align Your Seeds with the Sun

Plant shade-loving varieties together to create a micro-climate.

This improves overall yield and keeps your green buddies happy.

I’ve found that partners like **spinach and kale** are unbeatable in this setup.

### Time Your Plantings

Seasons change, and so does the sun’s path.

- Plan your garden’s schedule around optimal sunlight exposure during different times of the year.
- Capture early spring and late fall sunlight for cool-season crops.
- Move to warmer spots for summer-loving plants.

The calendar is your guide here, follow its lead.

Common Worries About Sunlight in Vegetable Gardens
--------------------------------------------------

### 1. What happens if there's too much sun?

Yeah, too much of a good thing can be rough—wilted leaves and parched soil are signs of sun overload.

To combat this, use row covers or create small shade cloth tents.

Protect those tender leaves from getting toasty.

### 2. Is location more crucial than sunlight?

Both matter. You need a **balanced approach** to optimize growth.

Soil quality, water access, and air circulation play significant roles alongside sunlight.

Think of it as a well-oiled machine where every part counts.

### 3. Can I adjust my plant's light needs?

Moderation is key, you might need to shift some plants to a sun-drenched patio occasionally.

Try using platforms or stands to elevate pots for more sunlight.

It’s a bit of extra work, but often worth its weight in gold.

Sunlight's Role in the Bigger Picture
-------------------------------------

Sunlight isn’t just about getting those veggies to sprout, it's a touchpoint in creating a thriving ecosystem.

Consider integrating flowers and herbs that attract beneficial insects and bees.

They adore those sun-warmed spots too.

### Gardener’s Best Friend

- Flowers like **marigolds** offer nectar while doubling up as pest control.
- **Basil and thyme** play supporting roles while enhancing your garden's aroma.

Your garden isn’t just a space—it’s a living, breathing community.

Following this, Bryan's team [removed all the recently published CoAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/blueprint_/s/K9pa8JnEBX) from their website.

Multiple people told me this was just a one-off issue and that Bryan's cocoa powder is generally a good product. So, I decided to investigate a bit further.

The State of California recently filed a [60-day notice](https://oag.ca.gov/prop65/60-Day-Notice-2025-00544) concerning two of Bryan’s products:
- **Nutty Pudding** for excessive **lead**
- **Cocoa Powder** for excessive **cadmium**

Let's focus specifically on the cocoa powder.

What does this notice mean? It means that the product labeled **""Blueprint Bryan Johnson Cocoa Powder 7.5% Flavanols 800+ MG Per Serving Unsweetened""** exceeds the **Prop 65 cadmium limit of 4.1 mcg/day** at the recommended serving size.

However, notice something interesting—this is actually a **different product** from the one currently sold, which now advertises only **400 mg of flavanols per serving**. **Why such a downgrade?**

If you check archived versions of the product webpage between **February and March 2024**, you'll notice the **recommended serving size was reduced from two scoops to one**. This adjustment occurred because each batch Bryan was selling contained enough cadmium in two scoops to exceed California’s Prop 65 regulations. 

For example, in **March 2024**, the cadmium level was **0.553 ppm**—**still under the EU limit** of 0.6 ppm, **but two scoops would exceed California’s daily exposure limit**. I’ll attach a screenshot as proof. 

In other words, **Bryan’s cocoa powder was never truly low in cadmium**. They **knew it** and they simply adjusted the serving size to stay compliant.

1jgzq8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1jgzq8j/stop_misleading_people_into_thinking_chicago_is/,Stop Misleading People Into Thinking Chicago is Some Uber Cheap Utopia it's Not,"Chicagoans are OBSESSED with lying to people and saying that Chicago is so cheap compared to other expensive big cities, but as someone who moved to Chicago from another expensive big city (Washington, DC) for graduate school, people overstate how cheap Chicago is relative to other cities. In fact, I'm shocked by how arrogant Chicago is when it comes to pricing.

Chicago is cheaper than NYC and SF, and that's about it. It is not cheaper than DC. There's tons of newer apartments in DC neighborhoods like Navy Yard and NoMa that are under $2k a month for a studio (sometimes as low as $1.6k to $1.7k) and come with concessions like 2 months free. Meanwhile, equivalent neighborhoods in Chicago like South Loop, Fulton Market, and West Loop are charging out the ass for rent (many buildings are $2.5k to $2.9k a month for a studio) and are arrogant enough to tell you you can't park in their parking garage unless you rent at least a 1 bedroom or pay at least $3k a month in rent. These developments are nowhere near as nice as their equivalents in DC either. West Loop is a bunch of pretty apartments dropped in a fugly ass industrial area that looks like it will go give you cancer with nothing to walk to. The apartments will be dropped in the middle of nowhere and be across the street from dilapidated buildings. 

Even Hyde Park is massively overpriced by landlords who think they can manipulate UChicago students into paying crazy rents, but don't worry, paying $1.7k a month for a 1 bedroom in a building from 1932 with no dishwasher with a cockroach infestation, roofs that cave in, and in unit laundry is worth it because you can walk to some mid and overpriced coffee shop. Any newer apartment like Solstice will be $3k+ for a 1 bed.

And that brings me to my next point, food and parking in Chicago is also more expensive than DC. Chicago is one of the most expensive cities in the country for groceries, and many coffee shops will serve the shittiest coffee you've ever had and sell pastries that arent baked in the shop and bought from Costco's bakery, and they'll still charge you $15 to $20 for a coffee and a pastry. Street parking for two hours can cost up to $10.

That's the end of my rant. Chicago is a great city, but don't come here thinking it's a cheap utopia. You're still going to pay out the ass for rent, groceries, and transportation. Chicago is actually arrogantly overpriced for what it is. Chicago is asking for DC and Boston prices in neighborhoods that look like they're from gentrifying parts of Baltimore and Detroit.

One of their distinctive features was the round, silver buttons on the front panel and that two-tiered ""flowchart"" selection panel with the lines from the buttons to each one.

Before I get on the roads there I want to be aware of local laws/expectations/etiquette! I'll be looking for somewhere to do some intervals 2x a week, probably 3 long rides a week (3-6 hours) preferably through rural areas with some good scenery and 1 coffee ride with family. So it will be a mix of looking for serious roads to get consistent fast miles as well as some urban cruising and site seeing.

What do I need to know?

Is there any web-site, or YouTube channel with a good rundown of the rules?

Is it okay to ride in the car lanes like in the US?

How safe are the drivers around cyclists?

Are there any very strict laws that I shouldn't break? Rolling stop signs etc....

Any common mistakes made by Westerners?

Any recommended classics or KOMs in the Tokyo area?

Am I allowed to bring my bike on the trains?

If I happen to find a race I can do while I'm there, what do I need to know? Do they do same day licenses? Would love to find a criterium there... would be amazing to experience that in Japan!

Hey everyone.

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job and I travel a lot. I suppose it’s a good life, I don’t brag but I’ve been told that. It drives me insane because I’m always busy. I guess busy is good.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

I am a single man 46M and have been interested in my single woman 41F friend we have known each other for 10 years. My friend knows I am interested in her.

I had not seen or spoken to my friend for a week or two. Unusually for my friend, she rang me one evening. To my surprise, as she had never done anything like this before.

She now spent the next half an hour very persuasively and coherently seducing me. During that call, she repeatedly offered me sex with her and kept confirming it was what she wanted. It seemed to me to be well over the top if she did not mean it or was playing a joke. Without hesitation, I could tell she had used her charm and seduction skills before. We agreed to meet the next day.

We met for coffee only half a day later and are getting along fine. However, she now says she is no longer interested in anything.

I asked her why she called me and just got a blank face, with no answer. To me, she now looked guilty. I do not know why she did it. What was the purpose for either her or me, but she never laughed at the time like it was a joke it seemed genuine.

It was not like she briefly mentioned an interest she spent 30 minutes non-stop seducing me and kept saying it was what she wanted. And she knows I am interested in her. I told her I was disappointed.

I do not know if I should see it as a compliment or a piss-take. It and depends on how I feeling or view it at the time. It is not something I have ever experienced before.

I now do not know what I am supposed to think of my friend or our friendship going forward after her call?

I also remember that despite what was going on, periodically one of the main characters would go visit his friend who was a dr in a hospital and they would talk. Usually references to old black coffee were dropped.

The last thing I remember is it had some sort of supernatural element to it but that part didn’t come into the story until a few episodes in.

1jgzi5k,https://i.redd.it/ap8jhuj4v5qe1.jpeg,Read body for the drama if curious!,"I got three new roommates not last fall but the fall before. Two new suit mates, who I’ll just call Lucy and Abby (fake names). And then my roommate, who is now my friend (don’t share a room with her anymore because I was hospitalized for some of the month we were supposed to put in our forms, and she never got the email so never reached out to me). When we all lived together I think they hung out with me at least once together. I don’t know why. Actually I do. People in general know there is something abnormal about me. It throws them off. All three said they think they have ADHD, so maybe they’re also different although I would think you would be understanding to someone you feel is different. I was functioning though. Took my medication, deep-cleaned during my cleaning week, did my dishes every other day (my suit mates would leave it in for days but I never brought it up because it wasn’t an issue to me). Bought my stuff when it was my turn to buy. Sometimes more because I was out and about and didn’t mind chipping in. Never complained to them or about them. Genuinely I had no problems with them and thought we were on good terms. I talked with them, was always upbeat and positive. Abby was really passionate about Palestine so every time she brought it up I would call my representatives for her. I once went to a protest but the police showed up so I left, plus it was outside the hospital I go too. And like I mentioned, I really liked them. I thought we got along great. I even told them about my schizophrenia. So during finals week, it was Lucy’s birthday and she invited her mom up to visit her. For reference her mom is a… complicated person and personally I would think some of her behavior isn’t great, although I would never say that. So her mom brought her friend up and was just showing her friend around. Lucy and Abby came up with this lie that I assaulted my friend to tell her mom so she would let her leave. Abby called Luna on the phone and pretended to be the RA. I don’t know why they just didn’t say the toilet was overflowing, but oh well. So Luna came back and put fake eye drops in her eyes (her mom came back to the dorms) to make it seem like she was crying. After all that she told me what she said (originally Abby just said they lied about something). So at this point I’m getting worried. I don’t have family here and would have to find another place to live if her mom reported to the towers that I assaulted my friend. It wasn’t my best moment but I did cry in front of them. Lucy didn’t say anything and Abby spoke for her, saying that we can’t tell anyone. Side note it was karaoke night at the dorms and I LOVE karaoke. I called my parents and they said I have to put in an incident report. So we all went down and talked to an RA where we put in a report saying it never happened. I was to sad to go to karaoke night 😭. I think Lucy and Abby thought I was being overdramatic, maybe I was. The thing is is that I feel like I bring out the worst in people. Like I feel like if I hadn’t lived there they would have come up with another lie. So both end of moving out. Lucy to go live with her aunt and Abby because her mom told her too (I think her mom also thought this was bonkers). We get new roommates in spring and they’re both great :D. So later in the spring semester Lucy texts my friend that shes coming back to the apartment to pick up some stuff. I came back from food shopping and my friend told me “by the way Lucy is in the kitchen.” I don’t know why Lucy didn’t tell me she was back. Probably because I suck. At first was like *Im going to be so mean and ignore her* but I didn’t. I saw her and was super friendly and even said “it feels like there’s something missing when you guys are gone”. For reference neither of them apologized. So flash forward to last fall Lucy reaches out to my friend again through text. Since then radio silence. Then last week she texted my friend again and said she was coming back. So they met for coffee, together, and then Abby also showed up. Never told me they were coming back. Honestly I probably did something wrong and hopefully I can figure it out in hindsight. Currently talking with my therapist about it.",3,1742614342.0,TrollCoping,0,1.0,False

I’ve been living in Berlin for 5 months now (28M). I’m a composer and currently support myself by teaching piano. I have Tuesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays off, and I’d really like to use that time to do something I’m passionate about, which is coffee.

Since 2015, I’ve been deeply interested in coffee. I’ve read a lot, experimented, and even roast my own beans at home. I enjoy the freshness and the process a lot. My long-term goal is to open my own café, so I’m looking for a job in a coffee shop to gain practical experience and connect with new people in a social work environment.

I speak English fluently. My German is still at a very basic level, but I’m eager to learn and improve. If you know of any opportunities or have any suggestions, I’d really appreciate it!",2,1742614257.0,berlinsocialclub,0,1.0,False

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'm aware my comps might be too big but I'm not sure what else to put, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

Dear \[AGENT\],

The books will tell you that natural killers evolved to near-certain immortality. Perhaps that’s why they’ve always been feared, why using their powers is tantamount to a death sentence—for both them and their target. And no one knows that better than seventeen-year-old Kit Cinnabar.

Two years ago, a family scandal involving the servant her brother murdered sent Kitty’s world toppling down. So she doesn’t hesitate when her House offers her a second chance at glory. In exchange, they want her to steal a magical relic from the tombs of a long-extinct House. But as she hijacks Seaside vaults and dodges bullets, Kitty encounters an assassin… the most notorious natural killer left alive, and one the Order must detain for reckoning.

Ever since Valentine Szell cried tears of blood the morning of his mother’s death, he knew that he could never be what Kitty wanted—not her best friend, certainly not something more. Now taking jobs from the dirty side of the Slat’s Magic Market, Valentine bears a secret: A thousand scars mar his back, the marks of all those he’s killed… because killing is the only thing natural to him. 

Then, after years of silence, a stroke of luck reunites him with Kitty. Valentine’s almost ready to give up everything to repair their broken friendship… just as his next mission threatens to upend his convictions. He’s sent straight into the path of a masked, elusive thief—a girl who’s already trying to kill him. Better yet? He has no idea she’s the Kitty he met for coffee yesterday.

But soon, their masked personas are forced to team up in the search for the relic… one that may hold unfathomable significance for both Velmora and the passion beginning to flame between them. The cards that fortify the secrets of the Houses are collapsing, and these unlikely partners will be caught up in the annihilation—if they don’t destroy each other first.

NATURAL KILLERS is a YA fantasy complete at 90,000 words. It’s a standalone with series potential—in which secret identities meet the adrenaline kick of *Six of Crows* and Indiana Jones. \[personalization\]

Open to any Jewish woman in southern or southwestern Ontario. For the fight woman I'm ok with other locations as well.

I’m looking for a serious, monogamous relationship leading to marriage and kids.

**About me:**  

I’m secular, agnostic, and culturally Jewish. I enjoy our traditions and celebrate holidays with my modern Orthodox family (they're chozrim betshuva).

I’m 171cm, slim, in decent shape, and gradually improving my fitness - focused on health, not aesthetics. I'm caring, loving, honest, and very loyal. I have also been learning how to cook. 

I work as a full-time as a Product Development Specialist (fancy Software Developer). I'm blessed with technical skills, both on a computer and DIY.

Dual citizen (ISR+CAD). Lived in Israel, then Australia, and in ON since 2016. Left Israel after the service. Pro-Israeli. I speak Hebrew, English, Hebrish, and Englew.

I enjoy photography, programming, board games, hiking (especially with a partner), travel, family time, and humor - especially dad jokes and puns (and I make a lot of them, you’ve been warned!).

Recently, I’ve been reading mostly non-fiction: psychology, history, philosophy, and similar topics. That being said, I read Harry Potter more times than I can count.

A few more fun facts: 

I don't drink coffee and alcohol, but I was a barrista and a bartender. Yes, it will be my pleasure to make you a cup of coffee. Yes, every day, but only if it'll make you happy (even if only for a moment). I'll also be happy to cook for us. But I despise folding laundry.

**What I’m looking for:**  
- A Jewish woman who’s emotionally mature, self-aware, and serious about building a healthy and loving family  
- It is important to me that you'll be maternal; I am looking for someone who wants to be a loving and present mother for her kids.  
- Age: ideally 30 to 32, but 25+ is fine if you're in the right place in life.
- Someone who doesn’t have kids yet but wants them   
- Looking to get married and starting a family within the next few years  
- Good sense of humour who won't find my jokes too dadly
- Monogamous, honest, and an excellent communicator  
- Employed, career-driven - I'm not looking for a doormat, I'm looking for my future wife (strong,  independent, and intelligent women don't frighten me. I actually find it attractive)
- Any Jewish ethnicity (including a convert) is fine   
- I'm ok with you going to shul, but I won't join you   
- I do not keep kosher, but I'm willing to give up pork if it bothers you    
- Must be Zionist.
- Any height, any reasonable weight (more important - be healthy)
- Bonus: Kinky, sex-positive, huge foodie, loves to cook even if you're not good at it (I'm learning to cook too, no shame in learning!)    

**Non-negotiables:**  
- No games. I value direct, clear, and honest communication. You’ll get the same from me - guaranteed.  
- Mental health matters. It’s ok to not be ok, and it’s ok to not be perfect (who is?), but if you don’t take care of your mental health, we won’t be a match. I recently completed my own therapy journey and I’m proud of the work I’ve done. I’m looking for someone who’s done the same or is actively doing it.

1jgz3v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jgz3v8/i_got_scolded_for_drinking_water_when_i_was/,I got scolded for drinking water when I was feeling sick,"
For context, I do figure skating, and this incident happened at an ice rink. The issue occurred after the main entrance, but before you enter, there’s the ticket booth, a small lounge area, and then another entrance that serves as an access point where they check your tickets. 

I was having an off ice class, and towards the end, I started feeling very nauseous, disoriented, and like I was going to faint, I had already finished the water I brought with me in a steel water bottle, so I asked my boyfriend, who was outside, to bring me a water bottle. The rink’s cafeteria was closed, so he bought one from outside the rink.

When the class ended, I went toward the entrance to grab the water bottle and asked my boyfriend to go get my skates from our car, so I was alone for the next part. I planned to drink the water there since they are very strict about bringing in anything that’s not from their cafeteria. However, I’ve seen people eating and drinking before the access point, so it seemed to be a bit of an allowed loophole.

The moment I took the water bottle, a girl approached me and told me I wasn’t allowed to drink it there. I explained that I was feeling very unwell and needed the water or I was going to faint. She seemed taken aback and left for a moment, only to return with what I assume was the manager. The manager was very rude to me, but I explained again that I wasn’t feeling well and was just taking a moment to drink some water. I also told her I had no intention of bringing the water bottle inside. She was still not satisfied and tried to snatch the bottle from my hands. I didn’t let her, and I told her again that I just needed a moment to regain my breath. I explained that I would ask my boyfriend to take the bottle outside, but I needed to stand there for a bit since, apart from the heat, there was nowhere else to stand outside, and I was really afraid of fainting. Where I was standing, at least, there was a half wall I could lean on.

Still unsatisfied, she began screaming at me, which I ended up ignoring since I was feeling so out of it. By the time I started feeling better, my boyfriend returned with my skates, and the lady was threatening to blacklist me from the rink. I simply told her, ""Okay,"" gave the bottle to my boyfriend, and went to put on my skates to prepare for my next class.

I thought that would be the end of it, but today, when I went to the rink for my classes, I was stopped at the main entrance by someone I believe to be a higher-level staff member. She went on and on about the water bottle I brought inside, and I tried to explain that everything had happened in the main entrance where we were, but she cut me off every time and started speaking louder. She didn’t care about anything I said.

Finally, I cut her off and asked where all of this was going. She told me I had to pay a $200 fee for breaking the rink’s rules, and if I didn’t, I wouldn’t be allowed to leave or enter the rink. I told her she was crazy and asked her to show me where such fees were outlined in their rulebook. If she could show me that the fees were regulated and established anywhere, I would pay her. She couldn’t. So, I told her I was going to leave, and if she tried to stop me, I would call the police since she had no factual reason to prevent me from leaving.

Afterward, I texted my coach and told him I wasn’t going to take any more classes because I was refused entry. He immediately came outside to find me, and when he asked what was wrong, I just broke down and started crying. I felt so wronged and helpless, and the feeling of not being able to defend myself just hit me all at once.

My coach is so much more empathetic than the rink’s management. He even offered to give me classes at another rink, which I appreciate, but honestly, I’m afraid he might get in trouble for that. In the past, coaches who’ve worked at different rinks have been severely reprimanded by the rink where this happened, and some have even been forced to stick to their contracts with threats.

I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if I’m just too emotional, but I feel like this whole situation has been so unfair. It’s like the rink is more concerned with enforcing rules to the letter than actually helping people, especially when someone is genuinely in distress. I just needed a moment to breathe and drink some water and even explained to them that I wasn’t going to take the bottle to the ice or any other zone of the rink, but I feel like I was treated like a criminal for it. It is a long text and maybe it feels just like a whole bunch of context but it just feels so unfair, specially when I have seen people in the ice with coffee and snack that are not from the rinks cafeteria, I don’t know if the girls that work there don’t like me and felt like it was the perfect moment to inconvenience me since it is the first I break the rules, and even so it’s not like I maliciously did it ",4,1742613022.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,0.84,False

1jgz0lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jgz0lb/this_is_the_crazy_story_of_my_ex_bestfriend/,This is the crazy story of my ex bestfriend trying to ruin my life after getting with the guy I was seeing yet labelling me a cheat. AITA for being too close to my friend's partner and outing a lie that upset another friend rather than staying quiet ?,"Okay everyone so this was my original post with a lot more clarifying details ..

My best friend tried to ruin my life after she got with the guy I was seeing and then painted me the cheater after I'd been close to a friend partner... AITA?

Okay so maybe get your cup of tea and biscuits for this one ...

Okay so myself (31F) and my former best friend (32F), let's call her Amy were like sisters. Then things went strangely wrong and then alarmingly.

So firstly, this girl was like my sister... I loved her and my sons saw her as their aunt. We had been single mothers together and supported each other a lot especially after I escaped a really bad dv situation. I thought she could never do anything wrong to me and we were really connected especially as we started doing tarot together and set up a little buisness. It made sense as we were always on the phone, hours every day and barely went a few hours without speaking. Our friends joked we were married and couldn't be apart long.

Things started to go wrong when she stopped pulling her weight in the buisness. I worked constantly to the point in made me ill yet she never did anything near as much if at all most weeks.I was live 5 to 6 nights a week doing readings on tiktok as well as crating resin art with spirtual and tarot themes, candles and charm pots plus nore...after working all day and having the kids all evening yet she would never join lives and left It to me after the first 2 months. Eventually I met someone through the lives who I came to start a relationship with, let's call him Ian, we became close after he helped moderate my lives and promote the business. He even made a new logo on Amy's demands (i let her have her say to appease her and keot my input minimal) yet he also felt she didn't work where as i was constantly live, promoting, making videos or talking and arranging clients as well as producing stock. Amy did nothing accept order crysyals that took her from February all the way to November to put on the website.

Her and Ian were friendly too and I never thought anything of it. I trusted her and fell in love with him. He suddenly started being cold with me when we spoke hours every day (he lived a couple hours away) and were usually really happy to speak and were planning a future. Amy then suddenly became less communicative and he broke up with me on the Tuesday and by the Thursday she suddenly needed 'space' and time to herself. From talking everyday for hours, i suddenly couldnt text or call her. It was atrange and like we fell out without a fall out yet she needed space like i did something wrong. Me and him were still speaking and I was hoping to reconcile but he kept being really cruel and saying I needed to be independent and not need Amy and and should be 'alone'. He kept telling me repeatedly to be alone and berated me for a week whilst I heard nothing of Amy. My other friends thought it was strange especially as Ian confirmed they still spoke. 

Eventually time moved on and he left the picture and Amy reappeared apologetic but blaming Ian and how he impacted our friendship as she didn't like him and felt pushed out. She admitted she'd not defended me as hes spoke bad of me and I did question if anything happened yet she said no. This was in August.

Fast forward to October, AMy still had not participated in a live and was expecting to share private readings and earn 30 pounds (half) for a client after doing no work to get them and participating minimally as i did the main tarot reading and she supported m with a pendulum or occasional oracle cards. I was working so hard and kept asking for help. Eventually after months and months I snapped especially when my son eith special needs was heavily disregulated and i was struggling alone with him. I was working hours everyday and she wasn't doing anything and kept saying ""we'd pull it back later"" or she'd do other things than the live but didn't do much accept edit the website suddenly to a completely different colour scheme that was deemed a 'bad myspace' look by other friends and customers. I was so frustrated. I worked all day and she only worked mornings and hard a partner. I tried to meet in the middle after she blamed me for doing too much off ny own back, so I asked her to craft candles whilst I carried on the resin crafts and lives but could she make videos as well. Nothing changed abd Eventually I snapped and bluntly started asking what are you doing business wise today? And saying what needed to be done that day so what could she do?  Thus began the almighty downfall...

She began to get distant and hard to get in touch with. She wouldn't hang out as friends and did very minimal posts and a tiny rarely made handful of tiktoks. Of course Still wouldn't go live and share reading work. I was never nasty but I was becoming ill from overworking. She denied not working despite taking months off and never participating in readings. I eventually had enough totally after she finally came on a live for the first time in months and suddenly left embarassingly after 20 minutes. I said it was unprofessional and her excuse was her partner came home yet I didn't feel that was enough of a reason given they had a whole house and it had been promoted over a week and our first together live in 6 months. I said I was also worried for her as she wouldn't socialise and I wanted to spend time with her even for a quick coffee and I was her only real friend and it was so distant. I felt bad afterwards but I tried to say it concerned as she barely left house and was constantly smoking the green kind.She responded by ignoring me before eventually saying ""no point in hanging out for 2 hours"" and she did want to be in the buisness but couldn't do more than 2 lives yet then messaged my friend Hayley across the street for a coffee 🤔

After this she left the business by her own choice. I asked her to stay but she wouldn't. I oractically begged stupidly and keot apologsing. Prior to this i had spent days chasing her as we had a fayre and she would instantly read messages then take hours to respond or answer for me to decide for her and not help. She stopped ringing me when she rang constantly daily for years before and now I couldn't speak to her. I didn't have her stock of crysyals and I spent hours making up for the stock crafting necklaces etc She bluntly messaged she was out and her sister and boyfriend sent me nasty messages. I tried to stay her friend but she ignored me. She decided to sell her crystals and I promoted her business on my website with links yet she blocked me from seeing it personally. I tried so hard to be nice and I sent her son a Christmas present yet she ignored me still. I left the door open to be friends but she wasnt interested and then she decided to make my life hell. I even still promoted her new crystal business on my website for weeks after and recommended her still even when she blocked me and started spam commenting my other friends tiktok then blocking her and other little strange games.I just wanted to try be a good person and keep my karma clean.

It all really started a couple of weeks later when she went into my old place of work and approached a friend to say we had fallen out and other things and this was then relayed to my mother out of concern. I brushed it off and asked her not to do this and just not discuss me as I didn't want drama and wanted us both to be happy especially as we were so close people were shocked we werent close. This continued to escalate despite me never doing anything to her. It was just mean girl things at first... posts cutting me out of memories, messaging my friends she only knew and saw through me (yes red flag I was her only real friend) and then she Eventually stole from my PayPal that was previously shared. It was only 15 pounds but was Petty. Then it got serious. She reached out to my close friend who lived opposite we will call shelly, who is pretty temperamental. She told her a littany if lies including I hit my child, the kids are scared of me and I was having a 4 year affair with our other neighbour across the road who I'd been friends with well over a decade and his Mrs was my bestfriend who Amy asked for coffee... we will call her Hayley and him Tom.

Shelley stormed in my house one night after ignoring me for weeks to accuse me of this affair. I was beyond shocked. I Eventually convinced her of the truth that we were just friends and I wouldn't do that to Hayley. I also pointed out id just kept to myself and wasnt talking about Amy or making any drama and focusing on the buisness, I hadnt actually said anything bad about her her or said wed fallen out to people. A week later I went around and we had a drink and she apologised properly. The lies all came out including that Amy and Ian has been 'inappropriately messaging'but only so Amy could 'prove'i couldn't trust him. I just said I found it funny as it was the first I heard of this proof. I brushed it off hurt but didn't react as I'd already blocked Amy after a month of her games of blocking unblocking and slagging me off. I didn't want the drama and I believed in karma. My main concern was the lies I had hit my child and shelly Amy and Amy's sister had been in some sort of group chat constantly slagging me off for weeks. I was hurt but just wanted to move on and forgave shelly.

Next thing I saw my friend who is friends with Hayley. They had a another friend poppy who they were going to dinnner with later and somehow Amy had befriended her and managed an invite from her. I knew more drama and lies were coming and I told Hayley about the accusations and she laughed it off. She found it ridiculous. The meal happened and Amy seemed to behave but my 2 friends weren't keen on her and saw it all as 'games' and had no intention of seeing her again. I thought it may have been finally over but 2 days later my phone blew up with nasty texts from Hayley and calls (I blocked her on everything but text as we never spoke that way and forgot) accusing me of ringing the police on her off a welfare check which would have been an issue due to all the illegal green stuff she always has in the house. I still dont know if this really happened or just more lies. I told her clearly I hadn't and to leave me alone ... I hadn't rang the police just like I don't hit my child. Shelly then messaged me saying Amy messaged her calling her a liar (I never named shelley) and she'd never said I hit my children. I confirmed with the police I never rang them and forwarded on the email to Amy and as she had blocked Shelley, I thought it was done. 

Nope it just got worse.

The next day, my door was nearly kicked in by a very angry Hayley. We were terrified as didn't know who it was initially so I hid upstairs with the kids and then heard her screaming I was a 'slag'. It turns out the lovely Amy had been to visit Poppy to show her 'screenshots' of my affair. And wow these were fake screenshots... turns out its very easy to do. They were insane! There was dirty conversations between myself and Hayley's partner that never happened and were just crazy. Hayley blinded by rage and without checking threw her partner out and all my friends stopped speaking to me. Hayley is incredibly volatile angry which Amy new and takes a long time to calm. She's lovely 90% of the time but angry Hayley is quite scary similarly to the known temper of Shelley who can be violent.

Weirdly, Hayley and her partner had previously set me up with his brother. We had a thing on an off for a few months a couple of years ago and still in touch. Brother works with police and is extremely intelligent thus checked my phone to disprove the so called screnshots and confirm the truth. It was violating having my ex read years of conversations including things about Ian and even things I'd said To my friends about him at the time. He confirmed I was telling the truth but Hayley was busy telling me to go die and everyone else had iced me out so I didn't know what to do. I had nasty posts on my business page and messages and all over a guy who was just a friend!

This is where I may be the Ahole. After all this, things didnt ease up and there were posts of my business page and many abnoymous reports I snapped. I didn't want my business ruined or people reading publically on Facebook via Tom's business page or mine that I was a wh**e specially when it was beyond rational that I would ever have been possible to have such a long standing affair with Tom and never would. I sought legal advice who told me not to retaliate (I wasn't going to but Amy had many many skeletons including lots of cheating stories and was obsessed with accusing  others of cheating) and that I could look to send a cease and desist letter at cost and look to an Injunction and even damages case. I sent a message (my first one! ) on a group chat including the metal friend, hayley and Amy (mutual hadn't blocked so I could) I fairly stated it needed to stop. I was civil but in my rage I did say Amy needed to stop as it it went to court everything she's said would be outed including the 3 potential fathers of her child and that she'd accused Shellys partner of cheating which I new was a lie then as I do now. I firmly said I would involve the police and sent the cctv of Hayley trying to smash into my home and damging my back door and breaking my clothes Airers. I then left the group and hoped that would be ir after I stated I would press charges on everyone if it didn't stop. I hadn't done anything to anyone and wasn't messaging anyone. This was true. I didn't react to anyone. However Shelley rang me aggressively saying when had was her partner meant to have hit on Amy ... I told her the story that apparently he drove to see her and made a 'move'in the car. She called me a liar and said she'd spoke to Amy who already told her the story and was just saying he drove irrationally. I said firmly how could she know to tell that exact story before anyone even spoke to me if she never told me it saying he tried to cheat and I was lying ? It was clear as day she lied but shelley blocked me and Bow is vestiges with Amy. Shelleys partner rang upset and told me not apologise but why did I bring him into it. I said I'm sorry I picked an example upset of her lies thinking it would stop her acting more when she realised I could tell everyone the mass of lie she tells. He was upset but we agreed to be civil. I feel horrible about that. It was the first time I reacted and didn't think. I was so upset and I had been isolated and attacked for months and scared my business would be ruined.


 A few days ago Hayley asked to speak to me after 8 days since she screamed and attacked my door. Finally calmly we spoke and she believed me . I explained about Amy's behaviour and what has been happening. I also explained I don't think I'd be set up by my ""lover"" To date his brother and so on. She did however think that before we were friends that I was too close with her partner and when I escaped dv I leaned on him too much and she felt it was an 'emotional affair'. I accepted this an apologised . There was never any sexual intent and I was laone on a newly built street with him as my only friend close by who understood as we both had PTSD. I didn't mean to cross any line and life had moved on years since and I was so close to Hayley and me and him had drifted apart. Hayley and I have began speaking again and (touch wood) Amy has gone silent.

Currently Hayley and our mutual friend are speaking to me atm again not quite normally but getting there. Hayley's partner is still kicked out and due to other issues she doesn't know what to do or if she wants him home. She did confirm though that Amy and Ian did have something happen between them and a lot more than texting. I didn't want to hear the exact details but now I know Amy ruined my relationship, didn't work and quit the business to then bully me and try isolate me. She seemed to want to take my friends and have my boyfriend when she has her own partner and my friends were friendly to her too but not actual friends by her lack of effort over several years.I can never ever get why or understand as still I have done nothing to her. After Hayley and I spoke in person, we spoke again a few days later and Shelly saw. Suddenly Amy unsent over a hundred messages and said she no longer wanted to be involved. Touch would things are quiet but Tom and Hayley still aren't back together and I no longer speak to Tom as not to upset Hayley. Shelly just gives me dirty looks and ignores me and i feel I can breathe again but still so hurt. 

I can't take anymore drama. I've probably missed bits but I think that is the key breakdown and I will update.

AITA in this ? Did I deserve this for being too close to my guy friend in a difficult time and for upsetting Shelly and her partner bybusing them as an exanple of Amy's lies? It just all seems crazy and like a bad episode of shameless in a remote village. Should I have stayed quiet... not pushed Amy to work in the business or outed her lie about Shelly's partner? 

I would genuinely appreciate any input. Thankyou amazing people 💖 ",2,1742612711.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jgyvh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BanGDream/comments/1jgyvh4/sakikos_characterization/,Sakiko's characterization,"First, I didn't make this post with the intent to cast a judgement on the show's writing quality. So, it would be much appreciated if we could refrain from the discussions devolving into that.

Anyways, I'm trying to organize my thoughts regarding Sakiko's characterization and there's a few things I can't place:

(1) Sakiko's look of ""disgust"" at Uika during Imprisoned XII in ep10 doesn't line up with how kindly she treats Uika in ep12. Now the answer is probably that ""disgust"" is not the correct interpretation, but I can't place an alternative.

(2) In ep10 Sakiko is miserable that her bandmates forced her to holding up her end of ""taking responsibility of their lives,"" yet in ep12 she embraces ""becoming God""? I'm not sure when the turning point in her thought process was --- I suppose not getting on the airplane? But that had to do with Sakiko's grandfather --- there's still the whole CRYCHIC / Ave Mujica dilemma that Sakiko was stressing about in ep9, and part of the reason why (I had thought) that she was unhappy about the developments in ep10.

(3) In ep12 Sakiko comes to the conclusion about taking initiative of her own fate (""I have come to realize there is no need to meekly accept fate,"" and ""It was due to my lack of own determination that I ended up dragging everyone into this."") But wasn't that what she was trying to do when forming Ave Mujica in the first place? I guess I'm not sure what's different this time for Sakiko specifically, other than cutting out her obligation to her grandfather. (Perhaps this also ties into the next point...)

(4) Throughout the show we have the notion of people needing to remove their masks --- Umiri being a fake idgafer, Mutsumi / Mortis DID, Nyamu's acting insecurity, Uika's lying. I'm not really sure what to put for Sakiko for this? I feel like her ""becoming God"" shtick is still hiding behind a mask. Like she formed Ave Mujica to forget about the past, she tried to forget about everything when Ave Mujica disbanded. She did end up realizing she can't forget about CRYCHIC, but then she's still trying to forget in ep12 wrt Uika's past, the whole coffee scene and even the root of ""becoming God."" The one thing that Sakiko did (sort of?) drop was her coldness to everyone and pushing others away (though she still is kind of like that to Uika in ep10.) But even that kind of stemmed from her need to assert control (not wanting others to know about her family situation) and that control aspect is still kind of an aspect of her ""becoming God"" shtick? (Maybe not...)

I'm sure I mischaracterized / misinterpreted many things in my writing above so feel free to tear my thoughts apart.",2,1742612255.0,BanGDream,3,0.75,False

I’m visiting Tokyo and Kyoto in about a week and would love your expert advice on what to pick up while I’m there. I’m especially looking for local or Japan-only stuff that I won’t easily find back home.

Totally grateful in advance for any tips—and hope this is a fun one for you to answer too!

Here’s what I’m on the hunt for:

**1. Clothing & Workout Gear**

* I love elevated, minimalist style (think neutral tones, clean silhouettes) and I’ve already got Uniqlo & GU on my list—but I’m curious about other affordable local brands. Any favorites?
* What are some Japan-only or lesser-known clothing brands worth checking out in Tokyo or Kyoto?
* Any places that sell good-quality workout wear? Looking for Lululemon/Alo vibes, but cheaper.

**2. Konbini + Supermarket Food Finds**

Convenience stores are my happy place and I plan to try everything, but I’d love to know your can’t-miss items or brands—especially in these categories:

* Iced coffee or latte recs (milk coffee, black, oat milk if that exists?)
* Good konbini or supermarket breakfast options
* Frozen fruits
* Yogurt or kefir (does kefir even exist in Japan?)
* Matcha-flavored anything—snacks, desserts, drinks, you name it!

3. Skincare Must-Buys

Japan is skincare heaven and I want to take full advantage. Here’s what I’m hoping to grab:

* Overnight masks (the kind that goes clear as it absorbs—hydrating + glow, yes please!)
* Lightweight moisturizers that actually work
* Tretinoin (can it be bought OTC in Japan? If so, where?)

If you have favorite stores, drugstores, chains, or specific products—drop them all. I’ll be taking notes (and probably buying too much)!

Thanks so much in advance!",16,1742612233.0,JapanTravelTips,6,0.94,False

Basically, I've been out of home, backpacking on the other side of the world for over a month which has been great, and it's an adventure, not a vacation. But I also really miss and crave my routine where I look after myself and try to actually love myself

I'll wake up, fill my 2 litre water bottle so I drink enough throughout the day, it had cute affirmations on it🥰 I'll put on my moisturisers, and once a week I'll do a face mask so maybe I'll hate my ugly fckn face a bit less🤢🤮 Each night I'll put on my relaxing foot cream to help me sleep🫂 I make myself either a coffee or a smoothie in the mornings and put in my food supplements (to help me gain weight)☕️ 
I miss it😥 

One day when I was in a hostel, there were some Canadian guys who looked at me like a piece of of shit. They asked if I work out. Another Canadian guy looks at me and says verbatim 
'Does he fuckin' look like he works out?'

Anyway, I was looking through some of my travel photos today, and I clicked on a photo a tour guide took of me earlier in the day 
I couldn't have ever hated myself more when I saw the picture, I thought I looked fucking revolting. Why do I have to have hideous spots? What's up with my fat forehead? My nose is too big! My smile looks ugly on me! 
I never want anyone to ever have to put up with me when I see my face, like, I understand it when my sister says how ugly I am, I get why my dad doesn't like me 
I can't even bear looking in a mirror, my face is absolutely disgusting 

What I'd really like is a cuddle, someone to snuggle with 
Can anyone maybe chat and support?",0,1742612196.0,backpacking,6,0.2,False
1jgyus3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jgyus3/barking/,Barking.,"l could never sleep at night. 

My sleeping problems began when I was eight. It went a little something like, my dad made me watch The Hills Have Eyes, alone, with the lights off, because I had been a little too much of an antagonist in school. That’s when the bad dreams began—I always thought those cannibalistic mutants would come from under the bed, or out of the closet and devour me in the darkness. From that day forward, I basically never slept the same, and it was a new, terrible thought every night that kept me awake, banishing the prospect of a good night’s rest completely. And even now, 19 years later, everything remains the same. 

  Two days before today, I couldn’t sleep because I was thinking about my ex-girlfriend, Naya, and about how badly things ended between us. 

  Yesterday, I couldn’t sleep because I knew that today, I would be closing on the purchase of my new home. 

  Tonight, I can’t sleep because I’m on an air mattress, in a 1,400 square foot home, with no furniture, no amenities, just me and my thoughts.  And my neighbor’s dog. He’s been barking all damn night, and i’m really hoping his owner shuts him up soon. I have work in the morning, which i’m absolutely not looking forward to, because I have to be up and out of the door in 6 hours. God. 

  The next morning, I went to work and got bitched at by my manager for being late, like usual, and I contemplate whether I want to make today my final day, the same way I do almost every day, but the bills won’t pay themselves. I left work at 4:43 P.M., and stopped to grab a coffee and banana-nut muffin before making it to the house. I talked to the Italian girl, Claudia, who always works the drive-thru. I’m almost positive that she likes me, but my recent breakup has me feeling reclusive—I say a few shy words and speed off, beelining through the streets to make it home.  

 As I pull into the driveway, I see my new neighbors standing outside—a white middle aged couple who look like they’re going on a date, in the way that older people do. You know, nice collared shirt and slacks for the man, floral dress for the lady. The guy is about 6’3, 200 pounds, graying blonde hair, side part, goatee; the woman is almost the exact opposite, maybe 5’3, auburn hair, 125 pounds soaking wet. She’s wearing glasses and he isn’t. Their dog, a pitbull, the one who finally stopped barking last night at 1 A.M., sits behind their fence sniffing pockets of humid air. I glance at them quickly, noticing that they’re already looking at me, and I extend a friendly wave to them. In return, they muster confused, but warmhearted waves. 
 
  I speak to them as I step out of the car, swallowing the last of my banana-nut muffin.
“Hey guys, nice to meet you! I’m Charles.” 
  
  The guy says with the savvy of someone who’s done this a lot, “Hey, how do you do there friend? I’m Andrew, and this is my wife Annette.” 
 
  Annette gestures a friendly wave, but doesn’t say much. I mainly have a pleasant conversation with Andrew, who seems like he usually does most of the talking. We first discuss the neighborhood, the people in it, and I get the vibe that I made the right choice choosing this neighborhood. Everything is pristine, the people are friendly and wave as they pass by, it’s really a nice neighborhood. After further discussing a plethora of other obscure topics, none at all truly important, we prepare to bid each other farewell. I shake the hand of Annette, and then Andy, who’s told me to call him Andy, as everybody else does. We share goodbyes, and I begin up my driveway. 
  Their dog continues its gaze upon me, not diverting its focus once since I spoke to its owners. 

  After I finish the leftover pizza that’s been in the fridge since yesterday, I unwind on the air mattress, fresh out of the shower. There’s no point in getting dressed, no one is here with me. I scroll through YouTube first, then Instagram, then Twitter. I open Reddit and read a few r/relationshipadvice posts, my focus diverted every few seconds by white noise, some car passing outside, and Andy and Annette’s dog barking. Tonight he was howling more than barking, in the way that a dog who wants a treat would. I blow it off, and after an hour, I’m asleep. 

  𝐀 𝐅𝐄𝐖 𝐖𝐄𝐄𝐊𝐒 𝐏𝐀𝐒𝐒, and I’m outside cutting my grass with the new lawnmower I bought, after the neighborhood kids tried to over-charge me 200 dollars to cut just the front side. Refusing to conform, I figured it best to do it all myself. Only twenty minutes in, i’m drenched in sweat, and full of fatigue.

  I’m done cutting the grass around dusk, and I’m beat, dripping sweat like I just ran a marathon. The sun’s finally dipping, but it still screwed me over all day, and I’m kicking myself for not handing those kids 200 bucks to deal with this mess. I’m dragging the mower back to the garage when I notice Rusty—Andy and Annette’s pitbull—parked by their front steps, leash trailing in the dirt. He’s staring at me, same as always, those dark eyes glued to every step, not blinking once. I mutter, “Dog, you’re too damn nosy,” and shake it off, but that look’s sticking to me like humidity.

  It’s 11 p.m., and I’m restless as hell. Couldn’t sleep, so I’m out here pacing my yard, the night thick and sticky, crickets screaming like they’re in my head. Should’ve stayed inside, but my nerves are shot. I’m mid-lap when I spot Rusty again, sitting by their front steps. Leash dragging in the dirt, staring at me like he’s been doing since I moved in two months ago. Those dark eyes glint under the streetlight, and it’s still creepy as hell. I mutter, “Dog, it’s too late for this,” but my hands are clammy for no reason.

  I head back to my porch, grab a beer from the fridge—no furniture yet, just that air mattress and me trying to keep it together. I’m sipping, letting the cold numb me, when Rusty starts up—not barking, but this low, broken whine that stabs through the dark. I glance over; he’s at their back door now, clawing at it like he’s possessed, paws shredding the wood. He stops, stares at me, whines again—high and frantic—and noses the door open, slipping inside. 

  My chest’s pounding. Something’s wrong, and it’s loud in my head.

  I should stay put. Finish my beer, act like I’m deaf. But that whine’s got me paranoid, like he’s screaming my name. I set the bottle down, creep across the yard, checking their driveway—Andy’s truck’s gone, Annette’s car too. Out somewhere, I guess. The back door’s hanging open, and Rusty’s already in there, scratching like a lunatic. 

  I hesitate, heart slamming against my ribs. This is dumb—breaking in’s illegal, wrong, could get me locked up or worse—but my mind’s racing, telling me they’re watching, even though they’re not here. I slip inside, and the air’s thick, sour, like death’s been simmering.

  Rusty’s at a hallway closet, ripping at the floorboards, whining so hard he’s shaking. I whisper, “What’s your problem, man?” and yank the door open, palms sweaty. The boards are loose—one pops up under his claws—and a wet, rancid stench punches me: dirt, rot, blood gone thick and old. I grab my phone, flick the flashlight on, and shine it down, hands trembling bad. It’s a crawlspace, tight and black, and Rusty’s nudging me in, tail wagging slow like a countdown. I crawl through, every nerve screaming to run, knowing I’m crossing a line. The beam hits dirt, then—holy shit—a hand, skeletal, sticking out, clutching a badge. A cop’s badge, scratched with “𝐇𝐄𝐋𝐏.” Another body, a leg, twisted up, half-eaten. Bodies, buried shallow, skin peeled back, teeth marks everywhere.

  I gag, lurch back, but Rusty’s blocking me, whining louder, like, 𝐘𝐨𝐮’𝐫𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐧𝐞. I shine the light deeper, and it’s a shotgun blast to the soul. 

Four women, chained in the back, starved to nothing, barely breathing. One’s got a scar on her cheek—her face was on the news last year, missing cop from downtown, begging for tips. Another’s got braids, half-ripped out—gas station girl, vanished six months back, her mom crying on TV. My head’s spinning—I know them, I’ve seen their faces, prayed they’d be found. The third’s got her own fingers in her mouth, chewing, blood dripping; the fourth’s holding a skull—human, fresh, eye socket still wet—and rasps, “They made us… eat the rest…” A Polaroid’s nailed to the wall: me, asleep on my air mattress, taken from above, dated tonight, with “𝐘𝐨𝐮’𝐫𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞” scrawled in blood.

  I choke, scramble out, tripping over Rusty, who’s panting hard, muzzle soaked red—fresh, dripping, like he’s been feasting. My paranoia’s screaming—they’ve been watching me, they knew I’d come, this is a trap. I stumble through their house, hit the basement stairs by the kitchen—Rusty’s already there, clawing at a locked hatch. It pops open, and a scream—raw, dying—cuts out. I shine my light down: the four women, chained to a pile of bones, dozens of skulls, some with hair, some with flesh, a whole graveyard stacked neat. The cop’s clawing her chain, eyes locked on me, whispering, “They’re here…” I bolt out the back, crash into my house, lock the door—hands shaking so bad I drop my phone three times—and grab it, dialing 911, stammering about bodies, the news girls, Rusty, the skulls, my voice cracking as I check every shadow, every corner.
  
  Then I hear it—gravel crunching, slow and deliberate, like they’re taunting me. I peek out my window, breath stuck. Andy’s truck rolls in, headlights off, Annette’s car trailing. They step out, dark hoodies up, too calm, too quiet. Andy’s got a shovel, Annette’s got a bag—bulging, leaking red onto the driveway, a hand slipping out, badge glinting. Rusty’s at their steps, howling, jaws dripping blood, a braid hanging from his teeth—braid girl’s braid. They don’t rush, don’t glance my way—just head to their back door, keys jangling slow, deliberate. The lock clicks open, loud as a gunshot, and the basement hatch bangs—chains clanking, a scream choking off into silence. 

  My phone’s ringing 911, still no answer, as their door swings wide, Rusty’s barking tearing through the night. A shadow—tall, evil—stretches across their porch, holding something that glints like a knife, turning slow toward my house.

1jgyuk4,https://i.redd.it/3g7az21oo5qe1.jpeg,"If you were me, how would you respond?","For context, someone had been messaging me for months, and I replied a few times. There were some flirtatious and naughty messages between us because he never mentioned that he is in a relationship. In fact, he presented himself as single on Facebook. We met twice for coffee, nothing more. As I clearly stated in the chat, we did not have sex.

This morning, I received a message from someone claiming to be his boyfriend (see screenshot).

To translate, here’s how the conversation went:
Him: ""Kilala mo ba si *?""Me: ""Oo, kilala ko siya. Bakit?""Him: ""Nag-sex na ba kayo?""Me: ""Hoy, wala. Jusko.""Him: ""Jowa ko kasi siya. Nabasa ko yung chat niyo.""
After this, I apologized (see screenshot).

Before we ended the conversation, he threatened to expose me on social media if I ever messaged his boyfriend again.

If you were in my position, how would you react? Was it even appropriate for him to ask me outright if his boyfriend and I had sex? And is it valid for me to feel offended?

Thank you.

Is it possible to create an entire new Blockchain on top of BTC, with such small blocks that we wouldn't have a big impact on storage (for example 100 kB), and a confirmation time of like 10 seconds per block instead of 10 minutes? Also, would it be safe to after an X amount of blocks it automatically delets part of it's history, so it only has a recent record of the chain situation? That could prevent a ton of small blocks making a huge amount of storage over time.

I'm ignorant to the implications of this idea, but the way I see this is: You could make quick small transactions on it since blocks would be confirmed quickly, and you wouldn't need a full record of it like on the main chain of BTC, because your bigger stack is at the layer 1, so you don't have to worry about the record of a L2 Blockchain where some small amounts of sats are spent on a coffee.

Is this even possible? I know how the Blockchain works through analogies, but I have no technical knowledge about it to know if my idea is good, bad or even possible.",2,1742612045.0,Bitcoin,3,1.0,False

I have a college degree and I have a job. I didn’t need the job to get the degree, and I didn’t need the degree to get the job, because they’re totally unrelated. But I’m not bitter. Both of them have been good to me.

I’d be particularly interested in finding a penpal or two from overseas. English is obviously my first language, but I can communicate in Spanish, Finnish, and German as well, and I’m open to stumbling through other languages as we go if you’re really up for an adventure. 

At any rate, I’m interested in hearing your perspective on everything. What makes life good? How do our circumstances affect our outlook on life, our free will? Are you just wasting good coffee by putting flavored creamer in it? You know… whatever. I can’t promise that I’ll respond quickly, but I can promise that my responses will be thoughtful, well-meant, and maybe even funny if you like that sort of thing.

For what it’s worth, I like running (as much as one can “like” running), writing, singing, classical music, linguistics, and ruining my perfectly good mental health by overthinking things.

I’d be happy to start with e-mail and eventually move to snail mail if we actually manage to log a few message exchanges and get along haha. Gender doesn’t matter. I only ask that you be at least 25 years old and keep things platonic.

Thanks!

One day when I was in a hostel, there were some Canadian guys who looked at me like a piece of of shit. They asked if I work out. Another Canadian guy looks at me and says verbatim 
'Does he fuckin' look like he works out?'

Anyway, I was looking through some of my travel photos today, and I clicked on a photo a tour guide took of me earlier in the day 
I couldn't have ever hated myself more when I saw the picture, I thought I looked fucking revolting. Why do I have to have hideous spots? What's up with my fat forehead? My nose is too big! My smile looks ugly on me!

today my neighbour of 4 years is moving. she didnt even talk to me, i found out when she started the packing up her belongings and putting them into her car. i tried to strike up a conversation but she just gave me a tight smile.

“can i help with anything?” i offered

“no, its fine thanks” she replied, bluntly.

later that day her and her husband drove off for good.

it was sudden, but we were never very close and i assume theyve been planning this for a while. good for them.

i sit in my lounge wondering what to do for the rest of the evening. maybe i’ll just order chinese and watch some tv. shit. right. i misplaced the remote. ah well i’ll just watch netflix i guess.

a few weeks later another neighbour put their house up for sale. it was a flat shared by four professional 20-something-year olds. i guess its good weather and stuff so it kind of makes sense that people are selling right now.

weirdly enough last night i got this weird smell, something metallic, as i lay in bed. not sure what that was.

the next morning i came downstairs and one of the chairs was pulled out from the table, even though i couldve sworn i tucked it in. maybe im just being silly, i mean i probably just was tired and forgot to put it back before going to bed.

but i couldnt help but feel a little uncomfortable that day. as much as i want to, i really dont think i left that chair there.

today i caught up with my friend natalie for a coffee. her boyfriend proposed and theyre planning the wedding. they want to go to bali for a honeymoon, which sounds nice. she said i seemed a little off, and i admitted ive been feeling a but nervous recently. i told nat ive been thinking of investing in a security camera, and she said if it makes me feel better, but shes a little concerned it will just feed into my anxiety.

i guess shes right, plus being realistic it would be a waste of money anyway, and moneys already a little tight right now.

its been getting worse, ive started to hear footsteps some nights, but i never see anyone. small things seem to be out of place but nothings missing and all my doors are locked. i think i should talk to someone about this, im concerned about this.

its been a week and ive scheduled an appointment with my psychiatrist. i mean i know i have anxiety, thats nothing new, but this paranoia isnt normal and i need to get to the bottom of it. my third close neighbour miguel is apparently talking about wanting to move, but he hasnt said anything to me about it. apparently his kids are having trouble sleeping because of noise or something. i dont exactly know what he means, but its understandable.

19.03.25
today when i came downstairs in the morning, the light in the kitchen was on. i know i didnt leave it on, i even switch it on last night, i didnt even cook. a chill ran down my spine but i can just wait for my appointment, its only a few days away now.

21.03.25
today i walked out to miguel, as he hauled boxes into the moving van. hes a friendly man, but he seemed a little awkward now.

“hey so, how comes everyones moving right now? is there something up with this area or what?” i ask

he shoots me a sideways glance as he begins, before closing his mouth again and frowning. “well you know, its been waking us up a lot, its just been so noisy. ever since, well…”

“ever since what?”

“well i dont mean to judge, but ever since… well…” he trailed off uncomfortably.

“what are you talking about? ever since what?”

his wife and son approached with armloads more stuff and he stopped talking, shaking his head. “look im sorry its probably personal, i’ll just text you to explain later”

“okay…” i felt uneasy for the rest of the day. what was so personal he couldnt tell me then?

later that night, as i sit in bed watching netflix (not the tv, since i still havent found the remote), my phone pings. its miguel. im not even sure why hes up its past midnight, its 1:42am to be exact. but i open it anyway.

“hey its miguel :) sorry i couldnt say earlier, but the kids have been having trouble sleeping since that noise started at night”

“what noise?”

“i mean its not my business why he’s there, im not judging, but its ever since you started letting that man in through your balcony door in the early hours.” i stopped reading, fingers shaking. this has to be a joke. please be a fucking unfunny joke.

i took a deep, ragged breath, and i noticed that awful metallic smell again.

thats when i heard it.

So I decided to make a move and sent her an Instagram request in the weekend but I waited 2 days and I was disappointed that she didn't accept it, which seemed strange since she in the previous day asked me how many Instagram followers I have and showed a picture from her prom, so I took this as a hint, so I cancelled it and when I went on to the workplace she didn't mention this and spoke to me normally.

So we went to work for a week and continued to speak to each other but still I didn't understand why she didn't accept my follow request on instagram, so in her birthday she made a TikTok(she gave me her TikTok long ago) celebrating so I commented ""happy birthday, boss (her name)"", but for some reason she neither put a like or replied to my comment, which I failed to understand so as respond to this ""disrespect"" I stopped talking to her completely in the workplace and started to just act like she doesn't exist and have been like this for 2 days, she also stopped talking to me but for some reason I noticed that she is trying to get my attention, like standing in front of me or her coming in the morning to clean the machine I work on, I just doesn't understand  what type of game she is playing.

What do you think about this? Can someone   help on what to do?

2) Talk to her directly about this.

Hey Reddit, I ‘21/F’ have been living with three other girls for the past year (all ‘22/F’), so I’ve only known them for a couple of months. But lately I feel so uncomfortable in my own home that I’ve been avoiding the shared spaces as much as possible. To give you some context, I’m not from the same country as them, so there are some cultural differences and language barriers. I’ve made an effort to communicate, but I’m starting to wonder if my directness comes across as rude or if I’m doing something wrong.

One major issue I’ve been having is the cleanliness of our shared spaces. We each have a cleaning duty each week, but I feel like I’m constantly cleaning up after two of my housemates. For example, the bathroom was a mess—almost clogged drain, sand in the shower, and a red/orange stain on the floor. I asked them to clean it, but now I’m questioning whether I overreacted. I know I’m not perfect, and I’ve been working on the complaints I received about being too loud when coming home drunk on weekends. I’ve made a conscious effort to reduce the noise and go out less, and since then, I haven’t heard any complaints from them.

But here’s where things really get uncomfortable: One of my housemates has been letting her friends into the house without warning by giving them keys. They’ve just appeared in our home out of nowhere, which is super unsettling. I was told off for having my then-boyfriend over without telling them, so I started telling them every time he was over just to make them feel more comfortable. But my other housemate has her boyfriend over all the time, and there’s never been an issue with him having a key and just showing up without informing anyone—especially not me.

That’s not the only thing that’s been bothering me. They’ve made me upset multiple times. For instance, I was crying in the kitchen once, and no one acknowledged it, even though I overheard them talking badly about me just outside the kitchen. I feel like I’m losing my mind trying to figure out what I’m doing wrong. It’s hard when they don’t communicate with me unless it’s to ask me to do their chores or help with something.

There’s also the fact that half the time, I’m sleeping at my ex-boyfriend’s place with his roommates, and there never seem to be any issues there. They’re always friendly, and I feel comfortable. Meanwhile, my roommates have barely checked in on me, even after I ended up in the hospital a couple of weeks ago. Not a single one of them asked me if I was okay afterward, which hurt more than I expected.

On top of all of this, I’ve started hearing rumors about my housemates from other people. At first, I didn’t want to believe them because I wanted to think the best of them, but now, after everything that’s happened, I’m starting to feel like those rumors weren’t just gossip. I even reached out to one of their old roommates, and I’m meeting her for coffee soon to talk about my current roommates.

I just feel so uncomfortable in my own home. I avoid the shared spaces, and sometimes I sleep at my ex’s place just to escape the tension. I don’t know if I should confront them about everything, try to make it work, or just move out. Has anyone dealt with something similar?

My ice blended frappes are so frothy that I hate them. I've tried the 48oz and the 64oz tall container. I've adjusted the ice ratio, I've adjusted the liquid ratio, I've pre-blended the ice, I've run the blender after blending to get rid of the air bubbles, I've tried everything I could think of and everything that was suggested to me but I'm just not getting them the way I like them. Maybe I'm picky, but why should I suffer when life is so short, right?

So I go to the local coffee shop that has perfect frappe's and I see that they use ""The Quiet One"" with the advance container. They, like a lot of places, use ice, milk, and a dry frappe powder/mix. I also have a frappe powder mix that tastes great. The container has a different shape and a different blade than the ones that come with the non-commercial Vitamix's. It looks like the container has the same drive socket size as the 5200. The motor for the commercial blenders is supposed to be 2.2-2.3hp and the non-commercial one is 2.0hp. Since I'm not running it for very long, I'm sure that part will be okay. The centering base is definitely different, but I think I can pull mine off and slot in the one for the Advance container if I buy one of those.

Vijay Prashad17 Mar, 2025

It seems like a century ago I stood in the graveyard in Beirut's Al-Basta neighbourhood. There was magic in the graveyard, which is in an area of shops — bassata, from which the quarter gets its name, means to ""spread your merchandise on the ground"".

I had come on the advice of the Irish journalist Robert Fisk (1946-2020) to see where St. John Philby (1885-1960) had been buried.

During one of our coffees at Café Younes at the upper end of Hamra, I had brought along a copy of Elizabeth Monroe’s Philby of Arabia (1973) an old-fashioned biography riddled with errors but filled with charm — a book written based on Monroe’s conversations with Philby, who had gone from socialism to the British Foreign Office to Islam and then to being the principal advisor of King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia.

""You better go have a look at where Philby was buried,"" Fisk said. And what Fisk said, I did.

The jaunt, however, was a bit disappointing. I could not find his grave. It was said that Philby’s son, the famous British intelligence agent who had all along been spying for the Soviets, had scrawled on his father’s gravestone something about him being a great explorer. An ancient man at the cemetery told me that a lot of old graves had been covered over by the dead of the civil war.

I got lost on my walk back and found myself in front of the Maghen Abraham synagogue.

The building stopped me because it has an exterior that resembles a Venetian palazzo, the white and yellow ochre walls and embellishments a little out of place in what had been Beirut’s Wadi Abu Jamil, the Jewish Quarter. 

I understand why the synagogue had been built in this fashion. Beirut is a city of trade and merchants, and it made sense for the Jewish community to erect a grand building to rival other grand buildings (banks and markets). The neighbourhood had other synagogues, mostly in apartments, so this was a statement of the community’s establishment rather than of architectural fidelity to an ancient synagogue.

The synagogue was in mid-restoration. A café nearby was a good place to seek some answers. The man who ran it told me that yes, it is a Jewish place of worship, and yes, it is being resorted.

But, apart from making me a strong coffee, he did not have anything else to tell me. Later, the internet provided some answers, but it was also not sufficient. I went in search of someone who could fill the gaps of my curiosity and turned to one of the people I often sought out to explain the mysteries of Beirut.

Elias Khoury (1948-2024) was sitting at his desk in the Institute for Palestine Studies, chain-smoking and drinking little cups of strong coffee.

Born in Beirut during the Nakba that befell Palestine, Elias spent his life defending the Palestinian fight for emancipation. From his hospital bed, he posted on Facebook about his 'year of pain': ""Gaza and Palestine have been brutally beaten for nearly a year too, and they are resilient. They are the model from which I learn each day to love life.""

Elias knew the outlines of the story, but he did not know it all. He knew that the synagogue had been built in the 1920s, that it had been damaged during the civil war, and that it was only during the civil war that Beirut’s Jews began to flee the city – not because of anti-Semitism, but because their neighbourhood fell squarely on the frontline between the two major factions in East and West Beirut. ""The civil war drove the Jewish community out,"" I wrote in my notebook, probably quoting him. ""No one drove them out.""

Beirut's synagogue is also Calcutta's synagogue

Calcutta (India), where I was born, is not an ancient city. It was created by trade and resembles Beirut in more ways than I can tell you — there is something about our old cities that makes my blood flow faster.

When I was a little boy, my brother had a friend — Mordy Cohen — who lived in Calcutta's old Jewish quarter in Bowbazar. Mordy was a bit of a charlatan, who used to hustle the Rabbi to pay him some money so that he could help make a quorum on the days of low attendance in the synagogue.

It was in his home that I first got a taste of the spectacular Baghdadi Jewish Indian food, including the alu makalla that I make and enjoy to this day.

The historians of the Jewish community (Flower Elias and Judith Cooper Elias) say that the first recorded Jewish migrant to Calcutta was Shalom Obadiah Cohen, who came in 1798 from Aleppo, and then a wave of Baghdadi Jews came to trade in this British colonial city from the early 19th century.

Three families, at least, became fabulously wealthy: the Judahs, the Ezras, and the Sassoons – all traders in indigo, silk, and mostly opium. The Sassoon family cornered seventy percent of the opium trade that left Bengal’s shores for China during the 19th century — the details are in Phillip Stansky’s Sassoon: The Worlds of Philip and Sybil, 2003.

As if in a mirror, around the same time as the Baghdadi Jews came to Calcutta, they began to settle in Beirut and gave the city its first chief Rabbi — Moise Yedid-Levy from 1779 to 1829.

Nagi Gergi Zeidan, the author of Juifs du Liban (2020), spent almost thirty years fixated on reconstructing the history of the Jewish community of his country.

Zeidan’s own story is interesting: born into a family rooted in the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party of Antoun Saadeh, Zeidan developed an interest in the lost story of the Jews of Lebanon and then became the chronicler of that story just as Lebanese Jews left the country for the West and for Israel — although the more accurate book is Tomer Levi’s The Jews of Beirut: The Rise of a Levantine Community, 2012.

In his book, Zeidan has a portrait of the Maghen Abraham synagogue. Moïse Sassoon, who was born in Alexandria (Egypt) in 1867, moved to Calcutta, joined his family members in their thriving business and made his own money as a trader — his mansion on 8, Middleton Street is now an ugly building that houses several offices and apartments. 

Moïse’s parents Abraham and Ramah Meyer moved to Beirut in 1890, and his father died there seven years later. In 1926, in honour of his father, Moïse funded the construction of the Maghen Abraham synagogue.

Beirut’s hopes

Maghen Abraham was not just a place of prayer. It was a major community institution that included a sports club and a soup kitchen (La Gout du Lait or the Taste of Milk).

It supported the 14,000 Jews who lived in the neighbourhood just next to the French colonial headquarters (the Grand Serail), now the office of Lebanon’s prime minister.

What put this neighbourhood at risk was not anti-Jewish sentiment in Lebanon but its location. As the Lebanese Civil War broke out in 1975, the frontline within Beirut ran right through the Wadi Abu Jamil.

At one point, in fact, fighters from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation guarded the synagogue. But there was no way to protect the Green Line, the divide between West and East Beirut.

In 1976, Joseph Farhi took the Maghen Abraham’s Torah to the safety of the Safra Bank (Geneva, Switzerland) and two years later, chief Rabbi Yacoub Chreim left Lebanon. That was when the synagogue closed. In 1982, when the Israelis invaded Lebanon, they bombed the synagogue from the air and from sea, and in fact, accelerated the departure of the Lebanese Jewish community from their homeland.

PLO fighters stationed outside the synagogue during the Lebanese Civil War.

Eighteen years later, after an insurgency led by Hezbollah, Israel’s occupation of Lebanon finally ended. It was in this new period that the reconstruction of central Beirut began under a government-back consortium called Solidere.

In 2009, Rabbi Isaac Arazi, one of the leaders of Beirut’s Jewish community, expressed his joy when the renovation of the synagogue was included in the project.

Every single political group embraced the renovation. Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah said of the renovation, ""This is a religious place of worship, and its restoration is welcome."" In fact, Hezbollah contributed financially to the rebuilding of the synagogue, which was completed just after 2014.

Around that time, I went to see Mohammed Afif, who was Hezbollah’s spokesperson, in a very modest office in Beirut’s Da’aheh neighbourhood. Afif told me that Hezbollah’s views on the synagogue and Lebanon’s Jewish population are always distorted: Hezbollah, he said, is not against Jews, only against Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians and its attacks on Lebanon.

When I told him I was from Calcutta, where the money came from for the original synagogue, he said to me with a smile, ""Maybe get some money from there again to rebuild it."" Afif was assassinated in November 2024 by an Israeli bomb in Beirut’s Ras al-Nabaa area, not five minutes drive from the synagogue.

I noticed the first symptoms of acid reflux in the morning in my early 30s. Always lived with migraines. I don’t know if this post is directly about GERD.

Family history: My mother died of colon cancer but they did not find out till years later, by then she was already dealing with excessive period bleeding, etc. Her side of the family has a history of cancer. My sister also had cancer but she is in remission.

Mental stressors: I have always wondered if the women in my family and extended family fall severely ill because we are required to be independent, head-strong and always capable. It is tiring and I think I cannot be strong anymore. Obviously I have lived with extreme anxiety for years. In the last couple of years, the anxiety has muted and has become depression.

I have always had to take care of myself a much more than my friends because my friends could have a wild night and recover but I would suffer for days and weeks to regain my full potential. If I don’t sleep on time, eat on time and exercise regularly my body gives up in a week’s time. While I love adventure I have to think a million times before traveling and packing about what will I eat, how many medicines to carry, etc. I might be losing out on life because I stopped doing late nights and am fully sober. My biggest vices are coffee and sugar. My Achilles heel is my routine getting thrown off.

That’s all I wanted to say. Maybe it is all connected but I wonder if there was some chance that I could have stopped the illness from escalating to where I am now.

1jgy8i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jgy8i8/i_just_bought_a_new_house_my_kid_is_obsessed_with/,I just bought a new house. My kid is obsessed with the crawlspace.,"Buying a new house is never easy, especially in the modern market. Regardless, I had to move due to my job transferring me to their offices in another city, and so I had to sell my old home and move myself and my son, Ryan, a few states over.

We took a weekend to visit the city so I could tour a few homes that looked promising, and that's when I first visited our current house. It was a nice little two story with a big yard, perfect for a ten year old kid who loved to run around and play. It was during the house tour that we first found out about the crawlspace.

The real estate agent was letting me know some key details about the house, and Ryan was clearly not happy about being dragged along for something like this. As we finished talking the real estate agent seemed to notice this and leaned down to address Ryan directly.

""Hey kiddo, this must be pretty boring for you, huh?""

Ryan nodded.

""I was gonna save this for last, but...do you want to see something cool?""

Ryan nodded again. I gave the realtor a worried look, but he just smiled and gestured for us to follow.

We followed him upstairs to the guest bedroom, which I was planning on converting into Ryan's if we went ahead with the purchase. It also gave me piece of mind since the guest bedroom and the master were right next to each other.

The realtor went to the closet and opened the double doors for us to see inside. Nothing seemed weird until he reached down and pressed hard against a section of the wall. The panel sunk into the wall and rolled aside, revealing a small hollow space built between the two bedrooms.

""No way!"" Ryan said. He bent down and stuck his head inside the hollow space.

""What is this?"" I asked the realtor.

""Well, this home was custom built, see,"" he said, ""and the guy had this kid who wanted a fort or something, you know how kids are. Well, a treehouse was out of the option since nothing good for that grows around here, so the guy had this idea to build a little hidey-hole for his kid. I call it the crawlspace.""

""Well, isn't this a bit of a safety hazard?"" I said. ""What if Ryan got stuck in there?""

""Not to worry, ma'am."" the realtor said. He knelt down to talk to Ryan. ""Hey buddy, can you get in there and try to shut the door for me?""

Ryan obliged. He crawled into the hollow and tried to push the panel, but couldn't get it to budge.

""The panel can only be opened or closed from the outside."" the realtor said. He gestured for Ryan to come out, and once he was out of the crawlspace, the realtor pushed a different section of wall and the panel slid back into place. ""See?"" he said. ""Plus, the crawlspace is right up against the master bedroom, so if this guy gets up to any mischief in there you'll be able to hear him clear as day.""

""Mom, can we get this house, pleeeeeeaaaaaaasssssse?"" Ryan begged, tugging on my arm.

""I'm gonna have to think about it, Ryan."" I said. ""This is a big decision for Mommy.""

We finished up the house tour and left to visit a few others before heading back to our hometown. For the next few days Ryan went on and on about how cool the crawlspace was and all the ideas he had for what he could do with it. I had my concerns about it and decided to check a few other listings before making a decision. However, as time went on, the crawlspace house was looking like a better and better option. It was pretty cheap for its size, was by a lot of great schools, and it would mean I only had a twenty minute commute. When I told Ryan I'd decided to buy the house he practically jumped for joy.

Moving in took a while, but once we were settled we took a weekend to decorate the crawlspace for Ryan's enjoyment. I put up some fairy lights inside and he moved in a bunch of his books for him to read, along with setting down an old blanket to make things comfortable. Once we were done it was honestly pretty charming; I could see why Ryan had wanted it so bad. But then again, what kind of kid doesn't want a secret space all to themselves?

Things were pretty great for the first week. Ryan was adjusting well to his new school, and even told me he made a friend by the name of Evan. I was excited to see him take to his new surroundings, it'd been my main concern about moving. Things were going well at my new job too; it was the same company so all the systems and stuff were the same, and my coworkers were all really nice. The second week was the same as the first, but things began to be strange the second weekend we spent in the house.

It was a late Saturday afternoon. I was laying in bed, watching something on Netflix. Ryan was playing in his room. I just got done with an episode of my show and paused it so I could go downstairs and grab a snack. That's when I heard something.

""Yeah,"" Ryan's quiet voice said, ""school's been going alright.""

I paused. It seemed as if Ryan was inside the crawlspace, but who was he talking to? He didn't have a phone and mine was sitting on my nightstand.

""I made a friend, his name is Evan."" he said. ""I think you'd like him.""

I stood by the wall, not saying anything.

Ryan hadn't always been as active as he is now. When he was little he spent a lot of time inside and came up with an imaginary friend. It'd been a bit hard to watch as a parent. Sure, lots of kids come up with imaginary friends, but you can't help but feel like it's a failure on your part that your kid has no 'real' friends. I figured that maybe Ryan had brought this friend back to help with the move.

I walked over to his bedroom and saw him reading a comic book inside the crawlspace.

""Hey kiddo,"" I said, ""I'm about to go make dinner. After that do you want to do a movie night?""

Ryan perked up and smiled. ""Do I get to pick?"" He said.

I nodded.

Things were fine for the rest of the weekend, and I didn't notice anything weird with Ryan. He was struggling a bit in math class, but that was about it. Then Ryan asked him if he could invite his friend Evan over to play. I gave the go ahead, hoping it'd make him feel less lonely.

Evan came over the next Saturday, and his mom decided to tag along so that we could get the chance to talk. We sat in the kitchen and drank some coffee while the boys played upstairs. Evan's mom was named Samantha, and we were getting along just fine.

""So, what happened to the man of the house?"" She asked.

""Oh, we split up when Ryan was about 4."" I said. ""He didn't really want custody and I was more than happy to keep Ryan away from him, so it's just been us for a while.""

""Anyone else come along?""

""A few guys, but...I dunno. It's not that Ryan didn't like them or anything, it's just that none of them really clicked, you know?""

Samantha nodded. ""I feel ya. I thought that I wouldn't get with anybody before I met my wife. I did think about dating the guy who owned this house though.""

""Oh, you knew him?""

""You don't?""

""Well, I never got the chance to meet him. Everything was done through the agent. I think he already moved to a second property or something.""

""I wouldn't blame him after what happened.""

""What do you mean?""

""Well--""

That's when we both heard Ryan yelling upstairs.

""Hey, let me out!""

We both got up and went upstairs to see what the commotion was about. We both went into Ryan's room and found Evan with his hand on the button for the panel, and Ryan crawling out of the crawlspace.

""What are you two doing?"" Samantha said, hands on her hips.

""We were playing hide and seek,"" Evan explained, ""and Ryan went into his little hideout, and I closed the door just to mess with him a little bit.""

Samantha turned to me, as if expecting an explanation. I told her about the crawlspace and how the panel worked, and she then turned to Evan and told him off for doing something like locking Ryan in there.

""If you get up to something like that again,"" she said, ""We'll leave and you'll be grounded for two weeks, understand?""

""Yes, Mom."" Evan said.

""Good, now apologize to Ryan.""

""Sorry for locking you in there."" Evan said.

""It's OK."" Ryan said. ""It's not that scary, I just didn't want to be stuck in there.""

With that settled, me and Samantha headed back downstairs to continue our coffee and conversation.

""Sorry about that."" Samantha said. ""Evan's harmless, I promise, it's just that sometimes he doesn't get when something is a bit dangerous.""

""It's OK."" I said. ""i honestly should have told them to stay away from that thing.""

""Why's it there, anyway?"" Samantha asked.

'Oh, yeah, funny story. The last owner had this place custom made, and he had it built in for his kid so they'd have a little secret lair. You know how kids are.""

""Huh."" Samantha said. She took a long sip from her coffee. ""I wonder if that has anything to do with what happened.""

""What do you mean?""

""Well,"" she said, ""I knew the guy who lived here had a kid. You'd see him at school events, things like that. He had a daughter, about Ryan and Evan's age, but then one day she went missing.""

""Missing?""

""Yeah, apparently it was on a camping trip too."" She said. ""He went to go get something from a cooler and when he turned around she was just gone. They combed through that whole forest trying to find her, but nothing every turned up. Eventually the police investigated him for foul play, but there was no evidence that he did anything to her.""

""When did all this happen?""

""Oh, about a year ago, I think."" She said. ""The police got done investigating him about six months ago, so I guess he decided to just...get away from here.""

I looked down into my coffee. It was always rough, hearing about another parent going through something like that, because one horrible thought always floats to the top of your brain.

*What if something like that happens to my kid?*

""Don't worry."" Samantha said. ""I'm sure the house is fine and stuff, I just thought that you should know.""

""Thanks, Samantha, I appreciate the honesty.""

We moved onto lighter topics until it was time for Samantha and Evan to go home for dinner. I went upstairs and found the two boys sitting in the crawlspace together reading comics. It seemed a little cramped for the two of them, but they didn't seem to mind the tight space any. Evan pulled himself out and Ryan promised to see him again at school.

Later that night, I was getting ready for bed when I heard Ryan say something.

""See, I told you you'd like him."" There was a pause. ""Oh, I'm glad you like me too."" Ryan said.

I decided to be cheeky and lean down in front of where the crawlspace was. ""Yeah, you're both pretty alright kids.""

""Oh, hey Mom."" Ryan said. 

""Get to bed, Ryan."" I said. I heard Ryan shuffling on the other side of the wall. I turned off the lights and got in bed, and as I was drifting off I had a thought. 

*Why did Ryan sound surprised when I responded?*

  
The 'incident' with the crawlspace happened a week later. 

This'll sound strange, but I count myself lucky that I was out of work with a head cold when it happened. I was at home when I got a phone call from the school.

""Hello, is this Ryan's mom?"" A lady on the phone asked.

""This is she."" I said, my nose full of mucus.

""Are you sitting down?""

'I stood up and began to pace. ""Why do you ask?""

""OK, this'll be hard to explain, Miss, but something's happened with Ryan.""

""What's wrong?""

""He's gone missing. We need you to come in and discuss what's happened.""

My runny nose and cough were the furthest things from my mind. I got dressed and in my car in record time and drove like a madwoman over to the school. I stormed into the front office and gave the lady at the front desk a bit of a scare when I slammed my hand on her desk while she was working on her computer.

""I'm Ryan's mother."" I said as best as I could with my stuffy nose.

""Oh, yes, right this way, ma'am."" she said. She got up and unlocked a door behind her which lead to what seemed to be the administrative area of the school. I followed her down a long hallway until we got to the door to the principal's office. She knocked on the door. 

""Ryan's mother is here."" she said. 

The door opened from the inside, revealing the principal. He was an older gentleman, about sixty years old, with salt and pepper hair. 

""Hello, ma'am, I'm Principal Thorne."" he said, holding out his hand for me to shake. ""I'm sorry we're meeting like this.""

I shook his hand and stepped into the office. Inside there was also a security guard, a heavyset man with a large beard who was holding a laptop. I took a seat across the principal's desk and he sat behind it. 

""First of all, ma'am,"" he said, ""I'm terribly sorry about what's happened.""

""Where's Ryan?"" I said curtly.

""Well, that's what we're trying to figure out, but there are some...strange circumstances involved.""

""What do you mean?""

""Ferguson, if you could."" Thorne said, gesturing at the security guard. 

The security guard set his laptop down on the desk, opened it, and navigated his way through a few menus until he was in some kind of app that was connected through the school's security cameras. 

""Ok, so here's what we know."" Ferguson said. ""Around three hours ago, at 12:30, Ryan is in his math class with Miss Hayward.""

He enlarged one of the cameras. It showed a classroom full of young kids. I could see Ryan sitting right in the middle of them. A young woman drew shapes on a white board, trying to explain polygons or something like that. The timestamp showed that this footage was indeed from 12:30 that day.

""Now, Ryan asked to go to the restroom and Miss Hayward gave him permission.""

Sure enough, Ryan raised his hand. He and the teacher spoke for a bit, and then the teacher gave him a little hall pass and he left the classroom. 

Ferguson then swapped to another camera, showing the hall outside the classroom. Ryan walked outside and strolled down the hall for a bit until he found the restroom. Ferguson switched to another camera, this one closer to the restroom entrance, which clearly showed Ryan walking inside. Ferguson then hit fast forward on the video, skipping past five minutes. 

""Now, since Ryan took so long, Miss Hayward sent another kid to go and see what was wrong."" Ferguson explained. Sure enough, the footage showed another kid walking into the restroom. He stayed in there for about a minute before running back to the classroom. 

""According to that kid,"" Ferguson explained, ""Ryan wasn't inside of the restroom. Miss Hayward contacted me and the other security officers and we began searching the school.""

He switched between various angles, which showed him and a few other men in uniform checking classrooms and the halls for any sign of Ryan. According to the timestamps this search went on for two and a half hours. 

""That's when I had the thought to just go back and check the cameras,"" Ferguson said, ""and I found this.""

Ferguson switched back to the restroom entrance camera, rewound it back to when Ryan walked in, and then hit fast forward. The footage speed by, with only the occasional security officer or student passing by giving any hint that it wasn't a still image. He fast forwarded until the camera was caught up with the live feed. 

Ryan hadn't walked out of the bathroom at all.

""Now, we turned that restroom inside out."" Principal Thorne explained. ""The restrooms are designed to sit in the center of the school for ease of access and to make sure that a kid can't just, say, crawl out a window and skip school. To be frank, there is no way in or out of the restroom except through that entrance.""

""What are you saying?"" I said quietly.

""What I'm saying, ma'am, is...we just don't know where Ryan is.""

  
The police got called in. I gave them all the information they asked for, answered all of their questions, and was told I'd be contacted as soon as there was a development. I finally went home as the sun was setting. I weakly walked up the stairs and into my bedroom and flopped down on the bed. I closed my eyes and gave myself a moment to let the day's events catch up with me. 

Big mistake, because as soon as I stopped for a moment I felt the tears begin to run down my face. I took a moment to take some deep breaths. In the dead quiet after I exhaled, I heard something.

""Mommy...""

I shot up out of bed. That was Ryan's voice.

'Ryan?"" I said. ""Ryan where are you?""

""Mommy..."" 

I leaned down. It sounded like it was coming from the crawlspace. 

I decided screw it, if this was a psychotic break then I'd deal with it, but I had to know.

I ran around to Ryan's room and threw open the closet doors. I pressed the panel to open it. It slide away, and there he was.

He looked pale, like he'd been sick for days. His eyes were closed, and he was lightly tossing and turning as though he were having a bad dream. I gingerly reached inside and pulled him out, and once he was out of the crawlspace his eyes fluttered open.

""Mom....""

""I'm here, baby, I'm here."" I said. I held him tightly, as if he'd disappear again if I let go. ""You're safe now, you're safe.""

""Mommy,"" he said, his voice weak, ""my friend tried to take me.""

I set him down and looked him in the eye. ""Who tried to take you, sweetie?""

He pointed at the crawlspace. ""My friend. He lives in there.""

I looked at the opening to the crawlspace, and suddenly it all felt *wrong,* deeply wrong, like it shouldn't exist. I walked over and closed the panel. 

""It's OK, baby."" I said, hugging Ryan once more, ""he won't be able to hurt you.""

When I finally let go of him, I noticed he had something in his hand. 

""What do you have there, Ryan?"" I asked. 

He sheepishly handed the object to me. It was a small wooden slab painted a dark blue. 'Ms. Hayward's Class' was painted on it in yellow letters.

  
I called the police and informed them of the situation. They came by the house and tried to ask Ryan questions about what happened, but he never deviated from the same story he told me. He'd gone to the restroom and then 'his friend' had tried to take him, and then he woke up to me pulling him out of the crawlspace. 

I watched the officers as Ryan spoke to them, and I could see that they were realizing a few of the same things that I had. 

That a kid had somehow vanished into thin air when he shouldn't have been able to. 

That a kid had somehow then appeared in a crawlspace that could only be opened from the outside while his mother was home, and she'd never noticed. 

That said mother couldn't possibly be responsible because she'd never gone to the school to pick him up. 

I watched as the cops got more and more confused as they came to these realizations. Once they were done asking Ryan questions they told me that they'd contact me if there were any developments in the case, along with resources for child therapists in the area. 

Once they were gone I asked Ryan if he wanted to sleep with me that night, and he enthusiastically said yes. 

We both climbed into bed together, and once I was sure Ryan was asleep I grabbed my phone, turned on the flashlight and walked into his bedroom. I slid the panel aside and looked into the crawlspace. 

There was a small hole drilled into one of the walls, at about where eye level would be if Ryan was sitting inside the space. The hole should have opened up into my room. 

One small problem. 

I knew there wasn't a hole on my side of the wall. 

I walked around to my bedroom to double check.

No hole.

I walked back around and looked inside the crawlspace again.

Hole. 

I made my way into the crawlspace, slowly approaching the hole. I held my hand out over it. I could feel a hot draft coming through from the other side, wherever that was. I took a deep breath and put my eye up to the hole to look at the other side. 

I saw a single bloodshot eye staring back at me. Then I heard something, something that sounded like it was being whispered right into my ear by someone with rotten breath.

""*Give him back to me...""*

I got out of the crawlspace as fast as I could. I shut the panel behind me. Then I grabbed one of Ryan's long sleeved shirts, closed the closet door, and tied the doorknobs together with the shirt, all while saying a prayer that whatever that thing was would stay in there and never speak a word ever again. 

I got back into my bed with Ryan. I looked at him as he slept peacefully. It was the first time he'd looked relaxed all day. I held him tightly as I stared at the wall, the wall that somehow both had a hole and didn't, and I dared the thing I'd seen and heard to try and take my son away from me again.

  
It's been three days since then, and things have been tense since that night. I got all of Ryan's clothes out of the closet, keeping an eye on the panel as I did so, and put them all up in my own. I also got a bike lock and some zip ties and used them to keep the closet doors shut, and so far they haven't budged an inch. I'm trying my best to figure out how to get us both out of this house, but unfortunately a house isn't something you can just turn around and sell within three weeks. So far nothing else has happened with Ryan; he's been a little less active than usual, but I'm getting him a therapist and he's been sleeping in my bed every night so he doesn't have to worry about that...thing. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. I need to get us out of here, but that's gonna be easier said than done. 

What I do know is this.

No one messes with my kid while I'm around.

No one.

1jgy7wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuscleTwitch/comments/1jgy7wh/im_going_insane/,I’m going insane,"Around Tuesday this week, a muscle in my left arm started randomly twitching for short periods of time. At first, I ignored it. It’s happened before, went away and didn’t come back for a good while. However, this time, it kept coming back.

First time I tried to stop it, I just gave it a firm massage with my hands, and it’d go away. But it kept coming back.

Then, I was starting to get a little annoyed. When I’d notice the twitch, I’d grind that area of my arm against a corner, like the corner of my bed’s headrest or the corner of a wall, to really rub deep. Didn’t do jack.

By late Wednesday, I started getting irked. Usually it’s gone by now! So when I’d notice the twitch, I’d give my arm a firm shake, or even give it a quick punch. That seemed to do the trick, until it didn’t on Thursday.

By Thursday, I was getting pissed. It was SO distracting when I tried to do homework or draw, and it would come up every 5-30 minutes, so it was pretty frequent. By then, I started giving myself harder punches on the arm in hopes of doing something. Didn’t work.

Now comes Friday, and I genuinely feel myself getting angry when I feel my arm muscle twitching. I’ve began repeatedly, harshly punching myself in the arm even when it really starts to hurt, until it stops, just for it to start up again shortly after, leading me to get even more pissed and I just hit myself harder. I think I’ve gone and given myself a bruise, but I still punch it because jesus christ it’s getting on my nerves. 

How do people deal with this? When does it go away? I’ve been so focused on when this damn twitch comes about, I’ve noticed other muscles in my body gently twitching from time to time, but not to the extent of my arm. I haven’t had any coffee, haven’t worked out recently, I’ve been taking vitamins and drinking water (that’s all I really drink to be honest), but it’s still here. I don’t want to hurt myself anymore but I need this to STOP",1,1742610125.0,MuscleTwitch,1,1.0,False

I am mid 20s, F and I work remote so being close to a workplace / a commute isn’t a problem for me. In my daily life it’s really important for me to be able to take walks/ runs in nature or nice areas that are safe feeling/ where I don’t have to be on alert. I would also like to be 20-30 minute drive including traffic lol to city amenities like coffee shops, restaurants, drink spots, the beach, etc. but ideally I could be able to walk to a coffee shop. 
  What areas should I be looking in or targeting that fit that criteria for me? Thank you so much in advance!!!",2,1742610083.0,MovingToLosAngeles,3,1.0,False

1jgy6q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1jgy6q9/seeking_advice_on_navigating_competition_and/,Seeking Advice on Navigating Competition and Repositioning Our Business,"My wife and I launched our coffee and bakery trailer business in late October 2024. There is an established local coffee shop in town that has been operating since 2022. Unfortunately, we’ve received mixed signals from them, especially after they partnered with a new bakery and introduced drinks similar to ours. We’ve also noticed that when we post on social media, they tend to mimic our content, which is frustrating since we invest significant time and effort into creating unique offerings.

Since December, we haven’t been open due to the cold weather, and we also manage full-time jobs. Recently, we’ve been questioning whether our presence in town is truly sustainable, as it often feels like we are in direct competition with them. However, our customers have expressed a strong preference for our coffee over the café down the street, which reassures us that we have something special to offer.

To strengthen our brand and differentiate ourselves, we are considering a strategic shift—integrating more of our Hispanic culture into our drinks and bakery offerings while continuing to develop fun and unique beverage options that resonate with our clientele.

We’d love any advice on how to navigate competition in a small town and effectively reposition our business to highlight our cultural influence while maintaining and growing our customer base.",2,1742610015.0,Entrepreneur,2,1.0,False
1jgy6jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/6Perks/comments/1jgy6jk/trailblazer_gods_wanderlust/,Trailblazer God's Wanderlust,"Why, hello there. Lovely day for a stroll in the woods, isn't it? . . . You should know by now what this is, but let us have this moment of peace. Look up there. Beautiful, aren't they? Three birds. One's building a nest. Over there, isn't that river so beautiful. Nature really is wonderful, isn't it? But I've experienced it all before. I've explored this world top to bottom. I've seen every beautiful inch of this world, but I want to experience more. . . But even more so, I want to leave this world with a gift before my departure. As many other gods have, I am offering blessings. I ask for nothing in exchange. Please accept my offerings to you, my fellow explorers. My gifts belong to all those who wonder and wander. 

These are the essentials or the freebies. Accept them as you will. 

The Trail Provides: 
No matter where you go or what you do, you will find what you need to survive. You will find good food, clean water, warm shelter, and good company on your walks through life. This blessing works best when adventuring or experiencing new things. A life without new experiences is seldom one worth living. 

Trophy Room:
Welcome. . . I made this pocket dimension. A place where you can keep trophies of your adventures, experiences, and whatever else you want. It will self organize everything for you, and is always cozy and warm. Within, you can find a few amenities. Good food, cigars, and as much tea, coffee, or alcohol you can drink. None of this can leave the room, but it's here for you to enjoy your victories. 

Right to Wander:
It's a right provided by me, when the first human took their first breath. One that was squashed and removed from your history books by those who would prefer you stay put. This, I will no longer allow. This is a gurentee that you will never be contained. That you will never be held against your will. 

Now that we've gotten those out of the way, I will now offer you something more. . . Pick one of these, and I'll be off. 

The Call to Adventure:
Randomly throughout your life, you will receive letters, phone calls, or run into new people. Each one will offer you new experiences or adventures you can go on, usually for some kind of reward. These experiences can be anything from helping open a restaurant to something akin to Indiana Jones. Rewards made via these adventures will, at minimum, afford you a very comfortable life. There is no upper limit to the power of artifacts or experiences you can find. 

The Open Road is Seldom Lonely: 
You, and any companions you pick up on your journey will become ageless, but not immortal. Any blessings that they have are shared with you and the other members of your group. This does include blessings from the other gods, I'm sure they won't mind. This does not give you a copy of their blessings, mearly a glimmer of it (Think being able to access another person's item shop, or being able to paint mini-figures and still have them work for the blessing). This blessing can only share up to ten blessings in this way, but can hold up to one hundred normally. 

Following in the Footsteps of Gods:
Perhaps you have lofty ambitions? For you, I give this. Less a blessing, more a challenge. Experience everything. If you can experience the world as I have, every beautiful inch from top to bottom, then I will grant you the ultimate boon. A jumpchain. It is I who decides if you have experienced it in full, and it is I who makes the terms of the chain itself. It will follow all the basic rules of jumpchain, aside from these modifications. You will be using the Personal Reality Supplement and the Essential Body Mod. As a further addition, if you have companions because of someone from The Open Road is Seldom Lonely, you may take them along as companions into your chain. 

That is all from me. The Open Road calls. Take care, my friends. . . Oh, but before I go, tell me of what you will take! Do so, and I will give you this, as an extra token of my gratitude. 

The Trailblazer Sigil:
While rare, I have friends in many places. Presenting this sigil to them will show that you are one of my friends and can be trusted. . . Do be warned, using this puts you under the rules of xenia. ",8,1742609999.0,6Perks,4,1.0,False

I wanted to throw a bone to the folks over at Rocket City Dog Bar.

Got a dog? love beer? You’ll love it!
All smiles, the whole time! 

Located in the former Salty Nut on Clinton, a stones throw from Campus 805. All dogs are pre-registered and must have shot records documented before entry. One registered, you and the pooch are welcome anytime. $10 for a single visit, but month and yearly memberships are much cheaper.

Great beer and drink selections with local craft brews on tap as well as canned cocktails, coffee, and soft drinks.

Obviously not for everyone, but no dog lover will be disappointed. The owner is very friendly as is the staff. There is always a “Bark Ranger” with the doggos to make sure all are happy.
