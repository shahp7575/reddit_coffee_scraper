[Sei categorie di ciclisti secondo gli olandesi. A questi andrebbero aggiunti i cicloturisti, che spesso viaggiano in gruppo e hanno esigenze particolari rispetto a pendolari e ciclisti per svago.](https://preview.redd.it/bo7m7d4vybtd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e6943d54273594240bfbc4394f91c5c110b7cf2)

Quando si parla di ciclisti spesso molti fanno un calderone di ‘ciclisti 100% indisciplinati’ alimentando uno sciocco pregiudizio secondo cui chi va in bicicletta è un anarchico senza patente ([non è vero](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/10/11/i-ciclisti-guidano-meglio-lauto-e-hanno-meno-incidenti-degli-automobilisti-che-non-vanno-in-bici-accident-analysis-prevention-study/)) mentre l’automobilista è un disciplinato cultore della legge (e anche questo non è vero).

Entrambe le categorie commettono numerose infrazioni, con la differenza che chi guida un suv da 2,5 tonnellate è molto più pericoloso della stessa identica persona quando va in bicicletta. [Un’auto che a 50 km/h investe un pedone ha un impatto pari a circa cento ciclisti che vanno a 20 km/h](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/essere-investiti-da-unauto-a-50-km-h-e-come-essere-investiti-da-tutto-il-plotone-del-giro-ditalia/).

Il punto importante è che ci sono molte categorie di ciclisti, illustrate nell’immagine sopra, e cioè:

1. **Ciclista quotidiano.** È il ciclista, uomo o donna, che usa tutti i giorni la bici per andare al lavoro, a scuola e per fare commissioni familiari. Si va dall’impiegato che lavora dalle 9 alle 18 [all’agente di commercio](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/09/18/lagente-di-commercio-che-fa-50-km-ogni-giorno-in-bicicletta-elettrica/) che visita numerosi clienti tutti i giorni, dallo studente all’insegnante.
2. **Ciclista sportivo.** È il ciclista che usa la bicicletta per allenamento sportivo, professionale, semiprofessionale o amatoriale, ma anche per esplorare i dintorni della sua città, facendo spesso centinaia di km alla settimana. Di questa categoria fanno parte anche i paraciclisti che si allenano con biciclette speciali. Il codice della strada italiano è particolarmente impietoso nei suoi confronti, con una normativa particolarmente confusa sia a proposito dei gruppi, sia a proposito delle piste ciclabili.
3. **Ciclista del tempo libero.** Chi usa la bici per fare un giro, per andare al caffè, uscire la sera o passare un pomeriggio festivo, tanto nella propria città quanto in vacanza
4. **Ciclista timoroso.** È il ciclista che vuole circolare in sicurezza e ha bisogno di segnaletica chiara e intersezioni sicure. È il ciclista che più facilmente rinuncia alla bicicletta se pensa di essere in una situazione di pericolo. Spesso le donne preferiscono non usare la bicicletta se pensano che gli automobilisti siano troppo pericolosi e aggressivi. Molti italiani vorrebbero usare la bicicletta per lavoro o per commissioni, ma non lo fa perché ha paura del traffico.
5. **Ciclista vulnerabile.** Si tratta principalmente di bambini, [disabili](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/ma-e-gli-anziani-e-i-disabili-come-fanno-ad-andare-in-bicicletta/) con bici a due o tre ruote, e [anziani](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/09/07/perche-tutti-tutelano-gli-anziani-costretti-a-usare-lauto-per-andare-in-farmacia-o-in-parrocchia-ma-nessuno-tutela-gli-anziani-in-bicicletta/), sempre con bici a due o tre ruote. Hanno bisogno di percorsi particolarmente sicuri, e particolare rispetto da parte degli utenti motorizzati.
6. **Corrieri in bici.** Sono persone che lavorano in bici per fare consegne o per trasportare la propria attrezzatura: corrieri, fattorini, postini, artigiani in bicicletta. Da notare che, mentre i corrieri con furgone quando parcheggiano sui marciapiedi, in doppia fila o sulle piste ciclabili sono sempre giustificati con ‘solo cinque minuti, sto lavorando’, i corrieri in bici vengono spesso etichettati come delinquenti che non rispettano il codice della strada. Come mai questo doppio standard?
7. **I** **cicloturisti**. Categoria non prevista nell’illustrazione sopra, sta diventando sempre più importante in Europa anche per il giro d’affari che comincia a muovere: in Europa più del settore delle crociere, per esempio. I cicloturisti viaggiano spesso in gruppo, hanno spesso bisogno di usare anche il treno, e hanno bisogno di servizi e assistenza lungo la strada. Fortunatamente molti alberghi si stanno attrezzando per servire al meglio questo tipo di clientela che, in proporzione, spende di più e pesa di meno sul territorio rispetto agli ingombranti turisti in automobile. [I cicloturisti si suddividono a loro volta in almeno tre categorie](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2021/04/11/ci-sono-3-tipi-di-cicloturisti-e-molti-albergatori-non-lo-sanno-perdendo-clienti/).

È evidente che queste sette categorie di ciclisti hanno caratteristiche particolari e hanno bisogno di una attenzione specifica da parte delle amministrazioni pubbliche, delle aziende, delle scuole e anche un’attenzione particolare da parte di chi guida mezzi motore. I ciclisti, per il codice della strada, sono utenti vulnerabili, come pedoni e disabili (articolo 3).

È altrettanto evidente che è del tutto inutile e anche stupido dipingere sempre i ciclisti come anarchici che non rispettano il codice della strada. Nessuna delle categorie di utenti della strada rispetta tutte le norme: gli automobilisti fanno le loro infrazioni, i motociclisti le loro infrazioni, i pedoni le loro infrazioni e i ciclisti le loro infrazioni. Non è con l’invito astratto a rispettare il codice della strada che si riducono gli incidenti, ma riprogettando le strade, realizzando più piste ciclabili e potenziando i mezzi pubblici.

È invece utile progettare strade sicure anche per queste categorie di ciclisti, che pesano meno su ambiente e territorio ma portano più benessere e una mobilità migliore.

Quando una città è progettata per bambini, pedoni, ciclisti è meglio per tutti, compresi gli automobilisti. Quando una città è progettata prioritariamente per l’automobile, con autostrade urbane e parcheggi dappertutto, è peggio per tutti, compresi gli automobilisti.",1,1728792218.0,ciclismourbano,0,1.0,False

1g2he7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheKameena/comments/1g2he7k/aitk_for_basically_cheating_on_my_husband/,AITK for basically cheating on my Husband ,"I need to get this out, and I’m not sure if I’m looking for judgment or understanding. My life looks perfect from the outside—a wealthy, powerful husband, a beautiful home, everything anyone could want. But what no one sees is how controlled I am. He controls every aspect of my life, treating me like some doll he can mold into his perfect vision of a wife.He’s a powerful man, and he rules our home like he runs his business with total control. He decides where I go, who I can talk to, even what lipstick I’m allowed to wear. For years, I convinced myself that I was okay with it, that this was what love looked like. But deep down, I was suffocating.

For a while, I thought this was normal, that this was just what marriage was. But deep down, I felt like I was suffocating, locked in a cage made of his rules. I didn’t even realize how desperate I was for something,anything different until I met him.

It all changed at one of his success parties. He had just closed a massive deal, and the party was in full swing, filled with his colleagues, business partners, and a few other powerful men from the city. I was wearing the dress he picked out for me, greeting his friends with a polite smile, playing the role of the perfect wife, as always.

And then I saw him. He wasn’t one of the usual business types—no slick suit or forced charm. He was rougher around the edges, with a presence that made me feel something stir inside. I noticed him watching me, but it wasn’t like the way my husband’s friends would stare, trying to undress me with their eyes. No, his gaze was different—deeper, darker, like he could see right through the facade I’d been putting up for years.

He walked up to me, and without hesitation, said, “You don’t belong to him. I can see it in your eyes.” His voice was low, smooth, but commanding.

I should’ve walked away. I should’ve ignored him. But I couldn’t. I took his number, and later that night, I texted him. My heart was racing, but for the first time in a long time, I felt alive. More alive than I ever had under my husband’s suffocating control.

We started meeting in secret. At first, it was just coffee, small conversations where he’d ask questions my husband never bothered to—about my thoughts, my desires, the things I craved but could never admit. And then it escalated. The first time we went to his apartment, I was trembling, torn between guilt and something darker. 

He stripped me of the perfect, obedient wife facade that my husband had created, seeing me for who I really was. He didn’t demand submission like my husband did; instead, he showed me how giving myself to him could be empowering. It was erotic, the way he took control, but in a way that made me feel like I had never felt before—desired, seen, and free in my own surrender.

His touch wasn’t soft or delicate. It was raw, passionate, filled with a need that mirrored my own. He pushed me past boundaries I didn’t know I had, and instead of feeling ashamed, I felt powerful. Every time we met, he took me deeper into a world of desire, awakening things inside me that had been buried under years of control and repression.

The way he would command me with just a glance, the way my body responded to him—it was intoxicating. With him, I wasn’t the polished, perfect wife who existed for my husband’s image. I was something else—wild, untamed. And the more I gave in to him, the more I realized how much I had been craving this.

I still go home to my husband, still play the role of the obedient, well-kept wife. But every time I’m with my lover, I feel more alive than ever before. It’s like I’ve discovered a part of myself that I didn’t even know existed, a dark, erotic side that has nothing to do with the life my husband built for me.

When I’m with my lover, I’m free. I give myself to him completely, not because he demands it, but because I want to. And in that submission, I’ve found something my husband could never give me—control over my own desires, over my own body. With every secret encounter, I fall deeper into this new, and I can’t bring myself to stop.

So, here I am, asking—am I wrong for feeling this way? For craving this? Or am I finally waking up to what I’ve been missing all along?",0,1728792117.0,AmItheKameena,5,0.25,False
1g2hdlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1g2hdlk/questions_about_cpap_and_sleep_apnea/,Questions about cpap and sleep apnea.,"So I've had an on going issue or issues with my heart and blood flow. More specifically,  randomly my bp would drop unexpectedly and I would almost black out or I would black out. Never figured out what would cause it. I've seen multiple doctors that have checked and rolled out many things.  This has happened for 20+ years. At first it was maybe once a year. Then over time it increased and started experiencing more and more symptoms but not all at once. Mainly dizziness & lightheadedness. Sometimes I would sweat bullets first then after blacking out or almost blacking out I would instantly freeze. Over the years the dizziness increased to a few times a year, to eventually at least once a month then a couple times a month. Usually occurred in the morning after getting lunch ready and coffee.  But then the lightheadedness started occurring at work while running my route in my work truck. Eventually I started experiencing an inability to focus while driving and it only got worse.  A few years ago, I was running my route an hour away. It was 5am and started getting dizzy and itching all over,  I began sweating again when it was 35 degrees out. Made it to my next stop and after a few minutes almost blacked out. I managed to lay down on wet grass next to my truck. After 10 minutes it wasn't going away like it usually does.  Had to call for an ambulance. After getting me into the back he said my BP dropped extremely low. After it started coming up he had me sit up slowly and it crashed immediately. I almost blacked out again. He recommended I go to the ER, so I did.  After multiple IVs and running tests I started turning bright red and my limbs were swelling. They thought I was having an allergic reaction. Administered more meds and after 6 hours no real answers but stabilized and sent home and told to see my primary care doctor for more tests.  Even saw an allergist with no answers.  My doctor put me on bp medicine to keep it level.  After a few years. The episodes got worse. Eventually got disability through work approved. Finally started seeing more specialists. 
I heard dehydration, anemia, low magnesium loss of things that were treated but didn't help the dizziness and blackouts they continued.  Eventually started having chest pressure and pain along with numbness and tingling in hands and feet and felt like I wasnt getting enough oxygen. Cardiologist couldn't find anything wrong even after doing a loop recorder implant and monitoring it. They even stopped the bp medicine to rule it out.  pulmonologist said I had asthma even though it wrote it on my paperwork before hand. Neurologist suggested carpal tunnel but never went back to test. Specialists were going to send me back to work with no answers.  Also was experiencing performance problems in bed, wife was not happy. BP would drop after getting worked up and mood would be gone instantly.  Got referred to another cardiologist and after getting a tilt test scheduled he was able to trigger an episode immediately. After going over all tests results he said the pills and blood pressure do go hand on hand but works independently as well.  My heart is pumping normally but for some reason randomly the blood will not go back to my heart.  My heart will continue pumping normally, pumping out the residual that usually remains in the heart.  So the receptors detect this and sends signals to the brain to fix it. Which in turns seems signals to black out. Basically going horizontal can help get the blood back. He said the blood not returning is pooling up causing my bp to drop and not circulating enough oxygen causing me to feel like I'm out of breath. After testing negative for sleep apnea a year prior the pulmonologist sent a home test with me and I woke up choking on acid reflux(I am on medicine for it), but he said oh failed the home test and needed a cpap. So I got fitted for one and started using it. It started out rough until they got me a mask that worked.  After being forced to use it for several weeks I kept checking the app. 

Can someone explain to me what they look for?

 I tried to read about it online and from what I could tell it said there are several stages or whatever.  1 to 5 events( not to concerning) per hour,  5 to 10, or severe 10 to 15.  

If someone has 1 to 5 events per hour, how does it show on the app? Does 1 event say 1 or is it .1 events and does 5 events show as 5 or .5.

Also I tend yawn alot while trying to fall asleep, so when I yawn I'm basically holding my breath.  Can this be detected as an event on the machine?

My point is since I got a mask that works some times it'll say .3 events or .6 events but never a solid 1 or 2. Not since that first mask that sucked.

Ive even had a solid 0 events. Also I get severe stomach cramps consistently almost everyday. 

I'm just concerned. I know if someone needs it and don't use it, it could be dangerous.  But,  also if someone is using one that doesn't need it, it could be dangerous for them as well. 

Or Should I just get in for another hospital test overnight, or just see another pulmonologist to look at my reports?

Any help would be appreciated thanks. 

Sorry it's so long, no I didn't proof read for errors. I just need answers no one can figure out what's going on.  Cardiologist did say I was probably just born this way and it probably isn't hereditary.
Oh and I found out a cousin a few years younger than me is on her 2 loop recorder with the same issues. Her doctors can't figure anything out either.

We go through big argument phases but always get through it but I still have anxiety that we won’t every time 😅

My girlfriend always borrows her mums clothes but she always asks first. Recently we went on a week long camping trip and when we came back my gf realised that a lot of her stuff from her desk was missing like perfume etc. she found it in her mums room and got a little upset but didn’t say much about it. 

Today my gf is working a full day and I was home with her parents and they were going out for a coffee and her mum was wearing my gf FAVOURITE sweater. And I asked her did you tell *insert daughters name* and she got all defensive and said “no why should I ask she knows I wear it”

So I just messaged my gf “hey did yk your mum is wearing that sweater” and she got so upset and said no wtf omg I hate her she’s so selfish etc 

Not even 5 mins later the mum yells at me saying “what did she say?!” Like she knew that I messaged my gf I didn’t say anything though and they left for coffee.

Now the mum has completely cracked it with me saying stuff like “you didn’t have to tell her I was going to go see her she would’ve seen it” but she didn’t tell me she was going to see her at the cafe. And she is saying stuff like “why did you tell her I don’t have to tell you where I’m going” and I said i don’t want to fight I just think you should ask from now on because she always asks before taking your clothes. And she says “I’m not materialistic I don’t care about that stuff” and I said I know but your daughter does a lot and you know that and she just hung up on me.

Now I’m making this post bc I feel really bad and guilty bc both my gf and her mum are extremely upset and I’m just here like 😀 blaring KORN in my ears trying to forget everything.",1,1728790804.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

I wanted someone to sext he wanted someone to hook up with in person but he wasn’t looking for a relationship, he felt weird talking to me. I said that’s fine I just need someone to sext and he was very good at it, I pointed out he was the one doing all the talking.. 

Fast forward 2 months and we text everyday, he leaves voice memos often, talk on the phone and Facetime. If I ask for more attention he gives it. He’s still consistent in checking all the boxes. The sexting and naughty talk isn’t as often. He keeps saying he’ll help with costs to come see him…he can only see me for a few hours for one day.. Fine. He says he’ll bring me a gift. We pick out the dates, he moves meetings around. Few more weeks go by, I leave a voice memo saying I’m done waiting, help me plan this or I’m done talking. He calls immediately, within two hours he has me a hotel… he goes to work late. Three days, two nights. Now he says he will see me on day two and day three. A few days before the trip he asks what time my plane lands… he will be there a few hours after that. We count down the days, we plan what we will do. I go there, he’s better in person. We bang, it was amazing, afterwards he orders us food for our “date”. The next day is for me to explore the city. I tell him to bring me a gift like he said he would. The third day he sees me first thing in the morning, brings me breakfast and coffee… and a gift. He runs a business… people could no longer cover him… business started late that day.. 

It’s now been just over 4 months… Still checking all the boxes, we talk on the phone regularly. We share things about our lives, we are friends at this point. When I send pics or videos instead of saying the usual hot, sexy, now he says he loves them. That’s his go to word now… His language has changed… He’s a big support in my life, encouraging, he always knows what to say. I almost try to sabotage it by being too needy, by showing more of myself. He becomes more attentive…. I figured out he was lying about something dumb, I texted him and said this is dumb talking to you is optional I’m not dealing with this. He called immediately, apologized, he says he should have saw me all 3 days. I talked to him the other day trying to figure out what I am to him, asking if he saw women close to him, which I would understand… I’m trying to like him less… he said no, we had a special bond, I add color to his life, I make his life 3D. I’m in love with him, it’s ruining my life… if I have a bad day I want to talk to him, if I have a good day, I want to share it with him. All I want to do is be with him. I don’t want to give him up.

I've seen a lot of advice that is basically 'you should hook the reader in the first 1-5 pages' or smth.

What?? I have read the Alchemist and I couldn't give half a shit about the boy (I even forgot his name) even by the 20th page.

I am reading before the coffee gets cold 1 (i've ordered the rest), and although I am enjoying it, I did not care about the first and second individual in the first 1-5 pages. I read it because of 'word of mouth' and I found the concept (only) somewhat interesting.

See, in the BCGC book, the conflict was in the first some pages but it wasn't very fast paced and didn't exactly 'hook' me or 'make me care'. Idk man it doesn't seem like that books that actually do well try to go for a strong hook on the first few pages. Like in the BCGC book, the story developed pretty slowly and I enjoyed it, there was no hook, I knew the gist of what was going to happen and the hook was... nothing tbh. In fact, I only started caring by like the last 10 pages of the first chapter, so after 40-ish pages, and it's more like the climax of the first chapter made me care more about everything that had happened.

The first 40 pages were like uhhh ig I am reading this 'bestseller', then I was like hmmm okay Ig I know what's gonna happen, and only after reading the last pages was I like 'Awww this was a nice story, I need more.'

Maybe I've misinterpreted the two books, in which case please tell me what I interpreted wrong :D

Also I've read a lot of books and most of the time, there isn't a hook in the first few pages. Maybe it's just harder for me to get hooked which is why I don't see 'the hook'.",9,1728789245.0,writing,24,0.66,False

He lunged at us, he bandages whipping me in the eye. The rawness of his energy defying logic. Then came the blow to my head. It was sudden, disorienting. I stumbled backwards, blood trickling down and pooling in my collar. Yuri laughed louder, manic glee.  Pleased he sat down delighted as he resumed his grotesque fixation on his wounds.

“This isn’t normal,” I gasped, clutching my head. “He’s unstoppable!”

“Just..we will give him a higher dosage,” she insisted, the color drained from her face. “He has to sleep.”

This time we did it; we sedated him. We managed to subdue him, yet his evil lingered like a ghost from his lips, taunting us from the camera.  At last, after what felt like an eternity, his body surrendered to unconsciousness—sadly something about it felt like the calm before an unimaginable storm.

Daylight had left, darkness settling over the ward. My head throbbed, but my mind raced, but I decided now was a good time for my break.  There was something unexplainable within Yuri; he was different from the other patients we’d dealt with. Something primal stirred in the air between us, a heavy energy that suffocated life.

Later that night, I returned to the monitor, my fingers trembled as I prepared to check on him one last time before the shift change. But the screen was black. I squinted, the absence of light more menacing than illumination. Sarah shared a look of confusion, the silence empty around us, thick as fog.

As if responding to a conjuring, Yuri’s face appeared suddenly smack on the screen, bleached by moonlight through the window curtains he was hiding behind, an apparition in zero visibility. He was staring directly at the camera, his charred grin threatening us.

“Hello,” he rasped tapping the monitor, a sound that echoes in my mind still to this day.  In that instant, my senses shattered—what if I was the one being held captive.

“Do you feel it?” he whispered, his voice syrupy and slick. “The sweet isolation? The freedom of everything gone?”

My vision tunneled. I could no longer discern sanity.  It was then I realized he'd set fire to the ward.  I could smell it.  Would walls confine me?  Would the fires burn us all down? 

""You will be free soon,"" Yuri screamed waving flint rocks and matches in his hands ""You will release your true self. Now!"" he wailed with his bandages falling around him, exposing all his wounds to the growing flames curling up around him.  I was aware of it all but frozen, paralyzed—the fire stirring, the delirious chortles of flames rising up the curtains.  Worst of all, the flames - they beckoned me, they called me to join him, to dance in dark abandon with him.

Sarah’s eyes glazed over at me.  Her breath hitched. Dread thickened with the smoke rising, choking us. I reached for the door, but matches spilled out of Sarah's pockets all over the corridor. Those sticks on the floor bound me tightly as Yuri had.  

""Why,"" I screamed but Sarah ran out the exit.  Never to be found again.  She never did return back to work.

Yuri fills my nightmares.  I see him watching me. I feel him pulling me to join him - my humanity was stripped bare of me that day. I am in that moment, among the chaos and echoes, and the irony blossoms. My own sanity went up in smoke that day. ",1,1728789184.0,Horror_stories,0,1.0,False

1g2gih2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1g2gih2/bro_has_a_gf_i_realise_mum_is_a_narcissist/,"Bro has a GF, I realise Mum is a narcissist","I think I've posted here about my Mum before. Whatever. It's always the same problems with her, but now it's because my 26y.o brother has a girlfriend (26).

Bro and GF have been together for a few months now, and they seem to be good together. I don't live with the family any more (thank goodness!); Bro lives with Mum and Dad in Bro's house, and hopefully early next year or earlier Mum and Dad will be able to move out into the new place they're building in the country. 

My brother had been doing rough mentally for a while; quietly depressed and feeling dull and stuck. One day a friend of his mentions that they know a girl he might like to meet, so Bro organises a meet-up for coffee with her and seven months later they're still together and their relationship seems quite healthy. She lives with her own family, but stays over at Bro's place a few days a week whenever they can. I've met GF and talked with her alone, and I like her and think they are good together. They're not 'madly in love' but you can see a quiet compassion and connection between each other that I think is better than any public displays of affection. And of course my Bro's mental health has steadily improved.

Everything would be great and dandy if it wasn't for my parents, more specifically my Mother. I won't go into detail about every incident because I really can't be bothered, but suffice to say Mum has made judgements about GF based entirely on the limited amount she sees GF and her own outdated and biased opinions and values. This is ranging from weight, diet, exercise, manners, work, personality, mental health, plus more I haven't heard. These judgements flow to my brother, who was once 'mature for his age' and is now 'emotionally immature' based on the simple fact he is honest with GF and tells her if our parents have talked about her. You may not agree with that, but Bro and GF agreed with each other to be honest and are following through on that agreement. 

The relationship between my parents and my brother/GF has deteriorated, especially between Mum and GF. What angers me most is that my mother can not see where she's done wrong! I'm not saying GF is perfect, but at least she can take feedback of her behaviour well and acknowledge when she has acted poorly. But my Mum cannot, she is always right, always the victim, always the one who is treated harshly and incorrectly judged. 

I have tried to gently guide my Mum to seeing GF and Bro's side, but there is no such thing as introspection or self awareness for her. Any attempt to correct her behaviour is met with impenetrable resistance, and trying to force the issue only leads to her leaving or deflecting or having an emotional outburst to make you feel sorry for her again. 

I currently feel like the bridge between these two parties, the eldest daughter trying to keep the family together and get people to just talk to each other and LISTEN. But even then...I'm not trying too hard. Long ago I realised my Mum cannot learn, grow, or change, and the only way for things to 'improve' is if GF and Bro let themselves become doormats to Mum's feelings; they won't do that. Either they'll stick to their truth and the relationship will get worse until they cut Mum out of their lives all together, or they do the same that I have and become emotionally distant while staying friendly and polite on the surface. 

I hope the relationship between Dad and Bro doesn't deteriorate the same way; they've been very close for many years and helped each other get through Mum's crappy behaviour after I moved out. I think they can, so long as Dad doesn't get sucked into 'Mum's side' too deep. He has grown and matured in the nearly 30 years I've been alive so it's possible. Mum on the other hand; I've written her off. She's a lost cause, you can only redirect and pacify her to keep the peace. 

I don't like to toss around labels for people's behaviour, but I'm ready after all this time to call my own mother a narcissist. It explains so much...yet I wish it didn't. It's almost ironic that Mum says she thinks Bro and GF will stay together and eventually be partners, but at the same time has 'given up' on trying to be nice to GF and make the relationship between them work. She blames my Bro's honesty for this saying it's either completely his fault or ""50%"" alternatively. I asked her several times if Mum is sure there's no chance at repairing the relationship between herself and Bro's GF, and ach time she was firmly in the 'no chance, damage is done, I've given up' camp.

I hope in a few months I'm not posting here again about how my brother and my mother don't talk to each other any more.

I'm gonna do my best to describe everything but there's just so much

Idk if I have abilities or not or something but here are my reasons 

1. I talked to my mom's dead brother in 2nd grade, he stated his name and everything in school, I could see him, hear him and talk to him 

(this only happened once and I was extremely shy and never wanted to talk to anyone and for some reason walked up to him and stated my name, ever since then I was never shy again)

2. I've seen ghost throughout my entire life up until 6th grade, everything seems to have stopped, idk if I'm losing what I had or if I was too imaginative but other paranormal stuff has happened since then

3. We took a test for instruction following in 2nd grade, it's not one of those things teachers are forced to give out or even recommend by the school, in 6th grade I had a nagging feeling we were going to take it again so much so to the point of annoyance but by the next week that paper was on my desk 

4. Now in high school someone showed me a picture of a drink, he said it was tea, I didn't care cuz I was just trying to do my work, but all of a sudden I smell a mass amount of coffee, then I told him wow I smell loads of coffee, he says he doesn't smell coffee, then he scrolls down to read on the drink where he discovers that it's not tea, it's actually coffee! 

This means I've talked to ghost, heard ghost, seen ghost throughout life, predicted the future and I've also seen some crazy stuff like shadow people but I just woke up so I thought it was my brother so I yelled at the thing to go to bed, only to realize when I woke up that it wasn't even human, it was a shadowy figer with big white eyes, I went super close to it when I thought it was my little bro hiding under his bed, but clearly since I just woke up I didn't notice the two bright big circle eyes 

(WHAT THE HECK DOES THIS MEAN)
 (it never happened again)

I try to make sense of this, is it random, am I just making connections that arn't real, am I hullisinative, but like how many coincidences does it take, but at the same time the idea to be ""smelling the future"" sounds so dumb

 Also psychics only see ghosts so what am I supposed to be?!!

Normally, I would cough to cover up a fart, but during COVID, I changed tactics. I would now fart to cover up a cough.

After months of lockdown, I stopped caring about what others thought of me.  I was no longer worried about judgment. I discovered a newfound freedom in embracing my fetishes and natural bodily functions. My ass was free to pass gas.

The world had changed, and so had I. I was no longer the shy person who held back; after all, it's better to let it all out than to keep everything bottled up—unless, of course, you're giving or selling the fart bottle to someone.

[https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68401959/escue-v-ishbia/](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68401959/escue-v-ishbia/)

For this shit show, Brandy R. McMillion and David R. Grand play the part of Judge Harry and are entertaining the idea that UWMC stacked and packed GOSM by 2 billion, maybe more or less. The comedy part starts here, with non-specific damages that sort of remind me of a plaintiff saying, “Hey Harry, let me throw some shit on your wall in your courtroom and see if it sticks.”

But hey, I try impulsively to make sense of what people are saying. I mean, my remodeling work is done and I got nothing better to do other than sit back, drink coffee, and eat popcorn.

So, eagerly I crunched the numbers to see what GOSM was, and is for the entire period, and what 2 billion is in terms of GOSM.

[GOSM by Quarter, Totals for all, and 2b in GOSM is](https://preview.redd.it/mdwwuymvmfud1.png?width=337&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7070001bbf61229ceaf3cab27c61674b15f0210)

  
As stated, its the 86 bp in brilliant yellow minus the 45 bp in alleged ill-gotten gain that leads to one of the punch lines in this sitcom; i.e., **41 bps is normal** and the total tax-payer monies wasted to host the argument in court.

**How does that break down?**

* Sales profit from the Mortgage sold to a GSE. (15.5bp mean for all periods)
* 2024Q2 representative production loan expense of 14 bp (Credit check, appraisal, title, survey)

Having accounted for 29.5, that leaves 11.5 bp for wages on 8,000 people.

**What does that look like?**

**440,601,334,000 Total Originations x 0.00115 (GOSM, decimal form) / 8.000 employees / 3 years / 52 weeks / 40 hours = $10.15 per hour including benefits, with some higher, some lower.**

**Summary:**

The court continues to entertain the idea that plaintiffs are on to something that is impossible from the numbers given.  Unknown to Harry the lawyers are battling for Redactions -- ""Should they stay or should they go"", matters of court record to which can only advantage UWMC if they stay but damning for BSF and Hunter either way.  But the joke ultimately is on Harry, for if these records (redacted or not) and the shit show that is being documented goes to a counter suit, Harry's career would be in jeopardy for even considering the case to have merit, waste of tax-payer monies, and failure to consider the injured are the investors.

I'm a 22 year old make student. This year is the 6th I'll be living as a university student, and in spite of that, it's only the first one during which I'll be employed. It's nothing fancy, just a 12h/week part time job at a local mcdonalds. I love the job, coworkers and management, but that's not the point.

Or perhaps it kind of is, given I've entered the workforce in a way and I'm loving it. I'm sure the real world is full of jobs where people aren't douchebags, work properly, and management rewards efforts appropriately. Surely that's how it is, right. Right? :(

After working for a month I got my first paycheck. Again, nothing fancy, just 750€ for my troubles of working quite a few extra hours (I was supposed to earn 480).  
Now: up until this point, I had to rely on my parents giving me money every month to pay for my uni dorm rent and groceries. It was more than enough to the point where I could save money every month and eventually buy a brand new gaming PC, games, peripherals, you name them. It felt like heaven. I never spent money on restaurants (except the od fast food here and there) or clothes.

Until now. I've started buying new clothes for the first time since I've been free to spend my money however I want. Boxer shorts, socks, even jeans - lord knows I needed those three brand new jeans that actually fit me and don't have holes in them - ... and a pair of boots. I'm currently looking at getting a brand new pair of mountain/winter boots so my feet will stay warm this winter. I live in France, so it's not like I need Greenland levels of thermal protection for my toes, here, but the idea of having weather-appropriate shoes that look and feel nice (I really like the idea of wearing boots) now sounds much more appealing than it used to. I'm even thinking of getting new sweaters because I only have a couple of them right now, even though they're admittedly high quality sweaters I got as gifts.

I feel old. I've told a few friends of mine about this who are a few years younger than me and they don't get this sudden shift either because I've never been about fashion in any way. I don't think I am, it's all about having clothes that fit me now that I'm much heavier than I used to be (went from around 90kg 5-6 years ago to 105kg today. I know I need to exercise and such, no need to tell me about it, I'm trying to take steps towards that). Having jeans that fit me properly feels heavenly. Having underwear that doesn't have holes everywhere feels awesome.

I feel old. I feel like I'm leaving my teenage self behind. I'm not quite ready for the coffee and nicotine addiction that most of my peers seem to have (I sure hope I'll never try cigarettes), so this is all pretty scary.

I realized that many people settle down out of obligation or comfort, simply because they’ve been together for so long. But deep down, they might not be happy at all. A long relationship doesn’t automatically mean it’s a good one. True happiness comes from genuine emotional connections and mutual respect. It’s a reminder that a healthy relationship should bring joy and encourage growth, not just serve as a memory of what it once was.

As one Redditor mentioned in a comment, “The years you have spent together are nothing compared to the coming years you might suffer if you choose to stay. The sunk cost fallacy isn’t worth it.”",10,1728787711.0,CasualPH,1,0.86,False

She has been like a sister to me ever since we have met each other and has always been by each others side all the time. One problem was that when we grew closer and got used to each other Marie starts getting more and more protective of me.

For example she would turn down everyone that I talked with and would always make a big fit about it saying that I don't hang out with her often and would cry about it in hopes she gets my attention. She would also compare me to other beautiful people and start body shaming me saying I eat too much or I am trying to outshine her by being skinny so I have to eat more.

Another problem was there was no way I could talk to other people because she was in all of my classes.

When 10th grade was over, Marie went on a vacation with her family to Florida to visit her grandparents. I never felt so happy in my life. All the weight of pain and depression lifted from my shoulders.

One day while driving to my local coffee shop I saw this guy Jay (M,17y) who was at my school going to the coffee shop I was going to too. We had talked to each other several times but always get interrupted by Marie because of her protective behavior so we never talked that much.

I decided to invite him over to my table because the table was empty and I was in a good mood that day. He immediately came over to my table and we had a good time and a good laugh, we also exchanged numbers considering the fact that my contacts are only my mom, dad, and ofc, Marie, so I was really happy I have someone to talk to over the summer while Marie was gone.

After that day, me and Jay would constantly talk to each other and have dates constantly, to the point he asked to be his girlfriend forever. I ofc said yes.

Summer break was over and 11th grade started and unfortunately Marie was back to school happy to see me and for reason, that day was also a good day for me so I told her how me and Jay are officially dating. After I said those words, she immediately starts crying saying she never agreed to make me go on a date and get a boyfriend. I told her to suck it up because she needs to learn to let me live my life and let her understand that she needs to be kind to others too.

She immediately calls me a fat ass and a bitch while also crying and screaming while also hitting me hard to the point where at some parts I start bleeding or bruising. All the teachers were dragging her away.

After that I never heard a word of Marie ever again and eventually changed my entire schedule so I wouldn't have any classes with her anymore. But for some reason everyone kept telling me Marie is stalking me outside of school and in the school.

I confronted Marie about it and she said many uncanny things that I don't want to say, but I can tell you they were life threatening and disturbing. I told her if she doesn't stop I will call the cops on her and she will be taken away for good. She said that she was going to take me somewhere dark and scary while I was sleeping.

I felt so creeped out that I confronted my parents about the situation and that they were going to call the principal and the cops on her. I felt so bad and ended crying for hours, potentially begging my parents to not call them. They didn't call the cops but they told the principal which immediately expelled her from the district and the school.

I'm glad she's gone but rumors say that she was sent to the mental hospital for her mental health because it was affecting her parents too. So AITA?",1,1728787330.0,u_Helpful_Amphibian_41,0,1.0,False

Went to my shop and they had an unusually long line. I waited, then ordered to find that they were out of the one  ingredient for my drink. I ordered a different one, waited long enough to not want it anymore, then recieved a luke warm version. It was not cheap. And it was cold out so it became cold right away.

The second errand was to drop off a coat to get lined. I walked there and the guy kindly said it wasn't worth paying for since he'd have to charge too much for it to me worth it for me. I sew a little so decided to line it myself .

 I never take transit, and just knew in my heart that I shouldn't, but decided to bus out to a fabric store. I bussed to the wrong one. It was fine but the employees just *would not* leave me alone and let me shop. One after another was just up in my face asking  if I needed help ""no thanks"" ""no thanks "" ""no thanks"" and I just decided to leave. I knew it was a bad idea and just cut it off.

I missed the bus by 30 sec and waited another 30 min. Then I mix up the stops cuz I never bus and accidentally get off 6 stops early. 

I walk a ways, then decide to stop at a 2nd hand store and just buy an XL blazer and rip it's lining out to repurpose. Fine. Got it. But half of me knows I'll never get around to it and just wasted money.

I walk the rest of the way home, and am so tired that I just decide to eat and shower. I've been feeling crappy for a while and I way overdid it in the AM. After all that, and the *time it took* I accomplished zero of my 3 errands.

I move on so to speak and after some home chores decide to set up my work computer screen to play a video game. I don't play video games but have picked up one recently for fun. I thought I'd get all set up properly on the big screen and with my headphones to have a fun ""escape"" night. Played for about 30 min and it glitched out and closed itself for ""repairs"". Waited about an hour and a half, tried to troubleshoot, and got nowhere and gave up.  I reached out to the video game reddit for help and got mocked.

Final kicker. I placed an important order for this long weekend  (where I live) on Thursday. Their website says 1 hr delivery but they typically hand deliver about 24 hrs later which is fine by me. I had no update from them yet, so I emailed them for an update. Despite the 1 hr delivery, and the fact that they're 15 min. from my house, they told me they put it in the mail from another city yesterday and gave me a tracking number with zero activity. Tomorrow is Sunday and Monday is a holiday so it's just not going to arrive.

Normally, I would cough to cover up a fart, but during COVID, I changed tactics. I would now fart to cover up a cough.

After months of lockdown, I stopped caring about what others thought of me.  I was no longer worried about judgment. I discovered a newfound freedom in embracing my fetishes and natural bodily functions. My ass was free to pass gas.

The world had changed, and so had I. I was no longer the shy person who held back; after all, it's better to let it all out than to keep everything bottled up—unless, of course, you're giving or selling the fart bottle to someone.

Apple told me while we started to be friends that they did not want any of their friends to know their tiktok because they were embarrassed about what they posted and I honestly get that as I have a following and I didn't care, so I never looked for her page.
At the beginning of this semester, me and apple ran into her friend and I told him that I was nervous to follow him on tiktok cuz sometimes what I post can be cringe and Apple made a joke saying ""I even have OP blocked"". Her friend called her out cuz it was weird and she said ""I was joking I wouldn't block you, you just wouldn't be able to find me"" which was fine because I wasn’t searching for it. So this Mango girl.

Like if we went to black parties she would say how they were “ghetto” and she would complain “why are so many Mexicans hitting on me” when we are literally at a Hispanic club. She has also said how Indian people stink as a diss because my ex of 3 years was Indian. 
I have told Apple many times how I’m not friends with this girl and I don’t like that I have to gently explain to mango every time she is racist why she is wrong in an attempt to keep peace between mango and Apple even tho Apple talks smack about her every time we see each other. 
Recently, without details that aren’t too important, mango asked apple to go study at a coffee shop and Apple wanted me to come because she was mad at mango. I asked her “you still want to go???” And she said yes so even tho I had an exam the next day I went with. I had to bail out early and not hang out because I needed to get to sleep for my exam but I saw on mangos tiktok a video of all the girls I was with that night. And in the tags was my friend Apple. And upon realizing I clicked the @ to find that yes, she ABSOLULTY did block me. 
I went and blocked the mango girl and unfollowed Apple on everything because I don’t care that she didn’t want me to see her tiktok. I respected it and I think it’s on principle that why would I be blocked as someone who didn’t do anything to her and she keeps the racist girl who she always talks smack about. I find to be wary of people that are willing to talk about other people but not cut them off especially if they are problematic. Apple thinks that I’m being dramatic and said that she thought that she unblocked me and she was planning on blocking mango again after the tag, which seems like a contradiction and she was just keeping me blocked and hoping I couldn’t see it. 
I don’t want to be around racism and I understand it’s none of my business to tell a black woman what she should do so I just removed myself. Does this make me the AH for not trying to talk about it first? ",1,1728785603.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False
1g2fksr,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g2fksr/granny_exploded_on_me/,granny exploded on me :(,"so i'm aware of what a sensitive issue politics is, and this incident is politically related-- so i vigorously checked the sub's rules to make sure that i wasn't breaking any of them by recounting what happened in this sad but rattling event. i also won't name names of political parties to keep neutrality or what have you. i never thought that this type of political madness would make its way into my social sphere, but i guess i was wrong.

so i frequently visit the coffee shop nearby, and there's an old woman who works there who refers to herself as ""grandma"" and is always sweet to customers by being friendly and handing out free pastry, etc. in the past we've developed more or less of a rapport as we're always nice to each other and have talked about various issues of friends, family, work. i will say she has the tendency to kind of go off on long tangents and ramble though, which maybe is relevant to this incident.

well tonight i went to the cafe just intending to stop by and grab a shot, and ""grandma"" was there. i ordered and briefly, in my election enthusiasm, mentioned that i was doing get-out-the-vote work and that i was so excited about my candidate of choice. she said she couldn't hear me over the workings of the machine and asked that i wait a sec.

she comes back to check me out and hands me my drink, asking ""what was it you wanted to tell me, dear?"" i tell her about the work i'm doing and that i'm so enthusiastic to be doing it. THE WAY THIS WOMAN'S FACE CHANGED, CONTORTED into this expression of RAW, UNBRIDLED FURY. HER EYES. all of a sudden she LAUNCHES into a tirade about price hikes, how everything is going to sink into the depths of hell, how we're going to die... i actually couldn't believe what i was hearing it was so unhinged. like this ""grandma"" lady who had ALWAYS been so sweet and hospitable transformed into a literal mr. (ms.) hyde before my very eyes.

i was actually pretty scared at this point, because she was loudly yelling, in the cafe. i could even see spittle building up at the corners of her mouth, as if she had rabies or something? like kind of balls to the wall unhinged. i was also kind of sad because i guess i realized just how much ""politics"" can change who a person is, how they behave. i slowly backed away from the register and managed a ""oh ok, well i'll talk to you later"" and exited the building as fast as possible. whew.

i was shaken up for a bit, and was even thinking of reporting it to the management of the cafe, but this is her only source of income and i don't want to take that away from her. she's had this job a LONG time. in the end it kind of sucks because now i have one less cafe to go to. or at the very least i'm going to have to call in advance to see who's working.",9,1728785564.0,self,21,0.74,False
