1hcr33q,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinflames/comments/1hcr33q/never_felt_this_way_trying_to_just_trust_and_love/,Never felt this way... trying to just trust and love myself.,"Hi there this is my first post on here. I'm happy to have found a group to be able to talk about this. I've never struggled with feelings for someone as much as I have been with this man. I wanted to share my story here with you all in hopes of connecting and being part of this community. I know that I cannot do this alone and I hope someone can see the connection and offer me some encouragement.

I'm a nursing student and back in October I crossed paths with a man who turned my whole world upside down. A month before I had just resolved to be alone the rest of my life with a dog and a house and invest in friends and family. I felt like being single has been easier than trying to find someone who only accepted certain parts of me and finding myself trying to be someone I'm not only to please someone. It's been a very busy and demanding last few years and I'm ready to graduate in May. But this came at a time where it tested me so much in every way. 

I went in one day to my clinical site for a few hours to put some time in. Normal day just working with patients and my nurse I was precepting with. At some point I noticed this man in scrubs sitting at the desk area that most physicians and anesthesiologists sit at to chart. I remember seeing him and being so attracted to him and I walked by to go to the ice machine to get ice chips for a patient. I looked at him as I walked by and he immediately caught eyes with me. Totally startled me and I felt butterflies. This happened a few more times. Then as he was leaving instead of exiting out the door near him he chose to walk directly by me. I sat there on a stool and could have reached out and touched him that was how close it was. He seemed to walk by in this sad yet calm saunter. I felt like he wanted me to say something to him and I didn't want him to get away. I saw his badge which he was a CRNA and so I said something because that's the career I have been interested in.

""Oh you're a CRNA?"" and he turned around. ""That's hopefully what I want to be some day"" He came back over to me and we began talking about getting into school, all of it being very much professional and only on that topic. He mentioned his email address which signaled to me that he was ok with me contacting him more. I thanked him and he walked away. The same quiet, calm, yet somehow burdened and wounded. 

I emailed him the next day. He wrote me back almost 20 minutes later. It was a reiteration of everything he had mentioned before. I asked him if it would be ok to shadow him in the OR. He said yes and the emails continued for a few days. I would write and get a response within a few hours. They also turned into very informal responses with no signatures or closing just as if we were chatting. I got all the paperwork filled out and submitted. Then I asked him if we could maybe get coffee or a bite to eat and talk more about nursing stuff and questions I had. I was trying to somehow reach out to him to go out without saying it. He said sure and to send him some dates when I would be free to go out. 

I sent him a bunch of dates. I tried to keep it subtle but in the end I told him to pick the place and I'm open to anything. That made it feel like a date and I also put a decision on him. A day later he emailed me back with my first disappointment. He said he was really busy the next two weeks and he didn't live in town so getting over to where we are at with the hospital on his off days were hard. He then said he sometimes has free time in the car to talk on his way home. I felt that pull back from him and I began to see his behavior in terms of backing away. I wanted to just not respond to him at all. 

Of course my response being only a sentence Sure just let me know when. I know he probably sensed my disappointment being so different from my emails which are usually much more words. He said he had time in the evening the rest of the week. I said ok how about Friday. He said sure and gave me his cell number telling me to text him before to make sure he was off work. So now I had his phone number. I thought maybe this is just progress to connect slowly. 

I jotted down some questions to ask him on the phone so it wouldn't be weird. The whole time I'm thinking he might tell me how he feels we might connect. I texted him around the time he said and I got a response ""yup I've got 15 minutes"" a huge second defeating blow. I thought I'd have the length of time it took him to drive home (it's about an hour trek) So I called him. He answered the phone and it was very serious, very cold, not mean but I didn't feel any connection. I asked him how his day was and he replied ""Random."" Then I decided to ask my questions about nursing stuff. He answered them and I knew from his inflection that he was gay. He answered my questions and then we hung up. I sat there in a state of shock. I couldn't talk, I felt so weird. I felt such a state of confusion. I thought it would be much different.

I got deeper and deeper in my feelings for him. I looked at other methods to confirm things. All positive. All saying yes, but not right now, need time, etc. I went in one day to clinical and thought about him all that day. I wanted to see him. He was nowhere to be found. So I decided to go down to the cafeteria and get a soda. I was walking to the cafeteria and I turned around. There around the corner he came pushing a bed to transport a patient out of surgery. Our eyes locked and my heart stopped. I felt he was startled too. It's a big hospital and the timing of that was very synchronous. I didn't wave or smile. 
I came back up on the unit and he was giving report and I saw his back to me. I didn't stop or hang around. He didn't show on the unit after that. Maybe because he had seen me. 

I struggled. I longed for him more. I didn't email him. I knew I was falling behind in my studies and my hours in clinical. I made the tough decision to tell my faculty and requested a transfer to another site across the hospital. I knew that he was going to distract me and I didn't know what would happen if I was in an area and kept trying to pursue him. I never told him and I moved. At this time I started lighting a candle at night and sending him love and good energy, I tried to let go of him and release it. I felt peace when I did it the first time and felt my chest open up. I tried to focus on my new assignment and I tried to just not contact him. 

A few weeks later I had gone on a date with another guy and I felt like I could reach back out to him and mention updates and tell him I moved and where I was working now. The emails started up again. I ended up asking him what he wrote his dissertation on and if I could see it. The doctoral dissertation is kinda like someone's soul. He didn't oppose it and said maybe he could send a PDF at some point but it wasn't light material. At this point asking to read his dissertation I knew I was getting sucked back in. I knew the longing and the agony would come back. 

So I took a huge step. I told him in an email about how I felt about him. I told him I needed to be honest with him. I told him the whole entire time I had been asking him questions and trying to connect with him because I liked him and had feelings for him. I knew it would probably end things but I couldn't keep living in that place of emotional struggle and longing and keeping it all inside. He responded the next day and said I had not done anything wrong asking him all the things about school and CRNA. He then said ""Personally, I'm very settled in my life, and I'm not looking for anything at the moment"" 
I took it as maybe yes but not now, I tried to respond kindly and I guess maybe alluded to the fact that I would keep emailing him. 

He replied back saying if I was to keep communication with him it needed to be clear and with boundaries. No friend or love interest etc. He said he was happy to keep talking but I might not like how busy he was and the current mental bandwidth of this all was not something he sought out. That really stung and it really hurt. I felt he was pushing me away. He left me with a bit of friendly advice about taking my time in my journey to become a CRNA. I thanked him for setting that boundary and that I felt it would be best to not contact him anymore until I was closer to applying to school and more further along in my journey. He replied kindly telling me good luck. 

It ended there. I've respected his boundaries and I've not pushed any further. He knows all my feelings for him now. It's all in the open. He turned me down. I've tried to move on and not feel anything bad. I did what I needed to do being truthful finally about my feelings for him. In the end I was the one to reach out to him when he walked by me. I emailed him the first time. I called him. I told him my feelings. I felt he did feel something but he is either scared or fighting it. 

It's been the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. Some days are easy and I'm in the hospital trying to just go to the cafeteria for lunch. I look for him. I expect maybe to see him. Nothing. I have let go and let the universe take it all. But I feel so deeply for this man. ",2,1734026519.0,twinflames,1,1.0,False

1hcr13c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/1hcr13c/just_another_night_in_chaos_city_rant_ahead/,Just Another Night in Chaos City- Rant ahead,"**So, let me paint you a picture of my “glamorous” night as a nurse on the night shift:**

I roll in at 6:45 PM for a 12-hour shift. My body is already questioning all my life choices. I’m guzzling coffee like it’s the cure for *everything* because sleep is just a distant memory at this point. You think I’m about to start my shift? Nope. First, I have to play “Find the Day Shift Nurse,” who’s either drowning in paperwork or trying to sneak out early while giving me a rushed report that sounds like: “Patient A is stable, Patient B is fine, and Patient C… oh, they coded but it’s chill now.”

Spoiler: *It’s never chill.*

Then comes the patient load. I swear, night shifts are cursed. Every call light feels like it’s rigged to go off every five minutes. It’s like a synchronized symphony of chaos, except the music is people yelling, IV pumps beeping, and my own internal screaming.

Let’s not forget about the patients who “didn’t feel like bothering the day nurse” and wait until 2 AM to tell you, *“Oh, by the way, I’ve been having chest pain since this morning.”* OH GREAT, THANK YOU FOR THAT. Or the family member who calls in at midnight to ask for a detailed breakdown of every single test result since 1985. Sure, let me just pull out my magic crystal ball.

And the charting? It’s never-ending. The day shift gets the glory rounds and patient families cooing over how “amazing” they are. Meanwhile, night shift gets patients sleeping-or, let’s be real, *trying* to sleep while I quietly ninja my way into rooms for vitals, meds, and the million other things we do in the dark. All while trying not to trip over cords or accidentally wake them up because Lord knows I don’t have time to deal with an angry patient at 3 AM.

Then there’s the infamous *“Code Brown”* at 4 AM. Why do bodies decide that *this* is the golden hour for complete digestive system chaos? I’m in full hazmat mode, trying not to gag, while simultaneously hoping I can finish this up in time to prep for the onslaught of early morning labs and vitals.

By 6 AM, I’m a husk of a human being, fueled by caffeine, adrenaline, and spite. Just as I’m wrapping up my 12-hour disaster marathon, the day shift waltzes in looking *fresh* with their Starbucks cups and cheerful small talk. They don’t know what went down. *They will never know.*

When I finally get to my car, the sun is mocking me, and I’m stuck in traffic with the rest of the world that’s starting their day as I’m desperately trying to end mine. The cherry on top? Someone inevitably says, *“At least you only work three days a week!”*

I can’t decide if I want to laugh or cry. Probably both.

**TL;DR:** Night shift nursing is like being on an episode of Survivor, except there’s no prize, only exhaustion and a constant state of ""WTF just happened."" Any other night shifters feel me? Let’s vent together.",1,1734026387.0,Nightshift,0,1.0,False

Battle of Hue - Keith Nolan 

Run Between The Raindrops- Dale Dye  (Novel)

Phase Line Green - Nicholas Warr  (Memoir)  1/5 Charlie Company  Pub. 1997

""Recognizing me as Charlie company platoon Comander, Lt Wilbourne stopped his arduous trek momentarily. Although it obviously pained him to do so, he pointed out that several of my men were in an exposed position, still nonchalantly turning the corner of the intersection, and he quietly chewed my butt. Wilborne said, 'The Alpha CP group just got wasted because we were standing right out in the middle of the intersection, a block behind phase line green, clusterfucked behind a M48 tank. The gooks ran out into the street about a block and a half in front of us and fired three RPG Rockets, hitting the M48 directly in the turret with their first shot. Shit, the skipper and the gunny were both blown away, and Alpha had been effectively eliminated on the battalions left flank. Delta is moving up to take our places, and and we'll be falling back to provide rear security. Fuck, the tank commander had his head blown off! Now, you tell your people that if they keep ditty-bopping across the damned streets, they're they're gonna get themselves blown away too!' Having said his piece, he started his painful trek toward the rear of the battalion column once again. As he walked away, he continued to mutter at me that we should get our collective heads out of our asses, get out the middle of the fucking street, and make goddamned sure to stay alert and keep our heads down"" 

""Early the next morning, 17 February, I spent a few minutes checking out the houses that had, for four days, served our enemy well by providing  them with ready-built fortified defensive positions facing phase line green. I finally began to understand why we had experienced such difficulty getting across the street. Most of these houses were one-story homes, but a couple were two-story affairs, providing excellent and advantageous firing positions for the waiting NVA. From these positions, the NVA could shoot right down on us, point-blank, as we tried to run across the street. This was obvious, and we understood the situation clearly, so we had directed our return fire at the windows and doorways of the houses across the street, which were the likely enemy firing positions. What we had not realized was that the NVA were also shooting at us from well-concealed, dug-in positions between the houses, at street level. 

Vietnam Perkasie - W. D. Ehrhart  (Memoir)  1/1 Battalion intelligence  Pub. 1983

""After that first adrenaline charge across the bridge, most of the fighting in the next two weeks took place on the south side of the river, the side opposite the old city that contained the Citadel of the ancient Annamese emporors. It was the Citadel that later got all the coverage on the six o'clock news, but in the early going, we couldn't even get close to it. We had to set up operations with in the MACV compound, a few hundred Marines in a tiny pocket of a city teeming with 2,000 well-dug-in NVA regulars. From there, we slowly began to extend our tenuous hold of the city, one building at a time.""

""The fighting was made more difficult by the fact that we were in the third-largest city in South Vietnam. After nearly a year in rural areas - never even entering a city except on rare and brief official business – we were faced with dislodging an obviously well-prepared enemy from a built-up urban community of considerable size. We had no experience at this kind of fighting, and the on-the-job training cost us heavily. A great many civilians must have died in the fighting. If you saw or heard – or thought you heard – movement in the house next door, you didn't stop to knock; you just tossed in a grenade.""

""The scouts spent much of our time making the resupply runs from the supply dump in the MACV compound out to the rifle companies, and ferrying wounded Marines to the Battalion aid station. The rest of the time we spent trying to clear out small pockets of resistance left in the wake of the rifle companies, and snipers who had infiltrated back through our lines – soldiers like the ones who had taken out Bannerman and Davis, and the one I had killed while waiting for Mogerty. The city presented a thousand places to hide. Racing along on resupply, we were shot at constantly, and the NVA snipers didn't limit themselves to rifles or even machine guns; often they were armed with B-40s, like the guy who gotten me and Amagasu, or with powerful little 57-millimeter recolliess rifles that could be operated by a single soldier.""

I like what Standard Proof Whiskey Co. is doing. It’s a distillery, bar and kitchen on the south end of Rainey past Emmer & Rye.
I got the Whiskey Wednesday specials. Hot Fried Chicken Sandwiches and Old Fashioneds are half-price all day. The whole food & drink menu is half-price 5p-6p during the week. With the discounts it’s $8.50 for the sandwich and fries and $7.50 for the Old Fashioned. I got the Adobo spiced sandwich, really like it. Maybe  the best food & drink deal on Rainey. 


Went around to corner to check out happy hour at Tómalo. This is a pretty fancy place, definitely a special occasion dinner spot compared to the more neighborhood bar feel at Standard Proof. Got a delicious La Picosa Margarita and a huge guacamole for $11 each. The bartender was super helpful and packaged  the rest of my guac to go with fresh chips that held up really well for later that night. Good stuff. 


And up at Half Step they have a Krapus Cove pop up bar with a pretty killer drink menu. Half Step has always done me right on drinks, their recipes always impress me and these were knockout good, too.  My favorite is a hot buttery rum punch and the Santa’s Slay packs a strong Mezcal & coffee kick. Also did their gravy back shot, Wild Turkey 101 served with a boat of hot brown gravy to chase it down with. 🔥 Happy holidays! ",8,1734026341.0,austinfood,2,1.0,False

Most of the stuff has settled on the bottom but whenever I try to pour off the top layer, no matter how slow and careful I am, all the stuff thats been sitting at the bottom starts mixing with the rest again.

So I gave it a try running it trough some coffee filters but they clog up pretty quickly and the whole process just takes ages and is a pain in general. Maybe a different kind of filter and setup with a bigger funnel and valves on the container would make this easier? Perhaps some of you might have suggestions?

I could just buy new IPA but its not the cheapest here and its quiet the amount Id have to get, even if it would only be every few months. And on top Id have no idea where/how to dispose the used stuff, since those are chemicals after all which you cant just dump somewhere. Despite that it kinda feels like a waste replacing all of it, since only the bottom layer contains all the resin, which is why I originally though about ruinning it trough a filter instead of wasting all of it.

So Id like to know how you guys deal with your used IPA. Do you just replace it after X time and grab some new one or do you go trough some kind of processing it like filtration?",1,1734026325.0,PrintedMinis,0,1.0,False

1hcqyoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1hcqyoc/funny_story_of_my_trip_to_austin/,Funny Story of My Trip to Austin,"I'm new here, but you all seem really cool, so I thought I'd share a funny story of my solo trip to Austin, Texas (USA).

This last September, I was in Texas for work and we had a few days off in the middle of the week. I decided to go to Austin since I've heard so much about the music scene there. I am such a huge planner, so I research the short trip for a couple days. I find a train to take me the couple hours to get there and a shuttle to take me to the train station. I know I had lots other options for transportation, but I thought it would be really fun to take a train, and it was super cheap. I find a concert to go to and I research a dozen other cool things to do. I buy train tickets and concert tickets online. Then I look at lodging and after seeing all the places that have all-night music venues, bars, and restaurants, I think I'll jump in hard my first night and see if I can stay out all night. I don't book anything. I am still a planner and map out three different places that I can stay at if I wimp out and want to go to sleep. I even check to make sure they allow 24-hour check-in. Finally, I plan to walk everywhere since the train station is downtown, but I still research all the bus routes just in case.

Day comes and I have a great ride there. The shuttle driver is super cool and we chat the whole way. He even gives me tips about hanging out in Austin. Sounds like the part of town I'll be in is the best. The train makes my inner child squeal with joy. It's even fancier than I thought I'd get for a mere $11. I arrive in Austin and just roam around taking in the sights. They have trees and bushes just growing wild in between skyscrapers, which is just amazing to see. Then I make my way to the venue and see an amazing rock show at a small venue. Best idea I've ever had so far. 

The concert gets out a little after midnight and I head a couple blocks over to Sixth Street amd look for some food. Oddly, some of the places that I researched were closed, but I find a good pizza place nearby. Sixth Street is hopping with activity. All the bars are packed and I'm loving it. After I eat, I go over to a bar that had a free open mic comedy night. Thought that sounded good, even if it's in a ""so bad it's good"" kind of way. Unfortunately, it's just meh and got worse as it went on. I get out of there around 2am and head to my next adventure. I start hitting up all the music venues that were supposed to br all night and they're all closed. I notice that the street is not as busy as it was. I roam around some more, but can't find anything except some bars that were dying down and some food trucks. It's almost 3am and I sit down to try to figure out what went wrong. I look up the websites that found all my info and I notice a key part that I missed before. All these places were open all night ON. THE. WEEKEND. And it's Tuesday...oops. 

I'm a little disappointed with myself. I usually do much better research when I travel. But it's okay because I had an amazing day. I look up the lodging that I saved as a backup. Good news, there's a hostel right around the corner. I head over and the door is locked. I look at the sign on the door and it directs me to their website to book it online. I pull it up on my phone and I start booking it. The website says it'll give me a code to open the door. Great. Then I realize that the soonest date I can book is today because it's after midnight, and check in starts at 3pm, twelve hours from now. Oh. Hmm. Okay, next place is a couple motels, but they're a little further away. I pull up my bus schedule and I found yet another mistake. I researched bus routes in the middle of the day, not at 3am. There's a bus coming for sure, but not for another 45 minutes. Okay, it's not that far, I'll just walk. I head out and as I do, the wonderful city of Austin has changed. It's pretty scary now. I'm not alone because there are quite a few unhoused individuals joining me as I walk, and they see an easy target to get money. I lose a couple guys following me and start taking alleys and parking lots to avoid the main roads. Then I see a 24-hour iHop and duck in there. The waitress is nice and I hang out there for a bit to settle my nerves before she starts giving me the look that says they're not down for people just hanging out for hours. I understand. move on.

It's 4am now and I finish my walk to the first motel. I go in and they say their computers are doing an update and they can't check me in for another hour. Oddly, there's no lobby to wait in.
I walk a couple blocks to the next motel. I go in (this one has a lobby) and ask for the cheapest room. It's $84. I tell her it says $40 online. She says all those rooms are full. At this point, it's almost 5am and I realize that it's not worth it. There's a train leaving at 9am and I've had enough of mid-week Austin. I'm not paying $84 for 3 hours of sleep. I walk out and head to the nearest bus stop to get a ride to the train station.

I wake up 30 minutes later and realize that I fell asleep on the bus bench. I probably shouldn't have been listening to this week's lecture for the psychological research class I'm taking online. The bus is going to arrive in 15 minutes and I keep myself awake. The bus arrives and starts to slows down. I stand up and the bus hits the gas and takes off. What. Seriously? Did they somehow know about my night and weren't interested in riffraff like me? 

I give up on the bus and decide to walk to the train station. It's only an hour away. And I even find a path along the Colorado River that I can take. I head towards the river and halfway there, a teenage girl starts following me. It's still dark out and I try to keep an eye on her when I realize she's not wearing any clothes. Just a blanket and a backpack. She runs at me to close the gap, but she's still on the other side of the road so I keep my pace steady. That's when I hear her start yelling gibberish and telling me off. Most of what I understand is angry profanity. I have taken quite a few psych classes and I start to think maybe she needs help. Maybe she wandered off from her caregivers. On the other hand, I'm a adult man and I don't know how to help a naked teenage girl in the dark without getting arrested. Maybe I should call the police. Then she changes up her act and starts swinging her fists while she runs at me again. Still very angry at me. I duck around the next corner and move quickly. I'm looking for someplace to hide when I realize she didn't take the turn. Maybe I was just on her path to school and she wasn't interested in sharing. I'm really done with Austin. 

I just about walk backwards as I keep heading to the river, making sure she doesn't come back. I come across a donut shop and manage to convince the nice lady inside to open up for me and sell me some water. I make it to the river and walk along this nice path, joined now by early morning joggers. I try to appreciate the city lights reflecting off the river when it starts to rain. Of course. Why not? The one good thing about Austin in the middle of the night on a Tuesday was that it was warm all night. Why would it keep that up?

So I walk in the rain and by the time I get to the train station, and I have about an hour and a half until the train. I find a coffee shop and buy myself breakfast. I avoid sitting near people because I probably stink now. I have a really good blueberry scone and I start feeling better. I make it on the train and sleep the whole ride back. The next day I realize one of my toenails turned black (it fell off a couple months later).

TL;DR - I took a solo trip to Austin and it was super awesome until it wasn't. Missed some key details in my planning and ended up roaming around downtown all night, sleeping on a bus bench, and avoiding the colorful locals. Highly recommend seeing Austin on the weekend and booking good accommodations well in advance. ",3,1734026214.0,solotravel,0,1.0,False

  This year I'm all out of ideas. They're very wealthy and can buy whatever they want so I want to get them things they may not think of that they would still love. The mom has a colorful, unique taste in art and decor. She enjoys tea and coffee but only decaf and she reads romance books. She also likes traveling and jewelry (both too expensive for me to gift but maybe something to do with that??). The dad is a coffee connoisseur and watch enthusiast. He enjoys non fiction, educational or self help books.

  They both work in tech and are very intelligent. I don't want to gift them anything that would require them to do work (like a puzzle or kit of some sort) because they work a lot and all their free time is spent with their kids. They are wonderful people and treat me so well.

I was mostly interested in checking out the selection and prices; the selection looked pretty good except for the choices of microbrew beers. The prices were higher than I expected; I mostly shop at Harris Teeter for things Aldi doesn't sell, and Amazon's prices were at least as high as HT's with fewer items on sale.

Looking for a comfy night's sleep? I recently tried out the Cozsinoor Queen pillows, and they're pretty impressive. These hotel-style pillows come in a set of two and are filled with soft down alternative material.

I found the pillows to be super cozy, with a cloud-like feel that's great for relaxing. The cover is made from a smooth polyester fabric that feels nice against your skin. I noticed it did a good job of wicking away moisture too, which kept me cool and comfy all night.

https://preview.redd.it/qbiatg4ggg6e1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3a90f562a9bb7c15cb62130d9219c751cb20490

These pillows work well for different sleep positions. I'm a side sleeper, and they gave me good support. My partner who sleeps on their back liked them too. The filling lets air flow through, so the pillows don't get too hot.

One thing I really like is how easy they are to clean. I just tossed them in the washer, and they came out still fluffy and firm. It's nice not having to worry about special care.

# Bottom Line

The Cozsinoor Queen pillows are a solid choice if you want comfy, easy-care pillows. They offer good support and stay cool through the night.



# Overview of the COZSINOOR Bed Pillows

I recently tried out these queen-size pillows and was impressed by their comfort. The set comes with two pillows filled with down-alternative microfiber. They felt soft yet supportive for my neck and head. The cover is made of smooth polyester that felt nice against my skin.

I liked how the pillows adapted to different sleep positions. They worked well whether I slept on my back, side, or stomach. The filling allowed air to flow, keeping me cool at night.

These pillows are easy to care for. I washed them in my machine and they kept their shape nicely. They come in soft and firm options to suit different preferences.

While comfy, they may be too plush for those needing extra firm support. The pillows also took a few days to fully fluff up after unpacking. But overall, I found them to be good quality pillows that improved my sleep.

# Indulge in Cloud-Like Comfort

I sank into these pillows and felt like I was floating on a cloud. The down alternative filling is super plush and cozy. It cradles my head and neck just right. I've slept better since getting these pillows. They work well for side, back, and stomach sleeping. The cover feels soft and smooth against my skin. I like that I can toss them in the washer to keep them fresh. The pillows fluff up nicely after washing too. They're not too firm or too soft - just the right medium feel for me. I wake up feeling refreshed without any neck pain now.

# Premium Sateen Polyester Cover

I was impressed by the cover on these pillows. It's made from German-imported Sateen Polyester that feels smooth and luxurious against my skin. The high thread count gives it a nice, crisp feel. I noticed it did a good job wicking away moisture, keeping me cool and comfortable all night. The cover seems durable too - I've washed mine a few times already and it still looks great. While not quite as soft as cotton, the polyester fabric is still very cozy. It zips off easily for cleaning. The white color looks clean and fresh on my bed.

# Natural-Inspired Design and Support

I found these pillows to have a unique design that mimics natural airflow. The hollow fiberfill allows air to move freely, creating a slow-rebound feel when I lay my head down. This adaptive quality helped ease tension in my neck and shoulders as I slept. The pillows seemed to work well whether I slept on my back, side, or stomach. I appreciated how they contoured to my sleep position without going flat. The breathable cover kept me cool and comfortable throughout the night. While supportive, I noticed they aren't overly firm, striking a nice balance for most sleepers.

# Ease of Maintenance

Keeping these pillows fresh and clean is a breeze. I've washed them in my machine a few times now, and they've held up great. The covers come out looking crisp and new. I was worried the filling might clump, but it stayed evenly distributed. After washing, they fluff up nicely with a quick toss in the dryer. I've noticed they keep their shape well between washes too. No need for constant fluffing or adjusting. The material seems to resist stains and odors pretty well. I spilled some coffee on one, and it wiped off easily without leaving a mark. For busy people who want low-fuss bedding, these pillows fit the bill.

# Commitment to Sleep Excellence

I've been really impressed with how these pillows prioritize quality sleep. The COZSINOOR pillows use premium materials like German-imported Sateen Polyester covers and down alternative fiberfill. This combo creates a plush yet supportive feel that adapts to different sleep positions. I found they helped reduce neck strain when I slept on my side. The pillows are easy to care for too - I've machine washed mine and they kept their shape nicely. While very soft, they may not provide enough firmness for some sleepers who need extra support. Overall though, these pillows aim to deliver hotel-like comfort at home. The brand seems focused on creating personalized sleep solutions for different needs and preferences.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using these COZSINOOR pillows for a while now, and I've got some thoughts to share. Let's break down what's good and not so good about them.

# Pros

* Super soft and fluffy feeling
* Good support for head and neck
* Adapts well to different sleep positions
* Machine washable for easy care
* Breathable cover helps with temperature control
* Decent value for a set of two pillows

# Cons

* May be too soft for those who need firm support
* Some users find them too big
* Not as luxurious as true hotel-quality pillows
* Filling may shift or flatten with use
* Might not suit all sleeping styles equally

I found these pillows to be a mixed bag. They're really comfy and soft, which is great for snuggling up at night. The cover feels nice and smooth, and I like that I can toss them in the wash. They work pretty well whether I'm on my back or side.

But they're not perfect. If you're after really firm support, you might be disappointed. They tend to squish down a bit under your head. Also, while they're nice, they don't quite match up to the fancy pillows you'd find in a high-end hotel.

Some nights, I've had to fluff them up to get them back in shape. And if you're a stomach sleeper, you might find these a bit too lofty. They're big pillows, which is good for some but might be too much for others.

# Customer Reviews

I found these COZSINOOR pillows to be a mixed bag. Many users praise their softness and fluffiness, with some calling them the best pillows they've bought. They seem to work well for different sleep positions. I noticed quite a few people mentioning good head and neck support.

But not everyone was thrilled. Some felt they lacked sturdiness for proper head support. A few buyers said the pillows weren't as advertised, expecting memory foam but getting only poly fill.

The overall rating of 4.2 stars from over 17,000 reviews suggests most people are happy. But there were some complaints about size and quality. I'd say they're worth trying if you like soft pillows, but might not be ideal if you need firm support.

# Conclusion

I found the COZSINOOR pillows to be a solid choice for most sleepers. They offer good support and comfort, striking a nice balance between softness and firmness. The microfiber fill feels plush yet keeps its shape well through the night. I liked how breathable and skin-friendly the covers are. While not perfect for everyone, these pillows work well for back, side, and stomach sleepers. They fluff up nicely after unpacking. The quality seems good for the price point. If you want hotel-style pillows without breaking the bank, these are worth trying out. Just keep in mind they may feel a bit large for some and take a few nights to get used to.",1,1734025628.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

1hcqpmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1hcqpmo/morning_sunlight_and_its_affect_on_sleep/,Morning sunlight and it's affect on sleep,"Sleep troubles here for many years. I've only recently read a lot about how getting some form of sunlight in the morning or even throughout the day is important or even crucial to building melatonin in the body.  It really made a lot of sense to me as immediately I thought back and realized that the days I feel most tired at night are the ones where I spent the afternoon at the beach in the sun. Other than those days that stick out in my mind, I rarely if ever get that super drowsy/tired feeling anymore like I did when I was younger.

It's interesting to me though, because when I *was* younger and even in my 20's (I'm 40 now), I remember always being quite tired around bedtime, but for the majority of my life I never spent a significant amount of time outdoors. When I was a teen I'd walk to school everyday which was a solid 10 minutes. That would have counted, but once out of college I pretty much went straight to working in an office environment and didn't start having sleep problems until many years later. The problems were triggered by a stressful event at work, but once that subsided and my anxiety from it eventually went away, the sleep troubles always seemed to remain to some degree. 

I've had many good phases of sleep, but many bad as well. Overall though, as I've said, I rarely get that super drowsy feeling before bed anymore and even if I do get a decent night of sleep, I tend to not feel 100% rested like I did ""back in the day"". I'm currently experimenting with finally quitting coffee to see if that is the culprit, but I guess I'd just like to hear what everyone else thinks as well. TIA",1,1734025560.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

Most of the stuff has settled on the bottom but whenever I try to pour off the top layer, no matter how slow and careful I am, all the stuff thats been sitting at the bottom starts mixing with the rest again.

So I gave it a try running it trough some coffee filters but they clog up pretty quickly and the whole process just takes ages and is a pain in general. Maybe a different kind of filter and setup with a bigger funnel and valves on the container would make this easier? Perhaps some of you might have suggestions?

I could just buy new IPA but its not the cheapest here and its quiet the amount Id have to get, even if it would only be every few months. And on top Id have no idea where/how to dispose the used stuff, since those are chemicals after all which you cant just dump somewhere. Despite that it kinda feels like a waste replacing all of it, since only the bottom layer contains all the resin, which is why I originally though about ruinning it trough a filter instead of wasting all of it.

So Id like to know how you guys deal with your used IPA. Do you just replace it after X time and grab some new one or do you go trough some kind of processing it like filtration?",1,1734025502.0,3Dprinting,0,1.0,False

1hcqmxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passports/comments/1hcqmxo/urgent_first_us_passport_application_after/,Urgent first U.S. Passport application after Naturalization in NYC- how it goes,"Figured I’d share my experience for anyone in a similar position that wants info:

Don’t waste your time with a 3rd party agency if you are anywhere near NYC because they have lots of appointments available for free direct on the government page

https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/passport-agencies.html

You have to have a travel booking within 14 days. Like a flight to another country or if you’re driving Canada or Mexico or something you need hotel booking confirmation. If like me you were scared to book your travel ahead of being approved for the passport, I just booked my flight the night before my passport interview, because airlines between USA and Europe (and some other routes check for yourself) allow you to cancel your flight for free within 24 hours of booking as long as it’s more than 7 days until you fly. So keep that in mind and play it safe with 9 days or something.

This one is NOT for urgent not life or death. They don’t care why you are going to visit family. I didn’t have to explain myself.

Another thing to note is that they process the passports in order of urgency. So if your flight is the same day, you should hopefully get it the same day. Because mine is 9 days away, I was told to come back and collect my passport any time after Monday (4 days from now). This could be a problem if you have to drive far for your appointment and were expecting it the same day. But luckily for me even though I live 3 hours away I have to come in for work. I won’t be in on Monday but they said I can come next Friday and I don’t need an appointment, just show my receipt and walk in. No standing in line outside.

My appointment was at 10am. I arrived at 9:45 and waited outside in the cold until 10:30am. It is very exposed in that part of town. There was a wind tunnel effect and we were freezing. Dress warm. Don’t arrive early. If I had to do this again I would make my appointment for 15-30 minutes earlier than I planned on arriving. I imagine it is better first thing in the morning and gets progressively worse as the day goes on.
 
You can’t take food or drink into the building. I was allowed to take my empty coffee thermos (and was thankful I had it for the long wait outside). They don’t tell you this until you’re at the x ray machine so that’s annoying. I asked if there was anywhere I could leave my food and they said no. I had lunch with me because I was going to work so I just put it the other side of the door by the trash and hoped for the best. It was still there when I got back and they were cool about letting me get it at that point.

Once inside the building security took about 15 mins, then there was 5 mins wait at the first window where they checked my paperwork and they were really nice.

Then I went upstairs and there was about a 10 minute wait. The agent was mean and rude and didn’t let me use my nice passport photo because my hair was different: I had it straitened nice for the photo I had brought with me but on this day being blown around in the wind and having hardly any sleep I looked rough. She insisted I pay for and get a new photo and when I tried to say I followed all the guidelines regarding the photo she threatened me saying she could reject my application on the spot for the photo if she wanted. I was worried this extra step would involve a lot more waiting as I was already late for work but I just shut up at that point to avoid agitating her further. The photo was horrible but done quickly.

I was out of there by 11:37am.

They have toilets and a water fountain inside.

The 1 line (Houston st) subway is close or the path train from Hoboken gets in 10 mins walk away at Christopher st. I can’t imagine anyone trying to drive/ park there.

Make sure you print out your itinerary. I don’t have a printer at home so went to the fedex 3 mins away from the passport office and it cost me $15 because their direct print wasn’t working so I had to use the internet there and pay stupid money for black and white printing. There is a NY Public Library not too far away and I regret not checking there first to see if I could print.

I paid $225 by debit card which included the passport fee, expedited fee and photograph fee.

Time in line for passport office: 45 mins
Time in passport office: <1 hour
Time until passport in hand: 4 days
Cost: $225

Anyway, I met her on the first day of my job earlier this year and already realized I was very attracted to her during our first conversation. She has such an adorable smile, and our personalities clicked right off the bat. But we work together, so I didn't think anything would happen.

Anyway, we've been out a couple times as friends, with me harboring feelings. A couple days ago we got dinner together, and after steering the conversation towards relationships, I said that I brought it up because I was interested in her.

She said she had recently started to feel the same way about me! I was absolutely overjoyed, and we both kind of went quiet for a bit and laughed whenever we snuck glances at each other. Gave each other a hug and went our separate ways.

So now I've asked her out on an actual date. We're going to see the Christmas lights at the botanical gardens (guess I really am a lesbian) and then get coffee next week. I'm excited, and also pretty nervous. I've literally never been on a date before, or kissed anyone, or anything. I'm maybe looking for some pointers of how to make it romantic rather than friendly?

1hcqcwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/olivegarden/comments/1hcqcwh/hostile_work_environment/,Hostile work environment ,"I was hired by Olive Garden/Darden on August 21, 2023, and from the very beginning, my experience with the company has been riddled with mismanagement, disregard for proper procedures, and an overall lack of accountability from leadership. My initial training was a disaster, and when I raised concerns with WR (director of operations), my feedback was dismissed outright. I sat with him and clearly stated that I wasn’t being taught anything and was being made to feel like an annoyance rather than a valued trainee. Instead of addressing the issue, I was brushed off until another Director of Operations, WW, intervened. Only after Winston highlighted the lack of oversight during a visit did WR take action to ensure my training was handled correctly. This delay in response showed a complete lack of leadership and care for developing staff.

On November 8, 2023, a major company security policy was blatantly violated when EM, a fellow manager, opened the back door  at approximately 9:30 PM. I reported this violation to upper management, as was my duty. Instead of addressing the clear breach of protocol, General Manager KA and WR implied that I was being vindictive. This accusation was rooted in prior comments from Manny, who had openly stated that he did not want to work with me. This baseless claim of vindictiveness created an environment where I was unable to report further violations without fear of retaliation or damage to my reputation.

On January 22, 2024, a team member reported that EM had discussed going out drinking with other staff members. Following company protocol, I contacted BL and KA for guidance and submitted a statement as instructed. During the same period, I was informed of a sexual harassment claim involving two employees. Instead of addressing these serious issues, KA accused me of “instigating” and even suggested that I had “burned the restaurant down” in her absence. This accusation was not only offensive but entirely unfounded. It was clear that management was more interested in silencing me than addressing critical issues within the workplace.

EM further undermined my credibility by telling team members that I was targeting him, damaging my reputation even more. Despite his toxic behavior, including efforts to undermine me and DK the Culinary Manager, no meaningful action was taken by upper management. EM often asserted authority over me in front of staff, saying that he was the manager in charge when present, which fostered a hostile work environment. WR and KA were fully aware of these issues and chose to do nothing. When EM was finally terminated in April after lying during an investigation, I had already requested a transfer due to the unbearable working conditions.

In April 2024, I transferred to A different  location. While the General Manager was supportive, I continued to face targeted scrutiny from WR . At one point, he accused me of calling Culinary Manager SM  “mean” to MIT MM, which was entirely untrue. After speaking with MM, she confirmed that this comment had originated from two OTHER managers, not me. Despite this, Will refused to accept my explanation, further showing his bias and his relentless effort to undermine my credibility.

On July 10, 2024, MS was promoted to LBO Manager, but her consistent failure to perform her duties directly impacted the business. Deliveries were left uncovered, messages weren’t communicated, and callouts went unaddressed. As Service Manager, I had to step in repeatedly to clean up her messes. In August 2024, when SM left, I was forced to take on his culinary responsibilities on top of my service and LBO duties. Despite the addition of two more managers, I continued to bear the brunt of the workload while others neglected their responsibilities.

On October 1, 2024, I raised these ongoing issues with WR, expressing my frustration with the lack of accountability among the other managers and the excessive workload I was handling alone. While WR acknowledged the problems and claimed they would be addressed, nothing changed.

On October 23, 2024, the General Manager at the location retired, leaving the store without proper leadership. An acting General Manager from another store—located two hours away—was assigned, which created complete chaos. Once again, I was left to manage the store essentially on my own. The other managers openly admitted to neglecting their duties, yet no one was held accountable. I worked 6–7 days a week, 10–12 hours a day, while also fielding constant calls and texts on my days off. On November 16, I was forced to drive to the store on my day off to handle preventable issues such as turning on the freezer breaker and locating products left in plain sight.

When I brought these concerns to upper management, including the Acting General Manager and WR, they admitted awareness of the situation but still took no action. I was led to believe that successfully running the store during this time would position me as a candidate for the General Manager role. Instead, after enduring weeks of excessive stress and exhaustion, I was told I was not ready for the position, despite being praised for keeping the store afloat. This was a blatant exploitation of my dedication and capabilities.

On November 7, 2024, a $2,600 delivery order was assigned to a driver without a vehicle large enough to handle it. According to company protocol, this order should have required four drivers, but none were available. Faced with a no-win situation and wanting to protect the guest experience, I allowed the driver to use my personal vehicle. A similar situation occurred on November 21, under equally urgent circumstances. These decisions were made out of necessity due to the lack of resources and support from upper management.

On November 19, while speaking with the general manager of a different location. , Olive Garden, RB , I was told to not do anything to sabotage or set the new GM up to fail. I expressed concern with the statement as I felt it was once again, questioning my character and letting past instances where I was painted in a bad light by Will Reynolds to other people. I was assured that was not the case, but that it was his concern as he had seen other people do it and didn’t want me to do something like that as a friend. I now fully believe it was influenced by statements given by WR due to those previous instances of him saying similar things.

On November 21, I was put on a suspension due to an investigation into letting the team member use my vehicle. At the time I was given no other information and just that they had to look into it to make sure it did not violate any policies. I had to write a statement on the times that I let him use my vehicle and why, and that it was only for business purposes. There was no other information or statement that I was asked to give.

On November 25, 2024, I was terminated. The stated reason was not the use of my vehicle but an alleged perception of favoritism in allowing specific employees to use it. This claim is baseless, as no other employee had ever asked to use my vehicle. The accusation of favoritism is nothing more than a convenient excuse to scapegoat me for systemic failures within the company. Furthermore the investigation and statements were done on the use of my vehicle not on favoritism, therefore there was no statements in regards to favoritism taken from me or by all parties involved and affected. 

On December 10 2024, the reason for termination was changed again to fraternization with said team member. 

The team member in question was promoted to Service Professional by MW prior to his retirement. This promotion was based on the individual’s demonstrated willingness to assist management and his dedication to the store’s success, even at the expense of his own interests. Despite these qualities, some team members expressed jealousy, claiming he did not deserve the promotion and should not have received it.

Regarding the claim of fraternization, it is alleged that the team member brought food and coffee to me. However, this is inaccurate. Coffee was never brought, as I consistently brought my own from Dunkin’ prior to arriving at work. As for food, it was brought by this team member on occasion, but it was shared with multiple team members and managers. While food was brought for manager CL and MS that was not considered fraternization only that I received food. There was no fraternization or inappropriate conduct, nor was there any contact outside of work or work-related matters.

This clarification aims to address any misunderstandings and reaffirm the professionalism upheld in all interactions.

While in this meeting with WR  he did acknowledge that the manager handbook does not say anything about the use of manager vehicles by team members. The handbook states that we cannot give or get rides or lend money. These do not constitute under the use of a vehicle therefore there was no violation of the handbook.

Furthermore when reports of favoritism involving SP SE giving preferential deliveries to her friend were brought to WR’ attention, he chose not to investigate. This selective enforcement of policies demonstrates a clear bias and double standard within the leadership team.

While I acknowledge that allowing someone to use my vehicle was not ideal, it was the only viable option given the circumstances created by management’s failures. To accuse me of favoritism is not only unfair but entirely unfounded. I was forced to make decisions in an environment where support and accountability were nonexistent. I made a decision on what was best for the company and the guests as fully instructed by upper management numerous times.

It is evident that WR and the leadership team failed to uphold Darden’s core principles of listening to employees, fostering accountability, and maintaining high standards. The toxic work environment, lack of accountability, and biased treatment I experienced not only violated company values but also caused significant harm to my mental health and professional reputation. Retaliatory observations can be seen from the original incident in November 2023 until the termination. This includes statements made by the director. 

The company must address these systemic issues, as they are detrimental not only to employees but also to the integrity of the business as a whole.

1hcqcsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1hcqcsj/starbucks_has_rejected_me_4_times_nowwhat_am_i/,Starbucks Has Rejected Me 4 Times Now---What Am I Doing Wrong?,"I have wanted to work at Starbucks for 2 years now, however I have interviewed 4 times and been summarily rejected each time. Here is some of my general background:

I worked at a family diner my first job for 1 year and then started working at a fast food chain where I promoted to Shift Lead and was there for a total of 4.5 years. After this, I applied to Starbucks and got my first interview, having no coffee experience. I was rejected by that location, then got another interview at another location, where I was rejected again.

Following this, I got a job at a smaller coffee chain and learned a ton about coffee and general barista-ing. After working here for 8 months, I applied to the same Starbucks I originally applied at and interviewed with the same person from before, though I am doubtful if she remembered me. This time I interviewed with a little more confidence, now having barista experience. Once again, rejected.

I ended up working at a larger coffee chain following this, where I have been for over a year. I just interviewed at yet another Starbucks, this time knowing the interview questions and the answer format they are looking for. Not only this, my partner is a shift lead at a Starbucks, and many of our friends work at Starbucks, though in different areas. 
Once again, I was rejected.

I really don't get it. Experience, no experience doesn't seem to matter. Knowing the interview questions doesn't seem to matter either. I've had medium length hair, short hair for interviews, doesn't matter. I have a nearly completely open availability except for 3 hours one day a week, on a weekday. Now I even know many people that work there and, despite mentioning it in my most recent interview, that didnt matter either. Never have I ever found it so difficult to get hired by a company despite having experience in the industry and a willingness to work.

 I know Starbucks isn't the best company or anything, but frankly their pay and benefits are highly competitive and far better than anywhere else I've worked. I suppose that's why it's so hard to get hired. But even my partner is baffled as to why I can't get hired because according to her, they hire people way less qualified than me, who have far more limited availabilities. These interviews have me scared that something is wrong with me and I just can't see it. Or that I'm just doomed to work shitty jobs with next to zero benefits for the rest of my life. 

I'm sorry if this post is a little derivative or repetitive, perhaps even off -topic but I'm hoping for any advice you can offer for the next time I interview, if ever. I also just needed to rant a little. ",0,1734024643.0,starbucks,10,0.5,False

Essential Tips for Maintaining Your Smile After Teeth Whitening Treatments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintaining your beautiful smile after undergoing teeth whitening treatments is essential for prolonging those dazzling results. By following a few simple tips, you can help keep your smile bright and vibrant. Here are some proven strategies that will help you maintain your newly whitened teeth.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Stay Away from Staining Foods and Drinks

One of the best ways to keep your teeth white is to avoid foods and beverages that stain. After your whitening treatment, consider limiting your intake of:

- **Coffee and Tea:** These beloved beverages can leave stains on your teeth over time.
- **Red Wine:** Known for its deep color, red wine can darken your whites.
- **Berry Sauces:** Foods like blueberries or blackberries can cling to your teeth.
- **Sauces:** Soy sauce and tomato sauce can contribute to discoloration.

### Practice Good Oral Hygiene

Maintaining a rigorous oral hygiene routine is vital after whitening your teeth. Make sure to brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily. Using a whitening toothpaste can also help keep your smile bright. Consider these steps:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Brush Regularly:** Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoridated toothpaste to avoid tooth sensitivity.
- **Flossing:** This helps remove food particles and plaque between teeth that brushing might miss.
- **Rinsing:** A mouthwash designed for stain reduction can provide additional protection.

### Hydrate with Water

Drinking plenty of water is another essential habit to develop after teeth whitening. Water helps wash away any remnants of food and drinks that could lead to staining. Additionally, it helps maintain your overall oral health by promoting saliva production. Saliva plays a natural role in protecting your enamel and preventing decay.

### Avoid Smoking and Tobacco Products

If you smoke or use tobacco products, your whitening treatment may be significantly less effective. These substances can cause not only yellowing but deep stains that can be more challenging to treat. Quitting smoking elevates your oral health and keeps your teeth looking their best.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Schedule Regular Dental Check-ups

Frequent visits to your dentist are essential for maintaining your smile post-treatment. Regular check-ups allow your dentist to assess your oral health and provide professional cleanings that can help keep your whitening results intact. During these visits, your dentist can also recommend any necessary touch-ups to prolong the brightness of your teeth.

### Consider Touch-Up Treatments

Over time, whitening results may fade. To keep your smile looking fresh, consider doing touch-up treatments every few months. This can be done through at-home kits or by your dental professional. Following their recommendations will ensure you choose the best option for your needs.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Use a Straw for Stain-Prone Drinks

If you do decide to indulge in some staining beverages, using a straw can minimize contact between the liquid and your teeth. This simple switch helps you enjoy your favorite drinks without compromising the brightness of your smile.

### Be Mindful of Your Diet

Your diet plays a significant role in how long your teeth stay white. crunchy fruits and vegetables, like apples and carrots, can naturally scrub your teeth while you chew. Dairy products not only strengthen your teeth due to high calcium content but also help neutralize acids that can create stains.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Taking care of your smile after teeth whitening involves being mindful of your habits and making choices that support your dental health. By following these essential tips, you can enjoy a luminous smile for much longer after your treatment. Remember, the foundation of a great-looking smile starts with your commitment to maintaining it!

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening can significantly transform your smile, yielding impressive results that rejuvenate your confidence. Many people have experienced the striking difference that whitening treatments provide, moving from dull and stained teeth to a bright, radiant smile. Understanding the potential impact of such procedures helps set realistic expectations. Viewing before and after comparisons can serve as motivation and a guide, allowing you to visualize what is possible for your own teeth.

However, achieving a dazzling smile doesn't end after the treatment. To maintain your bright results, it’s essential to adopt healthy habits. Regular dental check-ups, proper oral hygiene, and avoiding foods and beverages that stain can help keep your teeth looking their best. Additionally, using a straw when drinking dark liquids and incorporating whitening toothpaste into your daily routine can prevent future discoloration.

Being proactive about your oral health ensures that your bright smile endures long after you have undergone treatment.

Same faces, same routine, day in, day out.

I’m so tired of hearing the “financial experts” preach the same tired advice: Save more. Cut out the takeaway coffee. Live on a budget. The thing is, I *never* bought takeaway coffee. It’s not the little indulgences that I rarely had that are keeping me stuck—it’s the fact that no matter how frugal I am, my life still feels like it’s in a holding pattern. And when I do save, it gets taxed by the government anyway, so I might as well have bought more coffee for the temporary escape.

Sure, if you want to build wealth, you’ve got to save. But here’s the thing no one tells you: *In order to save a lot, you need to earn a lot.* And for many of us, earning a lot feels impossible. It feels like the deck is stacked against us, and no matter how hard we try to climb, we can’t quite get ahead. The economy’s changing. Jobs are harder to come by. Housing costs are through the roof. And even if you're lucky enough to land a job, wages don't match the cost of living anymore.

I’m not here to tell anyone how to save or how to work their way out of financial ruin. If I had that kind of wisdom, I’d be in a different place myself. But I do think we need to be real about the struggles. The grind is real. The system is flawed. And, sometimes, no matter how hard we try, it just feels like we’re stuck.

I don’t have the answers. I’m just one person trying to navigate this maze, feeling the weight of expectations from society and the relentless advice from so-called experts. But I do know this: A takeaway coffee is not going to fix my life, and I’m tired of pretending that small sacrifices will somehow lead to big wins.",208,1734024183.0,povertyfinance,58,0.94,False

First, it was because I made a glass of water with a Starbucks cup instead of a regular plastic cup like it was the end of the world (don't worry, I work at a hotel, not a Starbucks for the boycotters). Then she critiqued the fact that I used another cup to make a coffee, and then made a snide remark about how I should pay for all the stuff I throw out. I told her ""I would quit the day that happened,"" but she probably didn't hear me and that was the last I saw of her in any major way. But the last part of me quitting really stuck in my mind because I've been going back and forth with this lady for literal months and I'm convinced she's the reason why I contracted these migraines, but back to the meat and potatoes.

This was my very first relationship ( I've only faced rejections in the past ). I was hoping for this to be my first and last. But alas, i myself ended the relationship.

My ex-girlfriend, who was 3 years younger than me had just gotten out of a situationship of 4 years. And months later i made the move. I wanted to treat her right, i wanted to be everything she never got. I gave my everything and the early months were very rough on me with her being very toxic. However, we still continued through the thick and thin. She used to get me food when i came home late from work, got me coffee in the morning when i started work and sat with me in voice calls, got me hot coco when my health got bad. But the downs were much worse than the good. When ut got rough, it got ROUGH. It was so bad that we had to celebrate the week we didn't have a fight iver something. So finally after almost 20 months i decided to end it. I tried to end on a good note but she was persistent and we got back together, not even a few weeks later we had a big fight over a trivial matter and i ended it for good this time, even though not on a good note. She cried and begged me for days to get back but i was nonchalant in the moment and stuck to wanting to break up.

It's been almost two weeks now and the reminiscing is killing. I get flashbacks of her crying and the pain im her voice. I remember all the things she called me, i cannot forgive myself for making her cry and beg like that, even when i didn't want to. Call me a maniac but i still see the good side in her, despite how bad it got for me that i decided to end it. We still talk and I'm slowly letting go of her, but she reminded me how she'd say that she'd peel an orange for me even though she's allergic to them. She called me a nickname and all of these things listen now create a sharp ache in my chest. 

I haven't been able to sleep since the breakup even after relying on sleep medication. It's true i did not have feelings left for her near the end due to her actions, but the she got diagnosed with BPD on the day of the breakup. I do want to move on, but i feel like I'm throwing away a good chance. All my friends advise that i did the right thing because i chose myself and my peace, but the horrors persist. It's an image of abused child who never got the love, but finally started blooming with me. But in the end was abandoned by me as well.

Sorry for using this thread, I felt like writing this because I don't want to bother my friends with the same rant even if they will gladly listen to it. Sorry for any typos or incorrect sentences, I've written this with tears in my eyes and my hands shaking.

I was in there with some friends a few days ago and I walked past this girl and we briefly looked in each other’s eyes, smiled, and continued walking. Idk why but I haven’t felt butterflies like that years.   I saw her walk back and go back and go behind the counter at the Joe Mugg’s coffee shop that’s connected to the bookstore. I kinda freaked out and handed my friend my Starbucks coffee I had been holding because I didn’t want her to notice I had coffee from Starbucks. My friend asked me why I was acting like a dumbass and I told him that I thought the barista was extremely cute. My friends started trying to force me to go talk to her but I got scared and didn’t do it. 

A couple days later I go in and buy a book then go to get coffee so I can chat with her. It was late on the day and I was the only customer there and she was the only barista so we chatted for a little while. She told me how it was her second day at work and she only had four hours of training. She had the perfect level of shyness/awkwardness that it was really comfortable to talk to her. I ended up getting a rewards card but she messed it up because she had never done it before and one of the books a million employees had to come help fix it. It was just more time to keep chatting so I didn’t mind. I didn’t ask for her number or her Instagram but maybe I should’ve.

I went in again the next day this time with my friend. There were a couple customers that day so I didn’t want to ask for her Instagram or something while she was on the clock and infront of random people so I just ordered a coffee for my friend and I. I only got to talk to her a little bit. My friend said that she was staring at me the whole time and kept smiling even when I was sitting down and turned away so maybe that’s a good sign. My friend doesn’t even like coffee so he just pretended to drink his and then I drank it later.

There are a few other factors that complicate things with the whole situation. She’s 17 and I’m 19 which idk if that’s bad. Idk how close to 18 she is and the possibility of me being 20 and her being 17 at some point is scary. I have until July before I’m 20 though. Also I might be leaving to become a combat medic in the army in like a year but she really is beautiful and if I never talked to her I genuinely think it would haunt me or something.

1hcpx9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1hcpx9z/in_the_silence/,In the silence…,"There’s a quiet ache that’s settled into the spaces where warmth and understanding once thrived. I’m a 41-year-old husband and father of two, and from the outside, life probably looks comfortably in place—memories tucked into photo albums, a home in Florida by the beach that’s served us well, and the faint, lingering notes of past adventures. But as time has rolled on, I’ve noticed how easily the tenderness can fade from a marriage. The laughter that once carried us through late nights now echoes softly, a reminder of something that used to feel so alive and effortless.

I’ve always cared about my appearance and well-being, and these days I feel more confident and energetic than ever—fit, poised, and moving through life with a quiet assurance, executive career and all. Yet, behind that outward ease, there’s a longing. Not just a hunger for physical closeness, but the deeper kind of understanding that makes two people lean in towards each other, sharing smiles or whispers that mean more than words alone. Too often now, I’m left feeling unseen and underappreciated, as if who I’ve become goes unnoticed where it matters most.

I know so many here feel that same ache, that sense of drifting apart in what should still be a place of comfort and delight. Maybe you’ve felt it too: that longing for a partner’s touch that carries meaning, for conversations that let you exhale and be heard without judgment, and for a sense that you’re more than just a fixture in each other’s routines.

At times like this, I find myself imagining what it would be like to sit face-to-face with someone who truly understands this quiet ache. To share more than just words on a screen—maybe a simple cup of coffee, a walk along a familiar street—and feel that unspoken understanding pass gently between us. If this feeling resonates with you, I’d welcome the chance to talk, to see if that spark of connection might find its way back into our lives, one honest moment at a time.",1,1734023564.0,DeadBedrooms,0,1.0,False

I have a super impressive girlfriend. She's a med student at the same really good school I'm a phd student at and she has a surgery shelf exam coming up that she's behind on studying for. She said she's getting in the 50s on practice tests and will need around a 70. She's very smart and the issue is just a time thing -- it's not like she's conceptually struggling, she just genuinely has not had enough time to study as much as she would like to be studying.

What can I do that will materially and practically put her in a better position to succeed? She's so smart and I know how well she can do -- what tends to help her I've noticed is just hyping her up and running through her successes and telling her that I really think she'll do well. Beyond that, though, what can I do?

I got her some caffeine + l-theanine gum that helped me get through grad apps because she was talking about caffeine pills. I also left some oat clusters at her place that she told me were really helpful because she doesn't get a ton of chances to eat during the day. Are there any small gifts y'all think would be helpful in this way? I was gonna get her some more protein or oat snacks because I know how bad not eating is in those stressful spots. Short of just gifting her some ritalin what can I get her or do for her that will practically help her out? At this point I think what will really make her feel better from the stress is doing well on the shelf exam lol. But I also don't want to turn into her dad telling her to study more when I know she needs a boyfriend who can listen to her and empathize.

Open to any and all ideas, including just giving her some cash for takeout so she doesn't have to cook or an uber eats gift card or prepping dinner for her, baking cookies or something like that hahaha.

Sorry for the rant and appreciate all the help y'all can offer!!

Edit: i know not to stress her out lmfao. she tells me every day how much this is stressing her out and how important it is to her. we also study together in my office a lot and bring each other snacks and coffee. plus her birthday and christmas overlap so i've been buying her a good bit of gifts recently which is why i'm in that headspace. i get the reddit post seems stressed but in real life i'm spending hours straight grinding on my own work and she's been very supportive of me, i was trying to match her energy.

In short, perhaps I can start by acknowledging that I am in some significant fashion, a flawed man. Most good men can readily acknowledge this. I could probably best be easily identified as a ‘principled degenerate.’ My path has been fraught with sins and addictions, though I’d like to think and am not wrong to say that I have more often than not invested in a better way.

Thus, I will give you a little context: I awoke to your message at whatever hour that was in the early afternoon. I spend most of my nights awake: I make my drawings, I take rest periods throughout by attending to correspondences and perusing Reddit’s version of news. I drink lightly: taking some cider and fortified wine, I drink coffee whenever I care to.

My hours are by some standards abysmal, but I am keeping our house, with the assistance of my partner (redacted), beautifully clean and organized. Our little dog is astonishingly active and well cared for, as are many of the plants we can manage to keep alive. (Some always tend to be a lost cause 🤷‍♂️😸). Our meals are exquisite, and daily so. Our neighbors count us as a blessing.

-

I have lost several close friends and two true loves over the course of my life due to being obtusely idealistic. It could be readily surmised that my version of escapism was cloaked in my idealism and born of, a consequence, of some great laze early in life. Fucking off in school and often detesting even the most heartfelt of authority figures.

For this I have suffered years of incredulously dramatic inadequate conditions of living: years if not decades based on the street, eating trash, sleeping where and how I could, a ‘land pirate’ if you will. But I did maintain many principled standards, sometimes radically upending even these.

-

What I can say is that intimate relationships are fraught with challenges and difficulties. This one you are with has the ones you are presently dealing with, but another will have its unique set. I don’t discount that difficulty it is to be with a partner who is primarily engaged with a form of sex work. I could take stock in that she surely has her principled limits and boundaries. I recall on our last speaking together, (redacted) and mine, strongly advising her to avoid getting involved with drugs to maintain and/or advance her efficiency in her profession. Surely that would spell an unending dark blow to any possible desirable outcome.

-

I have a natural compassion for the difficulty this situation puts you in. I think the easiest and best advice is to simply ‘chop wood and carry water.’ That if your way or the way your could institute has a more congruent, bountiful path and outcome, than you may continue to institute it firstly unto yourself (as I know you are) and secondarily allow it to be of natural influence.

Continue to sculpt the person you mean yourself to be and allow the dividends of this thing to draw her away from the attributes of her current employment that you detest and she has to artificially overlook in order to persevere.

-

It is awful to be in the position of a woman defending herself against what she herself knows she wishes she wasn’t doing, but she has known the pain of inherent subjugation due to what she considered a lack of independence. Whatever factors facilitate such in the mind of an individual, logical or otherwise.

I advise you to accept and appreciate her as she is now as fully as you can muster and maintain such. Suffer it as you can. Rarely are we at a loss for suffering a thing well.

If you yourself conclude the burden to be unbearable, consider the amount of burden that you believe you can shoulder and maintain such. You and her are connected and the gift that is your daughter deserves to anchor to as much consistency as can be had.

-

True lovemaking is also a promise; (redacted) has confided in me in that your lovemaking together is this in full. Forgive me, in a sense, for having such knowledge, but often those dear to me appreciate my ability to maintain composure while they share parts of themselves they have little other place to do so. I certainly don’t know details more than this, ha ha, nor would I seek to. But take stock in this. And if and as you can, be her ‘rock of ages.’ Let it break you sometimes in doing so, soldier on as soon and as well as you can.

Cherish the challenge this is and navigate your way with your family unit as best as you can figure out how. You are worthy, they are worthy, it is worthy.

1hcpvl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shingles/comments/1hcpvl7/for_those_who_have_shingles/,For those who have Shingles,"I just wanted to share my experience and a few tips for those who come on here looking for answers.

Day 1: I had some stinging/soreness when I sat down, and soreness in my hip.

Day 2: When I was taking a shower I noticed the soreness again. I got a mirror and looked, and I had a rash on my bottom. I have never had something like that before so I called my OBGYN (because of location, I preferred her) and she diagnosed Shingles. I immediately started Valacyclovir 1,000mg (ultimately I am going to be taking it for 10 days but common duration is 7 days). I am feeling very tired. Taking NyQuil so I can sleep through the pain.

Day 3: The rash started forming small blisters in some areas. I noticed a couple new spots of rash on my leg (same side as the rash on my bottom. My leg (the one with the rash) started tingling like when it first wakes up from falling asleep and aching. I am still tired a lot and it hurts to walk. Still taking NyQuil. Doc says I can alternate higher dosages of Tylenol and Ibuprofen but I don't want to take all those pills so I am just sticking with NyQuil twice a day. Read that you are only supposed to eat a clean diet of basically vegetables, some fruits and whole grains (but not whole grain bread). I read to especially not eat sugar. You can search up the reasons for this. Basically, it aggravates the Shingles if you eat all the other stuff. No coffee either (tear).

Day 4: The rash is stinging now and I am still having pain in my leg. I put a little vaseline on the rash and have been staying in bed. Tired. Ordered Lysine, Maluka Honey (to put on the spots because a nurse recommended it) and medical boy shorts (gauze like shorts to put on over the rash with honey on it). So far no itching. Foot feels swollen and hurts when I walk. Decided to buy some edibles with 5mg THC and 5mg CBD. Tried one, it knocked me for a loop. Didn't like that.

Day 5: Staying in bed, leg aches and had nerve pain all night. Woke up and took HALF an edible. That was ok. Still hurts to walk. Rash still burns. So far the rash seems dried up but is still there.

Day 6: Rash is scabbing over and starting to burn. Noticed what seemed to be the beginning of a couple more spots.

Day 7: Rash is really starting burn now. Doctor prescribed some pain meds and another week of antivirals. She told me to put Desitin cream on the areas that would come in contact with anything when using the restroom.

Hoping the rash starts to disappear in the next couple of days. I heard it is 7-10 days for spots to heal once they appear.

In summary - I caught mine early. The antiviral med seemed to work by the end of the second day I was taking it. The rash did not spread after the second day of meds. NyQuil seems to work well at night for me. I am just suffering through the nerve pain because it is bearable but my doctor did offer to call in Gabapentin if it got too painful. Keeping Vaseline on the wound in a light amount once a day did seem to help with the burning/dry feeling. Calamine lotion also seemed to help a little except in the areas where I am supposed to use Desitin. I will try the honey also. Not sure how the prescription pain med will work yet as I just took the first dose 20 minutes ago.",1,1734023447.0,shingles,0,1.0,False

At a pizza place that sells slices, there’s a girl who seems really nice and friendly, with a cute style that’s a bit like mine. I’d like to go talk to her and strike up a conversation to see if there’s a connection, but I’m not sure what to say.

The thing is, the place is pretty small, and there are no seats near the counter where I could sit close to her. So, I’d need to approach her, buy a slice of pizza, and somehow start a conversation.

Recently, I was in a car accident, and I’m still looking pretty rough. One idea I had was to go into the shop, order a slice, and have a friend walk in and ask me how I survived the crash. I’d act a bit mysterious and try to get her involved. But this feels a little overcomplicated and forced—it’s not guaranteed she’d be interested in the story, or worse, another employee might get involved instead.

Since she’s new, I could just walk up to her and ask, “You’re new here, right? Haven’t seen you here before.” But I wouldn’t know how to continue from there, and I’d really like to find a way to invite her out for coffee or ask for her number.

The layout of the place is also a bit of an issue. I’m not sure how to keep her talking without making her uncomfortable in front of her coworkers. Honestly, I’m not very good at this, so any suggestions would be incredibly helpful.

If I stood at the counter to eat, I could stay nearby while she’s working, but I’d need a reason to hang around—maybe a friend could join me there to keep the conversation flowing.

Thanks so much to anyone who’s read this far and is willing to leave even a small suggestion! It means a lot.",1,1734023283.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Or, the group I join fizzles out because people don't stay engaged. People are flaky and don't commit. Everyone is like, 30 years younger (slight exaggeration) and we don't have references in common.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

They are notoriously difficult to buy for, and my sister and I regularly talk about how gifts we thought would be a hit end up sitting collecting dust in their original packaging. Last year, my parents didn’t even bring home one of the gifts we gave them and never even noticed. They are coming to stay with me for Christmas, so I do want to give them something they can unwrap. About my parents:

**Dad:** Is an elementary school teacher, retiring at the end of this school year. He likes NY sports teams, soft rock music, cars, bourbon…he’s a typical boomer “manly man” (and everything that implies). He doesn’t care for things that are super fancy, and fancy versions of things he likes are often lost on him. Gifts I’ve given him in the past that were hits: a murphy bar for his deck, bbq spice rub, a tee shirt in Mets colors with the players on a baseball diamond labeled with the “Who’s on First” names, honey baked ham.

**Mom:** Was a nurse for many years, used to be super active and into adventuring type hobbies but suffered a very severe stroke and is now semi-paralyzed (no use of one hand, very limited use of her leg on the same side), can walk short distances but is usually using a wheelchair. She went from being up for anything to really only having reading as her main hobby. Cognitively she has some impairment, and now tends to get really upset very easily, so even sentimental gifts can send her into tears unconsolably. She already has a hummingbird feeder, so bird buddy seems redundant. Gifts I’ve given her successfully in the past: book of the month (my dad has now coopted renewing this subscription), Omaha steak, a gift certificate to their local theater (confirmed with the theater they had ADA seating). She is a dog lover!

They are grandparents, but their only grandchild is my niece, so “grandparent” things feel awkward to gift. My dad has been on a weightloss journey including bariatric surgery, so I try not to give them lots of sweet treats or super indulgent foods. Neither of them are big tea drinkers or coffee lovers.

Any creative ideas are welcome! Budget is between $200-$300 total for both gifts.",2,1734023065.0,GiftIdeas,7,1.0,False

Where do I (35M) start.... Lets start with this, my wife (32) is currently out of town on a work strip. Do I think shes cheating on this trip, more than likely not, but the thought is still there.

She was talking to me last night and could tell something was off, I told her that I didnt want to talk about it over the phone and that we can talk when she gets home today. When she gets home Im going to tell her that I believe that we are headed for divorce and that we need to go to marriage counseling for the sake of our child (1 year old). For context, I WAS about to leave her before she got pregnant (she didnt know I was about to do this). Once I found out we were having a child I decided to stay. I grew up in a broken house and do not want my child doing the same. I also dont want to not see my kid only a few days a week. I want to see her when she wakes up and when she goes to sleep with play time in between. Thats why Im recommending marriage counseling first.

Now the backstory. I used to work overseas where I was away from home for 11 months out of the year. I was gone for 4 years essentially. During that time she did not want to move with me because she was attending school (she got her bachelors degree and Im very proud of that). I was working overseas to pay off debt and save money for a house for us, so we could start our marriage off right. I will admit, I was not the best partner while we were apart for so long. I blame myself for her affair. My expat career started off great for us. We were paying off debt, I was saving money, getting REALLY good at my job, the works. Then after so long apart I started just not talking to her for days to weeks on end, etc. So yeah, I completely blame myself for her seeking out love somewhere else. No one can convince me otherwise.

One day she tells me she wants a divorce, that shes not happy. I ask if there is someone else in the mix and she assures me there isnt. So, I say to myself I dont want to lose the love of my life, if shes unhappy, its more than likley the way im treating her, and the fact that were not even together, that weve been apart for so long. I immediately tell my HR department to cancel my work visas and get me on the next flight back to the states.

On the trip back home all I thought about was getting my life back on track, showing her I love her, giving it time for us to heal, etc. I knew I fucked up and I had work to do.

Side bar, I realize this is a LONG story so thank you for at least reading this far and thank you if you continue.

Once I get home she meets me at the airport with my truck but told me im not staying in the house, ill be staying at a hotel. I said no worries I completely understand. We go to the hotel first, I check in, get my room keys, bring my bags up to my room, and bring her back home. I give her one of the room keys and tell her, Im not staying at a hotel and not having my wife have a key to the room.

Once I drop her off, we get out and I go inside just to grab a few things ill need incase this is an EXTENDED stay at the hotel (I had a SHIT ton of money saved up so I wasn't worried about staying at the hotel forever). Before I leave she pulls me to the side and kisses me. I think GREAT, there is hope. I leave and go back to the hotel.

She ignored me the first day I was home so I called up my in-laws and asked to meet with them. I go over to their house (they were already aware she wanted a divorce) and apologized for the way I treated their daughter, exclaimed my love for her, and stated that I wanted to fix things and be apart of the family for a long time. They were happy and understanding and stated that anything they could do to help our marriage they would do.

The second day she calls me up and asks to hang out. I cant remember exactly what we did but I remember going grocery shopping to stock the fridge at home and she wanted to buy pumpkins (it was October). She said she wanted to carve them together to try and do some couple things. I was happy, she was putting an effort in to try and do things together after I wasnt the greatest husband. On the way home shes telling me about her job, about her co-workers, etc. (She worked at the hotel I was staying at while going to school, keep this is mind for later). She tells me about this one guy she works with and how hes a good guy and a good listener. I didnt think ANYTHING of it while she told me this. I thought ok, you have work friends you talk to, no biggie. WELL, on the way home she gets a text, shes silent for a few minutes and tells me shes not in the mood to carve pumpkins anymore and after I drop her off I should just go back to the hotel. I thought well, shes realizing were not a ""real"" couple right now and this may be happening too fast, so I agree.

Later that night she calls me or texts me and says that she didnt want to hang out because a guy just told her that he loves her and she wants to be with him. That was the text she got in the ride home. I think to myself, Im not giving up my wife to some guy she hardly knows and Im fighting for her. I tell her this.

Now, comes the drama.

The next morning I wake up and head to starbucks to grab a coffee. Leaving the hotel (Hilton) I see her car parked. I think she must have worked last night so I text her and ask if she wants something. No response. I think no worries Ill just go to the reception desk and ask her. When I get to the front desk it isnt my wife working, its someone else. I ask her where my wife is and the lady says IDK (she knows). I dont think anything of it and head to starbucks, get my coffee and decide what I want to do with my day. Later on I get a text that says she cant hang out today.

This is where my memory gets hazy since its been 4 years and I blocked out alot of stuff. I dont remember how I found out, But I remember finding out she stayed the night at the hotel (not working) with that co-worker she was telling me about, sleeping with him... no, not sleeping, fucking.... In the same hotel I was staying at, because its where she wanted me to stay. The thought of that is disgusting to me now. She wanted me to stay at that hotel so she could fuck some guy in it, knowing I was there. (At least thats my thought process)

Well after I find out I go to my in-laws (I live 2000 miles away from my own family) and tell them im moving back into the house whether she likes it or not. Its their rental property that we got for dirt cheap. They agree that I can move back in after hearing what she did and tell her she can choose to leave the house or work it out with me, either way they were not kicking me out (I owe them alot, my in-laws really looked after me for a while). My in-laws talk to my wife, try to knock some sense into her, tell her shes throwing away a 7 year relationship for some guy she barley knows and that if she really wanted to divorce me like she said, she should have done it the proper way instead of sleeping with some guy.

I move back into my house, tell her if she wants a divorce fine, she can have one, but shes not living here. OR she can cut ties with that guy, move back in, and we can work on the relationship. I tell her Ill forgive her and we can work on things. She says thats what she wants and is sorry. She says she wont be staying full time at the house though, that she will be living with her parents but have some overnight visits at our house to try and work on things. I say thats fine and agree to work on our marriage. I convinced myself that the reason she slept with another man is because of me, that I must have been so horrible of a husband that I forced her to do this. I still think this.

The next few months are hell. I dont know how I found out, but I found out she wasnt staying with her parents. She was staying at her cousins house....... with the guy. (Her parents thought we rekindled the relationship and she was living with me). I got sever anxiety when I found out and camped outside her cousins house all night to see if it was true. I stayed a few houses down the street, pulled out my phone and zoomed in (I have poor eyesight) and waited. This was at like 1am. I didnt want to get caught. What I saw at 6am on a grainy zoomed in phone was someone walk out of the house, look around, start the car, and then someone else (a guy) walked out and got in the car. My worst fears were realized. She was still seeing him.

From the looks of it, it wasnt my wife but looked like her cousins build. I instantly throw my truck in drive, haul ass to their driveway, block the driveway and get out to confront the guy (thinking it was her cousin driving and not my wife). Her car slams on the breaks, realizes its me, I hear the guy scream drive, and they almost run me over while going into the ditch to get around me, Somehow the car makes it through the ditch and they drive off. I later find out it was my wife who almost ran me over.

I instantly text my wife (still not realizing it was her) and ask why her cousin almost ran me over and why the fuck they were staying together still and what the fuck was she doing over there instead of her parents. I get a response back that it wasnt him (some excuse I cant remember) and that shes sorry her cousin almost ran me over and she will talk to her about it.

Whatever I think at this point. Ive had enough of the lies. Im almost to my breaking point. Once I find out it was my wife driving, that they have been seeing each other every night I completely lose it. I tell her to come over to the house because I need to talk to her. I planned on killing myself in front of her that night. For context, I have PTSD from my time in Afghanistan (before we met). I pulled a pistol out of the safe, put it in my waist band, and waited. When she came over I started bawling my eyes out. Asking how she could be this spiteful to another human, ask how she could lie to me, tell me she wants to work on things, lie to her family, lie to everyone, and go behind everyones back and do this. She tells me its over and she doesnt want to be with me. That line right there confirmed what I had to do. I pulled out the pistol, put it to my head and I cant remember if I pulled the trigger and it clicked or if she pulled the gun away before I could pull the trigger. Either way my life was spared but I was 1000% ready to end it right there. That should have been a sign.

I never told anyone that, it was never brought up again and ive suppressed that for a long time.

The next day I go see a divorce lawyer, hand over the retainer, and tell my wife I just saw a divorce lawyer and she should do the same. I tell her my next meeting with the lawyer and say she should have one prepared by then. I dont remember what happened between then and the second meeting with the lawyer but I remember getting a text on my way there from her saying she was sorry and if I decided to go through with it she understood. Something made me turn around and head home. I tell her to meet me at the house and she does. I ask her, do you want to work on this, she says yes, tells me she broke it off with the other guy and says she wants to work on the marriage. I have her tell me everything, what they did, for how long, the works. Then something sparked inside of me that made me ask if there were any other affairs. This should have been a sign. She tells me about 2 more while I was gone. Im sick to my stomach just reliving this.

SOMEHOW I convinced myself to accept this and work on the marriage. 7 years was a long time to just throw away. We work on things, move into a house we build (small but I built it myself, in cash, with my own hands). I still had thoughts of what she did but told myself I need to get over it, I agreed to work on this. 2 years later we find our were pregnant. Literally a week leading up to this, I was considering leaving her because I cannot get over what happened. Ill be honest, the first thought that crossed my mind was ""is this my baby"". I even ask her. She says yes it is and I dont think of it again until my daughter is about to be born. Were happy the whole time, Im thinking this is the best part of my life and Im on top of the world.

It comes time for my baby to be born and the whole time leading up to her coming into this world is me thinking ""please let this be mine, please let this be mine"". Well, good news, theres no denying this child is mine, even without a paternity test. I dont need one. This kid does every twitch I do, looks just like me (god bless her lol), shes definitely my child.

Things are great for a while. The occasional thought back to the infidelity but nothing serious. Well here it is, December and its all I can think about. After 4 years it still hits me. Between October and January I realize that every year it hits me like a ton of bricks because these were the worst months of my life. I realize that every year I feel this way, that I get really depressed. Im tired of living like this. Im tired of reliving all the memories and re-feeling all the hurt. Feeling the knife plunge deep inside me. I wish I left her years ago, I wish I left her before my baby was born.

I dont want to leave her now. I want things to get better in my head. The past few years she hasnt given me a reason to distrust her or think shes cheating again. I want things to get better so I can be a good father to my child. I just dont want to feel this hurt any longer. Does it ever get better?

Im telling her when she gets home though that I cannot live like this any longer. I cant be a good father to my child with these feelings. Im telling her we either need to go to marriage counseling or its over.

Side note for more context. We dont really have sex since the affairs. Maybe once or twice a month (my doing, she wants to, I dont). I dont feel attracted to her THAT much anymore. Theres still attraction, theres still the urge to have sex, and thats when we do. She knows somethings been up for a while now.

I really dont want a divorce, I dont want to do that to my child, she is my world and id rather be miserable but put on a smile and hide my feelings that let her see that mommy and daddy arent together. I dont want her growing up thinking she was the issue.

So, does it ever get better, can marriage counseling work? Do I just need to get the hell over it?",6,1734023036.0,survivinginfidelity,10,0.8,False

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

There’s still a lot of cash looking for a place to invest. The lower the stock price the more easily/frequently the stock is hyped (pump & dump).  The trick of course is to identify a stock as early in the pump stage as possible, ride the pump and get the f\*\*k out before the dump. This has little to do with Fundamentals, it’s mostly greed.

**Buy Low (at the start of the pump)**

When you see a low value stock showing a high % gain, you’ve likely missed the pump. But a successful pump on one stock will bleed over into other low value stocks in the same sector.  

* Google Finance, Compare
* Yahoo Finance, Analysis, Related Tickers
* Barrons, Search News & Quotes, Peers
* Google, “Space Race Stocks”
* [ETF.com](http://ETF.com), Search ticker, select ETF, Holdings

 A buddy suggested I keep an eye on RKLB, so I bought a bit to keep an eye on it while I searched the sector. See the picture for the play by play over a week or two as the pump gained steam.

**Sell High (before the dump)**

For most of these I used the Yahoo Finance “advanced chart” feature to watch the movement of each stock in real time. Switching between the 1 Day & 5 Day view will give you a feel for the momentum. For any stock with more than a 10%, I’ll put an 8% trailing stop sell order on it.

1hcphc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SimonPowellGDM/comments/1hcphc4/the_engineers_guide_to_dating_stop_debugging/,The Engineer’s Guide to Dating: Stop Debugging Legacy Code and Start Living,"Let’s face it, dating in your 30s or 40s feels like trying to debug someone else’s spaghetti code—messy, outdated, and full of unhandled exceptions. But here’s the thing: you already have the mindset to solve complex problems. The catch? You’re using the wrong framework.

This isn’t another cookie-cutter guide filled with useless advice like ""be yourself"" or ""just put yourself out there."" No, this is about building a system—a system that works. So, grab your metaphorical IDE, and let’s rewrite your dating script.

# Step 1: Your Code Has Bugs—Fix Them

Here’s the brutal truth: the dating system isn’t broken. You’re just running outdated code. Sure, apps suck, the culture’s confusing, and sometimes it feels like everyone else got a manual you didn’t. But sitting around blaming the system? That’s a losing game.

**How to Fix It:**

* **Reality Check Your Excuses**: Write down three excuses you’ve used to explain why dating isn’t working for you (e.g., ""I’m too busy,"" ""Women just want rich guys""). Then, challenge each one with a practical action. Example: ""I’m too busy → I’ll dedicate 2 hours a week to meeting new people."" Excuses are just bugs in your thinking. Fix them.
* **Kill the Fantasy**: Stop idealizing the one that got away, or the idea that love will ""just happen."" Write down one belief that’s holding you back (e.g., ""My soulmate is out there waiting""). Then, replace it with something actionable: ""Love happens when I make space for it.""

# Step 2: Create a Dating Framework That Doesn’t Suck

You wouldn’t tackle a major project without a plan. So why are you winging it in your dating life? Hoping for a connection while endlessly swiping is like hoping for a clean build without running tests.

**How to Fix It:**

* **Write Your Dating Manifesto**: Forget vague goals like ""find someone."" Write down what *actually* matters to you. Example: ""I want someone who’s ambitious, loves hiking, and has a good sense of humor."" Be specific about non-negotiables. Anything else? Let it go.
* **Run Micro-Experiments**: Stop obsessing over outcomes and start testing inputs. Example: ""I’ll approach one new person a week in real life—gym, coffee shop, whatever—and ask an open-ended question to start a conversation."" See what happens.

# Step 3: Stop Wasting Time and Energy

You’re not 22 anymore. You can’t spend endless hours swiping through profiles, only to end up on boring dates that feel like job interviews. Your time is precious—treat it that way.

**How to Fix It:**

* **Audit Your Energy**: Before optimizing your time, figure out where your energy is best spent. Are you an introvert who thrives in small groups? Go for coffee meetups or niche hobby clubs. Extrovert? Hit up networking events or group fitness classes.
* **Say No to Drains**: If certain apps, matches, or habits leave you feeling more frustrated than hopeful, cut them. Spend that energy on what actually lights you up.

# Step 4: People Aren’t Metrics—But You Can Learn From Them

Let’s be clear: if you treat dating like a KPI report, you’re going to miss the point. But that doesn’t mean you can’t learn from patterns.

**How to Fix It:**

* **Log Feelings, Not Just Stats**: After every date, reflect on *how you felt*. Were you excited? Comfortable? Drained? Use this emotional feedback to refine who and what you’re looking for.
* **Tweak One Thing at a Time**: Maybe you talk about work too much, or maybe you don’t share enough. Pick one small change to try on your next date and see if it shifts the dynamic.

# Step 5: Get Over Yourself (In the Best Way)

Newsflash: dating isn’t just about finding someone who likes you—it’s about showing up as someone worth liking. And no, this isn’t about being ""perfect."" It’s about being real.

**How to Fix It:**

* **Rejection is the Goal**: Yes, you heard that right. Aim for 10 rejections this month. Walk up to strangers, start conversations, and embrace the ""no."" Why? Because the more you put yourself out there, the easier it gets—and you’ll stop taking it personally.
* **Stop Solving, Start Listening**: On your next date, ask a question that invites vulnerability, like, ""What’s something you’ve always wanted to do but haven’t yet?"" Listen without trying to ""fix"" their answer.

# Closing Thoughts: Build Your Dating System, One Iteration at a Time

Here’s the bottom line: dating isn’t about finding perfection. It’s about showing up, screwing up, and learning as you go. Stop waiting for ""the one"" to magically appear. Start building real connections—one awkward conversation, one imperfect date, one tiny step at a time.

1hcph4i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hcph4i,(These are all unfinished) having trouble nailing down a paint scheme. Would appreciate feedback. ,"These are all in some state of unfinished so yes I’m aware that my details aren’t finalized but I’d love some feedback on which details work and don’t?

1. Red vs Orange secondary color:

I like the head color of the ghostkeel and I’m thinking of swapping out the orange detail color on the commander for that and making that the flair color army wide.

2. Too much gold? Green and gold look nice together but I think the helm on the commander and antenna on the stealth suit are too much? I’ve opted to just use gunmetal for the antenna on the crisis and I think that looks good. 

3. Internal consistency- was going to make the Stanley screwdriver bolt (for lack of a better term) the box art “Retributor armor” gold but I don’t think I can do the tau symbol in that color as well thus leading to too much gold. 

Love some suggestions on that - I kind of like the option that I went with for the crisis which was grey knights steel with the ° highlighted in gold. 

Here’s my current paint order:

 (which was done for the crisis- in the past I tried zenithil highlighting with militarism green contrast on the commander but it looks coffee stained camoish on flat panels which isn’t bad it just doesn’t feel intentional or even) 

1. Prime Black
2. Engine ports and details white for later detailing 
3. Dry Brush entire model in LeadBelcher to get all the metal bits and create metallic undercoat
4. Sponge Paint flat panels with death World forest green- (does a good job at eliminating brush strokes) 
5. edge highlight (poorly- it was a rush job) with straken green
6. Frostheart contrast on white engine ports for 
7. Detail metal bits with grey knights steel

Ultimately I’m shooting for “hey this looks realistic in both our world and 40k” which is why I went with olive drab green although if I was to do it all over again I’d prob go with a Grey like I did the battletech catapult in the last picture. 

Anyway love some feedback and suggestions other than “hey these aren’t finished” because clearly they aren’t. Thanks.",31,1734022448.0,Tau40K,6,1.0,False

1hcpbqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1hcpbqr/hack_my_sibo_plan_please/,Hack my SIBO plan please!,"Hello SIBO strugglers,

Recently I \*finally\* got confirmation of what I long suspected. The first SIBO test was invalid, and it took a while to get the 2nd in and then get the results which are attached. Hydrogen & methane. My primary care doc tested for tryptase and that was normal but I seem to have some histamine sensitivity related to SIBO. GI map was also oddly mostly normal but had higher levels of Staphylococcus aureus (staph) bacteria.

Primary symptoms are: terrible bloating and burping, belly distension, lack of appetite, no hunger despite eating very little, underweight, bad chronic pain, occasional brain fog - thankfully less of that on carnivore and dropping coffee - poor quality sleep as a result of the chronic pain, and ongoing mental health challenge dealing with this nightmare. Sometimes constipation, usually not diarrhea. Chronic pain has ruined my life, there is lower back constriction I think due to these digestive issues which also gives me TMJ. User name checks out.

Diet plan:

Shifted to carnivore a few months ago and though I haven't been absolutely 100% I'm pretty much in high 90s right now and even getting off coffee again. The 1-3% that isn't carnivore is a bit of 100% chocolate like 1x a week and I'm still seduced by the occasional drink though having more whiskey than beer and wine. ""Occasional"" to me means 1-2 per week. And the herbs below. Actually I love this way of eating and don't miss a a lot of things that I thought I might. So what am I eating? Meat of various types especially elk & bison, lots of pressure cooked broth with animal feet for extra gelatin and collagen, bone marrow, grass fed tallow, & duck fat, eggs especially duck eggs, bit of butter, seafood once a week. Also organs like beef heart, duck liver, and others in small amounts but regularly.

Herb plan:  
Artichoke extract 2x per day - this seems to be really helping flush out my liver and increase motility & solve constipation. Hopeful on this.

Ginger extract with meals same time as artichoke, small ginger drops in water after eating.

Dr Berg digestive enzymes 2 kinds, Advanced Digestive and Gallbladder. Gallbladder has 6 things, including Ox bile and Betaine Hydrochloride.

Oregano enteric coated 1x per day. Allicin 1x per day.

Peppermint enteric coated 1-2 per day depending on burping. Doesn't seem to help that much though.

Extra Vitamins and such

Vit D since darker here, I also like a cod liver butter oil combo that seems to help my brain.

Also: since SIBO tends to block or mess with some vitamins and minerals, extra B1 in morning, then in evening B6 as P5P50, B12, selenium, zinc picolinate / carnosine alternated, and methyl folate. I don't know why this combo seems to set my body straight and feel like I have more serotonin in my system and taste my food better. If I feel more serotonin and better taste regularly then I'll drop these. Very small portions magnesium glycinate although still on the fence if I should be having this or not. Sometimes helps me go back to sleep.

There are other exercise, breathwork, and meditation things I attempt to do that aren't really necessary to get into here.

The main question is whether all this is enough or if I should just do the antibiotics my primary care doc is suggesting, rifaximin and neomycin. After all the undereating I have a very sensitive system and typically react negatively to the antibiotics hence I'd rather succeed with herbals. That said I've lost years of my life to this nightmare and been trying to make a real change in so many ways and so many times. If the antibiotics will work better then I should just do those pronto and could shift to herbals after.

If you have any questions, or think something else would help, please let me know. Also might other things help the gut detox and by less gassy like activated charcoal?

TLDR; Hydrogen & Methane SIBO ruining my life. Can carnivore diet and herbals work? Or should I just start with antibiotics and then shift to herbals if needed?

Thank you all so much for taking time to read this tome and for any suggestions you might have. I'm also using ChatGPT, Grok and others just to see what they say.

The reasoning (according to their boss) is that leaving the door wide open attracts more customers. 

We've had a couple of freezing days this month already, and the door to the cafe was kept open. And the working conditions have been brutal. The staff can't wear coats or jackets because the space is tight and they would just get in the way. They can't wear gloves because they have to regularly clean their hands between taking money, making coffee, handling food, etc. Also it's impossible (and insanely expensive) to warm up a space when it's -4 and windy outside, and the door is open. The boss won't budge on their decision because they're firmly convinced that it attracts more foot traffic. 

My mate and his colleagues take all this at face value but to me this is unhinged. I don't pop into cafes for takeaway coffee or pastries or whatever, so I can't comment. But if you're someone who does this regularly, would you really be put off entering a cafe simply because their front door is closed (even though the sign says they're open and there's people inside)?

Looking for a handy way to organize your home or office? I recently tried out the Nelko P21 label maker and found it to be a nifty little device.

This compact printer connects to your phone via Bluetooth, letting you create custom labels on the go. I was impressed by how easy it was to set up and use. The app offers lots of fonts and templates to pick from, making it simple to design labels for all sorts of items.

https://preview.redd.it/souex0eg5g6e1.jpg?width=466&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc874bc422dff89b7885a1fe3d42fbb1402546a

The P21 prints quickly and quietly using thermal technology, so there's no need for ink or toner. I liked that it's rechargeable and portable enough to slip in a pocket. The print quality is good for basic labeling needs.

While it only prints in black and white, the P21 can handle a variety of label sizes. I found it useful for organizing kitchen items, office supplies, and even making name tags. The labels stick well and don't smudge easily.

# Bottom Line

The Nelko P21 is a handy tool for anyone who wants to get organized. It's simple to use and creates clear, durable labels.



# Overview of the Nelko Label Maker Machine, P21

I recently got my hands on the Nelko P21 and I'm impressed. This compact label maker is a game-changer for organization. It's super portable - I can easily slip it in my pocket. The P21 connects to my phone via Bluetooth, letting me print labels anywhere.

The app is user-friendly with tons of templates. I've made labels for my office supplies, kitchen containers, and even gift tags. The print quality is sharp, and I don't need to buy ink. It's great for quick labels, but keep in mind it only prints in black.

One downside is the fixed label sizes, so you can't make custom-length labels. Also, it doesn't work with computers. But for most labeling tasks, the P21 does the job well. It's a handy tool for anyone looking to get organized.

# Revolutionary Portability and Convenience

I was amazed by how compact and travel-friendly this label maker is. The P21 fits easily in my pocket, making it perfect for on-the-go organization. Its wireless Bluetooth connectivity lets me print labels from my phone anywhere.

The rechargeable battery lasts a long time between charges. I've used it for days without needing to plug it in. The thermal printing technology means I don't have to worry about buying ink or toner.

Setting up the P21 was quick and simple. I just downloaded the app, loaded the label tape, and connected via Bluetooth. Within minutes, I was creating and printing custom labels.

# Pros

* Ultra-portable size
* Wireless Bluetooth printing from phones
* No ink or toner needed
* Long-lasting rechargeable battery
* Easy setup process

# Cons

* Only prints in black and white
* Limited to specific label sizes
* Not compatible with computers

While the P21 isn't perfect, its portability and ease of use make it a great choice for quick labeling tasks at home or on the go. The ability to slip it in my pocket and print labels anytime is a game-changer for staying organized.

# Seamless Connectivity and Operation

I found the Nelko P21 label maker super easy to set up and use. It pairs quickly with my phone via Bluetooth. The app is simple to navigate and has tons of fonts and templates. I just pick a design, type my text, and hit print. The labels come out fast and clear. No ink needed - it's all thermal printing. Battery life is good too. I've used it for days without recharging. One small issue: it doesn't work with computers, just phones. But for most tasks, that's not a problem. Overall, the P21 is a breeze to operate and makes labeling stuff quick and fun.

# High-Quality Printing Performance

I'm really impressed with the print quality on this little device. The Nelko P21 uses thermal printing tech, so there's no need for ink or toner. It prints sharp, clear labels at 203 DPI resolution. I found the text crisp and easy to read, even on smaller labels. The printer is fast too - it can crank out about 30 labels per minute.

One downside is that it only prints in black and white. But for most labeling needs, that's not a big issue. The app lets you get creative with fonts, borders, and graphics to make your labels pop. I've used it to label all sorts of things around my house and office.

# Creative Freedom with Multiple Templates

I found the Nelko P21 label maker offers lots of options for customization. The app includes over 450 materials and 90+ fonts to choose from. I played around with creating labels using text, QR codes, barcodes, images, and more. The templates make it easy to design labels for organizing stuff at home or work. I made some cool name tags for my kids' school items. The fixed label sizes (like 14x40mm, 14x50mm, 14x75mm) work well for most needs. While you can't print continuous labels, I still had fun making unique designs within the size limits.

# Versatile Applications for Home and Office

I've found this label maker to be super handy around both my home and office. At home, I use it to organize my closet, label food containers, and mark cosmetics. It's great for sorting mail too. At work, it's perfect for labeling files, making price tags, and creating reminders. I even used it to make name tags for a meeting. The app lets me quickly design labels with text, QR codes, and images. It's small enough to carry in my bag, so I can label stuff wherever I am. The wireless feature is a big plus - no cords to deal with. While it only prints in black, the labels look clean and professional.

# Sustainability and Safety

I was pleased to find that the Nelko label maker uses thermal printing technology, which means no ink or toner is needed. This makes it a more eco-friendly choice compared to traditional printers. The device is rechargeable, cutting down on battery waste. I noticed it's made with BPA-free materials, which is good for safety. The small size means less plastic used overall. While it's not perfect, I think it's a step in the right direction for sustainability in office products. The lack of ink cartridges to dispose of is a big plus in my book.

# Customer Reviews

I found the Nelko label maker to be a hit with users. People praise its compact size, comparing it to everyday objects like coffee mugs. The app gets high marks for ease of use and fun design options. Print quality is generally good, though not perfect. Many users enjoy how quick and simple it is to create custom labels for organizing. The wireless functionality and portability are big pluses. Some buyers even mentioned using it for creative projects or in their Airbnb rentals. While most feedback is positive, a few noted print quality could be better. Overall, customers seem to feel they got good value for the price. The Nelko appears to be a solid choice for basic home and office labeling needs.

# Conclusion

After using the Nelko label maker for a while, I'm impressed with its overall performance. It's a handy little device that packs a punch. The compact size makes it easy to store and use anywhere. I found the app user-friendly and printing quick. While the print quality is decent, it's not perfect. The wireless feature is a big plus, and I like the variety of templates. It's great for organizing, but the labels might not stick well on all surfaces. For its price, it's a solid choice for home or office use. If you need a basic label maker that's easy to use and portable, this Nelko model is worth considering.",1,1734021935.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

I (29M) have this friend, let’s call him Dave (30M). Dave and I have been friends since high school, and I’ve always known him to be... a bit of a mess, right? Like, this guy is the type who’ll go out for a coffee and come back an hour later with the receipt still in his pocket, like he just time-traveled from 2011. But we’ve always gotten along—he’s a good dude, just... eccentric. So when Dave calls me up a couple of weeks ago, saying, “Yo man, I need a place to crash for a couple of days,” I’m thinking, “Alright, no biggie, right?”

Now, pause—I live in a small apartment, and I’ve got this routine that works for me. It’s clean, everything’s in its place, nothing too fancy, but it’s home. I thought, “How bad could it be? It’s just a few days.”

Fast forward to Dave showing up. And the first thing I notice? This guy walks in with a backpack, a duffel bag, and—this is important—three Tupperware containers. I’m like, “Uh, Dave, what’s with the Tupperware?” And he’s like, “Oh, it’s my leftovers. I didn’t want them to go to waste.” I’m thinking, alright, no big deal. So, we hang out for a bit, catch up, everything’s chill.

Then things start to get weird. Dave goes into the bathroom, right? And I don’t think much of it, but then I hear shuffling, like he’s moving stuff around. So, I go check, and there he is, trying to clean the sink with his sock. I’m like, “Bro, you’re using your sock to clean the sink?” And he’s like, “Yeah, man, I didn’t want to get my hands dirty.” I just... stare. And before I can even react, he’s like, “Yo, I’m gonna put the sock in the laundry later, it’s all good.” I just nodded and walked out.

Okay, fast forward to day two. Now, it’s not just socks in the sink. I walk into the living room, and there’s a whole pizza—not in a box, just sitting on the coffee table, open, no napkins, no plates, like it's just there. And I’m like, “Dave, you just... left a pizza on the table?” And he’s like, “Oh, I was gonna finish it, but I got distracted by this documentary about Bigfoot.” Bigfoot.🤦🏽‍♂️

And here’s the thing—this is where I start feeling a little uneasy: he’s not even acknowledging the mess anymore. It’s like his brain just turned off the ""clean up"" function. So I start picking up the pizza, right? And I notice, there’s like, stuff on the floor around it. Not crumbs—like, actual, random things. A used fork, a couple of pens, a bottle cap, and a single sock. And I’m thinking, “What is happening here? Why is there a sock on my floor in the middle of a pizza crime scene?”

So, I pull him aside and I’m like, “Yo, man, I don’t want to be that guy, but the mess is starting to get out of hand.” He looks at me, dead serious, and says, “Nah, dude, it’s just a little mess. I’m comfy. I thought you were chill about stuff like this.”

And that’s when I realized—I’ve been too chill. I’ve been way too chill.

Okay, so here’s the side story I wasn’t planning to tell, but it’s important. I’ve got this neighbor, Kenny (40s), right? Kenny’s one of those guys who’s always watching. Like, the guy’s like a hawk when it comes to who’s coming and going in the building. He’s a good dude, but dude. Anyway, I see Kenny in the hallway a couple of days later, and he says, “Hey, you got that guy over? Dave, right?” And I’m like, “Yeah, he’s crashing for a bit. Why?” Kenny leans in and says, “You might want to check your mailbox.” And I’m like, “What, did he take something from my mailbox?” And Kenny goes, “No, no. But I saw him smoking in your place... while the window was closed. Just thought you should know.”

Now I’m really starting to get that feeling, you know? Like, I’m watching a sitcom where things are just not right but I’m too deep in it to pull the plug.

Alright, so now I go home and I’m really starting to think about it. I go to the kitchen, and there’s a half-opened bag of chips on the counter. It’s not even on the counter—it’s just leaning against the wall, like it’s been standing up by itself. And there’s a trail of chips scattered across the kitchen floor. Like, someone just dropped them and said, “Eh, close enough.”

At this point, I’m sitting there in the kitchen, staring at the chip trail, and it hits me—this is my house, not a landfill. And that’s when I go full “talking-to-myself-in-the-mirror mode.” I’m like, “Alright, man, this is it. You need to say something to Dave. You gotta get him out.”

So I sit him down, right? I’m like, “Yo, Dave, I’m gonna level with you. The mess is getting out of hand. I can’t do this anymore.” And he looks at me like I just told him I’m moving to Antarctica. Like, he was shocked. And I’m like, “Bro, I’ve been patient, but this is not working.”

So Dave, all hurt and dramatic, goes, “Dude, what am I supposed to do now? I’m homeless, man. I don’t even have a place to crash!” And I’m just standing there like, “You’re not homeless, you just can’t live here.”

Now, here's where it gets even weirder: our mutual friend Tommy (27M) calls me up that night, all concerned, asking, “Yo, why’d you kick Dave out? He’s all pissed about it.” And I’m like, “Tommy, do you not see the pizza crime scene in my living room? The sock in the bathroom?” And Tommy’s like, “Yeah, but come on, man, he’s having a rough time.” And I’m like, “Yeah, I get that. But he can’t just be roughing it in my place and making it his personal trash heap.”

So now, here I am. I kicked Dave out, but I’m not sure if I’m the bad guy here or not. Everyone’s telling me I should’ve been more patient. But like... it was a literal mess. I’m just wondering—AITAH for kicking Dave out because he’s too messy? Or was I right to just get him to clean up his act—literally?",1,1734021904.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1hcp7wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1hcp7wz/success_story/,Success story,"I have been in this reddit since I started online dating back in July and thought I will share my story to help people who are hopeful but are getting nowhere.
I joined online dating on bumble in July after my partner of 7 years decided to cheat on me for 6 weeks with a random girl he met during adhd meetup. At the time of breaking up (he initiated it) I was unaware of the cheating part, and we were still living together but just as flatmates. I decided to try online dating out of spite, trying to prove to myself and to him as well that I can find myself someone better. I met a guy who seemed really nice but he was full of red flags to which my newbie self-got trapped, he was giving me compliments straight away, inviting me out on a trip, sweet talking me, because I was new to this I had no clue that there is something off with this. We agreed to meet for the coffee – he stood me up, ghosted and then unmatched. I was heartbroken, I did not know what I did wrong, I was really upset with myself (I know now he was just being a dick).
Fast forward couple of weeks, and I saw a guy who wasn’t looking for a relationship but more just to chat, get to know someone etc. He was out of a relationship recently that was really long (13 years) and he felt like he was very isolated and alone. That was the main reason for me to swipe him, I thought it will be good to speak to someone who went through a similar experience to mine. We started chatting, and after few days decided to meet for friendly coffee. I was a bit hesitant after the first turning out to be a disaster but I gave it a shot. He did turn up and we spend over 5hrs just talking, turns out we have a lot in common. After meeting him I realised I’m actually not ready to look for anything romantic and we were both happy to keep things friendly and just chat. This went on for a few weeks, I am crazy about aurora hunting and this year in Scotland was truly marvellous for this, so when I was going out in the middle of the night I would let him know and often he would be up for going with me, so we ended up doing this few times together, again nothing romantic at that point. We had great conversations and every time we spent together was really happy and calm, I think we both needed that ‘no pressure, non-romantic’ type of friendship. I was going to drive to a small village about 2hrs away from the city we both live in, to take some photos and I invited him to come with if he had no better plans for his Saturday, as always he was keen and we took our dogs as well with us. After that trip I realised it would be amazing to share moments like this with someone and I texted that to him in a thank you message for joining me on the trip. And he texted me saying that he would like to date me too. That’s how we planned our first date, now it’s been over 3 months of us dating, and I have never been calmer and happier in my life, we get along so well, we understand each other, there is openness and honesty between us, we have been talking through potential issues, we even joked that the moment we will have a first proper argument we will have to celebrate because it is ridiculous how smooth sailing this has all been so far, I feel like all of the wounds I had after previous (very toxic in retrospective) relationship are healing, we are both so happy, spending most of the weekends together. Last week I just met his parents, and was invited for Christmas to their home and yesterday we got our first Christmas tree together. It’s been absolutely wonderful and it was worth all the pain and sadness that happened and got me to where I am. Do not give up – your person is there somewhere, and when you meet them it will be like nothing you ever felt before.

My output is roughly 8x as much as his. On top of that, he exhibits very annoying behaviors. Throughout the day, he behaves in the following ways: 
-Slurps his coffee every sip
-Chews loudly/smacks his lips while eating 
-Attempts to engage in pointless chit chat about the weather, current events, etc. He will even attempt to chat with me while I have my headphones on
-Ask me unintelligent questions about the job/life in general 
-Sing, hum, whistle, and talk to himself 
-Make loud noises by fumbling with papers, scratching, etc. 

On Mondays and Fridays the office is empty except the two of us. I go to a different floor to get away from him if I am feeling overwhelmed. It doesn't matter. He will still come to me and want to talk. I highly suspect he is on the Autism spectrum based on how he behaves. 

Ignoring and grey rocking him have not worked. How should I proceed? Do I just say, ""Dude, shut up?"" Do I tell my manager to have a talk with him? We work for two different companies supporting the same site, so we don't even have the same HR.

One such material is brass. Once seen predominantly in antique furniture, hardware, and fixtures, brass has experienced a dramatic resurgence in modern home decor. Its warm, golden hue, rich texture, and versatility make it an ideal element for reviving both vintage and industrial styles in contemporary interiors. [Brass](https://www.truegether.com/category/musical-instruments) is no longer just for old-world charm; it has found its place in modern, minimalist, and industrial-inspired spaces, blending old and new with remarkable ease.

**The Resurgence of Brass: A Look Back in Time**

Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, has been used for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Rome, where it was prized for its aesthetic and functional properties. Over time, brass became a prominent material in furniture, lighting, and hardware, particularly in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Its appeal in vintage design lies in its ability to age beautifully, developing a patina that speaks to its history.

In the mid-20th century, however, brass fell out of favor in the wake of modernist movements that favored more understated materials like stainless steel and chrome. But in the past decade, brass has made a strong comeback in the design world. According to a 2020 study by the American Society of Interior Designers, brass was one of the top 10 materials trending in modern interior design, with a notable rise in its use in lighting fixtures, furniture, and decor accents.

**Brass and Industrial Style: A Match Made in Heaven**

One of the reasons brass has made such a strong comeback is its perfect harmony with industrial-style interiors. The industrial style, which draws inspiration from factories and warehouses, celebrates raw materials like exposed brick, concrete, and steel. The beauty of brass lies in its ability to balance the rough, utilitarian nature of industrial spaces with its soft, warm glow.

Brass lighting fixtures, such as pendant lamps, chandeliers, and sconces, are making their mark in industrial-style kitchens, dining rooms, and living spaces. These lighting elements introduce an element of luxury and sophistication that contrasts beautifully with the raw and rugged surfaces typical of industrial design. For example, a sleek brass light fixture can be paired with a distressed wood dining table, exposed metal beams, and concrete floors, creating a space that feels both elegant and grounded.

**Stat Alert:** According to the 2022 ""Interior Design Materials Report,"" brass lighting fixtures were found in 30% of industrial-themed home renovations, reflecting its growing popularity in this aesthetic.

**Bringing Vintage Flair to Modern Spaces with Brass**

Brass isn't just reserved for industrial spaces—it also plays a crucial role in vintage and retro-inspired interiors. The vintage aesthetic often draws on the elegance and glamour of past decades, and brass can elevate the look of any room by adding a touch of old-world charm. From vintage-inspired furniture pieces, like brass-trimmed coffee tables and brass-framed mirrors, to accessories like candlesticks and vases, brass can be the perfect complement to the nostalgic elements of vintage design.

The revival of mid-century modern style, with its clean lines and minimalist approach, has also seen a resurgence in the use of brass. Mid-century furniture often featured brass accents, whether in the form of legs on chairs and sofas or knobs on drawers and cabinets. Today, designers are revisiting this period and incorporating brass into contemporary furniture, providing a nod to the past while keeping the overall aesthetic fresh and modern.

**Fun Fact:** The term ""mid-century modern"" was coined in the 1980s, and since then, the style has become one of the most sought-after design trends, with brass accents featured in many pieces. A 2021 report by Houzz revealed that 42% of homeowners renovating kitchens or living rooms opted for mid-century modern furniture, with brass features leading the charge.

**How to Incorporate Brass in Your Home**

If you're considering incorporating brass into your home, there are countless ways to do so, whether you're leaning towards a vintage, industrial, or even a more contemporary style. Below are a few creative ideas for integrating brass into your decor:

1.    **Brass Lighting Fixtures:** Whether you go for a bold statement chandelier or a set of elegant sconces, lighting is one of the easiest ways to bring brass into your space. A brass pendant light in the kitchen or a brass chandelier in the dining room can provide a luxurious touch without overwhelming the space.

2.    **Brass Furniture:** Brass accents can be added to your furniture, such as brass legs on mid-century modern tables or brass inlays on coffee tables and desks. These subtle touches create an understated elegance that doesn’t detract from the functionality of the furniture.

3.    **Brass Mirrors and Frames:** Brass-framed mirrors are a staple of vintage-inspired interiors, and they add a sophisticated, timeless feel to any room. Pairing them with vintage wallpaper or antique furniture can complete the look of a space.

4.    **Brass Decor:** Small decorative items, such as brass trays, vases, and candlesticks, can instantly elevate a room's aesthetic. A strategically placed brass accent can break up the monotony of neutral tones, creating a visual focal point that draws attention without overwhelming the space.

5.    **Brass Fixtures and Hardware:** Brass is a fantastic choice for faucets, cabinet hardware, and doorknobs, adding a sleek, metallic sheen to otherwise simple fixtures. These details make a big difference in the overall appearance of your home, offering a nod to both industrial and vintage design.

**Stat Alert:** A 2023 survey by ""Home Design Trends"" revealed that 58% of homeowners in the United States consider brass to be a top choice for kitchen and bathroom hardware due to its durability and aesthetic appeal.

**The Environmental Appeal of Brass**

In an era where sustainability and eco-conscious design are at the forefront of home renovations, brass has a unique appeal. Unlike many other metals, brass is highly durable and can be recycled indefinitely without losing quality. This makes it an eco-friendly choice for those looking to create sustainable, long-lasting interiors. Furthermore, the patina that develops on brass over time is a natural process, which many designers find beautiful as it adds character and depth to the material.

**Eco Fact:** Brass is 100% recyclable, meaning that old brass fixtures can be melted down and repurposed for new items, reducing the need for mining and new raw materials. In fact, brass is one of the most recycled metals in the world, with over 90% of all brass ever produced still in circulation today.

**The Future of Brass in Interior Design**

Looking ahead, the future of brass in interior design seems bright. As design trends continue to evolve, the demand for materials that offer both aesthetic appeal and sustainability will likely grow. Brass’s versatility ensures that it will remain a favorite for designers looking to create a blend of vintage charm and industrial edge. Whether in the form of statement furniture pieces, elegant lighting, or unique decor items, brass will continue to be a key player in shaping the interiors of tomorrow.

**Pro Tip:** If you're hesitant about using brass in large quantities, start small. Brass accessories, such as a vase, tray, or clock, can introduce this luxurious material into your space without overwhelming it. From there, you can slowly add more elements as you feel comfortable, ensuring that brass fits seamlessly into your design vision.

**Final Thoughts**

Brass has proven itself to be a timeless material that not only complements vintage and industrial styles but also adapts beautifully to contemporary design trends. Its unique combination of elegance, warmth, and durability makes it a standout choice for those looking to infuse their interiors with personality and sophistication. Whether you’re drawn to the raw beauty of industrial spaces or the timeless charm of vintage decor, brass is a versatile material that can seamlessly tie any room together. As it continues to shine in modern interiors, it’s clear that brass is not just a trend—it’s a classic that’s here to stay.

1hcp2dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hcp2dl/sf_the_tree/,[SF] The Tree,"Mariana and Oliver Tannenbaum hadn’t bought a Christmas tree in seven years. The imposition of watering it every two days and sweeping up its needles weekly just wasn’t a responsibility that made sense given their fantastic life.

Mariana was the CFO of Himalaya, an upscale outdoors brand whose best-selling item was an eleven hundred dollar fleece jacket lined with a thin layer of responsibly-harvested seal blubber. Oliver was a sought-after Santa Monica plastic surgeon who separated himself from his competition by making himself available for same-day all cash procedures in the event a celebrity woke up to discover something sagging.

Together the Tannenbaums had amassed a small fortune in only a decade of marriage. The highlight of each of those ten years was the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day, when they would escape their eight-thousand-square-foot home on the bluff above Pacific Coast Highway and spend six days mastering a new life skill from renowned experts in their field.

Three years ago, they traveled to New York City and made an award-winning short film with Spike Lee. Two years ago, they earned their private pilots’ license under the tutelage of Sully Sullenberger. And last year they met Hillary Clinton at her residence in Washington D.C. to master the art of diplomacy.

The Tannenbaums had long ago discovered that there isn’t much one can’t learn how to do quite well with one week and a few hundred thousand dollars.

So imagine Oliver’s dismay on December 17th when he returned home from performing an emergency buttock lift, opened a tall cardboard box waiting on the porch, and discovered it held a three-foot tall Christmas Tree. And not the standard pre-cut tree one might find in a parking lot, but a Berry Glen Living Christmas tree.

In a pot.

With soil.

And an instruction booklet.

“Oh no,” he uttered. Resting at the bottom of the empty box was a small Amazon gift receipt with a personal note: *“merry christmas tannenbaums. love, g”*

“g”? Who was “g”? They didn’t know a “g”!

Oliver opened a chat window with Amazon and typed in the 17-digit order number in the hopes of uncovering the giver’s identity.

*I am very sorry but this order was fulfilled by a third party vendor and therefore I do not have that information. Is there anything else I can help you with today?*

Oliver put in a request for a return.

*I am very sorry but live plants are not eligible for return. Is there anything else I can help you--*

Oliver closed the chat window and stared out at the Pacific. He was trying to remember the mantra his therapist assigned him at their Tuesday morning Zoom session when Mariana’s voice echoed off the vitrified tile entryway. “Who is g?!”

“I don’t know!” Oliver snapped back.

They set the sapling in the middle of the living room, but only after placing a Mauna Kea beach towel underneath it. The tree looked out of place. This room, after all, was reserved for Oliver’s most prized possessions: an electric guitar autographed by Green Day, an invisibility cloak used on camera by Elijah Wood in *Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, and an Emmy award he took in lieu of payment from an out of work ABC soap star with a droopy left eyelid.

Sensing the disparity, Mariana dredged up their lone bin of Christmas decorations from the crawl space above the champagne cellar and together they trimmed the evergreen with a single strand of white lights and a handful of ornaments. They agreed not to water it. They wanted it to be good and dead by the time they had to drag it up their long, steep driveway en route to their seven-night yachting adventure around the Galapagos Islands.

Less than twenty-four hours later, they knew something wasn’t right.

“Is our tree… bigger?” Mariana said. Oliver rolled his eyes at the comment, but that was mostly because they had recently completed their quarterly sex therapy session and Dr. Ashlee had explicitly told Mariana it wasn’t loving to point out the relative size of every object she sees. But upon closer inspection, Oliver couldn’t deny Mariana’s observation. The three-foot tall tree was now approaching five feet, and its black plastic pot was starting to bulge.

While the instruction book did not indicate the tree would nearly double in size within a day, it also didn’t stipulate that it wouldn’t. It was alive, after all. And Oliver and Mariana admittedly did not have much experience with living things. A look around the house revealed that: the artificial grass next to the pool, the bowl of fake lemons on the kitchen island, the breasts beneath Mariana’s blouse…

So they carried on as Christmas approached, distracted by office holiday parties and whether or not Mariana’s clinically-documented fear of reptiles would make it impossible for her to truly appreciate the Galapagos animal tour or if she should instead choose to spend day four of their trip learning the art of coffee roasting from indigenous Ecuadorian farmers.

They were awakened the night of December 20th to a crash in the living room. Oliver had imagined this moment many times, when a vagrant from the beach would carve a trail up the bluff and into their home, at which point Oliver would throw the intruder to the ground in a series of swift moves he had mastered during their 2017 holiday vacation — a six-day Brazilian jiu-jitsu intensive in Rio de Janeiro.

What Oliver found instead was that the top of their Christmas tree, now measuring over nine feet tall, had shattered the living room sky light.

Oliver looked at the mess and shook his head. “It’s time to call Carlos and Mateo,” he said.

Carlos and Mateo were the sibling handymen who tackled the home repair projects Oliver deemed too messy or labor intensive. They re-caulked showers. They unclogged drains. They assembled teak patio furniture. They rarely said a word and ate their lunch in their Toyota Corolla on the street. Oliver thought of them as the younger brothers he never had.

By the time they arrived the following afternoon, the pot had burst all over the cream-colored carpet and the tree had stretched another three feet, pushing itself through the sky light and making the evergreen visible above the roofline.

“*No problemo*,” Mateo said as he and Carlos stood in the driveway with saws in their hands.

Oliver planned to be there to supervise, but was stuck at work doing a last minute dermabrasion on an aging Backstreet Boy, a hiccup that left Mariana in charge. She watched with mixed feelings as they set the ladder against the house and climbed to the roof. The secret she hadn’t told her husband was that she *had* been watering the tree, two times a day, just as the instruction booklet stipulated. Mariana was oddly enraptured by the booklet and had read it cover to cover three separate times. She was drawn in by one sentence in particular:

*In time you will see there is nothing more satisfying than watching something you’ve nurtured steadily grow in strength and maturity.*

Was that true? She didn’t now. And yet she couldn’t deny that over the last few days she had experienced a surprising amount of joy in finding her little tree noticeably larger. Thus when Mateo raised his serrated blade to sever the top branch, Mariana lowered her head. But just as the carbide teeth touched bark, an officious voice behind her called out.

“Excuse me!”

She turned to see a city inspector speed walking toward them, I.D. flapping against his man boobs as his taxpayer-paid Prius blocked the driveway.

“I hope you have a permit for that.”

“A permit?”

“Any tree over ten feet tall in the Pacific Palisades requires community council approval,” he explained.

Mariana clarified that she’d be happy to comply, but this was merely a Christmas tree.

The inspector walked closer to the roof and squinted. He pointed with his clipboard to the ladder.

“May I?”

He climbed the ladder and shuffled on his hands and knees to Mateo and Carlos at the sky light. He looked through the hole. He circled the tree. He pinched off a twig. He shook his head.

“This is no Christmas tree,” he called down. “This is a Coast Redwood.”

“Does that matter?” Mariana asked.

“*Does that matter*?!” He looked at Carlos and snorted at Mariana’s ignorance. “This is the *state tree*. It’s protected. This flora isn’t going anywhere.”

“Bullllll… *shit*,” Oliver said via FaceTime when Mariana called him with the update. “Does he know that it’s not even planted in the ground?”

Mariana kept Oliver on the phone and tried that line of reasoning. But when she escorted the inspector to the living room to prove her point, they were shocked to see the tree had spread its roots past the beach towel, through the carpet, and into the floorboards of the house.

The inspector took the phone from Mariana. “As I was saying, Mr. Tannenbaum, you’re screwed.”

In ten years of holiday travel, they had never canceled a vacation. The closest they came was their 2015 trip to learn songwriting from Dianne Warren when Mariana had a panic attack halfway between Los Angeles and Nashville. Oliver gave her a quadruple dose of Lorazepam and had to drag her from the plane upon arrival, but when the drugs wore off ten hours later, she had a rush of creativity and wrote her best song of the week, an up tempo number called “My Mouth is Dry, but My Jeans Are Wet.”

“We have four days to get rid of that tree,” Oliver declared.

His solution was simple: ignore the threats and chop the damn thing down. In the worst case scenario, they would pay a penalty to the city and move on with life. Mariana calculated the potential cost to be much higher. After all, every employee at Himalaya, even she as the CFO, had to recite an environmental oath. *“Oh blue-green marble, how we marvel…”* it began. It included various do’s and don’ts and was updated monthly as new global threats surfaced. Killing a redwood was more than a fireable offense. It would likely void her pension as well.

Oliver couldn’t risk that. They needed her salary. It was the only way they would ever afford the Montana fly fishing cabin with the attached pickleball court he’d been eyeing on Zillow. Still, as the tree continued to grow, so did Oliver’s resentment for it. By the morning of the 22nd, it had taken out more of the roof and was approaching thirty feet tall. A layer of needles and sap was starting to cover everything in the living room. He moved his Green Day guitar and invisibility cloak and daytime Emmy to the bedroom and put in a call to the mayor’s office.

They didn’t see this as the emergency that he did.

“It’s out of control and destroying everything in its path,” he said.

“I thought you said this was a tree,” the staff member replied.

“Yes but it’s an evil tree!” he explained.

Mariana didn’t think the tree was evil. She thought it was majestic. She had been doing research on the Coast Redwood and shared some facts over dinner at Nobu.

“Did you know they are the tallest trees in the world?”

“Hmm.”

“Some of them are over two *thousand* years old. That means they were alive during the Roman Empire!”

“Crazy.”

“Oh, and they can capture fog in their needles and then use it to water the ground underneath. Isn’t that wild?”

No response. Unabashed, Mariana pushed on.

“I think we should name it,” she said.

“What? No,” he commanded.

“What if… I already did?”

“Damn it, Mariana.”

She waited for Oliver to ask the obvious follow up. He didn’t. They ate the rest of their sushi in silence and returned home to find the tree soaring fifty feet out of their house and into the moonlit sky. Mariana quietly smiled at the sight of it.

Oliver woke up the next morning, spent ten minutes in his custom plunge pool, and emerged with a fresh attitude. Their flight to Quito was scheduled to leave in forty-eight hours and he was not about to let the worst Christmas present ever ruin his favorite week of the year.

“Six days off the coast of Ecuador learning about natural selection is just the reset we need,” he said with confidence.

“What do we do about… the problem?” Mariana almost said the tree’s name but caught herself.

“We can deal with it when we get home. Honestly, how much bigger can a tree get?”

Shortly after this comment, the neighbors descended on the Tannenbaums’ portico. Unbeknownst to the Tannenbaums, the tree had experienced a growth spurt overnight and various people they had never met (but had thought seriously about meeting many times!) arose to find that their prized Pacific Ocean view was now blocked by a three hundred foot tall endangered species that hadn’t been there less than a week earlier.

They demanded action.

Oliver tried to calm them. He had gone down the angry route with the mayor’s office with nothing to show for it. *This situation requires tact*, he thought. It requires… *diplomacy*.

Oliver stood up straight. He was literally an *expert* in diplomacy! While the neighbors yelled at Mariana, Oliver slipped inside and found his notebook from his week with Hillary Clinton. He flipped through pages, desperate to find a nugget of wisdom that would bring an end to the tree drama.

“A firm ‘no’ can become a fast ‘yes’ if you find the right pressure point,” he declared with confidence as he returned to his wife and neighbors. This would have been more impactful if he also came armed with the actual pressure point, which he hadn’t. Thankfully, the awkward silence of the moment was drowned out by the twin engines of a Southwest flight, passing low overhead on its final approach into LAX. He looked into the sky and squinted. As the jet’s flight path traversed his tree, Oliver smiled. “And,” he added, pretending he knew where he was going with this from the very beginning, “if that tree reaches four hundred feet we could have some serious Class B airspace issues.”

Thankfully, Sully Sullenberger still had solid contacts at the FAA and was able to fast track their concern. The FAA quickly looped in Homeland Security. Homeland Security made an urgent phone call to the mayor. And by 2pm Pacific Standard Time, the city of Los Angeles issued a one-time waiver with the mutual support of the Pacific Palisades Community Council: the redwood could go.

Oliver made a note to call a tree service company the first week of January. In the meantime, he and Mariana would focus their energy on what mattered most: packing their bags and charging their portable neck fans.

“Which snorkel do you think I should bring?” Oliver asked. He owned three snorkels but had narrowed it down to two.

“They look the same to me,” Mariana answered.

They were obviously *not* the same. The black snorkel had a more efficient top valve but the blue snorkel had a more comfortable mouthpiece. Oliver headed to the pool to do a test run. After ten minutes, he was still undecided when he popped his head up and, through his mask, saw a middle-aged man in fatigues and a crew cut standing cross-armed on the patio, looking up at the redwood.

“This your conifer?”

“Yessir,” Oliver slurred through the snorkel.

“Impressive.” He stuck his right hand down toward the water line. “Colonel McGraw, Deputy Commander of the South Pacific Division. Army Corps of Engineers. I’ve been tasked with bringing this goliath to the ground.”

Oliver shook his hand. “Actually, I was going to handle that after the holidays.”

“You’re not handling anything,” the colonel said as he dried his hand on his pants. He turned his back on Oliver and strode around the perimeter of the yard, occasionally looking up at the tree for reference. By the time he was done, Oliver was out of the pool, toweled off, and definitely leaning toward the blue snorkel.

“Here’s my assessment, Mr. Tannenbaum. That tree is too damn tall to cut down in the traditional fashion. Chainsaws and whatnot. The reason being that no matter what direction it falls, it’s taking out multiple homes with it. Nice ones. I heard Pat Sajak lives in that mid-century modern down there.”

“He does?”

“And taking that into consideration, we are aiming for minimal impact here. You follow?”

“Yessir.”

“From my estimation our best bet is to go for a controlled demo.”

“And… how does that work?”

“Easy. My men bore holes in a series of strategic locations up and down the lower fifty of your tree. Two inches wide, eleven inches deep. Plug ’em with C4. Wire it up with det cord. Push a magic button. Tree goes boom. We’re all home by Christmas.”

Oliver nodded, trying to picture what he was describing. He had one concern.

“Won’t that damage *my* house?”

Colonel McGraw looked up at the tree then back down at the house. “I think we can save the kitchen.”

Oliver and Mariana spent Christmas Eve shuttling their many possessions to a storage facility off the 405 Freeway. It was a race to stay ahead of the engineers. By 7am, the Army Corps of Engineers had already set a perimeter. By 9am, sappers were drilling holes and stacking explosives. After a leisurely lunch at El Cholo, they were ready to wire. And by 3pm, it was time, as the colonel put it, “to blow shit up.”

Oliver gathered the last of his things. He carefully slid his *Lord of the Rings* cloak into his backpack and called for Mariana to meet him at the front door. She didn’t answer. For a moment he feared he had left her at the public storage in Inglewood, but his Life360 app told him she was still in the house. Specifically it showed that she was right in the middle of the living room.

But that was impossible. The only thing in the living room… was the tree.

*Oh no*, he thought.

Back in 2018, on the heels of seeing the mountain climbing documentary *Free Solo*, Oliver booked six days of intense training over the holidays with the film’s protagonist Alex Honnold. It was grueling, but Mariana took to it quickly. She was limber and strong. And each climb presented a new puzzle for her to solve; not with numbers and a spreadsheet to which she had grown accustomed at work, but with her fingers and toes. There was a tangible quality to the challenge.

Those memories came back to her on the ninth trip to the storage unit when she eyed her old climbing gear at the bottom of a plastic bin. But like the jiu-jitsu belt and the Spike Lee film and the Dianne Warren songbook, her passion faded. Those experiences may have been fun and enlightening and expensive, but they weren’t transformative.

Then came the tree. That needy, inconvenient tree. The booklet was right. Helping it rise out of that pot, through the roof, and into the sky filled her with a sense of accomplishment that dwarfed… well, everything. It took thirty-seven years but she finally had a sense of her deepest identity. Mariana Tannenbaum was a nurturer.

And so when the Army Corps of Engineers broke for lunch, Mariana dipped her fingers in her old chalk bag and started to climb. She didn’t attempt it in the naive hope she could save her tree. She simply wanted to relish in the small role she had played in making something transcendent—before it was gone forever.

The hardest part of the ascent was the initial fifty feet, but the holes drilled by the sappers left perfectly-spaced finger holds in the auburn trunk, and within twenty minutes she arrived at the bottom of the canopy. From there she climbed a branch at a time, moving in one direction around the redwood as if she were making her way up a giant circular staircase. She was at the top in under an hour. Alex Honnald would have been impressed.

Colonel McGraw, on the other hand, was pissed.

“What do you mean, your wife is *in* the tree?”

Oliver didn’t know what had drawn her into the branches. But the selfless part of him, a side that had long been dormant, knew he had to go after her.

“Listen, Tarzan,” the Colonel barked, “we are engineers, not search and rescue. I’ll delay this *one hour*, but if you go up there and get your ass stuck, that is not the government’s problem. Am I clear?”

“Yessir.”

McGraw started his timer and stomped off as Oliver began his own climb. He wasn’t the natural climber that Mariana was. Plus he didn’t have the benefit of chalk. To make matters worse, a marine layer was creeping in off the coast. By the time he reached the canopy, the branches were dewy and each step was precarious. A few slips and he resigned himself to the fact he couldn’t go any higher. He looked up through the needles and into the twilight.

“Mariana!”

Silence.

Was she stuck? Was she hurt? Did she fall and he didn’t know? He checked his watch. Only twenty-five minutes left before McGraw promised to blow them all away. Oliver straddled a sturdy bough and ran through all the impressive skills he had acquired in the last ten years. None prepared him for this. For the first time ever, Oliver Tannenbaum, vaunted Santa Monica plastic surgeon, faced a problem he could not fix.

The fog rolled in below the setting sun. With it came an ocean breeze that blew through the canopy. He heard a faint jingle. Oliver looked over his shoulder and, just within reach, was a silver ornament. One of the few he and Mariana had slapped on the tree a week earlier with little regard.

He plucked it off and held it in his hand. It was a small, square, photo frame with the words “Our First Christmas” engraved on the bottom. He and Mariana were in pajamas, standing close in front of a tiny Christmas tree they could barely afford. Oliver had his arms around Mariana’s waist. Behind them in the picture, next to the tree with a small pink bow on top, a stroller.

Oliver teared up. Remembering. This was the real reason they always fled L.A. after Christmas. The Tannenbaums weren’t chasing undiscovered joys. They were running from unresolved pain.

“Hey, stranger.” Mariana peered down at Oliver from the branch above. She was touched that he had come to rescue her, even if he was the one who needed to be rescued.

“You’re okay!” he said. She was okay. She was more than okay. Maybe it was the golden hour reflecting off her olive skin, but his wife of ten years looked younger to him. Renewed.

“We should probably get out of here, huh?” she said as she dropped onto his branch with a grace he didn’t possess. “Follow me.”

She started to head down but Oliver hung back.

“Betty,” he said.

Mariana looked back in surprise. “What?”

“You named the tree ‘Betty.’”

Mariana froze. It was the first time he had said the name in a decade. She was the one subject he was never willing to talk about. Which meant it was a subject they could never talk about.

“You know I’ve always loved that name,” she said. A tear met the edge of her smile.

“So have I,” he replied.

Oliver kissed her forehead and pocketed the ornament. With Mariana leading the way, the Tannenbaums were back on solid ground with two minutes to spare.

Colonel McGraw monitored their descent through binoculars from his reinforced steel barricade at the top of the driveway. He was relieved, mostly because their deaths would have created a lot of paperwork.

Oliver and Mariana joined him and were provided with Army-issue ear cans and eye protection.

“Thirty seconds,” the Colonel bellowed.

Oliver leaned in and yelled in Mariana’s ear. “So maybe no Christmas tree next year?”

Mariana laughed and held his hand.

Ten… nine… eight… seven… six… five… four… three… two… one.

KA-BOOM.

The base of the tree ignited in a series of flashing detonations starting at the bottom and moving upwards. And then, like a bolt of lightning in reverse, 100,000 volts of American energy shot through the wires, up through the canopy and out through its crown in an explosion so loud it interrupted spa treatments at the Burke Williams five miles to the south. For a few Newtonian-defying seconds, the tree didn’t move at all. And then it dropped, falling with the same unstoppable force with which it grew.

Colonel McGraw’s prediction turned out to be wrong. The tree did not spare the Tannenbaums’ kitchen. It flattened everything. The garage. The walk-in pantry. The home gym. The entertainment room. The craft room. The office. The other office. The hot sauna. The cold sauna. The indoor herb garden. The outdoor pizza oven. All of it buried under a six-foot pile of mulch.

When the dust cloud passed, Oliver and Mariana stood up. They weren’t sad. To their surprise, they were relieved. It was as if the tree had set them free to try again. To do things differently. To learn new lessons. Hopefully, the right ones.

“Incoming!” the Colonel yelled. They took shelter again as baseball-sized projectiles started to pelt them from above.

WHAM!

WHAM!

WHAM! WHAM!

Oliver and Mariana looked up from the barricade in awe.

Pine cones.

Thousands of them. Each one loaded with hundreds of redwood seeds.

They spread across the damp December sky in every direction, embedding themselves in backyards and in front yards.

In grassy parks and playgrounds.

Next to churches and behind schools.

On freeway medians and inside gated communities.

In flower beds.

And dirt lots.

And community gardens.

And on a bluff above Pacific Coast Highway.

Oliver laughed. Mariana’s heart swelled.",1,1734021353.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I know that’s a small amount but after not being able to get longer than 5 days since his rehab stay in September was definitely a win. He also started going to gym, going to school, and finally got a part time job. I knew not to get my hopes up because of how things have been going. 

I had a feeling something was going on when he got home extra late from work last night and I saw some extra 711 charges but assumed he probably worked late and maybe grabbed some soda on the way home to stay awake(he works to like 1am). I’ve been over thinking it all morning. I told myself I’m probably over reacting he’s been doing so good. I even wrote him (maybe in my own guilt) praising him for 2 weeks of sobriety and all the hard work he is doing.

Then I go take out the trash and just to make myself feel better check the green trash (where he usually hides alcohol when he drinks) and there sitting right on top of the leaves we picked up recently are beer cans. 
When he finds old stuff to throw away when he’s sober he often tells me so I don’t think he’s drinking so this is very obviously recent. 
I guess don’t go looking unless you want to know.

I considered texting him letting him knew I knew. Last time he drank he did some terrible things and I’m not over it honestly. 

And he just called me right now to talk about work and school and it was so hard to act like everything is ok. 

After the phone call it looks like he made another 711 charge. There’s nothing for him to buy there other than alcohol in the morning. We are stocked of energy drinks and coffee at home. So he might be drinking at school….

I’m going to try my hardest to just let it go. I know anytime I’ve mentioned something like that or brought up I knew he was drinking it caused a worse problem. I’m hoping if I let it go (until it becomes very obvious if he doesn’t stop) then he won’t continue to drink and I hope honestly that he feels guilty. 

I have a lot of faith and hope he will figure this out one of these days. He was sober a year before, I feel like I know he can do it again. I just also need to not add anymore judgement to him and cause more problems. While drinking again is very bad, he knows that, and doesn’t need me to tell him. ",6,1734020998.0,AlAnon,4,1.0,False

I've always said that my boy taught me so much about love and companionship in his 17 years of life, and I'm discovering in this time post-him that he's teaching me so much about grief. Namely, that it's not something we overcome or ever fully heal from. But rather that it's something that sits with us daily.

I wake up with my grief. Have my morning coffee with my grief. Work with my grief. Smile and laugh with my grief. My grief sits with me at the dinner table. And it's in bed beside me at night. It fills every part of my life where he was.

I think, though, that I've reached a point where I welcome my grief and that deep longing for him that I know I'll never be able to fill. It's a testament to how much I loved him and still love him.

I worked at a popular coffee chain with a busy  drive thru. It was a sunny morning, the birds were chirping, and some asshole was laying on his horn in my drive thru.

I never did figure out why he started. Maybe he thought she cut him off pulling in. Maybe she was too slow pulling forward. Maybe she took too long at the menu board. It didn't really matter. By the time she got to the drive thru window, she was Done With His Shit in the way a teacher or a mom might be with a misbehaving, loud child.

She was a put-together middle aged woman with a smooth gray bob. I told her the total and she gave me her card and said, ""I'd also like to pay for the gentleman behind me.""

We shared a smile. I'm sure you can imagine the looks on our faces.

I got her on her merry way and he pulled up, red-faced and huffing. In my most cheerful customer service voice, I said, ""the woman in front of you actually paid for your coffee! You don't have to give me anything.""

Y'all. His. Brain. Broke.

He started questioning me. ""What do you mean? Why can't I pay for the coffee? Just charge me for my coffee.""

I played along as best I could, cheerful smile plastered across my face. ""This coffee is all paid for, but I'd be happy to make you another one if you'd like to pay for something!""

We went in circles like this for a solid minute or two before he, even more pissed off than before, slammed on the gas and screeched his way out of the parking lot. I'm sure he went on to take out his misery on many more people that day.

1hcoosn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1hcoosn/seeking_advice_cat_with_urinary_issues/,Seeking Advice - Cat with urinary issues,"Looking for a second opinion regarding my cat, Coffee. He is a 14 months old domestic short hair, neutered, about 15 lbs (not overweight, him and his brother are just BIG boys), polydactyl, otherwise healthy, active, and playful, eating and drinking normally. Indoor only cats. Up to date on all vaccines. His brother (litter mate) has not shown signs of any health issues at all, other than being more prone to gaining weight lol. We live in New Jersey if that matters.

Background: 
At the beginning of September Coffee went to the bathroom one day, came out yowling and aggressively licking his privates. I'm very aware that urinary issues are one of the most common problems in cats, so I knew what signs to look for. I brought him to my general vet immediately. Upon exam he seemed fine, no signs of blockage. They gave him antibiotics and pain medication. Blood test showed normal kidney function. There were some items out of normal range, but vet wasn't concerned. Urinalysis came next day, there were struvite crystals and blood in his urine. Vet gave the treatment of switching to a prescription diet for urinary care. I switched him (and his brother) to Hill's c/d urinary care diet, dry and wet food. Also started adding water to their dry food. 

Now, 2 months later, it was time to do another urinalysis to see if the diet got rid of the crystals. I put him in the bathroom alone with an empty litter box to get the urine sample, checking on him every 10-15 min. He quickly peed in the box, but it was a very small amount, less than 1ml, and clearly had a decent amount of blood in it, the urine itself was pink. I collected the sample, cleaned the box, and kept him in there to hopefully get another sample. Repeat this cycle 5 times, about every 15-20 minutes, him peeing only a small amount each time. I finally have a large enough sample for the urinalysis, and I let him out. He immediately started playing and acting normal, ate his dinner normally and everything. I called the vet in the morning to tell them I'm going to drop off the sample, but explain what happened. They wanted to see him to make sure it's not kidney stones.

I bring him to the vet the next day, they do an exam and take x-rays. Everything appears normal. No signs of pain or distress, empty bladder (no blockage), x-rays look clear, no signs of kidney stones. The vet gave him a shot of antibiotics again, just in case, and he got his FVRCP and rabies vaccines. Urinalysis comes back, the crystals decreased, but the amount of blood in the urine increased. The vet asks about if he has access to contaminated water or food, I say no, they're indoor cats and only have fresh water (I have one of those water fountains if that matters) and food. He asks if he's eating anything outside of the Hill's diet, I say no, that has been 100% of his diet for the past two months. His only suggestion is to switch to Royal Canin urinary diet, says that Hill's isn't as good and that's probably the problem. I tried pressing to do further testing, he says no, switch the diets and we'll test again after a month of him being on the Royal Canin diet.

I've attached screenshots of both urinalysis results and the blood test from the first visit. I don't have the x-rays, but I did look at them at the vet and he showed me that there were no signs of stones in his kidneys. I am taking him to a urinary specialist for a second opinion, but they cannot see him until the end of January. I'm hoping someone here can give their opinion on what may be the issue. I may just be a nervous pet parent, but I have lost pets in the past due to not catching an illness in time, one of which was a cat when I was young that we lost when he was only 2 years old (FIP). I have some PTSD from pet loss that has made me an overly anxious pet parent as an adult now. I'm so worried about not catching something in the early stages. And I also don't want my babies to be in pain and I don't know it. I just want to take care of them as best I can. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
