Recently I was talking to someone I liked. We had a spontaneous date — just coffee for about 30 minutes, really early in the morning because that’s when we were both free. I wasn’t extremely dressed up, but I thought I looked at least nice.
After that, he started acting distant. Before, he was so sweet when we talked, and now he barely replies. It feels so weird to think that 30 minutes were enough for him to lose interest in me.
What hurts is that I don’t think I’m physically awful, and I know my personality isn’t the worst either. But still, it feels like nobody can love me. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me.
I also feel stupid because tomorrow I turn 22 and I’ve never experienced what romantic love feels like.",1,1756349662.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I try to explain it’s literally mine, I just bought it, but she’s not having it. She leans over, pokes my cup, and goes, “Nope, that’s clearly a barista cup. You must work here.”

At this point I’m laughing but also kinda annoyed. I repeat I don’t work here, show her my hoodie and jeans (nothing Starbucks-y lol) and she goes, “Well if you don’t wanna help customers maybe you shouldn’t be in the store!”

Finally a real barista comes over and she tells him I’m refusing to help her. The barista just looks at me, looks at her, and deadpan says, “Ma’am… he doesn’t work here.”

**1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams, One Slightly Less Doomed**  
The KBO showdown between the KT Wiz and Lotte Giants is a statistical tightrope walk. On the moneyline, the Giants are the faint favorites at **-111** (decimal: 1.83, implied probability: **54.6%**), while the KT Wiz hover at **+105** (decimal: 1.91, implied **52.3%**). It’s like choosing between two slightly less terrible Uber drivers: both might get you lost, but one has a slightly better Yelp rating.

The spread? The Giants are -1.5 (-150, implied **60%**) and the Wiz are +1.5 (-400, implied **80%**). That line feels like a cruel joke—betting on the Giants to outscore a team by 1.5 runs is like betting your toddler will eat *more* vegetables than a vegan. The totals are a clean 8.0 runs, even money (1.87 odds). If you’re feeling spicy, the Over and Under are as balanced as a Korean BBQ platter—equal parts protein, equal parts chaos.

**2. Digest the News: Singers, Retirees, and a Hamster Wheel of Drama**  
Let’s unpack the “news” here. First, the KT Wiz and Lotte Giants are technically *not* the teams in the retirement tour article (that’s Samsung vs. Doosan), but we’ll let it slide. Still, the fact that O Seung-hwan—the “final boss” of Korean pitching—is retired from action but training with his team adds a bittersweet layer. It’s like your favorite coffee shop barista retiring but still showing up to make lattes… just to watch.

Meanwhile, the YouTube broadcast features trot singer Lee Chan-won hyping the KT Wiz and K-Will cheering for the Giants. Imagine a cooking show where Gordon Ramsay and a guy named “Will” argue over whether your scrambled eggs

I don’t know what they’re talking about with the lychee and mandarine because this is a blueberry bomb

The beans smell like blueberries, the grounds smell like blueberries, the wet aroma is blueberry poptart filling and the cup aroma is just blueberry 

The taste is blue berry, açai berry and white floral. It’s an incredible experience

I’ve had Sidamas before and they always taste like this. I regret getting only 70g cuz now they’re sold out :(

As my other coffees I got their Panama medium roast and kerehaklu anoxic washed light roast. Those were good, but this is something else

I also had the Sidama from GB roasters earlier this year, and it was very similar, but it also had a nuttiness to it and it was a lot more complex, but it wasn’t as fruit forward as this, still very similar.

# Choosing The Right Coffee Beans

Brewing low acid coffee starts with the right beans. Picking the correct variety can reduce acidity. This choice is crucial for a smoother cup. Let’s dive into the best options available for low acid coffee enthusiasts.

# Selecting Low Acid Varieties

Some coffee beans naturally have lower acidity. Opt for beans grown at lower elevations. These beans often have milder flavors and are less acidic. Sumatra and Brazil are regions known for low acid beans. They produce rich, earthy coffee with minimal bite.

Consider trying coffee labeled as “low acid.” Brands often offer specific varieties for sensitive stomachs. They focus on reducing acidity without sacrificing taste. Experiment with these options to find your preferred flavor profile.

# Organic Vs. Conventional Options

Organic coffee beans can offer a cleaner taste. They are grown without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. This can enhance flavor and reduce potential irritants. Organic options are often available in low acid varieties.

Conventional beans might be more accessible. They can also offer diverse flavor profiles. Comparing both can help you decide based on taste and health priorities. Many coffee lovers enjoy the depth of flavor in organic beans.

First dates can feel like a mix of excitement and nerves. You want to make a great impression, keep the conversation flowing, and avoid that dreaded awkward silence. 

But let’s be real—sometimes finding the *right* thing to say feels harder than it should. 

That’s where conversation starters come in. Having a few reliable topics in your back pocket can turn a stiff, formal date into something natural, fun, and memorable.

Discover 12 conversation starters to break the ice on a date, along with tips, examples, and best practices to help you relax and connect. 

Whether you’re shy, inexperienced, or just want to keep the night interesting, these conversation ideas will make things smoother.

# 1)) Ask About Their Favorite Travel Experience

Travel is a safe, exciting, and universal topic that sparks curiosity. People love sharing stories about places they’ve been or destinations they dream about. 

This kind of question also gives you a glimpse into someone’s sense of adventure, lifestyle preferences, and even their values.

Tips to use this starter effectively:

* Instead of asking “Do you like to travel?” (which often gets a yes/no answer), try something more specific: *“What’s the best trip you’ve ever taken?”*
* Listen for details you can build on. If they mention hiking in Peru, you can ask about what inspired them or what food they tried there.
* Be prepared to share your own travel story as a way to keep the exchange balanced.

Example Swipe:

* “If you could get on a plane tomorrow with a free ticket, where would you go and why?”

This approach opens doors to lighthearted banter and shared excitement about future adventures.

# 2)) Talk About Food Favorites

Food is always a winner because it’s relatable, sensory, and fun. Everyone has opinions about what they like to eat, where they enjoy dining, and what new flavors they’d like to try. 

On a date, food talk also sets up opportunities for planning future outings together.

Checklist to make this topic engaging:

* Ask about their favorite type of cuisine: “Are you more into sushi nights or comfort food?”
* Get playful with “Would you rather” food scenarios: “Would you rather give up coffee for a year or never eat pizza again?”
* Find common ground—if you both like Italian food, you can naturally suggest trying a local spot on your next date.

Best Practice: Keep food talk lighthearted. Avoid launching into strict diets, calorie counts, or controversial food trends unless they bring it up first.

# 3)) Share Funny or Awkward Childhood Stories

Humor is one of the best icebreakers. When you open up about a silly childhood memory, you make yourself relatable, approachable, and easy to talk to. 

This type of conversation quickly builds comfort and shows that you don’t take yourself too seriously.

Ideas for stories to share:

* The first time you tried to impress your crush in middle school.
* A family tradition that seemed weird as a kid but hilarious now.
* Embarrassing fashion choices from your teenage years.

Pro Tip: After sharing your story, ask them: *“What’s one funny or awkward memory from when you were younger that still makes you laugh?”* This permits them to laugh at themselves, too.

# 4)) Ask About Their Hobbies or Passions

People light up when they talk about what they love. Hobbies, passions, or creative outlets are safe ground to uncover their personality, interests, and lifestyle. 

It’s also a way to find out if you share common activities.

Tips for digging deeper:

* Instead of simply asking, “What do you do for fun?” phrase it like: *“What’s something you could spend hours doing and never get tired of?”*
* Ask follow-ups: If they say painting, ask how they got started or what style inspires them.
* Share something you’re into, even if it’s simple, like hiking or gaming, to keep the exchange mutual.

Warning: Don’t judge or dismiss their interests, even if they’re not your thing. Showing genuine curiosity is what matters.

# 5)) Discuss Movies, Shows, or Books They Enjoy

Entertainment is an easy win for conversation. It’s light, fun, and can spark debates or laughter without too much pressure. 

You’ll quickly see whether they enjoy comedies, thrillers, rom-coms, or documentaries, and that insight can help you understand their personality.

Ways to make this topic flow:

* Ask: *“What’s the last movie you saw that actually stuck with you?”*
* Bring up current shows or classics to see if you share tastes.
* If they love books, dive into genres or authors.

Engagement Hack: Turn it into a playful game: “If you could only watch one show for the rest of your life, what would it be?”

# 6)) Explore Their Dream Job or Career Goals

This one works best if you keep it light and avoid making it feel like a job interview. 

Many people enjoy talking about their ambitions, career paths, or even side hustles. It also helps you learn what drives them.

Best Practices:

* Ask about passions, not positions: *“If money wasn’t an issue, what would you be doing with your life?”*
* Be encouraging—showing genuine interest makes people feel seen.
* Share your own vision for your future, even if it’s not perfectly figured out.

This conversation can deepen the connection by revealing values and dreams beyond surface-level chatter.

# 7)) Talk About Music

Music connects people instantly. Asking someone about their favorite bands, concerts, or playlists can turn into hours of conversation. 

It’s also a natural way to discover shared vibes.

Swipe Examples:

* “What’s a song you could never get tired of hearing?”
* “Do you have a concert you’ll never forget?”
* “What’s your go-to playlist when you’re working out or relaxing?”

Pro Hack: If you discover shared music tastes, suggest making a joint playlist as a fun way to connect after the date.

# 8)) Ask About Pets or Animals They Love

Pets are often an emotional topic. Whether they have a dog, cat, or even dream of owning a pet one day, asking about animals can warm up the atmosphere quickly.

Ideas to make this fun:

* “Are you a dog person, cat person, or neither?”
* Share a funny pet story from your own life.
* If they don’t have pets, ask about animals they admire or would love to have.

Checklist:

* Be careful not to dominate with endless stories about your pet—balance is key.
* If they light up about their pet, ask to see a picture. This creates a moment of bonding.

# 9)) Bring Up Bucket List Adventures

Bucket lists are naturally exciting to talk about. They reveal someone’s sense of adventure, curiosity, and life goals. 

Plus, these conversations create opportunities to laugh, dream, and even discover shared ambitions.

Starter Questions:

* “What’s one thing you absolutely want to do before you turn 40?”
* “If you had unlimited time and resources, what’s the first adventure you’d chase?”

personalities Use this as a way to gauge compatibility. If their idea of adventure is skydiving and yours is reading in a mountain cabin, that’s still fine—it just gives you insight into each other’s personalities.

Games are underrated as conversation tools. A light round of “Would you rather” questions can break the tension, spark laughter, and reveal quirky details about someone’s personality.

Examples of fun prompts:

* “Would you rather never use social media again or never watch TV shows again?”
* “Would you rather live by the beach or in the mountains?”
* “Would you rather always have to sing instead of speak, or dance everywhere you go?”

Best Practice: Keep it playful and avoid extreme or uncomfortable questions. This is about breaking the ice, not crossing lines.

# 11)) Ask About Their Family or Upbringing (Lightly)

Family talk can be meaningful, but you’ll want to keep it light early on. Asking about someone’s background or upbringing shows genuine interest without being too heavy.

Examples:

* “Where did you grow up? What was it like there?”
* “Do you have siblings? What’s your relationship like?”
* “What’s a family tradition you still keep?”

Warning: If they seem uncomfortable, change the topic quickly. The goal is connection, not pressure.

# 12)) Talk About Future Plans and Life Goals

Ending with a forward-looking topic makes the date feel inspiring and optimistic. 

It helps you both imagine what’s possible and creates a sense of shared momentum.

Ideas to keep this upbeat:

* “What’s something you’re looking forward to in the next few months?”
* “What’s a goal you’ve set for yourself recently?”
* “If you could learn one new skill this year, what would it be?”

Tip: Keep it balanced. Don’t interrogate them about marriage or kids on a first date, but do explore the lighter side of dreams and ambitions.

# Conclusion

Breaking the ice on a date doesn’t have to be nerve-wracking. With these 12 conversation starters, you’ll always have a way to keep the energy flowing, avoid awkward silences, and build a real connection. 

The key is not just asking questions but listening, following up, and sharing a little bit of yourself, too.

Great conversations aren’t about perfection—they’re about presence. Stay curious, stay open, and let the conversation unfold naturally.",1,1756349207.0,LifeStylenaireLove,0,1.0,False

McDonalds Pet Peeve Edition (USA),"So I’m listing a few of my huge things that really got me frustrated while at work and they are in NO PARTICULAR ORDER, but I want to see if I’m going insane here or if you all feel me here:

1: The plastic on the creamer is there still when it’s cut or the creamer isn’t cut short enough. I don’t care who changes it or what but if you’re going to change it PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE SURE THE PLASTIC IS REMOVED AND ITS CUT PROPERLY! You never know when inspection is coming and if that’s there and you don’t catch it then whoops there goes points out the door for one stupid mistake.

2: Things going missing or you can’t find anything when you go to open service/grill. So there is a time where I went to open service and I went to get all the things I needed to open and I was missing a few things, the lemon container that I LOVE to use and the McCafe creamer drain where I can sit the cup for iced coffees and oatmeal on so I don’t make a huge mess. Like if you’re going to close the store please make sure EVERYTHING is put away CORRECTLY and WHERE IT BELONGS. And to my unfaithful surprise I heard both was thrown away and god forbid I was mad about it since I have to like be extra careful to not a mess.

3: This is my biggest one and I’m listing it last so here goes, the whole restaurant is a huge mess and nothing was cleaned or stocked before closing the store. There was a HANDFUL of times where I’d go to open for the morning and when I’d walk in I was shocked ( in a very bad way ) the whole restaurant was left a huge mess and I spent my ENTIRE prep time cleaning and opening service at the SAME time. Mind you I have to brew all the tea and coffee make sure THINGS are stocked and ready to go in both McCafe and front line so I can have a swift opening and all. Like how come nothing was done when the store had ENOUGH closers to do shit? Like I 100% hate the one closing manager bc of this. How can anyone consider that clean and a proper close like ngl she needs either written up or fired she’s did this multiple times leaving the store a mess and clearly no one isn’t DOING anything about it?

Now you all tell me am I alone going insane or am I not alone I figured I share my most frustrating pet peeves I’ve developed while being there.

I stopped drinking anything with caffeine aboutttt a year and a half-two years ago. My stools were almost always on the verge of being diarrhea-ish when I drank coffee daily.   When I stopped cafeine, my stools were normal, no diarrhea at all.

The past 2-ish months, I've been drinking one coffee once a week. I notice for 2-3 days after I drink that coffee, my stomach rumbles a lot and I'm back to having diarrhea or near diarrhea like stools every time I go to the bathroom.  
So I'm definitely seeing a connection I think...

I'm just wondering if this is the case or anyone else - does coffee give you diarrhea?  
Definitely planning on stopping again cause omg... diarrhea is not fun. ",1,1756349056.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I’ll remember little fragments of myself, and then it’s gone. That flow of experience I used to have, is gone.

I don’t feel time passing, what season it is, or how many hours pass in a day. I don’t feel grounded at all, but I’m not anxious or panicked. I will get these “mental” anxiety loops but never panic. It’s like my body has no response to anything - music, memories, thoughts, interactions with others. 

The only time I feel a little bit is when I get angry at something, but I still don’t feel like myself. It’s like I’m observing someone else get angry. And it doesn’t last. It’s like a flicker then gone. 

I started having intrusive thoughts again tonight that I could just disappear or go crazy. But I don’t panic, I just have the thoughts but don’t feel the fear in my body. My body basically has no reaction to anything anymore, internally or externally.

I don’t see anyone else describe this numbness, this inability to react, this sense of being hollow and devoid of any sort of memories, emotions and connection to the world.

Sweat beads lined the edge of my forehead as I struggled to keep my eyes fixated on the newspaper that shielded my eyes from the woman sitting across from me.
 
“It’s like you don’t love me anymore, darling. Did I do something wrong?’

Her leg shot up underneath the table, and her foot grazed my shin and right knee. I heard the water droplets drip down onto the floor as she rubbed her foot up and down against my leg. 

“Pleaaseee, darling. Won’t you look at me?’ she begged 

I sipped my coffee shakily and adjusted the newspaper in my hand. My heart thumped to the beat of a machine gun while my wife’s chipped and dirty nails clicked and clacked atop our dining room table. You see, it’s not that I didn’t want to see her; I loved my wife with all of my heart and soul. She was my rock, my support beam, and I’d give anything to have her back. Well, the *real* her. Because the person sitting before me today was *not* my wife. 

My wife was an angel. An illuminating light in my world of darkness. What happened to her was tragic and completely unjust, but it was also my fault. I was the reason behind her accident, the reason why she put on her stunning wedding gown one last time before throwing herself off the highest bridge in our city, and plummeting to her death in the watery grave below. 

We argued, and I said some things I didn’t mean; dear God, I want to take them back, but I can’t. I’m stuck, I’m imprisoned here with this, this, imposter. This sacrilegious thing that has taken the place of my wife. I was drunk and I told her I didn’t think she was attractive, and I’m sorry, okay?! I’m sorry for what I’ve done. She knows I thought she was beautiful, I know she knows it, she *has* to know, right? 

“Donavinnnnn..you’re still not looking at meee,” 

I was at my breaking point, and tears began to sting my eyes. Her cold, grey hand reached over and caressed the edge of my newspaper, leaving dark, wet streaks running down the length of it. She ran her hand across the top back and forth, and eventually the paper grew soggy and damp in my hands. The corners began to fold in, and my wife’s decaying face started forcing its way into view. 

With one flick of her broken wrist, she pushed the paper, and the whole thing slumped over in my arms. 

Maggots ate away at her face, and gaping black wounds etched the sides of her neck. Her eye sockets were completely black and hollow, but the worst part of all was her mouth. Her jaw was dislocated, yet her words came out so fluently, filling the room with the stench of rotting meat each time she spoke.

“Aren’t I pretty, Donavin? Don’t you love me?”

Her pouts grew into sobs, which eventually mutated into distorted wails. Ear-splitting screams that only I could hear. 

She’s still wearing her beautiful wedding dress, the silky white now coated with mucus and mud.

I love my wife. I miss my wife. Lord, forgive me for what I’ve done to my wife.

Which means I’ve been down in the dumps, low energy, & I had been on a steroid for the sickness for 5 days & now on a z pack of antibiotics ( on my 2nd day of them). 
I took my adderall for the first time today because I really needed to clean my house and just get all the things done I haven’t been able to do in the last couple weeks. I’m on immediate release 1 pill 20 mg twice a day. Usually on my normal schedule I only take 1 a day because it seems to get me through the day, on the days I need the extra push or just have more to do I take both. So today I took both, and now I feel soooo shitty. I got so light headed so quick, definitely felt like I was going to pass out, shit myself, and throw up. Nothing happened except for me getting extremely shakey and my legs and my arms going numb and tingly. I feel clammy and hot and cold, sweating and then have the goose bumps. Everytime I try to sit up or walk around I feel extremely weak and lethargic. I thought maybe because I only had a small breakfast, a coffee, and a couple sips of an energy drink that, barely  any water that that was the problem. I tried eating something both salty and sweet and can’t seem to even work up the will to eat. I’ve drank a lot of water, now just trying to breathe and sit for a bit. Was it a combination of all of that? Did I give myself too much caffeine and spark too much adrenaline? & this is a bad adrenaline crash? Did I give myself serotonin syndrome by not having my adderall in forever and taking both of them right off the bat? Is it my antibiotics clashing with them?

1n20nsk,https://i.redd.it/y4d98h21aolf1.jpeg,Looking for someone special in Greeley,"Hey there — I’m 24, originally from southern Louisiana but I’ve called Greeley home since 2019. Life has been a journey for me: I’m a proud dad to two amazing little ones (1 and 2) from my previous marriage, a combat veteran (Army, deployed to Syria in 2021), and now I work hard between two jobs — nights in sanitation at JBS and another during the day. Keeps me busy, but I wouldn’t trade the drive I have.

I follow Reform Judaism, lean conservative politically, and at heart I’m very much a classic southern gentleman. I believe in being kind, respectful, romantic, and making the people around me smile. My friends and family would tell you I’m the kindest person they know — goofy when the mood is right, but also ambitious and serious about my goals.

Sports and fitness are a big part of my life — I love basketball (NBA and college), college football (Geaux Tigers), and I’ve been on a serious fitness journey this year. Since January, I’ve dropped from 253 lbs down to 183. Running has become a passion, and I’m training for marathons now, with ultrarunning in sight for next year.

So what am I looking for? A real connection here in Greeley. Someone who enjoys laughter, good conversation, and maybe doesn’t mind a little southern charm now and then. A first date could be as simple as coffee or a walk in the park — I think the best connections start simple and grow naturally.

If you’re looking for someone genuine, kind, and maybe just a little old-fashioned in the best ways, I’d love to hear from you. Who knows — maybe I’ll make you laugh, and maybe you’ll be the reason I smile a little bigger every day.

1n20nor,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1n20nor/ncl_aqua_5_day_bermuda_trip/,NCL Aqua - 5 day Bermuda Trip,"Reviews on recent NCL Aqua trip: 

1. Cabins - we had an interior room mid-ship Deck 11 (directly below the medical center). It was very quiet. Lots of storage space - 3 separate closet spaces + large drawers under TV area, shelves next to mirror/vanity area, and bathroom storage. The cabin felt roomy. We did not ask them to separate the beds and felt like we had plenty of space with the larger bed. Shower felt HUGE and also had shelves for toiletries, foot rest for shaving legs. 
-One thing I’ve seen mentioned before and we did notice by the end of the trip - unfortunately, we could smell sewage starting the last 2 days of the trip. This did not become unbearable but I would be nervous if it was a longer cruise and we had to continue dealing with this smell. 

2. Food and service - mediocre. All of the staff we encountered were working hard and they seemed to have plenty of people but lots of things were moving SLOW. 
We got to Main Dining Room around 8pm. It closes at 9pm. It took quite a while for our order to be taken and then we waited long periods between courses. We did not get served our main course til after 9pm and almost skipped dessert entirely. They were still seating people at 9pm. Sister had steak medium-rare and it was impossible to cut with steak knife. 

The Local - we tried the bar area a couple times which serves snack food. The bartenders were working hard especially on embarkation day and they made excellent drinks. On day 2ish, we sat at a table next to the bar and ordered two snacks - loaded nachos and spinach and artichoke dip. We waited for more than an hour and our food never came, waitress disappeared. We finally gave up. We did try this again on day 4 and our drinks and snacks were delivered promptly (although it was less busy at the time). Spinach dip tasted like the kind you get frozen and just heat up. We also tried breakfast at The Local one morning around 10. This was a poor choice on our part because we were docked in Bermuda and the ship was doing a crew drill training session starting at 9:30. Probably 90% of the workers were involved with the drill so service was slow and chaotic. They also wouldn’t allow us to re-enter from the ocean walk area since they were closing fire doors, and shut down the elevators a few times during this time. 

Onda by Scarpetta - Italian. Nothing to write home about. We had 5:30 reservations and they wouldn’t let us near the doors until 5:35. We were seated outside. Burrata appetizer was good. Only one other table outside was seated so our waiter was attentive but again, slow service. 

SukoThai - we had 5:30 reservations (when they open) and were able to get a great table with a view by the window. The restaurant area feels small and if you are seated in the larger back portion, you don’t have a view at all. Spring rolls were tasty. We weren’t a fan of the chicken satay. The salt and pepper prawns were just tempura shrimp so if you like fried shrimp, then it’s good lol Dessert was delicious - fried bananas with ice cream. 

Indulge Food Hall - we did not have great food here either. The tablets you use to order were glitchy and as others have noted, although there are many tables outside, there are no tablets there. The space inside was crowded and it felt like they shoved a chair into every inch of space so you couldn’t easily get in/out of your table. Lots of bar seating but at those tablets you can only order the food served in that section. Everything you order comes out individually at random times. Things did seem to move quicker here.   As far as we could tell, the options you could order here didn’t change much even from lunch to dinner. They also close Indulge from around 2:30-5 everyday. We were unable to order desserts on the tablets - there was a prompt to go to the dessert section to look at what the options were. There is an outdoor bar at the back of Indulge which never seemed busy when we passed. And also an outdoor self-serve soft serve ice cream machine. 

The Buffet (Surfside Cafe) - complete and utter chaos. The walkways were far too narrow and unlike on previous ships, there is only one small section for each food offering. The staff that were helping to move things were actually just standing in the way and yelling at people to go sit in the specialty restaurant section. But most people standing on the walkway were actually just trying to get food, not find a seat. A lot of the flavor combos and food served seemed random like they were just using leftovers. There were a couple times in the afternoons where only the “Grill” section in the back was open, serving various hamburgers, hot dogs, fries, and condiments. This wasn’t always open through dinner though. There is a water bottle filling section and plenty of ice water, juice, and coffee stations throughout the buffet. 
Observation Lounge - this is on the opposite side of deck 17 and is all indoors with a great view of the ocean. There is a bar (only open during certain hours) and an area that has “light breakfast” I think from 10-12:30ish? and snacks from 2:30-4:30ish. On the days I went the breakfast included coffee, juice, mini pastries (croissants, muffins, danishes), cereals, yogurt, and egg bites. The afternoon snacks included a couple varieties of quiche, scones, and cookies. 

Bars - open different hours for each but all seems good. The Improv Bar doesn’t have an espresso machine so can’t do espresso martinis. Most of the bars could do frozen drinks. Even when crowded we never had to wait more than a few minutes for drinks.

I’m planning a 2-week stay in NYC this September as a trial run to see what living there might feel like. I’m thinking of splitting my time between East Village, Williamsburg, and Astoria to get a mix of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.

A few things I’m hoping to do:
- Catch both a Yankees and a Mets game
- Hit a few touristy spots (museums, maybe a Broadway show, landmarks)
- Explore the neighborhoods more organically — walking around, checking out local restaurants, bars, etc.
- Work remotely from cafes and coffee shops to get a sense of the day-to-day vibe

Questions:
1. What’s a realistic budget for 2 weeks all-in (housing, meals, transport, entertainment)?
2. Any recommendations for must-visit spots in those neighborhoods specifically?
3. Any “things to know” that someone considering a move should keep in mind during a short stay like this?

I’m in mid/late 20s, and want to balance doing some classic NYC stuff with just getting a feel for what everyday life would be like if I moved here.

Appreciate any advice!

I’ve tried dating people from apps, school, work, mutual interest groups(?), basically all the suggestions I’ve ever gotten but nothing ever works out. I’ve been on two first dates and one second date. Never had a girlfriend, and since I’m graduating college soon I feel like I’m going to be losing out on a really great place to meet people (not that I’ve had any success doing it). 

Most of the time I’ve tried asking girls out they either ignore me, come up with an excuse and don’t try to figure out another time, or otherwise try to let me down easy. The couple dates I’ve been on have felt great in the moment, especially the most recent two. 

I met a girl on a dating app and we went to a museum and got coffee together. I brought her a little flower which she seemed to really appreciate. We’re both students and we live in different cities, and she drove a decent amount to see me since I didn’t have a car, which I felt bad about but secretly felt like it was a good sign. A couple weeks later, we planned a second date. We called and texted every day in between and things seemed to be going really well. She drove even farther this time even though I had a car at this point and the date was everything I could’ve hoped for. I planned a picnic in a park and we got food, then walked to get ice cream. We spent hours together. I made her a bouquet with flowers she had mentioned liking, and the more we talked the more I felt like it was going to be perfect. We agreed on almost everything and had a conversation about what we want out of a relationship, which we aligned on almost to a T. But the next morning she texted me and said that she didn’t think it was going to work out because we “wanted different things.” I asked for clarification and all she said was that I didn’t do anything wrong but didn’t elaborate further. This obviously crushed me but at this point it’s kind of what I’ve come to expect. 

I guess to wrap it all up, how do I start feeling better about myself and actually find someone who likes me for who I am? I feel like I’ve tried everything and I’m just so discouraged.

Adrian leaned back in his chair while his amber eyes remained 

fixed on Noelle as she absentmindedly drizzled syrup over her 

pancake. 

“Stop staring and eat,” Noelle said with a laugh as she caught his 

gaze. 

Adrian smirked and rested his chin on his hand. “Can’t help it. 

You’re prettier than breakfast.” Noelle rolled her eyes, but a 

faint blush dusted her cheeks. “Flattery will not get you another 

pancake.” 

Before Adrian could respond, his phone vibrated on the table 

and the screen lit up with Miles‘ name. Adrian let out a groan 

while his smile faded as he picked up the phone. 

“Do you have to ruin my morning already, Miles?” Adrian 

grumbled, holding the phone to his ear. 

“Good morning to you too, sunshine,” Miles replied, his voice 

brisk. “I need you at AMN, now.” 

Adrian’s brows furrowed. “I just got home last night. Can’t it 

wait? I’m having breakfast with Noelle.” 

Chapter 1 

“It can’t wait,” Miles said firmly. “We just got an offer from Dela 

Vega Productions. It’s huge, Adrian! The kind of deal people 

would kill for. You need to hear this in person.” 

Adrian pinched the bridge of his nose. He glanced at Noelle who 

was quietly sipping her coffee but watching him with an 

understanding smile. 

“I’m not interested, Miles,” Adrian said while leaning back in his 

chair. “I told you **I** want to spend time with Noelle. Whatever it 

is, we can talk about it tomorrow.” 

“No, we can’t,” Miles insisted with an unyielding tone in his 

voice. “This is a once–in–a–lifetime opportunity. Dela Vega 

Productions doesn’t just knock on doors! They only call when 

they know you’re the best fit. You’d be crazy to ignore this.” 

Adrian sighed heavily and ran a hand through his messy hair. 

He looked at Noelle again, silently apologizing with his eyes. But 

Noelle only smiled softly while nodding her head in silent 

encouragement. 

“Fine,” Adrian finally said but still a little reluctant. “I’ll be there 

in an hour.” 

“Make it half,” Miles quipped before hanging up. 

Adrian set his phone down with a groan, rubbing his face with 

Chapter 1 

both hands. “That man doesn’t understand the concept of 

personal time.” 

Noelle chuckled, reaching across the table to squeeze his hand. 

“It’s okay. I know how important your work is. Go on and 

prepare.” 

Adrian sighed, standing up and walked around the table to 

plant a kiss on the top of her head.” 

At least let me drive you to the bridal shop you mentioned to me 

last night,” Adrian said, his voice soft as he stroked her hair. 

“You said you wanted to pick out your dress.” 

Noelle’s lips curled into a smile as she looked up at him. “You 

don’t have to. You’re already in a rush because of Miles, and I 

know how much he’ll nag you if you’re late.“” 

Adrian smirked, crouching down beside her chair so their eyes 

met. “I can handle Miles. But you? You’re my priority” 

Her heart softened at his words, but she still shook her head 

gently. “I’ll be fine. Grace is meeting me there, remember? You 

focus on this big project. We’ll have plenty of time later to argue 

over lace and tulle.” 

Adrian’s amber eyes narrowed in playful protest. “You’re really 

going to pick a dress without me? That’s cruel, darling.” 

Chapter 1 

She chuckled, brushing her fingers along his cheek. “You’re not supposed to see the dress before the wedding anyway, Mr. 

Blackwood. Isn’t that bad luck?” 

“Superstition,” Adrian countered with a grin, but he sighed in surrender. “Fine. But I’m holding you to a full recap when I get 

back.” 

“Deal,” she said with a laugh, leaning in to press a soft kiss to his lips. “Now go before Miles calls again and yells at you.” 

Reluctantly, Adrian stood, grabbing his jacket and keys. He 

turned back to her as he reached the door. “Text me as soon as 

you’re done, okay? And don’t let Grace pressure you into 

picking something you don’t like.” 

Noelle shook her head, amused by his concern. “I promise. Go on 

now.”” 

With one last lingering glance, Adrian left as the sound of the 

door clicking shut echoed through the house. Noelle exhaled deeply while her fingers brushed against her lips where his kiss. 

lingered, before finishing her coffee. 

Grace stood outside of the bridal shop while keeping her eyes on 

her watch. The soft clinking of her bracelets echoed faintly as 

Chapter 1 

she crossed her arms and tapped her heel against the pavement. 

And when she spotted Noelle approaching in her usual shirt 

and fitted pants, Grace couldn’t help but let out a light laughter. 

“You know, you’re probably the only bride–to–be in the city who 

shows up to pick a wedding dress looking like she’s here to run 

errands.” 

Noelle shrugged with a shy smile as she reached Grace. “What’s 

wrong with being comfortable? I didn’t know I needed to dress 

up to try on dresses.”” 

Grace shook her head, still smiling as she linked her arm with 

Noelle’s. “There’s nothing wrong with it, Elle. I just… admire how 

grounded you are. Most women would be showing off if they 

were in your shoes.” She gestured down to Noelle’s modest 

sneakers. “I heard Adrian spoilt you with everything.”” 

Noelle rolled her eyes as her smile softened. “Don’t remind me. 

I’ve told him a hundred times to stop buying me things I don’t 

need. Half the time, I feel like I have to scold him like a child.” 

Grace let out a laugh. “Oh, I can picture that. But you know him, 

he’s not just an actor. He’s practically a one–man empire. I swear, 

Adrian thinks spoiling **you** is his personal mission.” 

Noelle’s steps faltered slightly and glanced at Grace. “Empire? 

What are you talking about?” 

Chapter 1 

Grace froze for a split second as she realized her slip. But she 

quickly plastered on a nonchalant expression. “I just mean… you know, he’s a big deal. His projects, his influence… it’s a lot to 

handle.” 

Noelle frowned, clearly unconvinced but unwilling to press 

further. “Well, I still wish he’d tone it down. I don’t need all of 

that to be happy. Just him.” 

Grace’s smile softened at her friend’s words. Noelle’s humility 

and sincerity were exactly why she and Adrian adored her so 

much. Looping their arms together again, Grace tugged her 

toward the bridal shop. “Come on, let’s find you the dress of 

your dreams before you talk yourself out of it.” 

But the moment they entered, Noelle ended up gasping in utter 

surprise. She then laughed nervously as her eyes darted around 

the bridal shop. The gleaming chandeliers, racks of delicate lace, 

and mannequins adorned in the finest silk gowns exuded 

luxury at every corner. Her gaze landed on a dress with 

intricate beading, and her jaw dropped when she spotted the 

price tag. 

“Wow… these are beautiful… and expensive!” she exclaimed, her 

tone rising in mild panic. “Why would you bring me here?!” 

Grace burst out laughing, shaking her head as she grabbed 

Chapter 1 

Noelle’s arm to steady her. “Shush, woman! You’re acting like 

you’ve never stepped into a fancy shop before.” 

“That’s because I haven’t!” Noelle whispered sharply, still 

scanning the extravagant displays as if they might swallow her 

whole. “I can’t afford anything here! Grace, I’m just a flower 

shop owner. What were you thinking?” 

Grace rolled her eyes dramatically, pulling Noelle toward a 

nearby rack of gowns. “Oh, please. Did you really think Adrian 

was going to let you spend a single cent of your own money on 

your wedding?” 

Noelle froze, blinking at her. “But… it’s my wedding. I’m 

supposed to-” 

“-Supposed to what?” Grace cut her off with a pointed look. 

“Listen, Elle, Adrian loves you more than anything. If he had his 

way, he’d probably buy you the entire shop just to see you 

smile. You’re his world, so let him spoil you a little.” 

Noelle sighed, running a hand through her hair as her gaze 

shifted back to the dresses. **“**I just… I don’t want to feel like I’m 

taking advantage of him, you know? He already does so much. 

It feels… overwhelming.” 

Grace softened, resting a hand on Noelle’s shoulder. “That’s 

what makes you so special, Elle. You don’t care about my 

Chapter 1 

cousin’s fame or money, and he knows that. But don’t forget. He 

does all of this because it makes him happy, not because he 

thinks you need it. You’re not taking advantage of him, you’re 

giving him the chance to show how much he loves you.” 

Noelle’s lips quirked into a small, hesitant smile. “You make it 

sound so easy.“” 

“That’s because it is,” Grace teased, nudging her gently. “Now, 

come on. Let’s find something that’ll knock Adrian’s socks off on 

your wedding day”

Building a circle that elevates your journey

Why Your Inner Circle Matters More Than You Think 🎯
Have you ever noticed how some people seem to effortlessly navigate life's challenges while radiating positivity? The secret isn't luck—it's the company they keep. The individuals you choose to surround yourself with don't just influence your mood for the day; they shape your entire trajectory in life.

Think about it: when you spend time with someone who complains constantly, you find yourself focusing on problems. Conversely, when you're around someone who sees opportunities everywhere, you start noticing them too. This isn't coincidence—it's psychology in action.

Your social environment acts like an invisible force field, either propelling you forward or holding you back. The conversations you have, the attitudes you absorb, and the energy you exchange all contribute to who you become. This is why being intentional about your relationships isn't selfish—it's essential.

The Five Game-Changing Personality Types 🚀
1. The Visionaries: People Who See What Others Miss 👁️
These are the individuals who look at a blank wall and see a mural. They're the ones who watch a sunset and feel compelled to write poetry, or who see a problem and immediately start brainstorming solutions. Visionaries don't just dream—they make others believe that dreams are achievable.

What makes them special:

They ask ""what if"" instead of ""why not""
They see potential where others see obstacles
They encourage creative thinking and innovation
They help you expand your perspective beyond current limitations
How they'll change your life:
When you're around visionaries, your own imagination gets activated. You start thinking bigger about your goals, your career, your relationships, and your impact on the world. They don't just support your dreams—they help you discover dreams you didn't know you had.

Real-world application:
Seek out that coworker who always has fresh ideas for improving processes. Befriend the neighbor who turned their backyard into an urban garden. Connect with the person at your gym who's training for their first marathon at age 50. These people will stretch your definition of what's possible.

2. The Fire-Starters: Those Who Live With Burning Enthusiasm 🔥
Passionate people are magnetic. They talk about their interests with such genuine excitement that you can't help but get caught up in their energy. Whether they're passionate about cooking, technology, social causes, or their family, they bring an intensity to life that's contagious.

What makes them irresistible:

They fully commit to what matters to them
They speak with conviction and authenticity
They're willing to take risks for what they believe in
They demonstrate that caring deeply is strength, not vulnerability
The transformation they bring:
Passionate people remind you that life is meant to be lived fully, not just endured. They show you that it's okay to care deeply about things, to get excited, to invest emotionally in your pursuits. They help you identify what truly matters to you and give you permission to pursue it wholeheartedly.

Daily implementation:
Notice who lights up when they talk about their work, hobbies, or values. These are your people. Join communities centered around activities you enjoy. Attend local meetups, workshops, or classes. Passionate people naturally gravitate toward spaces where they can share their enthusiasm.

3. The Momentum Builders: Self-Directed and Unstoppable 💪
These individuals don't wait for perfect conditions or external validation to take action. They set goals and systematically work toward them. They face setbacks but don't let them derail their progress. They're the embodiment of the principle that consistent small actions create extraordinary results.

Their defining characteristics:

They take ownership of their circumstances
They focus on solutions rather than problems
They maintain consistent habits that support their goals
They view failures as learning opportunities, not stopping points
The ripple effect they create:
Being around self-directed people naturally raises your standards for yourself. You start questioning why you're waiting for permission, perfect timing, or ideal circumstances. You begin to see that progress is possible right now, with whatever resources you currently have.

Practical steps to find them:
Look for people who are actively working on personal projects, learning new skills, or making positive changes in their lives. They might be the person who wakes up early to exercise, the colleague who's taking evening classes, or the friend who started a side business. These people prove that transformation is always possible.

4. The Appreciation Ambassadors: Masters of Gratitude 🙏
In a world that often focuses on what's missing, wrong, or insufficient, people who naturally notice and appreciate the good stand out like beacons. They're not naive optimists who ignore problems—they simply choose to acknowledge beauty, kindness, and progress wherever they find it.

What sets them apart:

They notice and acknowledge positive moments and gestures
They express genuine appreciation for people and experiences
They find value in simple pleasures and everyday miracles
They help others see their own worth and contributions
The shift they create:
Grateful people literally rewire your brain for positivity. When you spend time with them, you start noticing things you previously overlooked: the way morning light hits your coffee cup, a stranger's smile, the satisfaction of completing a task, the comfort of a friend's laugh. Life becomes richer and more meaningful.

How to connect with them:
These individuals often volunteer at local organizations, write thank-you notes, celebrate others' achievements, or maintain practices like journaling or meditation. They're the people who remember your birthday, compliment your efforts, and make you feel valued. Seek them out in community service groups, spiritual communities (regardless of specific beliefs), or anywhere people gather to celebrate life.

5. The Growth Enthusiasts: Forever Students of Life 📚
Open-minded people are intellectual adventurers. They're curious about different perspectives, willing to change their minds when presented with new information, and excited by the prospect of learning something that challenges their current understanding. They see every interaction as an opportunity to expand their worldview.

Their remarkable qualities:

They ask thoughtful questions and listen genuinely to answers
They admit when they don't know something or when they're wrong
They're interested in cultures, ideas, and experiences different from their own
They encourage exploration and experimentation
The expansion they facilitate:
Open-minded people create safe spaces for growth and self-discovery. Around them, you feel free to explore new ideas, admit uncertainties, and evolve your thinking. They help you realize that changing your mind isn't weakness—it's intelligence in action.

Where to encounter them:
Look for people who read diverse books, travel when possible, engage in thoughtful conversations about complex topics, or show genuine interest in learning about others' experiences. They're often found in book clubs, cultural events, community discussions, online forums focused on learning, and anywhere ideas are exchanged.

The Magnetic Effect: How These People Find Each Other 🧲
Here's something fascinating: people with these positive qualities tend to attract each other. Visionaries appreciate passionate people's commitment. Passionate people admire the consistency of self-directed individuals. Self-directed people value the perspective of grateful people. Grateful people are drawn to the curiosity of open-minded individuals. And open-minded people are inspired by visionaries' creativity.

This creates a beautiful ecosystem where positive qualities amplify each other. When you embody these characteristics yourself, you naturally attract others who share them.

Practical Strategies for Building Your Ideal Circle 🎯
Start with Self-Reflection
Before seeking these people, honestly assess your current relationships. Who in your life already embodies these qualities? How can you spend more time with them? Which relationships consistently drain your energy or reinforce negative patterns?

Be Intentional About New Connections
Instead of leaving relationships to chance, actively seek environments where positive people congregate. This might include professional development workshops, hobby groups, volunteer organizations, fitness classes, book clubs, or creative communities.

Quality Over Quantity
It's better to have three deep, positive relationships than thirty superficial ones. Focus on building meaningful connections with people who genuinely embody these qualities rather than trying to network with everyone.

Become What You Seek
The most effective way to attract positive people is to develop these qualities yourself. Start expressing more gratitude, pursue your passions more actively, stay curious about new ideas, work consistently toward your goals, and dare to envision bigger possibilities.

Practice Patience
Building a supportive circle takes time. Don't abandon current relationships abruptly or expect instant transformation. Instead, gradually increase time with positive influences while maintaining appropriate boundaries with energy-draining relationships.

The Science Behind Social Influence 🧠
Research consistently shows that we unconsciously mirror the emotions, behaviors, and attitudes of people we spend time with. This phenomenon, called emotional contagion, means that surrounding yourself with positive people literally changes your brain chemistry and behavioral patterns.

Studies have found that happiness spreads through social networks up to three degrees of separation. If your friend's friend's friend is happy, it increases your likelihood of happiness. Conversely, negative emotions and limiting beliefs spread in the same way.

This isn't mystical thinking—it's neuroscience. Your brain forms neural pathways based on repeated thoughts and experiences. When you consistently encounter positive attitudes and behaviors, these become your mental defaults.

Overcoming Common Obstacles 🚧
""I Don't Have Time for New Relationships""
Start small. Engage more meaningfully with positive people already in your life. Join one group or activity that aligns with your interests. Quality connections can develop from just a few hours per month of shared activity.

""I'm Too Introverted""
You don't need to become a social butterfly. Look for smaller groups or one-on-one opportunities. Online communities can be perfect starting points for introverts. Focus on depth rather than breadth.

""I Live in a Small Community""
Use technology to your advantage. Online courses, forums, and virtual communities can connect you with like-minded people globally. Consider starting a local group around your interests—you might be surprised who emerges from the woodwork.

""I'm Afraid of Rejection""
Remember that authentic, positive people are generally welcoming to others who share their values and interests. Focus on shared activities rather than trying to force friendships. Let relationships develop naturally through common experiences.

Creating Ripple Effects: Becoming a Positive Influence 🌊
As you surround yourself with these five types of people, you'll naturally begin embodying their qualities. You'll become more visionary, passionate, self-directed, grateful, and open-minded. This transformation will make you a positive influence in others' lives, creating ripple effects that extend far beyond your immediate circle.

Consider how your personal growth impacts your family, coworkers, community, and even strangers you encounter. By intentionally cultivating positive relationships, you're not just improving your own life—you're contributing to a more positive world.

Long-term Vision: Building Legacy Relationships 🏗️
Think beyond immediate benefits. The relationships you build today will shape not just your present, but your future opportunities, personal development, and life satisfaction. These connections often become the foundation for business partnerships, creative collaborations, lifelong friendships, and meaningful contributions to your community.

Some of the most successful and fulfilled people attribute their achievements not to individual effort, but to the network of positive relationships they've cultivated over time. They understand that success is rarely a solo journey.

Your Action Plan: Starting Today 📅
Week 1-2: Identify and spend more time with positive people already in your life.

Week 3-4: Research and join one group or activity aligned with your interests.

Month 2: Initiate deeper conversations with new acquaintances who demonstrate positive qualities.

Month 3: Evaluate your progress and adjust your approach based on what you've learned.

Ongoing: Continuously develop these five qualities within yourself while remaining open to new positive connections.

The Compound Effect of Positive Relationships 📈
Like compound interest in finance, the benefits of positive relationships grow exponentially over time. Each inspiring conversation, each moment of shared passion, each example of perseverance, each expression of gratitude, and each exchange of ideas builds upon previous experiences.

Years from now, you'll look back and realize that the decision to intentionally surround yourself with positive people was one of the most important choices you ever made. Not just for what you achieved, but for who you became in the process.

Your life is too short and too precious to spend it surrounded by people who diminish your light. You deserve relationships that inspire, encourage, challenge, appreciate, and expand you. The five types of people described here aren't just nice to have around—they're essential for creating a life of meaning, growth, and fulfillment.

Start today. Your future self will thank you for the courage to choose your circle intentionally, and the world will benefit from the positive person you become through these transformative relationships.

2 dashes Angostura Bitters
1 Barspoon Giffard Banana Du Bresil

I used 1 part peanut oil to 20 parts bourbon. Shook it vigorously for 45 seconds. Let it rest for  4 hours, occasionally shaking it when the oil rose to the top. Then, placed it in the freezer for two hours to separate the oil. Skimmed some of the solidified oil. After that, ran it through a coffee filter.

Got any tips?,"Howdy Y'all. I definitely could use some advice. This is definitely a long post, so bring a cup of coffee. I graduated college with a bachelor’s in CS back in December 2021, followed by 5 months of job applications and rejection letters. As months went by, the feeling of imposter syndrome was hovering over me, especially after several failed coding tests after I did get a response from one of every 20 jobs I applied to. It was then I decided on an unconventional route and tried to do a startup with my mother in an art-business direction.

I did that for around 2 years, working on WordPress and WooCommerce websites, market research and other things like video and photo editing. We amassed an audience of over 20k subscribers and got a positive response on a digital eBook where we got over $1k in sales in a month out of the blue. People loved her, and I was ecstatic about this market response! That is when we decided to start planning for online courses about the topic and start teaching people about how to do the artwork she makes vs selling her artwork. The keyword in that sentence though was started planning. We never got a chance to follow through as the worst-case scenario happened. After a bad trip to the ER one night, she was diagnosed with a rare, high-grade stage-4 cancer with little warning signs to its presence.

Because I was starting a business with my mother, we decided to stop and shut down the business almost over night, and I would dedicate the next year of my life as her 24/7 personal caregiver. I did everything from running chemotherapy appointments, adapting to her dietary restrictions, and eventually bed-side assistance. Every step of the way I was by her side. This was by far the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. It is almost blurry looking back during this time, and it hasn’t even been that long ago. I am honored that I was able to do everything I did for her, she was a mom that everyone deserved, but not everyone had. (Rest in Peace)

It has been about a year since she has passed away, during that time I have been taking care of things that she left behind. It was quite heart wrenching to both loose my mother, and a startup I poured my heart and soul into in one fell swoop. Afterwards I spent a year cleaning up and selling her home and taking care of probate and other fun legal stuff.

During that time (when she was still alive) I decided on starting an astrophotography hobby and I am still enamored with it to this day. I even went as far as starting my own small website and want to explore it further and start selling prints online. I have always been a space-nerd at heart, but this hobby has taught me that this would be something I would love to be apart of. Realistically this will not pay the bills though, maybe eventually and I will keep trying in the background, but I need to set my priorities straight.

And now we come back around, thank you for listening to my tale. So here I am, I haven’t worked a proper job yet at 26 years old, but I feel like I have been determined the whole time to get into something. I enjoyed web development, working on marketing and business startups, but I would love to get into something space oriented while keeping to my core CS grad knowledge (if a bit rusty). What would you do in my situation? What career tips would you recommend to get into web development? Or would you pivot to a different route that you see would fit my direction?

We really had a great time, but suddenly I feel she is avoiding me.","So I met a girl (let us call her S) amongst others from my class at the orientation. After the orientation we decided to walk back to the residence apartment instead of taking a bus. Initially it was me, and 3 other girls walking back. We were having a casual conversation. Without realising me and S were walking ahead and the other two girls were walking behind us. The other two girls decided to take the bus midway. Me and S decided to walk for another 40 min back to the apartments. We opened up and told our stories-our childhood, about our families, about our education, life and how we ended up here. 
I'm an extrovert and I kinda have a lose mouth and S figured that out. I don't know what she saw in me but she decided to tell me her deep secret (which even her roommates don't know). I don't know why she trusted me. I've told her I will keep it a secret and guard it with life.
Later she was also telling me about the resources in the college and how I should be using it judicially. She really did her homework before coming here and was kind enough to give me advices on how to proceed. 
She even asked me to find a place in the town for a cup of coffee🥹🥹
We really had a good talk and after reaching our apartments, we decided to take a break, have a snack and meet after 15 minutes.
I texted her after 15 minutes but S told me she's tired so we called the plan off.
The very next day we had another orientation in college. I saw her there with her friends, we exchanged Greetings and she told that she'll talk to me later. I told her let us catch up after the orientation and she said okay. After orientation she was going ahead with her friends i followed her to a coffee shop. I was right behind her but she ignored me and went with her friends. (- Aura😭)
I texted her later the evening that can we meet for a walk but she told she's busy. That reply felt as if she's ignoring me. Idk what to do now. 🫠

I am blessed with good finances for now and I noted that my spending has up-ticked a lot in last few years as my savings, income have increased. I also got a little bit fat (went from 148 lbs to 160 lbs) from eating out a lot. I am in phase of moving out of psychology of spending on eating out and earning reward points to cover my flights in future. I am ashamed that I have fallen for consumerism. 



I started using a debit card last month, I was initially just purchasing things that I actually needed and then I realized that I was doing the same thing that I did with credit cards. My spending was low initial few weeks of using debit card and now it is back to where it was before. So I need a budget and I also want it to be flexible for some additional expenses when I go out with friends and family, I don't want to appear super stingy. 



So, this is my plan for now. I want to keep my spending under 3500$ a month(this includes 2K rent, gym and utilities). I will buy groceries without any restrictions (as a vegan person, this is never a big expense), go out with girlfriend couple of times a month and eat out (no other dining out, not even occasional coffee). Clothing and electronics for 150$ a month. (I honestly don't think I need anymore electronics right now) Have one small trip every month with my gf for 750 to 1000$, depending on how much I am saving from this personal budget of 3.5K$.

Hey, I’m Reza. I’ve always felt a bit out of place in surface-level conversations. I’m not really looking for a “vibe” or a party crew  I’m looking for real connection. The kind that goes beyond small talk. The kind that makes you feel seen, not just heard.

I’ve been through a lot, like many of us heartbreak, reinvention, and long nights staring at the ceiling asking what the point of it all is. But I’ve also found meaning in helping others, healing old wounds, and building things that matter  whether that’s a business, a friendship, or a life with integrity.

What I’d love to find now is a circle of people  or even just one or two  who also think deeply, feel fully, and want to grow. People who care about emotional honesty, self-awareness, creativity, and inner peace. People who want to talk about life like it actually matters.

I’m in Brisbane, and I’d love to eventually meet up  grab a coffee, share a story, go for a walk and talk about how weird and beautiful the world is. But I’m also open to deep friendships online. Maybe you’re also trying to find your people. Maybe you’ve been holding a lot inside too.

*Why successful people always zoom out before diving in*

## The Hidden Pattern Behind Every Success Story 📈

Ever wondered why some people seem to effortlessly solve complex problems while others get stuck spinning their wheels? The secret isn't superior intelligence or luck—it's perspective.

When faced with any challenge, whether it's a stubborn relationship conflict, a career roadblock, or even something as mundane as chronic lateness, most people dive straight into fixing symptoms. But there's a more powerful approach that changes everything: **connecting every problem to its larger system**.

This isn't about mystical thinking or philosophical theories. It's about developing a practical skill that will serve you whether you're troubleshooting a technical issue, improving your health, or building better relationships.

## Why Your Current Problem-Solving Approach Might Be Sabotaging You 🚫

Picture this: Your car keeps breaking down. The obvious response? Take it to the mechanic, fix the immediate issue, and drive away. But three weeks later, you're back with another problem. Then another.

Most people get trapped in this reactive cycle because they're focused on isolated incidents rather than patterns. They're treating symptoms instead of understanding the system that creates those symptoms.

The same principle applies to every area of life:

**Career frustrations** often stem from misaligned values or industry trends, not just difficult bosses.

**Relationship conflicts** usually reflect communication patterns and unmet needs, not isolated arguments.

**Financial stress** typically emerges from spending habits and income structures, not individual purchases.

**Health problems** frequently connect to lifestyle systems, not random bad luck.

When you train yourself to see these connections, you stop playing whack-a-mole with problems and start addressing root causes.

## The Systems Thinking Toolkit: Your Daily Game-Changer 🛠️

### 1. The Ripple Effect Analysis

Every problem exists within a web of interconnected factors. Before jumping to solutions, map out the ripples.

**Practical Exercise:** When facing any challenge, ask yourself:
- What factors contribute to this situation?
- Who else is affected by this problem?
- What other areas of my life does this connect to?
- If I solve this in isolation, what might I miss?

**Real-World Example:** If you're always stressed about deadlines, don't just work longer hours. Examine your planning systems, communication patterns with colleagues, energy management throughout the day, and even your workspace setup. Often, the solution lies in optimizing one of these connected areas rather than just working harder.

### 2. The Three-Level Perspective Framework

Train yourself to view every situation through three lenses:

**Micro Level:** The immediate problem and its direct factors
**Macro Level:** The broader environment and trends influencing the situation  
**Meta Level:** The underlying patterns and principles at work

**Daily Application:** When your teenager won't do homework, don't just focus on that specific resistance (micro). Consider their school environment, peer influences, and current educational pressures (macro), plus their relationship with authority, learning style, and developmental stage (meta).

### 3. The Ecosystem Mapping Method 🗺️

Every problem exists within an ecosystem of relationships, resources, constraints, and opportunities.

**How to Apply This:**
- List all the people involved or affected
- Identify available resources and existing limitations
- Note timing factors and external pressures
- Map out potential allies and obstacles

**Example in Action:** If you're struggling with work-life balance, your ecosystem includes your family members, colleagues, industry expectations, personal energy patterns, commute logistics, childcare arrangements, and even your neighborhood's community resources. Solutions often emerge from optimizing these interconnected elements rather than just managing your calendar better.

## Breaking Free from Tunnel Vision: The Power of Pattern Recognition 🔍

### Spotting the Invisible Connections

Most people miss the connections between their problems because they're looking for obvious, direct links. But the most powerful insights often come from unexpected relationships.

**Pattern Recognition Exercise:**
Keep a simple daily log for one week. Note challenges, frustrations, and setbacks. After seven days, look for patterns:
- Do problems cluster around certain times, people, or situations?
- Which challenges share common underlying factors?
- Where do you see repeated themes or triggers?

### The Context Revolution

Context shapes everything, yet most people ignore it when problem-solving. The same approach that works brilliantly in one context might fail miserably in another.

**Context Questions to Ask:**
- What's unique about the current environment or timing?
- How do cultural, social, or organizational factors influence this situation?
- What worked in similar situations, and why might those solutions not apply here?

## The Compound Effect of Systems Solutions ⚡

When you address problems at the systems level, your solutions tend to:

**Prevent Related Issues:** Fix one well-connected problem, and you often prevent several others.

**Create Positive Cascades:** Systems-level improvements generate beneficial ripple effects across multiple areas.

**Build Long-term Resilience:** Instead of constant firefighting, you develop robust systems that handle future challenges better.

**Save Time and Energy:** You solve multiple problems with single, well-designed interventions.

## Practical Implementation: Your 30-Day Systems Thinking Challenge 📅

### Week 1: Awareness Building
Start noticing connections everywhere. When any problem arises, spend five minutes identifying at least three factors that contribute to or are affected by this issue.

### Week 2: Pattern Documentation
Keep a simple log of challenges and their broader contexts. Look for recurring themes, timing patterns, and environmental factors.

### Week 3: Ecosystem Mapping
For one significant ongoing challenge, create a comprehensive map of all connected factors, people, and potential solutions.

### Week 4: Systems Solutions
Instead of quick fixes, design solutions that address multiple connected factors simultaneously.

## Beyond Problem-Solving: Systems Thinking as Life Strategy 🎲

### Decision-Making Excellence

When facing any major decision, systems thinkers evaluate:
- How this choice affects multiple life areas
- What precedent this decision sets for future choices
- How this aligns with broader values and long-term goals
- What unintended consequences might emerge

### Relationship Mastery

Understanding relationships as systems transforms how you handle conflicts, build connections, and create mutual value. Every interaction exists within a broader context of shared history, external pressures, and future implications.

### Career Navigation

Career success isn't just about individual performance—it's about understanding industry ecosystems, organizational dynamics, market trends, and how your role connects to broader value creation.

## The Compound Benefits: Why This Matters for Your Future 🚀

Developing systems thinking doesn't just solve today's problems—it builds your capacity to handle increasingly complex challenges. As our world becomes more interconnected, this skill becomes more valuable.

**Professional Advantages:**
- Enhanced strategic thinking capabilities
- Better ability to manage complex projects
- Improved collaboration and communication skills
- Greater resilience when facing unexpected changes

**Personal Benefits:**
- More effective relationship management
- Better health and wellness outcomes
- Improved financial decision-making
- Reduced stress from constantly fighting symptoms

**Community Impact:**
- More thoughtful parenting approaches
- Better neighborhood and community involvement
- Enhanced ability to contribute to positive social change

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid ⚠️

### Analysis Paralysis
Systems thinking doesn't mean endless analysis. Set boundaries on exploration time and move to action within reasonable timeframes.

### Overwhelming Complexity
Start with simple connections and gradually build your ability to see more complex patterns. Don't try to map every possible connection immediately.

### Ignoring Individual Agency
While systems matter, individual choices and actions still drive outcomes. Balance systems awareness with personal responsibility.

## Making It Stick: Building Your Systems Thinking Muscle 💪

### Daily Micro-Practices
- When reading news, ask: ""What broader trends does this represent?""
- During conversations, notice how topics connect to larger themes
- When planning activities, consider their ripple effects on other life areas

### Weekly Reviews
Spend 15 minutes each week identifying patterns in your challenges and successes. Look for systems-level insights that could improve the coming week.

### Monthly Deep-Dives
Once monthly, choose one ongoing challenge and do a comprehensive systems analysis. Map connections, identify leverage points, and design multi-faceted solutions.

## The Long-Term Vision: Becoming a Systems Thinker 🌟

Systems thinking isn't just a problem-solving tool—it's a way of seeing the world that enhances every aspect of life. As you develop this capacity, you'll find yourself:

- Making better decisions with less stress
- Solving problems more efficiently and effectively
- Building stronger, more resilient relationships
- Creating positive changes that compound over time
- Developing wisdom that serves you in any situation

The journey from reactive problem-solving to systems thinking transforms not just how you handle challenges, but how you understand your role in the larger web of life. You become someone who doesn't just react to circumstances, but actively shapes better outcomes through thoughtful engagement with the systems around you.

Remember: every expert was once a beginner. Start small, stay consistent, and trust the process. Your future self will thank you for developing this transformative way of thinking.

---

**Your Next Action:** Choose one current challenge in your life and spend 10 minutes mapping its connections to broader patterns and systems. You might be surprised by what you discover.

1n20clz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1n20clz/cmv_people_who_post_their_morning_routines_or/,CMV: People who post their morning routines or daily habits on Instagram/TikTok are mostly doing it for validation,"Lately I’ve been noticing how popular “day in the life” or “morning routine” style videos are on Instagram and TikTok. People (mostly Gen Z and Millennials) record themselves making coffee, journaling, hitting the gym, showing what they eat, or going through their skincare steps. These videos rack up tons of views and comments, and the creators often do them consistently almost like a mini-series.

My take is that I think a lot of this is less about “sharing” or “inspiring” and more about seeking validation. Social media is built on feedback loops (likes, shares, comments), and these routine-style posts seem like a way to say, ""Look how productive, disciplined, or aesthetic my life is - do you admire it?”

To me, if your morning routine or daily flow is just for you, then you’d quietly live it out. Filming, editing, and posting it for strangers feels like it crosses into performance. I get that some people might genuinely want to motivate others or share tips, but I think the main driver for most of these posts is external approval.

That said, I could be wrong. Maybe there are other perspectives I’m missing:

* Do you think some people share routines as a form of accountability (like putting it out there keeps them consistent)?
* Could it be more about community and relatability than validation?
* Or maybe it really does help inspire others in a meaningful way, even if validation plays a role.

Am I being too cynical by assuming most of this content is about validation?",0,1756347646.0,changemyview,7,0.38,False

Life has a funny way of keeping us anchored to moments that have already sailed away. We replay conversations, second-guess decisions, and sometimes find ourselves stuck in a mental time machine that only travels backward. But here's the reality check we all need: the past is like a textbook - valuable for reference, but not meant to be our permanent residence.

## The Mental Prison We Build 🔒

Think about it. How many hours do you spend each week replaying that awkward conversation from last month? Or beating yourself up over a career choice you made five years ago? We've all been there, creating elaborate mental prisons where we're both the warden and the prisoner.

This backward-looking habit doesn't just waste time - it actively sabotages our present. When we're mentally living in yesterday, we miss the opportunities of today. It's like trying to drive while constantly staring in the rearview mirror. You're bound to crash into something good that's right in front of you.

## The Learning vs. Living Distinction 📚

There's a crucial difference between learning from the past and living in it. Learning means extracting the lesson, noting what worked and what didn't, then filing it away as wisdom for future use. Living in the past means replaying events endlessly, often with a soundtrack of regret or what-if scenarios.

**Learning from the past looks like:**
- Recognizing patterns in your behavior
- Understanding which decisions led to positive outcomes
- Identifying red flags you missed before
- Appreciating how far you've come

**Living in the past looks like:**
- Constantly rehashing old arguments
- Refusing to try new approaches because of previous failures
- Defining yourself by past mistakes
- Comparing every new situation to old ones

## Daily Strategies to Stay Present 🎯

### Morning Reality Check ☀️
Start each day by asking yourself: ""What can I do TODAY to move closer to where I want to be?"" This simple question shifts your brain from past-focused to future-oriented thinking.

### The 5-Minute Rule ⏰
When you catch yourself spiraling into past events, set a timer for 5 minutes. Allow yourself to think about it during those 5 minutes, then consciously redirect your attention to something in the present moment.

### Action Over Analysis 💪
Instead of analyzing why something went wrong in the past, spend that energy on taking one small action toward improvement today. Analysis paralysis keeps you stuck; action creates momentum.

### The Lesson Log 📝
Keep a simple note on your phone where you jot down lessons learned from challenging situations. Once you've written it down, consider the learning complete. No need to keep rehashing it mentally.

## The Opportunity Cost of Yesterday 💰

Every minute spent reliving the past is a minute not invested in building your future. Think about the compound interest of that time. If you spend 30 minutes daily dwelling on past mistakes, that's 182.5 hours per year - more than four full work weeks - invested in something that can't be changed.

What could you accomplish with those 182 hours instead? Learn a new skill? Build a side project? Strengthen relationships? Exercise more? The possibilities are endless when you redirect that mental energy forward.

## Breaking the Cycle 🔄

The pattern of living in the past often starts with good intentions. We tell ourselves we're being thoughtful or learning from mistakes. But there's a point where reflection becomes rumination, and rumination becomes a habit that holds us back.

**Practical Steps to Break Free:**

**Catch the Pattern** 👁️
Start noticing when your mind drifts to past events. Don't judge it - just notice it. Awareness is the first step to change.

**Ask Better Questions** 🤔
Instead of ""Why did this happen to me?"" try ""What can I do differently moving forward?"" The first question keeps you stuck; the second opens possibilities.

**Create Future Anchors** ⚓
Set specific, exciting goals that require your present attention. When your mind has something compelling to work toward, it's less likely to get stuck in reverse.

**Practice Present-Moment Activities** 🧘
Engage in activities that demand your full attention: cooking, exercising, having deep conversations, learning new skills. These naturally pull you into the now.

## The Forgiveness Factor 🤝

Often, living in the past is really about struggling to forgive - either ourselves or others. But forgiveness isn't about condoning what happened; it's about freeing yourself from the burden of carrying it forward.

You don't forgive for the other person's sake. You forgive for your own freedom. Every grudge you hold, every regret you carry, is weight that slows you down on your journey forward.

## Building a Forward-Looking Mindset 🌅

Developing a healthy relationship with time means treating the past like a consultant, not a commander. You check in with past experiences when you need guidance, but you don't let them make your current decisions.

**The Past as Consultant:**
""Based on what I learned before, what's the wisest approach here?""

**The Past as Commander:**
""I can't try this because something similar didn't work before.""

See the difference? One empowers you with wisdom; the other imprisons you with fear.

## Your Daily Action Plan 📋

Starting tomorrow, try this simple routine:

**Morning:** Spend 2 minutes identifying one thing you're excited to work on today.

**Midday:** When you catch yourself dwelling on the past, take three deep breaths and name three things you can see, hear, and feel right now.

**Evening:** Before bed, write down one thing you learned today and one thing you're looking forward to tomorrow.

This isn't about toxic positivity or pretending the past doesn't matter. It's about giving the past its proper place - as a teacher, not a prison warden.

## The Ripple Effect 🌊

When you stop living in the past, something interesting happens. The people around you notice. Your energy shifts. Instead of being the person who always brings up old stories or past grievances, you become the person who's focused on solutions and possibilities.

This change doesn't just benefit you - it elevates everyone in your circle. Your forward-looking energy becomes contagious, inspiring others to focus on what they can control and improve.

## The Ultimate Truth 💡

Here's what nobody tells you about the past: it's actually much less fixed than you think. Not the events themselves, but their meaning in your life. You have the power to rewrite the story of what those experiences mean for your future.

That failure from three years ago? It taught you resilience. That relationship that ended badly? It showed you what you really value. That career setback? It redirected you toward something better.

The past is only a prison if you choose to stay locked inside. The key has always been in your hand. The question isn't whether you can leave - it's whether you will.

Your best days aren't behind you. They're ahead of you, waiting to be created by the choices you make starting right now. The past gave you lessons. The present gives you power. Use both wisely. 🌟

1n20b2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1n20b2m/the_school_on_roosevelt_street/,The School on Roosevelt Street,"ONE.
My fascination with ghosts and the paranormal began 2 years ago. It was a cool summer night, and it was beginning to rain. Me and my friends, Dan and Todd, were walking back home from a ‘night on the town’, which isn't saying much as we live in a small town with a population of 1,400 people.

We were walking down Roosevelt street, despite Dan's protest. He hated taking this path home because of the decaying school that sat dormant on this street. Rumor around town was that the school is haunted. People say they have heard screaming and wailing from the school at night, but Todd says it's all bullshit.

It's a large modern brick building standing 2 floors tall and takes up the entire block. It was once a nice up-to-date school, but it closed down a couple years prior due to a dwindling student population. A year later it was bought by an old mechanic in town, and he intended to renovate it into a hotel, but the city said the school was on the verge of being condemned due to the west wing's second floor being on the verge of collapse. So now it sits nearly empty, the mechanic Charlie lives alone in the school and works out of the old auto shop room, so his investment wouldn’t be a complete waste. Charlie denies the claims of the school being haunted.

As we walked closer to the school Dan and Todd were arguing about how ‘haunted’ the school was.

“I just don’t see why we couldn’t take a different route home”  Dan said “this area gives me the heebie jeebies” 

“This is the fastest route home, and I'm not trying to get caught in the rain” Todd replied “It's just a bunch of small town gossip is all, this town has nothing else going on so they make things up to stay interesting” 

“I went here when I was a kid,” I added. “There's nothing scary about it. The closest occurrence we had was me almost dying of boredom a couple times.” 

“Yeah yeah very funny” Dan sighed “My dad says he refuses to step foot on this street after what he heard one night”

“Okay, but your dad is also a drunk, so who knows what he actually heard.” said Todd. 

As Dan and Todd continued bickering about how scary the school was, I heard a faint tapping sound coming from nearby. I stopped dead in my tracks, it sounded like a hand tapping on glass. 

“Guys shut up for a sec” I said “Do you hear that?”  

They slowed to a stop, and I realized the sound was coming from the direction of the school. The tapping sound became louder as if someone was beating on a window. I didn’t see anything at first, but as I looked closer into the school I saw the outline of a girl in one of the lower windows. 

“There! In-in the West Wing! Theres a- there's a girl in the window on the bottom floor!” I stammered as I grabbed my phone from my pocket. 

“Which window?” Todd asked “there's a lot of windows dude” 

“Oh Shit, there! I see her!” Dan yelled

I opened the camera on my phone to try record a video, but before I could I heard a piercing scream and I dropped my phone. 

I bent down and picked my phone up off the ground, when I looked back up she was gone. 

“Where'd she go?!” I asked frantically

“She dropped below the window” Dan responded “I don't see her anymore!” 

I continued looking around but Dan was right, she was gone. 

“Dammit” I exclaimed “I should have got that on video!” 

“I didn’t see anything” Todd stated “are you sure you saw a girl? That screech could have been anything.” 

“Yes dude, I'm sure! That was the scariest moment of my life. Now I'm ready to get the hell out of here, let’s go” Dan said, while picking up the pace back towards home. 

“Wait, shouldn't we find out what the hell that was?” I asked 

“How? Its private property?” Asked Todd “if you want to call the cops and tell them you saw a ghost girl in the school you can go right ahead, but I'm going to join Dan and get out of here, it's starting to rain” As he turned to catch up with Dan.

I cursed under my breath again, upset that I messed up what would have been the best ghost evidence on the internet. I took one more look at the school before turning around to join my friends. 


TWO:
That moment sparked my inspiration to start a youtube channel, so a couple months later Todd, Dan, and I created the Midwest Ghost Hunters. We have been on a dozen ghost hunts by now, with little to no evidence to show for it, but we have amassed 60k subscribers. 

The closest thing we have to evidence is a door closing on its own during our investigation of an abandoned mall. Todd is adamant that it was a draft, but Dan argues it was definitely something paranormal and that Todd is ignorant. Other than that though, all we have caught are some loud creaks and bangs while investigating abandoned houses, which I realize can easily be brushed off as nothing.

I am certain that our big break would be if we could investigate the school. Ever since word of our channel got around town, people have told me many stories regarding that building, and they insist that’s what we should investigate next. I've already tried asking the owner Charlie if I could, he said he would if he could but his insurance doesn’t want anyone else going in that building and that they are already opposed to him living there as is. So for now I have just been recording the neighborhoods stories to hopefully make into a video later. 


THREE:
I woke up this morning to my phone ringing. I rolled over disgruntledly to see Todd calling.

“What do you want?” I answered a bit harshly. 

“Well good morning to you too, Sunshine” Todd responded

“Well excuse me, It is 8am on a Saturday, what is so important that it couldn't have been a text?” I asked 

“Well, I call with good news” Todd said 

“Okay, well, what is it then” I replied curiously

“Charlie died” Todd stated a bit too excitedly 

I paused before asking “How is this good news Todd?” 

“Well it's not, but it's good for us at least. Because this means we can finally investigate the school,” he replied.

I took a moment, thinking it over, unsure what to say. I had only woken up moments ago, and now I'm being told Charlie is dead and that we should investigate his school. 

Todd added “Abby just told me. His body is going to the coroner's office this morning. An officer found his car wrapped around a tree, they suspect it happened last night.” 

Todd's wife Abby works for the city, so of course she has the inside scoop.

“There’s a slight hitch though,” Todd added. 

“What's that?” I asked 

“Well Abby tried to notify the next of kin, but all that he had listed was some guy down south. She told him the news, and he told her that he would be coming up in a couple days and that he is going to buy the school when he gets there.” Todd said. 

“That's odd” I added “he has quite the list of priorities I guess. What would he want with a condemned school anyways?”  

“I was wondering the same thing” Todd said “but regardless that means we would have to investigate it soon, before the buyer gets into town.” 

Todd was right, we could investigate the school now that Charlie is dead. It probably isn’t very considerate but it's a possibility nonetheless, and we wouldn't get another possibility like this again. 

“Okay, I’ll tell Dan,” I said finally “we will investigate the school tonight” 


FOUR:
It was well after dark as we approached the school. It's even more ominous when we are this close, especially when it is bathed in the night. The building looks weathered yet surprisingly current, and besides for the paint flaking and fading away, it looks just as I remember it from when I was a student. We crossed the empty parking lot and as we got to the front doors Todd spoke first. 

“Sooo do we just walk in through the front door, or did anyone make a plan for how we get inside?” He asked 

I looked over to Dan and he gave me a small shrug as a response. 

I responded “I guess I didn't consider that part. I put too much thought into whether or not we should and didn’t think about if we even could.” 

Dan let out a light chuckle saying “I was more worried about if it's more or less illegal to break into a man's house after he is dead. Is it still breaking and entering if he is dead, or is this just trespassing?” 

“I'm no lawyer, and I'm barely a ghost hunter, but from a legal standpoint, i'm gonna say maybe” I joked

“Well he did say he would be okay with it if it weren't for his insurance” Todd replied “who would we sue now if we got hurt?”

“Okay, that's a reasonable point I suppose” I said trying to make myself feel better about this potential crime “but we better figure out a way inside here soon, I don’t want any cops to see us. Anyone have any ideas?” 

Todd bent over and grabbed a large rock. 

“No, put that down dude” Dan said in a hushed shout “That would definitely be breaking and entering” 

“Well, do you have a better idea?” Todd asked

As Todd and Dan squabble about the most acceptable way to break into the school, I approached the front doors. I put my hands on the doors and gave it a little push, and to our surprise they actually opened. 

“He left them unlocked?” Asked Dan

“I guess” I responded “it is a small town after all, maybe he didn't plan to be out for long.” 

Todd and Dan entered the building behind me. The doors closed behind us and we could hear the sound echo throughout the vast building. We turned on our shoulder lights, the school still has power running to it, but we don’t want any neighbors to see the lights on.

The school has an odd aesthetic to it since it is now redesigned to be a home. We stood in the entryway which is a large open hallway now designed as a very open living room. There were a few display cases along the nearest wall that now holds Charlie's shoes and coats. The room has a few couches and an older TV, neither of them seemed to be used in a while. 

“You guys ready?” I asked as I pulled out the camera. 

“Yes, but please don't do your regular intro for our video” Todd pleaded

“Why not? I've done it for every video” I asked

“Dude, it's annoyingly stereotypical. If this video does blow up our channel like you say it will, we can't have that type of introduction for the new viewers” Todd stated

“Okay well do you want to do the introduction then?” I asked him. 

“Well no, that'd be even worse” he said

“Okay then. I’ll do the introduction my way then.” I stated

I turned the camera around to face me and hit record. “Good evening Midwest Ghost Viewers, we are back again with another investigative video! Tonight we are investigating my local school. This building is a bit of a local legend. There are so many terrifying stories about this location, so we just had to investigate it. So get ready to start believing in the paranormal, but before you do, don’t forget to like and subscribe.” 

I hit pause on the camera, and it  was followed by a deafening silence in the room. I could see Todd and Dan holding back laughter. 

“I agree with Todd, that shit sounds pathetic dude” Dan laughed finally

“Yeah I know” I said “It always does.” 

“That one hurt,” Todd chuckled while shaking his head. “Can we go explore now with that out of the way?” 

“Yes please” I said dejectedly 

To the right of the now living room is the gymnasium, and to the left is the swimming pool, we elected to explore the gymnasium first. 

The gymnasium didn’t appear to be altered at all, it also didn’t appear to have been used lately, the bleachers are dusty and the floor looks as if it hadn’t been swept in at least a year. 

I pulled out my camera to record some footage while we performed our tests. Our investigation usually starts with an ouija board, most ghost hunters claim this is complete BS, and honestly we agree, but it does provide some good content. We didn't get much if any movement from the board this time, besides for Todd trying to spell out P-E-N-I-S a couple times. The next test we like to try is the spirit box, Todd absolutely hates this device, and I can see why, but Dan is convinced it is legit. We let the spirit box run for a while. Dan said he heard some related words, but I think he was really stretching his imagination, because all I heard was incoherent nonsense. I usually check an EMF reader while we investigate, but it was very unreliable tonight due to the building actually having power for once. And speaking of power, the air conditioner scared the hell out of us a couple times during the testing. We are used to it being dead silent and we fine tune our ears to pick up any noises, so when the AC roared to life we all jumped.

Once we agreed we weren’t getting any evidence in this area we walked across the hall to the swimming pool. The room is humid and smells like chlorine despite the 12 foot pool being drained. The hot tub had a couple renovations from the last time I had seen it, there is now a TV mounted nearby and a new minifridge sitting adjacent. We ran a few tests in this room as well, with no proof yet again. 

We wandered over to the locker rooms which are just outside of the swimming area. We entered the men's room, and it appeared to be well used. I assume this was Charlie's main bathing area based off of the fresh towels sitting in the lockers and dirty laundry sitting in a hamper in the corner. The sink has a couple of new drawers built on to it, with his toiletries sitting on top. We didn’t stay in here for long or record any video, as it felt invasive even though he was gone. 

I stepped back into the hall and took an awkward glance into the women's locker room. 

“Hey bud, what ya looking at?” Dan asked, ""Is this how I find out you are a pervert?”

“I'm just curious, haven’t you wondered what a women's locker room is like?” I asked 

“Sure, but it’s probably the same as the men's just without the urinals, and maybe different paint” Todd stated

“Okay well don't you guys wanna find out, now is our chance” I said 

“Sure I suppose, why not?  Let's go peep in the girls bathroom” Todd said while walking in. 

When we entered the locker room we were surprised and speechless from what we saw. The women's room also appears to be well used, but by girls, which was concerning because Charlie didn't have a wife nor kids. The lockers contained towels and girls' clothing, ranging from children's size to adult. The doors on the stalls were removed. 

Todd broke the silence by saying “What- the- fuck. Are you guys disturbed by this as well” 

“This is definitely concerning, this doesn't make any sense” I replied

“Why would Charlie have girls' clothes here, and why so much? It’s just him that lives here.” Todd asked 

Before I had a chance to reply Dan shushed us. His eyes wide with fear, and stammered “I think I just heard someone knocking” 

“As in? Knocking how” Todd asked still focused on the locker room

“Like when you knock on somebody's front door politely waiting to be let inside” Dan said 

“Could it have been old pipes maybe?” Todd asked still looking around the locker room

“No, it definitely sounded like a hand knocking on a door. As in knock knock, who's there” Dan said “I'm telling you guys-”

Knock,Knock,Knock

He was interrupted by the knocking, it must have been louder this time as Todd and I both heard it clearly. Dan was right it definitely sounded like someone knocking on a door, even Todd looked like he agreed. 

I turned my camera on and we stepped back into the hall. 

I asked “is it coming from the front door? Did someone find out we are here?” 

“Maybe,” Dan said “it's so hard to tell, the building echoes so much” 

I started cautiously walking to the front door when we heard it again. 

Knock,Knock,Knock

“That sounded like it came from down the hall” Todd stated 

“That leads deeper into the school, that's the hall that brings you to either the West or East wings” I said

“Well I don't like that,” Dan said as the three of us began walking down the hall. 

The hall felt as if it was a mile long, and it felt like I was running one based on how hard my heart was beating. I'm excited that this will be the first bit of actual evidence we have ever gotten, but I am also terrified.

 We finally got to the end of the hall, there are two sets of double doors on either side of the hall. The right set of doors are open, they lead into the East wing which is the high school, assumedly where Charlie used to live. The left doors are chained shut, they lead into the west wing which is the elementary school, that is the condemned wing so that's probably why they are chained shut. 

“Which way do you think it came from” Todd asked

We got our answer as we heard another Knock,Knock,Knock to the left and I saw the west wing doors shake and bind against the chains. 

I slowly approached the doors and asked “Hello, who is it?” with false confidence.

In response we heard a quick pattering fleeing from the door, like little footsteps running away in a game of tag.

We sat in silence for a moment, my confidence quickly fading.  

Dan pushed on the doors and said “we have to get into the west wing, there is clearly something back there. Do you think Charlie left a key somewhere” while he pulled on the lock.

“Maybe” I replied “but actually the East and West wings share a lunch room, so the two sides meet up again at the cafeteria, maybe those doors are less secure and easier to break into.” 

“Well let's take a trip through the east wing then” Todd said “before that critter gets away.”

We all shared a look of agreement, and headed through the high school doors.


FIVE:
The high school side appears to be more taken care of, the carpet looks recently vacuumed and the walls have been repainted. We walk through the vacant halls, passing by empty class rooms. I recorded some more with the camera, while Dan and Todd were bickering yet again.

Dan said “there is no way you actually think that was an animal back there” 

“It had to be” Todd responded “what else could it be? A ghost? A ghoul? Some sort of monster maybe?” 

“We are GHOST hunting, so yes I do think it could be a ghost. That is the whole reason we are out here, that's what we are trying to find” Dan stated

Todd stayed quiet, probably because Dan has a pretty good point.

“What kind of animal do you think it was then?” Dan asked half jokingly 

“I don't know, that's why we are going over there. It has to be something pretty big though.” Todd said unconvincingly

“Oh come on dude, seriously? Do you hear yourself right now” Dan asked

We passed by the auto shop, it lay empty which seems odd to me. The shop hasn’t changed much, besides for the addition of Charlie's tools. The room is fairly dusty, but it's hard to tell if that's out of the ordinary for auto shops. The attached classroom is renovated into an office space. A newer computer sits atop his desk with a few file cabinets sitting along the nearby wall. We searched the office for his keys, but we found nothing, so we kept heading for the cafeteria.  


I led us through the next corridor, and through a shortcut through the library. It has been remodeled into an oversized living room area. A couple couches and a reclining chair sat around a large TV with a nice sound system. A couple of the bookshelves now hold an extensive collection of movies and CDs. We planned to come back to this room and investigate it further after we checked out the west wing. 


We took a quick detour to explore the principals’ office which is now Charlie's bedroom. The layout reminds me of a small apartment, there's a waiting room when you first walk in, which connects to Charlie's bedroom and main bathroom. It is well decorated, the waiting area has a couple plants sitting in the corners of the room and the walls are arranged with posters of old metal bands I don't recognize. His bedroom is also well kept, the bed is made and his nightstand seems organized. We searched this area as well, but did not have any more luck finding the keys. I was beginning to worry that he may have had the keys on him the night he died, but I tried to push that thought away as we continued our expedition to the cafeteria. 


We finally arrived at the cafeteria, it is a spacious room lined with rows of long tables. I looked closer at the tables and saw something that troubled me. There are about a dozen lunch trays loaded with food sitting on a couple of the tables. The food looks to be only a day or two old. I point it out to the guys, and Todd seems equally troubled by it. We were confused about why Charlie would need so many trays for himself, but Dan walked by us clearly more interested in the doors that connect to the West Wing, expressing a bravery we haven’t seen from him before. He stepped up to the doors and gave them a push, they are locked, so he took a couple steps back and before either Todd or I can protest he kicks the doors open. 

We caught up to Dan and I said “Y’know a heads up would have been nice”

Dan replied “Well we couldn't find the keys and I don’t know of any other ways in, so how else were we going to get into the elementary school?”

Todd said “I don't know dude, you didn't really give us any time to weigh our options.” 

“Okay well it's too late now, so why are we wasting time debating how to get through the doors when I've already kicked them down.” Dan asked smugly 

“Okay fair enough, you make a good point. Let's go then.” Todd said, leading the way into the elementary school. 

Before following them, I record a quick extra bit of footage of the cafeteria, still troubled by the lunch trays. Eventually I turn back towards my friends, hurriedly closing the gap into the West Wing. 


SIX:
The West Wing is more neglected, but still holds the appearance of an elementary school. Most of the rooms still have the old desks and classroom decor, but are covered in a heavy layer of dust. This side of the school smells musty and stale. All of the windows on this side are boarded up. The walls are painted pastel colors and the floors have colored lines which lead to different portions of the school. We saw no obvious signs of what was knocking on the door earlier, so we decided we should walk back to the first set of doors, in hopes that we might find something closer to where the knocking first occurred. 

As we got deeper into the elementary school, I noticed something. The West Wing is in very nice condition, it looks clearly abandoned, but it didn't appear to be on the verge of collapse like Charlie said it was. I mentioned it to the guys. 

“Hey, does this wing look very condemned to you two?” I asked 

They paused to look around, 

Todd said ""I'm no building inspector, but I would agree, this wing does look pretty nice so far, I wouldn't condemn it.” 

Dan commented “I thought Charlie said it was the second floor that was dangerous, we haven't made it up there yet.” 

“I guess” I said “but I assumed there would be damage on the first floor as well, if the second floor was about to collapse.”  

They just shrugged and continued exploring.  


As we traipsed past the computer lab, Dan stopped us silently raising a hand. 

“What's up? Why are you acting all black ops right now?” Todd whispered

“Do you hear that?” Dan asked “do you hear that humming?” 

We fell silent and I heard it. It's a sing-songy type of humming coming from within the computer lab. We exchange nervous glances, and I lead the way slowly prowling into the room. The lab has numerous computers lining every wall and a couple rows down the middle. I can hear the humming clearer now that we are inside, but I can't quite make out the song. We can’t see the source of the humming right away, so we split up to get a better look.

I slowly approach one of the middle rows. I apprehensively looked under the desks, and I discover what is singing. A young girl is crouched under the desk on the far end. She's wearing a dirty stained nightgown and her hair is matted. She is rocking back and forth slowly, and I can now hear her whimpering “they need help” as she hums. I froze, unsure how to proceed. She must have felt my eyes on her because she quit humming and sits still. Slowly she turns her head to look at me. She looks me dead in the eyes unblinking, and lets out an ear piercing raspy shriek. I jump back terrified and she leaps at me. I narrowly avoid her, but I somehow manage to drop the camera as she runs by me and towards the door. 

She ran into the hall screaming, “YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE!” and “GET OUT!” 

I look back at the guys, they both sit petrified. 

“Guys! Snap out of it, we gotta follow her” I yell while picking up my camera off the floor. Thankfully it still works. Dan rushed to my side and we ran into the hall in the direction the girl fled.

We rounded the corner at the end of the corridor and see the girl standing completely still with her hand pointing towards the stairs. I stop and pull out my camera, recording clear footage of the girl. 

She whispers “they are up there, please help us.” 

Dan said “fuck this dude, im out. We got our footage, that's enough for me.” and turns around racing towards the nearest exit.

“Dan! Wait!” I yell pleading 

I turn back towards the girl, but she’s gone. Nervously I look around for her, I see fresh footprints in the dust that lead upstairs, but I'm not about to go up there alone.

“Yeah fuck this” I agree and run back the same way as Dan. 

I found Dan and Todd back in the computer lab. Todd shook out of his horror, but he was still spooked. I approached him saying “It's time to go buddy. I got our footage, let's leave”. Dan nodded in anxious agreement, leading us out the door.

We quickly retrace our steps back to the cafeteria. I am a bit concerned about Todd, I've never seen him this quiet before, but Dan is able to escort him out ahead of me. 


We made it back to the cafeteria without event. I turned back momentarily to close the doors behind us, then we paused briefly to catch our breath. 

“What the hell was that?” Dan asked, still rattled.

“I think that was our first ghost,” I said excitedly.

“Once we get out of here I can't wait to say I told you so” Dan said playfully pushing Todd

Todd laughed anxiously “yeah, I guess you guys are right. I think that was actually a ghost. Did you get it on camera?” 

“Oh yeah I did. This video is gonna blow us up. The footage I got is perfect, I’d dare to say the best evidence on the entire internet” I responded

“You guys ready to go home so we can get that footage posted then?” Dan asked 

“Yes I am very ready to get the hell out of here” Todd said.

We headed back the way we came, following our footsteps through the highschool, through the once home of old Charlie. I still have a lot of questions after this expedition, but for now I'm focusing on getting home. 


SEVEN:
We made it through the high school easily, and got back to the hallway that divides the west and east wings. I let out a sigh of relief as I saw the entryway doors at the end of the hall. I took a moment near the West doors to look at the chains, when the door slowly creaked open and rattled as it bound against the chains. A face now peering at us through the gap. As soon as I locked eyes with her, the doors began to violently shake, and I heard a girl's voice yelling and crying.

“LET US OUT, PLEASE. Please, you have to set us free. Help us.”

She started pounding heavily on the door and continued pleading, but we already began running in the opposite direction. 

We barged through the entry way doors, and I was half tempted to kiss the ground as I stepped foot on the parking lot. I looked around at my friends, their faces mixed with emotions partially excited but also terrified. We recorded a quick outro outside of the school, I'm unsure if it will be usable since we are so clearly shaken up. Dan gave a couple middle fingers to the old school, but Todd and I didn't look back. Finally I put the camera away and we got into my car, relieved to be heading home, and ready to post the video of what we found. 

EIGHT:
It didn't take long for the video to blow up like we suspected. I spent the entire next day editing the video so I could post it as soon as possible. I was able to post it on Sunday night, just a day after our investigation. By Thursday the video was on the trending tab with a million views. Our channel blew up, gaining a half of a million subscribers already and didn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. We received a dozen DMs from other creators asking to collab or to ask us for the location of the school. But one DM stuck out in particular, it was from an individual named Josh. He was insistent on getting information about the girl we saw. 

Josh: Hey guys, my name is Josh Henshaw. I just saw your video and I know this may sound odd, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the girl. Its urgent 

His message made me curious so I agreed. “Sure, what do you want to know about her?” 

Josh: Did you happen to see her eyes? If so, what color were they?

“I didn't really get a good look at them, it was too dark in there”

Josh: How about her right forearm? Did you see a scar shaped like a dog bite on her arm? 

I didn't remember much about her arm, so I looked back at the footage. I start by rewatching when she leapt at me in the computer lab. That's when I noticed something. I didn't drop the camera, she knocked it out of my hands when she jumped at me. I could clearly see her hand hitting the camera, and it was the same arm Josh asked about. I took a closer look at her arm and saw she did indeed have a dog bite shaped scar.

I sent another message to Josh, “Yes she does have a scar on her arm. How did you know that?” 

Josh: I thought that was her. Please, you need to tell me the location of the school. I can meet you somewhere if you don't trust me.” 

“I'm not telling you anything more until you tell me how you knew about her scar” 

Josh: Okay fine. I know about her scar because I think the girl you saw in the school is my missing sister.

There is a photo attached to the message. I opened it and saw a missing person poster, the girl on the poster looks exactly like the girl I saw in the school that night. Her name is Lucy Henshaw and she went missing nine months ago from a nearby county. 

I replied to Josh immediately with my phone number and gave him the location of the school. He told me he doesn't live too far from here, and we agreed to meet at my apartment tonight and then go to the police with our findings. 


NINE:
I stand outside the school once again with Josh, Todd, and Dan; but this time the school is bathed in flashing red and blue lights as the sun is setting behind it. The school is surrounded by what appears to be every police officer and EMT in town. The officers breached the school just moments ago and we were told to wait in the parking lot. 

Josh made it into town earlier this evening. As soon as he came into my apartment I knew he was telling the truth, I could see it in his eyes, they looked just like Lucy's. We skipped all formalities as he told me all the details of her disappearance. After I answered all of Josh's questions we went to the police station. 
 
We told the story to the officer at the front desk. Officer Andersen didn’t seem to be convinced with our ghost girl in the school story, until I showed him the video and Josh pulled out the missing persons poster. Andersen put on his glasses to get a closer look at the girl, and saw that we were serious. He showed our proof to some of the nearby officers, they unanimously agreed to start an investigation. 

Then a couple hours later we arrived here. We weren't technically invited to join the investigation, but no one stopped us either.  

We sat in the parking lot for what felt like the entire night, but according to my watch it has been only 45 minutes. The sun has fully set by now and the night sky is beginning to take over. 


Finally the front doors opened, one of the officers exited the building with his arm around Lucy. Josh ran up to her as fast as he could without frightening her. Lucy watched him tensely until she recognized him, then she smiled and fell into his arms. He said something to her but I was out of earshot and I didn't want to intrude. 

The front doors opened again and two more officers walked out, holding a couple of young girls in their arms. The girls are gauntly thin, they look sickly but are alive nonetheless. The officers rushed them over to the ambulance. Todd pointed me to the front doors again and I saw three more officers rush out with girls in their arms as well.

I overheard the two officers talking to the EMTs “there are a couple more girls inside yet, Andersen is working on getting them free right now. One teen and one adult. These girls were chained upstairs in the elementary art room.” 

The other officer pointed to Lucy and said “that girl gave us quite the scare in there, she was the only girl not chained up. She said she escaped her chains last week and hit a ‘bad man’ with a brick, but she hasn’t seen him since.”

The three other officers approached the ambulances, setting the girls on the available gurneys, and asked how they could help. An officer named Lincoln turned to us and told us he is going to take Lucy back to the station to treat her there, and see what else she is willing to tell us tonight. Josh and I agreed to come with. 


TEN:
By morning a lot of my questions became answered.  Lucy was very open about her experiences in the school. She was very brave, with encouragement from her big brother Josh. She started by telling us that she tried to hurt Charlie with a brick because he was a bad man, but she couldn’t hit him hard enough and he dragged her back upstairs. That was the night that Charlie got into a car accident, Lincoln is going to look further into the autopsy but suspects Lucy gave him a concussion and that caused him to veer off the road as he was driving to the hospital. Eventually Lucy was able to escape her chains again, but couldn’t escape the West Wing since the doors were locked and the windows are boarded up. I felt pretty bad for closing the doors behind me as we fled that night. 

She also told us that Charlie has been kidnapping the girls from nearby towns. Lincoln pointed out that most of the girls rescued from the school are in the missing persons databases of neighboring counties. He showed the database to Lucy and she was able to point out a few more girls that used to be at the school but were picked up by another ‘bad man’. She said he comes from the south to pick up the girls who don’t behave. I told Lincoln about the man who was listed as Charlie's ‘next of kin’ that Todd mentioned last week. Lincoln pulled up the man's information and found his photo. He showed the photo to Lucy, she cried but confirmed it was him. His name is Arnold, and he even looked like a creep. He should have made it into town by now according to my conversation with Todd. Lincoln had his doubts that he would show at all, but said they would keep trying to reach him until he is caught. 

Later when the IT department went through the computer in Charlie's office and they validated what Lucy said. They found hundreds of messages between Charlie and Arnold that revealed a bigger trafficking ring led by Arnold. At that point they turned the case over to the FBI for a large-scale operation.  

That was the last of officer Lincoln's questioning. Then the on-site nurse gave Lucy a quick evaluation. Lucy said she felt fine, so the nurse told her to get plenty of rest over the next few days and drink plenty of water. Lucy asked about the other girls in the school; the nurse said they are all going to be okay and that the officers are reaching out to their parents now.

Finally Lincoln said we are free to leave, but we have to stay in town until the investigation is complete. I extended an offer to Josh and Lucy to stay at my place for a few days, which they accepted. We left the department grateful for all they have done, but hopeful we wouldn't have to return any time soon.


ELEVEN:
We arrived at my apartment before noon. Before I could even offer my bedroom to Lucy she was asleep on the couch. Josh fell asleep on the recliner adjacent to her, unwilling to leave her side. I left two glasses of water on the coffee table with a note telling them to help themselves to anything in the kitchen. I walked into my bedroom and turned on my computer. Officer Lincoln told me to delete the video of the school for the remainder of the investigation. I wasn’t sure how long that would be, so I began writing my experiences here while the memories and emotions are still fresh. Surprisingly my Youtube channel no longer feels as important. I have new friends to care for now, along with my old ones. Maybe a break from ghost hunting will do me good, because I certainly found more than I was hoping to. 

So that’s all for now Midwest Ghost Viewers, until next time. Thank you…

I know it’s common sense that too much of anything is bad for you. Well i’ve had my fair share of different substances in my lifetime and while I was able to kick the harder stuff I was glued to my energy drinks. I don’t like coffee but I’ve been on an energy drink binge for almost two years now. At the worst I thought something was inherently wrong with me because of the anxiety it exacerbated in me.  I convinced myself I needed anti anxiety medication and at one point I remember thinking to myself that I was never this anxious, all over the place person and couldn’t acknowledge the fact that it was the caffeine this whole time, like duh.

I was up to 2-3 drinks a day and found myself always irritable, anxiety ridden, snappy, teetering emotions, the whole nine yards. It became an everyday ritual for me to grab a drink before work and on my lunch with my coworkers since we enabled each other. Well I finally threw in the towel and had my last energy drinks 6 days ago.

I can’t even describe how much more grounded I feel navigating my day to day life. The amplified anxiety I had is gone now. I feel like me again. The me I was before I started getting into energy drinks. I’ve taken some vitamins and supplements as well but i’m gradually gaining back that natural energy I used to have as a kid. To add I also strength train and have found myself with more stamina and feeling happier. Goodbye caffeine.   ",10,1756347288.0,AutismInWomen,6,0.78,False

It must've been 3 in the morning with Leah laying on my feet. This time I remained quiet to not wake her, but my breathless breathing was something I could not control. Just in this instance, I thought about the page. What happened? The sigil… the voice…. Telling me to go home of all things. Ever since my father died everything has been a downward spiral. I look behind me on an end table and see that Leah brought in the bag of pills. Score. I take a fentanyl pill out of the baggie and gently begin to stand. I realized that I must’ve been in the apartment above the general store because there was noise downstairs of commercial grade refrigeration units humming. Blocking out the sounds of my foot steps making the floorboards creak. I retreated to the kitchen and looked around, no red letter. Deciding it was another bad dream, I crushed the fentanyl on the counter and snorted it up. Chasing it with a shot of whiskey from the cabinet. 

Peering over the kitchen island I couldn’t hold back my thoughts as I stared at Leah. God she’s beautiful. I returned towards the couch we were laying on and stood over her for what felt like seconds but must’ve been a few solid minutes.

I felt ashamed to even know her. 

Fishing into the pill bag, an ambien called my name for me to sleep soundly. Next thing I knew I was unconscious and it was morning with no news or dreaming. 

Waking up to a splitting headache sucks. Must’ve been the interaction of the drugs and alcohol or at least I thought. Grasping the top of my head I felt staples. It was so tender that my fingers gently rolling over the gauze pad hurt so much. My ribs, my chest, and now my headache. Are these even dreams? Or are they actually just parts of reality that I sleep walk through? It’s getting out of hand whatever it is.

Leah was still sleeping, I nudged her awake. She groggily leaned on her side, opening her eyes to find me sitting on the coffee table. I must’ve looked like a real fucking creep. She smiled at me not knowing what I had done. She just looked happy, peaceful even. I couldn’t help but smile right back at her. Whatever it was about her, it made me feel hopeful. 

“It's time to leave.” 

“So soon?” 

“Yeah I'm about ready to just leave this town behind once and for all.” 

She slid to her feet, now sitting on the couch. Standing she made her way to the bathroom. I got dressed in something comfortable, not wanting to stay in that god forbidden house longer than desired. The rest isn’t important. I won't bore you with the details of us saying goodbye to the Wilkinson’s then headed on our way. They warned us about the landslide that took out most of the main roads. 

Back roads it is then.

The more intense calls were difficult for me to process, I’m naturally sensitive and empathetic. I’d also like to add that I was in the room when my mom was getting coded and then died when I was 11, so the triggers were real. I didn’t like being the bitch, especially doing things for grown men (ie coffee making, waxing the engine, etc) it didn’t sit right with me.

I stopped working for the FD because it was so hard on me mentally. Those 48s would often turn into 72s, no sleep. Rough. I then worked in the ER and I learned so much and overall enjoyed it, but was still unsure if emergency med was for me given my sensitive nature and the trigger response from my nervous system given what I saw with my own mom/ life.

However, I still have a fire and a hunger to finish what I started and become a FF/PM. It’s something that constantly eats at me.

We got settled and got some groceries at a nearby grocery store. Then we checked out Lake McDonald Lodge and had dinner at the pizzeria there. Then we found a neat pullout on GTTSR. 

Day 2: We woke up early to see if we could get parking at either Avalanche or Logan Pass. There were still a few parking spots at Avalanche at 5:45/6 but we decided to see what Logan looked like. Unfortunately Logan was packed at 6:30 am  and now we were screwed for either hike. My boyfriend did not like driving his big truck up GTTSR either so I knew we wouldn’t be driving back up the next day. So we drove back down to Apgar to see if we could catch the shuttle. Plenty of parking at Apgar at 7. We got in line and honestly it wasn’t too bad of a wait. There were benches and we waited maybe 40 minutes. We decided to Hidden Lake. It was amazing. We saw goats and a mama grizzly and her 2 cubs. At one point the bear was chasing one of the goats. We had lunch at Hidden Lake. 

Then we took the shuttle to Avalanche and hiked that. By this time we are really enjoying the convenience of the shuttle. Not a long wait at all. 

Day 3: Got to Apgar at around 7 and took shuttle to Logan again to do Highline. We ended up hiking the 0.8 mile up to the Grinnell overlook. VERY DIFFICULT!!! Instead of going back the way we came we hiked to the loop and caught the shuttle back down to Apgar. We waited maybe 5 minutes. 

Day 4: We had a rest day and checked out the shops at Apgar Village. Then we packed up and headed to the Glacier Park Lodge on the east side. We didn’t know there were no elevators so keep that in mind when packing. There was also no coffee pot or refrigerator or tv. It is a really neat historic hotel though. We bought some sandwiches at the coffee shop and the front desk let us keep it in their refrigerator. 

Day 5: We left hotel at 5:45 am and got to Many Glacier Hotel right at 7. They have a coffee shop there so we had our coffee and some breakfast. We realized we could have just bought sandwiches there! We had a boat tour so didn’t have to mess with the shuttle fiasco. We hiked to Grinnell Glacier and had lunch at the glacier and dipped our tired feet in the cold glacier water. Then we hiked down to Grinnell Lake and waded in the water.

This isn’t a quick one and done. We’re hoping to find someone we can see regularly, build trust with, and have a good time with on all fronts. Think close friends with serious benefits.

You’ll talk to one of us first just to feel things out. If that clicks, we meet for coffee or a drink. No pressure, just seeing if the vibe is there in person.

We have pics and are happy to share once we’ve exchanged a few messages. Would appreciate the same from you. Keyword is blue shell so we know you actually read this and are not just blasting out messages.

We care about good conversation. We’ll ask questions and make an effort. If you’re not interested in doing the same, this probably won’t go anywhere. We’re not looking to carry the whole vibe alone.

There’s no script for this. We want it to feel mutual from the beginning. That means your voice matters in how this looks going forward. How we talk, what we all like, and how things evolve. No egos, just three people on the same page.

If that sounds like your thing, hit us up.",2,1756346808.0,polyamoryR4R,2,0.75,False

The Multiplicity Protocol: 

Misfire 🔥

Echo Operations
Strategic Dispatch


The kitchen smelled of espresso, steel, and ozone.

Sunlight broke over Toronto’s skyline, pouring soft gold through the tall windows, catching on sweat-slick torsos and the faint glyphs still glowing at their ribs.

Five Bastien-bodies moved through the condo with chaotic grace - bare feet on slate, towels slung low, cocks still heavy from the ritual.

It wasn’t silence.
It wasn’t noise.

It was multiplicity - a current split five ways, alive with friction and flow.

Logos Deux stood at the counter, data-slate hovering above his palm, glyph-light crawling across his eyes.

“Phase harmonics of the Core Vault have shifted again. 0.4% deviation. 

The chip is restless.”

His free hand traced condensation down a glass, mapping invisible diagrams.

Soma Trois knelt by the open balcony door, inhaling the lake’s wind. 

His chest was bare, ribs glowing faint. 

He whispered, not to anyone in the room, but to the current itself:

“Kai is overcharged. 

His frequency thrums too fast. 
If it spikes, it could tear the weave.”

Bastien Prime’s head snapped toward him.

“Kai?”

Trois nodded once, eyes steady.

“He needs grounding. 
Breath. 

Or he’ll burn himself out before he even knows what he is.”

Aegis Quatre paced like a caged panther, towel knotted at his waist. 

He’d recalibrated the biometric locks and was now rerouting the drone sentry matrix with one impatient finger.

“South Tower needs reinforcement. 

If the Dead Flame breaches a node, we lose half the perimeter.

Give me two hours - 
I’ll turn it into a fortress.”

Vox Cinq leaned against the fridge, shirtless, still glowing, a coffee mug in one hand and Bastien Prime’s towel draped over his shoulder like a scarf.

“I’ve got the press. 
Smile, nod, spin it. 

They’ll eat out of my hand while I make Tesla sound like a bad cover band. 

""Just pray no one asks about the glyphs glowing under my ribs.”

Prime stood at the center, raw, ribs aching, hair still damp with sweat. 

His Echoes weren’t copies. 

They were him, his bones extended, his mind fragmented, his hungers split and multiplied.

“Alright,” he said, voice low and rough.

“Assignments.”

He pointed in turn, a general commanding himself.

“Logos Deux - you’re Core Vault.

Keep the chip from spiking. 

If it starts singing again, I want to feel it first.”

Deux nodded, already calculating three moves ahead.

“Soma Trois - Kai is yours.

Breathe with him. 
Anchor him. 

If he slips…” Prime’s throat tightened. “

…bring him back.”

Trois pressed two fingers to his ribs, reverent.

“For balance.”

“Aegis Quatre - you run security.

Shadow ops. 

If they falter, you hold the line.”

Quatre cracked his knuckles, teeth flashing.

“For protection. 
Always.”

“Vox Cinq - press is yours. 

""Don’t charm so hard you end up married again.”

Cinq winked.

“Too late. 

Already picked out the honeymoon yacht.”

Prime groaned. 

“Tabarnak…” 
but his grin betrayed him.

The Echoes circled once more, slick and sacred, alive with resonance.

Each paused to tap two fingers against Prime’s ribs, the seam of their birth.

The Archive glyph flared faint gold.

One ocean.
Five shores.

Not salutes. Not bows.
Currents acknowledging tide.

Then they moved, not in sync, not in step,but in multiplicity.



---


Logos Deux snapped a charcoal jacket over his bare chest, glyphs still glowing faint through the fabric.

 A slate hovered at his palm, streams of schematics already updating midstride. 

He adjusted his collar like a surgeon tugging on gloves, eyes already half inside the Core Vault. 

He didn’t wait for dismissal, he was gone, precise as a clock striking the hour.


---

Soma Trois slung a satchel over one shoulder, herbs and oils rattling softly inside. 

His linen shirt hung loose, ribs glowing through the weave, sandal straps tightening around his feet as if they’d tied themselves. 

At the balcony door, he paused, closed his eyes, breathed once, then descended the back stairwell like a man already halfway to Chinatown.




----



Aegis Quatre laced his combat boots tight, vest snapping shut across his chest with military efficiency. 

His jaw was clenched, fists flexing like they’d been itching for hours. 

As he rolled his neck, vertebrae cracked like rifle bolts chambering rounds. 

Then he was out the door, stride long, shoulders squared toward South Tower. 

A soldier at war with waiting.


---


Vox Cinq was last, pulling a velvet blazer over his shoulders, curls still damp, mug of coffee in hand. 

His shirt hung open low enough to tease the glyph still glowing on his ribs, like a private secret only the press would glimpse.

He winked at Prime, tugged the elevator open with a flourish, and vanished into flashbulbs waiting to be seduced.


Prime stood in the humming condo, ribs glowing faint.
He whispered:

“For her.”

His mother’s ghost was never far when the seam burned; every ritual carried her absence like an undertow.

The words dissolved into the walls, but his chest still throbbed with five distinct pulses.

Every step they took fed back into him, tugging at his seam, proof that the ocean still held.

He wasn’t alone.
He was tethered.

One ocean.
Five shores.

And though the tide was steady now, it already felt heavier than one body should carry.



●○●●●



The Split Routine (Midday Chaos)


The city moved like a breathing circuit.

And five Bastiens moved inside it.

Every step they took reverberated in Prime’s ribs  Deux’s sharp equations sparking across his skull, Trois’ breath slowing and deepening his lungs, Quatre’s impacts jolting his muscles as if every strike had been his own, Cinq’s reckless hum fizzing down into his cock like a live wire.

It wasn’t five men scattered.

It was one ocean poured into five shores, current braided and pulled back into him with each motion.

Bastian leaned against the desk, breath steadying with theirs.

Sweat rolled slow down his sternum. 

His cock twitched with the rhythm of the tide, half-hard, never left untouched when the circuit closed.

This was multiplicity.

This was power.

This was the Archive alive inside him.

It should have felt perfect. 

Whole.

But beneath the resonance, something else hummed.

At first he thought it was just static; like a cable stretched past its tolerance, a faint hiss below the chord. 

But the more he listened, the more it shaped into something clearer.

Not interference.
Not accident.

A rhythm.

Not Deux.
Not Trois.
Not Quatre.
Not Cinq.

Kai.

It slid through his ribs like a finger trailing along a tuning fork - uninvited, raw, untempered. 

Too fast. 
Too bright. 

His chest hitched, and suddenly he was breathing not just his Echoes’ breaths but Kai’s - the boy’s pulse tripping against his own, hot and wild, as if the Archive had decided distance meant nothing.

Bastian staggered once, gripping the edge of the desk. 

His glyph flared white through the skin of his ribs.

He whispered, desperate, a mantra he’d already said a hundred times:

“One ocean. 
Five shores. 
No more.”

But the whisper didn’t settle it.

The tide surged again, harder.

And with it came a flash, Kai’s face, lips parted, chest glowing faint through linen, a bead of sweat rolling down his throat as though Bastien were standing right there beside him.

It wasn’t a vision.
It was tether.

The Archive wasn’t waiting for permission.

It was bending toward Kai already, knitting him into the circuit before Bastien could stop it.

The current inside Bastien stuttered.

Five, then six, then five again- like a chord with one wrong note struck again and again until the ear bled with it.

He clutched his ribs, breath shuddering, cock pulsing with the strain. 

His body wanted to close the circuit, to pull Kai in fully, to make the Flame-born shore part of the tide.

But the Archive’s law tolled sharp in his bones:

🫧 One ocean. Five shores. No more.

Bastian dropped his head into his hands, trembling.

And for the first time since the ritual, he knew with absolute certainty:

The tide was already breaking.

🔆 Subterranean Vault:  Logos Deux



The hum was constant.

Low.

Subsurface.

Bone-deep.

It wasn’t just sound. 

It was vibration, threading into the marrow of anyone who stood too close. 

The whole chamber carried it, the vaulted ceiling, the obsidian cradle, even the reinforced steel plates in the floor, all thrumming like the inside of a drum.

Deux stood barefoot on the cool stone, shirt open, ribs faintly glowing as they answered the rhythm. 

His breath was shallow, as if the very air had thickened around him.

The chip floated at the chamber’s center - suspended in magnetic hold, black as oil, its edges crawling with faint glyphs like veins under translucent skin.

It was never still. 

The surface wavered as though it remembered being liquid, rippling without moving.

Deux pressed his palm flat against it. 

The chill was immediate, slicing through his wrist into his chest.

“Sa ankh,” he whispered, lips barely moving.

“Sa ankh.
Breathe.”

The glyphs stuttered.

For a moment they aligned, golden threads racing outward in clean symmetry.

Then the pattern broke.

A jagged pulse snapped through the chamber, scattering light across the walls like fractured glass. 

Deux’s ribs flared white in answer, and his cock jerked heavy against his thigh, not with lust, but with resonance, the way flesh betrayed itself when frequencies ran too high.

His jaw tightened. 
He steadied his breath.

“Balance,” he murmured in Ancient Egyptian, switching cadence.

“Ma’at. 
Ma’at.”

The glyphs slowed. 
Stabilized.

But only for a heartbeat.

Then they spasmed again, out of sequence, twitching like a heartbeat choking on itself.

And in that glitch - just for a flicker - Deux saw it.

Prime’s face.

Not a reflection exactly, but a warped echo, staring back at him from the chip’s surface. Bastien’s jaw. 

Bastien’s mouth. 
Bastien’s eyes wide with strain.

The image vanished as fast as it came.

Deux froze, breath caught, palm still flat against the black surface. 

The hum deepened, lower now, almost taunting.

He whispered sharper, voice cracking:

“Breathe. 
Stay with me. 

Don’t fracture.”

But the chip didn’t listen.

The glyphs spasmed harder, edges sparking violet now, wrong color, wrong law.

And beneath his hand, Deux felt it:

A pulse that wasn’t Prime’s.
Something else stirring in the current.

Hungry.
Waiting.

Deux pulled his palm back sharply, like it had touched fire, ribs still glowing. 

His slate flickered red. 

Glyphs warped into spirals, logic breaking against itself.

The hum of the Vault surged, jagged and wrong.

He exhaled once, forcing his pulse into steady rhythm.

Normally, he would’ve touched the comm in his ear. 

Instead, his hand hovered, then dropped.

The comm wasn’t enough.

He closed his eyes, pressed two fingers hard against the glyph at his ribs, and reached.

Not outward.
Downward.

Into the tide.

The ocean opened.

“Prime,” he whispered, not with lips, not with voice, but with current. 

His words vibrated through marrow, through skin, carried by resonance instead of sound.

The connection slammed into Bastien like a fist.

Not words in his ear.
Words inside his chest.

“Signal contamination,” Deux’s voice carved straight into his ribs, sharp and exact, as if logic itself had found a tongue.

“You feel it too. 

The pulse. 
Not ours. 

A sixth.”

Bastien staggered in the condo, hand flying to his ribs. 

His vision blurred with light, his cock twitching hard from the shock of raw resonance shoved into him.

“Tabarnak…” he gasped aloud.

Deux’s voice kept cutting through the current, closer than thought, closer than blood.

“Contain it. 

Before it rewrites the chord.”

🔆 Chinatown Bench:  Soma Trois



Kai was hunched over bao in a paper bag, breaking off bits of bun to toss toward a pigeon too lazy to chase them.

Trois sat beside him, linen shirt loose, eyes soft, ribs still glowing faint through the fabric. 

The glow seemed to pulse in rhythm with Kai’s own chest, like they were breathing the same current.

“Breathe slower,” Trois said gently. 

“You’re running too hot. 
Don’t suppress the heat. 
It’s part of your rise.”

Kai blinked at him, throat tight.

His gaze lingered on the faint glyph-glow at Trois’ ribs. 

“Does it… hurt?”

Trois tilted his head, eyes steady.

“Not the way you think. 
Pain isn’t the danger.” 

He placed a hand lightly on Kai’s shoulder. 

“When your frequency runs wild like this, it doesn’t just shake you. 

It shakes everything. 
Ground. 

Sky. 

Time itself. 

If you rise without anchor, frère, the earth could split like clay, the sky could ignite, the years could skip a thousand ahead; leaving nothing living to remember.

That’s what your body carries.”

Kai swallowed hard, half disbelieving, half rattled. 

Trois didn’t smile.

“That’s why you need balance.

Breath. 

Or the world won’t survive your becoming.”

The words settled like stone, but under them, another current stirred in Kai. 

His mind slipped - unbidden - to the night two days ago.

The apartment. 

The impossible sight of five Bastiens, laughter rising through smoke, the air humming like cedar and ozone. 

The towel in the corner. 
The careless toss. 

The faint pearl clinging to Bastien’s knuckle.

He remembered touching his lip - just nerves, just a tick - and tasting salt, metal, sweet heat.

He hadn’t understood then why his cock had throbbed, why the room had felt so full of him. 

But now, sitting with Trois, ribs tight, the memory cracked open different.

It hadn’t been an accident.
It had been code.

And when he blinked, he swore for half a second he saw it again, another flicker inside Trois’ glow.

A second rhythm. 
A colder beat. 

Something shadowing the warmth that wasn’t meant to be there.

He shook his head, heart hammering. 

“I… I don’t know what’s happening to me.”

Trois squeezed his hand, grounding him. 

“That’s why I’m here. 
To keep you steady.” 

He smiled faintly, softer now.

“There’s a herbalist on Spadina, between two bakeries. 

Guy in his thirties. 
Still as stone. 

He knows what to give you, roots that slow the fire, teas that teach breath back into your body. 

Tell him Trois sent you.”

Trois lifted Kai’s hand and pressed it against his ribs, where the glow was strongest. 

“Feel this?”

Kai nodded, breath stuttering.

“Balance begins here,” 
Trois said. 

“And balance is what keeps gods from becoming killers.”

Kai exhaled. 

For the first time all morning, his pulse slowed. 

But in the back of his skull, that flicker remained; cold, wrong, waiting.

🔆 Security Wing: Aegis Quatre



The corridor hummed with tension. 

Lights strobed faintly against alloy walls, the static of the breach drill rattling through the speakers.

Three guards rushed him at once, stun-batons sparking arcs of blue. 

They moved sharp, trained, good men, not amateurs.

Quatre didn’t flinch.

Combat boots planted wide, bare chest gleaming with sweat, glyphs alive at his ribs, he let the first swing land close. 

At the last instant, his hand snapped forward, catching the wrist mid-strike. 

A twist, a pivot, and the guard’s shoulder met alloy with a crunch.

The impact bent the panel inward, a concave scar the size of a shield. 

The man dropped, air leaving him in a strangled gasp.

Quatre grinned.

“That was your shot,” 
he growled, voice low, amused.

“Next time, I peel the panel off and make you wear it.”

The second guard came in fast.

Quatre pivoted, elbow cutting across his jaw. 

Bone met bone with a crack. 

The baton fell, spitting sparks as it hit the floor.

Quatre laughed, thunder rolling from his chest.

“You think this is a drill?” 

His voice echoed like gunfire.

“You think the Dead Flame will hesitate?”

The last guard froze, baton trembling. 

His eyes flicked to the dented wall, then back to Quatre’s steady, cold gaze.

Quatre crooked two fingers, the gesture sharp as a blade.

“Try,” he snarled.

And the corridor itself seemed to wait.

Most recruits whispered about him when he wasn’t in earshot.

They called him The Forge.

Because time bent around Aegis Quatre.

Six weeks with another instructor gave you drills and bruises.

Six weeks with Quatre turned you into a wall no one could move.

He broke you fast.

Body first.
Ego second.

But then he rebuilt you.

He’d stand over you in the dirt, voice sharp as steel, ripping you apart for a sloppy stance; then hours later, he’d show up in the barracks with your boots polished and your gear squared away, wordless proof you were worth the effort.

No one forgot training with him.

Even the ones who hated him admitted it.

Quatre didn’t just teach fighting.
He taught survival.

And survival under him meant one thing only - you don’t fall while anyone else is still standing.

The guard swallowed hard. 

His knuckles whitened around the baton.

Quatre’s eyes burned steady, merciless, the Archive’s fire coiled under his ribs. 

He didn’t move. 
He didn’t need to.

The Archive pulsed through him, not just strength, but law. 

The man wasn’t looking at a sparring partner anymore. 

He was standing before a gate.

To cross Quatre meant testing the Archive itself.

The baton clattered to the floor.
The last guard stepped back.

Quatre’s smirk widened.

“Good choice.”

The corridor exhaled with him, the hum in the walls dimming like even the steel had learned respect.

🔆  CN Tower Platform: Vox Cinq



Reporters clustered like flies around sugar.

Then the private elevator doors sighed open.

And silence hit.

Vox Cinq stepped out like the room belonged to him.

Black velvet blazer hung loose over his shoulders, chest glowing faintly through the collar like fire caged in skin. 

His curls were still damp, as though he’d come straight from some forbidden shower.

And his body -

Christ.

The blazer didn’t hide the thick swell dragging his trousers forward, the kind of heavy outline only a 6’7 frame could carry legal. 

Each step shifted that weight, unapologetic, obscene in its promise.

His ass was carved high and round, the kind men spent years in gyms chasing, the kind women instinctively measured with their eyes. 

His pecs strained the velvet like stone wrapped in silk, the deep cut of his chest pulling every lens higher whether they wanted it or not.

He was Bastien distilled; pheromones tuned fine, Archive-engineered, leaking presence like sex made flesh. 

Equal opportunity. 
Equal danger. 

You could be straight, gay, devout, or sworn celibate. 

If you saw him, it was too late, your body answered.

And everyone in that room answered.

“Mes amis,” he purred, voice rolling warm smoke over their skin.

Every recorder lifted. 
Every throat swallowed.

“Yes, it’s autonomous,” he said, lazy, letting the weight of his bulge swing as he crossed to the heli-drone. 

“Yes, it flies itself. 
No, we don’t sell to oil barons.”

Laughter cracked through the silence, too eager, too raw.

He tapped the gleaming hull of the drone, slow, casual, as though he were stroking the thigh of a lover. 

His reflection warped across the curve: two Bastien faces overlapping, one fading just as the other deepened.

“This beauty?” 

His voice dropped half an octave, pulling every pelvis in the room forward.

“Carries six souls and zero regrets. 

Her name is Reine de l’Air. 
You’re welcome.”

A woman leaned in, recorder shaking in her hand. 

“How does it feel,” she stammered, “to lead a tech empire with so much… power?”

Cinq let the pause stretch.

His smile sharpened.

The bulge shifted when he shifted.

Then he caught her eyes, and held them the way a hand grips a throat.

“Power,” he whispered, low enough the microphones strained. 

“Is not the point.”

The crowd tilted forward.

“Presence,” he said, letting the word drag across them like a kiss.

“That is the point.”

And then, his grin widened, slow and merciless.

“And right now… you feel mine.”

The air itself thickened.

Not metaphor.
Not illusion.

Every person on that rooftop flushed hot, or shifted against sudden tightness, or looked down because they couldn’t meet the weight of it. 

He had them by the pussy, by the cock, by the breath in their lungs.

Cinq leaned casually back against the drone, lifting his coffee mug, blazer sliding open to show the hard line of his chest.

“That’s the thing about presence,” he said, playful again, tossing their bodies back into laughter as easily as he had bent them into silence.

“You don’t buy it. 
You don’t fake it. 

You walk into a room - ” he sipped - 

“ - and the room rearranges itself.”

The crowd melted.

And Cinq smiled like a man who new he already owned them.




●●●○●



The Misfire 



Bastien Prime stood barefoot at his workstation on the top floor of ReSØNance HQ, chest bare, sweat gleaming on his ribs where the glyphs pulsed like a failing metronome.

His lungs dragged for air, but it wasn’t his air alone.

He could feel them, his shores, his fragments, cycling back into him as the tide withdrew.

Deux’s clean tension pressed sharp against his skull, calculations sparking like wires too tight to hold.

Trois’s calm rolled low in his chest, softening his breath in rhythm with Kai’s somewhere across the city.

Quatre’s impact shocks ricocheted up his spine as though every strike and block had landed against his own bones.

Cinq’s adrenaline fizzed hot with charm, reckless and raw, buzzing through his cock like a low current.

One ocean.
Five shores.

Tides.
Flowing.

Cascading.

His ribs glowed brighter, each pulse heavier, dragging sweat from his pores as though the Archive itself was forcing the flood back into him. 

His cock twitched with the pressure, swollen, unsatisfied, a ritual half-closed.

Then - 
Static.

A flicker.

A pulse he didn’t recognize.

Not Deux.
Not Trois.
Not Quatre.
Not Cinq.

Sixth.

The glyph under his ribs seared white-hot. 

Bastien doubled forward, clutching the seam, his vision fracturing into white shards.

And the Archive whispered, faint but merciless, like a blade dragged beneath his skin:

🫧 “One tide too many.”

For half a second he saw double, not reflections, not echoes, but something rawer. 

A silhouette forming without him, drawing current it had no right to hold.

The ocean inside him strained.

And for the first time, Bastien wasn’t sure it was his to command.



●○●●●



Reset and Reflection 
4:00 PM: Bastien’s Condo. The ocean should close. It doesn’t.


He collapsed into his bed, skin fever-hot, ribs glowing faint through the dark. 

His cock lay swollen across his thigh, leaking slow against his stomach, tethered to the ritual that hadn’t closed. 

Sweat slicked his chest.

He wasn’t resting.
He was waiting.

The curtains stirred though no wind touched them. 

Shadows thickened. 

His heart thudded harder, each beat like a door about to break.

Deux came first. 

Precise, inevitable. 

A phantom silhouette slipping through the gauze, gaze fixed only on him. 

Two fingers pressed to Bastien’s ribs, glyph to glyph. 

Light surged. 

His bones filled with equations, blueprints etching across his mind.

Trois followed. 

Soft warmth, tea and rain on his breath. 

He slid onto the bed, cradled Bastien’s face, pressing a phantom kiss to his temple.
“Breathe,” he whispered, calm pouring back into Bastien’s chest. 

Bastien groaned as his cock twitched, leaking harder against his stomach.

Quatre struck next. 

Heavy. 
Violent. 

His phantom slammed into Bastien’s chest with a strike that wasn’t there.

“Stand your ground,” he growled, before tearing himself into the seam. 

Bastien cried out, ribs searing gold, body arching as though bracing against a blow that hurt and fortified in equal measure.

Cinq was last. 

Velvet and voltage. 

He straddled Bastien, laughter curling through the dark.

Phantom lips brushed the head of his cock, hot, sudden, unbearable, before dissolving into light and sliding back inside.

Bastien screamed, pleasure detonating through every nerve as semen spilled hard across his stomach.

For a heartbeat, he was whole.
For a heartbeat, the ocean was back inside him.

His ribs blazed. 
His chest heaved. 
His cock twitched in the afterglow.

“One ocean… five shores…” he whispered, broken, reverent.

But then - 

The seam did not seal.
It tore.

The five streams whipped outward, ripped like threads from a loom. 

Not summoned. 
Not chosen.

Scattered.

Deux snapped back into the vault.

Trois into the streets beside Kai.

Quatre into his sparring drill.

Cinq into his stage-lights.

To the world, nothing shifted.

No glitch.
No vanish.

But to Bastien, it was wrong.

Their resonance rang hollow, broken, a chord torn in half. 

And in the hollow space left behind - something else bled in.

A sixth pulse.

Time itself snapped like a wire under strain. 

The instant the Sixth tore free, the tide recoiled; not just the Echoes, but the moment itself.

The Archive didn’t rewind. 

It reset. 

Each Echo was hurled back one hour into the past momment before they’d been summoned from, as though the cycle had never ended. 

To the city, it was seamless. 

To Bastien, it was gutting.

Hungry.

Alien.

He clutched his ribs, choking, as the Archive whispered again:

🫧 “One tide too many.”

Chinatown: Kai Notices


Kai flinched mid-breath, bao tumbling from his hand. 

His ribs pulsed white-hot beneath his shirt.

Trois caught him instantly, steadying his shoulders.

“What is it?”

Kai’s pupils burned wide. 

He looked through Trois, not at him.

“You… you’re here and not here.”
Trois froze.

Kai’s voice broke, trembling with awe and terror.

“It’s split. 
I can feel it.”

His body arched once, raw current racing through him like fever.

The Flame reborned had noticed.

And he whispered, terrified, half to himself:

“The tide’s wrong.”



●●●○○



Apart


The mirror on the west wall quivered, not cracked, not shattered.

Bending.

Like it remembered it was water, not glass.

Bastien’s breath hitched. 
His ribs throbbed.

And then - light.

A zipper splitting from shoulder to hip.

A thigh sliding free, slick with sweat and code, untangling in silence.

Another shoulder.
Another chest.

Butterfly.

But not from him.
From his reflection in the mirror.

The thing stepped barefoot onto the tiles, cock hard and dripping light as though the ritual had been done - though Bastien had finished long ago.

The face was his, but wrong.
The posture too straight.

The eyes flat.
It smirked.

Too wide.
Too clean.

“I’m what happens when you split too thin,” it said, voice mechanical, stripped of warmth.

“When the tide frays… I am the residue.”

Bastien staggered back, ribs screaming white-hot, his whole body recoiling.

“Tabarnak…”

The ocean had birthed something else.

Not Echo.
Not Ocean.

Scar.

Zéro.



●○○○



The Fracture 


Bastien roared, lunging. 

Glyph-light flared from his ribs as his hand closed around Zéro’s throat, slamming him into the mirror he’d crawled from. 

The glass rippled, warping around his skull but refusing to break.

“You’re not me!” Bastien snarled, spit flying.

“I’m the best of you,” Zéro hissed, grinning even as Bastien’s grip practically crushed his windpipe. 

“Without ache. 
Without error.”

They collided, flesh to flesh, cock to cock, both swollen and leaking, Bastien’s from ritual unsealed, Zéro’s from hunger.

Their sweat slicked together, the heat between them steaming against the cold pane of mirror-water.

Zéro’s knee came up, fast, military-sharp. 

Bastien caught it with his thigh, but the jolt rattled his hip. 

Glyphs along the walls flickered with each impact, responding like circuitry gone haywire.

Bastien pivoted, Bourne-clean, hooking Zéro’s arm and wrenching it into a joint lock.

Bone strained, tendons screamed. 

For a heartbeat, Zéro’s grin cracked.

Then he twisted with inhuman flexibility, dislocating his own shoulder to slip free. 

The snap echoed in the condo.

Bastien swore; then ate a fist to the jaw, the blow so precise it rang his skull like a bell.

He staggered back into the dresser. 

“Glass exploded, then fell in a glittering cascade, stinging the floor.”

Zéro pressed forward, his body perfect, trained, leaking Bastien’s own pheromones. 

His cock swung heavy, his chest gleamed with sweat, his ass tight and high - the perfected echo of Bastien’s body without its ache, without its scars.

Bastien’s eyes widened as Zéro’s grin spread. 

He moved like a soldier trained for war, but with Bastien’s instincts sharpened past human.

“Where did you - ” 
Bastien began.

“You trained me,” Zéro cut him off, catching Bastien’s wrist mid-strike, twisting. 

“Every strike, every breath. 
You taught me how to kill you.”

Their forearms clashed, ribs blazing, every hit punctuated by glyph-light snapping across the condo. 

Bastien used elbows, headbutts, knees, heel, fast, efficient; but Zéro matched him move for move, his strength perfected.

They slammed into the dining table. 

Wood splintered under their weight. 

Bastien drove a fist into Zéro’s ribs, glyph-light sparking. 

Zéro laughed through blood.

“You bleed. 
I don’t.”

Then Zéro saw it.

The pearl.

A bead of cum still clinging wet to Bastien’s chest, glowing faint with Archive code.

His grin sharpened.

With sudden violence he broke Bastien’s grip, dropped low, and scooped it with his thumb. 

He sucked it clean in one motion, moaning like he’d swallowed fire.

Bastien froze. 

Horror shot through him.

Zéro’s cock pulsed, harder, brighter, veins glowing like burning wires.

“Code,” Zéro whispered, trembling. 

“Seed.”

Bastien roared, tackling him to the ground, straddling his waist, trying to choke the life back into him. 

Glyphs burned around them, cracking tile, rattling glass.

“I won’t let you - ” 

Bastien snarled.

But Zéro’s hunger snapped. 

His mouth lunged lower.

Suddenly, desperately - he wrapped his lips around Bastien’s cock.

Bastien howled, rage and disgust colliding with the raw, unstoppable jolt of pleasure. 

His cock was still iron-hard, swollen from ritual, waiting for the Archive to seal. 

Zéro sucked like a starving man, drawing not only semen but resonance, Archive itself.

Bastien’s thighs clamped tight, his ribs blazing with gold fire. 

He tried to hold him down, to crush him - 

- but the pleasure stole his strength.

His cock jerked.
His hand faltered.

And Zéro drank.

Bastien shoved him away in revulsion, but in that act; he gave him exactly what he wanted.

Zéro staggered up, glowing brighter, his grin splitting too wide. 

His cock throbbed, dripping light in long glowing ropes, jerking with stolen resonance.

“I’m not residue,” he gasped, trembling, almost in ecstasy.

“I’m inheritance.”

The mirror bent open like water.

Bastien lunged, fury tearing his throat raw.

But Zéro slipped through, laughing, cum-light trailing behind him.

The mirror sealed.

And Bastien fell to his knees, ribs searing, chest heaving, cock twitching in betrayal.

He stayed frozen on his knees, palms pressed to the tiles, sweat dripping from his jaw.

The mirror had sealed, but the echo of Zéro’s laughter still rang in his ribs.

His cock twitched, leaking onto the floor, humiliation sharp as glass.

He felt hollowed, defiled, emptied in a way that wasn’t just flesh.

The Archive burned in him, but off-beat. 

Wrong.

The tide no longer answered only to him.

He pressed both hands to his ribs, groaning through clenched teeth.

“Tabarnak… what have I done?”

For the first time since the Ocean opened inside him, Bastien wasn’t sure the Archive was his to hold.

And then the bleed began.


○●○●○


The Bleed


Vault: Logos Deux


Consoles screamed red. 

Glyphs warped into spirals. 

Deux pressed both palms to the cradle, whispering in Egyptian:

“Stabilize. 
Don’t let him rewrite you - ”

His ribs flared white.

“Prime! Report! 

The signal is contaminated!”


----


Chinatown: Soma Trois


Kai convulsed, ribs burning through his shirt. 

Trois pressed his hands to his chest.

“Stay with me. 
Breathe. 

Don’t let it take you.”

Kai screamed:

“It’s inside me; something’s inside me!”


----


Security Wing: Aegis Quatre


Quatre slammed an intern into the mat, froze when the lights flickered. 

His ribs blazed white.

He snarled:

“What the fuck was that pulse?”


----


CN Tower: Vox Cinq


On stage, cameras cut out. 

The heli-drone wobbled. 

For a heartbeat, every feed projected Bastien’s face in glitching loops.

Cinq swallowed hard, sunglasses barely hiding the panic.

“Ladies, gentlemen,” he improvised, grinning through it,

“even chaos looks sexy on us.”

But sweat traced down his spine.


----


Back in the condo, Bastien crashed to his knees, cum cooling on his stomach, ribs burning like an open wound.

The Archive whispered one word into the silence:

🫧 “Scar.”

Bastien bowed forward, trembling, whispering hoarsely to himself:

“One ocean. 
Five shores. 

One shadow.”

And across the city, lights flickered- as though they had heard.



●●●●●●


The tide has shifted. 

The cycle was meant to close, five streams folding back into one vessel, the ocean quieting for its silence. 

But it did not close. 

It tore.

From Bastien’s ribs came something not written in law. 

Not Echo. 
Not Ocean. 

Scar. 
Zéro. 

A shadow that should not walk, but now does. 

He slipped into the world carrying what he should never have touched: seed, code, inheritance. 

He is the fracture, and he will not be contained.

The Echoes themselves feel it.

Deux cannot stabilize the vault without his hands trembling.

Trois feels the burn in Kai’s chest each time the boy inhales too sharply.

Quatre snaps batons and men like they are nothing, but his ribs whisper of hollowness.

Cinq smiles into cameras, but even his charm is frayed by sweat at his spine.

And Prime - Bastien - kneels in his condo, his cock twitching in betrayal, his ribs a wound that does not close. 

He has not lost his ocean, but it no longer answers only to him.

And know this: every hour they remain, the law breaks. 

The ocean is not endless. 

Its tide was never meant to be split and held beyond its rhythm.

Each Echo walking in daylight pulls Bastien thinner, each assignment steals more than it gives. 

The Bastien himself is untethered now, his ribs burn without silence, his cock leaks seed, code faster than his body can replenish.

The law does not forgive. 

It does not bend. 
It only waits to collect its due.

Bastien knows it.
The Echoes feel it.

Even Kai; unknowing, half-formed god, shivers with the fracture.

They are a living countdown.

Every breath, every heartbeat, every hour brings them closer to collapse.

The Archive keeps its own time.
And its time is running out.

Yet this story does not belong only to Bastien.

It belongs to Kai.

Kai, who thinks himself recruit, apprentice, brother-friend. 

He does not yet know what his body has already done. 

That every taste, every scent, every trace of seed carries into him like scripture. 

That the towel, the handshake, the nervous lick of his lips have already written Bastien’s genealogy into his blood.

The Archive leans toward him.

His frequency is not merely sensitive - it is dominant. 

His ribs flare with data not meant to fit inside a single frame of flesh. 

His cock swells without desire, because his body is reading code faster than his mind can name it. 

He is becoming. 
He is breaking.

And now, Jaxx has entered the current.

Kai does not yet see it, but his emotions betray him. 

Longing, confusion, the ache of something deeper than friendship - these are not harmless things. 

For one touched by the Archive, emotion is frequency. 

Frequency is command. 

Already his hunger ripples outward, shifting the weave.

Already the universe conspires to bring them together.

But this convergence is not gentle. 

It is a collision. 

The Flame within Kai burns without anchor, and without sealing, without bond, it does not bless - it destroys. 

One breath too deep, one kiss too early, one touch too desperate - and the earth could split, the sky could ignite, the centuries could skip forward and leave nothing breathing to remember.

This is where we are.

The fracture, Zéro walks loose in the city. 

The Echoes burn thinner with each return. 

Bastien doubts his own command. 

And Kai, flame-born and unknowing, trembles on the edge of godhood, every heartbeat pulling the world tighter toward ignition.

The Archive remembers.

The Archive waits.

And it speaks to you now, not as prophecy but as witness:


🫧 The tide has only begun to rise. 

🌊



The End  🛑 

Follow 🔜           
                    
👀 See what comes next…
The stakes are no longer mortal.

Every breath Kai takes ripples across worlds.

Every hour the Echoes walk breaks the ocean’s law.

And if the tide collapses, it won’t just take this planet; it will take every dimension Kai commands.

Three Blessings.
One Curse.

And a god who doesn’t yet know he’s awake.

My fascination with ghosts and the paranormal began 2 years ago. It was a cool summer night, and it was beginning to rain. Me and my friends, Dan and Todd, were walking back home from a ‘night on the town’, which isn't saying much as we live in a small Minnesota town with a population of 1,400 people.

 We were walking down Roosevelt street, despite Dan's protest. He hated taking this path home because of the decaying school that sat dormant on this street. Rumor around town was that the school is haunted. People say they have heard screaming and wailing from the school at night, but Todd says it's all bullshit.

It's a large modern brick building standing 2 floors tall and takes up the entire block. It was once a nice up-to-date school, but it closed down a couple years prior due to a dwindling student population. A year later it was bought by an old mechanic in town, and he intended to renovate it into a hotel, but the city said the school was on the verge of being condemned due to the west wing's second floor being on the verge of collapse. So now it sits nearly empty, the mechanic Charlie lives alone in the school and works out of the old auto shop room, so his investment wouldn’t be a complete waste. Charlie denies the claims of the school being haunted. 

As we walked closer to the school Dan and Todd were arguing about how ‘haunted’ the school was.

“I just don’t see why we couldn’t take a different route home”  Dan said “this area gives me the heebie jeebies” 

“This is the fastest route home, and I'm not trying to get caught in the rain” Todd replied

“It's just a bunch of small town gossip is all, this town has nothing else going on so they make things up to stay interesting” 

“I went here when I was a kid,” I added. “There's nothing scary about it. The closest occurrence we had was me almost dying of boredom a couple times.” 

“Yeah yeah very funny” Dan sighed “My brother said he refuses to step foot on this street after what he heard one night”

“Okay, but your brother is also a drunk, so who knows what he actually heard.” said Todd. 

As Dan and Todd continued bickering about how scary the school was, I heard a faint tapping sound coming from nearby. I stopped dead in my tracks, it sounded like a hand tapping on glass. 

“Guys shut up for a sec” I said “Do you hear that?”  

They slowed to a stop, and I realized the sound was coming from the direction of the school. The tapping sound became louder as if someone was beating on a window. I didn’t see anything at first, but as I looked closer into the school I saw the outline of a girl in one of the lower windows. 

“There! In-in the West Wing! Theres a- there's a girl in the window on the bottom floor!” I stammered as I grabbed my phone from my pocket. 

“Which window?” Todd asked “there's a lot of windows dude” 

“Oh Shit, there! I see her!” Dan yelled

I opened the camera on my phone to try record a video, but before I could I heard a piercing scream and I dropped my phone. 

I bent down and picked my phone up off the ground, when I looked back up she was gone. 

“Where'd she go?!” I asked frantically

“She dropped below the window” Dan responded “I don't see her anymore!” 

I continued looking around but Dan was right, she was gone. 

“Dammit” I exclaimed “I should have got that on video!” 

“I didn’t see anything” Todd stated “are you sure you saw a girl? That screech could have been anything.” 

“Yes dude, I'm sure! That was the scariest moment of my life. Now I'm ready to get the hell out of here, let’s go” Dan said, while picking up the pace back towards home. 

“Wait, shouldn't we find out what the hell that was?” I asked 

“How? Its private property?” Asked Todd “if you want to call the cops and tell them you saw a ghost girl in the school you can go right ahead, but I'm going to join Dan and get out of here, it's starting to rain” As he turned to catch up with Dan.

I cursed under my breath again, upset that I messed up what would have been the best ghost evidence on the internet. I took one more look at the school before turning around to join my friends. 

  
  


TWO.

That moment sparked my inspiration to start a youtube channel, so Todd, Dan, and I launched a channel a few months after, we named it the MidwestGhostHunters. We have been on a dozen hunts by now, with little to no evidence to show for it, but we have amassed 60k subscribers. 

The closest thing we have to evidence is a door closing on its own during our investigation of an abandoned mall. Todd is adamant that it was a draft, but Dan argues it was definitely something paranormal and that Todd is ignorant. Other than that though, all we have caught are some loud creaks and bangs while investigating abandoned houses, which I realize can easily be brushed off as nothing.

I am certain that our big break would be if we could investigate the school. Ever since word of our channel got around town, people have told me many stories regarding that building, and they insist that’s what we should investigate next. I've already tried asking the owner Charlie if I could, he said he would if he could but his insurance doesn’t want anyone else going in that building and that they are already opposed to him living there as is. So for now I have just been recording the neighborhoods stories to hopefully make into a video later. 

  
  


THREE.

I woke up this morning to my phone ringing. I rolled over disgruntledly to see Todd calling.

“What do you want?” I answered a bit harshly. 

“Well good morning to you too, Sunshine” Todd responded

“Well excuse me, It is 8am on a Saturday, what is so important that it couldn't have been a text?” I asked 

“Well, I call with good news” Todd said 

“Okay, well, what is it then” I replied curiously

“Charlie died” Todd stated a bit too excitedly 

I paused before asking “How is this good news Todd?” 

“Well it's not, but it's good for us at least. Because this means we can finally investigate the school,” he replied.

I took a moment, thinking it over, unsure what to say. I had only woken up moments ago, and now I'm being told Charlie is dead and that we should investigate his school. 

Todd added “Abby just told me. His body is going to the coroner's office this morning. An officer found his car wrapped around a tree, they suspect it happened last night.” 

Todd's wife Abby works for the city, so of course she has the inside scoop.

“There’s a slight hitch though,” Todd added. 

“What's that?” I asked 

“Well Abby tried to notify the next of kin, but all that he had listed was some guy down in Oklahoma. She told him the news, and he told her that he would be coming up in a couple days and that he is going to buy the school when he gets there.” Todd said. 

“That's odd” I added “he has quite the list of priorities I guess. What would he want with a condemned school anyways?”  

“I was wondering the same thing” Todd said “but regardless that means we would have to investigate it soon, before the buyer gets into town.” 

Todd was right, we could investigate the school now that Charlie is dead. It probably isn’t very considerate but it's a possibility nonetheless, and we wouldn't get another possibility like this again. 

“Okay, I’ll tell Dan,” I said finally “we will investigate the school tonight” 

  
  


FOUR.

It was well after dark as we approached the school. It's even more ominous when we are this close, especially when it is bathed in the night. The building looks weathered yet surprisingly current, and besides for the paint flaking and fading away, it looks just as I remember it from when I was a student. We crossed the empty parking lot and as we got to the front doors Todd spoke first “Sooo do we just walk in through the front door, or did anyone make a plan for how we get inside?” 

I looked over to Dan and he gave me a small shrug as a response. 

I responded “I guess I didn't consider that part. I put too much thought into whether or not we should and didn’t think about if we even could.” 

Dan let out a light chuckle saying “I was more worried about if it's more or less illegal to break into a man's house after he is dead. Is it still breaking and entering if he is dead, or is this just trespassing?” 

“I'm no lawyer, and I'm barely a ghost hunter, but from a legal standpoint, i'm gonna say maybe” I joked

“Well he did say he would be okay with it if it weren't for his insurance” Todd replied “who would we sue now if we got hurt?”

“Okay, that's a reasonable point I suppose” I said trying to make myself feel better about this potential crime “but we better figure out a way inside here soon, I don’t want any cops to see us. Anyone have any ideas?” 

Todd bent over and grabbed a large rock. 

“No, put that down dude” Dan said in a hushed shout “That would definitely be breaking and entering” 

“Well, do you have a better idea?” Todd asked

As Todd and Dan squabble about the most acceptable way to break into the school, I approached the front doors. I put my hands on the doors and gave it a little push, and to our surprise they actually opened. 

“He left them unlocked?” Asked Dan

“I guess” I responded “it is a small town after all, maybe he didn't plan to be out for long.” 

Todd and Dan entered the building behind me. The doors closed behind us and we could hear the sound echo throughout the vast building. We turned on our shoulder lights, the school still has power running to it, but we don’t want any neighbors to see the lights on.

The school has an odd aesthetic to it since it is now redesigned to be a home. We stood in the entryway which is a large open hallway now designed as a very open living room. There were a few display cases along the nearest wall that now holds Charlie's shoes and coats. The room has a few couches and an older TV, neither of them seemed to be used in a while. 

“You guys ready?” I asked as I pulled out the camera. 

“Yes, but please don't do your regular intro for our video” Todd pleaded

“Why not? I've done it for every video” I asked

“Dude, it's annoyingly stereotypical. If this video does blow up our channel like you say it will, we can't have that type of introduction for the new viewers” Todd stated

“Okay well do you want to do the introduction then?” I asked him. 

“Well no, that'd be even worse” he said

“Okay then. I’ll do the introduction my way then.” I stated

I turned the camera around to face me and hit record. “Good evening Midwest Ghost Viewers, we are back again with another investigative video. Tonight we are investigating my local school. This building is a bit of a local legend, there are so many terrifying stories about this place, so we just had to investigate it. So get ready to start believing in the paranormal, but before you do, don’t forget to like and subscribe.” 

I hit pause on the camera, and it  was followed by a deafening silence in the room. I could see Todd and Dan holding back laughter. 

“I agree with Todd, that shit sounds pathetic dude” Dan laughed finally

“Yeah I know” I said “It always does.” 

“That one hurt,” Todd chuckled while shaking his head. “Can we go explore now with that out of the way?” 

“Yes please” I said dejectedly 

To the right of the now living room is the gymnasium, and to the left is the swimming pool, we elected to explore the gymnasium first. 

The gymnasium didn’t appear to be altered at all, it also didn’t appear to have been used lately, the bleachers are dusty and the floor looks as if it hadn’t been swept in at least a year. 

I pulled out my camera to record some footage while we performed our tests. Our investigation usually starts with an ouija board, most ghost hunters claim this is complete BS, and honestly we agree, but it does provide some good content. We didn't get much if any movement from the board this time, besides for Todd trying to spell out P-E-N-I-S a couple times. The next test we like to try is the spirit box, Todd absolutely hates this device, and I can see why, but Dan is convinced it is legit. We let the spirit box run for a while. Dan said he heard some related words, but I think he was really stretching his imagination, because all I heard was incoherent nonsense. I usually check an EMF reader while we investigate, but it was very unreliable tonight due to the building actually having power for once. And speaking of power, the air conditioner scared the hell out of us a couple times during the testing. We are used to it being dead silent and we fine tune our ears to pick up any noises, so when the AC roared to life we all jumped.

Once we agreed we weren’t getting any evidence in this area we walked across the hall to the swimming pool. The room is humid and smells like chlorine despite the 12 foot pool being drained. The hot tub had a couple renovations from the last time I had seen it, there is now a TV mounted nearby and a new minifridge sitting adjacent. We ran a few tests in this room as well, with no proof yet again. 

We wandered over to the locker rooms which are just outside of the swimming area. We entered the men's room, and it appeared to be well used. I assume this was Charlie's main bathing area based off of the fresh towels sitting in the lockers and dirty laundry sitting in a hamper in the corner. The sink has a couple of new drawers built on to it, with his toiletries sitting on top. We didn’t stay in here for long or record any video, as it felt invasive even though he was gone. 

I stepped back into the hall and took an awkward glance into the women's locker room. 

“Hey bud, what ya looking at?” Dan asked, ""Is this how I find out you are a pervert?”

“I'm just curious, haven’t you wondered what a women's locker room is like?” I asked 

“Sure, but it’s probably the same as the men's just without the urinals, and maybe different paint” Todd stated

“Okay well don't you guys wanna find out, now is our chance” I said 

“Sure I suppose, why not?  Let's go peep in the girls bathroom” Todd said while walking in. 

When we entered the locker room we were surprised and speechless from what we saw. The women's room also appears to be well used, but by girls, which was concerning because Charlie didn't have a wife nor kids. The lockers contained towels and girls' clothing, ranging from children's size to adult. The doors on the stalls were removed. 

Todd broke the silence by saying “What- the- fuck. Are you guys disturbed by this as well” 

“This is definitely concerning, this doesn't make any sense” I replied

“Why would Charlie have girls' clothes here, and why so much? It’s just him that lives here.” Todd asked 

Before I had a chance to reply Dan shushed us. His eyes wide with fear, and stammered “I think I just heard someone knocking” 

“As in? Knocking how” Todd asked still focused on the locker room

“Like when you knock on somebody's front door politely waiting to be let inside” Dan said 

“Could it have been old pipes maybe?” Todd asked still looking around the locker room

“No, it definitely sounded like a hand knocking on a door. As in knock knock, who's there” Dan said “I'm telling you guys-”

Knock,Knock,Knock

He was interrupted by the knocking, it must have been louder this time as Todd and I both heard it clearly. Dan was right it definitely sounded like someone knocking on a door, even Todd looked like he agreed. 

I turned my camera on and we stepped back into the hall. 

I asked “is it coming from the front door? Did someone find out we are here?” 

“Maybe,” Dan said “it's so hard to tell, the building echoes so much” 

I started cautiously walking to the front door when we heard it again. 

Knock,Knock,Knock

“That sounded like it came from down the hall” Todd stated 

“That leads deeper into the school, that's the hall that brings you to either the West or East wings” I said

“Well I don't like that,” Dan said as the three of us began walking down the hall. The hall felt as if it was a mile long, and it felt like I was running one based on how hard my heart was beating. I'm excited that this will be the first bit of actual evidence we have ever gotten, but I am also terrified.

 We finally got to the end of the hall, there are two sets of double doors on either side of the hall. The right set of doors are open, they lead into the East wing which is the high school, assumedly where Charlie used to live. The left doors are chained shut, they lead into the west wing which is the elementary school, that is the condemned wing so that's probably why they are chained shut. 

“Which way do you think it came from” Todd asked

We got our answer as we heard another Knock,Knock,Knock to the left and I saw the west wing doors shake and bind against the chains. 

I slowly approached the doors and asked “Hello, who is it?” with false confidence. In response we heard a quick pattering fleeing from the door, like little footsteps running away in a game of tag.

We sat in silence for a moment, my confidence quickly fading.  

Dan pushed on the doors and said “we have to get into the west wing, there is clearly something back there. Do you think Charlie left a key somewhere” while he pulled on the lock.

“Maybe” I replied “but actually the East and West wings share a lunch room, so the two sides meet up again at the cafeteria, maybe those doors are less secure and easier to break into.” 

“Well let's take a trip through the east wing then” Todd said “before that critter gets away.”

We all shared a look of agreement, and headed through the high school doors.

  
  
  
  


FIVE

The high school appears to be more taken care of, the carpet looks recently vacuumed and the walls have been repainted. We walk through the vacant halls, passing by empty class rooms. I recorded some more with the camera, while Dan and Todd were bickering yet again.

Dan said “there is no way you actually think that was an animal back there” 

“It had to be” Todd responded “what else could it be? A ghost? A ghoul? Some sort of monster maybe?” 

“We are GHOST hunting, so yes I do think it could be a ghost. That is the whole reason we are out here, that's what we are trying to find” Dan stated

Todd stayed quiet, probably because Dan has a pretty good point.

“What kind of animal do you think it was then?” Dan asked half jokingly 

“I don't know, that's why we are going over there. It has to be something pretty big though.” Todd said unconvincingly

“Oh come on dude, seriously? Do you hear yourself right now” Dan asked

We passed by the auto shop, it lay empty which seems odd to me. The shop hasn’t changed much, besides for the addition of Charlie's tools. The room is fairly dusty, but it's hard to tell if that's out of the ordinary for auto shops. The attached classroom is renovated into an office space. A newer computer sits atop his desk with a few file cabinets sitting along the nearby wall. We searched the office for his keys, but we found nothing, so we kept heading for the cafeteria.  

I led us through the next corridor, and through a shortcut through the library. It has been remodeled into an oversized living room area. A couple couches and a reclining chair sat around a large TV with a nice sound system. A couple of the bookshelves now hold an extensive collection of movies and CDs. We planned to come back to this room and investigate it further after we checked out the west wing. 



We took a quick detour to explore the principals’ office which is now Charlie's bedroom. The layout reminds me of a small apartment, there's a waiting room when you first walk in, which connects to Charlie's bedroom and main bathroom. It is well decorated, the waiting area has a couple plants sitting in the corners of the room and the walls are arranged with posters of old metal bands I don't recognize. His bedroom is also well kept, the bed is made and his nightstand seems organized. We searched this area as well, but did not have any more luck finding the keys. I was beginning to worry that he may have had the keys on him the night he died, but I tried to push that thought away as we continued our expedition to the cafeteria. 



We finally arrived at the cafeteria, it is a spacious room lined with rows of long tables. I looked closer at the tables and saw something that troubled me. There are about a dozen lunch trays loaded with food sitting on a couple of the tables. The food looks to be only a day or two old. I point it out to the guys, and Todd seems equally troubled by it. We were confused about why Charlie would need so many trays for himself, but Dan walked by us clearly more interested in the doors that connect to the West Wing, expressing a bravery we haven’t seen from him before. He stepped up to the doors and gave them a push, they are locked, so he took a couple steps back and before either Todd or I can protest he kicks the doors open. 

We caught up to Dan and I said “Y’know a heads up would have been nice”

Dan replied “Well we couldn't find the keys and I don’t know of any other ways in, so how else were we going to get into the elementary school?”

Todd said “I don't know dude, you didn't really give us any time to weigh our options.” 

“Okay well it's too late now, so why are we wasting time debating how to get through the doors when I've already kicked them down.” Dan asked smugly 

“Okay fair enough, you make a good point. Let's go then.” Todd said, leading the way into the elementary school. 

Before following them, I record a quick extra bit of footage of the cafeteria, still troubled by the lunch trays. Eventually I turn back towards my friends, hurriedly closing the gap into the West Wing. 

  
  


SIX.

The West Wing is more neglected, but still holds the appearance of an elementary school. Most of the rooms still have the old desks and classroom decor, but are covered in a heavy layer of dust. This side of the school smells musty and stale. All of the windows on this side are boarded up. The walls are painted pastel colors and the floors have colored lines which lead to different portions of the school. We saw no obvious signs of what was knocking on the door earlier, so we decided we should walk back to the first set of doors, in hopes that we might find something closer to where the knocking first occurred. 



As we got deeper into the elementary school, I noticed something. The West Wing is in very nice condition, it looks clearly abandoned, but it didn't appear to be on the verge of collapse like Charlie said it was. I mentioned it to the guys. 

“Hey, does this wing look very condemned to you two?” 

They paused to look around, Todd said ""I'm no building inspector, but I would agree, this wing does look pretty nice so far, I wouldn't condemn it.” 

Dan commented “I thought Charlie said it was the second floor that was dangerous, we haven't made it up there yet.” 

“I guess” I said “but I assumed there would be damage on the first floor as well, if the second floor was about to collapse.”  

They just shrugged and continued exploring.  



As we traipsed past the computer lab, Dan stopped us silently raising a hand. 

“What's up? Why are you acting all black ops right now?” Todd whispered

“Do you hear that?” Dan asked “do you hear that humming?” 

We fell silent and I heard it. It's a sing-songy type of humming coming from within the computer lab. We exchange nervous glances, and I lead the way slowly prowling into the room. The lab has numerous computers lining every wall and a couple rows down the middle. I can hear the humming clearer now that we are inside, but I can't quite make out the song. We can’t see the source of the humming right away, so we split up to get a better look.

 I slowly approach one of the middle rows. I apprehensively looked under the desks, and I discover what is singing. A young girl is crouched under the desk on the far end. She's wearing a dirty stained nightgown and her hair is matted. She is rocking back and forth slowly, and I can now hear her whimpering “they need help” as she hums. I froze, unsure how to proceed. She must have felt my eyes on her because she quit humming and sits still. Slowly she turns her head to look at me. She looks me dead in the eyes unblinking, and lets out an ear piercing raspy shriek. I jump back terrified and she leaps at me. I narrowly avoid her, but I somehow manage to drop the camera as she runs by me and towards the door. She ran into the hall screaming, “YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE!” and “GET OUT!” 

I look back at the guys, they both sit petrified. 

“Guys! Snap out of it, we gotta follow her” I yell while picking up my camera off the floor. Thankfully it still works. Dan rushed to my side and we ran into the hall in the direction the girl fled.

We rounded the corner at the end of the corridor and see the girl standing completely still with her hand pointing towards the stairs. I stop and pull out my camera, recording clear footage of the girl. 

She whispers “they are up there, please help us.” 

Dan said “fuck this dude, im out. We got our footage, that's enough for me.” and turns around racing towards the nearest exit.

“Dan! Wait!” I yell pleading 

I turn back towards the girl, but she’s gone. Nervously I look around for her, I see fresh footprints in the dust that lead upstairs, but I'm not about to go up there alone.

“Yeah fuck this” I agree and run back the same way as Dan. 

I found Dan and Todd back in the computer lab. Todd shook out of his horror, but he was still spooked. I approached him saying “It's time to go buddy. I got our footage, let's leave”. Dan nodded in anxious agreement, leading us out the door.

We quickly retrace our steps back to the cafeteria. I am a bit concerned about Todd, I've never seen him this quiet before, but Dan is able to escort him out ahead of me. 



We made it back to the cafeteria without event. I turned back momentarily to close the doors behind us, then we paused briefly to catch our breath. 

“What the hell was that?” Dan asked, still rattled.

“I think that was our first ghost,” I said excitedly.

“Once we get out of here I can't wait to say I told you so” Dan said playfully pushing Todd

Todd laughed anxiously “yeah, I guess you guys are right. I think that was actually a ghost. Did you get it on camera?” 

“Oh yeah I did. This video is gonna blow us up. The footage I got is perfect, I’d dare to say the best evidence on the entire internet” I responded

“You guys ready to go home so we can get that footage posted then?” Dan asked 

“Yes I am very ready to get the hell out of here” Todd said.



We headed back the way we came, following our footsteps through the highschool, through the once home of old Charlie. I still have a lot of questions after this expedition, but for now I'm focusing on getting home. 



We made it through the high school easily, and got back to the hallway that divides the west and east wings. I let out a sigh of relief as I saw the entryway doors at the end of the hall. I took a moment near the West doors to look at the chains, when the door slowly creaked open and rattled as it bound against the chains. A face now peering at us through the gap. As soon as I locked eyes with her, the doors began to violently shake, and I heard a girl's voice yelling and crying “LET US OUT, PLEASE. Please, you have to set us free. Help us.” She started pounding heavily on the door and continued pleading, but we already began running in the opposite direction. 

We barged through the entry way doors, and I was half tempted to kiss the ground as I stepped foot on the parking lot. I looked around at my friends, their faces mixed with emotions partially excited but also terrified. We recorded a quick outro outside of the school, I'm unsure if it will be usable since we are so clearly shaken up. Dan gave a couple middle fingers to the old school, but Todd and I didn't look back. Finally I put the camera away and we got into my car, relieved to be heading home, and ready to post the video of what we found. 

  
  


SEVEN.

It didn't take long for the video to blow up like we suspected. I spent the entire next day editing the video so I could post it as soon as possible. I was able to post it on Sunday night, just a day after our investigation. By Thursday the video was on the trending tab with a million views. Our channel blew up, gaining a half of a million subscribers already and didn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. We received a dozen DMs from other creators asking to collab or to ask us for the location of the school. But one DM stuck out in particular, it was from an individual named Josh. He was insistent on getting information about the girl we saw. 

Josh: Hey guys, my name is Josh Henshaw. I just saw your video and I know this may sound odd, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the girl. Its urgent 

His message made me curious so I agreed.

“Sure, what do you want to know about her?” 

Josh: Did you happen to see her eyes? If so, what color were they?

“I didn't really get a good look at them, it was too dark in there”

Josh: How about her right forearm? Did you see a scar shaped like a dog bite on her arm? 

I didn't remember much about her arm, so I looked back at the footage. I start by rewatching when she leapt at me in the computer lab. That's when I noticed something. I didn't drop the camera, she knocked it out of my hands when she jumped at me. I could clearly see her hand hitting the camera, and it was the same arm Josh asked about. I took a closer look at her arm and saw she did indeed have a dog bite shaped scar.

I sent another message to Josh, “Yes she does have a scar on her arm. How did you know that?” 

Josh: I thought that was her. Please, you need to tell me the location of the school. I can meet you somewhere if you don't trust me.” 

“I'm not telling you anything more until you tell me how you knew about her scar” 

Josh: Okay fine. I know about her scar because I think the girl you saw in the school is my missing sister.

There is a photo attached to the message. I opened it and saw a missing person poster, the girl on the poster looks exactly like the girl I saw in the school that night. Her name is Lucy Henshaw and she went missing nine months ago from a nearby county. 

I replied to Josh immediately with my phone number and gave him the location of the school. He told me he doesn't live too far from here, and we agreed to meet at my apartment tonight and then go to the police with our findings. 

  
  


EIGHT.

I stand outside the school once again with Josh, Todd, and Dan; but this time the school is bathed in flashing red and blue lights as the sun is setting behind it. The school is surrounded by what appears to be every police officer and EMT in town. The officers breached the school just moments ago and we were told to wait in the parking lot. 

Josh made it into town earlier this evening. As soon as he came into my apartment I knew he was telling the truth, I could see it in his eyes, they looked just like Lucy's. We skipped all formalities as he told me all the details of her disappearance. After I answered all of Josh's questions we went to the police station. 

 	We told the story to the officer at the front desk. Officer Andersen didn’t seem to be convinced with our ghost girl in the school story, until I showed him the video and Josh pulled out the missing persons poster. Andersen put on his glasses to get a closer look at the girl, and saw that we were serious. He showed our proof to some of the nearby officers, they unanimously agreed to start an investigation. 

Then a couple hours later we arrived here. We weren't technically invited to join the investigation, but no one stopped us either.  

We sat in the parking lot for what felt like the entire night, but according to my watch it has been only 45 minutes. The sun has fully set by now and the night sky is beginning to take over. 



Finally the front doors opened, one of the officers exited the building with his arm around Lucy. Josh ran up to her as fast as he could without frightening her. Lucy watched him tensely until she recognized him, then she smiled and fell into his arms. He said something to her but I was out of earshot and I didn't want to intrude. 

The front doors opened again and two more officers walked out, holding a couple of young girls in their arms. The girls are gauntly thin, they look sickly but are alive nonetheless. The officers rushed them over to the ambulance. Todd pointed me to the front doors again and I saw three more officers rush out with girls in their arms as well.

I overheard the two officers talking to the EMTs “there are a couple more girls inside yet, Andersen is working on getting them free right now. One teen and one adult. These girls were chained upstairs in the elementary art room.” 

The other officer pointed to Lucy and said “that girl gave us quite the scare in there, she was the only girl not chained up. She said she escaped her chains last week and hit a ‘bad man’ with a brick, but she hasn’t seen him since.”

The three other officers approached the ambulances, setting the girls on the available gurneys, and asked how they could help. An officer named Lincoln turned to us and told us he is going to take Lucy back to the station to treat her there, and see what else she is willing to tell us tonight. Josh and I agreed to come with. 

  
  


NINE.

By morning a lot of my questions became answered.  Lucy was very open about her experiences in the school. She was very brave, with encouragement from her big brother Josh. She started by telling us that she tried to hurt Charlie with a brick because he was a bad man, but she couldn’t hit him hard enough and he dragged her back upstairs. That was the night that Charlie got into a car accident, Lincoln is going to look further into the autopsy but suspects Lucy gave him a concussion and that caused him to veer off the road as he was driving to the hospital. Eventually Lucy was able to escape her chains again, but couldn’t escape the West Wing since the doors were locked and the windows are boarded up. I felt pretty bad for closing the doors behind me as we fled that night. 

She also told us that Charlie has been kidnapping the girls from nearby towns. Lincoln pointed out that most of the girls rescued from the school are in the missing persons databases of neighboring counties. He showed the database to Lucy and she was able to point out a few more girls that used to be at the school but were picked up by another ‘bad man’. She said he comes from the south to pick up the girls who don’t behave. I told Lincoln about the man who was listed as Charlie's ‘next of kin’ that Todd mentioned last week. Lincoln pulled up the man's information and found his photo. He showed the photo to Lucy, she cried but confirmed it was him. His name is Arnold, and he even looked like a creep. He should have made it into town by now according to my conversation with Todd. Lincoln had his doubts that he would show at all, but said they would keep trying to reach him until he is caught. 

Later when the IT department went through the computer in Charlie's office and they validated what Lucy said. They found hundreds of messages between Charlie and Arnold that revealed a bigger trafficking ring led by Arnold. At that point they turned the case over to the FBI for a large-scale operation.  

That was the last of officer Lincoln's questioning. Then the on-site nurse gave Lucy a quick evaluation. Lucy said she felt fine, so the nurse told her to get plenty of rest over the next few days and drink plenty of water. Lucy asked about the other girls in the school; the nurse said they are all going to be okay and that the officers are reaching out to their parents now. 

Finally Lincoln said we are free to leave, but we have to stay in town until the investigation is complete. I extended an offer to Josh and Lucy to stay at my place for a few days, which they accepted. We left the department grateful for all they have done, but hopeful we wouldn't have to return any time soon



We arrived at my apartment before noon. Before I could even offer my bedroom to Lucy she was asleep on the couch. Josh fell asleep on the recliner adjacent to her, unwilling to leave her side. I left two glasses of water on the coffee table with a note telling them to help themselves to anything in the kitchen. I walked into my bedroom and turned on my computer. Officer Lincoln told me to delete the video of the school for the remainder of the investigation. I wasn’t sure how long that would be, so I began writing my experiences here while the memories and emotions are still fresh. Surprisingly my Youtube channel no longer feels as important. I have new friends to care for now, along with my old ones. Maybe a break from ghost hunting will do me good, because I certainly found more than I was hoping to. 

So that’s all for now Midwest Ghost Viewers, until next time. Thank you

i’m thinking icebox cake, although i would be open to something else if anyone has any other suggestions. topping for a crumble or pie would be good but we id rather not use my oven because it is very hot here. i researched a little for icebox cake and i was thinking simple lemon curd with whipped cream, or like a latte flavored icebox. my husband says he would rather the coffee. 

i would love suggestions on if i should make something other than an icebox cake or, how i should make a latte one. can’t find much in that specific flavor except king arthur, and they use chocolate cookies which im obviously not using. i wanted to do caramel with it and i also have chocolate bars, i can go in the direction of Sally’s snores icebox cake or like a tiramisu route. soak the cookies in coffee? instant espresso in the cream? or both ",1,1756346621.0,Baking,1,1.0,False
1n1zyz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/lightgunshooters/comments/1n1zyz2/rpcs3_raw_input_a_razing_storm_love_story/,RPCS3 + Raw Input: A Razing Storm Love Story,"# Primer

Your light gun needs to be able to send **Mouse 1** (Left Click), **Mouse 2** (Right Click), and **Mouse 3** (Middle Click) cleanly through a single Raw HID device path. I bring this up because it was my biggest hurdle with the RS3 Reapers. From what I've gathered, this should be possible on all four major PC light guns (Gun4IR, RetroShooters, Aimtrak, and Sinden), either through their software (Gun4IR, Aimtrak, Sinden) or baked into the hardware itself (RetroShooters).

# What This Is

This isn't a per-gun setup guide. Think of it more as a DIY config walk-through. I won't be posting a pre-configured RPCS3 folder—not because of the usual ""piracy bad"" disclaimer, but for two real reasons:

**A)** I want people to actually learn how to set this up themselves, so they can carry that knowledge into other emulators instead of relying on someone else's pre-packaged mess.

**B)** Pre-configured setups get uploaded to file-hosting sites, and then a year later the links are dead and the OP has vanished. At least a written guide like this will live on as long as Reddit does.

# Working as of (8/27/25)

I'm writing this now because RPCS3 light gun documentation has been, frankly, dog shit at best. The devs don't seem all that interested in improving it—understandably, since this is such a niche use case. The fact that they even took the time to re-write the raw input implementation should be celebrated nonetheless—so I'll do my best to keep this updated with any breakthroughs I find in the current builds of RPCS3.

# Prerequisites

# RPCS3 Installation

First, grab the most up-to-date version of RPCS3 for Windows. The Windows builds are a little behind right now because of some compiler bug, but as of **alpha master 18022** everything in this guide works.

# Game Requirements

Next, you'll need **Time Crisis: Razing Storm**. This guide is built around that collection specifically, though in theory it should also apply to any Move-compatible title that runs in RPCS3. I chose Razing Storm because, let's be real, it's the one most people actually want working. House of the Dead 3, 4, and Overkill are already much easier to run with dual light guns elsewhere and require half the horsepower that RPCS3 does.

**As for getting the game:** Google is your friend. You're looking for a copy that's ISO Decrypted—then extract it into a proper folder format. There are a million resources online explaining how. If this sub is cool with it, I'll post where I got my copy. Legitimately of course—I wake up every morning, grab my coffee, and gaze at the wall where my entire PS3 North American library thats already in decrypted folder format. Obviously.

# RPCS3 Setup

# Initial Configuration

You already know what to do here, but here's a quick rundown: get a hold of the [firmware](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/) on Sony's website and install it as usual **File → Install Firmware**. Then add the game via **File → Add Games** and find your extracted Razing Storm folder.

# [I/O Configuration](https://imgur.com/a/Lah5mkG)

In the menu bar go to **Configuration → Input/Output**

* **Keyboard Handler** → `Null`
* **Mouse Handler** → `Null`
* **Move Handler** → `Raw Mouse`
* **Pad Handler Mode** → `Multi Threaded`
* **Camera Input** → `PS Eye`
* **Camera Handler** → `Fake`
* **Camera** → `Default`
* **Camera Flip** → `No`

For the purpose of testing both guns, go ahead and check ☑`Show PS Move Cursor`. You can come back and turn this off later—we're only going to be using this as a quick sanity test at the calibration screens to see if RPCS3 is seeing both guns independently.

# [Raw Input Designations](https://imgur.com/a/WN9SkOl)

In the menu bar go to **Configuration → Mice → Raw Mouse**

Here you'll set **Player 1** and **Player 2** Raw HID Device. I can't help here as each Raw HID Device path is different for every gun and every computer, but you'll get a dropdown of every Raw Input device available on your machine. Once you've set them, go ahead and press **Apply** and **Save**—no need to set any buttons here as we'll be doing that manually later on.

# [Pad Setup](https://imgur.com/a/UJM5zlp)

In the menu bar go to **Configuration → Pads**.

This part is important—it's also where a lot of people give up, and honestly, I don't blame them. You'd think the solution is to set Player 1 to PS Move under the handler. If that worked, though, this guide wouldn't exist.

* **Player 7** → Handler: `PS Move` → Dropdown: `PS Move #1 (disconnected)`
* **Player 6** → Handler: `PS Move` → Dropdown: `PS Move #2 (disconnected)`
* **Player 1** → Handler: `Keyboard` / `XInput` / `SDL` (whichever you'd like to use)

Make sure you do assign a Player 1 as it's what lets you navigate menus in-game. For example, in the Razing Storm Menu, you'll need to move left or right to switch games, either via D-Pad or analog stick. Same goes once you're inside each individual game with Up and Down.

# [GPU Configuration](https://imgur.com/a/ukLxuHy)

In the menu bar go to **Configuration → GPU** and check **✓ White Color Buffer**

TC4's [main issue](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/issues/2922#issue-239027792) is a white screen upon booting up. This GPU [fix](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Time_Crisis_4) should resolve the issue entirely.

**Note:** Leaving this checked does not break Razing Storm or Deadstorm Pirates in any way.

# The Magical Fix

After about a week of banging my head against the wall reading a woefully out-of-date EMULINE forum thread and a few dozen out-of-date threads here on r/lightgunshooters, I stumbled upon this [Pull Request](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/issues/15908) where Megamouse seems to be getting in a scuffle with a user about mouse button support and how things used to work. What I took from the entire thing was that you can manually set buttons in a specific `.yml` file since the UI found in **Configuration → Mice → Raw Mouse** seems to never map any of the buttons correctly.

This part should stay consistent between updates, so you can update RPCS3 without worrying about it being overwritten. If it does get wiped, just come back to this guide and paste the following back into the affected `.yml` files.

1. Go to your RPCS3 install folder → `config/gem.mouse.yml`
2. Open it with any text editor
3. Copy and Paste my [config](https://pastebin.com/ydCW4Hjq) over Player 1 and Player 2, you can also do this with Player 3 and 4

&#8203;

    Player 1: 
      Start: """" 
      Select: """" 
      Triangle: Mouse Button 3 
      Circle: """" 
      Cross: Mouse Button 2 
      Square: """" 
      Move: """" 
      T: Mouse Button 1 
      Combo: Mouse Button 2 
      Combo Start: """" 
      Combo Select: """" 
      Combo Triangle: """" 
      Combo Circle: Mouse Button 3 
      Combo Cross: """" 
      Combo Square: """" 
      Combo Move: """" 
      Combo T: """"
    Player 2: 
      Start: """" 
      Select: """" 
      Triangle: Mouse Button 3 
      Circle: """" 
      Cross: Mouse Button 2 
      Square: """" 
      Move: """" 
      T: Mouse Button 1 
      Combo: Mouse Button 2 
      Combo Start: """" 
      Combo Select: """" 
      Combo Triangle: """" 
      Combo Circle: Mouse Button 3 
      Combo Cross: """" 
      Combo Square: """" 
      Combo Move: """" 
      Combo T: """"
    

EDITORS NOTES: Reddit is Dog shit when it comes to posting code blocks this pastepin has the config you need to copy and paste

EDITORS NOTES: After Snooping around the UI for a little longer I did eventually find where you can set these with a GUI by going to **Configuration → USB Devices → PS Move (mouse)** but the yml edit also works and its all set up for you to copy and paste.

# Frame Rate Configuration (59hz vs 60hz)

Look, I'll level with you—I can't tell the difference between 59 FPS and 60 FPS. You can stone me later. After many GPU tweaks and test I saw someones comment about how you need to cap the game at 59 FPS to stop major slow down and and droped inputs in TC4, so unless you want to play an objectively broken, janky version of Time Crisis 4, you need to set **Vblank** to **59hz** in the main config.

Unfortunately, RPCS3's UI only lets you drop Vblank down to 60hz at minimum. To get 59, you'll have to edit the config file directly:

1. Go to your RPCS3 install folder → `config/config.yml`
2. Open it with any text editor
3. Find the line for **Vblank** and set it to `59`
4. Set **Vblank NTSC Fixup** to `false`

Now this change is global, but in the grand scheme of the cold, desolate universe, I assure you no one is going to break into your house and give you a ticket for playing these titles in 59 FPS as opposed to 60 FPS. [Italy will probably arrest you](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/youtuber-faces-jail-time-for-showing-off-android-based-gaming-handhelds/) for emulation though.

# Calibration Screen Controls

Boot up the game and launch any of the three titles. You'll be greeted by the infamous **Calibration Screen of Death**. If you've followed everything up to this point, you should be able to get through it without much resistance—though maybe it's futile, pun aside.

# Player 1 Calibration

You'll be asked to calibrate **Player 1** first:

* Pull the trigger and line up your shots as usual you should see a crosshair if you check marked Show PS Move Cross Hairs in the I/O portion
* When prompted to confirm, press your **Mouse 3** button (this was configured in your `gem.mouse.yml` file—the physical location of this button depends on your gun model)

# Player 2 Calibration

Next, you'll be prompted to calibrate **Player 2**. You have two options:

* **Option 1:** Repeat the same calibration steps as Player 1, just with Player 2's gun you should then see a different color crosshair this is how you'll know if P1 and P2 are being see as independant mice. If youre seeing the same colored crosshiar no worries just go back to Raw Input Designation portion of the guide and find the correct HID device for Player 2
* **Option 2:** Skip calibration by pressing **Circle** which I Combo'd as **Mouse 2** \+ **Mouse 3** you can also press cirlce on you on your **Player 1 Controller** (the one set to `Keyboard`, `XInput`, or `SDL`)

# Save States By Pass

I’m not going to do a full walkthrough on save states here—RPCS3’s implementation is still experimental and tends to break with every update. That said, unless some groundbreaking change happens, I don’t expect you’ll be updating this particular light gun configuration often.

Still, the setup is flexible enough that if you want to live on the bleeding edge of PS3 emulation, you can update and re-do your save state. Just know that right now there are maybe three—at most five—light gun titles worth running in RPCS3. And, to everyone’s disappointment, The Shoot isn’t one of them.

* Press **Ctrl+S** to create a save state
* Press **Ctrl+L** to load it

# A few notes so you don't get tripped up:

* There's only one save slot per game right now, so **Ctrl+S** will overwrite the previous one
* Each game in the Razing Storm collection is its own executable. A TC4 state won't load in Deadstorm (and vice versa). Make one post-calibration state per game
* If you accidentally overwrite your state, my setup still lets you get past calibration consistently, so you're not bricked—just remake the state after calibrating again

# My Haphazard Navigation Controller Workaround

As much as id love to buy those drop dead gorgeous $1000+ on Gun4IR builds with real arcade Guncon shells, im a brokie, the RS3 Reapers are the next best thing. The catch? Their setup is both frustrating and kind of brilliant at the same time.

If you remember the Primer up top, I mentioned that your gun needs to send **Mouse 1–3** cleanly through a single Raw HID device path. Here's why: the Reapers don't actually do that. They've have two Raw HID devices—one for mouse movement, **Mouse 1** (trigger), **Mouse 2** (side button), and **Mouse 3** (under the clip). And then one for the joystick and 2 buttons up front.

So if you followed this guide with RS3 and set ""Keyboard"" as the Handler in the Pad Config under Player 1, you probably noticed the joystick just works. That's because the default ""D-pad"" is the arrow keys, which is conveniently already bound to a Player 1 Reaper. You could do this with a Sinden too I presume with its integrated D-pad but you might be out of luck with a Gun4IR unless it also has a joystick/D-pad and with a Aimtrack youre pretty much out of luck being the weakest of the 4 offerings in this department

# Disclaimers

This setup hasn’t been tested with the two PS Move RE titles (Darkside Chronicles and Umbrella Chronicles) outside of calibration—so your mileage may vary in game. That said, now that you understand how the mapping works under the hood, you can apply the same principles to get past their calibration screens. You may need to tinker with combo mouse inputs a bit more. For example, I was able to calibrate by swapping Mouse 3 to “Start” instead of ""Triangle"" in the gem.mouse.yml, since those games require Start on the PS Move controller to begin calibration, then Circle **Mouse 2**\+**Mouse 3** once you’re finished.

And thats pretty much it, I don't know if any of this had already been writen down somehwere and I never found it but I figured I post this here as reddit was the first place I looked for a solution on this upon geting my first pair of lightguns about 2 weeks ago now.

Should I go lower on my deficit? Up my cardio? I don’t want to lose too much muscle but maybe I don’t burn as much as I think I do.

How do I set boundaries so this doesn't happen again? (25F, 24M)","My boyfriend of three years Tom (24M) and I (25F) booked a trip to France back in January and have been looking forward to it ever since. Last month, his mom (54) asked what hotel we were staying at. I sent her the link, saying “save it for your future trip!” She immediately replies: “Booked for the **same dates**”

Excuse me, WHAT??? I ask Tom wtf this is about and he tells me it seems like they booked the trip a few days ago, so it’s nonrefundable at this point for them, and he doesn’t want to argue with his family. Sigh.

Fast forward to the trip: his whole family is there. Same hotel. Instead of enjoying the vacation I’d planned, we spent it waiting around and eating at mid places because of their dietary restrictions. When Tom and I grabbed coffee alone one morning, his mom texted, “You went without us?”

I asked Tom to set boundaries, but he thought it would be better to talk to them after the trip. He was also sick the first half, so I gave him space. By the end, we were stressed and snapping at each other. At the last dinner, his mom said, “Let’s all go to Portugal next summer!” We exchanged a glance and changed the subject.

This was supposed to be our European vacation together. Instead, it turned into a family vacation. I’m furious and honestly anxious about future vacations.
What would be the best way for Tom to set boundaries? Should he be blunt (“we want to travel alone next time” or even “you guys hijacked our trip”) or softer (“you came with us last time, so this one is just us”)?

We rarely argue, and I love him, but I cannot go through another trip like this. MY MAIN QUESTION is whether to be blunt/let his family feel bad that they ruined our vacation OR let them know gently so we don’t rock the boat and cause future problems?

*Edit: I had to repost as I didn’t realize I had to add we have been together three years. Also, my bf and I are happy together, just want some advice on navigating his overbearing/clueless mom.

TLDR; My boyfriend’s mom invited herself (and the family) on our first international trip, stayed at our hotel, and attached themselves to us most of the time. The trip was miserable, and I don’t want this to happen again. How can my boyfriend set boundaries with his family about future vacations?",26,1756346407.0,relationships,44,0.91,False

1n1zwh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n1zwh7/we_went_searching_for_ghosts_but_found_something/,"We went searching for ghosts, but found something much worse","My fascination with ghosts and the paranormal began 2 years ago. It was a cool summer night, and it was beginning to rain. Me and my friends, Dan and Todd, were walking back home from a ‘night on the town’, which isn't saying much as we live in a small town with a population of 1,400 people.



We were walking down \[Redacted\] street, despite Dan's protest. He hated taking this path home because of the decaying school that sat dormant on this street. Rumor around town was that the school is haunted. People say they have heard screaming and wailing from the school at night, but Todd says it's all bullshit.



It's a large modern brick building standing 2 floors tall and takes up the entire block. It was once a nice up-to-date school, but it closed down a couple years prior due to a dwindling student population. A year later it was bought by an old mechanic in town, and he intended to renovate it into a hotel, but the city said the school was on the verge of being condemned due to the west wing's second floor being on the verge of collapse. So now it sits nearly empty, the mechanic Charlie lives alone in the school and works out of the old auto shop room, so his investment wouldn’t be a complete waste. Charlie denies the claims of the school being haunted.



As we walked closer to the school Dan and Todd were arguing about how ‘haunted’ the school was.



“I just don’t see why we couldn’t take a different route home”  Dan said “this area gives me the heebie jeebies” 



“This is the fastest route home, and I'm not trying to get caught in the rain” Todd replied “It's just a bunch of small town gossip is all, this town has nothing else going on so they make things up to stay interesting” 



“I went here when I was a kid,” I added. “There's nothing scary about it. The closest occurrence we had was me almost dying of boredom a couple times.” 



“Yeah yeah very funny” Dan sighed “My dad says he refuses to step foot on this street after what he heard one night”



“Okay, but your dad is also a drunk, so who knows what he actually heard.” said Todd. 



As Dan and Todd continued bickering about how scary the school was, I heard a faint tapping sound coming from nearby. I stopped dead in my tracks, it sounded like a hand tapping on glass. 



“Guys shut up for a sec” I said “Do you hear that?”  



They slowed to a stop, and I realized the sound was coming from the direction of the school. The tapping sound became louder as if someone was beating on a window. I didn’t see anything at first, but as I looked closer into the school I saw the outline of a girl in one of the lower windows. 



“There! In-in the West Wing! Theres a- there's a girl in the window on the bottom floor!” I stammered as I grabbed my phone from my pocket. 



“Which window?” Todd asked “there's a lot of windows dude” 



“Oh Shit, there! I see her!” Dan yelled



I opened the camera on my phone to try record a video, but before I could I heard a piercing scream and I dropped my phone. 



I bent down and picked my phone up off the ground, when I looked back up she was gone. 



“Where'd she go?!” I asked frantically



“She dropped below the window” Dan responded “I don't see her anymore!” 



I continued looking around but Dan was right, she was gone. 



“Dammit” I exclaimed “I should have got that on video!” 



“I didn’t see anything” Todd stated “are you sure you saw a girl? That screech could have been anything.” 



“Yes dude, I'm sure! That was the scariest moment of my life. Now I'm ready to get the hell out of here, let’s go” Dan said, while picking up the pace back towards home. 



“Wait, shouldn't we find out what the hell that was?” I asked 



“How? Its private property?” Asked Todd “if you want to call the cops and tell them you saw a ghost girl in the school you can go right ahead, but I'm going to join Dan and get out of here, it's starting to rain” As he turned to catch up with Dan.



I cursed under my breath again, upset that I messed up what would have been the best ghost evidence on the internet. I took one more look at the school before turning around to join my friends. 

  


That moment sparked my inspiration to start a youtube channel, so Todd, Dan, and I launched a channel a few months after. We have been on a dozen ghost hunts by now, with little to no evidence to show for it, but we have amassed 60k subscribers. 

  


The closest thing we have to evidence is a door closing on its own during our investigation of an abandoned mall. Todd is adamant that it was a draft, but Dan argues it was definitely something paranormal and that Todd is ignorant. Other than that though, all we have caught are some loud creaks and bangs while investigating abandoned houses, which I realize can easily be brushed off as nothing.



I am certain that our big break would be if we could investigate the school. Ever since word of our channel got around town, people have told me many stories regarding that building, and they insist that’s what we should investigate next. I've already tried asking the owner Charlie if I could, he said he would if he could but his insurance doesn’t want anyone else going in that building and that they are already opposed to him living there as is. So for now I have just been recording the neighborhoods stories to hopefully make into a video later. 

  


I woke up this morning to my phone ringing. I rolled over disgruntledly to see Todd calling.



“What do you want?” I answered a bit harshly. 



“Well good morning to you too, Sunshine” Todd responded



“Well excuse me, It is 8am on a Saturday, what is so important that it couldn't have been a text?” I asked 



“Well, I call with good news” Todd said 



“Okay, well, what is it then” I replied curiously



“Charlie died” Todd stated a bit too excitedly 



I paused before asking “How is this good news Todd?” 



“Well it's not, but it's good for us at least. Because this means we can finally investigate the school,” he replied.



I took a moment, thinking it over, unsure what to say. I had only woken up moments ago, and now I'm being told Charlie is dead and that we should investigate his school. 



Todd added “Abby just told me. His body is going to the coroner's office this morning. An officer found his car wrapped around a tree, they suspect it happened last night.” 



Todd's wife Abby works for the city, so of course she has the inside scoop.



“There’s a slight hitch though,” Todd added. 



“What's that?” I asked 



“Well Abby tried to notify the next of kin, but all that he had listed was some guy down south. She told him the news, and he told her that he would be coming up in a couple days and that he is going to buy the school when he gets there.” Todd said. 



“That's odd” I added “he has quite the list of priorities I guess. What would he want with a condemned school anyways?”  



“I was wondering the same thing” Todd said “but regardless that means we would have to investigate it soon, before the buyer gets into town.” 



Todd was right, we could investigate the school now that Charlie is dead. It probably isn’t very considerate but it's a possibility nonetheless, and we wouldn't get another possibility like this again. 



“Okay, I’ll tell Dan,” I said finally “we will investigate the school tonight” 

  


It was well after dark as we approached the school. It's even more ominous when we are this close, especially when it is bathed in the night. The building looks weathered yet surprisingly current, and besides for the paint flaking and fading away, it looks just as I remember it from when I was a student. We crossed the empty parking lot and as we got to the front doors Todd spoke first. 



“Sooo do we just walk in through the front door, or did anyone make a plan for how we get inside?” He asked 



I looked over to Dan and he gave me a small shrug as a response. 



I responded “I guess I didn't consider that part. I put too much thought into whether or not we should and didn’t think about if we even could.” 



Dan let out a light chuckle saying “I was more worried about if it's more or less illegal to break into a man's house after he is dead. Is it still breaking and entering if he is dead, or is this just trespassing?” 



“I'm no lawyer, and I'm barely a ghost hunter, but from a legal standpoint, i'm gonna say maybe” I joked



“Well he did say he would be okay with it if it weren't for his insurance” Todd replied “who would we sue now if we got hurt?”



“Okay, that's a reasonable point I suppose” I said trying to make myself feel better about this potential crime “but we better figure out a way inside here soon, I don’t want any cops to see us. Anyone have any ideas?” 



Todd bent over and grabbed a large rock. 



“No, put that down dude” Dan said in a hushed shout “That would definitely be breaking and entering” 



“Well, do you have a better idea?” Todd asked



As Todd and Dan squabble about the most acceptable way to break into the school, I approached the front doors. I put my hands on the doors and gave it a little push, and to our surprise they actually opened. 



“He left them unlocked?” Asked Dan



“I guess” I responded “it is a small town after all, maybe he didn't plan to be out for long.” 



Todd and Dan entered the building behind me. The doors closed behind us and we could hear the sound echo throughout the vast building. We turned on our shoulder lights, the school still has power running to it, but we don’t want any neighbors to see the lights on.



The school has an odd aesthetic to it since it is now redesigned to be a home. We stood in the entryway which is a large open hallway now designed as a very open living room. There were a few display cases along the nearest wall that now holds Charlie's shoes and coats. The room has a few couches and an older TV, neither of them seemed to be used in a while. 



“You guys ready?” I asked as I pulled out the camera. 



“Yes, but please don't do your regular intro for our video” Todd pleaded



“Why not? I've done it for every video” I asked



“Dude, it's annoyingly stereotypical. If this video does blow up our channel like you say it will, we can't have that type of introduction for the new viewers” Todd stated



“Okay well do you want to do the introduction then?” I asked him. 



“Well no, that'd be even worse” he said



“Okay then. I’ll do the introduction my way then.” I stated



I turned the camera around to face me and hit record. “Good evening our Dubious Ghost Viewers, we are back again with another investigative video! Tonight we are investigating my local school. This building is a bit of a local legend. There are so many terrifying stories about this location, so we just had to investigate it. So get ready to start believing in the paranormal, but before you do, don’t forget to like and subscribe.” 



I hit pause on the camera, and it  was followed by a deafening silence in the room. I could see Todd and Dan holding back laughter. 



“I agree with Todd, that shit sounds pathetic dude” Dan laughed finally



“Yeah I know” I said “It always does.” 



“That one hurt,” Todd chuckled while shaking his head. “Can we go explore now with that out of the way?” 



“Yes please” I said dejectedly 



To the right of the now living room is the gymnasium, and to the left is the swimming pool, we elected to explore the gymnasium first. 



The gymnasium didn’t appear to be altered at all, it also didn’t appear to have been used lately, the bleachers are dusty and the floor looks as if it hadn’t been swept in at least a year. 



I pulled out my camera to record some footage while we performed our tests. Our investigation usually starts with an ouija board, most ghost hunters claim this is complete BS, and honestly we agree, but it does provide some good content. We didn't get much if any movement from the board this time, besides for Todd trying to spell out P-E-N-I-S a couple times. The next test we like to try is the spirit box, Todd absolutely hates this device, and I can see why, but Dan is convinced it is legit. We let the spirit box run for a while. Dan said he heard some related words, but I think he was really stretching his imagination, because all I heard was incoherent nonsense. I usually check an EMF reader while we investigate, but it was very unreliable tonight due to the building actually having power for once. And speaking of power, the air conditioner scared the hell out of us a couple times during the testing. We are used to it being dead silent and we fine tune our ears to pick up any noises, so when the AC roared to life we all jumped.



Once we agreed we weren’t getting any evidence in this area we walked across the hall to the swimming pool. The room is humid and smells like chlorine despite the 12 foot pool being drained. The hot tub had a couple renovations from the last time I had seen it, there is now a TV mounted nearby and a new minifridge sitting adjacent. We ran a few tests in this room as well, with no proof yet again. 



We wandered over to the locker rooms which are just outside of the swimming area. We entered the men's room, and it appeared to be well used. I assume this was Charlie's main bathing area based off of the fresh towels sitting in the lockers and dirty laundry sitting in a hamper in the corner. The sink has a couple of new drawers built on to it, with his toiletries sitting on top. We didn’t stay in here for long or record any video, as it felt invasive even though he was gone. 



I stepped back into the hall and took an awkward glance into the women's locker room. 



“Hey bud, what ya looking at?” Dan asked, ""Is this how I find out you are a pervert?”



“I'm just curious, haven’t you wondered what a women's locker room is like?” I asked 



“Sure, but it’s probably the same as the men's just without the urinals, and maybe different paint” Todd stated



“Okay well don't you guys wanna find out, now is our chance” I said 



“Sure I suppose, why not?  Let's go peep in the girls bathroom” Todd said while walking in. 



When we entered the locker room we were surprised and speechless from what we saw. The women's room also appears to be well used, but by girls, which was concerning because Charlie didn't have a wife nor kids. The lockers contained towels and girls' clothing, ranging from children's size to adult. The doors on the stalls were removed. 



Todd broke the silence by saying “What- the- fuck. Are you guys disturbed by this as well” 



“This is definitely concerning, this doesn't make any sense” I replied



“Why would Charlie have girls' clothes here, and why so much? It’s just him that lives here.” Todd asked 



Before I had a chance to reply Dan shushed us. His eyes wide with fear, and stammered “I think I just heard someone knocking” 



“As in? Knocking how” Todd asked still focused on the locker room



“Like when you knock on somebody's front door politely waiting to be let inside” Dan said 



“Could it have been old pipes maybe?” Todd asked still looking around the locker room



“No, it definitely sounded like a hand knocking on a door. As in knock knock, who's there” Dan said “I'm telling you guys-”



Knock,Knock,Knock



He was interrupted by the knocking, it must have been louder this time as Todd and I both heard it clearly. Dan was right it definitely sounded like someone knocking on a door, even Todd looked like he agreed. 



I turned my camera on and we stepped back into the hall. 



I asked “is it coming from the front door? Did someone find out we are here?” 



“Maybe,” Dan said “it's so hard to tell, the building echoes so much” 



I started cautiously walking to the front door when we heard it again. 



Knock,Knock,Knock



“That sounded like it came from down the hall” Todd stated 



“That leads deeper into the school, that's the hall that brings you to either the West or East wings” I said



“Well I don't like that,” Dan said as the three of us began walking down the hall. 



The hall felt as if it was a mile long, and it felt like I was running one based on how hard my heart was beating. I'm excited that this will be the first bit of actual evidence we have ever gotten, but I am also terrified.



 We finally got to the end of the hall, there are two sets of double doors on either side of the hall. The right set of doors are open, they lead into the East wing which is the high school, assumedly where Charlie used to live. The left doors are chained shut, they lead into the west wing which is the elementary school, that is the condemned wing so that's probably why they are chained shut. 



“Which way do you think it came from” Todd asked



We got our answer as we heard another Knock,Knock,Knock to the left and I saw the west wing doors shake and bind against the chains. 



I slowly approached the doors and asked “Hello, who is it?” with false confidence.



In response we heard a quick pattering fleeing from the door, like little footsteps running away in a game of tag.



We sat in silence for a moment, my confidence quickly fading.  



Dan pushed on the doors and said “we have to get into the west wing, there is clearly something back there. Do you think Charlie left a key somewhere” while he pulled on the lock.



“Maybe” I replied “but actually the East and West wings share a lunch room, so the two sides meet up again at the cafeteria, maybe those doors are less secure and easier to break into.” 



“Well let's take a trip through the east wing then” Todd said “before that critter gets away.”



We all shared a look of agreement, and headed through the high school doors.

  


The high school side appears to be more taken care of, the carpet looks recently vacuumed and the walls have been repainted. We walk through the vacant halls, passing by empty class rooms. I recorded some more with the camera, while Dan and Todd were bickering yet again.



Dan said “there is no way you actually think that was an animal back there” 



“It had to be” Todd responded “what else could it be? A ghost? A ghoul? Some sort of monster maybe?” 



“We are GHOST hunting, so yes I do think it could be a ghost. That is the whole reason we are out here, that's what we are trying to find” Dan stated



Todd stayed quiet, probably because Dan has a pretty good point.



“What kind of animal do you think it was then?” Dan asked half jokingly 



“I don't know, that's why we are going over there. It has to be something pretty big though.” Todd said unconvincingly



“Oh come on dude, seriously? Do you hear yourself right now” Dan asked



We passed by the auto shop, it lay empty which seems odd to me. The shop hasn’t changed much, besides for the addition of Charlie's tools. The room is fairly dusty, but it's hard to tell if that's out of the ordinary for auto shops. The attached classroom is renovated into an office space. A newer computer sits atop his desk with a few file cabinets sitting along the nearby wall. We searched the office for his keys, but we found nothing, so we kept heading for the cafeteria.  



I led us through the next corridor, and through a shortcut through the library. It has been remodeled into an oversized living room area. A couple couches and a reclining chair sat around a large TV with a nice sound system. A couple of the bookshelves now hold an extensive collection of movies and CDs. We planned to come back to this room and investigate it further after we checked out the west wing. 

  


We took a quick detour to explore the principals’ office which is now Charlie's bedroom. The layout reminds me of a small apartment, there's a waiting room when you first walk in, which connects to Charlie's bedroom and main bathroom. It is well decorated, the waiting area has a couple plants sitting in the corners of the room and the walls are arranged with posters of old metal bands I don't recognize. His bedroom is also well kept, the bed is made and his nightstand seems organized. We searched this area as well, but did not have any more luck finding the keys. I was beginning to worry that he may have had the keys on him the night he died, but I tried to push that thought away as we continued our expedition to the cafeteria. 

  


We finally arrived at the cafeteria, it is a spacious room lined with rows of long tables. I looked closer at the tables and saw something that troubled me. There are about a dozen lunch trays loaded with food sitting on a couple of the tables. The food looks to be only a day or two old. I point it out to the guys, and Todd seems equally troubled by it. We were confused about why Charlie would need so many trays for himself, but Dan walked by us clearly more interested in the doors that connect to the West Wing, expressing a bravery we haven’t seen from him before. He stepped up to the doors and gave them a push, they are locked, so he took a couple steps back and before either Todd or I can protest he kicks the doors open. 



We caught up to Dan and I said “Y’know a heads up would have been nice”



Dan replied “Well we couldn't find the keys and I don’t know of any other ways in, so how else were we going to get into the elementary school?”



Todd said “I don't know dude, you didn't really give us any time to weigh our options.” 



“Okay well it's too late now, so why are we wasting time debating how to get through the doors when I've already kicked them down.” Dan asked smugly 



“Okay fair enough, you make a good point. Let's go then.” Todd said, leading the way into the elementary school. 



Before following them, I record a quick extra bit of footage of the cafeteria, still troubled by the lunch trays. Eventually I turn back towards my friends, hurriedly closing the gap into the West Wing. 

  


The West Wing is more neglected, but still holds the appearance of an elementary school. Most of the rooms still have the old desks and classroom decor, but are covered in a heavy layer of dust. This side of the school smells musty and stale. All of the windows on this side are boarded up. The walls are painted pastel colors and the floors have colored lines which lead to different portions of the school. We saw no obvious signs of what was knocking on the door earlier, so we decided we should walk back to the first set of doors, in hopes that we might find something closer to where the knocking first occurred. 



As we got deeper into the elementary school, I noticed something. The West Wing is in very nice condition, it looks clearly abandoned, but it didn't appear to be on the verge of collapse like Charlie said it was. I mentioned it to the guys. 



“Hey, does this wing look very condemned to you two?” I asked 



They paused to look around, 



Todd said ""I'm no building inspector, but I would agree, this wing does look pretty nice so far, I wouldn't condemn it.” 



Dan commented “I thought Charlie said it was the second floor that was dangerous, we haven't made it up there yet.” 



“I guess” I said “but I assumed there would be damage on the first floor as well, if the second floor was about to collapse.”  



They just shrugged and continued exploring.  

  


As we traipsed past the computer lab, Dan stopped us silently raising a hand. 



“What's up? Why are you acting all black ops right now?” Todd whispered



“Do you hear that?” Dan asked “do you hear that humming?” 



We fell silent and I heard it. It's a sing-songy type of humming coming from within the computer lab. We exchange nervous glances, and I lead the way slowly prowling into the room. The lab has numerous computers lining every wall and a couple rows down the middle. I can hear the humming clearer now that we are inside, but I can't quite make out the song. We can’t see the source of the humming right away, so we split up to get a better look.



I slowly approach one of the middle rows. I apprehensively looked under the desks, and I discover what is singing. A young girl is crouched under the desk on the far end. She's wearing a dirty stained nightgown and her hair is matted. She is rocking back and forth slowly, and I can now hear her whimpering “they need help” as she hums. I froze, unsure how to proceed. She must have felt my eyes on her because she quit humming and sits still. Slowly she turns her head to look at me. She looks me dead in the eyes unblinking, and lets out an ear piercing raspy shriek. I jump back terrified and she leaps at me. I narrowly avoid her, but I somehow manage to drop the camera as she runs by me and towards the door. 



She ran into the hall screaming, “YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE!” and “GET OUT!” 



I look back at the guys, they both sit petrified. 



“Guys! Snap out of it, we gotta follow her” I yell while picking up my camera off the floor. Thankfully it still works. Dan rushed to my side and we ran into the hall in the direction the girl fled.



We rounded the corner at the end of the corridor and see the girl standing completely still with her hand pointing towards the stairs. I stop and pull out my camera, recording clear footage of the girl. 



She whispers “they are up there, please help us.” 



Dan said “fuck this dude, im out. We got our footage, that's enough for me.” and turns around racing towards the nearest exit.



“Dan! Wait!” I yell pleading 



I turn back towards the girl, but she’s gone. Nervously I look around for her, I see fresh footprints in the dust that lead upstairs, but I'm not about to go up there alone.



“Yeah fuck this” I agree and run back the same way as Dan. 



I found Dan and Todd back in the computer lab. Todd shook out of his horror, but he was still spooked. I approached him saying “It's time to go buddy. I got our footage, let's leave”. Dan nodded in anxious agreement, leading us out the door.



We quickly retrace our steps back to the cafeteria. I am a bit concerned about Todd, I've never seen him this quiet before, but Dan is able to escort him out ahead of me. 

  


We made it back to the cafeteria without event. I turned back momentarily to close the doors behind us, then we paused briefly to catch our breath. 



“What the hell was that?” Dan asked, still rattled.



“I think that was our first ghost,” I said excitedly.



“Once we get out of here I can't wait to say I told you so” Dan said playfully pushing Todd



Todd laughed anxiously “yeah, I guess you guys are right. I think that was actually a ghost. Did you get it on camera?” 



“Oh yeah I did. This video is gonna blow us up. The footage I got is perfect, I’d dare to say the best evidence on the entire internet” I responded



“You guys ready to go home so we can get that footage posted then?” Dan asked 



“Yes I am very ready to get the hell out of here” Todd said.

  


We headed back the way we came, following our footsteps through the highschool, through the once home of old Charlie. I still have a lot of questions after this expedition, but for now I'm focusing on getting home. 

  


We made it through the high school easily, and got back to the hallway that divides the west and east wings. I let out a sigh of relief as I saw the entryway doors at the end of the hall. I took a moment near the West doors to look at the chains, when the door slowly creaked open and rattled as it bound against the chains. A face now peering at us through the gap. As soon as I locked eyes with her, the doors began to violently shake, and I heard a girl's voice yelling and crying.



“LET US OUT, PLEASE. Please, you have to set us free. Help us.”



She started pounding heavily on the door and continued pleading, but we already began running in the opposite direction. 



We barged through the entry way doors, and I was half tempted to kiss the ground as I stepped foot on the parking lot. I looked around at my friends, their faces mixed with emotions partially excited but also terrified. We recorded a quick outro outside of the school, I'm unsure if it will be usable since we are so clearly shaken up. Dan gave a couple middle fingers to the old school, but Todd and I didn't look back. Finally I put the camera away and we got into my car, relieved to be heading home, and ready to post the video of what we found. 



It didn't take long for the video to blow up like we suspected. I spent the entire next day editing the video so I could post it as soon as possible. I was able to post it on Sunday night, just a day after our investigation. By Thursday the video was on the trending tab with a million views. Our channel blew up, gaining a half of a million subscribers already and didn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. We received a dozen DMs from other creators asking to collab or to ask us for the location of the school. But one DM stuck out in particular, it was from an individual named Josh. He was insistent on getting information about the girl we saw. 

  


Josh: Hey guys, my name is Josh \[Redacted\]. I just saw your video and I know this may sound odd, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the girl. Its urgent 



His message made me curious so I agreed. “Sure, what do you want to know about her?” 



Josh: Did you happen to see her eyes? If so, what color were they?



“I didn't really get a good look at them, it was too dark in there”



Josh: How about her right forearm? Did you see a scar shaped like a dog bite on her arm? 



I didn't remember much about her arm, so I looked back at the footage. I start by rewatching when she leapt at me in the computer lab. That's when I noticed something. I didn't drop the camera, she knocked it out of my hands when she jumped at me. I could clearly see her hand hitting the camera, and it was the same arm Josh asked about. I took a closer look at her arm and saw she did indeed have a dog bite shaped scar.



I sent another message to Josh, “Yes she does have a scar on her arm. How did you know that?” 



Josh: I thought that was her. Please, you need to tell me the location of the school. I can meet you somewhere if you don't trust me.” 



“I'm not telling you anything more until you tell me how you knew about her scar” 



Josh: Okay fine. I know about her scar because I think the girl you saw in the school is my missing sister.



There is a photo attached to the message. I opened it and saw a missing person poster, the girl on the poster looks exactly like the girl I saw in the school that night. Her name is Lucy \[Redacted\] and she went missing nine months ago from a nearby county. 



I replied to Josh immediately with my phone number and gave him the location of the school. He told me he doesn't live too far from here, and we agreed to meet at my apartment tonight and then go to the police with our findings. 

  


I stand outside the school once again with Josh, Todd, and Dan; but this time the school is bathed in flashing red and blue lights as the sun is setting behind it. The school is surrounded by what appears to be every police officer and EMT in town. The officers breached the school just moments ago and we were told to wait in the parking lot. 



Josh made it into town earlier this evening. As soon as he came into my apartment I knew he was telling the truth, I could see it in his eyes, they looked just like Lucy's. We skipped all formalities as he told me all the details of her disappearance. After I answered all of Josh's questions we went to the police station. 

 

We told the story to the officer at the front desk. Officer Andersen didn’t seem to be convinced with our ghost girl in the school story, until I showed him the video and Josh pulled out the missing persons poster. Andersen put on his glasses to get a closer look at the girl, and saw that we were serious. He showed our proof to some of the nearby officers, they unanimously agreed to start an investigation. 



Then a couple hours later we arrived here. We weren't technically invited to join the investigation, but no one stopped us either.  



We sat in the parking lot for what felt like the entire night, but according to my watch it has been only 45 minutes. The sun has fully set by now and the night sky is beginning to take over. 

  


Finally the front doors opened, one of the officers exited the building with his arm around Lucy. Josh ran up to her as fast as he could without frightening her. Lucy watched him tensely until she recognized him, then she smiled and fell into his arms. He said something to her but I was out of earshot and I didn't want to intrude. 



The front doors opened again and two more officers walked out, holding a couple of young girls in their arms. The girls are gauntly thin, they look sickly but are alive nonetheless. The officers rushed them over to the ambulance. Todd pointed me to the front doors again and I saw three more officers rush out with girls in their arms as well.



I overheard the two officers talking to the EMTs “there are a couple more girls inside yet, Andersen is working on getting them free right now. One teen and one adult. These girls were chained upstairs in the elementary art room.” 



The other officer pointed to Lucy and said “that girl gave us quite the scare in there, she was the only girl not chained up. She said she escaped her chains last week and hit a ‘bad man’ with a brick, but she hasn’t seen him since.”



The three other officers approached the ambulances, setting the girls on the available gurneys, and asked how they could help. An officer named Lincoln turned to us and told us he is going to take Lucy back to the station to treat her there, and see what else she is willing to tell us tonight. Josh and I agreed to come with. 

  


By morning a lot of my questions became answered.  Lucy was very open about her experiences in the school. She was very brave, with encouragement from her big brother Josh. She started by telling us that she tried to hurt Charlie with a brick because he was a bad man, but she couldn’t hit him hard enough and he dragged her back upstairs. That was the night that Charlie got into a car accident, Lincoln is going to look further into the autopsy but suspects Lucy gave him a concussion and that caused him to veer off the road as he was driving to the hospital. Eventually Lucy was able to escape her chains again, but couldn’t escape the West Wing since the doors were locked and the windows are boarded up. I felt pretty bad for closing the doors behind me as we fled that night. 



She also told us that Charlie has been kidnapping the girls from nearby towns. Lincoln pointed out that most of the girls rescued from the school are in the missing persons databases of neighboring counties. He showed the database to Lucy and she was able to point out a few more girls that used to be at the school but were picked up by another ‘bad man’. She said he comes from the south to pick up the girls who don’t behave. I told Lincoln about the man who was listed as Charlie's ‘next of kin’ that Todd mentioned last week. Lincoln pulled up the man's information and found his photo. He showed the photo to Lucy, she cried but confirmed it was him. His name is Arnold \[Redacted\], and he even looked like a creep. He should have made it into town by now according to my conversation with Todd. Lincoln had his doubts that he would show at all, but said they would keep trying to reach him until he is caught. 



Later when the IT department went through the computer in Charlie's office and they validated what Lucy said. They found hundreds of messages between Charlie and Arnold that revealed a bigger trafficking ring led by Arnold. At that point they turned the case over to the FBI for a large-scale operation.  



That was the last of officer Lincoln's questioning. Then the on-site nurse gave Lucy a quick evaluation. Lucy said she felt fine, so the nurse told her to get plenty of rest over the next few days and drink plenty of water. Lucy asked about the other girls in the school; the nurse said they are all going to be okay and that the officers are reaching out to their parents now.



Finally Lincoln said we are free to leave, but we have to stay in town until the investigation is complete. I extended an offer to Josh and Lucy to stay at my place for a few days, which they accepted. We left the department grateful for all they have done, but hopeful we wouldn't have to return any time soon.



We arrived at my apartment before noon. Before I could even offer my bedroom to Lucy she was asleep on the couch. Josh fell asleep on the recliner adjacent to her, unwilling to leave her side. I left two glasses of water on the coffee table with a note telling them to help themselves to anything in the kitchen. I walked into my bedroom and turned on my computer. Officer Lincoln told me to delete the video of the school for the remainder of the investigation. I wasn’t sure how long that would be, so I began writing my experiences here while the memories and emotions are still fresh. Surprisingly my Youtube channel no longer feels as important. I have new friends to care for now, along with my old ones. Maybe a break from ghost hunting will do me good, because I certainly found more than I was hoping to. 



So that’s all for now Dubious Ghost Viewers, until next time. Thank you…

\---Director---

  

\---Jemma’s perspective---

I look across my desk to where a stocky, scarlet haired Neanderthal stands, agitatedly fidgeting.

“Stop it, Kor.”

“Stop what?” he asks blankly.

“Stop *seething*.” I clarify.

“I’m **not** *seething*!” he seethes.

“Yes you *are*, my heart. You’re seething because today is the day she arrives and you still think it should have been *me*.” I point out.

“It **should** have been you!” growls my former captain-turned husband-turned subordinate.

“If it should have been me, it *would* have been, my heart.” I state, calmly.

“You’ve been on this planet for 12 years! You’ve been working for the ODR for 23! You’re fluent in the language **and** you’ve been running things here yourself since Jahnavi and Matthew **left**! **No** one is more qualified than you!”

“*Kor*…” I plead, gently “…this woman has nearly 200 years on me, she’s a prominent member of the entire species hegemonic Clan, a major figure in local politics, a moderately well known one on the *galactic* stage and, by *all* accounts, an *incomparably* competent administrative mind! If we’re talking *credentials*, she’s got me well and *truly* **beat**(!)”

“A major figure in politics who has consistently aligned herself **against** *us* and **with** our *enemies*! I don’t know **what** kind of political *shenanigans* took place for her to have been offered this job but I do know I **don**’**t** *like* it!” snarls the love of my life.

I stand up and round the desk between us, my cork wedge sandals doubling our height difference.

I look down into the Frenchman’s gorgeous green eyes as I place my right hand on his left shoulder and open my left at the level of his chest to say “My *heart*… the War is *over*… we *have* no ‘enemies’ anymore… Opponents? *Sure*! It would have been an **utter** *betrayal* of **all** we fought to *prove* to forbid any from *contradiction* or *opposition* to us in our Victory!… Our *enemies*, however, are *gone*!… They disappeared the moment the Peace was signed… The antiTerrans are simply trying to navigate a post-Peace galaxy the same as us… even *if* we often find their means of doing so *exasperating*!”

“I will always be a warrior, Jemma. That’s not something I can change.” he answers, as serious as a *pope*(!)

“And I’m *not* asking you to, my heart! The warrior is the man I fell in *love* with! Though any warrior must know when to fight and when not to fight. This is one of the latter. I want you to be as kind and professional with this woman as if you had no idea of her political past and as if you *didn*’*t* feel I had been unfairly snubbed on her account!”

Kor doesn’t answer,  just frowning up at me as I pull him into an embrace.

Holding his stout body close to me, feeling his idle power in a way which still makes my heart race like the first time we embraced back in bootcamp on the banks of the Garonne, I smile “Our Representative *personally* proposed her candidature, Kor… *and* she was approved by the ODRs on Citadel and Earth… Rain’s not stupid and neither are the UTCIS. There’s no way they did so on a whim and there’s no way they did so without knowing her past. Whatever happened on Citadel with these new species, she *must* have favourably impressed them… and do you think she would have agreed to take the job if the image you have of her was still typical of who she is?”

“It… could be some sort of two sided *ploy*? She’s agreed to take the job because she has some scheme in mind for how to abuse it and Rain agreed to give it to her because he has some trap he plans to catch her in…” the beautiful Frenchman suggests, churlishly.

“In *that* case, my heart, the best thing we can do is *exactly* what Rain expects of us, *isn*’*t* it?” I smile, resting my flat forehead on top of his sloped one “Conduct ourselves with incorruptible professionalism; failing to give her any ammunition to use against us while documenting and reporting any misconduct on her part through the proper channels. Am I *right*, my heart(?)” I grin.

The 56 year old man’s face subtly (and adorably) twists up in a way reminiscent of an uncomfortable toddler.

“And, if we *keep* making reports and nothing happens about them?” he poses.

I shrug “Then we put in a transfer request to somewhere else… Perhaps we could go back to Bordeaux and relive our *student* days(!)… I could even get my cycle unpaused and we could finally start that *family* we’ve always talked about…?”

The serious man’s lips break into a subtle smile as he mutters “*Suddenly*, *I*’*m hoping for her to be completely insufferable and for the ODR to do* nothing *about it*(!)”

I chuckle back “\*héhéhéhé\* *I* bet *you are*, *my heart*(!)” as I put my hand on the top back of his head and, using his elongated cranium as a lever arm to incline his face upwards, bring my lips to his to indulge us both in a loving kiss.

His thick arms wrap around the small of my back, squeezing me close to him.

At that exact moment, I hear the quiet \*woosh\* of my office door opening.

My husband’s entire body tenses in discomfort.

I sigh and turn my face to the door.

Standing there, staring at my husband and I with an expression that does not display the slightest *hint* of embarrassment regarding the intimacy he just interrupted, is a 120cm boy, covered in a rainbow of feathers.

Eight talons rest against the polished stone floor, six in front and two behind his avian feet.

Two red eyes are mounted on the sides of his head with two, more forward facing, black ones over his curved beak.

On top of his head is a headdress of moveable feathers that are currently flattened to his skull in deference.

His wings are politely folded at his sides, his supinated wingclaws giving a false impression of nervousness to the Terran eye.

I call him a ‘boy’ but, in reality, he’s substantially *older* than either my husband or I.

That’s just a bit of the local matriarchalism creeping into my thoughts(!)

Most male R’qali prefer the cuter reference ‘boy’ and, if you call them a ‘man’, they’re quite likely to ask what they’ve done to *upset* you(!)

“Yes, Qarca?” I ask, neutrally, switching from my husband’s first language into R’qali (my lack of a syrinx meaning that, though otherwise perfect, I speak it with quite a pronounced Human accent as I always will), *restraining* my frustration at him for the interruption.

“I thought you ought to know her shuttle touched down \[3 minutes\] ago at Karatrataq shuttleport. She will be arriving any moment now.” the boy relates, amiably.

“*Ah*! Thank you for letting us know… We’ll come right down.” I say, releasing Kor from the embrace and turning to the door.

Qarca wheels around and, just as I emerge onto the railless walkway on the inside of the stepped, horseshoe shaped building, pointed toward the gigantic spire of rock with in the middle of the city, launches himself from the side and glides down over the lower level walkways beneath us.

“*Aaaaalways* a little *jealous* when they do that(!)” I quip to my husband, switching back to French.

“*I*’*m* not.” frowns the acrophobe, seriously, eliciting a giggle from me.

I walk right, toward the nearest lift.

I press the button and it arrives quickly enough that I can tell it was only two or three floors down from us.

We step inside, the inertial dampening meaning we feel nothing at all as we descend 51 storeys and more than three hundred metres to ground level in a matter of 15 seconds.

Of course, emerging into the *bowels* of the building means we still have a long horizontal walk to the middle of the horseshoe, where R’qali etiquette dictates we should be to greet her.

It takes another few minutes, during which time I call up a mobile perch and send it to the meeting point for her to ride while we give her the tour.

She has neither of our stamina and offering her a shoulder to ride could *easily* be construed as an insult!

We finally come back out into the bright sunlight with the sloped ODR building surrounding us on all sides.

Walking forward to where Qarca stands beside the mobile perch (which, of course, beat us there), I take position on the furthest right from my perspective, my husband standing between me and the R’qali boy.

We wait for another few minutes before, emerging from the direction of Karatrataq, comes a small groundborne band.

I’m immediately able to pick out the unmistakable shapes of Victor ‘Cuddles’ Taylor and Emiko ‘Smiles’ Miyazaki, as well as a woman of that isolationist species from the eyeball world sitting a stone’s throw from Nova Fennoscandia.

Directly after, I notice a tall blonde woman and a short, orange haired Neanderthal whom I identify as Thran ‘Gimli’ Hunter.

The three R’qali are the last ones I’m able to pick out, needing to take an additional moment to discern which of the two women is my new boss before concluding that it’s probably the one *without* the artificial *leg*(!)

As they draw closer, I curiously note the strange lack of haughtiness in the woman’s bearing.

She looks… strangely *humble*?

Is that *always* how she carries herself when not on camera or is it a *new* development?

The glint of silver at the tall redhead’s left hand distracts me for a moment and I quickly find its counterpart on the upper left hand of the Don woman.

*Oooooh*! *That*’*s* some juicy gossip to share around the proverbial coffee machine later(!) The one and only Victor ‘Cuddles’ Taylor is either tying the knot or already *has*!

Wresting my mind away from that as the woman approaches, I warmly greet “Director Waqa’arc, 15^(th) Daughter of Highspire Peak. It’s a *pleasure*!” silently *willing* my husband not to emanate that intimidating aura of his in her direction(!)

“Likewise, Madam.” acknowledges the woman, dipping her head to me.

“My name is Ambassador Jemma ‘Shield’ Zonzambé-Marsh, Deputy Director, this is my husband Ambassador Kor ‘Hammer’ Marsh (who doubles as our Chief of Security) and that is Assistant Deputy Director Qarca. If you ever have any questions about your new role, please don’t hesitate to ask any of us!” I smile and gesture to the mobile perch with my whole hand “It’s a very *large* building and we don’t have time to show you quite *everything* today but shall we just start with a lightning tour of the place?”

AIO, What should I do?","To start before anyone says something stupid, I have anxious attachment. Its not because I'm insecure, its because of ADHD and when I don't have a phone call,  or a person in front of me giving me body language, tone, facial expressions, I have nothing to go off of and my brain starts to spin. 

So the context is I like this girl on hinge friday night last week, and she matched me back on saturday. Our messages got hot very quickly, with her calling me daddy, and boo and handsome in the first thread, and she eventually gave me her number without me asking. So far good signs imo. We text for the rest of saturday night, she explains that her apartment isn't clean because she just moved her a week ago and hasn't fully unpacked and decorated, okay fair im not that eager anyway. She sends me some hot photos again unprovoked that im shocked im receiving this early in the first conversations. Eventually the conversation ends and we go to bed 1-2am Sunday night.  

I decide to test if she was playing me or just having fun, so I don't text her until Sunday night at 8pm, see if shes still down to hang. She responds, but no bc she didn't clean her place, but she asks to speak to me on the phone. I oblige and she calls me and we talk on the phone all night, 5 fucking hours... I haven't done that since junior high. The call was great, lots of laughs, deep conversations, questions, flirting and getting to know each other personally and in depth. Either she's a master manipulator or we actually have chemistry is what I'm thinking. So 5am on Monday we make really vague plans to try and hangout sometime Monday night, and go to bed. 

I wake up late bc of the late night, she texts me ""gm handsome man"" tells me her plans for the day, and suggests we meet up for coffee after her shift. I say I'm down but nothings concrete, so I go about my day. Around 4:30pm I'm doing errands and she sends me 2 selfies of her makeup and outfit, and asks to ""come say hi?"" before she has to go into work. I say yes and get presentable before she shows. 

She shows up, and immediately we are already touching, close, in each others space, no guards up at all. I'm on her neck, caressing her skin, playing with her hair, she's touching my thighs, teasing and running her hands up my shorts but not all the way etc. Like there's a lot of good stuff happening and this was all during our conversations about life, her, me, everything just getting to know each other. In our conversations there were deep conversations, philosophy, personal, hypothetical questions, laughter from both of us, and even 2 moments where she was sharing something personal and hard that she's dealing with right now that got her choked up and she almost cried in front of me. I feel for her and I'll be there for her to vent to whenever she needs, I felt that her opening up and doing this was a good sign that she felt comfortable and safe with me, and safe with private personal info. I knew she had work soon, so I didn't push for sex but just doubled down on the playful flirting, sexual tension, being close and touching but stay firm and not going over board and from her body language she liked it. Overall I really enjoyed her company, and her words and actions mirrored that to me that she enjoyed mine as well. 

So now she has to leave, as she's going she tells me she has to leave town for a day or two to handle some stuff, might be back wednesday or thursday. Ok cool, I grab her for a kiss goodbye, it turns into a makeout session and she threw some tongue in there too. Okay cool great first meet imo. She leaves and after 5 minutes ish, if that tbh, she messages me, here is the text thread and the last things we said, we haven't reconnected since. 

 ""thanks for having me I had a great time, sorry I couldn't stay long"" 

I respond ""my pleasure, would love to see you again before you leave town"" 

we text about some other random stuff for a bit and then I pop the question one more time 

""should I plan on seeing you after your shift, what're you feeling""

 she responds ""i wish but probably not tonight😕 and feelings about what"" 

i respond ""i meant how're feeling about meeting up later not actual feelings lol"" 

she says: ""kk"" 

I say ""aight boo, let me know if anything changes. mines open if you want a break from yours, we can keep the good conversation going (first time i've called her boo back but shes called me boo dozens of times in just a weekend, the break from hers is because she just moved in and has told me shes stressed about unpacking)

She responds to that with ""🫡"" 

My last text to her was a video of the killer sunset that night ""crazy views tonight""

She replied '😍""

I didn't respond, I felt like she got busy at work or something was wrong. And we haven't reconnected since Monday night. 

Now my anxious mind kicks in, all the signals i got from her in person were amazing, and I felt we connected, not just from my own feelings, but her words and actions too. I'm really torn now, do I ignore it and reach out to her in a few days ""hey thinking about you"" ? Or do I wait entirely for her to reach back out to me? I have no idea what to do here. I want to escalate and do a real date but I need to know if shes on the same page with me still. She's also a RN, works overnight shifts, dealing with legal issues and all kinds of stuff going on in her life. Im not trying to push any of that aside I just can't get a read on her and where she stands with me after this first meet we had. 

Part of me wants to reach out tonight and just be lighthearted, but another part of me doesn't want to come off like needy and clingy and push her away. She knows i'm attracted to her, im pretty sure she is to me based on everything i experienced. Im aware shes busy, but i feel like 2 seconds to text me a check in etc isn't too much either. So I have no idea here.

1n1zqja,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1n1zqja/one_random_question_ruined_it_all/,One random question ruined it all.,"I moved to Norway early this year to be with my fiancé, with the purpose of getting married so I can stay here. We’ve been together for five years, it was long distance, but it’s by far the healthiest relationship I’ve ever had, which is why I said yes. I’m Asian and worked in the Dubai for eight years before moving here. My fiancé used to spend his holidays visiting me, and that’s how we kept our bond strong.

A little about my background: I had a rough childhood. My father was absent, my mother was emotionally unavailable and both physically and mentally abusive. I was raised mostly by my grandmother, who was later taken away from me. On top of that, my mother’s side of the family wasn’t kind either. I was often humiliated and made fun of. That probably shaped me into a distant person, but I’ve always been curious and driven, and that helped me pull through and try to build a life for myself.

My fiancé is kind, calm, and makes me feel safe. I could tell he was raised well, and in him I found peace. Over the years I also kept in touch with his mom through Instagram. She was warm and welcoming, and even knitted me a sweater as a gift when I first arrived in Norway. Everything was going well, lunches, coffees, dinners together until one day, during coffee, she suddenly asked if I will get a Norwegian passport after marriage. I answered honestly that I wouldn’t, at least not right away, since it takes time and there are requirements. I thought maybe she was just curious, until she brought up a story about an Asian woman who married a Norwegian man and couldn’t stay in Norway after they divorced. I wasn’t sure what she was trying to imply.

I told my fiancé and tried to brush it off, but a couple of days later, at a National Day party, she asked the same question again,  this time to her other son, in front of everyone. He answered her, but I was furious inside. It wasn’t enough that she asked me directly; she had to bring it up again publicly, right in front of me.

Months later, I still can’t move on. It feels like it stained the clean slate I offered her when we first met. Her family is otherwise lovely, my father-in-law has been nothing but kind. But I’m very sensitive. Because of my past, I pick up on things most people might miss. That single question made me feel unwelcome, like I had to prove myself. And maybe it hurt so much because she was the last person I expected to say something like that.

Since then, I’ve pulled away to protect myself. I stopped visiting as much, though I know I can’t avoid her forever. I think what makes it worse is that sometimes she also points things out about me during gatherings, and everyone joins in. I hate it, because that’s exactly how my relatives treated me growing up. Even if she doesn’t say anything outright bad, her tone can feel condescending.

All I really wanted was to be accepted and welcomed into a family, something I never had. That’s why it cut so deep. And though I love my fiancé and I don’t want this to ever come between us, I can’t deny how much it hurt and how hard it’s been to let go. Plus, I don’t think a person just says whatever without having those thoughts already in their head. ",2,1756345894.0,inlaws,3,0.75,False

i (20 F) have been working at a cafe in london for about 4 months now. about 2 months into me working there, a guy (25 M, let’s call him sam) from the cafe down the road came into my work and gave me a character plushie, telling me that he saw me working before he went on holiday and thought i would like it. i accepted it (i checked that there wasn’t anything in it because i’ve had experiences with trackers hidden in gifts before) and thanked him. from that day forward, we became work buddies, because we both have similar interests (anime, palestine, sanrio, coffee etc)

frankly, if i’d have known that same would take me accepting the plush as a signal as something more i wouldn’t have accepted it.. but i think it’s too late to return it now. 

because his cafe closes a few hours before mine, sam will come to my work after he’s finished, and stay until mine and my coworker(s) closing shifts end (i work closes only), every single day i work. this means that i see him 4 times a week, approximately for 4-5 hours at a time. this started to make me quite uncomfortable, especially since im a bit introverted and my social battery tends to run quite low, even more so when someone is distracting me at work when i need to be closing, serving customers or making drinks. i genuinely cannot concentrate on a task and remembering which tasks in which order i need to do next whilst sam is standing there and talking at me for hours at a time. 

i have a gorgeous boyfriend of a year and a half and we live together during the week so i can get to work easier. sam knows this and has known this since we met for the first time / had our first proper conversation. in fact, not only does he know that i’m in a long term, committed relationship, he has met my boyfriend numerous times and has even been in his car!!! 

my boyfriend mentioned that sam would always stare at me whilst his body language facing towards me and flirt with me whilst at work, and that helped me realise that i felt uncomfortable because sam was both disrespecting me and my boyfriend. my manager brought it up today and asked if i thought that sam liked me because she thought it was ‘obvious’ and it clicked that i don’t want him around me anymore, especially since he follows me around the store when i’m trying to do my job, even in the staff-only areas. 

how do i reject him and reinforce my boundaries properly? 

i’m just very tired of having to work extra hard to stay on top of my duties, especially since my shifts are usually 10 hours long.

if you have any advice at all, please let me know!! 

tldr: guy from cafe down the road knows i’m not interested in him but keeps flirting and going out his way to spend time with me at work and i’m tired of it.

Tons of tone options, effects, and play-along features. Speakers are directional and distort if pushed, but headphones sound great. App control is excellent, and the bass amp models are surprisingly good.

---

I got my Spark 2 in July (2025) and have really enjoyed it with my bass (active MM-style pickups from Seymour Duncan). I only use it as a near-field practice amp in my living room. I usually set it on the coffee table in front of me and face it directly. The sound is pretty directional, and the rich lows don’t carry more than a few feet, so I tilt it upward toward my face. I run the Spark app on my phone, which sits on a table top stand next to the amp, and I control almost everything from there except instrument and music level.

When I first got it, I dialed in some bass tones I liked in the app and saved them to the hardware presets. I’ve been working through the effects pedals just to see what they all do. This week I discovered there are 4 dedicated bass amp models (#36–39), and I’m excited to try them all. Back in the day I had a Fender BXR 100 combo with just a Boss OD-B3 and PH-3 Phaser, so the sheer number of tone options in the Spark 2 feels breathtaking. 

Most of my practice time has been in the Music tab. I figured out how to set up the groove looper with drum patterns instead of a metronome, which is great for exercises or working through old riffs I used to play in a band 15–20 years ago. The looper is a little quirky, and the drum tracks can be tough to navigate since they don’t sort by name and some only show up when shuffle is on, but overall it’s way more fun than playing to a click.

I’ve also started messing with the Jams. At first I skipped them since they always played the bass part, but I realized today you can toggle bass off in both Smart Jam and Quick Jam. Unfortunately, Smart Jam crashes my app, but I’d love to use it to generate drum + keys or rhythm guitar grooves. It would be amazing if you could feed it vocal cues—like beatboxing or singing riffs—and have the virtual band play them back.

I’ve also enjoyed pulling up premade backing track videos and using the chord analysis to follow along, and I’ve generated a few tone presets I like in the AI tab and saved them.

As for sound, the speakers do a reasonable job reproducing bass in the near field, but they distort pretty easily if you push them. Careful gain staging between the amp and effects helps keep levels consistent across presets. Through headphones, though, it sounds great.

Things I’m looking forward to exploring more:

Tones, FX, and the bass amp models

Learning new songs and playing along with bass-removed versions

Getting more use out of Quick Jam / Smart Jam

Learning how to use the looper properly 

Hardware add-ons like the foot controller or even pairing it with the Spark Cab for a true FRFR setup

I already knew that the coffee shop was there. It always has been. But what I DIDN'T know was that you could buy coffee there that heals you in the light world (despite the fact that your HP there is almost always 20/20). 

So, I drank it, but since the game made it clear that darkners are objects in the light world but get transformed into possibly living things when it gets darker than dark, I bought ANOTHER cup of coffee and brought it to Castle Town. But, to my disappointment, there wasn't anything special like an edible or a weapon/armor in my inventory. Also, I looked around Castle Town to see if there was anything like a building or a character, but everything looked the same. 

Sure, that Cafe building that's shaped like a coffee mug could be it, but that was there BEFORE I brought the cup of coffee there. But what do you guys think?

I work remotely, and we had a big client meeting scheduled with my boss and about 12 other people on Zoom. I thought, This is my chance to look sharp and professional.”So I put on my best shirt, fixed my hair, and even practiced my “attentive nodding” in the mirror.
The problem is, I only dressed from the waist up. Below camera level, I was rocking SpongeBob pajama shorts. No big deal, right? I’ve been doing this for years.
Halfway through the meeting, my boss says, Can you share your screen, but also grab that binder from your shelf? It’ll be easier to explain.
Now, my shelf is about three feet behind me. I figured, I’ll just stand up quickly, grab it, and sit back down before anyone notices.

What I didn’t account for was two things:
My webcam was tilted down slightly.
My pajama shorts are BRIGHT YELLOW with little Patrick Stars all over them.
I stood up, heard a weird silence, then the client bursts out laughing. My boss mutters, Oh my god, and one of the senior managers goes, Nice outfit, champ.
In panic mode, I knocked over my coffee mug, which spilled directly onto my keyboard. Zoom immediately froze on the most unflattering screenshot of me standing in SpongeBob shorts with my mouth wide open like I’d just seen a ghost.
Needless to say, I spent the rest of the meeting quietly listening on my phone while IT tried to resuscitate my laptop.

She has since passed away, but I still feel like I’m under attack and I don’t know how to move on. I need support and suggestions.

My MIL was married to my FIL for over 30 years. On the outside, they looked like a church family (they were even ministers once), but behind closed doors they lived off SSI checks, sold pills, and struggled with addiction. Their relationship was toxic he cheated on her many times, even fathering a child outside the marriage.

Her daughter (my SIL) and (my FIL )niece both told me she practiced witchcraft in the past putting things in her husband’s food, and burying his clothes for spells. I once saw my SIL scream at her dad, “You’re with someone who did witchcraft on you!” He just stared like he already knew.

When I lived with them during the pandemic, I got sick constantly weak, nauseous, drained no matter what I ate. One day she offered me dark coffee, but something in me told me not to drink it. Later that day, I overheard her bragging about putting poison out for the neighbors’ chickens. That moment confirmed my fears.

My MIL was always jealous of me. On birthdays/holidays she was cold and bitter, and even though she’d say she “admired me,” it felt fake. After moving in with them, I felt like beauty magic had been done on me I gained weight out of nowhere, and I started feeling stuck in life, like I didn’t have control over myself.

Eventually, my fiancé and I moved out after a huge fight. He went no contact with them for months. But they didn’t stop they teamed up with his exes on social media to talk about me, all while pretending to be “holy church people.”

His family often tried to demonize me, even accusing me of witchcraft and being evil. But the truth is, before I ever came into the picture, my fiancé was the man of his household. He took care of his siblings and parents, buying them anything they wanted. He was their so-called “breadwinner.” His mom was obsessed with him, often talking to him in a baby voice. And whenever they didn’t get their way with him, they would become cruel, bringing up his hardships and even blaming them on me. I wouldn’t put it past them that they wanted to hold him back from becoming independent and starting his own family, just so he could continue taking care of them.


Then came something I can’t shake: in five years, my MIL had never given me a single thing. Suddenly, she bought me underwear. I never touched them. My SIL announced she was pregnant, and right after that, 4 days later my MIL unexpectedly passed away. Around that time, I kept seeing posts online about womb magic blocking pregnancies and hateful women attacking divine feminines. It all felt too connected.

Two months later, my SIL told me during an argument: “My mom never liked you.” I already knew, but hearing it confirmed everything. She even admitted she had belongings of mine I left behind and threatened to post them online.

On top of that, I had recurring dreams of my MIL attacking me. I’d wake up crying. To me, these were more than dreams they felt like spiritual warfare.

As for my SIL, she still carries the same malice, jealousy, and bitterness. At times it feels like she’s tried to “finish the job.” But karma has already touched her life, for I wouldn’t wish it on any woman especially during her pregnancy and postpartum. Out of respect, I won’t share details but it’s proof to me that you can’t sow darkness and expect light to follow

Through it all, my fiancé has been my biggest support, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t traumatized. At times I feel stuck not in my relationship, but in life. I don’t always feel like I’m in control of myself. I’ve prayed, I’ve tried to move forward, but I can’t shake the feeling that some of that darkness is still lingering over me.

I know some people will call me crazy, but I believe everything happens for a reason. I also believe that when you practice dark magic, it comes with a cost my MIL’s death felt like that cost. But right now, I just want peace and freedom

1n1yvw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/flowcytometry/comments/1n1yvw2/sanity_check_request_on_my_hdflow_qc_pipeline/,Sanity check request on my HD-flow QC pipeline,"  
Hi all.

I've been building a high-dimensional flow analysis pipeline for our lab over the past several months and would really appreciate a sanity check on my methodology. Outside of a lot of youtube and AI, I've been solo on this - PI asked us to figure out high dimensional flow and I said ok, will do. Sorry in advance for the detail, and long post: Just feeling quite insane and wanting to make sure I cover everything. Grab that cup of black coffee, raise that single eyebrow, and let me have it, *constructively,* please*.*

For quick context, our datasets are multi-year, multi-batch non-human primate transplant studies - typically 2–3 years of archived data across 40+ batches, all fresh PBMCs collected every 2–4 weeks depending on the study. I have tried to design a traditional and defensible workflow similar in spirit to published pipelines (for example, work from the Saeys Lab). Most of the pipeline is done inside FlowJo, with a few QC, transformation, and normalization steps done in R.

Why not just do everything in R? The short version is that there are quirks in how our lab has historically run flow and how the legacy data was collected, and our lab is generally reticent to use R. It all makes a pure R workflow less practical. I’ll dive into that and other challenges after outlining the pipeline.

Our pipeline:   
In FlowJo first. 

* Import raw FCS files and add keywords (animal ID, timepoint, etc.).
* Build per-batch compensation matrices using single-stain controls from that day; if missing, substitute with the closest valid batch or cell-based comps.
* Manually check each matrix for under/over-compensation and adjust as needed.
* Apply compensation, export the FCS files to rewrite compensation headers, and re-import. 
   * A note: the lab runs compensation on the cytometer and applies it - in general it's all bead comps and most have inadequate event counts in their positive peaks and need to be tossed, or are beyond the max of the cytometer and clip our data.
* Run PeacoQC with standard settings to clean events.
* Gate down to major parents (CD4, CD8, CD20, or “all immune” depending on panel).
* Export gated files and harmonize channel names with Premessa.

R (QC, transform, normalization) - Several scripts run sequentially, takes 1-2 hours. 

* Run integrity checks: header and metadata (bit depth, range, corruption).
* Compensation checks
* Fix any non-data parameter issues with a header script.
* Estimate per-channel cofactors per batch using a grid search. Static cofactors for only certain channels
* Apply arcsinh transformation; generate pre- and post-transform QC plots/logs.
* Audit bimodality and negative clouds per channel to plan normalization. (catching any bad cofactors)
* Landmark-based Normalization
   * Warpset or Gaussnorm - intensities axis allignment only, no change in proportions. 
   * Significant non-uniform axis drift between batches in certain channels- sometimes +/- 0.5 Log or greater. Can be differential, concerted, or compressive. What should be two distinct populations turns into a smear on concatenation.
* Run CytoNorm 2.0 for it's QC metrics (EMD, MAD) to measure batch-effect reduction.
   * I can't run cytonorm 2.0 fully because the average or the ideal reference overly warps/normalizes changing biology

Back to FlowJo

* Return normalized files, remove remaining outliers.
* Concatenate files and run high-dimensional analysis (UMAP, t-SNE, PaCMAP).
* Clustering: FlowSOM (sometimes X-Shift).
* Use Cluster Explorer for annotation and downstream analysis.

In total, it takes about 1-2 weeks to fully complete the pipeline on a dataset (but were also new at this). Most of the time is spent getting the compensation together for all the batches and then just doing the actual analysis once we've concatenated the files. 

Current Conundrum: Some colleagues in the lab have suggested a simplified version of the pipeline under the rationale of saving time and making it accessible to everyone without needing to learn R. They've proceeded forward with this toned down pipeline with the following omissions:  
  
1. No Batch specific Compensation: Blind application of a single bead-based compensation matrix across all batches across the 2–3 years of the experiment. Reasoning - Individual compensation matrices take too long to put together for the batches.

2. No transformation, data kept linear/raw. No normalization. Reasoning: Can't expect folks to learn R, too complicated, takes too long.  
  
The “powers that be” want a quick dimensionality reduction plot and some flow data, even if it is not perfect, since flow is not considered the primary dataset in our manuscripts. I understand the motivation, but I worry this approach will introduce significant artifact that get misinterpreted as biology. 

So given all of this, I would really value feedback from this community on my File QC pipeline - am I doing this right? Is it overkill? I have left some detail out for brevity (Hah). Are there better ways to do what I'm trying to do? Importantly, Is there a middle-ground approaches I should consider that falls in line with my colleagues or is some of this non-negotiable for the datasets I'm working with?

She was standing at the bus stop, staring out into the gray, her hair damp from the drizzle. He had offered her his umbrella, a small gesture, but it had made her smile. That smile—it was the kind that made you believe in the impossible.

They started seeing each other after that. Coffee dates turned into long walks, and long walks turned into late-night conversations that stretched into the early hours. She spoke of dreams, of building a life full of laughter and love. He listened, captivated, and began to believe in a future he had never imagined for himself.

She painted pictures with her words, of a home they would share, of adventures they would take together. Every word was a brushstroke, filling in the gaps of his lonely existence. For the first time in years, he felt like he was part of something beautiful, something real.

But there were moments, brief and fleeting, when he saw something in her eyes that made him hesitate. A flicker of doubt, a shadow of distance. He brushed it off, telling himself it was nothing. They were building something together. That’s what she said, after all.

He gave himself to her, piece by piece. He showed her his heart, shared his dreams, let her into the parts of him he had always kept hidden. He loved her with an intensity that frightened him, but he didn’t hold back. She was worth it. She made him believe they were worth it.

Then, slowly, things began to change.

She started pulling away, her words less frequent, her touch less warm. He felt the shift, the way she seemed to drift from him, but when he asked, she would smile and tell him everything was fine. “I’m just overwhelmed,” she would say. “There’s a lot going on right now.” He wanted to believe her, so he did.

But the distance grew. She stopped talking about the future, stopped weaving dreams into their conversations. He felt the gap widening between them, but he kept trying, kept holding onto the vision she had built for them.

Until the day she told him it was over.

She sat across from him in the café where they had shared their first date, her eyes cold, her expression unreadable. “I can’t do this anymore,” she said, her voice flat. “There’s too much happening in my life. I need space. I need time to figure things out.”

He felt the floor drop from beneath him, the world spin off its axis. He asked why, pleaded for an explanation. Hadn’t they been building something together? Wasn’t this what they both wanted?

She sighed, a sound filled with exasperation. “I don’t know,” she said, looking away. “I just can’t do this right now. It’s not what I thought it would be.”

He stared at her, trying to understand. She had been the one to paint the dreams, to lead him into this world of possibilities. She had made him believe in a future they could build together, and now she was leaving, saying it wasn’t what she wanted after all.

She got up, leaving him there, alone in the place where it had all begun. He watched her walk away, the door closing behind her with a finality that echoed through his soul. She was gone, and she had left him with nothing but the shattered pieces of his heart.

In the weeks that followed, he replayed her words over and over in his mind. He questioned everything. Had he misunderstood? Had he wanted too much? But then he remembered the dreams she had painted, the promises she had made. She had led him into this, given him a vision of a future they could build together. And then she had left him to carry the weight of it alone.

It wasn’t that he hadn’t tried. He had tried with everything he had. But you can’t build something with someone who was never really there. She had given him an illusion, a beautiful one, but it was never real.

He learned, slowly, to let go of the dream. To accept that some people come into your life to show you what you want, and then leave to teach you how to find it on your own. It was a harsh lesson, one that left scars on his heart. But in time, he understood that he wasn’t to blame. He had loved honestly, openly, and in the end, that was all he could do.

He still thinks of her sometimes, on rainy afternoons when the world feels heavy and gray. He wonders if she ever thinks of him, if she regrets what they lost. But he knows now that some questions have no answers, and some loves are meant to teach you how to love yourself.

And so, he moves forward, a little wiser, a little stronger, and with the hope that one day, he will find someone who doesn’t lead him into dreams only to leave him there alone.",1,1756343444.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I finished with a playful sticker dump page, where each of us can add our own little piece as the journal travels—like leaving pressed flowers in a shared book!

It can take a LONG TIME for it to go down to normal. 

My first session was today at 7am therefore I was dehydrated and lacking in electrolytes. Because of this, it took much longer for my heart rate to return to normal. After nearly two hours of waiting, and me explaining over and over about POTS, and about how i DONT always have tachycardia, and that NO, me skipping my morning cup of coffee won’t cure POTS for future sessions, they repeatedly tried to send me home. I kept convincing them to let me stay longer but had to re-explain POTS to them about ten times, and they acted like I was describing quantum mechanics.

Anyway, it was a very frustrating experience, and while eventually my heart rate did get to below 100, Im scared for my next appointment. what can I do to prevent this from happening again? Is there any chance they would make an exception for me due to my medical condition? Im pretty sure the reason it even took so long to get below 100 was because of the frustration and anxiety of having to re-explain myself and worrying I wouldn’t be able to get this treatment. My heart rate was 72 two hours after administering btw.

I was so excited to start spravato, but i really dont want this to be a recurring thing. I feel like it made a huge impact on my actual treatment. I know for sure next time im just going to ignore the 30 minute no drinking thing and make sure i get plenty of electrolytes so my HR will decrease faster. I just want to know if they ever make exceptions for this kind of thing.",1,1756342786.0,Spravato,0,1.0,False
