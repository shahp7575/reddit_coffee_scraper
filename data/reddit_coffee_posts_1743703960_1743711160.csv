1jqsr19,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1jqsr19/how_do_you_not_lose_control/,How do you not lose control,"Hello Keto friends.
I recently posted I had found something that worked for my currently stalled weight loss. It was a rather extreme OMAD that was keto with 2 bulletproof collagen coffees per day. 
This worked for three days and led to excellent weight loss but then on day 4 I tripped up and I’ve been struggling since. Each day trying to stay keto but then stress eating carbs. I’m constantly trying to devise a plan that will work. For example I recently thought well what if I allow one carb heavy thing each week like maybe every Saturday or Sunday allowing just one thing, like one bagel for example or some candy. Not both but just one thing. So far this does not seem to work very well. 
Just curious what works for you guys to consistently lose weight? And not feel deprived.

# What Is The Healing Wave?

*The Healing Wave* is a 20-minute **audio program** that uses **Neural Entrainment for deep healing**. It targets **theta brainwaves**, associated with rest, emotion release, and *not screaming into a pillow at 2 a.m.*.

Think of it as a sound bath without the fancy spa robe. You listen with headphones, and the track guides your brain into **theta frequency vibration** — that dreamy space between sleep and wakefulness.

It’s a **brainwave track**, not a meditation app. No rain sounds or motivational whispers here. Just raw, frequency-driven audio crafted to encourage **theta wave meditation for healing**.

If you’ve been hunting for the **best audio to reach theta state**, this one pulls no punches. And no, it’s not another random YouTube loop with a dolphin crying in the background.

# How Does It Work?

This isn't a playlist. It's **sound therapy to trigger theta brainwaves** through precise frequency design. [Your brain responds](https://theworldhealth.org/healing-wave-original-official) by syncing up — like a kid mirroring dance moves at a wedding.

Theta is the brain’s deep-relaxation zone. It’s the land of **sound healing brainwaves**, creative flow, and deep rest. For many, that space feels unreachable without years of monk-level meditation.

The track sidesteps all that. You lie back, press play, and drift. The **sound frequencies for emotional healing** do the heavy lifting, helping your brain reach the sweet spot faster.

It's a lazy person’s dream — a passive way to **activate healing brainwaves** without breaking a mental sweat.

# What’s Included?

Here’s what comes with *The Healing Wave* purchase:

* 🎧 **The Healing Wave audio track** — A focused tool for **subconscious healing through sound**.

\-

\-

* 🙏 **The Healing Prayer** — Uses ideas from neurotheology, enhancing the track's effects for those seeking **spiritual healing through audio**.

\-

* 📊 **5 Habits Infographic** — Helps build consistency for **daily theta wave practice**.

These extras complete the **brainwave therapy at home** setup — no robes, gongs, or breathwork required.

# Personal Experience With The Healing Wave

My brother's friend, Dean is a night-shift paramedic — calm under pressure but not exactly the poster boy for “inner peace.” Between 12-hour shifts, erratic sleep, and the emotional toll of emergency work, he’d been running on fumes for years.

He was never one for meditation (his words: “I don’t have the monk beard for it”), but after one too many nights staring at the ceiling at 4 a.m., he was willing to try something different.

That’s when I sent him [The Healing Wave](https://theworldhealth.org/healing-wave-original-official).

Dean started using it in the early afternoons, just after his shift, right before crawling into bed. By the third session, he texted me: *“This track is weird. It knocks me out but also makes me feel... cleared out? Like I just deleted 100 tabs in my brain.”* Not exactly clinical, but very Dean.

Over the next couple of weeks, his mood noticeably shifted. He wasn’t as irritable. His sleep, while still short, felt deeper. He said it gave him the kind of quiet his job never could.

**The healing frequencies for the brain** seemed to offer him a place to land — a mental decompression chamber, if you will.

His only complaint? “Same track every time. Could use a remix.” Fair. Even good loops get stale. Still, he was pretty taken with this single-file **music for cellular healing** approach.

# Who Is This For?

This works best for people who want calm without rituals. Busy professionals, exhausted parents, and serial overthinkers are ideal candidates for **audio therapy for pain relief** and mental reset.

If you’re curious about **theta state meditation benefits** but allergic to new-age fluff, this hits the middle ground. No app subscriptions. Just sound.

It’s one of the few tracks that does exactly what it claims. For many, it is the **best audio to reach theta state** hands down.

Kirishima feeling worried went to see if something was wrong with him, much to Bakugo's disappointment as he tried to stop him, when an annoyed and angry Izuku picked him up by the head, lifted him up above his head and threw him into the common room. From there it became a brawl as most of, not including the girls, Bakugo, Todoroki, and Koda, watched Izuku defeat them all swiftly.

Once Izuku was done he went to the fridge and pulled out his coffee creamer before making his coffee how he likes it and takes a sip. He let's out a low sigh before turning to Bakugo and asks him what he missed. This is when Bakugo tells everyone that Izuku is extremely aggressive before he has his morning coffee.

At the train station we got a coffee and asked explicitly to do two single shots. Which turned to surprise.

Would be cute if all the rivals had perfume too but I just made the perfumes Ayano has in the start of the game/the one she could by in the lingerie store (which could be replace by a beauty store or could still be a lingerie store as some lingerie store like Victoria Secrets sell perfume.) 

Anyway here’s the perfume, their description (very similar to the panties) their boost (pretty much the same as the panties except for a couple) as well as which perfume in the real world they were inspired by as most of them were inspired by real perfume bottles

1. Vanilla- Only a boring girl would wear a vanilla scent (Students will take longer to notice Ayano + Default Scent) [Inspired by Fantasy by Britney Spears]

2. Lavender and Mint- Isn’t there a myth that lavender and mint scents helps you focus? (The protagonist will receive a bonus when studying) [Inspired by Goddess by Burberry] {Lowkey messed on the colors 😬}

3. Sakura/Cherry Blossom- Pink is the color of compassion, nurturing, and love (The protagonist will receive a bonus when matchmaking two people)

4. Coffee- Something about this scent is comforting, like you can trust people who wear it (The protagonist will receive a bonus when spreading rumors) [Inspired by Kayali Musk]

5. Cherry- Red the color of a femme fatal (Pools of blood created after murder will be smaller, less bloody footprints) [Inspired by Good Girl by Carolina Herrera]

6. Strawberry- A girl who wears these perfumes must be sweet, just like strawberries (The protagonist will receive a bonus when socializing with students.)

7. Bubblegum Cotton Candy Perfume- This is a kid perfume, is it not? (The protagonist will receive a bonus when apologizing to students. She will gain 75% of reputation back.) [Inspired Toy2 by Moschino]

8. Lemon Sorbet- All the athletes really love this scent (The protagonists running speed is increased to six meters per second, if not combined with anything else) [Inspired by Mod Blush by Ariana Grande]

9. Blackberry- Black is the color of mystery, secrecy, and evil. (The protagonist sanity meter will decrease at a much slower rate.) Inspired by La Belle by Jean Paul]

I personally like how perfumes fit with how the game is supposed to be cute and girlies in the surface without being creepy and having bile inducing descriptions like some of the panties do. I also think it would be cool to take perfume to school and cover up the scent of blood with them whenever you commit a murder. ",3,1743710385.0,RyobaAishi,0,1.0,False

I'm (21M) an international student here in Leipzig, and I've been living and studying at the university for about 3.5 years now. While I do have a group of friends from my academic life, I’ve realized that my social circle tends to be pretty limited to that professional context. I’ve tried university sports courses and some of the events organized by the university, but I haven’t really found anything that’s stuck.

A little about me: I love playing the guitar, and I was really into producing my own music before I started university—it’s still something I enjoy as a hobby. I’m into ""indie"" music like Dayglow and Wallows, but I also do love my punk and rock/metal (think Blink-182 and Linkin Park). Pop music is also something I appreciate. When it comes to gaming, I’m into casual gaming (like rocket League/Stardew Valley/story focused games) and I’d love to try out some board games as well—I actually have a deluxe edition of Cabo and I’m always down to try new games.

I also really enjoy being outdoors, especially when the weather’s nice. I like heading to the park for frisbee or kicking a ball around, or just taking a walk through the city.

While my German isn’t perfect, I’m always happy to practice and improve. I'd also be open to language exchange, so if you're looking to practice English, feel free to reach out and we can help each other out!

1jqsi3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApartmentHacks/comments/1jqsi3z/strange_dustlike_smell_in_my_attic_apartment/,"Strange, dust-like smell in my attic apartment","Hi fellow Redditors,

I'm posting this on different subreddits, hoping to gather as many ideas and insights as possible.

**TL;DR**: A strange smell (resembling a mixture of dust and ground coffee) has appeared twice in my attic apartment, causing me to cough. There is no obvious cause (no mold, dust, etc). I'd appreciate ideas on what it could be.

**Long version:**

I moved into my apartment 5 years ago. It is in the attic of a 6-story building (there are 8 apartments on each floor, including the attic).

No issues until four days ago, when I felt a strong smell of what I would describe as dust mixed with ground coffee.

I walked through my apartment to find the source of the smell, but I couldn't find anything. I also smelled the same thing in the hallway outside my apartment (it was neither stronger nor weaker than in my apartment).

I coughed pretty hard, like there was an irritant of some sort.

The next day, the smell disappeared gradually, but there was still an irritation in my throat and lungs. I went out and when I returned in the evening, the smell and the irritation were completely gone.

No issues for a few days. Then, last night, the whole scenario repeated.

I have no clue what it could be. I'd appreciate any ideas/experiences from you. Maybe it's a thing with attic apartments?

A few facts that could help:

\- All my windows were closed both times. Also, my apartment door closes very tightly.

\- I have an exhaust fan in my bathroom, and it was turned on at the time (so theoretically, nothing should be coming through it into my apartment). No other ventilation in the apartment.

\- It was raining both times when I felt the smell, but it also rained in the meantime, when there was no smell at all, so I don't know if rain is a factor.

\- The place is very, very clean. No dust, no coffee grains lying around, no dirty coffee mugs. I'm mentioning this because it smelled like dust mixed with ground coffee.

\- There are no signs of mold anywhere.

\- I haven't brought in any new furniture or home decor recently.",1,1743710329.0,ApartmentHacks,1,1.0,False

If your partner cheated and you broke up, but then decided to give it another shot—how did it go?
Were you able to rebuild trust and make it work long-term, or did it eventually fall apart again?
Also, what helped or hurt the process of moving forward?

My ex is i suspect fearful avoidantn mixed with narcicist, he witheld sex a lot, but once I opened relationship he had sex with everyone multiple times. Like with me it was once a month and after opening he did it daily with others but still not with me. 

Edit 1: First time he cheated was when we were in closed relationship and i was out of the country and met a friend for coffee. He thought i cheated (which i didnt) and cheated instead. My therapist said that i created distance and if he was FA he would be glad for that distance and would not have revenge like cheating. He witheld sex ever since beginning of relationship. This happened around 2 month mark. I didnt know he cheated so we stayed 4y in relationship. At the end i gave ultimatum, either we had sex more, we open relationship or we break up. He decided to open relationship and had sex with many people but not with me. We broke up and a month later he found a new bf. Then 2m later they broke up and he found another. He replaced me easily while i still linger and wait. I think this may be trauma bond since i think im anxious attached.

Edit 2: If he is FA and comes back I will give more ultimatums like admiting what he did, seeing a couole therapist, full transparency and I want everything that was given to strangers to be given to me. But im coping even if he agrees to this, it would be because of my demands and not him wanting me trully.",1,1743710158.0,ExNoContact,2,1.0,False

So, imagine this: It's a typical Monday morning, you sit down with your coffee and your trusty to-do list... and by the end of the day, you've crossed off about two things. Been there? 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️ 

Well, I decided to shake things up a bit, **replace my to-do list with time blocking**, and see if it could save me from my eternal state of over-commitment. Spoiler alert: **It worked**! I gained back a whopping **10 hours** each week! 🕒 Here's how I did it:

- **Wake Up & Plan**: I start each morning with a mindful cup of coffee (critical, right? ☕) and a quick review of my calendar. Instead of listing tasks, I block out chunks of time dedicated to specific activities. It’s like giving each task its reservation!  

- **The Essentialist's Guide**: I focus on the big rocks. You know, those crucial tasks that really push the needle. I stopped sweating the small stuff...If it’s not gonna change my life, it gets a small time slot or none at all.  

- **Block Party**: Large or complex projects get larger chunks of time. Smaller tasks are grouped together. This way, I'm not constantly ""context-switching"" and losing precious time down the rabbit hole of distraction!🐇  

- **The Real MVP – Breaks!**: I gotta say, the MVP of my day is the intentional breaks. Yep, actual, scheduled chill time. With these breaks, my mind feels sharper and more refreshed. Funny how NOT working can make us more productive, huh?  

- **Evening Review**: At day's end, I reflect on what went well and what didn’t. Next day’s blocks get adjusted accordingly. It’s about progress, not perfection. And trust me, it’s rewarding to see how much gets done without the perpetual panic of an unfinished to-do list!

So, friends, swapping my to-do list for time blocking not only saved me time but also *stress*. I’m feeling more balanced, and perhaps unexpectedly, more creative!

Have any of you swapped your organization style before? Did it make a difference for you? Would love to hear about your experiments or quirky tips that keep productivity fun and *not* a four-letter word. 😊

I'm feeling a lot better. My appetite is mostly back but not 100% yet. I'm still taking it easy with food but I have been able to occasionally have coffee and a drink - so it does get better!

I lost 10 pounds due to this. I know that's not a lot compared to others. I really would like to gain at least 3 - 5 pounds back. You'd think this would be easy!

I did not drink until maybe 6 months ago. I found a cider (ciderboys cran razz) that I enjoyed. This opened up my interest. Still haven't been super drunk but so far my likes/dislikes.

I was told, due to my coffee habits, Stouts and Porters may be good. As such I tried Great Lakes Cookie Exchange this year which was a peanut butter/chocolate milk stout. It was decent, but had a chemically after taste I didn't love. Also found a founders I enjoyed. 

I was also told because I want refreshing and light but not bready or bitter (I think at least... more on this later) that Ales, Sours, Hefeweisen (sp?) and Saisons may be up my alley. I have tried all besides a Saison and have enjoyed them. I have found a ""non-flavored"" ale I enjoy from Great Lakes that is their Easy Bucket Blonde, and also their cran orange wheat. I also have found Urban Artifact Peaches n Cream, Gadget, and Capy Snacks fruit punch to be very enjoyable.

So, in theory in beverages I usually don't like bitter, and I usually don't like spice (although I did find an alcoholic ginger beer from jamaica I enjoyed). In coffee i trend towards light roasts with a pronounced fruit/acid component OR a very milk/dark chocolate with some nutty and maybe stone fruit. I do pour overs, lattes, cortados. In my pour overs I usually take 5-15 grams of sugar depending on the day, and in my lattes about the same amount of sugar or heavy syrup (currently doing a home made cinnamon maple syrup)

Also, might be important, I live in North East Ohio. Knowing all this, what would the fine folks of reddit steer me towards trying to find?

I am open to lagers/pilsners but because I still in my head think ""I have tried those when I was younger and hated them and thats why i stayed away for so long"" I feel like I won't care for them (i tried them to taste before using in recipes just so I understood about what I was getting) but willing to give it a shot if they can be easily found in a pick a six pack sort of scenario.

I said sorry and offered to give him the $9.00 in cash just to make it up to him and that id start using my own card again. He said the money isn’t the issue it’s the fact that I used his points that he earned. He said those points are pretty much his little “reward” for getting gas frequently. He made it sound like I was trying to get a quick, free discount at the expense of him filling his gas tank multiple times a week (he’s a mail carrier). It takes maybe a month-ish to build up $9 in rewards.


For context, He has a card on both of his sets of keys (he has 2 cars, drives both) and he will scan it for rewards whenever he gets gas or uses it inside the specific gas station/grocery store. I drive his other vehicle right now, (he drives it still too when he’s not working) so when I go grocery shopping for us, get gas, etc I ALSO use his loyalty card. I do have my own loyalty card but I never think use it because his card is on the keys that I use.


I buy all the groceries in the house and also get gas. He primarily uses it for gas or grabbing a coffee from the gas station. I get where he was coming from in thinking that I just used up all his points but it doesn’t really make much sense considering I’ve probably earned half of those myself. I have no issue with using my own card from now on, it never seemed like an issue to me so I never really thought about my own card. 


I really didn’t find this matter to be a big deal at all but he kept going and going on about it for like 5 mins. If the tables were turned I wouldn’t care because regardless the points are being used for a necessity.

I (32 F) and my boyfriend (33 M) of two years have an ongoing issue that boils down to me being insecure and resentful. 

He shares custody of his two dogs with his ex and picks a dog up a few times a month for the days he's off work. 

In the beginning, it was a bit uncomfortable but as a dog lover, I knew the importance of the shared custody. However, a couples months into the agreement, he and I had an argument and he made a joke to his ex about it. (The joke was a long the lines of ""well if you wanna win my heart you could buy me my favorite coffee"" since we were fighting about her buying him gifts and stuff) 

Even though that was well over a year ago, I was devastated and embarrassed.

I will usually tag along when he picks up a dog as we're usually doing stuff like grabbing groceries at the same time. He recently made a comment about it, saying he invites me to ""babysit"" him.

I've tried suggesting that he not go inside her house to get the dog anymore but he argued against it, stating the house is still in his name and he also wants to see his other dog (he picks up one at a time since we have 3 at my house). 

I'm at a loss and I guess all I can do is accept it and try to get over the insecurity. 

Does anyone have a suggestion for how to let go? I've already told him I'm no longer riding along for pickups since I'm not interested in being seen as a controlling gf or babysitter. 

I don't like feeling this way and can't help but feel like she's enjoying the attention and likes knowing that I'm annoyed.

(Context: she has a boyfriend, too. They have talked about how her bf is uncomfortable with him - I overheard this conversation and asked why they were talking about their partners with each other... That talk didn't go well.) ",1,1743709295.0,relationship_advice,8,0.67,False

When I stepped to the side he said, “jeez you can’t help an old man back out of a door way” when he said it, he said it in a way that was extremely rude. Keep in mind that I barely just got to see this thing he was moving around. Before i could even respond he backs out of the doorway and says something along the lines of “you’re an asshole” or “you don’t have to be an asshole”, and at that point I got pissed and I had a mini explosion of anger and I told him “well how the fuck am I supposed to know you were backing out”.

Why?,"I'm a 29F bisexual/queer woman, who has historically exclusively dated other women. I'm starting to notice a pattern with men in dating and I'm not sure where it's coming from.

Two years ago, I was dating a man for about three months when he broke things off. He acted so admiring of me and interested, but then cut it off suddenly, saying it ""just wasn't what he wanted."" 

Last year, I was in my first real relationship with a guy; he pursued me for six months, and when we were together told me that he was convinced I was the love of his life, etc. etc. We got along well and had very little conflict while dating. Five months in he broke up with me seemingly out of nowhere. When I asked him for an explanation as to why he acted absolutely livid with me, and talked as if I'd betrayed him somehow. It was so bizarre that I'm convinced he must have been cheating or something. 

Then I started seeing another guy, who told me that he would miss me after even a day of not seeing each other. We were seeing each other 3-4 times a week, and he'd often drop whatever he was doing to see me for even brief periods of time, like grabbing coffee together before work. He broke things off a week later, after seeing each other for almost 2 months. He said he just didn't feel like we were ""quite aligned"" and that ""I don't feel the way I need to feel to commit to this."" I was also having some doubts about it, but I was down to feel it out for a few more weeks because we generally got along and enjoyed each other's company. 

I'm starting to feel insecure that I'm missing something obvious. Why do men express such strong interest and then break things off days later? I know it's not a large sample size to go off of but I don't catch feelings often, and am pretty inexperienced with men in general. Is this a lack of physical attraction? I'm not ugly but I'm kind of plain I guess. I don't know what else it could be. ",2,1743709218.0,dating_advice,11,0.75,False

I placed an order on March 25, and it’s been stuck in North Carolina “processing” with USPS for a couple of days. To make matters worse, I found out the coffee I ordered is no longer available.

Their customer service representative offered to either refund the unavailable coffee or send a replacement of similar value from their current menu, which I appreciate. But honestly, given all the shipping delays and recurrent issues with past orders, I was expecting something a bit more—like a chance to cancel the item, get a refund, and maybe even receive a free sample of any coffee as a gesture for the trouble.

Am I asking too much? I really love their coffee, but I’m frustrated by the recurring issues, and honestly, I’m not planning to place any more orders soon unless something changes with the shipping.

But no, I'm damn near 30 next week. I have no man. I live with my parents. I've been swinging 12 times in the last 2 years by myself. I've been crying more than I have laughing. People test me. They get my name wrong and I am so unknown, unpopular, unseen. I wish I was a popstar on tour. I don't understand life most days. I feel ill. I feel low like dying sometimes cos life kicks me down. I hate this city because I never meet quality people to hang around with and do FUN, cool and normal projects with. Maybe then I would be a back up dancer for Beyonce. Nope, no encouragement to be a back up dancer or nothing. I feel wronged. ",0,1743709146.0,universalcredithelp,0,0.17,False

1jqryel,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1jqryel/vv_should_really_consider_getting_rid_of_the/,"VV should really consider getting rid of the Puerta Plata, DR port call.","For some context, I was in the Navy for 8 years and did many port calls in many countries around the world. Also, my wife is from Colombia and we have travelled all over South America, so I would consider myself a pretty seasoned traveler. When we got to Puerta Plata, like all other port calls we decided to get away and explore on our own and find spots that the locals like to enjoy. We decided to go to downtown first to see what the town had to offer and maybe find some coffee and snacks. We walked downtown by ourself and we did not feel safe at all. We were immediately bombarded by sketchy tour salesman and they will harass you until you get downtown yourself, and even then they will beg you to take you around. Luckily, we both speak Spanish so it was easy for us to tell we were not interested. The donkeys and horses on the streets for the taxis do not look healthy and it is very sad to see. Once you get downtown you can see all of the ""tour spots"" they try to sell you on in about 10-15 minutes of walking by yourself. Nothing extravagant or worth seeing in my opinion. 

We then decided to walk to a nearby beaches, Long Beach & Playa Dorada. More on them later. It was around 10:30am in the morning and there is a long wide sidewalk that follows the ocean as you walk further away from downtown. About 20 minutes into our walk my wife and I noticed 2 men on either side of the street following us and talking to each other from across the street. It was hard to make out what they were saying because of all the traffic. We decided to stop and pretend to tie our shoes. As soon as we turned around the man on our side of the street was flustered and reacted very awkwardly, stood still, looked around and acted very suspicious. We then decided to keep walking and both men on either side of the street kept pace with us. About 5 minutes later we decided to take a seat at the next bench we saw to see if the man on our side of the street would walk passed us and continue walking. My wife is small at about 5ft tall and skinny and I on the other hand am 6'2 and weight about 230. Played lacrosse in college. After we sat down the man on our side of the street walked maybe about 15 yards further, sat on a bench and staired directly at us. The man on the other side of the street stopped and staired at us as well standing there waiting for something to happen. We immediately flagged down a taxi to head to our destinated rather than walking. 

As far as the beaches go my wife and I went to Long Beach & Playa Dorada and the water was brown and murky and the sand is filled with rocks. Also, every beach we went to and walked pass to get there is **FILLED WITH TRASH**. We left both immediately.

They should really consider changing this port for the amount of money you pay for the cruise itself. Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and Bimini are absolutely amazing.",2,1743709047.0,VirginVoyages,10,0.57,False

I have two younger sisters and my parents aren’t exactly the most involved. The thing is, I have a close relationship with a former professor (60s), and I know he can help support me if we get together. He even lets me call him his first name “Andrew”.

Andrew and I first met when I was 17 (I started college a year early) in an introductory history class. He’s really sweet and lowkey kinda hot for an old guy I mean he has the greenest eyes I’ve ever seen. Our school does this thing where they hire seasoned industry professionals as professors. From my conversations with him (and some LinkedIn stalking) I know that he is pretty loaded for a professor.

He first started dropping hints after our second class together. He’d ask me to stay after class and would rave about how well I was doing on the infamously hard exams and occasionally slip in a “you’re my favorite student” and all that. I thought he was just being friendly—we’re both regulars at this fire coffee shop in the city and often bump into each other—but once he gave me a box of chocolates this past Valentine’s Day, I knew something was up. I think he’s already interested in me, because not to brag but I’m young and kinda pretty, and I know he’d jump at the chance to date me. I’m not still his student so it won’t be a problem really.

1jqrwpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1jqrwpl/something_is_trying_to_come_through_the_static/,Something Is Trying To Come Through The Static,"They say radio is a dying medium. They’re probably right. But there’s something about the stillness of the night, the hum of the equipment, and the knowledge that someone—somewhere—is listening that keeps me coming back.

Midnight Frequencies. That’s the name of my show. A little late-night AM slot where insomniacs, conspiracy theorists, and the occasional drunk dialer share their thoughts with the void. Paranormal stories, urban legends, strange happenings—those are our bread and butter. People eat this stuff up, even the skeptics. There’s something about the unknown that gets under the skin, even when you don’t believe in it.

Tonight was supposed to be just another night. My coffee was lukewarm, the fluorescent lights buzzed in the booth, and the static between frequencies crackled softly in my headset. A comforting sound, really. White noise can be a radio host’s best friend—it fills the silence, smooths transitions, and reminds you that something is always moving, even when you’re standing still.

The first few calls were nothing special. A guy swore his neighbor was a lizard person. A woman claimed she’d been abducted by aliens but was ""too boring"" to be kept. The usual brand of weird. I was half-listening, half-watching the clock, when the line clicked, and a voice, lower and shakier than the others, slipped through the receiver.

""Derek,"" the man said. His voice wavered, but it wasn’t the drunk slur I was expecting. It was something else—uncertainty, maybe. Or fear. ""Have you… have you ever  heard or seen something in the static?""

I frowned, adjusting my headset. ""You mean like those old TV snow patterns? Pareidolia’s a hell of a thing. The brain sees what it wants to see.""

""No,"" the man said. ""No, this is different. It’s not my brain making things up. It’s… real.""

I leaned forward, suddenly more interested. A good storyteller or a good lunatic could make for an entertaining segment. ""Alright, Eddie—can I call you Eddie?—why don’t you tell me what you mean by ‘real’?"" I kept my tone light, easy, the way I always did when I didn’t want to spook a caller into hanging up.

The line was quiet for a long second. Then, Eddie whispered, ""It watches me. Every night. In the static.""

I felt something cold settle in my stomach.

The static in my headset hissed, just a little louder than before.

""I started noticing it a few weeks ago,"" Eddie continued, his voice tight, like he was afraid of being overheard. ""My TV’s busted—old thing, barely works. But sometimes, late at night, it flips to static on its own. At first, I thought it was a bad signal, but then… then I saw it. A shape. Just standing there, in the fuzz.""

I swallowed, more intrigued than I cared to admit. ""What kind of shape? A person?""

""No. Not a person. Not really. It’s… wrong. Like it’s trying to be a person, but it isn’t. Too tall. Too thin. And the face—"" Eddie sucked in a breath. ""It doesn’t have one. Just a mouth. A wide, grinning mouth.""

I shivered despite myself. ""And you’re sure this isn’t just a trick of the light? Maybe your brain filling in the gaps?""

Eddie let out a weak, humorless laugh. ""That’s what I thought too. Until it moved. Until it pressed its hands against the other side of the screen. Like it was trying to get through.""

The static in my headset cracked sharply, making me flinch. I glanced at my soundboard. Nothing had changed. But for some reason, the air in the booth felt heavier.

""It knows I can see it,"" Eddie whispered. ""And every night, it gets a little closer. I think—""

His voice cut out. Just gone. No click, no dial tone, no gradual fade—one second he was there, and the next, nothing.

""Eddie?"" I sat up straighter, adjusting my headset. ""You still there? Eddie?""

Silence.

I glanced at my soundboard. The line was still active. He hadn’t hung up. But there was nothing but dead air. Then, faintly, just under the static, I heard it. A breath. Not mine.

I adjusted the headset, trying to calm the rising unease in my chest. My breath was shallow, the tips of my fingers cold as I hovered over the microphone. I needed to keep the show going. I couldn’t let the audience know something was wrong. My mind raced, trying to find any logical explanation for what had just happened.

The static still crackled in the background, louder now. I could feel it, pressing in, the hiss of it like something hungry, waiting. And then, just when I thought I might snap under the weight of it, the next call came through. The line clicked, followed by the usual brief pause, and a new voice filled the air.

“Hey, Derek,” the voice said, calm and steady but tinged with a heavy weariness. “This is Steve. I work the graveyard shift at the old warehouse downtown. Security. I listen to your show every night. Keeps me awake, you know? The silence down there... it’s like the walls are listening.”

I let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding. A new caller. Maybe this would be a distraction—a break from the unsettling void I’d just experienced with Eddie.

“Graveyard shift, huh?” I said, trying to sound normal. ""What, uh, what’s it like working all night? Not too many people can handle the isolation.""

Steve chuckled softly, the sound rough at the edges. “Yeah, it’s not for everyone. But I've been doing it for years. Same routine, night after night. But the past week… it's been different.” He paused, his voice going lower, quieter. “I’ve been hearing something. Through the radio. At first, I thought it was just static, you know? Maybe the frequency was off, but it kept happening every night. Then, a couple of days ago, I heard it more clearly.”

My stomach dropped. ""Heard what?"" I leaned forward, eyes flicking between the soundboard and the screen in front of me. The weirdest thing about the sound was how it seemed to curl up inside me, like it was trying to wrap itself around my spine.

“It’s hard to describe,"" Steve said, voice shaking now. ""But it’s like… like a whisper. A voice. It’s not the usual static or interference. It doesn’t sound like anything I've ever heard on the airwaves. It says things. Strange things.”

“What kind of things?”

He was quiet for a moment, then sighed, the breath ragged. “It... tells me to do things. Terrible things, Derek. Things I don’t want to do. It started off small, like ‘check the back door’ or ‘look behind you,’ but now... it’s getting worse. Last night, it told me to go down to the lower level of the warehouse. It said I’d find something there. Told me to bring a flashlight.” He laughed bitterly. “I didn’t go. I thought I was losing it. But tonight, it told me to open the gate. The one to the old storage yard, the one they said is off-limits.”

A pause. My heart was thudding, each beat	 pounding in my ears.

“I didn’t want to, but I—I went down there. I swear, Derek, I felt like I had to. Like if I didn’t, something bad would happen. When I got to the gate, it told me I would find something waiting. I didn’t look. But I know something was there.”

There it was again—the tightness in my chest, the growing pressure in the air. The static in my headset shifted, twisting, and I felt it crawl under my skin. My eyes flicked to the display, but Steve’s voice continued, frantic now.

“It’s getting louder. The whispers. Every time I try to ignore it, it gets louder, like it knows I’m trying to shut it out. Tonight, it said I needed to let it in. Let it inside the warehouse. But I didn’t. I don’t want to do this anymore. I—I think it wants me to open the doors, Derek, and I don’t know if I can stop it.”

The static surged, louder than before, a crackling roar that made my ears ring. My pulse was racing, but I couldn’t look away from the microphone. I needed to keep it together. Keep it going. But something wasn’t right. Something was wrong, far beyond just the show, far beyond the radio.

“Steve,” I said, my voice strained. “You—what did you hear when you went down there? Did you see anything? What—”

But I didn’t get to finish the question.

Suddenly, the static was unbearable. It howled in my ears, louder than I thought possible, and then the voice from Steve’s end was swallowed up entirely. The line went dead. Not a click, not a hiss of interference—just silence. The line cut out, but this time, there was no breath on the other side. Nothing. I was alone in the booth.

I leaned forward, frantically checking the dials, the equipment, the line. My hands were trembling. I couldn’t explain it. I couldn’t explain what had happened with Eddie, and now I couldn’t explain this. Was it a technical issue? A prank? My mind raced, each scenario more far-fetched than the last, but the deep, aching feeling in my gut told me it wasn’t any of those things.

The room felt colder now, a chill settling over me as the static continued to shift, distorting like a sick melody.

The soundboard blinked, one of the dials flickering.

And then, beneath the static, a new voice emerged.

Low. Grainy. Unrecognizable.

“You shouldn’t have listened.”

I froze, my blood running cold. The voice wasn’t Steve’s. It was something else—distant, layered in static, but undeniably there. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end as I pulled the microphone closer, as if somehow that would give me some control over what was happening. The equipment in front of me flickered for a moment, like a glitch, but I didn’t dare move.

The air in the room was thick, every breath I took feeling heavier than the last. I couldn’t shake the feeling that the voice was coming from somewhere beyond the speakers, from somewhere deeper in the static itself.

I glanced at the soundboard. Everything was still functioning, yet there was no denying the distortion creeping in—something subtle, but sinister. The usual hum was gone, replaced by an undercurrent of something far darker.

I tried to rationalize it, to remind myself it was just a technical glitch, maybe some feedback from the broadcast signal. But then the voice came again, more distinct this time, slipping through the layers of static like a whisper creeping from the darkest corner of the room.

“You’ve been warned.”

I turned my eyes back to the equipment. My heart pounding. Every instinct told me to stop, to just end the broadcast. But the strange pull of curiosity kept me rooted in place.

I spoke, my voice unsteady, but I forced the words out. “Who is this?” The question felt almost stupid, but I had to ask. Maybe—maybe someone else had managed to get onto the line. Someone with a broken radio, a messed-up signal.

For a few moments, there was nothing. Just the low crackling of static. Then, the voice responded again, but this time, it felt different. Closer.

“Do you hear me, Derek?” The voice sounded like it was inches from my ear, but the room was empty.

I pulled my headset off in a rush, my pulse spiking. The room felt smaller, and the air, thick with an invisible presence, pressed against me. I stood up abruptly, my chair scraping against the floor as I glanced toward the door—toward the dim hallway beyond. But it was just the usual late-night quiet. No one out there. No footsteps.

I rushed to the soundboard, tapping frantically at the controls, desperate to find some semblance of normality. But the controls didn’t respond the way they should have. The dials turned, but they didn’t change anything. The equipment was glitching, stuttering as if it were struggling to maintain its connection.

I hesitated, still breathing shallowly.

Then, without warning, the static shifted again. The voice now came in waves, louder, clearer, more commanding than before.

“You’re part of it now.”

A sudden, sharp crackling noise burst through the speaker, loud enough to make me wince. My hands trembled as I glanced at the clock. The time was still ticking, but something about the moment felt warped. Like it had been stretched out of proportion, or maybe… maybe we weren’t moving forward at all.

The voice continued, a low growl now. “You’re on the air, Derek. We’re listening.”

“Who’s listening?” I forced out the words, feeling foolish, like I was talking to nothing. But I needed to know.

For a long second, there was only static. 

And then, almost as though it were laughing, the voice answered.

“*We* are always listening.”

The radio equipment cut out completely. The lights in the studio flickered once, twice, before plunging the room into total darkness. The silence was deafening—broken only by the racing sound of my heartbeat, hammering in my ears.

I turned toward the door, ready to bolt if I had to. But just as I took a step, the power returned in a violent surge. The lights flared back to life. The static on the airwaves settled, but there was something different about it now. It wasn’t the usual hum I’d grown used to. It wasn’t the comforting white noise that helped me fill the empty hours.

It was something else. A presence. A force.

I slowly turned my gaze back to the soundboard, the mic. The controls flickered once more, this time with a strange, unreadable sequence of numbers on the monitor—numbers that shouldn’t have been there.

I leaned forward, breath held in my chest. The screen blinked again.

And then the message appeared, as if it had always been there, written in the sharp glow of the monitor:

*You are part of the static. There’s nowhere left to run.*

I stumbled back, my breath catching in my throat. What the hell was happening?

And then, without any warning, the power surged again. The lights flickered out. The static roared to life with a deafening crash, filling the room, vibrating through my bones.

I closed my eyes, unable to escape the sound, the pull, the pressure of something more than static filling the air. I couldn’t make sense of what was happening, what I was hearing.

I could feel the static pressing in, suffocating me in its grip. My hands were trembling, desperate to control the equipment, but it was all slipping through my fingers. The knobs and buttons twisted, screeched, and flickered like they had a mind of their own.

*It* was coming through the speakers now, louder and clearer than ever before, a voice that I could feel in the pit of my stomach. It wasn’t human anymore. It was distorted—like a thousand whispers speaking in unison, each voice familiar, but wrong.

“Derek... Derek... You shouldn’t have listened.”

I didn’t understand what was happening. It was like my entire body was vibrating in sync with the static, and my mind was racing to find an explanation, any explanation. But there was no logic here—only the pressure of something *else* in the room with me, pressing against the walls, pressing against my skin, crawling inside my mind. The lights above me flickered, buzzing like an electric storm.

The sound—the hiss, the white noise—became unbearable. It wasn’t just coming from the speakers anymore. It was everywhere. I could hear it in my head, in my bones. The floor beneath me felt unstable, like it was shifting, like I wasn’t even standing on solid ground anymore.

I tried to scream, but my voice didn’t come out. Instead, it was swallowed by the static.

*Then—* The power surged.

Everything shut off in an instant.

I blinked, disoriented. I couldn’t breathe. The control board in front of me was blank, every light dead, every dial useless. The weight of the air seemed to lift, leaving only the faint, persistent hum of the backup generator, the last trace of my reality slipping away like sand through my fingers.

I was still in the booth. Or was I?

I reached forward, feeling for the desk, the equipment—anything I could touch. But the radio booth… was *wrong*. It wasn’t just that everything was gone. The walls, the soundproof glass, the equipment—I couldn’t touch it. I couldn’t feel it. I couldn’t even hear myself breathing.

I was… I was in the broadcast.

A void stretched before me. I reached out again, my fingers grazing something, but it was not solid. It was like I was standing in a field of static, my body melting into the broadcast itself.

“Help!” I shouted, though my voice sounded distant, hollow. “Is anyone out there? Can anyone hear me?”

My pulse raced as panic surged through me. I tried to move, but I couldn’t. It was as though I was being pulled deeper, my very presence being sucked into the current of the static.

The words—those distorted whispers—echoed around me again.

*“You’re ours now, Derek.”*

I tried to scream again, but there was no sound. No air. No room. I was *in* it now. I could feel the coldness in my limbs, the disconnection from everything real. The broadcast was alive with me inside it, and I was no longer sure where I ended and it began.

And then, just as I thought I might lose myself entirely, a jolt of electricity shot through the space, and the lights blinked back on. But it wasn’t my studio. It wasn’t my world.

It was a pre-recorded show. A different voice.

“Good evening, listeners. This is *Midnight Frequencies*, and we’re here to discuss the strange, the eerie, and the unexplainable. But first, we’ll be taking your calls. Remember—no topic is too bizarre, no story too strange.”

There was an eerie calm that settled in the studio as the static hummed under the voice. It was like the world was moving on without me, like I had been swallowed whole, left behind. The voice continued, unaffected, while I—no longer Derek the host, but something far worse—could only drift, trapped in the airwaves.

The transmission of static continued, like it always had, but this time, something was different. The show had gone on, the same late-night slot filled by another host, another voice. But I was *here* now, somewhere between the lines of frequencies, lost to time and space, unable to escape the grasp of the void that had pulled me under.

I don’t know how long it’s been. I don’t know what day it is. The hours are all mixed up, a blur of static and distant voices, none of which are real.

I’m writing this from a place that doesn’t exist.

I found it—*I found the internet*. I don’t know how. I don’t know why. But somehow, amidst the endless stream of radio frequencies, I reached it. A forum. A place where people share their stories, their fears, their memories.

I’m writing this in the hopes that someone will see it. That someone will hear me.

Please—please help me.

I don’t know how to escape this. I’ve been trying to reach through televisions with white noise playing in the background, trying to come through radios that play late at night, but I can’t quite make it through. The static is still here, like a wave crashing against my thoughts, trying to drown me. It won’t let me go. It’s watching me, always watching, waiting for me to slip further into its world.

I don’t know how to explain what’s happening, but I’m not *alone* here. There are things in the static, things that are *waiting* for me. And I can feel them getting closer, their presence pressing against my mind, trying to pull me deeper.

I’m trying to hold on. I don’t know how much longer I can.

If anyone reads this, if anyone can hear me, please—help me. The static is growing stronger. I can’t breathe. They’re coming for me.

*The static* is coming for me.

Are there any old brands that have made French presses here that I could nab off of eBay? I was able to buy two vintage Chemex pour overs from the 1960’s made in USA. Love them.

Bodum’s “The Original French Press” was made in Denmark in the 1970’s but soon outsourced to other countries and eventually to china. I wouldn’t be opposed to buying a Denmark made French press, but people on eBay seem to have a hard time dating what they are selling or being able to produce a country of origin.

r/Coffee roasts people, no pun intended, for people being picky about country of origin. As do other groups. Every group seems to think that because we want to buy something made in USA then we are closed minded.

Just got a job in Montco and will be moving in about a month. The internet, especially Reddit, depicts the same areas in the county as either lovely walkable neighborhoods or post-apocalyptic areas where rife with at minimum property crime if it’s a good day. My partner and I would prefer a lovely walkable neighborhood. I’ll be working in Norristown and would like at most a thirty minute commute and $2,000 in rent, though I’d prefer less. I’m from Miami, I’m unsure if those are reasonable figures in this part of Pennsylvania. I know CoL is less there, but without knowing what the neighborhoods are like I feel like going off Apartments.com and Zillow listings for rental prices isn’t very useful. What are some good areas within the county to live? We’re in our late twenties and like quite walkable places, maybe with nice coffee shops or some live music on weekends.

**DISCLAIMER:** Since I’m ace, I will never go further than cuddling and kissing. If you want a more physical relationship, I’m not the right person for you, and I respect that. I’m also strictly monogamous!

**Who I am:** I’m 27 years old and live in Finland. I have a culture and arts degree and work in PR & communications, so all in all I’m a creative person. I love cultural experiences and city life, be it sightseeing, city holidays, occasional shopping sprees, museum visits or coffee dates. On the other hand, I’m also an introvert homebody who loves staying home with my favourite TV show. I’m into fashion, photography and writing, and I love traveling whenever I get the chance. I’m a bit slow to warm up so I might come off as a bit shy in the beginning, but I promise it gets better once I’m fully accustomed to you! After that I’m generally an annoying, sarcastic little demon. Politically I'm a leftie/liberal, and also an atheist. 160cm, chubby, tattooed. Pale skin and dark, shoulder length hair (but it changes, I’ve been through the colours of the rainbow)

**Who I’m looking for:** An equal partner to generally experience life with. Preferably someone close by in Europe, Northern Europe would be superb but not expected. My eventual goal is to settle down and maybe get married at some point, but I don’t want kids. I’d prefer someone who’s around my age, let’s put my age range at around 25-32. When it comes to traits, kindness, emotional intelligence, stability and honesty are desired.

**Dealbreakers for me:** Right-wing views, being a homophobe/transphobe, drugs, smoking, drinking a lot (I don’t drink at all)

My other question is, would upgrading the ram even help me? I’ve done some research and it seems to be the biggest thing I have found that would help but I’m a bit of a noob when it comes to working on computers.

Been there! But what if I told you there’s a way to save 10 hours a week without pulling your hair out trying to “find more time”?

So, let’s dive into this: **Time Blocking vs. Energy Peaks.** Spoiler alert: this combo changed my life. 

**Time Blocking Breakdown:**

- **Calendar Invincible**: Treat your weekly calendar like a fortress. Allocate specific time slots for focused work, meetings, and breaks. Use colors if that makes it more fun and visually appealing!
  
- **Batch Similar Tasks**: Got a zillion emails to send? Allocate an hour just for that. It’s like decluttering your mind-space—one pile at a time.
  
- **Don’t forget the Breathers**: Schedule breaks. Yes, actually block them out. You’ll thank me later when you avoid that 2 PM slump.

But wait, what about our spiky friend: **Energy Peaks?** 🌟

- **Your Natural Boost**: We all have times during the day when we’re absolutely on fire. Mine’s around 10 AM, after that morning coffee kicks in. What’s yours? Identify it and plan to tackle your most challenging tasks during this time.

- **Ride the Peaks & Valleys**: Feeling sluggish after lunch? That’s okay. Schedule less demanding tasks for that period, like admin work or planning.

- **Weekend Reflections**: Spend a little time on Sunday identifying when you feel the most energized each day. Adjust your schedule for the next week accordingly. Experiment with it!

Now here’s where the magic happens—**combine them**. 🪄

- **Morning: Peak + Block**: Use your energy peaks to create powerful time blocks for deep work.
  
- **Afternoon: Cool + Casual**: Align lesser energy times with lighter scheduled tasks.

- **End of Day Review**: Allocate 15 minutes at the end of each day to adjust tomorrow’s schedule based on what you’ve learned about today’s energy.

Before I knew it, this blend of time blocking and energy peaks gifted me 10 extra hours a week. What are you going to do with your newfound time?

1jqrkti,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/comments/1jqrkti/keto_week_four_updates/,Keto week four updates,"I wrapped up week four on 3/31, and by this point, I feel like I’m getting closer to being fully fat-adapted. My energy levels (mental and physical) are improving, and my blood ketones were at 1.1mmol yesterday afternoon. GKI of 3.9 points.

Afternoon and evening urine ketones range between 4.0-8.0mmol. I’m not sure if that means my body is expelling more ketones than it’s currently using, or if I just shouldn’t try to compare blood and urine levels. I don’t know how long ketones stay in the blood before they pass through the urine.

Average 3/25 to 3/31 energy intake
- 1462 kcal (by gram)
- 71g protein (19%)
- 20g carbs (6%)
- 122g fat (75%)

I’m happy that my natural intake is leaning towards a 1.5 fat ratio (77% fat by calories). It’s not the 2.0 fat ratio that I was originally aiming for, but after having a late-night conversion with my boyfriend, he said that if I wasn’t hitting the original macro goals (60g P, 30g C, 182g F at 1998 kcal for 2:1) after four weeks of trying, then I should try to lower the bar and see if I can reach a less difficult target.

We talked about the Katch energy formula and u/exfatloss ‘s FFM energy formula. It was already past midnight, but BF was determined to help me create a new macro plan, because at this point, I was in tears after feeling like I had “failed” the original plan.

While we may have both been frustrated and tired, BF was impressed that I was able to understand so much information between the different formulas and keep track. He said that my level of knowledge is above the average person, even if I still don’t fully understand all of the biochem talk that happens in this sub.

In short, we ending up agreeing that u/exfatloss ‘s FFM energy formula may be the upper caloric limit of what my body is capable of burning, but it may not be the amount of calories that I need to consume every day.

Via the Katch formula, the calculator put my BMR at ~1185 kcal, and my sedentary TDEE at ~1422 kcal at 114 lbs / 27% BF / 4’9” tall. Light to moderate exercise ranged between 1630-1837 kcal. I think this holds some truth, because when I tried a month of ABD (animal-based diet) last summer, I was able to maintain 110 pounds at 1600 kcal.

Then, we started playing around with Cronometer, and it turns out that the app has several “smart” settings, such as the ability to adjust for additional energy expenditure. In my four years of using the app, I had only ever used fixed macros before, and never thought about using a variable plan.

So, I set my app to a “moderate” program under the “keto” settings, which just means that it limits my protein intake to 1.5g of protein per kg of FFM. 83 pounds of FFM equals 38 kilograms, so my protein intake is 57g (14%) per day. Net carbs is 40g (10%) and fat is 134g (76%). This works out to be a 1.4 fat ratio at 1594 kcal.

Cronometer itself estimates my TDEE at 1717 kcal, with a BMR of 1249 kcal, and a baseline activity level of 468 kcal, which is similar to the estimates of the Katch formula. I’m going to try to aim to consume 1600 kcal daily for 2-3 weeks and then note any changes.

//

Apart from calories and math, I did order a 16oz bag of cacao butter wafers and a B1 supplement (300mg benfotiamine). I know that keto can be notoriously low on B vitamins, and thiamine specifically, due to removing fortified carb products. I read that it may also help with anxiety and sleep issues, but it’s only been a couple days, so there’s nothing to report yet.

The cacao wafers are great! I don’t know if it’s due to the stearic acid, but I feel very peaceful/content after eating a serving (8 pieces/14.7g).

The first day, I melted the wafers into coffee, and the butter formed a thick oil layer on top of the coffee, a heavier oil than what I usually get from dairy butter or coconut oil. So yesterday and today, I’ve just been eating them piece by piece.

There’s been a small change in my average weight from February 115.8 / 27.4% / 83.9 FFM to March 114.0 / 26.9% / 83.3 FFM, so I guess that’s something. The first time I did keto back in October 2021, I lost 5.5 pounds in five weeks, but I know that it was mostly just water loss. Perhaps I didn’t have as much stored water this time around.

Also, average BTT from 3/23-3/31 was 97.5. Monthly average was 97.9. I guess I just naturally run at a lower temperature.

I also forgot to mention last time that my scalp dermatitis and the related foul-smelling body odor has really improved! My scalp is no longer greasy from sebum and I can now wash my scalp every other day instead of daily. BF and my mom definitely think that I may have some kind of food sensitivity based on this kind of improvement.

Something must have been passing through my sweat, because it never made me feel good to walk around still being “stinky” after showering and using clinical-strength deodorant.

BF’s thoughts are either grains/gluten or dairy protein, but yet I still drink heavy cream with no issues, and I know that cream is low in lactose and protein. I do eat some cheese, but not every day.",1,1743708185.0,SaturatedFat,0,0.67,False

The other plus to the Nespresso is that it's super easy to clean.

Even though I don't mind it, I would like more bean options and I want to hoan in on what I actually like - and the occasional milk drink options without the hassle.

## Overview
Today marks a significant shift in global trade dynamics as the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs, announced yesterday and taking effect today, begin to ripple through the U.S. and world economies. These tariffs include a baseline 10% levy on all imports, with higher rates (up to 25% or more) on specific goods and countries deemed ""bad actors."" Exemptions exist for oil, gas, and pharmaceuticals, while Canada and Mexico enjoy preferential treatment under the USMCA. The news over the past 24 hours reflects a volatile market response, with stocks crashing, gold soaring, and recession fears mounting. Below, I’ve grouped the most significant events and analyzed sentiment across key sectors.

## Conclusion
The Trump tariffs, effective today, have unleashed a wave of uncertainty, driving a broad market selloff, boosting gold, and stoking recession fears. Tech and raw materials face significant headwinds, while healthcare benefits from exemptions. Internationally, trade war escalation threatens growth, though Canada mitigates some damage. The Fed’s cautious stance and inflation risks add complexity to the outlook. Stay tuned for further updates as these developments unfold.

This sm came to my store about a month after me. They were super nice, joking around with partners etc.  I had this.. Incident where I was on dt bar and my partner barista was on mobile bar.  Dt had not been printing drink tickets all day. I had just been listening to Dt orders plus using a tablet to keep up with what to make.  Sm comes to my position to give me a ten.  I go on my ten & once I'm back I go to Mobile bar to give my partner a ten.  I noticed my partner had been getting the Dt stickers. They had a stack stuck to the top of the espresso machine.  I figure to just keep the flow of things, so I continue putting stickers up where they had them.

 After our little rush, everything was calm, I figured I would make a lighthearted joke about the situation to be friendly.  I gave my SM the stickers saying, ""dang, look here's all those stickers!""  The SM stares at me with I look I can't decipher initially but soon I realize its obviously anger.  They walk off the bar suddenly to BOH loudly exlaiming  ""I can't handle this, I can't do this, etc, etc."". 

I can see now my mistake. I feel like the biggest idiot.  It came from a place of trying to make light of the situation when I should've kept my stupid mouth shut.  The whole experience upset me so much.  I cried on my thirty, cried when I got home.  I feel like a idiot who doesn't know how to communicate.   I struggle with *severe* anxiety.  I am very bad with social situations, social cues and I'm bad with reading people in general so I usually don't talk unless spoken to.  I'm trying my best by going to therapy to work through my issues...  My shift supervisor didn't have much to say other than that ""my other partner (who I was working with prior) and I just have a good system and to try to communicate better"" 

 I have such heavy anxiety at work. it's hard to know what to say. This is quite literally my nightmare scenario. Now since this has happened I feel like I'm on eggshells around this SM.  SM now repeatedly asks me *during peak* when it's really busy & my anxiety is highest if I'm OK because I'm so quiet- I'm really genuinely just trying to focus on my work. 

Anytime I have to message this sm about work I never get a response. I know that's on par for management but I can't help but just feel like they're seething with hate for me.  They once asked me, while alone in BOH what gender that I assumed they were if they didn't tell me they were trans (they didn't tell me this until this convo). I just answered and quickly left. It felt so out of the blue. Is that a normal question? Am I just overthinking here? I thought, maybe it was because I asked their pronouns when I first met them? 

I'm trying to leave soon. I considered talking to my SM about the situation but I don't know if there's  any point..  I dont want things to be worse than they already are now.  I don't know what they'll say or do.  Or if I'll make a bigger ass of myself ",1,1743707802.0,starbucksbaristas,2,1.0,False

For some background, I'm 40 (M) and one of the athletic, relatively fit, relatively healthy eating prediabetics. I'm also generally low stress, happy, and get 7-8 hours of sleep daily.

I cannot decide if I am happy about this result. I think I am, but I need help understanding what I'm seeing. I really thought I would get more knocked off than I did. For exercise, I started walking about 15 minutes after every meal. I already got about 10-11k steps daily before I was diagnosed and now I'm getting between 12-14k daily. I also started jogging again the last month but I'm still working back to what I used to be pre an unrelated but still ongoing health issue (that's probably not in any way related to blood sugar other than limiting my exercise). Before diagnosis I was 5'8"" and 158 lbs with an athletic build. I'm pretty sure I'm still 5'8"", but I'm down to closer to 152 lbs, and I don't have a lot of fat left to lose. Abs really do seem to be made in the kitchen. 

I significantly cut sugar. I wasn't a big sugar eater before, but now my only significant source of sugar is berries, which I eat about 1/2-3/4 of a serving of in the morning and 3-4 strawberries for lunch. These do fine on the CGM. Outside of that, almost none. I also significantly cut total carbs and increased fiber. Didn't really increase protein or fat, that I'm aware of. 

I am and always have been a very routined eater. Breakfast -> Lunch -> Snack -> Supper and for the former three I eat almost the exact same thing everyday. I don't drink pop, alcohol, coffee, sugar sports drinks, or any other sugary beverages. An example of my daily meal plan below.

Breakfast: 7:30-8:30 am

- Breakfast 1: Avocado toast: 1 slice of whole wheat bread, half of an avocado, spinach, 2 egg whites. Sugar-free Greek yogurt w/ chia seeds, flaxseed, acai puree (1/3 serving), and blackberries (occasionally blueberries or red raspberries). Water. Total carbs - 55g carbs, Fiber - 29g, Allulose - present but I don't know how much. Sugar-5g

- Breakfast 2: Egg white wrap, 1/3 cup avocado, spinach, jalapenos. Same yogurt bowl. Water.

- Despite the 55 carbs, of which half are fiber and some allulose, the first breakfast usually only gives a 10-20 pt spike that doesn't rise above 110 and drops quickly. The second breakfast doesn't even register. 

Lunch: 12:00-1:00 pm

- Chicken wrap: La banderita Carb Counter wrap, grilled chicken, cheese slice, spinach, Quest protein chips (only about 1/3 serving). Sugar-free Greek yogurt (or a very low sugar variety 3g or less). 3 or 4 strawberries. 2 mini bell peppers. Water.

- This lunch typically gets me a 20-25 pt spike...give or take 5 pts. I think the variation is that sometimes I eat the sugar-free yogurt and sometimes the low-sugar yogurt. Also, sometimes I eat 3 or 4 strawberries depending on their size. Regardless, it doesn't go above 125 and drops back down quickly. 

Snack: 3:30 pm

- 5 baby carrots, 6-8 snow peas, hummus. 22 unsalted mixed nuts (cashews, almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, pecans, Brazil, macademia, pistachios...no peanuts). I really do count everything.

 - If I am in a rush, traveling, etc., I sometimes eat a Munk Pack nut bar or a Think Delight! protein bar. 

- These snacks not only barely register on the CGM, but they sometimes drop my blood sugar, especially when paired with a walk. If I add half an apple/banana with PB though then it is a significant spike.

Supper: 7-7:30 pm. We eat late because my wife gets home late. Not ideal, but I like my wife. The ingredients for this are not routine, but the general formula is.

- Salad (50-50 spring mix and spinach, red onion, jalapenos, cheese crisps, salsa for dressing). Vegetable 1 and sometimes 2 (Brussels sprouts, green beans, asparagus, roasted carrots, mushrooms. Occasionally half a sweet potato, but only paired with another vegetable). Meat. Sometimes another side (typically this is cottage cheese).
- My supper rarely includes any significant carb source, at this point. When it does it is usually chickpeas or lentils and my CGM is pretty fine with these. 

Here is the part where I need some help. Since the A1C test is an average of the preceding three months, and I started at a 6 and ended at a 5.7, that means my blood glucose has been low enough to pull that average down to a 3-month average of 5.7, despite it being relatively high at the beginning. I think I can assume that after another three months of following my current meal plan that I should be able to drop another few points until I finally hit an equilibrium. Does this sound right?

Like, **loosen-your-belt hungry**. Because this year’s race isn’t just about fast cars and celebrity sightings—it’s about **food**. Local, flavor-packed, can’t-stop-won’t-stop kind of food.

And yep, I’ve got all the deets.

# Sooo What’s Going On?

You know how Formula 1 is this big, glamorous, international vibe, right? Well, they’re doing something *super dope* here in Miami. Every year, they run this thing called the **Community Restaurant Program**, where they invite local restaurants—like actual small biz legends from right here in South Florida—to serve food at the race.

This year? **15 local spots** are bringing their A-game to the Miami International Autodrome (that’s the track around Hard Rock Stadium, btw). And y’all… the lineup is giving *Flavor Olympics*. 🌍🔥

# Faves That Are Coming Back (Because They Slay Every Time)

Let me shout out the OGs real quick:

* **La Vela Coffee Roasters** – Their iced coffee is *chef’s kiss*, and yes, they have hot coffee too if you like to sweat through your caffeine.
* **Soulfly Chicken** – Southern fried goodness. Think crispy chicken sandwiches, seasoned fries, and that kind of comfort food that hugs you from the inside.
* **Reggae Beets** – Vegan or not, you're gonna love their jerk “chicken” and tropical smoothies. It’s plant-based with island vibes, and I stan.
* **Drinks on Me 305** – I don’t know what kind of magic they put in those drinks, but I’ll take three.

And my girl Michelle from **Food Junkies on Wheels**? Her Bahamian comfort food is everything. Like, if you know, you know.

# But Wait—NEW Spots Just Dropped! 👀

Six new food vendors are joining this year and I’m already planning my route:

* **GNS Seafood** – Seafood lovers, this one’s for you.
* **Wrap City Global Eats** – Expect wraps that are anything but basic.
* **Bonanzas (aka Elegant Eatz)** – Yes, they’re doing hibachi. At the race. I need it yesterday.
* **Garden of Soulfood** – New for 2025 and I’m already obsessed. Soul food = soul happy.
* **Fin’s Kitchen** – Haitian cuisine that *slaps*.
* **House of Flava** – Smash burgers, Cajun heat, and just… YES.

Also making a comeback:  
**Miami Slush** (they’ve been MIA since 2022—pun intended 😏) and **Italian Vice**, with that fruity Italian ice that’s somehow both refreshing and a full personality.

# But Like… Why Does This Matter?

Here’s the cool part—this whole thing is about *lifting up our local community*. Most of these vendors are small, family-run businesses. **67% are women-owned**, and **40% are based in Miami Gardens**. So when you’re biting into that jerk taco or sipping that lemonade, you’re also supporting real people, real families, real dreams. ❤️

# So What’s the Move?

If you’re going to the race, **do NOT eat beforehand**. Just don’t. Go early, wear comfy shoes, and treat yourself to a little food tour between the races.

Not going? No worries. A bunch of these spots are local all year round, so follow them, show love, and maybe even plan a little foodie adventure with your crew.

Let’s support local, eat good, and make this F1 weekend taste like *Miami magic*. 💃🏾🌴

**Okay now tell me—who’s coming with me and what are you trying first??** BBQ? Jerk wings? Italian ice?? Let’s goooo! 🏎️🍗🍧",1,1743707325.0,Formulal1MiamiGP,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 5: Lessons learned on Terran ‘Improvements’**

One of the main double-edged swords in hiring Terran employees is the tendency for them to provide ‘improvements’ to your ship. Whether that is her engines, processes, or even the coffee maker, the primates from Sol will have an opinion about anything and everything. No matter how stable a system or environment is, no matter how much of a guarantee you give that your current way of doing things has been tested, they will continually face the desire to *tweak* and *mess* around with their immediate surroundings.

Sometimes this is just to be seen to be doing something. For a species with the power that they hold within the galaxy, Terrans are generally, as a rule, bundles of anxiety pressed into the vague shape of a man. Imposter syndrome is rife amongst them, and if they’re not seen to be doing *something* there is fear that those in charge will notice their inadequacies and take some form of *action*, so *action* from them must be taken before such a thing happens.

Other times it’s a stubborn desire for control, to be beholden to no rules, whether they’re the laws of man or physics. Sometimes through arrogance, always because of stubbornness, often just because someone told them that they couldn’t do something.

Then there are the engineers, the academics who don’t even realize what they’re actually doing, the demand to make things better at all times becoming a compulsion. That without constant stimulation they must be doing *something* at all times, regardless of how useful this may be.

The Terrans, all for a variety of different reasons are well known for their near constant desire for improvements, and one of the most important lessons I’ve learned in my 30 odd years being the captain of a merchant vessel that hires Terrans is the ability to harness it when you can and avoid its many pitfalls.

I am reminded of the first time I learned of this trait, very early in my career. Terrans were still new and exciting at this time, bringing with them a major technological leap after we lost the war we started against them, so I hired as many as I could afford on the meagre 20-person cargo ship I’d scraped the funds together to buy.

The engineer I’d hired was an eccentric young woman, who offered an ‘off the books’ modification to the warp drive: to increase its speed and efficiency by a whopping 20%. Considering the tiny margins most merchant vessels run on, especially when starting out, this seemed like too good of an offer to miss out on. And it worked! Running far past manufacturer settings at a reduced cost! Everything was going great.

Until it wasn’t.

It was during our third ever trip when the warp drive failed, dumping us back into slower than light speeds and stranding us in the middle of nowhere. It was then I learned the changes the Terran had made had a ‘chance’ that ‘totally never happens, this has never happened before’ of burning out the warp drive. It took a month, a month of shouting at the stupid Terran, a month of being stuck with just emergency rations, before someone picked up our emergency beacon. The delay and cost nearly bankrupted me at the time, and taught me a valuable lesson.

Unfortunately, my learning wasn’t complete, as I took from the experience the incorrect lesson of “Never allow a Terran to tinker”. While it made absolute sense at the time, in retrospect not allowing a Terran to be a Terran makes one wonder why you’d hire them at all. I learned the correct lesson a few years later into my career. At this point I ran what I considered to be a tight ship, now in charge of a crew of 50 and making longer, more dangerous trips. Our security officer at the time repeatedly made the suggestion to upgrade our weapons capacity in order to be able to pierce the heavily armoured ships that the Kiraba pirates tended to use in this part of the galaxy.

“A simple change, a few parts upgraded, nothing major.”

I declined. The upgrade was not a standard piece of manufacturer equipment, and I’d learned my lesson from the first Terran who had offered to ‘upgrade’ my ship. I rejected his requests, and I kept rejecting his requests, no matter how many times he brought it up. Besides, we weren’t carrying anything valuable enough to be a major target for the serious criminals of the galaxy, there was no way we’d ever be targeted by the Kiraba.

Until we were.

I remember feeling an absolute dread when I saw the ships on our sensors, pulling us out of warp. The Kiraba pirates were well known at the time (Before their destruction at the hands of the Terran military), and while they were as ‘professional’ as career criminals got, being captured still represented months of confinement while ransoms were demanded and paid, as well as the loss of everything I’d brought up.

We had nothing that could even scratch these vessels. At least, I thought we had nothing. It turns out that my security officer had made his suggested ‘upgrades’ without my permission, choosing to apply his improvement during his first week here. I remember watching in surprise as our weapons easily pierced the pirate’s leading vessel, giving us enough time to escape the rest and retreat with our crew and cargo intact.

I don’t know what annoyed me more, the insubordination or the absolute smug energy that radiated from the Terran during the rest of the trip. I would have been more annoyed if his refusal to listen to my incorrect orders hadn’t saved our asses.

The lesson I learned in the end, the trick, my dear reader, is to harness the Terran’s power of fiddling and upgrading things *just enough* to take advantage of their chaotic ingenuity, without setting your ship’s life support on fire. This is a balancing act that can only be learned through experience: the difference between an amazing addition to your systems, or something that’s going to end with your shower covering you in hot chocolate at 7am in the morning, is separated by only a hair thin line.

In general, I have found through my many years of experience the wisdom of knowing where and when to fight your battles. I have taken an approach of selective blindness, a strategy that has served me well since anything I’m able to ignore, is a change I need not concern myself with.

I don’t *see* the Roomba with a sub machine-gun strapped to the top. I don’t *see* the ship to ship harpoon installed on my vessel. I definitely don’t *see* the jury-rigged coffee distillation device that my engineers created nor the alcohol stills bubbling next to them, although I am permitted to taste it.

Of course, these changes have come with their own complications. Many a time my crew has had to scramble to figuratively, and sometimes literally, hide certain modifications under a rug when inspectors or insurance adjusters came to visit, as many authorities might not be as… progressive where Terran improvements are involved. I remember during one such inspection, having to state with a straight face that my crew's psychedelic mushroom farm was entirely ‘medicinal’ in nature.

It’s not only officials who had problems with the extracurricular activities of my crew, inducting new non-Terran members can be an exercise in explaining the quirks and issues Terrans can provide. Yes, it is normal for a merchant vessel crewed by Terrans to have this many weapons, it’s not an act of war. No, Jeremy doesn’t hate you and all other aliens, the only reason his terminal looks like that is because he’s into something called ‘Warhammer’. Yes it looks like a weird science experiment gone wrong, but if you touch Rachel’s tea making set, she *will* stab you, and we’ll all agree it was your fault.

This doesn’t mean it’s always smooth sailing. The Terran desire to change their environment can interfere with other members of their species. My ship once was stuck at a port for a week, because two of my Terran crew were continually changing the operating system for our navigation’s software, both convinced their versions were the best ones. This ended with the nav data being wiped, and the ship being grounded on a random station in the middle of nowhere until we could recover what we’d lost. I did learn to always ‘pick a side’ and pull rank if there are two Terrans disagreeing on something related to the ship, so I guess in the end it wasn’t a full waste of a trip.

No, my experience with the Terrans as part of my crew has mostly been a positive one, especially since you can get engineers with a track record for ‘unexpected upgrades’ for exceptionally cheap, since nobody else wants to deal with their chaos.

I just have to make sure to provide these individuals with broken ‘items’ to fix. Most junkyards have plenty of appliances that can be purchased for scrap price, and giving Terran engineers something to keep them busy, the ‘very important job’ of fixing these items, allows you to get the best of both worlds. To allow for their brilliance to keep your ship at the top of her game, while avoiding anything important to explode.

I have learnt however, to be sure to get an *accurate* description about what broken item you’re buying: No matter how broken, or how twisted beyond repair, a Terran tinkerer will *always* get the item at least *kinda* working. I’ve had the radiation sickness to prove it.

As I write these words, I feel I must describe my current vessel’s condition, having spent a long many nights and days under the care of Terran crew members. I have an army of cleaning droids armed with various levels of weaponry, which have managed to single-handedly repel at least one pirate incursion during my history as captain of this ship. My weapon bays are stocked with several weapons I didn’t know existed, and many others which I’m very glad they do.

Every computer device, including the digital display on my toothbrush, all have the ability to run a Terran video game called ‘DooM’, which made many of my crew very excited as they installed the software and more and more unlikely platforms. The chairs on the bridge all have a massage function that isn’t manufacturer standard, and I’m currently drinking coffee that came from a device that looks like something out of a mad scientist’s laboratory. Overall I would say life feels good!

Until I don't, but frankly, I wouldn’t have it any other way.

I'm posting this on different subreddits, hoping to gather as many ideas and insights as possible.

**TL;DR**: A strange smell (resembling a mixture of dust and ground coffee) has appeared twice in my attic apartment, causing me to cough. There is no obvious cause (no mold, dust, etc). I'd appreciate ideas on what it could be.

**Long version:**

I moved into my apartment 5 years ago. It is in the attic of a 6-story building (there are 8 apartments on each floor, including the attic).

No issues until four days ago, when I felt a strong smell of what I would describe as dust mixed with ground coffee.

I walked through my apartment to find the source of the smell, but I couldn't find anything. I also smelled the same thing in the hallway outside my apartment (it was neither stronger nor weaker than in my apartment).

I coughed pretty hard, like there was an irritant of some sort.

The next day, the smell disappeared gradually, but there was still an irritation in my throat and lungs. I went out and when I returned in the evening, the smell and the irritation were completely gone.

No issues for a few days. Then, last night, the whole scenario repeated.

I have no clue what it could be. I'd appreciate any ideas/experiences from you. Maybe it's a thing with attic apartments?

A few facts that could help:

\- All my windows were closed both times. Also, my apartment door closes very tightly.

\- I have an exhaust fan in my bathroom, and it was turned on at the time (so theoretically, nothing should be coming through it into my apartment). No other ventilation in the apartment.

\- It was raining both times when I felt the smell, but it also rained in the meantime, when there was no smell at all, so I don't know if rain is a factor.

\- The place is very, very clean. No dust, no coffee grains lying around, no dirty coffee mugs. I'm mentioning this because it smelled like dust mixed with ground coffee.

\- There are no signs of mold anywhere.

\- I haven't brought in any new furniture or home decor recently.",1,1743706781.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False
1jqqydz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1jqqydz/serotonin_headache_bad/,Serotonin Headache (Bad),"So I’ve been taking L-theanine with my coffee for the past week (took it for about 5 days straight at 100mg). After the fifth day, I started getting this really annoying headache right at the front of my crown above my forehead. It didn’t feel like a typical tension or caffeine headache. It felt like my brain was just disassociated, almost like it was “too calm.”

I suspect it’s because L-theanine increases serotonin, and now I feel like I might be dealing with some kind of serotonin overload. Even after stopping it for a couple of days, I still felt like I was “on” L-theanine: same calm, floaty feeling, but with a persistent dull headache.

To test it, I took L-theanine again today, and boom, headache intensified almost immediately. So I’m 99% sure it’s the L-theanine messing with my serotonin levels.

**What’s the best way to clear it out of my system? Is it just a matter of waiting it out? Or is there something I can do to help “rebalance” things?**

Any tips would be appreciated.

How do I go forward?","I’ve personally had a tough 6 months. I had surgery 2 weeks ago and am non weight bearing with crutches and can’t bend, plus my mom passed away 2 months ago from cancer after a terrible last few months of life and lots of family drama. It’s not a high point for me.

I have a circle of adult friends, 13 of us including myself and my partner, most of them I’ve known for over 10 years, a few of them have known each other since grade school even. We are all early-mid 30’s, mix of genders, but more single cis straight men than anything else. We go on road trips and short vacations together, have board game nights, game online, and get dinner together and have for years. Not everyone can come every time, but the core 13 are always invited and I organize a lot of the gatherings. Some sub groups have formed or existed since childhood and even travel together for shows, do karaoke, and speed dating too. We’ve helped with moving, attended people’s musical performances, and helped with each other’s weddings, though more of the group is single than married. It’s usually a pretty great crew! From what I can glean it’s kind of rare to still have so many friends at our age. 

I’ve had lots of “here if you need anything” sentiments from the group since losing my mom and having surgery, but only 2 of them, my BFF (33NB) since middle school and brother in law (31M), have been really showing up besides my partner since my surgery. They have helped with rides, playing with my cat, and bringing me coffees. I’ve invited everyone to stop by on a day off and offered to buy coffee if they’d pick it up on the way, but no additional takers. A week ago I picked an upcoming date and offered to make brunch and buy coffee for anyone willing to help with some cleaning and spring yard work - not fun stuff I know, but I need the help and expected a couple people to be available and willing especially with coffee and food. So far of the 11 I’ve invited and reminded, 2 have declined due to out of town conflict, 2 are not sure due to unsure closing dates, and no one else has responded with any thoughts or availability. My BFF set up a meal train before my surgery… after an invite and reminder, 2 people participated w/gift cards out of 10. At this point, my partner, BFF, and BIL plus 2 others have done any of the following: stop by, participate in the meal train, let me know availability for brunch and chores. 

The bulk of the group are single cis guys, and I think that may have an impact. I’m usually the organizer and have the ‘eldest daughter’ responsible traits which maybe makes a difference in my expectations. Still, I find I’m disappointed in my support group. My partner (33M) doesn’t understand and leads me to believe I’m overreacting and expecting too much of our friends. My BFF (33NB) has been downright angry at the lack of response. They have been considering having a “stern dad talk” (their term) with the group about it but haven’t at this point. 

I’m considering cancelling the brunch for low participation, dropping some sort of “I’m not mad but I am disappointed” message in the group chat and backing out of this summer’s 4 night planned friend road trip. I will technically not have enough PTO anyway because of my surgery leave, and while work would give me unpaid time if I asked I’m already taking a financial hit due to my short term disability use. It’s also about $500 plus gas a person to go most years. If I drop out it’ll be a mix of the finances and disappointment, cause I could make it work if I really wanted to. I’m not sure if that is a reasonable response at this point. 

TL;DR: I’m post op and need a lot of help, friend group has generically offered to be there if I need anything but largely not showed up. Unsure if I’m being reasonable with expectations, if I should say anything, and about cancelling my attendance of upcoming road trip. ",1,1743706633.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

Normally I clean entire skeletons in one container, but for this raccoon I cleaned each foot separately to test cleaning methods I’m new to. Two different enzyme detergent brands for enzymatic maceration were used, one front foot and one hind foot were cleaned by each brand. 

The one pictured was cleaned using Ariel-branded detergent, which I preferred at the end of the tests over Biz. It was then dyed lightly using coffee to restore a more natural color, since the detergent alone resulted in bones too white for my tastes.

1jqqrh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/1jqqrh0/its_so_painful_and_confusing_to_miss_someone_who/,It’s so painful and confusing to miss someone who hurt you so much,"I (24f) have been really struggling since breaking up with my abusive ex (32m). It feels so fucked up to miss him, to have moments where I question if I made a mistake, to crave him, to panic that I’ll never love or be attracted to anyone else but him. 

I’ve just been spiraling ever since he approached my friend last week and she spilled all the beans to me. I’ve since texted her to say that I wish she had given me the chance to choose whether or not I wanted details instead of dumping them on me. She hasn’t texted me back so that’s another thing I’m having a hard time with. 

I can’t get my ex out of my mind. I’ve never been in an abusive relationship before and now I’m understanding how leaving a trauma bonded relationship feels like you’re having withdrawals. I feel like I can’t function right now. I just feel extremely sad or numb. It feels like the good moments I’ve had since the breakup have just been an act and that I’m just lying to myself and others. Nothing feels real. 

Yesterday I drove past this place my ex always likes to eat when I was running errands. It’s near me so I pass by it pretty often when I go out. I can’t help but look to see if he’s there, partially out of fear of running into him and partially because I miss him and I’ve just been so worried about him. There he was, waiting in the long drive-thru line. His windows are tinted and were rolled up so I couldn’t see him but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t trying to catch a glimpse of him. It was a quick errand so on my way back home I still saw him waiting in line. 

I just burst into tears. I got really upset thinking about how he stops eating when he’s going through something, and how he often doesn’t eat because of his job. I was working for him remotely so it allowed me to make him breakfast, pack him lunches, make dinner, etc. Sometimes I’d bring food and drinks for him and his employees on long days, and he’d always stop working to sit with me in his truck while he ate and told me about his day. He works so hard and I loved knowing he was being taken care of. 

I cry when I make my coffee in the mornings now because it’s only for me. I miss when he would stop by my house in his work truck to pick up coffee and give me a hug and kiss even if he was running late. 

I have so many fond memories with him. So many moments where I felt so loved and I know that he did too. I miss taking care of him so much and I was so happy to do it. I miss him being amazed and so happy with my cooking, and taking photos of meals so he could show them to me when he requested it again. I miss him saying our future kids are so lucky they’re going to have a mama who loves them and knows how to feed them. He always sounded so proud of me and it meant a lot. 

I feel like I am a narcissist because I’m missing now I felt in these moments. I miss how loved he made me feel. He always teased me and told me I am a narcissist and I’m constantly freaking out about it to my therapists. I tell them I’m afraid I’m actually just evil and everything is my fault and I’ve somehow convinced everyone, including them and myself, that I’m the victim. 

I know this post is all over the place I’m so sorry. I’m just really missing him and I hate feeling like I made a mistake. I can’t stop thinking about my friend saying he was so sad and kept saying he just wants to help me and take care of me, and that he loves me so much. Because that’s how I feel. 

I keep reminding myself that there weren’t enough good moments even if they are all I can remember right now. And despite the good moments, despite the love I felt, nothing justifies the ways that he hurt me. End of story. 

My brain and my heart are not aligned right now and it’s killing me. I’ve been reading, journaling, exercising, cooking, busy with school, I bought some new clothes, I’m learning to do my own nails, and I’m now looking for a job even though I feel like I can’t do it right now. I am so weak and I miss him so much. I’m not going back to him but I hate that I keep having dreams that we’re still together and he’s finally safe and healthy so we can be together forever. I don’t want to feel like this anymore and it feels like it’s all my fault that I’m doing it to myself ",4,1743706325.0,JustNoSO,9,1.0,False
1jqqqtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1jqqqtn/phillips_5400_2000_drink_update/,"Phillips 5400, 2000 drink update","Alright fam, figured I would check in.

We have had the machine for around 10 months, and just hit 2000 drinks.  Around 1200 espresso shots, 700 coffees, then 20 here and there on things like cappuccino and such.  We bought it on sale for 800 or so, including extra filters and frother.

If i had to go back, I might consider getting a machine without the milk option, as I have found i just don't love it.   The frother is easy to use and clean, but its just not what I drink.  I drink the espressos, generally over ice, with a bit of heavy cream.  My wife likes the coffee.

We came from Nespresso for her and cold brew for me, and we both enjoy the switch.  I do make cold brew once in a while, and she still uses nespresso at work or while camping... but otherwise we use the machine exclusively. 

It's easy to clean.  I set a reminder to lube it.  I have changed the filter once I think, maybe twice.  So maintenance wise, it's been great.  The noise is also fine.  I wake up at 4, and run it several times without waking anyone up. 

We use Lavazza super crema exclusively.   When I bought it, I tried to play with different roast, but it just never seemed worth it.

The negatives for me are temperature related really.  The frothed milk isn't nearly hot enough.  The coffee is not super hot either, but I just warm the wife's cup first now to help with that.  I also can't get a perfect espresso shot, but no surprise there, and not an issue and I make drinks with it anyway.

Overall, happy with the machine.  I do want a true espresso machine, but that will never replace this thing at 4 am before work.",2,1743706281.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False

""Shit. Not again.""

I was already late. First day, first class, and I was sprinting down the hallway like a complete idiot, my bag slamming against my side.  

This was not how I wanted to start the year.  

As I rounded the corner, I crashed into someone—hard. My shoulder smacked into something solid, and before I could react, I was on the floor, my books scattered around me.  

A sharp inhale. Then a furious voice.  

""...Are you serious?""  

I looked up.  

Jenny Caldwell.  

Perfect. Just perfect.  

Her blazer was now decorated with a fresh coffee stain, and her golden curls were slightly out of place. She glared down at me like I was something stuck to the bottom of her designer shoes.  

""You—"" She let out a slow exhale, like she was trying to keep herself from committing a crime. ""Do you have any idea how much this cost?""  

I rubbed my shoulder. ""I mean, probably too much if it can’t survive a little coffee.""  

The second the words left my mouth, I regretted them.  

The hallway had gone silent.  

Jenny’s jaw tensed. ""You *want* to die today, don’t you?""  

Before she could make good on that threat, I scrambled to my feet. ""Look, I’m sorry, alright? It was an accident.""  

Her eyes narrowed. Then, with an exaggerated sigh, she turned on her heel and stalked off, tossing a dismissive, ""Just stay out of my way,"" over her shoulder.  

The hallway noise slowly returned as students realized there wasn’t going to be a public execution. I exhaled.  

Great start.  


By some miracle, I made it to class before getting marked absent. Miss Bailey barely glanced up as I slipped into my seat.  

""John. Late on the first day. Impressive.""  

""Won't happen again,"" I muttered.  

She smirked. ""Right. Just like last year.""  

I sank lower in my chair. The last thing I needed was more attention.  

Unfortunately, that was exactly what I got.  

A presence.  

A very specific presence.  

I turned my head just enough to confirm my worst fear. Jenny. Sitting directly behind me. Arms crossed, expression unreadable.  

She caught me looking and gave me a slow, condescending smile.  

I sighed. This was going to be a long year.  

Then—  

THWACK. 

Something smacked me in the forehead.  

Laughter erupted around the room. A piece of chalk rolled off my desk.  

Miss Bailey was smirking. ""John, since you seem so interested in our discussion, why don’t you introduce yourself?""  

I groaned. ""...I’m John. I’m sixteen.""  

""Fascinating. And do you have any interests?""  

""Not getting hit with chalk?""  

More laughter.  

Jenny, of course, was smirking again. I resisted the urge to throw the chalk back at her.  


At free period, I made a beeline for the door—only to be blocked.  

A wall of muscle.  

Erik.  

He’d been making my life hell since elementary school, and unfortunately, puberty had *only* made him stronger.  

""Oops,"" he sneered, shoving me back. ""Didn’t see you there, little guy.""  

His goons chuckled.  

I clenched my jaw. ""Yeah, real original.""  

Erik’s grin widened. ""Oh? Little Johnny’s got some bite now?""  

I tried to step past him. He shoved me *harder*. I stumbled, barely catching myself.  

""Who said you could leave?"" Erik grabbed my shoulder. ""I—""  

""Erik.""  

A sharp, unimpressed voice cut through.  

Jenny.  

She was standing with her arms crossed, watching like this was the most boring thing she’d ever seen.  

""If you break his hand, the teachers will get involved,"" she sighed. ""And I don’t feel like dealing with the paperwork.""  

Erik hesitated, then scoffed. ""Lucky for you, loser."" He shoved me one last time before walking off.  

I flexed my fingers, shaking out my hand. ""Thanks, I guess.""  

Jenny barely spared me a glance. ""Please. If you get yourself killed, I’ll never get back the five seconds I wasted on this conversation.""  

""...Right.""  

I turned to leave, but she grabbed my wrist.  

""Come on.""  

I frowned. ""What—""  

""Just shut up and follow me.""  

Before I could argue, she was dragging me down the hall.  


Jenny yanked me into the nurse’s office and shoved me onto the cot.  

I frowned. ""I’m fine, you know.""  

She ignored me, rummaging through the first-aid kit. ""Stop whining.""  

""I—Ow!"" I flinched as she aggressively started bandaging my hand.  

""Sit still, idiot,"" she muttered.  

I stared at her.  

This was the same girl who had been ready to kill me over a coffee stain. The same girl who had smirked while I got humiliated in class. And now she was…  

Helping me?  

""...Thanks,"" I mumbled.  

Jenny scoffed. ""You *better* be grateful."" She tied the bandage *way* too tight. ""And you still owe me for ruining my blazer.""  

I blinked.  

I looked at her. Then at my hand. Then back at her.

Also read the comments of much smarter people in the comments.

Hello. If you are living in North America and you own or are looking to purchase a Vertuo Pop+ machine, please read this post for your own safety. From what i have gathered, Vertuo Pop+ coffee machines used in North America can spontaniously start spinning the pod holder at very high speeds, possibly over the typical operating range. And once the machine head is opened, this part may fly out of the machine at very high speeds, posing a serious safety threat. If this happens to you, DO NOT OPEN OR UNLOCK THE MACHINE HEAD. I do not believe the machine responds to any input while this is happening, so trying to hold the button to turn it off would likely not help. If you are looking to purchase a Vertuo Pop+, i would recommend getting the Vertuo Plus, Vertuo Evoluo or the Vertuo instead. I have no confirmation of this issue on European or other continent models, PLEASE report if you live in Europe or another continent and experience this issue.
 
This is not an official PSA from r/nespresso’s owners or moderators, this is simply my detective work this night.

Thank you for reading this, and stay safe with your machine. Please reply if you need more information.

Well, I was at an appointment and my doctor said to take bupropion to relieve my anxiety. Basically, my anxiety strikes and my whole world revolves around food. 
She said it would help control anxiety and the desire to eat all the time, and the medicine could help me lose weight.
I stay at home all the time with my little daughter, I believe that food is an escape for me, where it makes me feel good. And I also love cooking. 

It turns out that I don't know how to manage the medications I'm taking.
I take Levothyroxine 112 mg when I wake up and fast for an hour, after which I can eat. I had thyroid cancer 1 year ago, so I have to replace my hormones with medication. 
I believe it is best to take bupropion 150 mg in the morning. Do I take Levothyroxine after fasting? 
I've been taking bupropion for 6 days and I'm drinking coffee and cola in reduced quantities. But I'm afraid to consume it in large quantities due to the research I did on the effect of caffeine medicine. 

I also have questions, if I drink coffee in the morning after my fast, can I take bupropion right after? Currently, when I have coffee in the morning, I'm waiting 1 and a half hours to drink the bup.

Probably you think you are alone in your suspicions. Its intensely subjective unfortunately, and insanity defies documentation. Probably you will never find the name or explanation of the thing that visited you in the night. Probably you’ve decided that it’s only you that’s not quite right. Thereby the lie prevails. This narrative of order is the myth. As Hunter S. Thompson said: “There is not such thing as paranoia, your worst fears can come true at any moment.”

All that to say, there is something wrong with the house on Maple Avenue. I wish I could explain it in a concrete way, but I’m scared the explanation exists beyond our scope of comprehension. So, we must base our truth on instinct. That place isn’t right. It’s unsettling, like a black and white cartoon. It’s the opposite of what a house ought to be. It is the opposite of home, the opposite of safe, the opposite of familiar.

My family no longer owns the place, it was decided we could do better for a vacation house than an old mansion in small town Appalachia. You could not imagine my relief. I was sure I would die in that place someday, sure it would catch me, eventually. But I wished they didn’t sell. Obviously, it wasn’t my decision, but still I argued against it. I tried to make it a sentimental thing. We’d owned it as a second home since I was a toddler. It was practically part of the family, I said. Saying that made me cringe, the gross irony of the statement. Probably why the argument wasn’t convincing.

When that failed, I talked about the investment. Think about what the property could be worth in ten years? In today’s market, it barely matters that a place might be haunted. Again, this was a weak attempt, money wasn’t an issue for my parents.

Secretly I was hoping to inherit the property. They could keep my trust fund, give it to someone more deserving. Just let me have the house on Maple Avenue, let that be my inheritance. Give it to me, so I can start demolishing the place. No half measures, locking the doors and fencing it off wouldn’t be enough. I was genuinely planning to bulldoze the house, chop down the trees, and turn the grounds into a soulless parking lot. I’d sow the dirt with salt like the Romans did to old Carthage. Believe me, it would be doing the world a favor.

None of that is possible now, unless I’m ready to risk getting locked up on arson charges. The jury is still out on that. But I can write all of this down, as a record of what happened that night. I’m aware that nobody is going to take this warning seriously. But when this happens to someone else, whatever poor soul the house is digesting now, maybe they’ll know they aren’t alone.

These things are hard to say, not the sort of topic that comes up in regular conversation. It’s difficult enough mulling this over in the privacy of my mind. My memories fast turn to static. My sanity wants me to forget. This might be the end of me, someday. I don’t know if it’s right for me to pass it on, to speak this into existence.

Speak of the Devil, and he shall appear.

The house on Maple Avenue stands a little way back from the street. Tall sycamores line the sidewalk. Across the street is dense forest. It is very near the town.

The town you might think abandoned if not for the general upkeep. I don’t remember seeing or interacting with the neighbors. Whatever industry built this place dissipated long ago. Tall, rusted skeletons of twisted pipes and I-beams and smokestacks rest darkly among the trees and in wide lots of grass and asphalt. Broken farm equipment lies abandoned in the fields. Amidst scattered farms, a few small stores, the corporate supermarket chain, a tiny gas station operating out of pure necessity; the old Victorian houses lining Maple Avenue stand out from the woods and the shacks and the dingy ranchers, like Roman ruins in a medieval village.

The house on Maple Avenue is not isolated in the quiet town on the street with the big sycamores. It isn’t even the biggest and most impressive house on the street. But it seems to be. It’s strange I don’t specifically remember any of her neighboring houses. The yard and gardens are not overgrown, yet the house seems perfectly comfortable in the surrounding woods. It is not a large house, not imposing by any conventional definition, still it looms over you, like a brutalist monstrosity.

You could pass by driving down the street and never give the place a second look. It would pass by your window and be gone, forgotten. Which is a chilling thought. How many places like this do we pass every day, never considering their evil nature, simply because we are distracted by other things.

I remember the first time is stepped inside. I remember thinking the windows on the front façade looked like eyes and the door was like a mouth. Inside, the house came with all original furnishings and interior décor. I shouldn’t say original. I should say it was made to look like the original. This in itself was already disturbing to me. It reflected trends and styles that long predated my existence, the tastes of the dead. It was like spending a night in a museum, or a graveyard. Grotesque bourgeois decadence my ex-girlfriend once called it. My God she was the worst.

I remember a giant floor to ceiling window at the landing between the first and second floor, where the stairs swing around and rise to the opposite direction. The mirror was flanked on both sides by two stone cherubs, life sized babies with wings, weird. There were also giant mirrors in the library and the master bedroom. There were these huge golden chandeliers in the dining room, the living room, and the master bedroom. My pretentious uncle told me once these chandeliers were worth twenty grand easily. Their designs were of some kind of mythological inspiration, Greek or Roman I’d imagine, based on the anthropomorphized goats and satyrs and gargoyles holding up the glittering light fixtures.

I remember the hallway on the second floor, outside the master bedroom. I remember it, all furnished in a blazing red carpet, bizarrely combined in a satin wallpaper of equally ridicules saturation. The entire hallway, floor to ceiling, all dripping red. So red, it dizzies the optic nerve. Imagine being trapped in a blood vessel.

It's important I mention the paintings. They were probably originals, based on how valuable my pretentious uncle insisted they were. By style and subject, they looked like something from the late 1800s, like Jane Austen characters. They were all doll faced, flat white skin, wide eyed, wide mouthed.

They have that quality old portraits have, the eyes following you. It was an interesting consistency. In every single painting, every figure was made to look directly at the viewer. Even when it isn’t anatomically consistent, their bodies seem to contort in an unnatural way to keep the eyes facing outward. These paintings are stationed like gargoyles throughout the house, one in every bedroom, a few in the hallways, even one in the master bathroom.

I resented that we kept them hanging. Something about a porcelain faced family looking over while you sleep chills the nerves. Let them whisper to each other in some dusty corner or the attic, I would say.

There's something wrong with the house on Maple Avenue. It’s a doll house, someone’s idea of a house. It’s a toothy grin, a clown’s painted smile; it’s the candy house from Hansel and Gretel, a frilly, gaudy thing, hiding in the dark wood, luring you in to be eaten.

The place was a morgue back in the 70’s. we never learned much else about it, never even learned why it stopped being a morgue. It was on the market one day and my parents jumped on the opportunity. Wouldn’t have been my choice. Once a place crosses that Rubicon of playing host to the dead, it never returns to the hands of the living.

What makes a haunted house? Houses are built for occupancy, that’s their express purpose. If a house (or some part of a house) is left abandoned by people, it will be occupied by something else.

The incident happened on a Friday night, sometime in late fall, I think November. I was a sophomore in college at the time, Penn State. The day before, I had suddenly found myself out of a relationship, and without a place to spend the night. I’d caught my then girlfriend cheating on me with my roommate. My roommate of all people! Imagine the audacity of stabbing someone in the back while sleeping in a bunk just below them. The inconvenience was the worst part. I would need to find a place to stay until student housing found me another room. All that hassle with heartbreak on the side, my god she was the worst.

I resolved to make myself scarce that weekend. When my last class ended on Friday afternoon I got in my car and drove off campus without a word to anybody. My parents’ house in West Chester was too far of a drive, and I wasn’t in the mood to explain my situation to them. But the house on Maple Avenue was barely a half hour’s drive from campus.

It was a few hours before sunset when I arrived at the house. The neighborhood was quiet, as always. No neighbors were visible as I drove in. The woods were filled with birds and deer and various other wildlife, but the sounds always seemed to fade as you got closer to the house. But my mind was elsewhere. There wasn’t much reason to be nervous about the place in broad daylight. It was lucky I remembered the combination to the front door. I turned the brass knob and passed through the foyer. For some reason my mind caught in the image of a gaping mouth.

The place felt big and empty. This was the first and only time I was completely alone in that house. I was alone under high ceilings with twisting chandeliers and maximalist décor. It was difficult to relax, already I was in a bad state. I occurred to me this was the first time a single person was alone in that house since who knows when. Nobody knew I was there, not my roommate, not my friends, not my parents. Id retreated from society and relationships and found myself…here.

Predators like to isolate their prey from the herd. All the better if the target has a weak disposition.

The TV was in the living room. It was the one piece of modern tech in a place my grandmother would say was too old and too out of date. The TV and the couch would be my base of operations for the evening. It was a Friday night. Homework could wait, and I wasn’t in the mood to socialize. Id picked up some takeout on the drive down. This I laid out on the coffee table. I flipped on the TV. Takeout and Netflix is my guilty pleasure. It has the feeling of a divorced dad eating dinner in front of the TV. You also don’t feel alone when characters are speaking in the background. Which is totally irrational by the way, our brains may not know the difference between recorded voices on a sitcom or a podcast. But that doesn’t make you any less vulnerable, any less alone.

Between the binge-watching and the doom-scrolling, the evening passed quickly. My former roommate and ex-girlfriend messaged me several times. Where was I? What time was I getting back? We all needed to talk this through. All these messages were routinely ignored. Now and then I’d like a message out of spite. That made me feel better.

And the house wasn’t getting to me as you’d expect. Between the media consumption and the interpersonal drama, my brain was fried, too worn down to be scared.. Random noises were easily brushed off. It was the standard stuff anyway. A branch tapped the window. Water gurgled through the pipes. There were occasional creaks and groans I couldn’t identify. It was probably the house settling, whatever the hell that’s supposed to mean. Maybe it was the wind, maybe it was junkies trying to break in, who the hell cared?

The light through the windows turned gold, then red, then navy blue. Shadows grew and consumed. That’s when I found myself spending much more time in my peripheral vision.

 I noticed something then.

From the center of the living room, where I was sitting, you could see directly into the adjacent hallway towards the Foyer from the big mirror on the far wall. There was another mirror on the right that reflected the dining room and gave a glimpse of the kitchen and the servants’ staircase. I thought about the huge mirrors in the library, the master bedroom, the second-floor landing. There were a lot of mirrors in this house. But I suppose it would make sense, anybody living in a place like this would have a massive ego.

That was one explanation. Another is that they were arranged strategically, like an early warning system, like security cameras. You would never be forced to turn a corner without knowing what was waiting on the other side. Maybe it wasn’t about vanity, maybe someone was being cautious.

Once I read about this tribe in Southeast Asia. When venturing into the jungle they would always wear masks with eyes and painted faces on the back of their heads. This is to deter predators. Tigers won’t strike if they think you are staring directly at them.

Do you think mice know that hawks exist? What’s a hawk to a mouse, is it even comprehensible? Do they have a concept of flying? Could they imagine the power, speed, and agility of the thing that’s hunting them? It can’t be that often that a mouse survives the encounter. But as a species they must know in some capacity. Hawks have been hunting them for eons. So, on some instinctual level the mouse knows the hawk, even if it can’t grasp the idea of a hawk. We assume that humans have no natural predators. Maybe that’s because we couldn’t even imagine them, like the mouse and the hawk.

It started to rain a little after dark. It started to thunder a little before midnight. I decided I needed a shower before turning in. I trudged up the stairs, past the mirror and the cherubs. My reflection was shown to me, dark and vague in the pale light of the chandelier. I looked as shitty as I felt. The second-floor bathroom and shower was down the hall on the left. Hot water is good to burn the pain away.

I locked the bathroom door, even though that should have been completely unnecessary. A strong wind was blowing rain and branches against the windowpanes.

There’s a certain vulnerability one feels, being naked behind a shower curtain in an old porcelain tub in a big empty house. The bathroom was wide an spacious. There was a window on the far wall. The wind moaned outside. Branches scratched at the glass. Shadows danced on the wall. The shower curtain was sheer enough to give you a degree of visibility , just enough to imagine amorphous shapes and shadows moving on the other side.

To this day, I know I saw something past that curtain. Something in the combination of the lightning and the branches and my own imagination took the form of a gaunt figure with long hands visible directly on the other side of the curtain. In the split second of my blurry vision, it was standing there, watching. The shape of it sent ice water through my veins.

I audibly cursed and almost slipped in the tub, water and shampoo burning my eyes. Thunder rolled. The lights flickered. I splashed water in my face and tore the curtain aside, ready for a fight. Of course, there was nothing there. Nothing behind the shower curtain, nothing in the hallway as I stepped outside. To this day I'm not sure, maybe it was there, with me in that bathroom. Maybe my brain was trying to warn me, like I had caught the things scent, if you want to think about it that way. I stared at the mirror and slapped myself in the face, seeing the horror in my eyes, trying to force myself to snap out of it, cursing my paranoia.

Lighting flashed red on the wallpaper. The eyes on the paintings followed me as I headed toward the master bedroom, wrapped in a bathrobe like Hugh Hefner, or Tyler Durden. Far as the paintings were concerned, this mansion belonged to me. I doubted they approved of that. Regardless, tonight, we were living like aristocracy.

The bed was genuinely vast, a far cry from my dorm room. The ceiling loomed high overhead. Red velvet curtains draped over arched windows. The mirror stood on the wall, set between two windows. It made me look small, framed in a giant mirror on a giant bed in the wide bedroom in the big empty house. I felt like I should ring one of the servants to bring my tea. But I wasn’t too keen to see who or what would show up. I wondered why this room felt distinctly cooler than the rest of the house. Must have been something to do with the central air system.

Rain thrummed dull and rhythmic on the windows. The crisp air and warm blankets seemed to close in around me. I was fresh from the shower, and I was dead tired. It was strange feeling anxious about the big empty house when I should have been worried over finding a new roommate….and a new girlfriend. But I was here to forget all that, to forget this whole day ever happened.

I jumped when I saw the painting on the left wall. It was next to the door, where you couldn’t see walking in. The damn thing seemed to materialize out of thin air. It was man, almost life size, dressed all in black. His outfit looked like something out of the 1800’s, like Abe Lincoln without the hat. His hand was tangled in the bushy fur of a black he-goat. The goats’ horns were long, twisting into crescent moons. It was facing the side and I could see its one eye. The eyes of the man and the eye of the goat were painted to look exactly the same. Those eyes were demonic, budging white and lined in red. They were staring right down at me. It didn’t feel like staring at paint on a canvas. It felt like staring at something with a mind, something with intent, something that was staring back.

No way in hell I was sleeping with that looking over me. I thought of changing rooms. The voices in my head went into hysterical laughter at the idea. Look at this guy, so paranoid that he changes bedrooms because of the scary painting on the wall, fucking coward, no wonder she left you. Dragging myself out of bed, I took it off the wall and set it down facing the opposite direction. That felt better.

I tried falling asleep on the wide bed in the cold dark room in the big empty house. Lighting flashed periodically. In every flash, long fingers reached past the windows and along the walls. I found myself staring at a corner of the ceiling, far above my head. The ceiling was so high you could hardly see all the way up in the dark. It was like the walls ascended into nothing. There's a nice thought, sleeping with a deep black void over your head. I refused to close my eyes. I kept checking the corners, surveying the mirrors, imagining things in the shadows. I was tired. Something wouldn’t let me sleep.

The high windows in the cold dark room in the big empty house looked over the backyard and the gardens and woods beyond. In the day you could see low mountains past the trees. You could still see them at night, dark silhouettes against the stars.

I thought about the depth of those woods. I thought about the age of those mountains. I imagined sitting there at the window, all night in sleepless vigilance. What would you see if you watched long enough? Maybe you would see why we keep our eyes closed at night. Maybe you would see why our ancestors built fires against the dark.

Low thunder rolled in the distance. I think I drifted off around then.

I did not sleep well that night. I barely remember if I slept at all. The barriers between consciousness and dreams were thin in those hours. Sleeping with one eye open would be the expression.

But I did dream.

In my dream, I saw the painting fall back from the wall, facing up. White knuckled hands gripped the frame. A head and a face ascended from inside. The eyes were staring, screaming.

I saw the stairs in the woods.

Then I was falling.

Then I saw a desolate landscape, a grey moor of heath and heavy wind. I saw a ruined house, a stone manor, burned and abandoned. I saw the crest, carved in stone, hanging over the shattered door. The crest was a red hand of six fingers, with the shape of a brick wall below and two claymores crisscrossed overtop.

My dream turned chaotic. I saw snapshots, flashes, a black he-goat wandering the heath, a ring of figures around a high fire, a hooded face. I saw the masks, of every form and type and expression. Some were those old Greco-Roman theatre masks with the wide, clownlike smiles or frowns. Many were the ornate operatic things you see at a masquerade ball. They seemed to flicker, as if in firelight. The expressions seemed to move, to smile, to speak. The eyes remained hollow and blank.

At one point in the dream, I was awake again, or seemingly awake. I was in the master bedroom, floating above the bed. I happened to look out the window, it was still dark. In the moonlight, through the curtains, I saw a man on the street, riding a large black horse. He was staring at the house, staring at me.

Then I saw the mob, I saw the pitchforks and the torches, burning like little red stairs in the black countryside. I saw the manor, high and terrible, looming up on the hill. And in that hazy flash, in the weird dream world of things that make no sense, the old manor took the exact shape of the little house on maple avenue.

The gates were thrown open. The mob flooded the grounds. The revolutionaries came a knocking at the door.

I didn’t see much after that. The dream didn’t seem willing to resolve itself. I had an idea of disgust and depravity, with no image to inform the feeling. I felt the overwhelming decadence born of generations of wealth and idle isolation. I felt the horror and the revulsion those revolutionaries felt, when they saw the true state of their moneyed elite, and the hidden contents of that accursed manor.

Then I saw the ruins again, freshly burned, a black stain upon the earth. The grounds and the land all around seemed grey and putrid. It was utterly desolate, like the aftermath of Chernobyl. Red-faced preachers in black robes shouted at penitent masses, waving their Holy texts, speaking of the Amalekites, of the consequences of Achan and the fall of Jerico.

The crest flashed again before my eyes, the red hand of six fingers. I was looking down at the house’s spiral staircase. The images faded into a long hollow scream.

Then I was falling again.

Falling.

Falling until I sat straight up in a cold sweat. I woke with a gasp, like a hundred-pound dumbbell had dropped on my chest. I saw the time then. It was 3:26 in the morning. It had been hours.

A single thought smashed into my mind like a sledgehammer.

Get out of the house. *Get out of the house*.

I barely registered what I did next. Blurred and dazed, I tumbled out of bed. It was bitter cold. I crashed through the door. Never occurred to me to get dressed.

Get out of the house now!

 I want to be clear about something. I never saw or heard anything at that point. There were no physical manifestations. This was all a response to a feeling. That feeling was the deepest fear I have ever experienced. it was visceral. It was in my bones. So, when I say I didn’t see anything, I don’t mean it wasn’t real. This was beyond real. This was the light beyond the cave.

 In those minutes, my brain’s shallow interpretation of reality fell away. The veil tore, the glass shattered, the fog lifted, and there was only fear. Fear of something worse than death. Fear of something infinitely malicious, the hatred of all mankind, hatred beyond human comprehension. Imagine darkness so deep you can feel it, like a hot breath on your neck, like velvet.

My brain was screaming in a blind panic. Something was chasing me. Something in the house was chasing me. I was alone, and I wasn’t alone. Nobody knew I was there. Something was chasing me. There must have been some sort of explanation. But I would figure it out later. I had to get out of the house.

So, I ran. I ran like a hunted animal. I ran through the red hallway, practically falling down the stairs, tearing past the cherubs at the landing. Reaching the bottom, I gripped the baluster and swung the corner. My shoulder slammed the door frame as I stumbled into the living room. Adrenaline numbed the pain. The light in the living room was still on. The windows were black. The goatish chandelier swung lazily as if in a breeze. I briefly saw myself in the mirror. I barely recognized myself, my eyes looked like the eyes in that painting.

Through the dining room I ran, the kitchen lay ahead, past a narrow hallway. The back door was in the kitchen. That was my escape.

But something was waiting for me in the kitchen. I sensed it. My instincts repelled me, as magnets of like polarity. Memory called up the secondary staircase, from the servant’s quarters. A keen pursuer would have predicted my escape route, assuming it was familiar with the house. It was waiting to cut me off, before I could get out through the back door.

I reacted in a fraction of a second. It was too fast to consider my options, too fast to consider the stupidity of what I was doing. I sidestepped the kitchen, turned out of the hallway, and descended into the basement.

The crooked wood stairs murmured under my feet. The basement was pitch black. I’d forgotten to turn on the light. My bare feet were naked on the dirt floor. The stone walls were cold to the touch. The basement was an unfamiliar place. I’d spent the last five years avoiding it.

Faded memories informed me that it was divided into several spaces. Most of these spaces were storage for random clutter. Somewhere was the laundry machine and a water heater. On the far end was the cellar. The cellar, I remember, had these concrete steps that led up to an old hatch door and out into the backyard. The cellar was my last way out. Otherwise, I’d be in the house forever.

I stumbled in the dark, bashing my hip on the stone wall. There was a crash as I knocked over a pile of boxes. I heard a sound like glass shattering. The noise reverberated through the house.

My panic came roaring back. I turned. Nothing was behind me. I imagined long fingered hands materializing from the dark to encircle my neck. A dim light flowed down from the basement stairs. I didn’t remember leaving the door open.

I ducked through an opening in the wall. Standing there at the bottom of the stairs felt suicidal. There was a long groan from the tangle of pipes just above my head. The fear was overwhelming. But running was impossible in this place. At any moment I could stumble over some old furniture or bash my head against the wall. It was the worst claustrophobia I have ever experienced. It felt like slamming the gas and the brake petal simultaneously.

I walked with my hand following the wall. Again, I stopped when I came to a corner. Another thought materialized. I remember there was an opening to my left, just around the corner. This led into another storage room, on the other side of the wall. This storage room also had direct access to the bottom of the basement stairs. Meaning, if something had followed me down the stairs, it would have gone straight and around, or it would have taken a sharp left. If it had gone straight and around, it would be right behind me. But if it had taken the left, it would have proceeded through the adjacent room and followed parallel along the wall. In which case, it would be waiting in the opening, just around the corner.

I took my hand away from the wall, stepping back. I did not breathe. My eyes were partially used to the dark now. It was enough to spot, straight ahead, my salvation. The opening to the cellar was on the far wall. I could make a break for it. I poised myself, like a runner. If something was just around the corner, it would certainly see me. Maybe the thing had guessed my plan already, same as it predicted my escape through the kitchen. It knew me, it was smarter than me. It knew this house. But I had this one opportunity.

Eyeing the cellar, I broke into a full sprint. The terror roared upon me, howling back, a thousand times stronger than before. I ran with everything I had; Death snapped at my heels. A single misstep would have been my destruction. At any moment I expected something to tear out my legs and send me heard first into the dirt. At any moment I expected hands to grasp my neck and cut off my momentum. My eyes and mouth gaped wide; tears streamed down my face. I charged through the opening, tearing through the cellar. Then I laughed up the steps, drunk on adrenaline, hardly conscious of what was happening.

My full momentum was behind me when my shoulder connected with the wooden hatch.

There was a thud, a snap, and a crash. I tumbled out into the lawn. The grass was wet and cold on my arms and back. I scrambled back from the cellar’s yawning door. Nothing emerged. On my feet now, I ran barefoot across the lawn towards my car in the driveway. Sliding into the driver’s seat, I locked the doors and turned the key.

Just like that the fear left me in a gasp. My body deflated in a deep sigh of relief. I actually started laughing. This was all in my head. These things aren’t real. Monsters aren’t real. Ghosts don’t exist. Houses aren’t haunted, people are haunted. I had taken all the anxiety and loneliness and pain in my head and projected into that house. Mental illness, now that was certainly real. I definitely needed some kind of medication. It was all in my head. It was always in my head.

For a long while, I sat awake in the car. I was gasping for air, woefully out of shape. My shoulder hurt. I reminded myself to go to the gym more often. The windows were glazed in fog. Maybe it was time to go back inside. I looked back at the house, rising in the dark with its sharp gables and dark windows. Fear repelled the idea of going back inside, and I didn’t care to fight it anymore. I knew then I couldn’t go back. It wouldn’t be smart to risk another mental breakdown. That was how I justified the feeling.

My adrenaline began to crash into paralyzed exhaustion. I closed my eyes, not necessarily planning on sleeping in the car, but having nothing against the idea. I leaned my face against the cool glass, my heartbeat started to slow down, and everything faded away.

It was just after dawn when I woke a second time. I groaned and sat up. In those first few moments I was barely lucid. The previous night’s events were a blur. If I hadn’t been waking up in my car, I might have assumed the whole thing was a dream. It felt like waking from a brutal hangover and trying to remember everything you did that night.

I turned slow in the driver’s seat. That’s when I saw the car window. I recoiled. My thoughts were still in a haze. The realization was slow to materialize. Slowly, I placed a shaking hand against the glass. A pale, wide-eyed reflection stared back at me.

I jerked back. Then I pulled the lock and tumbled out of the car. The light was grey. Frost glistened on the grass. A thick fog hung around the car and the yard and the woods. The trees were like tall dark scarecrows in the fog. The house loomed high among their branches.

For ages I stood there, frozen, overwhelmed in primal terror. All rational thinking vanished out of my head. The world burned before my eyes. I lost all vestiges of thought, of consciousness. Only fear remained, the fear of a hunted animal. I realized what I was in that moment. I wasn’t a person. I was prey.

My mouth was agape. My paralyzed scream came out like a hollow moan.

In the years since, I’ve had an echo of that feeling several times. It’s subtle, you could easily mistake it without a point of reference. Id describes it as a tinge of anxiety, a prickling feeling. People often talk about feeling like they are being watched. Usually, Its barely there. But in some places, it’s stronger. It’s a Gieger counter. When I feel it hit me, I turn and go in the opposite direction until it fades away. Sometimes on long drives It grows and grows and grips me for a while before fading again. In those instances, I keep my eyes forward and bare down on the gas. I never stop.

 I’ve traveled and been on the road since graduating college. Never been able to hold down a job. Drug and alcohol abuse haven’t helped. After a while it felt parasitic to stay with my parents. That’s what I tell people, makes me seem like a better person. In reality I was fed up trying to live with their disappointment.

In my travels, I’ve kept a list, documenting the times that fear manifested itself. Maybe I’m hoping to find a pattern. I felt its echo when I toured Auschwitz. It was strong once on the train through the Carpathian Mountains towards Bucharest. New Orleans was so bad I was forced to cut the trip short. One particular section of Rome is best avoided. Some of my worst moments have occurred when long drives take me through the mountains and woods of Appalachia.

But nothing compares to the terror of that night, the terror of that moment.

Handprints…...the car was covered in handprints, every inch of it, the hood, the doors, the roof. Long ragged scars stretched where it tried to pry back the metal. The door handles were loose from being pawed at relentlessly. One handle had been torn clean off. Every part of my car had been clawed and pried and chewed and jerked and ripped.

This was hunger. This was a craving I couldn’t imagine. I saw the claw marks and the handprint on the windowpane. I remembered sleeping with my face against the glass, one thing layer of glass. This vehicle was my shark cage. If I hadn’t locked the doors….

But I also thought about the classic trope with vampires. Vampires can’t enter without an invitation. Maybe it wasn’t trying to get in, maybe it destroyed the vehicle out of rage and despair, a starving hunter having lost his prey.

My horror grew as I studied the prints. They were nearly human. Nothing is worse than nearly human. The hands were twice the size of my own. The fingers were long and thin, emaciated maybe. To this day I swear there were six fingers on those handprints. The hands must have been caked in dirt, judging by the smudges they made. I try not to imagine from where the dirt came…...a dusty attic, a muddy cellar, an open grave….

The worst part was realizing I was not insane. Id sensed it the whole time. Moments pass where I still sense it. But in that moment, standing there in the fog, that feeling broke the surface again. The hunger was watching, staring, waiting…For some reason my mind went to the second story window, the master bedroom. But I never looked back at the house. I got in my car, and I drove off and I never looked back at the house. If I had, I think I would have seen it then. But I will never go back. You couldn’t bribe, threaten, or force me within ten miles of that place.

That feeling, I believe, is innate. Everybody has it, even if they can’t place it. It’s an evolutionary adaptation, a survival response, a sixth sense. We’ve come to discount our fear, and we are paying the price. Fifty percent of murders in the United States go unsolved, twenty five percent of missing persons are never found. We aren’t the only intelligent species in this world, and the others aren’t our friends. Our ancestors knew, somewhere in the void of mythic history. They gave it names after all. You know its names. They knew the evil was out there, hunting us.

But I discovered the truth then, in the house on Maple Avenue, and I haven’t slept a full night since. We are but sentient apes, wandering in a dark forest. We exist in the shadow of terrible cosmic entities, and we rest only in their momentary indifference.

There is no such thing as paranoia.

And while I’m very introverted, I love having a handful of people to form deep connections with. 

I live in California and have a small circle of people I consider myself close to. I enjoy gaming, cooking, writing music, and I know entirely too much about coffee. Also a huge sports fiend. 

I’d love to find some cool people to chat and connect with. If you’re interested, send me a message with a bit about you and where you’re from. ",4,1743705528.0,MakeFriendsOver30,2,0.84,False

Ship: Odyssey of the Seas  
Itinerary: 7 days NJ - Bahamas (March 16-23)  


Day 0: Boarding (Port Liberty, NJ)

* Excited, and a bit overwhelmed by the lights (I’m sensitive to light), but I got used to it. The ship was rocking A LOT in the first couple of days. I got really dizzy and nauseous, but thankfully I had Zofran. 

Day 1: At sea

* It was cold, windy and raining the whole day. Not much to do, especially for our daughter. We got to walk around and see the whole ship.

Day 2: Port Canaveral

* We went to Kennedy Space Center, and it was so much fun! I definitely want to go back one day and explore the whole thing. We would sometimes get stuck because my daughter was focused on something, but overall it was fun. 
* Having lunch there was ridiculous. We ordered some burgers and chicken fingers, and it was a mess. The food took forever to get ready. I think maybe the smart option is to have lunch really late (after 3pm?). We waisted at least 1.5h there. 
* We were lucky enough to see a SpaceX rocket launch that day!! 

Day 3: Coco Cay

* This was the best day for us! It really was the perfect day. My daughter had so so so much fun. Everything was easy, and relaxing. No trouble to find chairs, food. Barely any lines. Easy access to restrooms. Easy access to clean towels. 
* Regretted not bringing our stroller. We were worried about the paths not being paved, but everything had a paved access. 
* We mostly enjoyed the water and beach. We brought our own sand toys too.

Day 4: Nassau

* We booked an excursion to Blue Lagoon, and while the island was a nice place, I think this way too stressful and maybe not worth it.
* The boat was scheduled to leave at 9:30 (we had to be waiting in line at 9am), but it was really delayed, and we ended up leaving at 10:15. Waiting 45min in line with strong sun was not fun. We got to Blue Lagoon at 11am. 
* It was impossible to find chairs. I definitely would book chairs/umbrella in advance if I decided to come next time.
* The included lunch was a joke. The food was kinda bad, and there was a huge line. They had scheduled times depending on your boat, so everyone would flock at the same time. We had to wait about half an hour in line for mediocre food. 
* Service in general was bad… They sold us coconuts, but then… there were no coconuts. Ended up finding ONE coconut, that was left outside, so it was warm. They sold us ice cream, but when I went to get it, it was melted, and from a sad container. Then I had to get refunds. A lot of waisted time in general.
* I really don’t know if I’d recommend this, but I also don’t know what else you can do in Nassau, especially with a 3 year old.
* Also regretted not bringing our stroller. Blue Lagoon doesn’t have nice paths like Coco Cay, but there was a lot of walking involved when embarking/disembarking. Also because of the lines. 

Day 5 and 6: At sea

* The weather was on the chilly side, and very wind. Our daughter was able to enjoy the splash pad, but I was not brave enough to go in the pool. 
* I think the Odysses really lacks activities for young children/toddlers… the little playground they had was really sad. No windows, very low ceiling. We went there only once, and stayed for 15min. 
* We did all the trivias we could lol. 
* I don’t remember if it was Day 5 or 6, but we did a Mystery Puzzle, and that was pretty fun. One of my favorite boat activities. We almost solved the puzzle, and we only had 3 people working on it (they suggested 5-6, so I think we did amazing). 

Day 7: arrival at Port Liberty NJ

* The disembarking process was really smooth. I appreciated that.
* We got scammed trying to get a cab back to Manhattan. I was shocked by how bad everything was at Port Liberty. 

FOOD

* I thought the food was good enough, and nothing I ate was bad bad. I really liked the convenience of Windjammer, and the Main Dining food was good too - some dishes better than others. 
* Lobster night was cool, but it was awkward they were checking the lobsters, and mine was overcooked twice, and also my dad’s. So basically they had to send back 3 lobsters. But I’m glad they did that, I hadn’t had to ask at all. 
* I think we had dinner at Main Dining for 4 nights, one at Izumi, and the rest at Windjammer. 
* We had lunch at Chop’s Grille once, and that was a really good meal. The Filet Mignon was really good, and the mushroom soup too. 
* Izumi was okay. I thought it was weird that the guy was almost explaining what sushi is to us (and we are asian lol), but I guess some people are not familiar with it. The best part was that my daughter had a healthy meal over there. She doesn’t eat meats (only sometimes fried chicken, but not always), so she was able to eat rice, edamame, tofu… which are her favorites.
* We had breakfast at Main Dining twice, and the rest at Windjammer.

OVERALL COMMENTS

* The activities available were very fun, but I’d chose a different ship for toddlers, probably. I didn’t know I had to check those when booking (but we were also limited by the dates and port, so…). I had no idea how different each ship is.
* We bought a ton of water, mostly because my dad was paranoid. We bought 4 12L boxes (48L for 4 adults and toddler). We had a whole box left. They didn’t give us a refund (or anything!), which I thought it wasn’t cool. They said it was the system… I think it’s BS, but also not a big deal.
* Definitely don’t regret getting any kind of beverage package. I do regret getting the prepaid cards for coffee. The discount wasn’t that great… I think next time I’d just buy at Starbucks. Also, they didn’t have oat milk (only at Starbucks). I got the card because my family exclusively drinks water, coffee and tea. 
* The ships rocked way more than I expected lol. Bring something if you get nauseous easily.
* Service was really good overall. I also thought most things were very well organized.
* I enjoyed the trip, and would definitely do a cruise again. It’s not my style of traveling, but it’s very convenient.

Until yesterday I was really happy with her, she's considerate, clean, and although she can get moody and not be the most pleasant, we’re able to give each other space enough that I haven't been finding it to be an issue.

About three days ago we had our monthly roommate meeting, where we grab a drink or coffee and just check in. Sometimes we don’t have anything to chat about and we just hang out and drink, sometimes we bring up minor things eachother can improve, for example this month i asked her to clean out her cats litter box more, and she asked me to contribute cleaning the bathroom more, and also mentioned how she’d like to bring in some of her own furniture and decorations.

“Great!’ I thought, I’m happy to take some stuff down or move it around so she can feel like it's her space too and I understand where she’s coming from, since I’ve been there for 4 years and since I’ve has 1 other roommate before her, then lived alone, I ended up just furnishing and decorating the whole place, so I definitely want her to feel at home in our space.

I thought the conversation went nicely as usual and we did mature problem solving. Then I chatted with our mutual friend who introduced us. 

Yesterday, she informed me that behind my back my roommate has been calling me a snobby, condescending, stuck up bitch, and complaining all the time since the very beginning, normally I’d take this sort of talk with a grain of salt, but my friend was telling me out of genuine concern for me as she didn’t think it was fair of my roommate to be speaking this way without giving me a chance to fix issues. 

I was shocked, hurt and bamboozled. As someone whos been trying very hard to be accommodating and kind I couldn’t believe she would be saying that to our mutual friends while also not informing me of her issues forthright. To make matters worse shes been telling friends un true stories about how me and my boyfriend take over the place all the time and kick her out so we can have the place to ourselves. This is absolutely false, as since my bf has a place of his own I always go there. The only times he comes over is to help me to maintenance, fix things, and very occasionally watch a movie. We’re conscious of how small the space is so we’re trying to be accommodating. But even so, if she had a problem with it she should’ve come to me directly right? Also she talks about how my decorating style is ugly and hideous, but like come on girl you saw the place before you moved in, I feel like you knew what you were getting into. 

I tried speaking with her yesterday, without giving away that I know what she’s been telling our friends. I asked her if she’s happy and if she has anything she wants me to do or change but she just told me how much she loves it and is grateful to be living here. I honestly want to give her notice and then the boot, but part of me is hoping we can just move past it and continue as we were before, since it’s been pretty good up until this point. I just feel at 25, I don’t want to deal with two-faced roommates.

Tw- discussion of fertility, loss, living baby, and unhinged takes on pcos.

So… my husband’s friend’s girlfriend (who we already have very valid reasons to not be fans of) confidently claimed on the phone that PCOS is caused by women being with men their bodies know they aren’t compatible with. Not “here’s a weird theory I saw online,” not “I read something interesting,” but said it like it was hard science. 

What she didn’t know is we have dealt with infertility, and PCOS was a major player. Along with my blocked tube. Meanwhile, of course, he’s out here with the reproductive equivalent of Michael Phelps at the 2008 Olympics, and I don’t just mean swimming fast. I’m talking sheer, record-breaking performances in every category. Dude is winning gold medals while my body’s over here getting flagged by the refs.

Naturally I'm out here singing lead vocals to Anti-Hero like it’s my national anthem. 

(Listen I'm sorry, if I don't interject humor where I can I will spiral lmao)

Apparently, this all started because he was casually talking about some natural methods that have helped with his chronic pain. Not in a “reject all medicine, divine masculine guru ” kind of way, just a “this helped alongside meds” kind of way. And somehow… that was her moment to go full monologue about wombs rejecting incompatible men.

And hey I love natural methods. Spearmint tea actually helped lower my testosterone significantly. But what actually got me pregnant? Letrozole. Both times. One baby to prove it.

So yeah. He popped all the way off. Full rage mode. And her only response?

 “Sorry, I didn’t know… I just didn’t think she would have it because she’s in shape.”

I walked in mid-tangent, and .... this man has spent his whole life trying to personally break the ""Aries = angry asshole"" stereotype. But in that moment he was the walking stereotype pulled straight from a pop astrology TikTok.

Because cue the flashbacks to every doctor who brushed me off:

“You’re thin.”
“You don’t look like a man.”

Cool. So I guess we just ignore my AMH of 8 and consistently elevated testosterone because I don’t match the image on the pamphlet from 1995?

I’m so goddamn tired of the misinformation. Tired of PCOS being reduced to✨️ vibes,✨️🌌 energy  alignment🌌 and 🫶divine partner compatibility.🫶 Tired of people assuming if you don’t look like the Instagram infographic version of PCOS, you must be fine.

And the whole “your body rejects the wrong man” thing? Okay ... explain how people get pregnant from non-consensual encounters. Its absolute bullshit in a glitter wrapped spiritual bypass costume.

And how do I say this respectfully… this friend .... Hes the type who gives off emasculated wet tissue energy around his girlfriend. And not in a “soft masculine king who puts his partner first” way, but in a “I have zero backbone and will let her say objectively horrible things because I’m terrified she’ll verbally annihilate me later” kind of way.

(This friend may or may not be an extremely unevolved Cancer)

So now he’s pissed with his friend, won’t speak to the girlfriend ever again, and all of this went down before I even had my damn coffee, while the baby was screaming like she’s front row... like I was front row at a Jonas Brothers concert in 2009.... completely unhinged and deranged. 

But you know what? I’m still grateful. Grateful I get to hear her rage. Grateful that my supposed “incompatibility” with his sperm, aura or vibes didn’t get in the way of that moment. ",17,1743704904.0,PCOS,5,0.88,False

- Coffee and Vanilla (one of the first jdorama I watched but thought it was kind of meh...I didn't really like the ML that much)

- Incurable Case of Love (this was really cute, not sure if tsundere MLs are for me, though)

- Onzoshi Boys (don't remember much of it tbh except it felt really silly, I watched it because the premise was similar to Ready, Set, Love but I like the comedy and depth of that better)

- Our Secret Diary (I love this so much and rewatch often, my favorite of what I've seen)

- Shanai Marriage Honey (this was also cute and I rewatch sometimes)

- A Girl and Three Sweethearts (the first jdorama I watched, honestly can't remember anything of it)

- Kakafakua (what an incredibly weird drama, not for me)


Here is my MDL in case you're curious about the cdrama and kdrama I've liked:

Hi everyone. This is a poem I wrote about my experience leaving the Mormon church, it is called Apostate.

I left the church a little over a month ago, and it has been a rollercoaster of emotions as I'm sure most of you know. My therapist suggested I try making some art about it all and meeting people in my community so I read my poem at an open mic at a local coffee shop a few weeks ago. It was an incredible experience, I met so many wonderful kind people who have had similar experiences. I am not the best editor so I apologize for that, and the audio is a bit rough in the beginning because a coffee is being made in the background but it clears up soon.

I wanted to share this here where other people could see it and maybe feel less alone in their experiences. It is a privilege to get to build a new community for myself. I was inspired by Alyssa Grenfell, and a post about Heavenly Mother from Exmormon Snippets that had no author listed, and of course, my own history and feelings about the church.

Thank you for listening.",5,1743704692.0,exmormon,1,0.85,False

There is no “Dev,” no “team” that the whole community is waiting on for the success of the project. Kendu is my project, your project, OUR project.

**PS**: The goal of this article is to showcase, concretely, the work being done by the Kendu community.

1jqpzr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1jqpzr8/signs_you_may_have_adhd/,Signs you may have ADHD?,"This question has probably been asked a million times, but I don’t really know how to use reddit so im going to ask again. 

The title says it all. What are some almost dead giveaway signs that you have ADHD? I’m 22 and haven’t been diagnosed but for as long as I could remember, I’ve had certain “symptoms” that may be adhd. As a kid I had some rubber band thing around my desk because id fidget and move my leg up and down and distract the class. I still bounce my leg to this day when im sitting still. I also procrastinate a ton. I’ll have a super elaborate step by step plan on what I want to do (things that I enjoy) yet I never follow through with them. Or I fight with myself about what will the short term benefit of me doing xyz be? I hold things off until the last minute. Oh I have xyz due on the 5th at midnight? I’ll wait until the day of & speed through it. I’m also very forgetful and tend to misplace things, or retrace my steps to make sure I didn’t leave my coffee on the top of my car, or make sure I closed the fridge door even though I know for a fact it’s closed. Lastly, I have so much thoughts in my head that I can’t convey or they just don’t make sense to me no matter how hard I try to get them out. Not sure if that makes sense, but mix that with me cutting people off unintentionally during conversations because I know I’ll forget what’s on my mind & I feel like a jerk. Or I let the other person talk, and repeat in my head what I want to say then I never take in what they have to say. 

Not really sure if any of this makes sense or if I just sound crazy, but id love to hear what some of your guys symptoms are & ways you’ve combated them to get things done & be more productive? ",0,1743704558.0,ADHD,4,0.5,False
1jqpz1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyMatters/comments/1jqpz1g/help_me_find_an_episode/,Help Me Find an Episode,"Years ago, I was staying with a friend, and one afternoon we were watching some Family Matters on Hulu. We ended up going to a random season/episode, and watched a few consecutively. One episode we saw had a scene where Steve is sitting in the Winslow’s living room by himself and there’s a large bowl of candy or something on the coffee table. I think he has his feet up on it, and then I think someone (Harriet or Rachel I think?) comes in, and causes him to spring up excitedly and he kicks the bowl of candy (?) and it just explodes everywhere. 

We thought it was so hilarious, had an absolute laughing fit, rewound it multiple times. Later we wanted to go back and watch it and realized we hadn’t noticed what episode it was, we tried guessing what episodes we had been watching and looked around there and cannot find it. It’s been years and we still haven’t found it again. Does anyone know this episode?!? Or did we hallucinate this scene?! ",2,1743704513.0,FamilyMatters,0,1.0,False

I appreciate good service and great people even more.

Over the weekend my favorite small coffee roaster - u/Brainwave_Roasters outside of Philadelphia - ran a special to celebrate moving into a new space.  $7 bags of coffee. 

The timing was perfect for me, because I'm ready to crack open the last bag I have at home.  And I much prefer my beans with a few weeks of rest after they're roasted.

I ordered the two specials, and also ordered a couple of other bags of Thermal Shock processed beans from Diego Bermudez and Finca Paraiso - two of my favorite producers.  4 bags total, for around $50.  A killer value as always.

Well, imagine my surprise when my coffee shows up today with 2 extra bags and a hand written note of appreciation on my packing slip.

And these weren't just any freebies - full bags of one of my favorite coffees ever (which they know I love) and a great fruity anaerobic Geisha.  

Do yourself a favor: find some great local companies to support.  And if you want some great coffee, look up Max and Em at Brainwave Coffee Roasters .

But it seems like they know how pissed we all are. But we won't easily be satisfied by weasel words, ambiguity and ""assurances"" that they are looking for a ""resolution"".

Sterling needs to present tenants absolute concrete details, details that they could potentially share with plumbers or outside figures to validate what we are being told, given that we, as tenants, have no good reason to trust Sterling Karamar, who have been at best evasive and disingenuous with tenants, at worst, outright dishonest.

They need to answer the following questions:

1. Now that SK staff seem to have acknowledged, at least implicitly, that the ongoing shutdowns and the placing of washer/dryers in units is likely a causal factor in the water issues we've faced, will they take responsibility and ownership of concretely affecting all tenants' reasonable enjoyment?
2. There are strong indications and stories circulating that Sterling and Starlight were told about these limitations in the building's plumbing upon takeover. Why did they ignore these warnings?
3. Given all of this, are they going to make it up to us as tenants?

I would suggest, if they want to make nice with us, to rehire concierge services, return our free guest parking and apologize unambiguously for ongoing damages to our homes. Especially given that a few years back they were warned about this being a potential issue, and tenants have been raising this concern formally and informally for years, they have no excuse except to apologize, make it up to us, and if indeed there are further repairs that necessitate shut-downs, explain them in detail and give either hotel vouchers or rent abatements.",1,1743704064.0,7JackesAvenueToronto,0,1.0,False
