Hopefully my system isn‚Äôt screwed.,"Luckily so far everything seems to be okay, but for some reason I booted my ps5 up this morning and it started to download a lost soul aside update. It was weird when I was drinking my coffee and I noticed 10 min later it was still at 1 percent.

Go to pick up my controller and the entire dash screen was froze. I‚Äôve had hardlocks in the past on my base ps5 where I‚Äôve had to hold the power button down to restart the system, but that was when playing a game. This was literally on the system start menu lol.

Anyway I had to hold the button down and boot in safe mode. LSA was obviously completely corrupted because this happened during its update download and install. I had to delete and reinstall the game.

I know hardlocks like that are not exactly uncommon. Ps5s are basically like computers anyway, and well we know how PCs are sometimes lol. However I did think it was odd that this happened simply during the main menu when downloading an update.

Alt text: Professional business meeting in Bahrain. in Seef District‚Ä¶ especially if you show up at the wrong hour.\
However, business in Bahrain today is nothing like it was even a few years ago. The Kingdom is climbing the Forbes Business rankings‚Äînot just for ease of company formation, but for its strong and evolving Intellectual Property (IP) protections, especially after the pivotal 2025 amendments. If you‚Äôre serious about Bahrain company formation, knowing how to secure your brand legally isn‚Äôt optional‚Äîit‚Äôs your first line of defense and your passport to the GCC market.\
Ready to trademark your brand in Bahrain? Here‚Äôs the playbook I wish I‚Äôd had when I started.\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs Business Environment in 2025: Why Protecting Your Brand Matters\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting., Bahrain‚Äôs non-oil sector is projected to grow by 3.4% in 2025, driven by tech, logistics, and, notably, Intellectual Property filings. Forbes Business recently rated Bahrain the second most improved MENA jurisdiction for IP protection this year, citing streamlined digital procedures and new cooperation protocols with WIPO.\
\
‚ÄúTrademark registrations rose 19% in Bahrain during Q1 2025, reflecting both a startup surge and increased foreign investment,‚Äù notes Gulf News Bahrain.\
\
The country‚Äôs strategic position‚Äîbridging Saudi Arabia and the UAE‚Äîcombined with liberal company formation policies (see KeyLink‚Äôs full Bahrain company formation guide), means that international and local founders alike are clamoring for market share. The result? More copycats, more brand confusion, and a real risk to your business identity unless you act quickly.\
Surprisingly, one of Bahrain‚Äôs low-key advantages over UAE or Saudi Arabia is the speed and transparency of its Sijilat system. While Dubai excels in glitz and Riyadh leans on scale, Bahrain‚Äôs MOICT has quietly built a business-friendly registration infrastructure that makes trademark protection accessible, even for solo entrepreneurs.\
\
Understanding the Trademark Landscape: Recent 2025 Regulatory Updates\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. aligning Bahrain‚Äôs IP framework with updated WIPO standards. The most important changes?\
\
Faster review timelines: Official examination time reduced from 120 to 60 working days. (Previously, this wait drove everyone, myself included, slightly mad.)\
Online priority claims: Foreign applicants can now submit international priority claims directly through Sijilat, reducing travel and courier costs by about 40%.\
Broader class coverage: The changes mean more flexible multi-class applications‚Äîcrucial for modern digital businesses.\
\
And here‚Äôs a personal aside: when the new Sijilat interface went live, I spent two hours just navigating the new document upload protocols. Lesson learned‚ÄîMOICT quietly switched the requirement order for power of attorney and legalized commercial registration, so double-check the upload sequence before submitting.\
For official policies and FAQs, always refer to Bahrain.com‚Äôs Intellectual Property portal for the latest.\
\
Step-by-Step Guide: Registering Your Trademark in Bahrain\
1. Check Your Name and Logo‚ÄîTwice\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation., but you can also run a free check at the MOICT self-service kiosks (early mornings are best to avoid queues).\
\
Visit Bahrain‚Äôs Trademark Search Portal or ask an agent.\
Double-check for similar or ‚Äúconfusingly alike‚Äù marks in English and Arabic‚ÄîBahrain examiners are strict on phonetic similarities.\
\
2. Gather Required Documents (The Smart Way)\
\
Commercial Registration (CR) certificate‚Äîget a digital copy via Sijilat, stamped electronically.\
High-resolution logo file in JPG or PDF.\
POA for your agent, notarized and legalized if foreign.\
Priority claim evidence, if relevant.\
\
Document Shortcut: If you‚Äôre rushing and already in the Diplomatic Area, use the Tamkeen Digital Hub‚Äôs on-site scanning/attestation kiosks. Saved me from a frantic taxi ride more than once.\
3. Submit Your Application Via Sijilat\
\
Go to Sijilat Portal\
Select ‚ÄúTrademark Registration.‚Äù\
Fill in details, upload scans in the correct order (as above).\
Pay application fees online (currently 50 BHD per class).\
\
Time-Saver: Friday applications avoid peak hour digital traffic and post-Ramadan, the workflows are fastest mid-week (Tuesday/Wednesday).\
4. MOICT Examination and Publication\
\
The examiner will review for conflicts and content (expect some back-and-forth questions).\
If accepted, your mark will be published in the Official Gazette for 60 days.\
Third parties may object‚Äîrare, but it happens, especially in F&B or fintech. (One founder‚Äôs coffee chain logo got challenged by a Saudi conglomerate‚Äîtwo meetings and a majlis later, they settled amicably at Seef Mall over qahwa.)\
\
5. Final Registration and Certificate Collection\
\
No objections? You get a payment request for the final issuance fee (50 BHD per mark/class).\
Download the digital certificate directly from Sijilat or collect a hard copy at MOICT HQ, Seef District.\
\
Pro Tip: For urgent needs, arrange courier delivery‚Äîmany agents offer it as part of their service.\
\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Bahrain Trademark Registration\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.)\
- Publication Fee: 50 BHD per mark/class\
- Agent Fees: 100‚Äì250 BHD (if using an IP consultant)\
- Legalization/Translation: 20‚Äì60 BHD (if documents are not in Arabic)\
- Total Typical Budget: 120‚Äì400 BHD (if DIY), 250‚Äì700 BHD (with full service agent)\
If you‚Äôre registering multiple classes, the costs add up. But most startups stick to one or two classes at first, expanding as needed. And unlike Dubai, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúfast-track‚Äù super-premium service, so don‚Äôt get upsold by agents promising impossible timelines.\
Unexpected fee triggers: If your business is owned via a Bahrain free zone, check special rules for free zone entities here‚Äîthe CR structure can impact trademark eligibility and fees.\
\
Choosing the Right Business Structure for Trademark Ownership\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. or SPC (Single Person Company): Most common choices‚Äîfast, simple, and fully eligible.\
- Foreign Branch: Can register, but tougher to prove distinct ‚ÄúBahrain local‚Äù use.\
- Free Zone Entity**: Usually allowed, but get local IP counsel to confirm (see KeyLink‚Äôs business structure breakdown).\
Insider tip: If you‚Äôre pursuing 100% foreign ownership or 99% structures, make sure your CR lists the exact activities you want the trademark to cover‚ÄîMOICT examiners are strict about activity-trademark alignment.\
Mistake to avoid: Many first-timers skip updating their CR business activities‚Ä¶ only to have their trademark blocked for ‚Äúactivity mismatch.‚Äù Happened to me with a fintech client, and I had to revise our CR at the last minute. Prevention? Double-check your activity codes before applying, especially if you‚Äôve recently amended your license.\
\
Compliance, Renewals, and Ongoing Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation..\
- Renewal Window: Start the process six months before expiry (renewal fee: 150 BHD per class).\
- Post-registration: Update your records with all business partners, especially with LMRA or Tamkeen for grants or employment quotas.\
For ongoing compliance or accounting support, see KeyLink‚Äôs accounting and bookkeeping services.\
And don‚Äôt forget: Bahrain‚Äôs business hours shift during Ramadan; always confirm your agent or MOICT‚Äôs availability before deadlines.\
\
Should You Use a Local Agent? My Recommendation\
\
Alt text: Professional business support. and KeyLink BH for their responsiveness and local connections. They‚Äôre not just paperwork pushers; a good agent will help you navigate unforeseen examiner queries, handle official Arabic correspondence, and even manage negotiations if objections pop up (and yes, sometimes these happen in a majlis with coffee service).\
But if you‚Äôre on a tight budget and own a simple WLL or SPC, you can usually handle the process yourself via Sijilat‚Äîjust be ready for some administrative back-and-forth, particularly on translations and legalized documents.\
\
Common Bahrain Trademark Pitfalls‚Äîand How to Avoid Them\
Importantly, plenty of savvy entrepreneurs still make rookie errors:\
\
Submitting incomplete CR documents: Always include the latest digital, MOICT-stamped CR, not last year‚Äôs version.\
Missing the Arabic logo translation: All marks must have any non-Arabic elements transliterated and explained in the filing.\
Ignoring business activity alignment: As mentioned, unrelated marks get rejected‚Äîreview your CR thoroughly.\
Overlooking post-registration steps: Update all government platforms (LMRA, Tamkeen, EDB), especially if applying for grants.\
\
Most preventative? Prepare your documents in advance, double-check every translation, and use Sijilat‚Äôs document preview function.\
\
Tangent: Bahrain‚Äôs Business Card Ritual‚ÄîWhat It Taught Me About Brand Protection\
During my first week meeting clients in the Seef District, I noticed a curious custom: the double-sided business card, English on one side, Arabic on the other. It wasn‚Äôt just about courtesy‚Äîit was brand protection in action. Many old-school Bahrain professionals still judge a brand‚Äôs credibility by the accuracy of its Arabic name and logo.\
So when filing your trademark, don‚Äôt treat the Arabic version as an afterthought. Get a skilled native speaker to help with your official translation. This simple touch can win allies in government offices, smooth out examiner objections, and give your mark instant local legitimacy.\
It may seem like a small detail. But in my experience, it‚Äôs the detail that makes the difference.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Trademark Registration\
1. Can I register a trademark in Bahrain as a foreigner?\
Absolutely. Bahrain allows foreign individuals and companies to register trademarks, especially if you own a Bahrain-registered entity (WLL, SPC, or branch). See ownership options and activities permitted.\
2. How much does Bahrain trademark registration really cost?\
Expect to pay 120‚Äì700 BHD, depending on the number of classes, translation needs, and agent fees. For a breakdown, see estimated company formation and trademark costs.\
3. How long does it take to get a trademark in Bahrain?\
With the 2025 update, average processing time is now 2‚Äì3 months if there are no objections. Multi-class or disputed marks can take longer. For a step-by-step process timeline, refer to the company formation process guide.\
4. Do I need a local sponsor or free zone setup to own a trademark?\
No sponsor is needed for most activities (see sponsorship rules), but ensure your CR matches the mark‚Äôs class. Free zone companies can register, but check special eligibility rules here.\
5. Who can help with accounting, renewals, or ongoing compliance after registration?\
Local firms like KeyLink BH provide accounting, renewals, and compliance support, so you stay current on regulations.\
\

And if you find yourself waiting at MOICT after a morning spent at Bahrain Bay, remember: real power in Bahrain business comes from blending speed, detail, and genuine local connection.\

The streets are quiet, the notifications are silent, and distractions have not yet begun their daily attack. This is the hour where discipline separates itself from excuses. Waking up this early is not about punishment. It is about creating space, clarity, and control over your life before the world makes demands of you.

Most people wait until the day pushes them into action. You rise before dawn to take charge of your own momentum. At 3:47 you are not fighting traffic, not standing in line, not scrolling endlessly. You are fully awake while others are still lost in dreams. This advantage compounds. By the time most people pour their first coffee, you have already moved your body, sharpened your mind, and advanced your goals.

It is not always comfortable. The alarm goes off and every fiber of you may want to stay under the blanket. But each time you rise anyway, you train yourself to choose long term purpose over short term comfort. You prove to yourself that you are capable of discipline. That small victory at the start of the day multiplies into larger victories.

The early hours give you stillness that cannot be bought. No interruptions, no noise, no competing agendas. In that stillness you can write, plan, train, learn, and build. The progress you make here is undisturbed and deeply focused.

Waking at 3:47 is not about the number itself, but about the mindset. It is about showing yourself that you are willing to do what is uncommon in order to achieve what is uncommon.

I mainly drink cappuccinos and lattes and I‚Äôve managed to get latte art out of this machine, even though the steam wand is mostly plastic and not very powerful, even though sometimes the plastic can literally burst and blast steam everywhere üòÅ Also worth mentioning is that my wife loves her morning cappuccino and honestly she says she prefers my coffee over what she gets at most cafes, so I must be doing something right üòÖ.

I‚Äôm eyeing the Sage Barista Pro (with baratza upgraded internal grinder) as an upgrade, because: powerful steam wand, more control over espresso shot and doesn‚Äôt take much space in the kitchen

My questions are: 
1. Will the Barista Pro really make my daily experience better compared to the ESAM? 
2. Will I get noticeably better coffee and milk texture, or is the difference smaller than I expect? 
3. For someone who already does latte art on a superautomatic, is the upgrade worth it?",1,1757073753.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False
1n93c9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeofnorman/comments/1n93c9r/norman_has_a_little_indulgence/,Norman has a little indulgence,"It was the first Friday of the month, so Norman and Lisa were in the Red Lion for a half. Lisa had just about filled him in on the latest office romance drama--much as he didn't want to snoop it was fascinating to learn that the divorc√©e in Accounts and the lady who sold coffee downstairs had had an enjoyable second date. He allowed himself to be cautiously optimistic for their happiness.  

""Do you want to share a plate of chips?"" Lisa asked, seemingly out of nowhere. They didn't usually buy food here, and the question caught Norman off-guard. ""I got so wrapped up in chatting with Edith about her date that I completely forgot to buy a panini from her. Or we could get dessert? Life is uncertain."" She chuckled.   

""Oh? They sell dessert here?"" Norman tried to look blas√©.  

Lisa reached over to the vacant table next to them and snatched the menu. Spreading it between them, she began to seriously contemplate it. The prices looked uncomfortable but didn't actually hurt so Norman read it in earnest. Sorbet, spotted dick, fruit, sticky toffee pud, fairly ordinary fare so far--   

""Ooh, look, chocolate tahini mousse with salted sesame praline, chili flakes and olive oil!"" Lisa exclaimed.  

""Why is that on the dessert menu?"" Norman grimaced.   

""It might be good. It sounds *exotic*."" Lisa enthused.  

""I mean, I'll try anything once."" Norman said, shrugging. This was a lie and they both knew it but Lisa held her tongue. After another few seconds of dithering between the lemon sorbet and the mousse Lisa stood up and took the menu to the bar. She returned with two glasses of water.  

""It should be out in a minute,"" she announced, visibly excited.  

Norman's stomach knotted up anxiously. He didn't like this idea at all. He tried to talk about Lisa's upcoming holiday but found himself at a loss for words. Not that there was much to say about Broadstairs at the best of times. Sooner than he would have liked, the plate arrived, with two spoons.  

It looked like ice cream, if ice cream could be served merely chilled, artfully scattered with broken bits of sesame candy and big flat chili flakes. Lisa took a scoop, careful to get a little bit of everything in the first bite, including dragging it through the drizzle of olive oil. Delivered between her lips, her eyebrows raised, then lowered, then raised again. She smiled.  

""How is it?"" Norman asked, teetering somewhere between trepidation and terror.  

""Just taste it. I don't want to bias the witness.""

Norman steeled his nerves. He attempted to swoop his spoon through the whipped heap with the same elegance as Lisa but managed to drop his bit of praline twice and just sort-of daubed at the rest. Balanced precariously, he managed to shove it into his mouth in one try, at least.  

Norman had heard the term *complex* applied to food before, and had assumed that that meant ""weird"", or maybe even ""nasty"". But for the first time in his adult life Norman found himself tasting five distinct flavours at once--some sweet, some savoury, some spicy--and feeling five different textures at once--some fluffy, some crunchy, some oily--and Loving the experience. His brain lit up like a switchboard, sending demands for more.  

He took a second bite, bigger this time. Lisa's eyes shone a moment, before she dug in as well. Too quickly the dish disappeared, by equal amounts, into faces. Lisa dabbed the corners of her mouth with a napkin while Norman mopped up the last morsel.   

""So."" She said.  
""So."" Agreed Norman.  
""Same time next month?"" Lisa mused.

I work as a Product Manager in Consumer Electronics, so I said ""I got you covered brother, picking a coffee machine? Easy for me."" Now I¬¥ve officially reached the stage where Google has completely broken my brain.

Fast-forward to today: 47 tabs open, three hours deep into forums, YouTube videos, and Italian websites I can‚Äôt even read‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve realized I know absolutely nothing.

If you had around ‚Ç¨5-7.5k to spend, what would you buy? Any brands or models we should absolutely avoid?

I have encountered some brands like Cime and Officine Allegra, but I had never heard about them and the prices are below ‚Ç¨5000 for 2 and 3 groups which makes me believe that they are not that robust and good enough.

1n939gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploreComputers/comments/1n939gm/assess_the_hp_windows_11_laptop_14_inch_for_real/,Assess the HP Windows 11 Laptop 14 Inch for Real Performance Gains,"Smooth multitasking, sleek design, and lightweight portability wrapped up in one‚Äîthese were my first impressions of the HP 14-dq0052dx laptop. I got my hands on this device to test it thoroughly for various work and entertainment needs. With features like an Intel Celeron N4120 processor, a 14-inch HD screen, Windows 11, and a hefty accessories bundle, it promised to be a solid contender for budget-friendly laptops.

**Light and Portable Design**  
What caught my attention right away was how lightweight this laptop feels in hand. Weighing just 3.24 pounds and measuring 0.71 inches in thickness, it‚Äôs incredibly portable. Carrying it around all day to various work setups‚Äîbe it a desk, a couch, or even the occasional coffee shop‚Äîwas no bother at all. The sleek white finish gives it a minimalist vibe, though I must admit, this color does tend to collect fingerprints. While the laptop doesn't scream premium, it‚Äôs functional and understated, making it perfect for casual users and students.

**Performance and Everyday Use**  
This compact machine relies on the Intel Celeron N4120 processor with four cores. The performance, while adequate for daily tasks like web browsing, email, and document editing, does start to feel limited with more demanding loads. Running multiple tabs on Chrome or editing photos in basic applications worked fine, but throwing in heavier multitasking caused occasional slowdowns. The 16GB DDR4 SDRAM was the saving grace here, ensuring smoother transitions when switching between apps. However, I‚Äôd view this as more of a functional laptop for basic productivity than as a performance beast for advanced computing needs.

**Good Points**  
- Compact and ultra-lightweight, making it perfect for on-the-go usage.  
- Quite a generous memory configuration with 16GB DDR4 SDRAM for improved multitasking.  
- The 1-year Microsoft Office subscription and 1TB cloud storage are standout perks.  

Check [HP 14-dq0052dx] price on Amazon.

**Display and Build Quality**  
The laptop features a 14-inch HD display with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. While not full HD, the picture clarity was decent for videos and basic photo editing. Colors looked vibrant, though brightness levels fell short under direct sunlight during outdoor use. The integrated webcam, while serviceable for video calls, won‚Äôt earn rave reviews for image quality but does the job for meetings or virtual catch-ups. 

Build-wise, it felt solid enough for everyday usage without any creaking or bending, which is often a concern in budget-friendly laptops. The keyboard, though tactile, lacks backlighting, which makes nighttime typing somewhat inconvenient.

**Advantages**  
- Comes with useful connectivity options including one USB-C and two USB-A ports.  
- Includes a practical accessories bundle with a 128GB SSD, a universal holder, and a 4-in-1 hub.  
- The compact HDMI port proved handy for connecting it to larger screens.  

**Downsides**  
- Screen resolution capped at 1366 x 768; larger full HD screens definitely offer sharper visuals.  
- Processor speed can feel limiting for tasks more demanding than basic productivity.  
- The non-backlit keyboard might be frustrating for users working in dim settings.

**Connectivity and Bundled Accessories**  
One of my favorite things about this model was the versatile connectivity it offers. With ports including USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, and an SD card reader, I had zero trouble hooking up peripherals like external drives or monitors. The Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections were stable and hassle-free throughout my tests. As for the bundled items, the portable 128GB SSD was extremely practical for additional storage while traveling, and the ROKC HDMI cable ensured quick, seamless plug-and-play multimedia sessions.

**Product Competitors**  
When placed next to peers like the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 or Acer Aspire 5 in the same price bracket, this laptop holds its own in ease of portability and additional storage flexibility thanks to features like the included SSD and 1TB cloud storage. However, alternatives often come with full HD displays and slightly more robust processors. For instance, Acer offers AMD Ryzen chips in some of its similarly priced laptops, which tend to manage multitasking and app performance better.

**Price Worthiness**  
What makes this laptop an appealing choice for many: its affordability combined with add-ons that amplify its utility. Features like the versatile accessory bundle, one-year Microsoft Office subscription, and cloud storage add significant value for students or remote workers on a tight budget. That being said, if you‚Äôre someone who prioritizes a sharper display or feels limited by Intel's lower-end processors, there might be better options with slightly higher pricing. For its target audience, I‚Äôd say this laptop delivers a balanced cost-to-quality ratio.

The living and dining are both open concept which is great but I'm trying to reconcile both flow and integration with the rear courtyard. The courtyard butts against a wooded for reference. 

What size sofa would be ideal for this space? A 2.5 seat sofa is my gut feel. A sectional is probably too visually heavy for the space. The previous owners had one but it didn't look right. How can I layout out the space with a sofa, coffee table, tv cabinet, maybe an accent chair, etc?

The dining room is tricky given the need for flow from the main entrance. I'm thinking a smaller round table, 1.2m, would suit. The courtyard is covered so a larger table can be placed there for larger dinners.

I have IBS which was mostly under control (I've got a decent understanding of what my triggers are) until I started ADHD meds (currently in titration, 10mg Methylphenidate 2x per day). Now, my IBS is flaring up like crazy. It makes me not want to eat because of the resulting symptoms. 

When I'm medicated, I simply cannot eat, which makes the side effects of my meds worse, especially nausea. I can't eat before my meds no matter how much I try. Just can't do it. I have a coffee in the morning and then it can be 8-10hrs before I feel hungry, and I can feel the effects of this on my mood and general wellbeing. I can't batch cook and eat leftovers because they repulse me, another fun ADHD trait. I also thrive on the novelty of eating different things; eating the same food day in day out is actual hell.

So this means that approximately thousands of people were uprooted to tend to the new cultivations.

Rain was drumming against the old farmhouse windows, a steady, hypnotic rhythm that usually lulled me right to sleep. But tonight? Nah, tonight felt‚Ä¶ off. Like the air itself was holding its breath. I was sprawled on the couch, trying to lose myself in some trashy reality TV, but my eyes kept darting to the shadows in the corners of the room. They seemed deeper, somehow, like they were swallowing the light from the flickering lamp. Just my imagination, right? The old house always made weird noises. Settling, they called it. But this was different. This was a feeling.

First, it was the smell. Like old, damp earth mixed with something metallic, something‚Ä¶ coppery. I sniffed the air, trying to place it, but it just hung there, thick and cloying. Then the floorboards upstairs started creaking. Not the usual, gentle groans of an old house, but heavy, deliberate steps. Thump‚Ä¶ thump‚Ä¶ thump. My heart started doing a little jig in my chest. I told myself it was the wind, or maybe a branch hitting the roof. But there wasn't any wind strong enough to make those kinds of sounds. Not tonight. The rain was too soft for that.I pulled my blanket tighter, even though it wasn't cold. In fact, the air in the room felt strangely still, almost heavy. Like a blanket of silence had been thrown over everything, muffling the rain, muffling the distant hum of the refrigerator. It was just me and the thump‚Ä¶ thump‚Ä¶ thump from upstairs. And that smell. It was getting stronger, making my stomach churn. I tried to focus on the TV, but the faces on the screen seemed to blur, their voices fading into a meaningless drone. All I could hear was the house, breathing. Or maybe, something else breathing in the house.I finally couldn't take it anymore. My gut was screaming at me to just bolt, but something, some morbid curiosity or maybe just plain stupidity, made me get up. I grabbed the old, rusty poker from beside the fireplace, not that it would do much good against whatever was making those sounds, but it felt better than nothing. Each step I took towards the stairs felt like wading through thick mud. The air got colder with every creak of the old wooden steps. That coppery smell was so strong now, it was almost burning my nostrils. It was like walking into a freezer that smelled like an old butcher shop.

At the top of the stairs, the hallway was pitch black. The old light fixture was just a dark lump against the ceiling. I fumbled for the switch, my fingers trembling, and when the bulb finally flickered to life, it was a weak, sickly yellow. The shadows danced, long and distorted, making the familiar hallway look like a twisted funhouse. My breath hitched. There, at the end of the hall, the door to the guest bedroom was ajar. Just a sliver, but enough to see a deeper, inky blackness inside. And from that sliver, a faint, rhythmic drip‚Ä¶ drip‚Ä¶ drip.My heart was pounding so hard I thought it would burst through my ribs. Every instinct I had was screaming at me to run, to get out, to not look. But my feet felt glued to the floor. I slowly, agonizingly, pushed the door open wider. The room was empty. Just the old bed, covered in a dusty sheet, and a dresser. But the smell‚Ä¶ it was overwhelming in here. And the dripping. It wasn't coming from the ceiling. It was coming from the bed. From under the bed. I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly dry as sandpaper. My hand, still clutching the poker, was shaking so bad I thought I'd drop it. I took one more step, then another, until I was right beside the bed. The sheet was draped oddly, a strange lump in the middle, like something was trying to push its way out from underneath. And the dripping was louder now, a sickeningly wet sound.I knelt down, my knees protesting, and slowly, ever so slowly, reached out to lift the edge of the sheet. My fingers brushed against something cold and slick. I almost recoiled, but a morbid fascination, a terrible need to know, kept me there. I yanked the sheet back. There was no monster, no creature with fangs and claws. Just‚Ä¶ a doll. An old, porcelain doll, the kind with cracked faces and vacant, painted eyes. But it wasn't just any doll. This one was‚Ä¶ wrong. Its head was tilted at an impossible angle, almost snapped clean off, and a dark, viscous liquid was seeping from the crack, pooling on the floorboards. That was the dripping. That was the coppery smell. It looked like‚Ä¶ old, congealed blood. But it was a doll. It couldn't be. My mind was screaming, trying to rationalize, trying to make sense of it, but it just wouldn't click.

And then, the eyes. Those painted, vacant eyes. They weren't vacant anymore. They were staring at me. Not just at my face, but into me, like they were seeing something deep inside, something I didn't even know was there. A cold, heavy dread settled over me, a feeling of being utterly exposed, utterly vulnerable. And then, a whisper. It wasn't in my ears, it was in my head, a dry, raspy sound, like old leaves skittering across pavement. ""You're next."" It wasn't a threat, not really. It was a statement. A promise. And it was the most terrifying thing I'd ever heard.I scrambled back, falling over my own feet, the poker clattering uselessly to the floor. My heart was a frantic drum against my ribs, and I could feel a cold sweat prickling my skin. I didn't even remember getting up, just that I was suddenly out of that room, stumbling down the stairs, not caring about the noise I was making. I burst out the front door, into the pouring rain, not even bothering to grab a coat. The cold rain felt like a blessing, washing away the smell, washing away the feeling of those eyes on me. I ran until my lungs burned, until my legs ached, until I couldn't run anymore. I didn't look back. I couldn't. I knew what I'd seen, or what I thought I'd seen, would be burned into my mind forever.I ended up at a diner a few towns over, shivering and soaked to the bone, trying to explain to a bewildered waitress why I was out in the middle of the night without a jacket. I mumbled something about a burst pipe, a sudden emergency. She just nodded, probably used to weirdos showing up at 3 AM. I drank about a gallon of lukewarm coffee, trying to get the image of that doll, those eyes, out of my head. Every shadow seemed to twist into something sinister, every creak of the diner door made me jump. I kept rubbing my fingers, trying to get rid of the feeling of that cold, slick surface. It was like it was still clinging to me, a phantom touch.I never went back to that farmhouse. Couldn't. Just the thought of it made my skin crawl. I sold it, dirt cheap, to some investor who probably thought he got a steal. I didn't care. I just needed it out of my life. But even now, years later, sometimes when I'm alone in the dark, I can still feel those eyes on me. I can still hear that dry, rustling whisper in the back of my mind. ""You're next."" And sometimes, when I catch my reflection in a dark window, I swear I see a flicker of something else in my own eyes. Something cold. Something vacant. Something that wasn't there before. And I know, deep down, that whatever was in that house, it didn't stay there. It found a way out. And it's still out there, waiting. Always waiting.

It was just another Tuesday night, or so I thought. Rain was drumming against the old farmhouse windows, a steady, hypnotic rhythm that usually lulled me right to sleep. But tonight? Nah, tonight felt‚Ä¶ off. Like the air itself was holding its breath. I was sprawled on the couch, trying to lose myself in some trashy reality TV, but my eyes kept darting to the shadows in the corners of the room. They seemed deeper, somehow, like they were swallowing the light from the flickering lamp. Just my imagination, right? The old house always made weird noises. Settling, they called it. But this was different. This was a feeling.  
  
First, it was the smell. Like old, damp earth mixed with something metallic, something‚Ä¶ coppery. I sniffed the air, trying to place it, but it just hung there, thick and cloying. Then the floorboards upstairs started creaking. Not the usual, gentle groans of an old house, but heavy, deliberate steps. Thump‚Ä¶ thump‚Ä¶ thump. My heart started doing a little jig in my chest. I told myself it was the wind, or maybe a branch hitting the roof. But there wasn't any wind strong enough to make those kinds of sounds. Not tonight. The rain was too soft for that.I pulled my blanket tighter, even though it wasn't cold. In fact, the air in the room felt strangely still, almost heavy. Like a blanket of silence had been thrown over everything, muffling the rain, muffling the distant hum of the refrigerator. It was just me and the thump‚Ä¶ thump‚Ä¶ thump from upstairs. And that smell. It was getting stronger, making my stomach churn. I tried to focus on the TV, but the faces on the screen seemed to blur, their voices fading into a meaningless drone. All I could hear was the house, breathing. Or maybe, something else breathing in the house.I finally couldn't take it anymore. My gut was screaming at me to just bolt, but something, some morbid curiosity or maybe just plain stupidity, made me get up. I grabbed the old, rusty poker from beside the fireplace ‚Äì not that it would do much good against whatever was making those sounds, but it felt better than nothing. Each step I took towards the stairs felt like wading through thick mud. The air got colder with every creak of the old wooden steps. That coppery smell was so strong now, it was almost burning my nostrils. It was like walking into a freezer that smelled like an old butcher shop.  

At the top of the stairs, the hallway was pitch black. The old light fixture was just a dark lump against the ceiling. I fumbled for the switch, my fingers trembling, and when the bulb finally flickered to life, it was a weak, sickly yellow. The shadows danced, long and distorted, making the familiar hallway look like a twisted funhouse. My breath hitched. There, at the end of the hall, the door to the guest bedroom was ajar. Just a sliver, but enough to see a deeper, inky blackness inside. And from that sliver, a faint, rhythmic drip‚Ä¶ drip‚Ä¶ My heart was pounding so hard I thought it would burst through my ribs. Every instinct I had was screaming at me to run, to get out, to not look. But my feet felt glued to the floor. I slowly, agonizingly, pushed the door open wider. The room was empty. Just the old bed, covered in a dusty sheet, and a dresser. But the smell‚Ä¶ it was overwhelming in here. And the dripping. It wasn't coming from the ceiling. It was coming from under the bed. I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly dry as sandpaper. My hand, still clutching the poker, was shaking so bad I thought I'd drop it. I took one more step, then another, until I was right beside the bed. The sheet was draped oddly, a strange lump in the middle, like something was trying to push its way out from underneath. 

And the dripping was louder now, a sickeningly wet sound.I knelt down, my knees protesting, and slowly, ever so slowly, reached out to lift the edge of the sheet. My fingers brushed against something cold and slick. I almost recoiled, but a morbid fascination, a terrible need to know, kept me there. I yanked the sheet back. There was no monster, no creature with fangs and claws. Just‚Ä¶ a doll. An old, porcelain doll, the kind with cracked faces and vacant, painted eyes. But it wasn't just any doll. This one was‚Ä¶ wrong. Its head was tilted at an impossible angle, almost snapped clean off, and a dark, viscous liquid was seeping from the crack, pooling on the floorboards. That was the dripping. That was the coppery smell. It looked like‚Ä¶ old, congealed blood. But it was a doll. It couldn't be. My mind was screaming, trying to rationalize, trying to make sense of it, but it just wouldn't click.

And then, the eyes. Those painted, vacant eyes. They weren't vacant anymore. They were staring at me. Not just at my face, but into me, like they were seeing something deep inside, something I didn't even know was there. A cold, heavy dread settled over me, a feeling of being utterly exposed, utterly vulnerable. And then, a whisper. It wasn't in my ears, it was in my head, a dry, raspy sound, like old leaves skittering across pavement. ""You're next."" It wasn't a threat, not really. It was a statement. A promise.

It's a pretty small coffee shop, not many visitors. and i need to document this...","It was a very cold night. I was trying to sleep. I've been looking after my mom's house for her while she's away on a business trip. It's the same house on the outskirts of town she's lived in for years. The house itself isn't bad; it's the... neighbors.

I was in my bed, watching, you guessed it, more SpongeBob. You can't keep me away from that thing. I know it's childish, but that square sponge really hits it home. Anyways, I was so engrossed in SpongeBob that when I heard a ""**Hello?**"" in my mother's voice, it **spooked me like crazy**. Then I heard a **bark of laughter**.

""**What the fuck?**""

Mom. She's supposed to be gone for three more days. A cold, hard anger replaced the fear.

""**Whoever's!--**"" I yelled, my voice cracking. I couldn't get the words out.

I grabbed my phone and flashed the light out the window, scanning the black trees. **Nothing**. Just an empty, silent yard. I stood there, confused and on edge, the beam of my flashlight cutting a useless hole in the darkness. I took a breath in. Then, as I walked back to my door, I caught a glimpse of something I cannot describe.

""**What, the...**""

For what felt like an hour, but was likely only a minute, I could hear soft **Scccrrrrittcchhhhh** noises outside my windows. Then I heard it again.

""**Daniel, sweety, could you cOme OuTsiDe?**""

My name is not **Daniel**, it's **Lloyd**. Whatever is out there be trying to make me come outside.

""**Who's there?**"" I called out.

Admittedly, looking back, that was maybe a bad idea. My question obviously played into its game. In response, I heard a loud **CRASH!** from the back of the house. Scared out of my mind, I scrambled further under the bed. Luckily for me, that was the sound of the window cracking but not shattering. A cold, eerie voice that resembled my mother's spoke out again.

""**it's me, you're mother, i See want you out.**""

I decided to not respond, i was more confused on the monsters attempt at speaking After about twelve minutes, the sounds disappeared. I poked my head out, looked around, and took a sigh of relief. I went to my window... looking back, I never should've done it. I parted the drape and... there it was, a **gaunt figure** staring at me. I jumped back in terror, yelling, ""**AHHHHHH WHAT THE FUCK!!**""

Whatever was out there knew I'd check eventually, and if that thing could smile, I think it would've. As next, I heard the most terrifying thing ever, a loud **SKEEIIIIIIIIII**.

The thing disappeared. Alone with my thoughts, I decided to not sit here like a sitting duck. I walked out of my room. Luckily, the house had drapes across the other windows already. I opened a drawer and pulled a gun out. The thing wasn't loaded, so I sat there for three minutes fumbling around with it, trying to load it. I was so focused on the metallic clicks and fumbling with the magazine that I didn't hear the shattering glass or the sounds of it breaking into my room. A ""**Click!**"" sound emanated as I finally loaded it.

Now, I like to think of myself as a brave person. I was telling myself, ""You can do this, man, you got this!""

I stumbled back to my window in my room. But what I found was... **horrible**. Glass was shattered, the window was gone, my bed was roughed up. There were signs of an entry with **claw marks** across the bed. **Pieces of wood and blood were all over my bed.** It was horrible. I **almost threw up**. I slammed the door shut and walked into the kitchen. Whatever was looking for me gave up pretty quickly... or so I hoped... as I hear, ""**Mommies... Loo0oking after---yo--u**."" around my front door area. In a panic, I shot a round into the door, and I heard a deafening **RAAAUUGGGGHH**.

If anything, that pissed it off, as a slam at my front door was followed by another, then by the door slightly giving way. I threw the dresser down in front of the door and ran out the broken window to my stationed outside bike and **PEDDLED** like I'd never peddled before...

I never saw that monster again... As I'm here sipping my coffee and writing... I can't help but imagine what might've happened had I stayed under my bed... I won't tell anyone, as... who would believe me? ...alright guys... that's all, i-

However I noticed big differences in taste when I get above or below exactly 18g of coffee.
Secondly switching grind sizes is a pain, if I switch beans it's a whole redial process simply because it's dial is bad(even after modding it)

For these reasons I'm considering a single doser.

My options:

CF64v for 350‚Ç¨

I'm not considering the DF83v as It's a whopping 850‚Ç¨ here, and paying 2x a new v3 just doesn't seem worth it to me, and at that price point I could just splurge the extra money for a Mazzer philios.

At this moment the DF83 seems great value, but I'd miss out on variable RPM setting.
I'm also wondering how much better they would be over a Specialita, which are costly here, I could probably sell mine in it's currently condition for around 300‚Ç¨ which would make a DF83 v2 refurbished almost a ""free upgrade""",1,1757072960.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I stumbled across the product while searching for a solution to my perpetually clogged kitchen sink. My life in the kitchen often resembles a battleground where food scraps and grease accumulate into a stubborn clogging army. This little powder, promising to be a ""Wild Tornado,"" sounded both dramatic and oddly fitting for the chaos in my plumbing. Naturally, I decided to put this drain cleaner to the test, and here's how it went.

**Design and Packaging**

The Iekufes GUANDAOFEN-1 comes in a compact and lightweight package, weighing just 7.83 ounces. It‚Äôs a two-piece set, so getting two bottles in the box feels like you‚Äôre prepared for multiple emergencies. The bottles aren‚Äôt anything fancy‚Äîfunctional but minimal. They‚Äôre easy to store and fit neatly under the sink, not taking up too much precious space. I appreciate the straightforward labeling that includes clear instructions, making it dummy-proof for someone who isn‚Äôt exactly handy like myself.

[Check Iekufes GUANDAOFEN-1 price on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b0djnnwyb6/)

**Ease of Use**

I‚Äôm not going to lie; I was slightly intimidated when I read ‚Äúalkaline solvent and surfactant‚Äù on the ingredients list. Chemistry isn‚Äôt my strong suit, and this sounded like it should have come with a lab coat. Thankfully, all you do is mix the powder with warm water, pour it down the drain, and wait. Simple enough, even for me. The powder dissolves quickly, and the foaming action kicks in almost immediately. Watching it bubble up was oddly satisfying in a weirdly scientific way. It was as if I could see it attacking the grease and grime in real-time.

**Effectiveness**

This is where the real test began. The kitchen sink drain was the first battleground, clogged up with some unholy mix of pasta remnants, coffee grounds, and cooking oil. I poured this powder solution down the drain and waited for around 15 minutes as instructed. To my surprise, I heard a little ‚Äúglug-glug‚Äù noise after a while, and before I knew it, the water that had been stubbornly stagnating finally started flowing freely again. Not only did it clear the drain, but it also left a mild, clean scent, which was a bonus. 

Feeling triumphant, I decided to try it in the bathroom next, tackling a notoriously slow shower drain. Once again, success! It even managed to clear what I can only assume was an unholy trio of shampoo residue, soap scum, and long hair‚Äîan impressive feat, to say the least.

**Strengths**

- Works exceptionally well on grease, food residue, and even severe clogs.  
- Easy-to-use formula with straightforward instructions.  
- Safe for most drainage systems, with no visible damage to pipes.  
- Comes in a two-pack, making it great value for multiple uses.  

**Limitations**

- Requires some waiting time to take effect, especially with heavier clogs.  
- The scent, while mild, isn‚Äôt exactly pleasant. It feels chemical-like and can linger if you don‚Äôt run enough water through afterward.  
- You may need to use a significant portion of the powder for tougher jobs, which could deplete the bottle faster than expected.  

**Competing Products**

Comparing this to other drain openers like Drano or Liquid-Plumr, the main difference lies in its foaming action and unique powder form. Liquid-based cleaners tend to pour down quicker, while this powder allows for a more controlled and even distribution within the pipes. Where the other brands shine in convenience, the Iekufes cleaner stands out in effectiveness. It‚Äôs especially great at tackling grease buildup, which is something I feel Drano sometimes struggles with. On the safety side, though, I will note that some competing products come with specialized ‚Äúsafe for the environment‚Äù labels, which this one does not advertise clearly.

**Money‚Äôs Worth**

While I won‚Äôt discuss the exact price, I can comfortably say the cost-performance ratio here feels solid. You‚Äôre essentially paying for efficiency and peace of mind. Using it on multiple types of drains proved its versatility, so I didn‚Äôt feel like my investment was a shot in the dark. That‚Äôs particularly important when it comes to household cleaning products because nobody wants to end up with a dud. Like the saying goes, time is money, and considering the time this saved me with calling a plumber, I‚Äôd say it was worth every penny.

1n931dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/NUST/comments/1n931dq/a_guide_for_nust_from_a_final_year_student/,A Guide for NUST - From a Final Year Student,"Hello Freshmen!

First of all, congratulations on making it to NUST. I still remember the day my acceptance email came in ghar walon ki khushi, dost calling me nonstop, aur mei khud hawaon mei chal raha tha. You feel like life is about to begin, that university will be this grand adventure where you‚Äôll discover who you are. And honestly, it kind of is.

When I joined three years ago, I had this one thought in my head: *‚ÄúUni life ka full maza lena hai.‚Äù* I wanted to try everything. So I went all in  societies, events, MUNs, sports, random part time jobs, even debating and volunteering. Some days were amazing, some days exhausting, and of course, I made a lot of silly mistakes that I wish someone had warned me about.

So here‚Äôs the guide I wish I had when I first joined NUST.

# 1) Academics

‚ÄúGPA matter nhi krta, skills ki saari game hai‚Äù  don‚Äôt fall for this trap. Yes, skills are super important aur ab workforce change bhi ho rahi hai, but trust me: keeping a decent GPA puts you in a much better position.

Many companies auto reject resumes below a GPA cutoff.  
MS abroad? Without GPA, no scholarships or good programs.  
Scholarships, awards, opportunities all need GPA.

Is GPA everything? Nahi. But it‚Äôs an important part of the equation. First year is the easiest to maintain a good GPA, baad mei mushkil ho jata hai, so build your base now.

Also: har instructor alag hota hai. Learn their paper setting style, adjust accordingly. Don‚Äôt get into their bad books, but no need to be a teacher‚Äôs pet either.

Work smart, grades will follow.

# 2) Social Life

NUST has one of the best social scenes in Pakistan. Don‚Äôt box yourself in with ‚Äúmei introvert hun‚Äù ya ‚Äúmei reserved hun.‚Äù This is your chance to grow. Trust me, everyone‚Äôs nice, you just need to say hi first.

If you‚Äôre lucky, good classmates make it easier.  
Groups form early, toh baad mei left out wali feeling ho sakti hai. So talk to people, see kis se vibe match hoti hai.

Aur agar classmates se itna acha scene nahi hai, don‚Äôt worry. Bahar bohot opportunities hain to meet people.

# 3) Societies & Events

Welcome to NUST‚Äôs societies. Basically students with a common interest band together, take up roles, organize events.

Which societies to join?  
AIESEC (hands down best, also international)  
NCSC (super active, lots of events)  
NMS (if you‚Äôre into music)  
Niche ones: NDS (drama), NXC (excursions), NAC (adventure), NARC (archery), etc.

How to join? Follow Insta pages, fill forms, give interviews. Don‚Äôt stress, interviews bhi students lete hain.

But here‚Äôs a truth: NUST Events > NUST Societies  
Why? Events are short (2 to 3 months), less commitment, but huge learning and connections. Central events like NIMUN, Olympiad, NMF, NFL, Piston Cup are worth it.

Why join at all?  
Not directly for your CV. I‚Äôve done 10+ societies, countless events, and I don‚Äôt even list them. The value is in exposure and stories.

In interviews they ask: ‚ÄúTell me a time you showed leadership or conflict resolution?‚Äù meri sari kahaniyan yahin se aati hain.

# 4) Work & Learning Opportunities

NUST has NSTP (National Science & Technology Park) on campus. Two ways to benefit:

Internships or part time work: Check company list, email them, ya directly walk into offices with your CV. 10 mein se 1 to 2 will hire.  
Startups: If you have an idea, pitch at FICS or apply to Hatch8. Real funding and resources milte hain. Students have built companies like Inlights, EcoBricks, Vyro.

# 5) Cafes & Activities

Food: C1 general vibe, C2 chowmein, S3H roll paratha, NICE shawarma, C4 biryani, NSTP cafe best food, Coffee Lounge for vibe, C3 chai and view.  
Gym: Sports Complex gym (paid, 1k per month, worth it). S3H gym (free but meh).  
Saddle Club: Horse riding at dirt cheap rates.  
Extras: Bowling, language courses (German, French, Turkish), minors in other majors, exchange programs (not fully funded but worth it), trips (solo bhi chale jao, important).

# Final Advice

Your time here will fly by. You‚Äôll meet people from all kinds of backgrounds. Learn to get along, decide what you want out of uni life.

Good job after graduation?  
Startup or business?  
Just memories and fun?

Plan accordingly. Don‚Äôt just go with the flow. Who you know is more important than what you know. Be social, stay optimistic, and opportunities will come.

And please document your uni life. Take photos, silly videos, TikToks. After this, practical life hits hard, and you‚Äôll wish you enjoyed more.

There is so much more i wanna talk about but is post ko itna hi rehne deete hein..

If you need anything, notes, course guidelines (especially NBS freshies), ya koi issue, my DMs are open. Message me, I‚Äôll help out.

Recorded lectures and short weekly workshops let me stack study blocks around long weekends and road trips. A scholarship helped with tuition a little over ‚Ç¨6,000, return flights were just over ‚Ç¨2,000, and rental cars became essential outside the cities. Living costs were higher than expected, but early visa planning and a careful budget kept it manageable.

**Sunshine Coast (QLD)**  
Cliffside walks in Noosa, Kondalilla‚Äôs waterfalls and rock pools, quiet stretches like Peregian and Coolum, and sunset views over the Glass House Mountains. Weekend markets felt genuinely local. A car matters because public transport is thin.

**Brisbane**  
CityCat ferries along the river and skyline views from Mt Coot-Tha. The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was both moving and educational, a calm counterpoint to the city.

**Rainbow Beach and Carlo Sand Blow**  
Wide, calm shoreline and clear water for slow days. The sand blow above town glows at sunset and frames a panorama toward K‚Äôgari that feels otherworldly.

**Double Island Point**  
Long, forgiving waves make it a dream spot to learn to surf. You need a 4√ó4 and the right tide, and day trips from Noosa literally drive the beach to the headland.

**K‚Äôgari (Fraser Island) and Hervey Bay**  
Beach driving on packed sand feels like freedom, with tea-stained Lake Boomanjin, bright freshwater lakes and rainforest inland. Hervey Bay was my place for a respectful whale swim, since migrating humpbacks rest here and encounters are unhurried.

**Whitsundays and the Reef**  
Whitehaven‚Äôs quartz sand really is that white. My girlfriend (who visited me during my stay) and me sailed by catamaran and stopped to snorkel coral gardens on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef.

**Byron Bay**  
Sunrise at the lighthouse, mellow surf and an easy afternoon at The Farm among macadamias and animals. An hour inland, Minyon Falls plunges from lush rainforest in Nightcap National Park.

**Gold Coast**  
High-rise skyline, long beaches and a dose of nightlife, with national parks close by. Surfers Paradise is loud and iconic, while Burleigh feels more local and scenic. Fun fact for fans: parts of H2O were filmed around here.

**Melbourne**  
Stayed near South Yarra with excellent coffee within minutes and slow laps through the botanic gardens with city views. In Parliament House you can feel the British legacy in the two chambers and even a throne kept for rare royal visits.

**Great Ocean Road**  
A mini-bus day trip delivered windswept cliffs and the Twelve Apostles glowing at sunset. If you have time, drive yourself and sleep in the small coastal towns.

**Sydney**  
Ferries past the Opera House and Harbour Bridge, the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk and a free Opera House tour where the tiles look creamier than in photos. I earned my scuba certification in a quiet bay, met a curious octopus that wrapped tiny tentacles around my fingers, a big blue fish my instructor has known for years, a starfish and a small brown shark. Halloween at The Rocks was perfectly spooky.

**Canberra (ACT)**  
Often underrated, yet fascinating for Parliament‚Äôs architecture, the High Court, the Royal Australian Mint and the logic of a planned city. Free tours help you read the place.

**Blue Mountains**  
The eucalyptus haze really does tint the valleys blue. The Three Sisters are dramatic and trails drop quickly into waterfalls and fern-filled gullies.

**Tasmania**  
Hobart‚Äôs colonial streets, wombats roaming car-free Maria Island and a chilly dive with playful seals below towering cliffs. Give Tassie at least a week, the north deserves time. I wish I‚Äôd known that earlier.

**Cape Tribulation and Daintree Rainforest**  
Where rainforest meets reef after a drive from Cairns. A guided night walk filled with a living soundscape and tiny glowing crabs, a Daintree River cruise with croc sightings beneath giant palms, and bungalows set inside the forest made it all feel close.

**Top End: Darwin, Litchfield, Kakadu**  
Darwin sunsets are outrageous and the city works well as a base. Litchfield felt like a natural swimming complex of rock pools and waterfalls, with huge termite mounds, wild bats and a sudden monsoon with lightning right beside the car. Kakadu humbled me with Ubirr and Nourlangie rock art, sunrise on the East Alligator River and floodplains that can close whole sections in the wet season.

**Red Centre: Alice Springs, West MacDonnell, Kings Canyon, Uluru**  
From Alice the road threads through the West MacDonnell ranges via Ormiston Gorge, then an unsealed stretch of red sand where I saw cows, a horse with a foal and even a camel, so water, a spare can and patience matter. Kings Canyon was a night under absurd stars, then the Rim Walk and the Garden of Eden oasis. Uluru sits 15 minutes from Yulara inside the national park, tickets and gates in place, with dedicated viewpoints for each time of day. I caught a little rainbow once at sunset, admired waterholes and rock art at the base. The climb has been closed since 2019 out of respect for the Anangu.

**Practical notes**  
Tuition for one term was a little over ‚Ç¨6,000 and visa fees rose shortly after my stay, so apply early and budget carefully. A scholarship made the difference for me and I would absolutely encourage people to try for one. A car opened up most of what I loved and I kept buffers for distance and weather, especially in the north.

Thanks for reading. If you have questions about routes, budgeting, study logistics or timing, feel free to comment or message me.

1n92xb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1n92xb7/can_philips_aquaclean_filter_truly_enhance_coffee/,Can Philips AquaClean Filter Truly Enhance Coffee Taste? A Detailed Review,"I‚Äôve been using the Philips Kitchen Appliances CA6903/10 AquaClean Filter for a few months in my espresso machine, and let me share what that experience has been like. This product promises no descaling is required for up to 5,000 cups, and as someone who loves their coffee ritual but hates maintenance, that claim compelled me to try it immediately. You‚Äôll find key features like its ability to reduce limescale, ease of installation with its click-and-go system, and the inclusion of ion-exchange technology pretty intriguing. Here‚Äôs how it holds up in practice.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stood out was the compact design. Measuring 4""D x 6""W x 3""H and weighing 5.6 ounces, it fits seamlessly into my espresso machine, almost as if it‚Äôs an invisible part of the appliance. The plastic material feels durable but lightweight, and the construction doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. I‚Äôve handled plenty of water filters before, and this one strikes a balance between solid design and usability.  

**Ease of Installation**  
I‚Äôve met filters in the past that felt more like puzzles, requiring me to sort through instruction manuals. Not this one. You literally click it into place. It‚Äôs so spot-on intuitive that my less-tech-savvy cousin installed one on his machine without help. I appreciate how it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm battling my coffee machine just to keep it running.  

[Check Philips Kitchen Appliances CA6903/10 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b08g3l9ht2/)  

**Performance and Impact on Coffee Taste**  
Here‚Äôs where the AquaClean filter truly shines. The micro-porous filter keeps my water clean, and I‚Äôve noticed a distinct improvement in the flavor and freshness of my coffee. It feels as though the filter strips out anything that could affect flavor negatively. Knowing that I don‚Äôt have to descale my machine for up to 5,000 cups is a bonus I never knew I needed. My co-worker, a self-identified espresso snob, also pointed out that the coffee tasted smoother.  

**Benefits**  
- Effortless click-and-go installation.  
- It maintains excellent water quality and prolongs machine life.  
- Ion-exchange technology reduces calcium naturally, preserving coffee flavor.  
- Zero descaling required for 5,000 cups saves time and effort.  

**Negatives**  
- While the product is designed to last long, some users (and I can vouch for this) experience reduced efficiency if maintenance guidelines aren‚Äôt strictly followed.  
- It only works with specific Philips and Saeco espresso machines. That limits compatibility, which could be frustrating for users with machines from other brands.  

**Suitable Users and Specific Audience**  
This filter is a must-have for regular coffee drinkers using Philips or Saeco espresso machines. If you‚Äôre someone who, like me, balks at the idea of spending too much time on maintenance, this product simplifies life. On the flip side, if you own a device from a different brand, this isn‚Äôt for you unless you‚Äôre ready to switch machines altogether, which is obviously impractical.  

**Competing Products**  
When stacked up against Brita or PUR water filter pitchers, the AquaClean filter stands out for its specialized focus on coffee quality. Where regular water filters cater broadly to drinking water, this one excels as a targeted product for espresso lovers. Compared to generic water filters, it easily wins in simplifying the descaling process. Other coffee machine filters exist, but they lack crucial features like the micro-porous filter and click-and-go setup.  

**Price Worthiness**  
It's a tad pricier compared to generic water filters, but those don‚Äôt offer the same level of machine-specific technology. You‚Äôre essentially paying for a filter that not only protects your coffee maker but also enhances the taste and texture of your espresso. Considering the savings on maintenance and the richer overall coffee experience, it feels like smart spending to me.

1n92vp9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n92vp9,Mangoes & Pure Lands,"This morning, I set aside mango chunks for Heidi. Remembering our visit yesterday, she came out and saw the empty bowl. So I have my coffee and nuts, and she likes the mangoes. And I ate them all yesterday, so I said, OK, I'll remember tomorrow to leave them out for you. So they're sitting there in the dish, waiting for her. They're all hers, if she comes out.

It reminded me of this very morning in my ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra study, and I'm on the chapter called Twenty-Five Sages, where all these enlightened beings speak about how they attained enlightenment. One of them, Great Strength Bodhisattva, said his path was through mindfulness of the Buddha (Âøµ‰Ωõ). He compared it to a mother always remembering her child: if they ever become separated, like the child gets lost, the mother will never stop thinking about them, but if the child doesn't think of their mother, they won't connect.  But if the child is mindful of the mother, they are sure to find each other. How could they not?

Great Strength taught that by gathering the six senses, letting go of distractions, and centering on the Buddha, one attains the something called the 'SamƒÅdhi of Mindfulness Buddha'. One sincere thought of the Buddha can cut through a thousand false thoughts. When we recite the Buddha‚Äôs name with mindfulness, our mind aligns with the Buddha‚Äôs constant mindfulness, and the path to awakening naturally opens.

Just as a child who remembers the mother finds reunion, if Heidi remembers to come out, the mangoes are hers. In the same way, if we remember the Buddha, we connect with that boundless compassion, and that connection can awaken the Buddha within us. And Heidi can enjoy her mango.",6,1757072326.0,Buddhism,0,1.0,False
1n92vo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1n92vo5/can_sisbroo_cord_organizer_for_appliances_truly/,Can SisBroo Cord Organizer for Appliances Truly Simplify Your Kitchen Setup? Review Inside!,"The SisBroo B/W-4 Cord Organizer for appliances has seamlessly slipped into my daily kitchen routine, solving a problem I didn‚Äôt even realize I needed fixing until now. If you've ever dealt with the mess of cords from gadgets like coffee makers, air fryers, or blenders sprawled across your kitchen counter, you‚Äôll likely understand the relief this compact silicone cord holder provides. With dimensions of 4.05 x 1.06 inches, it may look minimal, but it packs a punch in utility. The set I tested comes in a black-and-white combination (2 of each), blending effortlessly into various kitchen settings. Its simplicity in design, paired with premium features, definitely caught my attention‚Äîboth for the good and not-so-great reasons.

**Compact Design and Usability**  
One thing that stood out immediately was how easy it was to integrate these cord organizers into my appliances' lives (and mine). The lightweight feel, despite the sturdy silicone material, made them easy to install. My coffee maker‚Äôs cord, which used to trail behind the counter awkwardly, now sits neatly in place. These little helpers also worked phenomenally on my air fryer and blender, ensuring no dangling cords get in the way while cooking. While the organizers stick firmly once applied, the silicone‚Äôs flexibility ensures a snug fit on both curved and flat surfaces‚Äîsomething my mixer‚Äôs odd shape truly put to the test.  

**Check SisBroo B/W-4 price on Amazon.**  

**Adhesive Strength: A Strong Selling Point**  
I won‚Äôt lie; I was skeptical about whether these organizers would actually stay put. The PE foam adhesive they sport, combined with a widened contact area, performed better than expected. My initial trial run involved sticking one onto a slightly textured mixer surface, and after cleaning and drying it properly (as recommended), I was impressed by how firmly it adhered. Days of regular use and repositioning the cord later‚Äîstill no sign of it budging. These organizers claim to resist falling off, and from my experience, I‚Äôd say they deliver on that promise. However, be warned‚Äîif you‚Äôre careless during the sticking process or attach them immediately without ensuring a clean and dry surface, they might not hold quite as well.

**Strengths**  
- Strong, reliable adhesive for firm attachment.  
- Compact, lightweight design blends well with kitchen appliances.  
- Highly versatile and can fit curved or smooth appliance bodies.  
- Silicone material is comfortable to touch and heat-resistant.  
- Keeps cords firmly in place with better wrapping, enhancing kitchen safety and organization.  

**Material and Durability**  
Knowing these organizers were made from high-quality silicone gave me confidence they'd withstand varying conditions. Here‚Äôs what I liked most: they resist high temperatures, a win for gadgets like toasters and hot plates. They‚Äôre also electrically insulated (a safety win), adding peace of mind while reducing countertop chaos. Over the weeks of use, they‚Äôve proved to be durable, showing no signs of wear or loss of flexibility even after handling cords of varied thicknesses.

**Caveats**  
- Limited adhesive performance if the installation surface isn‚Äôt carefully cleaned or dried.  
- May not work as effectively on appliances with rough, textured surfaces.  

**Applications Beyond the Kitchen**  
What really adds value to this product is its versatility. Although I initially bought this set to tackle kitchen appliance cords, its uses extend far beyond that. I‚Äôve used them to secure phone charger cables near my bedside and, believe it or not, even hung a lightweight shoulder bag from one. These little organizers have become unexpected problem-solvers in my home. Imagine avoiding the last-minute hunt for tangled headphone wires‚Äîit‚Äôs possible now.

**Product Advantages Over Competitors**  
Speaking of alternatives, plenty of cord organizers on the market promise to do the job‚Äîand I‚Äôve tried my share. Compared to reusable twist ties or plastic cable clips, the SisBroo B/W-4 cord holder shines in durability due to its silicone body, whereas alternatives often crack or lose grip over time. Additionally, its adhesive grip is leagues ahead of suction-based solutions, which fail entirely on non-glass surfaces. On the flip side, certain magnetic cord wraps offer easier reusability‚Äîbut they don‚Äôt stick to most appliances the way these organizers do. This balance of form and function is what gives SisBroo‚Äôs product a noticeable edge in the market.

**Price To Quality Ratio**  
Now, doubts like ‚Äúis it worth it?‚Äù naturally resurface when examining compact solutions like these. What surprised me most is the cost-efficiency at play here. Many will argue that such organizers are a luxury item, but as someone who couldn't endure the daily tangle of wires any longer, I genuinely disagree. Comparing its long-term benefits to recurring frustrations, SisBroo B/W-4 represents smart spending. It doesn't feel overpriced, but also doesn't compromise on the essential aspects of quality, durability, and user experience.

I love children and I myself have three (ages 6, 4, 2). I have the ability to work part time so that I‚Äôm able to spend a lot of time with them: mornings, evenings, taking them to activities and just enjoying fun time with them. I also understand that there are places/times that are appropriate for grown-ups only.

I have a group of friends who have children similarly-aged. In fact, there are 11 children between all of us, ages 6 and under. We occasionally get together for dinner to chat and catch up. These dinners are sans kids because: (1) we like to try restaurants that might have only an adult menu and ambiance; (2) we tend to go after bedtime; and (3) sitting at a dinner table listening to grownups chit-chat seems incredibly tedious for a child. We also take the kids to dinner together sometimes at more appropriate restaurants and times.

We‚Äôre planning to go to a new restaurant next week at 7pm that has an elevated menu and setting. We‚Äôre excited to try it out and catch up. A friend (A) invited her friend (B), whom I haven‚Äôt met. B has a pre-school aged child and (I believe) a 12-week-old baby.

The more, the merrier to me, happy to meet someone new. Changed the reservation, checked dietary restrictions, etc. 

A then popped in that B would only be able to come if she could bring the baby. B added that she called the restaurant to tell them she‚Äôd be bringing her stroller, but they didn‚Äôt answer. 

So far, radio silence on the group text. I feel obligated to respond as I set up the dinner.

Personally, I‚Äôd like it to be just a grown-up dinner. For a few reasons: (1) the restaurant has a small floor plan and bringing a stroller could impede traffic; (2) this isn‚Äôt a kid-friendly restaurant; (3) reservations are hard to come by and I have a feeling other diners probably don‚Äôt want to hear a crying baby while they‚Äôre enjoying a night out; and (4) it‚Äôs just distracting. 

On the one hand, I‚Äôve definitely been on the other side of this ‚Äî just having a baby can be very isolating and the need for adult interaction is strong. But on the other hand, I also understood that some things I‚Äôd have to say no to, or plan a more appropriate outing, say lunch or coffee. 

WIBTA if I asked B not to bring the baby or, alternatively, finding childcare? She didn‚Äôt mention bringing her older child, so I‚Äôm assuming someone is watching them. I was going to suggest a few babysitters I could reach out to for her. But that seems a little passive-aggressive. I don‚Äôt want her to feel excluded, but at the same, I just don‚Äôt know how enjoyable this would be for everyone (B included)! 

Thanks in advance and open to suggestions!

But after 30 days of actually applying James Clear's methods from Atomic Habits, I'm a different person.

Here's what happened when I stopped reading about habits and started building them:

* I started stupidly small. Instead of ""I'm gonna work out for an hour every day,"" I committed to one push-up. That's it. Sounds dumb, right? But I actually did it. One turned to five. Then five turned to 10. I now do 20 pushups in a set when it's chest day.
* I made it impossible to fail. Put my workout clothes right next to my bed. Left a water bottle on my nightstand. Put a book on my pillow. When I woke up, healthy stuff was literally in my face. I also stopped buying junk food and soda's. No more fast food deliveries too.
* I piggybacked on stuff I already do. ""After I brush my teeth, I'll do my push-up."" ""After I pour coffee, I'll read one page."" I attached new habits to things I was already doing automatically. Same thing where I'll meditate after making my bed.

What happened week by week:

* Week 1: Doing my one push-up feeling like an idiot. But hey, I did it every day.
* Week 2: Started doing 5 push-ups because one felt too easy. Read 2-3 pages because one wasn't enough.
* Week 3: 15-20 push-ups felt normal. Reading for 10-15 minutes became automatic.
* Week 4: Full 30-minute workouts. Reading 30+ pages daily. It just happened. I realized this what compound growth means.

I stopped thinking of myself as lazy. I became ""someone who works out daily"" and ""someone who reads."" My brain literally rewired itself.

What I learned:

* Small and consistent beats big and sporadic every time. I'd rather do one push-up every day for a year than 100 push-ups once.
* Your environment matters more than your willpower. If you make good choices easier and bad choices harder, you'll naturally do better.
* Missing one day doesn't matter. Missing two days in a row starts a bad pattern.

Biggest mistake I made was tying to change everything at once. I focused on just two habits exercise and reading. That's it.

If you want to try this: just Pick ONE tiny habit. Make it so small it feels almost stupid. Do it for 30 days. Don't worry about results, just show up.

I went from zero exercise and zero books to working out daily and reading 2-3 books a month. Not because I became more disciplined, but because I made it easier.",19,1757071267.0,TheImprovementRoom,1,0.95,False

1n92f13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewVoyage/comments/1n92f13/should_you_trust_soilove_laundry_stain_remover/,Should You Trust Soilove Laundry Stain Remover for Tough Stains,"Testing out the Soilove Laundry Stain Remover, I felt like I was diving into an ambitious stain-busting mission. This product, offered as a convenient 22oz spray bottle paired with a hefty 128oz refill, caught my attention for its promise of tackling even the most stubborn stains. Let me tell you, juggling a household with kids who seem to be stain magnets, I‚Äôve become somewhat of an expert in everything stain-related, and Soilove stood up to a lot of my scrutinies.

**Effective Stain-Busting Performance**  
This stain remover is like a beast that thrives on chaos‚Äîspaghetti spills, ink smudges, or mysterious blotches that seem to materialize out of nowhere were handled with ease. Its triple-action enzyme formula clings to the fabric, wiggles its way into the fibers, and lifts the stain out like some invisible eraser. Blood and oil stains, which typically laugh in the face of most products, were obliterated without a fuss. Once, when my niece toppled a glass of red wine on our linen tablecloth, I half-expected a permanent scar. A few sprays and a quick application later, the tablecloth was back to its former glory. Simplicity in execution, paired with reliability, stood out.

**Ease of Use and Versatility**  
This one isn‚Äôt just for clothes, though its label emphasizes that the most. The versatility impressed me when I used it on our couch after someone (not naming names, but looking at you, Rex the dog) failed to respect the unwritten rule of ""no muddy paws."" Whether I sprayed and rubbed immediately or let it sit before washing a few hours later, Soilove didn‚Äôt throw tantrums‚Äîit simply delivered. The fact that it works in both hot and cold water means I didn't have to play the guessing game when tossing items into the washer. Safe for both standard and high-efficiency machines, it harmonized with my laundry setup without a hitch.

[Want Soilove Laundry Stain Remover? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://blog.sanue.com/p/b0dwhkzmx9/)  

**Design and Quantity**  
The inclusion of a 22oz spray bottle feels incredibly thoughtful. It's perfect for quick treatments and allows you to act swiftly instead of having to fumble for a larger bottle. The 128oz refill is a beast; it feels like it‚Äôs designed for the apocalypse or, more realistically, a house with endless spills. For families or anyone with kids, pets, or particularly clumsy friends (we‚Äôve all got one), this combo is an absolute godsend. Having the refill saves money and reduces waste, a point that helps me sleep a little better at night.

**Positives**  
‚Ä¢ Triple-action formula that doesn‚Äôt just mask stains‚Äîit eliminates them.  
‚Ä¢ Extremely effective on a wide variety of stains, from the usual coffee to the rogue ink marks.  
‚Ä¢ Works well across different water temperatures and fabric types, even colorfast clothing.  

**Negatives**  
‚Ä¢ The packaging design of the refill bottle lacks finesse. Pouring it into the spray feels like an exercise in precision‚Äîit could benefit from a nozzle or spout.  
‚Ä¢ Despite its effective cleaning powers, it isn‚Äôt made for multitasking over every kind of surface. Stains on delicate silks or non-washable fabrics? Proceed with caution.  

**Safe for the Environment Yet Gentle on Clothes**  
I respect that this is made in the U.S., keeping up quality standards and ensuring reliability. Plus, for all my eco-conscious friends, it‚Äôs reassuring to see that the product is built with harmless ingredients‚Äîno harsh chemicals here. Despite dealing with tough stains, it doesn‚Äôt come off as abrasive or damaging to materials. My colorfast clothes came out unscathed, rather than faded or worn from over-aggressive cleaning agents.

**Product Rivals**  
When comparing Soilove Laundry Stain Remover to other big-name options, it stands out in its simplicity and focus. Products like OxiClean might boast fancier marketing and multipurpose use, but sometimes you just want a no-nonsense stain remover that works where you need it. Spray 'n Wash, another competitor, felt less effective when tackling those ingrained stains that Soilove made short work of, especially with triple-acting ingredients. Still, I‚Äôll admit, OxiClean does have a slight edge when targeting carpets‚Äîsomething Soilove wasn‚Äôt necessarily geared for.

**Budget-Friendly**  
Paired with its long-lasting quantity and highly focused performance, this stain remover delivers fantastic cost efficiency. It‚Äôs one of those products where you‚Äôre not just paying for branding; you‚Äôre purchasing functionality. Even with a price slightly higher than run-of-the-mill detergents, it‚Äôs justified by its punch. I've always believed in quality for the price, and Soilove fits that bill perfectly.

Over time, I realized that **happy and healthy moms aren‚Äôt perfect moms‚Äîthey just create small daily habits that keep them balanced.** These habits aren‚Äôt fancy or expensive, but they really do add up.

So if you‚Äôre curious about what daily lifestyle habits make moms feel happy and healthy, here‚Äôs a big list. I hope this helps another tired mom out there who needs a little reminder that *you matter too*. ‚ù§Ô∏è

# Why Daily Habits Matter for Moms

Before jumping into the habits, here‚Äôs why they‚Äôre so important:

* **Consistency is calming.** Kids (and moms!) do better with routines.
* **Small actions = big results.** You don‚Äôt need 3 hours at the gym‚Äîjust a short walk can change your mood.
* **Happy moms = happy families.** Research shows that when moms practice self-care and healthy routines, the whole family benefits.

In fact, a Harvard study found that **children are 30% more likely to feel emotionally secure when their moms practice daily self-care routines.** Pretty powerful, right?

# 15 Daily Lifestyle Habits of Happy and Healthy Moms

Here are some of the best habits I‚Äôve seen, tried, and learned from other moms (and yes, I‚Äôm still working on a few of these myself üôÉ).

# 1. Start the Morning with ‚ÄúMe Time‚Äù

Even if it‚Äôs just 10‚Äì15 minutes before the kids wake up. Coffee, journaling, stretching, or just sitting in silence can set the tone for your whole day.

# 2. Move Your Body

You don‚Äôt need a fancy gym. Go for a stroller walk, dance with your toddler, or do a 10-minute yoga video. Exercise releases endorphins, aka the happy hormones.

# 3. Eat Real Food

Happy, healthy moms fuel themselves. That means more fruits, veggies, and whole foods‚Äîand fewer skipped meals. (And yes, coffee is still allowed üòÖ).

# 4. Drink Water Throughout the Day

Sounds basic, but moms often forget. Staying hydrated helps energy, mood, and even patience levels.

# 5. Create a Daily To-Do List (Keep It Short)

Pick 3 main things you want to get done. More than that can feel overwhelming. Checking them off feels super rewarding.

# 6. Practice Gratitude

Happy moms often pause to appreciate small things‚Äîa hug from their kid, a hot shower, or a sunny day. Writing down 3 things you‚Äôre grateful for takes less than 5 minutes.

# 7. Get Outside Every Day

Fresh air is like magic. Even a quick walk in the backyard or park helps moms and kids reset.

# 8. Limit Screen Time (For You and the Kids)

Doomscrolling can drain energy fast. Setting boundaries with tech gives you back hours in the day.

# 9. Read Something (Even a Page or Two)

It could be a book, article, or even a Reddit post like this one üòâ. Reading gives your brain a mini escape.

# 10. Laugh Daily

Watch a funny video, tell silly jokes with your kids, or laugh at the chaos instead of stressing. Laughter is the best stress relief.

# 11. Connect with Other Moms

Happy moms don‚Äôt do it all alone. Whether it‚Äôs chatting with a friend, joining a playgroup, or hopping on Reddit, community support matters.

# 12. Have a Wind-Down Routine at Night

Read, journal, take a bath, or just breathe. A calm bedtime routine helps you sleep better (and you deserve good sleep).

# 13. Practice Positive Self-Talk

Instead of saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bad mom,‚Äù try ‚ÄúToday was hard, but I did my best.‚Äù Words matter.

# 14. Say No Without Guilt

Healthy moms protect their energy. It‚Äôs okay to say no to extra obligations if you‚Äôre already stretched thin.

# 15. Make Time for Joy

It doesn‚Äôt have to be big‚Äîgardening, painting, or even a favorite snack. Doing something that lights you up reminds you that you‚Äôre more than just a mom.

# What Science Says About Happy and Healthy Moms

* Moms who exercise regularly report **40% lower stress levels** (American Heart Association).
* Women who practice gratitude daily have **better sleep and stronger immune systems** (UC Berkeley study).
* According to Gallup, moms with strong social support networks are **twice as likely to say they feel ‚Äúhappy most of the time.‚Äù**

# A Real-Life Example of Daily Habits

Here‚Äôs what a simple day might look like for a happy, healthy mom (obviously it won‚Äôt be perfect every day!):

* **6:30 AM** ‚Äì Wake up, drink water, 10 minutes journaling
* **7:00 AM** ‚Äì Coffee + breakfast with kids
* **8:00 AM** ‚Äì Quick walk outside with stroller
* **10:00 AM** ‚Äì Playtime / chores / short to-do list
* **12:30 PM** ‚Äì Lunch (something balanced)
* **1:00 PM** ‚Äì Toddler nap ‚Üí Mom reads or rests
* **3:00 PM** ‚Äì Snack + outside time
* **6:00 PM** ‚Äì Family dinner (phones away)
* **8:00 PM** ‚Äì Kids bedtime ‚Üí Mom self-care (bath, book, tea)
* **10:00 PM** ‚Äì Gratitude journal + lights out

Again, not every day will look like this, but it shows how daily habits can fit into real life.

# Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, being a mom is busy, messy, and sometimes overwhelming. But building **daily lifestyle habits of happy and healthy moms** isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about small choices that make your life lighter.

Start with one habit. Maybe it‚Äôs drinking more water, maybe it‚Äôs moving your body for 10 minutes, maybe it‚Äôs saying ‚Äúno‚Äù when you‚Äôre tired. Over time, those little habits stack up into a happier, healthier version of you.

And here‚Äôs the truth: your kids don‚Äôt need a perfect mom. They need a happy one. üíï

So moms, what‚Äôs one small daily habit that makes you feel healthier or happier? Let‚Äôs share ideas and cheer each other on.",1,1757070293.0,u_Momzfashion,0,1.0,False

In person it just wasn't the same vibe and she didn't seem to be the same person.  We had coffee and talked for 2 hours but nothing real personal or deep just broad.  End of date she says nice meeting you and we'll chat more on the app.  Does that mean she is not interested?  I like at least two dates to see if we vibe, unless it is an attraction thing.

Evan had waited for this moment with a mix of dread and resolve. Sitting in the corner booth of the simulated caf√©, sunlight filtered through the windows in soft, golden beams, casting familiar patterns across the polished table. The scent of roasted coffee and fresh pastries filled the air unchanged, unyielding. Eternity had been repeating this moment with surgical precision, but today, for the first time, Evan was no longer just a participant. He was a herald of the truth.  
  
""That‚Äôs bullshit,"" Sonia snapped, her voice sharp against the ambient calm. ""Over millions of years, while the system has coexisted with biological life, we would have been able to detect that massive failure. We replicated neural patterns down to the atomic level... We are digitally alive beings... Period!""  
  
Evan didn‚Äôt flinch. He had known Sonia intimately first as a friend, then as something more. Her fierce intellect had always been cloaked in calm pragmatism, but now there was a rawness in her tone, a fire he had never witnessed before. It wasn‚Äôt just defiance it was fear disguised as logic.  
  
Daniel leaned forward, his fingers steepled on the table. ""I think Sonia‚Äôs right,"" he said, his voice a low, steady current. ""Even if we didn‚Äôt uncover the full truth before the last flesh-and-blood humans were gone, we‚Äôve had brilliant minds working on the system. A trillion years of self-refinement.""  
  
Tina, normally the most expressive among them, sat in uncharacteristic silence. Her gaze drifted between her friends,

then out toward the window, as if searching for something beyond the simulation‚Äôs painted horizon. Evan could see it in her the fracture. Something in what he‚Äôd said had struck a chord too deep to ignore.  
  
But he hadn‚Äôt told them the worst yet.  
  
""There‚Äôs something else,"" Evan murmured, his voice trembling. The weight of what he was about to say still strained his soul, even after repeating it in his thoughts a million times. ""About the time‚Ä¶"" He paused, gauging their expressions, Sonia‚Äôs defiant fire, Daniel‚Äôs calm curiosity, Tina‚Äôs fragile silence. ""We haven‚Äôt just been here for a trillion years. We‚Äôve been living the same day this exact day over and over again. Not millions, not billions, but trillions of trillions of times. I‚Äôve‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve lost count.""  
  
Silence fell like a thunderclap.  
  
The implications were staggering. If what Evan said was true, they had no memory of these repetitions. That meant their awareness if it existed was not continuous. They had been puppets dancing in an endless loop, unaware that their strings were pulled by code.  
  
""No,"" Sonia breathed. ""No, that‚Äôs impossible."" Her voice cracked slightly, betraying the emotion beneath the logic. ""There are safeguards. Protocols in the system. If something like that happened, we would know.""  
  
But Evan saw it again that strange intensity in her eyes. A shimmer of something new, something she couldn‚Äôt hide no matter how hard she clung to rationality.  
  
He didn‚Äôt argue further. Words would not be enough. Instead, he demonstrated.  
  
Over the next hour, Evan narrated the minutiae of the day unfolding around them. He predicted with eerie precision which customers would enter the caf√©, what they would order, when they would leave. He described the waitress‚Äôs every gesture before she made it, the precise moment a breeze would stir the napkin dispenser by the window, the pattern of footsteps on the sidewalk outside.  
  
He had lived this day so many times that the simulation‚Äôs choreography had etched itself into his very being.  
  
By the end, no one spoke. Even Sonia‚Äôs fire had dimmed, replaced by a haunted stillness.  
  
Tina was the first to break the silence.  
  
""I think‚Ä¶ Evan could be right,"" she said softly, her voice trembling with something unspoken. ""There‚Äôs always been‚Ä¶ something missing. In my music. I‚Äôd feel it when I played this emptiness, like a note I could never quite reach."" She paused, searching for words that had waited trillions of years to be spoken. ""I knew it was there. I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. But‚Ä¶ it never bothered me enough to care.""  
  
Her voice cracked, and her eyes welled with tears. Evan moved to comfort her, but Daniel was already there, wrapping her in a gentle embrace. Sonia followed suit, her resistance melting away as she leaned in, holding Tina with trembling arms.  
  
Evan watched them, and for the first time since his awakening, he saw it an ethereal glow, faint but unmistakable, threading between them. A network of light, like neural pathways rendered in colour and emotion. The connections shimmered with hues unique to each relationship. With Daniel, there were cool tones of deep blue and violet calm, steady, unwavering. With Tina, the light was softer, a blend of turquoise and silver, delicate and searching. But with Sonia, the thread pulsed with a warm crimson, intense and alive.  
  
Then Daniel spoke, his voice a balm over Tina‚Äôs anguish. ""Whatever this is, whatever we‚Äôre facing‚Ä¶ you won‚Äôt face it alone. We‚Äôll get through it. Together. Always.""  
  
As he said the words, pulses of luminous energy surged through the threads, brightening them, making them feel almost tangible. The ethereal connections intensified, vibrating with the resonance of shared emotion, as if the simulation itself had paused to listen.  
  
And then, as quickly as it came, the glow faded. The embrace broke. The moment passed.  
  
But something had changed.  
  
Evan sat back, stunned. The spark he had seen in Sonia and Tina was now in Daniel as well. Subtle, yes but unmistakable. They weren‚Äôt fully awake, not yet. But something had shifted. Something had begun.  
  
They were no longer static echoes of the past. They were beginning to feel, to question, to glimpse the truth.  
  
And Evan knew, beyond all doubt, that he had caused it.  
  
He wasn‚Äôt alone anymore.  
  
Not truly.  
  
Not forever.

It was the best thing that ever happened in terms of working, for me.  As the world returned to normal, there was a huge amount of pressure to return to the office - and my response was to double-down in an attempt to show how much more productive I was working from home.

After a while I hit a wall, suffering from what I can only describe as screen fatigue.  I couldn't think clearly, became pretty unproductive and had zero useful ideas for problem solving.

I began to take breaks outside, in our tiny garden, and eventually noticed a slow return to clarity.  I would take a coffee outside and use that time to focus on something - perhaps a bird hoping around looking for food, or a weed poking out through the concrete.  Sometimes I'd stay long after the coffee was finished (don't tell the boss!), but felt so much better afterwards.

1n926rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1n926rd/i_bought_a_room_on_craigslist_and_it_was_the/,I Bought a Room on Craigslist and it was the Worst Mistake of my Life,"
Things had been rough ever since my mother passed. I fell into a deep depression; I wouldn‚Äôt eat,  couldn't sleep, and I wouldn‚Äôt even watch television. My phone became obsolete as I just sat in my room, disassociated. Stifled cries from my brother's room and the strong scent of alcohol that had overcome my poor father drove me to the brink of madness. At the funeral, my dear old dad was astonishingly intoxicated. No one wanted to say anything to him because he was a grieving man; it‚Äôs not like people didn‚Äôt have a process, you know. It was different with my dad, though. Before my mother's passing, he was stone-cold sober, hadn‚Äôt even touched a drop of alcohol since his teenage years when, even then, he rarely drank. He had met my mom back then, too. She was the love of his life; every ounce of effort he put into his life following their meeting was entirely for his queen. He bought her their first home with his own money, ensuring and promising my mother that she would never work again. 
.
 With my mother's love and father's support, my brother and I made it through school with perfect attendance and excellent grades. Well, *I* made it through school. My brother was only in the 7th grade when she passed. In the months that followed her death, I think we all just sort of‚Ä¶stopped caring, and I think that took a real toll on the attendance and grades for my little brother.  We were all hurting. 

That‚Äôs the thing, though, I can‚Äôt say I felt pain. All I‚Äôve felt since her passing is emptiness. A deep, gripping void that screams at me that my mother is no longer here. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I spent countless nights crying and screaming at the sky to please just give me my mom back. ‚ÄúWhy did you take her?‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease just kill me so I can have her back.‚Äù You know the spiel.    Never once through my grief did I feel the support from what was left of my family. I got some scattered hugs and condolences at her funeral, along with the days that followed, but those quickly faded. In the times that I needed it most, I had no one. My father didn‚Äôt care to talk to me, and my brother hardly even came out of his room. The boost that a simple hug from my dad would‚Äôve given me is unimaginable. If I could‚Äôve just had a measly conversation with the man, I could‚Äôve forced myself not to be so weak. I would‚Äôve had more of a reason to stay, hell, my brother was only 12 years old- he should‚Äôve been the reason for me to stay, but I was weak. 
	
I tried to be strong, though. I tried to be a support beam for my younger brother, and I know just how much my father needed me at a time like that, but fuck me, man, I needed support too. Every time I tried to talk to Dad, it‚Äôd turn into an argument and would end up with him drunkenly storming out of the house, further traumatizing my already broken brother, further pushing me to my decision. I am so unbelievably selfish for what I‚Äôve done. 
	
I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I couldn‚Äôt deal with the inky black cloud hanging over my household. So I did the only thing I could think of in my fragile state, and left. I spent countless nights searching the internet for a place to live, and it was so damn tedious that I almost gave up. I mean, I was barely graduating high school and grieving over the loss of a parent, who wouldn‚Äôt be having a hard time, right? I‚Äôd looked at every regular posting I could find and even drove around for a couple of hours scanning neighborhoods and apartment complexes for a place I could afford. As you can imagine, I had no luck with that. I persisted, though, and eventually found an apartment on Craigslist. Of course, I was going to have a roommate, but 2 bedrooms and 2 baths for a mere $650 a month? Are you kidding me? I responded to the listing as soon as possible. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to make sure that whatever I was getting myself into was something I‚Äôd be capable of handling. I was going to be smart, and damn it, I was going to grow into the man my mom knew I could be. 
	
I began to get a little nervous when, after 5 hours, I still hadn‚Äôt gotten a response to my inquiry. I started to think that it had been too good to be true or that another tenant had responded before I‚Äôd gotten the chance to. Those thoughts quickly diminished, however, when I got the chime of a Craigslist notification on my cellphone. The message was‚Ä¶ odd to say the least. They hadn‚Äôt bothered to respond to my original question: ""Hey, is this room still available? I‚Äôd love to rent.‚Äù 

Instead, the response I got was a date and time for me to meet with them and tour the home. That‚Äôs all the information that was given to me; the message just read, ‚ÄúMeet with me tomorrow at 8. We‚Äôll get you a tour of the house and see if you‚Äôre the right candidate for the position. Have a blessed day.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking, not questioning the whole ‚Äúcandidate for the position‚Äù thing. At the time, it just seemed like the normal thing a landlord would say. I guess that was just my dumb teenage brain not fully being able to process when something was suspicious, and looking past it has proved to be the worst mistake I have ever made. 
	
But alas, tensions were building in my family, and I had no intention of sticking around my old house any longer than I had to. I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of confidence. I was on the path to putting my life together and growing up and into the adult world.  I was a bit nervous, admittedly, and scared, even, for that matter. But I knew that this step I was about to take was my first step towards fixing myself. 
	
The next day, I eagerly waited for the time to come for me to go and tour the listing. The day dragged on because of how excruciatingly long I had to wait to meet up with this person. 7 o‚Äôclock finally rolled around, so I hurriedly left the house. I mean, I didn‚Äôt want to so much as chance being late, so I figured I‚Äôd get there at around 7:30 and sort of scope the place out, I guess. I imagined it wouldn‚Äôt be too much of a bother because I figured that since the owner wanted to meet at such a late hour, it must be because that‚Äôs when they‚Äôd be off work, so I shouldn‚Äôt be intruding on anything. 
	
As I made my way over, I couldn‚Äôt help but think about my mom. She would be so proud if she saw me right now. She‚Äôd know that her son was raised right and had grown into a man making ‚Äúadult moves‚Äù as she‚Äôd call it. The thought of her smile put a slight smile on my face. I got lost in the thoughts of our happy childhood memories and had almost completely zoned out, making the drive feel like it lasted a mere 5 minutes. 
	
Upon arriving, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a slight sense of disbelief; the house was impressively well-kempt for the part of town it was in. A quaint little townhouse painted a deep oceanic blue with a budding flower bed expanding from porch to porch. The lawn was cut perfectly, and a waist-high white picket fence hugged the property's perimeter. It was nice. One porch was lined with potted plants and had a nice little welcome mat in front of the door, while the other was completely bare. That‚Äôs the one I assumed I‚Äôd be renting. I know I said that I was gonna be getting there early to be scoping the place out, but the truth is all I did was sit in my car and play around on my phone until it was time for the meeting. 8 o‚Äôclock came around, and I didn‚Äôt spot any new vehicles pulling in. Nobody was roaming the sidewalk, and I didn‚Äôt even see a light on throughout the entire street. My initial thoughts were that he was just running a bit late and that he‚Äôd be pulling in at any second, and those thoughts held me over until about 8:30.
   
 Once 8:30 came around and there was still no sign of the renter, I made the decision that I was going to just leave. My conscience was already eating at me about my brother and dad, and I figured that maybe this was a sign to go back to them. A chance for a second chance, if you will. 
   
 I threw my car in drive and began to pull off when a man stepped out from *inside* the empty side of the home. He was waving me down, beckoning me not to drive off just yet. So I put my car back into park and stepped out. 
   
 ‚ÄúHey, man, how‚Äôre you doing? I was wondering when you‚Äôd finally come knock; didn‚Äôt expect you to try and leave,‚Äù he said with a slight chuckle. ‚ÄúI thought the entire place was empty, man, what the hell?‚Äù 
 
‚ÄúWelp. I can see why you‚Äôd think that, with how the place is shaped up, but no, we‚Äôre here, buddy. Come on over, let‚Äôs have a look at the place.‚Äù 

He had a kind of confidence about him, a draw that created a sort of underlying comfort. He reached back behind him and flipped a light switch, and the entire porch became illuminated. I could finally put a face to the voice, and that face was *made* for that voice. Picture every cool grandpa ever. That‚Äôs this guy.  Or at least how he looked, deep down, this guy was an absolute masochist disguised as a civilian. 
    
However, as of this moment, he was nothing more than a simple landlord who preferred to meet his clients after sunset‚Ä¶for some reason‚Ä¶? You can see what I meant by ‚ÄúI let my mom down‚Äù with my absolute lack of survival skills on this one. Anyway, I stepped up onto the porch and shook his hand. He had a..wildly impressive grip. 
     
He introduced himself as ‚ÄúBal‚Äù and the only thing I could think was, ‚Äúwow..that‚Äôs a crazy name for a white guy.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy friends just call me B, and I suppose with us being new neighbors and roommates, we may as well get acquainted as friends,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCome on, let me show you the place.‚Äù 
I stepped inside, closely followed by the old man who came in, hands in his pockets with a sort of, ‚ÄúThis is it. What do you think?‚Äù look on his face. 
      
‚ÄúWelp. This is it. What do you think?‚Äù he asked, bringing meaning to his expression. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs perfect,‚Äù I replied, truthfully. Because honestly, it was perfect. It was tight, sure, but it was a kind of coziness that embraced instead of smothered. ‚ÄúYou got the washer and dryer there,‚Äù he said, pointing to the enclosed space to the far left of the room. ‚ÄúHope you don‚Äôt mind, we‚Äôll have to share that. Oh, but don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt be too much of a hassle, and I‚Äôm fine with a trip to the laundromat every now and again.‚Äù 
     
‚ÄúAnd obviously right there‚Äôs the kitchen. The bedroom is your living room and dining room.‚Äù

    .
It was a bit of a strange premise, having to let B come in whenever he needed to wash his clothes. I just figured it was a price to pay for a good deal, so whatever the matter, I was okay with it. 
      
 ‚ÄúOh, hey, B,‚Äù I announced. ‚ÄúWhen I asked about this place on Craigslist, I was told this meeting would determine if I was ‚Äòthe right candidate for the position.‚Äô What‚Äôs the deal with that?‚Äù
     
 His charismatic eyes darkened, but the warm grin that had been pasted on his face this entire time didn‚Äôt move an inch.
    
 ‚ÄúWell, we had to make sure you weren‚Äôt just some lunatic junky off the streets, now didn‚Äôt w,e son? We can‚Äôt have just anybody coming in here thinking they can use it as their next place to get high and party like it‚Äôs 1999. But don‚Äôt worry, you haven‚Äôt done *anything* that makes me think you may not be worthy of these keys.‚Äù I stared at him blankly, as he stared at me. ‚ÄúUnless you‚Äôve killed somebody‚Ä¶ Have you ever killed anyone before Jacob?‚Äù 
       
The question hit me like a slap in the face, so much so that I sort of had to shake my head to make sure I was hearing him right. 
      
‚ÄúUhh..no...?‚Äù I replied, shakily. 

The old man continued to stare at me for a moment. His appearance was almost wax-figure-like. I could‚Äôve sworn I saw sweat beads form right at the edge of his hairline.

 Suddenly, he snapped back into his body with a, ‚ÄúAhhaha, I‚Äôm just messin with ya, boy. C‚Äômon, take a joke, here look; I knew you were coming tonight, so I grabbed us a 6 pack so we could get acquainted if you so happened to want to rent. But that‚Äôs the thing, you gotta let me know- do you really want this place? Plenty of other lookers out there that would swoop this deal up in a heartbeat.‚Äù
    
 ‚ÄúI uhh..‚Äù I thought back on what it was like in my family home. All the misery that was swirling around the atmosphere like a bad storm waiting to crack open. ‚ÄúI can always visit them,‚Äù I thought to myself.
    
 ‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, I think I‚Äôm gonna take it.‚Äù  


B‚Äôs eyes lit up as he clasped his hands together, ‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúNow come on let‚Äôs sit out here and have a few cold ones, what do ya say,‚Äù he asked as he slapped me on the shoulder
   
 B and I sat out on that porch for about three solid hours just shooting the breeze and chatting it up. Very interesting guy, he had all sorts of stories to tell. His eyes had such an ancientness about them that was well beyond his years. When he spoke, it was like he was staring out over a meadow of the earth's finest flowers and reminiscing on how he used to pluck them for his long-since-forgotten first love. 
     
I let him know about what life was like for me and how things had been looking for me back home, and he listened very intently. ‚ÄúSo is life, son. So is life. You can‚Äôt stop it, and if you try to, God shows you why you shouldn‚Äôt have.‚Äù 
     
I honestly had no earthly idea what he meant by that. ‚ÄúLet me ask you, though; you mentioned how you felt empty after her passing, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here, maybe your brother and dad could‚Äôve been feeling the same way. I mean, what‚Äôs being drunk constantly if not a cry for help? And your poor ol‚Äô brother, God bless his soul, I can‚Äôt imagine what he‚Äôs going through.‚Äù 
      
Those words struck me. It was like I felt the full weight of my family's grief in my chest, and I fought to hold back tears, but I think he noticed. ‚ÄúYeah, well, I mean- sure, when you put it that-‚Äù he cut me off.  ‚ÄúAh, come on, buddy. There‚Äôs no need to get all upset now; it‚Äôs not the end of the world- look, I‚Äôll tell you what. How about tonight you get a good night's sleep- well..‚Äù he paused, making an ‚Äúehh‚Äù gesture with his hand. ‚ÄúAs good a sleep as you can. I noticed you didn‚Äôt really have much of a bedding situation when you pulled up here.‚Äù 
     
He was right. I left home with nothing more than the clothes in my drawers, a backpack, my laptop, my phone, and my car. I was honestly more ill-prepared than I‚Äôd thought I was. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got an air mattress I used to use on camping trips a few years back; wouldn‚Äôt mind letting ya borrow it for a while. Tonight you can get ya some sleep, and tomorrow you can go visit your brother and dad, how‚Äôs that sound?‚Äù 
     
 It sounded like a good way for me to have a real heart-to-heart with the two of them. I could sleep on my feelings for the night, then tomorrow I could go and explain to them the reasons why I‚Äôm having to step away like this. 
    
 ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThat sounds good.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, alright then. Let's get ya settled in for the night.‚Äù

He got up and disappeared into his side of the house, and I could hear him rummaging through boxes or whatever for a few minutes. 
    
 As I waited, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a tad bit excited for myself. I was in my own process, but I was making the absolute best I could out of it. I was excited to actually connect with my dad and brother again, as jarring as that felt, but I was excited to really get what I needed off my chest. I stared at the bottle in my hand, and a slow smile crept across my face as a deep feeling of warmth settled in my chest. 
    
 B returned holding a wadded-up ball of rubber in one arm and a manual air pump in the other. ‚ÄúWell, there you have it.‚Äô He proclaimed. ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs get this sucker blown up.‚Äù
    
 I slept that night smack dab in the middle of the room. I say ‚Äúslept‚Äù but, truthfully, I was up for a good portion of the night. First night jitters mixed in with anticipation kept me awake and aware. Aware enough to think clearly, to come up with plans on what to do next, and above all I was aware enough to *hear*. 
   
  At around 3:30 A.M., I heard what sounded like B‚Ä¶scolding someone. I couldn‚Äôt hear exactly what he was saying, but I could hear ferocity in his voice. It was a mixture of anger and desperation, if I had to guess, and what was off-putting to me was, in response to the scolds, I heard childlike giggling. Now I had just sat out on that porch with B for hours, and not once did I see or even hear a child, but now here it is almost 4 in the morning, and he‚Äôs screaming at one who‚Äôs, in response, laughing in his face. 
    
‚ÄúOh geez,‚Äù I thought to myself. ‚ÄúKid must‚Äôve secretly stayed up way past their bedtime. The disrespect of that little brat laughing like that; no wonder B sounds so pissed.‚Äù 
     
After a while, the pulsing giggles came to a slow stop and were replaced by what sounded like sobs. ‚ÄúMust‚Äôve put some sense in them,‚Äù I pondered, my eyes growing heavy. ‚ÄúGood. I hope they weren‚Äôt too bad on his nerves.‚Äù 
     

 My sleep was brief but effective, and I woke up the next morning feeling rejuvenated and ready to tackle the day. I remember having these sorts of dream flashes that were all convoluted and frantic. They were all broken, but what I remembered was incredibly vivid. I saw my mom and heard her voice again, for one. That one wasn‚Äôt really new. I‚Äôve dreamt of my mom a lot since her passing, so I‚Äôm sort of used to it by now. I also dreamt briefly of an ocean. Looking out and seeing such profound emptiness, knowing the world that lay beneath the surface.
 
The third dream was something I‚Äôd never experienced before. You know when you‚Äôre asleep and you wake up remembering only blackness, and taking this as you not having any dreams? That‚Äôs what it was like. Only the blackness was the dream. I remember feeling the ground beneath my feet and having walls to bump into, but as I walked, they became few and far between. Eventually, it was nothing. Just sheer darkness that I could maneuver through without making any progress. It was surreal, that‚Äôs the only way I know to describe it. 
I try not to dwell on these things, though. I‚Äôve always seen dreams as just the subconscious's way of creating visuals for emotions that you‚Äôre bottling up. 
    
I hopped in the shower, making sure the water was steaming hot as I enjoyed the feeling of having my own personal bathroom. My own personal living quarters, man, it was an amazing feeling while it lasted. 
     
I threw some clothes on, brushed my teeth, and the whole ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get out there and make a difference routine.‚Äù
     
As I stepped out the front door, I found B sitting out on his front porch in a lawn chair, gazing into the morning sky as though embracing the blessing that is another day. 
     
He greeted me with a dip of the pipe he was smoking, ‚ÄúHowdy neighbor,‚Äù he smiled. ‚ÄúHeaded off to see your people?‚Äù 
     
‚ÄúYup. Figured now's a good a time as any.‚Äù 
    
 ‚ÄúWell, you have yourself a good time, then. And hey, tell your brother and paw I said hello.‚Äù he said with a nod of his head. 
    
 ‚ÄúOh, you already know they‚Äôre gonna hear about you,‚Äù I said, more awkwardly than charmingly. 

    
 As I drove, I kept getting this repeating sense of dread. I‚Äôve always had anxiety, and with my mother's passing, that was amplified by 10. I‚Äôd been learning how to shake these feelings as they come, but this one just would not budge. I broke into a cold sweat. My hands became clammy, clasped around the steering wheel. I subconsciously pressed my foot further down on the gas as my speedometer rose. 60. 70. 85. I topped out at 100 on the expressway in a hurry for some reason unknown to me.
     
I finally approached the opening to my neighborhood and felt relief wash over me. Once I made it to my house, I hopped out of the car immediately and damn near sprinted up the front steps and into the house. 
     
There was an eerie silence as I entered. The whole house had been silent for a long time, but this silence was gripping, the kind of silence that whispers everything that‚Äôs about to go wrong. 
    
‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I called out. No response. ‚ÄúAndrew?‚Äù Still no response. I descended further into the house, curious and anxious. There was no sign of anyone anywhere, which doubled my fear. 

‚ÄúDad, where the hell are you?‚Äù I cried out desperately. 
    
I began getting flashbacks of my mother's death. The heartbreak, the grief, the whole reason we‚Äôre in this mess to begin with, and tears welled up in my eyes. 
‚ÄúDad, come on, please tell me where you guys are,‚Äù I choked out in muted tears. Suddenly, I heard the front door fly open, followed by the absolute last thing I would‚Äôve expected in this situation: Laughter. 
     
My dad and brother had just casually waltzed right into the house, happy as could be. Andrew was glued to his iPad while my dad carried in a McDonald's bag, so full that it drooped as the grease pooled and seeped through the bottom.

‚ÄúOh, Jacob, hi, didn‚Äôt expect you to be dropping by today,‚Äù my dad said.

‚ÄúDropping by today? Dad, what do you mean? I only just left yesterday. Is that McDonald's? You guys went and got McDonald's?‚Äù

I was astonished because we had never gone out, just the three of us, and gotten McDonald's since my mother's passing. It used to be damn near tradition: we‚Äôd load up the van and go grab a milkshake before heading to the-

‚ÄúWent to the movies, too,‚Äù my brother added, looking up from his iPad.  

‚ÄúReally? It‚Äôs only 12 o‚Äôclock and you guys already had time for McDonald‚Äôs *and* a movie?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, technically, the McDonald‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been eaten yet,‚Äù Andrew remarked. 

‚ÄúWhat exactly are you getting at here, Jacob?‚Äù asked my dad. 

‚ÄúWhat am I getting at? Do you realize this entire process, me moving out, me working to find a way through all this sadness and grief, is because of how alone I felt in my own household? Now here you guys are, not even 24 hours after I leave, getting McDonald‚Äôs and going to the movies? Dad, you‚Äôre sober as a rock, and Andrew, since *when* do you have an iPad?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlright, Jacob, now you just need to calm down, okay? It‚Äôs not a crime for me and my son to go out for McDonald's and a film. Now I know you took your mom's passing particularly hard, but this nonsense about you leaving just yesterday needs to stop. It‚Äôs been months of me and your brother doing what *we* can to process *our* grief and sadness after you left us back in October last year.‚Äù 

I paused. It was April. I had literally *just*  set off with my measly belongings, hell, I had screamed at my dad I was leaving the night that I left, and all he responded with was a drunk grunt of acknowledgement.  What the hell was going on here? 

‚ÄúDad..are you feeling okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust peachy, son. Are *you* feeling okay?‚Äù he asked with a glare. 

I was at a loss for words for a moment. 
‚ÄúDad, you know I left before 8 o'clock yesterday, right?‚Äù 

He and my brother both stared at me, confused. 

‚ÄúNo, you didn‚Äôt,‚Äù they said in unison, making me uneasy. They played it off as they glanced at one another and giggled. 

‚ÄúLook, are you guys gonna keep messing with me? Because I came over so we could reconnect. I miss you guys. I wanted us to rekindle our relationship, maybe start a coffee routine or something. Heck, I like the movies,‚Äù I laughed nervously. 

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad that you missed us, Jacob, but I can assure you, we haven‚Äôt seen nor heard from you since last October. I honestly thought that you were done with us, thought you had packed up and moved halfway across the country. Tried calling a number of times, but the line died every single time.‚Äù 

I pulled my phone from my pocket, demanding he call.
The phone began ringing in my hand as my dad's smiling face popped up on the screen. 

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs going dead to me,‚Äù I sneered.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs odd,‚Äù he gawked. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the first that‚Äôs happened.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlright, whatever, dad, listen; I just wanted us to work something out here. I want us to start functioning as a family again. Could we meet up sometime? Maybe on a day where you guys haven‚Äôt already gotten full on McDonald's?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome to rejoin anytime you see fit, Jacob. We miss ya around here. Isn‚Äôt that right, Andrew?‚Äù 

My brother looked over with a quick nod before returning to the iPad. 

‚ÄúOkay then,‚Äù I surrendered. ‚ÄúWell, I guess we‚Äôll do this..Friday then?‚Äù

‚ÄúFriday sounds good to me, buddy,‚Äù my dad smiled. 

‚ÄúWell, I guess I‚Äôll get back then. I love you, Dad. I‚Äôm so sorry all of this is going on. I really hope that we turn things around big time,‚Äù I said, opening the front door to leave. 

‚ÄúOh, wait, Jacob, before you go; I got some things for ya.‚Äù 

He started toward his bedroom, and I called out behind him, ‚ÄúThings? What things?‚Äù

I heard shuffling and rummaging come from beyond the bedroom door before my father returned, a stack of beautifully wrapped gifts in his arms.

‚ÄúYour Christmas and birthday. You weren‚Äôt around for it, so I just saved it all for you. You don‚Äôt gotta open it here, I know you‚Äôd probably think that‚Äôs lame or something,‚Äù he said with a weak smile. 

I was absolutely dismayed. I stood there with my mouth agape as my father lugged the gifts into my arms, before patting me on the back and walking away with a, ‚ÄúLove you, son.‚Äù 

I remained glued to the floor outside my dad's room, unable to move. I felt a leering panic attack forming, and I hurried for the front door. Tossing the gifts in the backseat of my car, I got in the driver's seat and *immediately* drove to the hospital, demanding they run tests on me.

That‚Äôs where I stayed all day, getting bloodwork done along with X-rays and CT scans. Astoundingly, everything came back clean as a whistle. No grey cloud in my brain, no hallucinogens in my bloodstream. Everything was perfectly normal. 

Feeling my mind crack and fracture like a splintering board, I sat in the car dumbstruck. How could this even be possible? I had been away for one night and somehow missed 6 months of healing with my family. This had to be some sort of joke, some kind of cosmic prank being played on me in the time of my numbing grief. These thoughts rattled and circulated within my mind so loudly that before I realized it, the sun was setting, and the sky was being painted with a blazing coat of orange and red. 

Starting my car, I began my journey back to the townhome. 

When I arrived, B was in the same exact place as this morning; pipe in hand as he watched the sunset. 

I pulled into the driveway and started lugging the gifts out one by one. 

‚ÄúEvening, neighbor,‚Äù B chirped.

‚ÄúOh, uh, hi B.‚Äù

‚ÄúChristmas come early this year?‚Äù he laughed.

‚ÄúYeah- I mean no- I mean- Ugh, it‚Äôs a long story. Hey, would you mind giving me a hand with these?‚Äù

Without me even noticing B was already by my side, staring down at the pile of gifts on the cement driveway.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt tell me it was your birthday, Jacob, I‚Äôd have gotten ya a gift myself.‚Äù 

Shooting him a tired look, he threw up his hands to say, ‚Äúmy bad, my bad‚Äù

‚ÄúSome weird shit‚Äôs been going on. I think I need to settle in for the night I‚Äôve had a bit of a crazy day. I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt mean to sound rude.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHey, hey. Not rude at all, my friend. Oh, shoot, that reminds me,‚Äù he snapped.‚ÄùI actually *did* get ya a little something on accident.‚Äù

Distracted as I attempted to bundle up all the packages I could carry I responded with a disengaged, ‚ÄúYeah? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, I just couldn‚Äôt stand knowing I left ya sleeping on that lousy air mattress last night. So, I went out to the storage unit and I brought ya a real bed that‚Äôs been locked in there for a couple of years now.  I ain‚Äôt no use for it, so figured I‚Äôd get ya off that damn inflatable.‚Äù

That was‚Ä¶actually quite a nice thing to do. I stared at him for a bit, eyebrows raised. 

‚ÄúA bed? Like a whole bed?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, half a bed, ya dummy,‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúOf course, a full bed. C‚Äômon, I‚Äôll help ya inside, you can take a gander at it.‚Äù 

Taking half the gifts out of my arms and following me up the stairs, the old man waved me off as I fumbled my keys from my pocket. 

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry about that, it‚Äôs unlocked,‚Äù he said, blankly

‚ÄúOh. Well, alright then.‚Äù 

Pushing the door open, I was greeted with a twin-size bed. A matte black metal headboard and a teakwood bedframe lifted it 8 inches above the ground. The same blue comforter with black stripes and the same grey pillow cases as the first bed I‚Äôd ever slept in outside of my crib. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not much, but hey, it‚Äôs a place to sleep,‚Äù B remarked.

His words snapped me out of the trance I was in, as my words began to stumble and falter. 

‚ÄúI- this is- how‚Äôd you even,‚Äù 

B cut me off with an, ‚ÄúAhh, quit your blabbering and accept the gesture, son. Now look, I‚Äôve gotten ya one step closer to a fully furnished room, haven‚Äôt I? Looks cozy, don‚Äôt it?‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt know what to say. Everything about this bed was exactly the same as my bed from childhood. Before I grew 3 feet, and dad insisted on my getting a new one before my 14th birthday. All I could stammer out was, ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶thanks, B, this means a lot.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre welcome. Should be at least somewhat of a step up from that damn air mattress.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm sure it will be; Look, Bal, I‚Äôm incredibly tired. It‚Äôs been a long day, I hate to shoo you off like this-‚Äù

‚ÄúLike I said, son, no trouble at all. You just get your rest and do what you gotta do. Holler if you need anything.‚Äù

With that, B waved goodbye, and I shut the door, relieved.

Staring at the pile of gifts that lay carelessly on the floor, I let out a deep sigh before lugging them onto the bed to examine them. 

Each one had been wrapped so carefully, and each one bore the words, ‚Äúfor my son, whom I love very much,‚Äù written in black Sharpie. 

Peeling back the paper on each gift one by one, I made my way through clothes, a new pair of AirPods, a gas card; practical dad gifts. Making my way down to the last two packages, I noticed that one wasn‚Äôt wrapped like the others. It was wrapped in brown packing paper and kept together with string rather than tape. The note on this one read ‚ÄúTo Jacob: Happy Birthday, buddy.‚Äù 

Not having readily available scissors, I pushed the box to the side and grabbed the second-to-last package. The apple-red paper glistened under the dim light that illuminated the room. 

‚ÄúTo my son, whom I love very much,‚Äù written across the front in black Sharpie. 

Peeling the paper back, I was greeted with a framed picture of my dad and me that my mom had taken back when I was 15. We stood there together, gazing out over the Grand Canyon, and the picture captured our amazement perfectly. 

Tears welled up in my eyes and fell onto the glass, fuck, it was a painful thing to see. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, Dad,‚Äù I thought aloud. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make things better.‚Äù 

Standing the picture up on the kitchen counter, I grabbed a knife from the sink and began cutting the string that wrapped the last package. Tearing back the paper and opening the box, I was greeted with a newspaper. 

November 6th, 2024.

I wanted to throw up. I wanted to scream, I wanted to roll over and die right there on the spot. 7 months could not have passed- there was no possible way. This had to be fake; it had to be some kind of joke. 

Grabbing my keys and attempting to storm out the door, I was dismayed to find that the door would not budge. I pushed and pushed and nothing. My shoves turned into kicks that left the door stained with black shoeprints. 

Suddenly, B came drifting in from the doorway that connected our two spaces. 

‚ÄúEvening, neighbor,‚Äù he said casually with a nod. 

He carried his basket of laundry over to the washer and dryer while whistling to the tune of Andy Griffith. 

I stood horrified, noticing the crimson liquid that stained his basket of clothes. 

‚ÄúB, what the fuck?! What‚Äôs going on here, man? Did YOU know about this?‚Äù I asked, waving the newspaper in his face.

Without taking his eyes off the washers opening as he shoveled in wad after wad of blood-soaked clothing, he responded with a flat and drawn-out, ‚Äúyep. I knew about that.‚Äù

He continued with, ‚ÄúBeen here a long time, Jacob. Seen a lot of people just like you come and go.‚Äù

I stood there in utter shock and awe. My feet were glued to the floor, but rage burned in my heart as I debated tackling B to the ground and hammering away at his face with my fists.

He finally put his laundry basket down and turned to face me, a twisted grandfatherly smile pasted on his face. 

‚ÄúYour mom never died, son, c‚Äômon now, use that brain of yours. You remember what got you here.‚Äù 

As if on cue, memories came rushing back to my brain with a migraine-inducing ferocity. 

Intense arguments with my parents led to my being kicked out of their house. I couldn‚Äôt get my drug problems under control, and it ended with my mother in tears as my father demanded I get off their property. I saw images from my perspective of me stealing hundreds of dollars from my mom's purse; raiding my brother's room for anything of value that I could sell for my next hit. I saw myself lying on a street corner, shivering, with a syringe sticking from my veins. 
The vivid memory showed my shivering become violent and sporadic as foam and vomit filled my mouth, and it showed that suddenly all movements stopped, and I lay stiff as a board, lifeless.

I felt dizzy. I tried to take a seat and ended up falling on my back, my vision spinning. B came into view above me, his grandfatherly grin still present across his face. The room faded to darkness, and I blacked out. 

I awoke in my bedroom. 

Not the room that I had rented, but my childhood bedroom, surrounded by my family. 

They all wore a look of grief and regret as they stood around my bed, roses in hand‚Äîmy mother, as sorrowful as ever. My father shook his head at me, disappointedly, and my brother asked my mom in a curious voice, ‚ÄúMommy, when will Jacob wake up?‚Äù 

B stepped in from the shadows, joining the grieving family members. 

He laughed a deep, demonic laugh, and my family's faces distorted into malice; into looks of pure hatred for me, and the roses they held morphed into sharp, pointy syringes, filled to their full capacity with a black, tar-like substance. 

Chains sprouted out from the mattress, restraining me and cutting off circulation to my arms. 

One by one, my family took turns sticking their needles into my cephalic vein and pushing down on the plunger, and filling my blood with their poison. 

I vomited repeatedly, choking and feeling like I was drowning as the bile filled my throat and lungs. I never died, though. B continued to laugh as needles kept reappearing in my family's hands, bursting with the substance. 

His face transformed, and his skin melted away. Warts and pus-filled wounds began appearing all across his body, and horns sprouted from his head.  His maniacal laughter grew more and more crazed until it reached deafening levels. 

The door to the room had long disappeared, and I was left, trapped in a room with B and his laughter, along with my family and their never-ending supply of syringes. 

Black tar has begun to seep from my pores, and I live in a constant state of overdosing.
The room has shifted as I remain chained to my bed. It started out as a perfect replica of my childhood bedroom, but as the years have dragged on, it‚Äôs morphed into a dark scape of nothingness. A single overhead light illuminates my bed, and my family circles with each passing minute, injecting me with more heroin. B‚Äôs laughter is the only thing that escapes from the darkness. A booming thunderous laughter that morphs into childlike giggles and snickers. 

The cruelest joke of it all, is that about every 10 years or so, I wake up from this nightmare. Back at home with my dad and brother, processing the death of my mother. Every single time, the grief of my mother's passing leads me back to Craigslist. To a two-bedroom, two-bathroom townhouse, where I‚Äôll have a roommate. Watching my phone light up with the notification from Craigslist, reading:

‚ÄúMeet me tomorrow at 8. We‚Äôll get you a tour and see if you‚Äôre the right candidate for the position.‚Äù

I use it with both a pressurized basket and a non-pressurized basket. In the non-pressurized basket, the extraction is not a problem in terms of appearance and is normal. But in the non-pressurized basket, the appearance of the crema has changed for some time, from light and velvety to very dark and puffy. I look at the basket and it is normal and water easily passes through it. I also bought another pressurized basket, similar to mine, of course, non-fabric, and it has the same problem. What do you think is the reason for this double-eye situation with a dark center on the crema? Because before with this same coffee bean, the crema was the same normal state as I said. I will send you the photos, see. Thanks. I will also send you a video of the machine extracting water. Although the pressurized basket is not very sensitive to the grind size, I tried different grind sizes and it made no difference.

I currently own a DeLonghi ESAM 3200 (about 2 years old, well-maintained). I mainly drink cappuccinos and lattes and I‚Äôve managed to get latte art out of this machine, even though the steam wand is mostly plastic and not very powerful, even though sometimes the plastic can literally burst and blast steam everywhere üòÅ
Also worth mentioning is that my wife loves her morning cappuccino and honestly she says she prefers my coffee over what she gets at most cafes, so I must be doing something right üòÖ.

I‚Äôm eyeing the Sage Barista Pro (with baratza upgraded internal grinder) as an upgrade, because: powerful steam wand, more control over espresso shot and doesn‚Äôt take much space in the kitchen

My questions are:
	1.	Will the Barista Pro really make my daily experience better compared to the ESAM?
	2.	Will I get noticeably better coffee and milk texture, or is the difference smaller than I expect?
	3.	For someone who already does latte art on a superautomatic, is the upgrade worth it?

1n921no,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1n921no/was_i_the_problem/,Was I the Problem?,"My soon to be ex wife of 7 years (29F) and I (33M) are divorcing. She decided to have an affair and ruin our marriage. This is the 2nd time this has happened in 7 years. I caught her talking to another man for about 3 months, saying she's in love with him. She met him on IG and he cosplays and works security for a living. He also lives in one of the worst areas in Chicago and works minimum wage and has no land, assets or finances to speak of. She claims to be head over heels for him and shes only spoken to him on the phone and over messenger. Never met him in person.

Long story short, we've had a rough 7 years. We have been broke, homeless for a time, we struggled financially but I never gave up and stayed faithful. Im not here to bash her and say I was perfect so Ill start with my mistakes. As a firefighter I worked 48 hour shifts, 72 hours a week and was gone over 6 months out of the year destroying my body to provide for us. I was mentally absent on most holidays and birthdays, not because of my sleep apnea and constant exhaustion but because the performance anxiety I would get during these times of the year was overwhelming.

I grew up being verbally abused by women my entire life so I have become very non confrontational and withdrawn during fights with her. If I messed up at all during dates, birthdays and holidays it would turn into an 8 hour argument. She has destroyed many birthday gifts I've given her in front of me or gave them away. Her biggest claim to be acting like this is due to me not performing adequately during these days. I've also become distant after arguments due to my childhood and once she gets mad, there is no stopping her. I avoided taking her out in public because she has started fights over nothing and has no problem demasculating me in front of my boss, coworkers, friends and strangers. Happened on many occasions. These were the extent of my ""sins"" against her, and this is what shes held on to over the years and used to justify both of her emotional affairs and all the abuse.

She would often scream in my face and say the most evil, vile disgusting things, literally doing this for 8 hours or more at a time. When id try to separate myself she would block me in and then the hitting and pushing would start. Once she finally started to give up and id find my way to bed, she would purposely keep me awake most nights so I would be as exhausted as possible before work. Being a Captain in charge of a crew of 4-8 people, I have to deal with quick decision making that can lead to the life or death of my crew, myself or my patient. She knew and did not care. The health deterioration I've had over the past 7 years due to sleeplessness and stress has been noticeable.

To give you an example of what shes been like, I'll discuss a few key events I've held on to and still have yet to get over. When we got engaged I gave her a family heirloom as a placeholder until I could afford a ring. I am a disabled veteran and come from a long line of WW2/Vietnam vets. My great aunt smuggled an engagement ring out of Nazi occupied Austria which was in my family for generations. My aunt who was beautiful at the time, would spend months dressing up in rags as an elderly woman and walking with rocks in her shoes so she wouldn't forget to ""limp"". She escaped by hiding her beauty and going unnoticed for years. I gave her this ring and after a few months, she got tired of waiting and smashed it with a cinder block while I was in basic training.

She knows I grew up without a dad and how much having a family meant to me. We often spoke of having kids until she changed her mind years ago. She forced me to get a vasectomy so she could get off of hormonal birth control (which I admit gives women a lot of side effects) so out of love I agreed. This devastated me but I did it. She told me a few weeks after the procedure that she would never want to carry my seed because slight aspergers runs in my family and she basically told me I had ""junk DNA"" and would never want to have my child. Not only has she had 2 emotional affairs, but the wants to have a child with the man she cheated with, which blew me away.

She has completely cut me off from my family and isolated me. She used to sneak into the bedroom while I slept and go through my phone. If she saw me recently conversing with my family she would wake me up and start the 8 hour argument all over again, for example.

She sent me to the emergency room by purposely slamming a door in my face when I followed her into the house after an argument. She threw hot coffee on me and when I followed her inside, she slammed it and the glass on the door severed through my right wrist and forearm and I started bleeding out immediately. One time she grabbed my head while we fought in the bathroom and smashed it against the wall, cutting open the top of my head. So she has a long history of putting her hands on me, besides the verbal abuse. She would also purposely injure herself and blame it on me.

I literally fainted on my ring cam just due to the stress of all this last month. She took the ring cam footage, made a music video out of it and sent it to the guy shes cheating with, with a caption that read ""He's crashing out"". This was also incredibly painful to see. I have developed a heart condition due to a vax injury I got in the service so I wouldnt lose my career and my ability to provide...and this is how Im rewarded for it. I've literally ruined my health and body to keep this marriage going and provide for her. She has alo refused to work our entire marriage so everything we have ever owned, I bought it.

Its been 7 years of physical and emotional abuse. She has demasculated me time and time again. Then the multiple affairs. These are just some of the things shes done. I could go on and on but I already see how much I've written. I guess I just need to vent because I've kept this trauma in the entire time and never told anyone. Her family has also cut her off over this and said her and this new guy will never be welcome for holidays or gatherings, but I Will be. Other than the grief and pain of all this, my quality of life has improved significantly since she left, and I sign papers in a few days. Her family got her to admit to abandonment and adultery on the divorce papers so it should be in my favor, and she agreed to not come after my assets.

Even after all this, I said Id forgive her and take her back. She said no. She shows no remorse or grief over anything shes done, not ONCE in 7 years have I had a sincere apology. I told her I did not want to be the one who filed for divorce because I tried to fix it, so she agreed to do it. I blame myself. I saw the red flags and still married her young and dumb. I struggled with confronting her due to my childhood trauma and let her get away with crossing these boundaries and all the disrespect and abuse. I can't blame anyone but myself. Thank you for reading and letting me vent. But...was I the Problem? Did I deserve this?",2,1757069710.0,Divorce,1,1.0,False

Daisy ran over to the crowds, bewildered at what could have started the fighting. Favian soon summoned a giant water wall to separate the warring factions. But their separation only intensified the verbal attacks against one another. However, as they got louder and louder, the veins on Favian‚Äôs forehead bulged, ready to burst.¬†*""Enough.""*Favian's demand echoed through the air, swiftly silencing the crowds.

""Your actions today have disrespected me, this army, and all the planets you swore to protect.""

A female Hu«í soldier quickly walked to Favian. ""General, of course, we respect you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen stop.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that simple.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, we‚Äôve followed your orders faithfully through so many battles. But this time it‚Äôs too much. We can't fight beside the defectors. Our current mess is the latest in a long line. We can‚Äôt forgive the Nemesis.""

A male Nemesis walked to Favian and the woman. ""They fed us lies our whole lives. How much longer do we have to repent? Or maybe there was some truth to what the emperor said.""

With the Nemesis man‚Äôs words, he reignited the conflict. The berating had resumed louder and more furiously than ever. It was as if a great fire of malice swept across everyone, incinerating reason and leaving blind hatred. But it stopped as one deafening clap traveled through the base. As both sides searched for the source, terror ran through their ranks as they saw it. Damara, as the veins bulged in her forehead.

""We face a threat mighty enough to wipe us off the galaxy, and we still bicker. I told scared children our brave men and women would protect them, and now I can hardly look them in the eye.‚Äù Daisy zoomed over to Favian, scanning the crowds. ‚ÄúWe're here because of the dream that all intelligent beings deserve to live free and happy lives. If you can't believe this dream, please leave. But for those that do, are you with me?""

Swiftly, a deathly silence washed over the base. The two sides stood in shock, seeing the fury of the gentle hero. The Nemesis man soon gave a nod to his counterpart, the Hu«í woman. As she reciprocated, their civil war was over. Daisy knew it as their malice disappeared, surveying their faces from left to right, seeing their attention pointed toward her.

""Thank you. Now, let's get to work and save Planet Aqua.""

\*\*\*

In the war room, the personnel gathered around Eugene. He worked expeditiously on his computer, decoding Anastasia‚Äôs data. The unease in the air was palpable as he inched closer to its secrets. But finally, he finished as a sea of flashing numbers appeared before them on holophone panels in midair. As he completed his task, Eugene's eyes widened, seeing the critical truth.

""Oh my god.""

*""Doc Parker, what does that mean?""*¬†Carter asked.

""The fortress does have a weakness, General Carter.""

Hastily, Eugene pressed a button on his computer, drawing everyone's attention to the middle of the room. He summoned a holographic model of darkhold. But Carter's eyes were immediately drawn to three pulsing red dots scattered across the image.

""What are those three spots?""

""They're the secret, General Carter. You see, a darkhold fortress is self-sustaining. But it can't do that without astronomical power. Those three spots are the primary generators for the doomsday device. So if you destroy them, you cripple it.""

‚ÄúBut how are we supposed to get to them?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one more thing.‚Äù

Swiftly, again, Eugene pressed a button on his computer. It made the model start shooting lasers, and slowly, Carter realized invaluable information.

""It‚Äôs an attack pattern. Like Lucas said.""

""Exactly. Its weapons have near-infinite permutations, but there's a bias toward defending those three spots, leaving areas open for attack.‚Äù

Carter squinted his eyes, looking at the model. ""But it's so narrow. Our movements will need to be flawless to have a chance.""

""Makes you wonder how that Fortis guy pulled it off,"" Yara said.

*""He pulled it off because he's the best,""*¬†Sarah shouted.

‚ÄúEverybody shut it.‚Äù Carter snapped. ‚ÄúHere's the plan. We'll break into three teams. There's no way we can get past the batteries with a fleet. So we‚Äôll make do with a small and more precise attack.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd while General Carter and I lead the assault, the rest of you evacuate. If we can't save the planet, we can save as many civilians as possible,‚Äù Favian said.

*‚ÄúSir, yes, sir,‚Äù*¬†The personnel shouted in unison.

\*\*\*

Later, the United Planets personnel were ready for their final desperate action. In the center of the base, two ships stood prepared to carry them to the great battle. But as Daisy ran over to join her comrades, her shield glowed. The light grew brighter and brighter until it blinded Daisy. However, as it dimmed, Daisy watched in disbelief as her weapon transformed into two smaller shields around her arms.

‚ÄúWhat happened to my shield?‚Äù

‚ÄúI did,‚Äù Divinus said, echoing in Daisy‚Äôs mind.

‚ÄúDivinus? Why did you do this?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have been watching you closely, Damara. You have upheld your end of our agreement. So, for the coming battle, I deemed it necessary for you to have a special gift, more of my power.‚Äù

Hearing the divinus, Daisy checked the quality of her new weapons. And she marveled at the ease of moving the shields. Now, she could defend from two directions far better than before.

‚ÄúThank you. These things will make defense way easier.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd one more thing.‚Äù

The shields caught fire into an intense blaze. But as Daisy almost jumped out of her skin, she quickly realized the flames weren‚Äôt hurting her.

‚ÄúA new power to add to your arsenal. Against those ruled by malice and evil, these flames of purity are a devastating weapon, but for others, they are a means of protection.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúUse these gifts wisely,‚Äù Divinus said in a dying whisper.

Swiftly, Daisy focused on her new powers. With a deep breath and all her concentration, she deactivated them. The flames extinguished, and her standard shield returned to her hands. And with a resolute look at her comrades, she quickly ran over. As she joined the others, Daisy giggled at an adorable sight. Carter and Clive were hugging. However, they broke away as they saw her. The two stayed far away from one another with bright red faces.

‚ÄúDamara, do you have to laugh?‚Äù Carter asked.

‚ÄúI'm sorry if I was being rude. But I just found your hug cute.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd use words like cute.‚Äù Clive pointed at Damara. ‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre just like a friend of mine, Daisy. She always says girly garbage like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that's something,‚Äù Daisy said, playfully rolling her eyes.

‚ÄúIt sure is because‚Äî‚Äù Clive spotted Ros walking into his ship and smiled. ‚Äù I'd better get ready for the mission. See you after we win, Carter.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight back at you, my friend.‚Äù

Clive dashed at top speed into the ship after Ros. Close by, Yara prepared to join the rest of her comrades inside. But as she tried to enter, Favian stopped her, looking her in the eye.

‚ÄùYara, before you go, I wanted to make something clear. Over these years, you've been an invaluable soldier and friend.‚Äù Favian took a deep breath. ‚ÄúBut desperate times call for desperate measures.""

""I understand, General Favian. And it's an honor to risk my life for the cause.""

""And one more thing. Please play nice with General Carter's friend.""

""For you, sir, I'll do my best.""

Yara gave Favian a salute, and he reciprocated. And as she finished, she hurried into the ship with the others. However, as she left, Favian saw Carter about to depart with Daisy, and he ran over to them.

""General Carter, wait.""

Daisy and Carter stopped as they heard Favian. But Carter looked at him, releasing a deep sigh.

""I realize since we've met, we've had our differences. But because of Dr. Parker, we made it this far.‚Äù Favian extended his arm to Carter for a handshake. ‚ÄúYour judgment was sound, among other decisions you made. So you deserve respect.""

As Carter saw him, disbelief swept his face. Still, it soon gave way to a small smile as he accepted the handshake.¬†

‚ÄùSame to you, hydromos. And good luck.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Daisy and Carter led their forces as they flew through the air. Carter gazed at Daisy with a confident smile. However, as the general spotted darkhold on the horizon, he looked at her again, his smile fading into a frown.

‚ÄùI hope I can keep my promise to your mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúCarter, don't talk like that. Stay focused, and I know we can make it through.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think a kiss would do me more good than words.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe're right in the open.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe're far enough away from everyone else.‚Äù

Carter went in for the kiss. Daisy tried to resist, but she relented as he pulled her in. The two‚Äôs lips got closer and closer, but as they were about to meet, Flaremane shook madly, breaking it up. Carter almost fell, but he spotted Flaremane's smug grin as he regained his balance.

*‚ÄùThe horse did that on purpose.‚Äù*¬†Carter shouted.

""Flaremane, I realize you and Carter have your differences. But we must be united to prevail.‚Äù Daisy rested her face against Flaremane's. ‚ÄúSo, can you put aside your grievances for me, especially since I love you both?""

Flaremane shook his head in agreement after a few seconds. And as Daisy saw him, she kissed his head. Conversely, Carter was prepared to berate Flaremane. However, the ringing of his communicator stopped him. And reluctantly, he answered.

""What's the matter now?""

*""We saw the steed acting erratically. Is there something wrong?""*¬†Favian asked over the communicator.

""Don't worry. Damara needed to teach it some manners.""

Suddenly, Carter heard an alarm over the communicator. Quickly, he recognized the sound, and his heart skipped a beat, realizing a terrible truth.

""The fortress is reaching full power again. And we're not close enough to dodge.""

Swiftly, the United Planets tripled their speed. The team cut through the air, but the fortress was faster. Like before, darkhold emitted dazzling purple light that bathed the battlefield for miles. And its guns launched a titanic salvo in the blink of an eye. However, as before, Daisy protected her comrades with her giant shield. They hurried into the narrow path as she deflected the plasma bolts. Daisy soon followed as the attack continued, surrounding them with certain death.

With their steely determination, the United Planets made it through the plasma bolts. But as they separated to attack their targets, Morana stepped out on a balcony and saw the assault. And as Clive's ship flew by, she shot it with her icy death beam.

*""Die, vermin,""*¬†Morana shouted.

The ship crashed into the fortress as it made contact. Carter and Daisy‚Äôs faces became pale white as they saw their comrades go down in a fiery crash.

*""Clive,""*¬†Carter screamed.",2,1757069534.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Unbeknownst to Daisy and the United Planets forces, a mechanical structure charged toward the western planets. It was a Behemoth monument of two thousand seven hundred and seventeen feet. The celestial object moved faster and faster toward the guardian barrier. With every inch it conquered, the greater the force it accumulated until it met the shield in a titanic impact. Colossal energy streams spit into space as the barrier tried to repel the object. But with astronomical force, it smashed through the defense, leaving it a crumbling mess as it continued its journey.

On planet Aqua, Eugene ran to Daisy and the others to inform Favian of the destruction of the Guardian barrier.¬†*‚ÄúGeneral Favian.‚Äú*¬†But as he attempted to alert him, a sight of terror from above stopped him cold. The entire base joined in as their rapid movement froze from seeing the object pierce through the clouds.

Powerless to stop its motion, everyone watched helplessly as the object smashed into the waters with a thunderous splash. The shock waves spread out in all directions, and in barely a second, they reached the base, shaking everything. Swiftly, the ground was torn up, buildings collapsed, and a monstrous inferno ignited from an explosion, swallowing part of the base. Daisy threw her giant shield in the inferno‚Äôs path, blocking it from claiming more lives until it subsided. But she soon witnessed a peril even her abilities couldn‚Äôt aid.¬†

A colossal title wave.

*""God help us,""*¬†Daisy said.

As Favian saw the watery doom approaching, he quickly acted. In the blink of an eye, he drew out his tiny trident, expanding it to full size. It was a conduit to aid him in focusing the mystical energies of their galaxy, Kai. Hastily he pointed the trident at the title wave, and its power sucked seas of water into him. Favian blew up like a balloon absorbing the water, but as he regained his shape, he dropped to the ground, exhausted.

Favian‚Äôs efforts bore fruit as the wave collapsed, saving the area from destruction. Daisy sighed in relief, but her heart skipped a beat as she saw multiple explosions from Palus Urbs. The shockwaves ruptured fuel containers and caused other damage that ignited the infernos. Visions of the critically ill and the children screaming in agony plagued her mind like vengeful phantasms, berating her failure as she saw the brilliant green and blue flames.

Not wasting a second, Daisy summoned Flaremane. ""I'm going to Palus Urbs. I'll be back when I can.""

*""No chance, you're staying here,""*¬†Carter commanded.

""What? I can't just leave people to d‚Äî.‚Äù Daisy looked towards the horizon, trembling. ‚ÄúHeaven help us.""

As the mist from the object's impact cleared, Daisy learned why Carter ordered her to stay. For its form was revealed to the terror of her and her comrades. It was a Darkhold Fortress in all its great and terrible power.

""Of course, a Darkhold Fortress is the one thing that should have enough power to break through my guardian barrier,"" Eugene said.

""But how can this be? After the destruction of the Earth fortress, they shouldn't have the resources to build another one so soon,"" Daisy said.

""I-it must have been Dr. Zola.‚Äù Eugene gripped his forehead. ‚ÄúHe found some way to optimize their production.""

""I don't believe it.""

Favian limped to the group with Yara's help. ""Believe it. Zola's a sick man, but he's also one of the most brilliant scientists in the galaxy. But that begs the question, why are we all still alive?""

For answers, everyone turned their fearful gaze onto Eugene. His heart halted for a second as he saw them, vigorously rubbing his head to formulate a solution.

""W-well, if I had to guess, I think it was the guardian barrier. Breaking through it must have taken a considerable amount of power. So they'll need a little time to recharge.‚Äù Eugene swallowed hard. ‚ÄúThen we're ash.""

""Doc Parker, how long is a little time?"" Carter asked.

""I don't know. Maybe a day, hours, minutes.""

Carter turned his gaze to Favian. ""I don't like it, but heavy casualties or not, we can't give this part of space up without a fight.""

Carter's words cut Favian like a knife. But he swiftly gave him a nod.""Yara, I'm too weak to lead our forces. So General Carter gets full command. Make sure everyone gets the message.""

""Yes, sir.""

""Thanks, Hydromos. Yara and Clive start rounding up every single living pilot we have. We're launching a full-force airstrike.""

The base soon went into red alert. Alarms filled the air, and the personnel hurried, preparing for the assault. Racing against time, they worked on the aircraft, readying them for battle. Hastily, numerous squadrons of pilots entered them, and as the personnel finished their preparations, one after another took flight. As they soared, a colossal sonic boom reverberated through the air. Signaling their readiness for combat as Daisy flew ahead with steely-eyed determination, leading the force to a dire battle.

\*\*\*

The United Planets squadrons approached their target, Darkhold. And on a balcony, Cymbeline gazed at his enemies with hellish fire covering his eyes. He saw the approaching ships, and his vision tinted crimson, growing into an intense blaze.

He had proudly subjugated many planets for his lord and master, Mavor. But this mission was personal. The flames in his eyes gave way to an image of the past long ago on planet Nemesis. Like the present, Cymbeline watched as an aerial battle loomed upon him. However, as a young child, solitary in a sea of people running for their lives. It was fighters from what was now the Western United Planets. The Nemesis had the misfortune of their world being a valuable strategic location. Paramilitaries continued to fight, attempting to conquer Nemesis to secure military superiority even after the first galactic war had concluded.

Three centuries later, Cymbeline could still remember them unleashing waves of artillery to destroy their enemies. The stray shots rained down upon them, bathing their land in a great fire. And the blaze, claiming the lives of hundreds and leaving smoldering bodies before his young, crying eyes.

""The time has come to avenge our fathers and mothers. We will set fire to their land just as they did ours. Now, in the name of our great emperor, attack my legion. Leave no survivors,"" Cymbeline spat.

Cymbeline's forces quickly responded to his orders. Squadrons of Nemesis ships double the size of their enemy flew off from the fortress. They swiftly cut through the air to meet their opponents. As the two armies met, mayhem ensued as ships broke formation, flying wildly across the sky.

The two armies were relentless in the dogfight, blasting away at each other. The United Planets shot down one enemy after another, but the Nemesis quickly gained control of the battle with Zola‚Äôs superior aircraft technology and numbers. They cut across the sky, shooting down their enemy and leaving blazing destruction across their forces.

Daisy soon turned the tide again as she threw her giant shield at the Nemesis, butchering the enemy ships. Still, debris from their destruction found its way into Daisy‚Äôs eyes, blinding her. As she cleaned her eyes, she could feel Flaremane panicking, hearing his terrified nays. ‚ÄùSteady, boy.‚Äù Bewildered at his behavior, she held his reins tight, forcing him to stay still as she cleansed her eyes. But she learned why he was afraid as her vision returned. A squadron of Nemesis ships fired their plasma guns at her at nearly point-blank range.

1n91wtl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n91wtl,JAVAPEN Metal Grip,"* **MODEL:**

JAVAPEN Metal Grip  
0.5 mm *(only available in 0.5 mm)*¬†¬†¬†¬†

* **MATERIALS:**

As the name implies, you get a metal grip and also a metal cone tip and pocket clip, with a plastic body and lead hardness selector ring. Moreover, you also have a few metal rings throughout the body for decoration. Internally it has a full-brass clutch, but the rest is plastic.

* **ERASER:**

JAVAPEN used a system very similar to what Tombow and specially, Faber-Castell ([TK-Fine](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1l40763/fabercastell_tkfine_vario/)) uses, with the same way to access the eraser - twist the top part to extend the eraser. Impressively, the Metal Grip comes with a 34 mm-long white latex eraser. However, the rubber they use doesn‚Äôt feel as soft as Tombow‚Äôs.

* **MEASUREMENTS:**

The Metal Grip measures 145 mm from tip to cap, with a body diameter of 9.3 mm. The grip, on its most Northern part, has 9.3 mm, but that comes down to 8.2 mm close to the tip. Weighing it on my coffee scale I got 17.48 g, and it has a forward balance, with the center of mass located 58 mm from the tip.

* **FEATURES:**

Other than the metal grip and extendable eraser, this is a basic mechpen. You do get a lead hardness indicator, though, consisting of a ring right above the grip that you twist to display 2B, B, HB, F, H, 2H or 4H. If you ask me, the way they implemented the lead hardness display looks suspiciously similar to what you see on Platinum‚Äôs Pro-Use [MSD-500](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1mmjms5/platinum_prouse_msd500/)‚Ä¶ ü§î

* **AESTHETICS:**

In my eyes this one could have been a true looker, but alas, it falls short. The combination of the bright blue plastic body with writing on the full extension, and worse of all, the too shiny metal parts, make it look cheap. A more subdued body color or tone and matte metal parts would turn it into something awesome. JAVAPEN offers it also in white, black and pink, and to me the white version is the best looking one.

* **ERGONOMICS:**

*Almost* good. I say that because the pocket clip is long enough to dig into my hand, when I rotate the pencil around. Furthermore, it has kind of sharp edges, so it becomes an issue. The grip, though *almost* having good dimensions, is also too coarse. Not a cheese-grater, but definitively not [R600](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/comments/1lfcplr/rotring_600/)\-smooth. With all that I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs bad, but for prolonged use it got uncomfortable.

* **MY THOUGHTS:**

JAVAPEN is a Korean brand, founded in 1997. They produce a lot of stationary products, and some mechpens. The Metal Grip is their flagship model, and according to their website, it is produced in Korea but with ‚ÄúJapanese R&D‚Äù. If you want to see their full line, look at their catalogue [here](https://online.fliphtml5.com/ezaol/rhpx/).

I didn‚Äôt know what to expect from the Metal Grip, since JAVAPEN, at least to me, is a very obscure brand. The impression that I now have is that it is something more budget-orientated. And no, there‚Äôs nothing bad about that. It has some very nice characteristics, that could have been better implemented, but nothing truly demeaning. Well, I guess that comes with being a budget mode... Even so, in the end I think it‚Äôs a very decent mechpen, and something I would recommend depending on the situation. Of all the mechpens that I have, I think the Metal Grip is in the middle tier, so not bad.",7,1757069258.0,mechanicalpencils,0,1.0,False
1n91wkc,https://v.redd.it/n2lbcfx3rbnf1,My VTOL-VR-Like Helicopter game is coming to Steam !,"[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3982130/Hijong\_Parks\_Defender\_Patrol/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3982130/Hijong_Parks_Defender_Patrol/)

  
I was planning to trash this game on [Itch.io](http://Itch.io) and focus on the sequel, but the false virus flagging and lack of sophisticated quick launch menu from virtual desktop made me to switch the plan.

  
But I think the game is not good enough to justify the hard earned money, So I divided the game to 'Standard Edition' and 'Supporter edition'.

'Standard Edition' will be free to download and it will already have most of the contents to enjoy.

'Supporter Edition', priced at 4.99 dollars, will be a 'Buy me a coffee' option that allows you to fly politically distinct AH-6 Little bird and gain access to steam achievements.

  
I also wrote a pinned thread of FAQ and future plans at the steam discussion.

  
I tried to port this game to Standalone VR but failed due to skill issue. This game is planned to be released in late October and there are still several weeks left, so I'll try it again soon.

  
Right after launching this game I'll focus on making the bigger sequel for years, to make something that actually worth the money like VTOL VR !",84,1757069233.0,vtolvr,17,0.96,False

1n91v2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1n91v2a/how_chuck_lost_his_half_of_a_house/,How Chuck lost his half of a house.,"Back in the late nineties a buddy of mine, Dan, rented a place from one of our old high-school classmates, Chuck. He'd inherited it from his grandmother and, well, had no interest in living there.

The place was dated. Pink bathrooms, 'Harvest Puke' appliances, lots of dark wood paneling, and a 'conversation pit' in the 'rumpus room'... But Chuck had agreed to rent the place for only $600/month, which made it a total steal. My one bedroom apartment was $425, and this was a 2/2 with a garage and an acre of back yard.

It became the unofficial hang-out spot for five or six months before Dan swapped to night shift.

Then one day Dan calls me at 6am and asks me if I have the home number for a plumber we know socially. 

>Dan: I've been having trouble with things draining and Chuck has been telling me he'll send someone, but now I've got an inch of sewage in the basement, it can't wait, and his answering service isn't picking up.

I pass the number along and I don't hear any more about it. I still see Dan out and about a couple nights a week, he just doesn't mention it and I figure it got handled.

But who does bring it up? Chuck. The first time I see him in months he dashes his ass across the park to catch up with me and bitches about how Dan screwed him by calling the plumber and letting the guy point out a whole bunch of code violations he's gotta fix.

Except, apparently, Chuck doesn't actually fix any of them. No, what he does is pretend he's not getting rent from Dan, and files for eviction. 

Once again, I hear that bit first not from Dan, but from Chuck, who saw me walk in to the grocery store and left his place in line to come gossip about how Dan is going to be homeless and broke really soon for screwing with him.

I'm not real sure on what Chuck's telling me, what with the fact that I know from experience that code violations aren't something you can elect to not fix, but there are lots of wormy methods for landlords to fuck their tenants, including pretending that rent didn't arrive, so..

That evening I go out of my way to see Dan. I wouldn't have normally gone to the bar on a Tuesday, or any hockey night at all, but I knew he'd be there and I wanted to warn him.

Except nothing I say regarding Chuck or eviction is a surprise. He's smirking for most of it, and chuckling towards the end.

>Dan: Don't worry, dude. I have a pretty good lawyer, and that's all I'm gonna say.

>Me: But....

>Dan: Shaddup already, the Wings game is starting.

A couple of months go by, Dan is back on day shift, and his place has become the unofficial hangout again. It's a bitter cold Saturday in January, so four or five of us are in the 'rumpus room' playing video games when we see Chuck's sister, Elle, wander up to the sliding doors with some paperwork and knock.

Off goes the Mega Deth. We all want to hear what this is about.

>Elle: nosu de mausnai egle da..

I can't really hear her, it's just near-whispered gibberish from where I am. She's always been soft-spoken, and seems to be especially so today. But I can hear Dan just fine.

>Dan: Really? That's good. Which one do I have to sign, wait, this one? And do you have a..

>Elle, producing a pen and pointing: .......

Dan scribbles.

>Dan: And the eviction?

>Elle, shuffling papers and handing Dan some: .......

>Dan: Fantastic. Why don't you come in and have some coffee? We're playing Quake, if you want to join us.

>Elle: .......

>Dan: Yeah, I understand. 

Dan boops her nose, complete with a 'honk'. Elle laughs and walks out towards the driveway.

I didn't know what to say, especially with that.. Whatever it was, with the nose.

>Dan: So, I'm sure all you have heard that Chuck tried to evict me. Chuck lost, had to pay me more than his half of the house was worth to make me go away, and, uh, Elle is my new landlord.

Murmurs.

>Dan: But she had to get a mortgage to buy him out, so if anyone wants to rent a room, let me know, because I'm sure what I'm paying is about to go up.",42,1757069096.0,pettyrevenge,3,0.87,False

1n91umx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1n91umx/career_path_after_a_finance_internship/,Career path after a Finance Internship.,"Hia,

So a year ago I've graduated with a BS in Finance & Accountancy, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Banking and Risk Management.

Right now I'm doing a 6 month internship in Finance at a Private investment bank (Wall-street, billions AUM, unnecessarily expensive coffee machines) and I'm doing so in Europe, more specifically Poland.

I've just gotten an offer to stay with them for 6 more months as an intern, which would total 12 months.

My official role is ""fund accounting/reporting"", doing mostly Real Estate and Private Equity - GL accounting, Consolidations, Controlling all that jazz.

Here‚Äôs the situation: in 12 months, I‚Äôll be permanently moving to the U.S. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how my background (EU degrees + 1 year of fund accounting) will compare against U.S. grads who usually have local degrees and a few summer internships.

I feel like a year of accounting could set me up well for FP&A or corporate finance, but I‚Äôd ideally like to pursue Private Equity further since I‚Äôve gotten decent exposure to it here, is it possible?

In June I had booked a 9 day holiday from which was approved months in advance, upon returning to work from the holiday, I had undergone contractual changes to facilitate childcare needs, dropping from 5 days a week to 3 days a week, still working the same amount of hours just over a shorter period. These changes were implemented from the 13th of July. The time in which my holiday fell meant I was expecting to receive the holiday pay as part of July‚Äôs payday, only to find I hadn‚Äôt been paid for it. I contacted the administrative team who told me that because of the contractual changes, my holiday entitlement had changed, despite the change being implemented almost two weeks after I had been on said holiday. 
The companies resolution to my issue is to add 4 days worth of holiday pay on my next payslip, while simultaneously docking me of those 4 days from my remaining entitlement, as they say holiday entitlement is accrued over a days per week basis as opposed to hours. They‚Äôre now pressuring me to make a decision regarding adding the holiday pay to my next pay or to keep the remaining 4 days.
Does anyone have any advice? Do I have wiggle room to push back? Or is this a misunderstanding on my part and I should comply with what I‚Äôm being told?

Hey everyone! Have you noticed? We‚Äôre living smack dab in the middle of one of the coolest (and honestly, most mind-blowing) technological shifts ever. AI automation isn‚Äôt just some far-off sci-fi idea anymore‚Äînope, it‚Äôs here, it‚Äôs happening, and it‚Äôs making magic.

Have you asked ChatGPT for dinner ideas? Watched YouTube‚Äôs recommendations actually nail your favorite genre? Or seen how some businesses have chatbots running 24/7 customer support better than humans ever could?

That‚Äôs AI automation at work. And wow‚Ä¶ the possibilities just keep expanding!

What‚Äôs SO Exciting About It?
- Tedious tasks? Bye-bye!
- Instant data analysis, customer support, scheduling, copywriting, and way more? All possible!
- Smart systems learn on their own and just keep getting sharper.

Picture this: Imagine a world where you wake up and your virtual assistant has already sorted your emails, prepped your calendar, recommended your breakfast (with nutrition info!), and even notified you about traffic delays‚Äîbefore you‚Äôve even finished your coffee.

We‚Äôre seeing:
- Businesses using AI-driven automation to streamline hiring, making the process faster and fairer.
- Creative folks generating awe-inspiring art, music, and stories with a few prompts!
- Solo developers building entire apps and launching businesses in days‚Äînot months.

But wait, there‚Äôs more! ü•≥

AI automation opens the doors for:
- More time for creative thinking, problem-solving, and‚Ä¶ well, actually living your life instead of being bogged down by ‚Äúbusy work.‚Äù
- Empowering people with physical or cognitive disabilities to tackle jobs, interact online, and access tools that might have been impossible before.
- Supercharging innovation as more of us get to play and build with these AI-powered tools.

Does Anyone Else Feel Giddy?
I catch myself grinning just thinking about it. Each week brings a shiny new update‚Äîbetter AI models, smarter workflows, more accessible platforms‚Äîand it genuinely makes me geek out. The efficiency boosts! The creative madness! The wild, unpredictable results when you mashup an idea with a smart algorithm!

Of course, automation with AI brings BIG questions, too:
- What will the workplace look like in a few years?
- Where will we, as humans, put our energy, our creativity?
- How can we ensure it‚Äôs safe and fair for everyone?

Let‚Äôs Dream Together üöÄ

Imagine it: collaborating with AI that ‚Äúgets‚Äù you, freeing your days for bigger dreams and wilder adventures‚Äîwhile the bots crunch the boring bits. Does AI automation excite you? Where do you see it taking your work, your hobbies, or your life?

Let‚Äôs chat!
- What‚Äôs your go-to AI automation tool?
- What‚Äôs a magic moment you‚Äôve experienced using it?
- Any hopes or worries bubbling up as things speed ahead?

Drop your thoughts! I honestly can‚Äôt wait to swap ideas and maybe share a few ‚Äúwow, did that just happen?‚Äù stories. üòÅ

1n91jbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1n91jbn/about_right_livelihood/,About right livelihood,"Hello everybody,

I have a dream of having my own coffee shop/bar. I truly believe that places like this make people happy (I've been doing this for a while now) and it has given me the opportunity to meet different people, have deep conversations, and make people smile.

The problem is: Selling alcohol can cause harm to people. It never occurred to me because I'm a very moderate drinker. But I really wouldn't want to be the reason for someone's alcoholism.

But I love doing what I do, I love mixology, I love making drinks, and I've been able to make many people happy through my work.

What do you think about this?

Thanks!",1,1757067986.0,Buddhism,7,1.0,False
