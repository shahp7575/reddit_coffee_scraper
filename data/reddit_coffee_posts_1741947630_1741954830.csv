But I don't want to eat bread anymore.

Any suggestions on what I could replace my breakfast with? I also don't have time to be able to cook in the mornings. I'm definitely open to preparing something the night before. I can't do anything acidic like fruit, it makes my stomach even worse. Peanut butter is really what I'm eating the bread is just the vessel.

1jb26zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1jb26zh/paris_restaurant_tips_update_from_last_year/,Paris restaurant tips (update from last year),"As the spring/summer travel season approaches, I'm (re)posting and updated version of some Paris restaurant tips. \[mods: I won't post this again, but this is a significant update from last year's post.\]

I'm an American who has lived in Paris for several years and I've been a frequent tourist starting way back in '89k. I'm sure you already know that tipping is not expected (leaving a few euro is nice, certainly not required) and French folks generally don‚Äôt tip at all. You know that ‚Äúentree‚Äù means a starter rather than a main course (which is a ‚Äúplat). But there‚Äôs a few other things that are useful to know and I‚Äôve compiled a list of my top 10 restaurant tips for France/Paris. Actually top 9 as you‚Äôll see if you read the whole post.

**1. Carafe d'eau**

Get a free bottle of tap water instead of paying ‚Ç¨6+ for bottled water. This usually only works for still water, so if you want sparkling water you'll be paying for it. If the server asks ""still or sparkling,"" you can say ""une carafe"" to get free tap water. If you say ""still"" you might get 8‚Ç¨ bottled water. Saying ‚Äútap water‚Äù also probably works, but it's better to start your interaction with a little bit of French.

**2. Bread**

Bread will come in a basket. You won't get an individual bread plate, except at fancy restaurants. You simply rest your piece on the table or on your plate. And one main purpose for bread is soaking up the sauce left after you've eaten the dish. You should do this! I guess unless you're in a fancy restaurant, but even then I can't resist. And bread is included with your meal‚Ä¶there is no extra charge.

**3. Pay when you like**

First time visitors from the US (and other places, I'm sure) often get frustrated with the pace of French service, especially concerning the bill. This is not bad service, in fact the French excel at restaurant service (outside of very touristy spots). Being a restaurant server is a proper profession for many, not just a temporary gig.

At a proper restaurant, the French usually won't bring you the bill until you ask. So just ask your server. But let's you're ready to leave but you can't find the server bill. Don't worry...just stand up and leave, being sure to stop by the payment station on your way out. Don't do this at a Michelin \* place (or anywhere that has particularly attentive service), but at almost all restaurants this is normal. Especially at lunch.¬†¬†

It's not considered rude. Nobody will think you're trying to leave without paying. I felt awkward the first time I did this. Now it feels like a superpower.¬†

**4. Split the bill**

Furthermore, each person can pay for what they had. Splitting the bill evenly is easiest, of course, and this is completely normal in Paris. But if there are significant differences per person (e.g. some had wine, others didn't), just figure out what each should pay and then pay the server one at a time. The last person pays whatever remains. Some restaurants have POS systems that allow the server to click individual items for each person, which is super convenient. But most do not. No problem, you can do the math yourself. Again, completely normal.

**5. Pi√®ce de Boucher**

‚ÄúThe butcher's piece,‚Äù in English. It's a good thing to order, but let's start with some basics about beef.¬†

Beef in France is a bit different from US beef. Almost all beef in France is grass fed, whereas the US still favors the fattier corn-fed (or corn-finished) version. The taste is different‚Ä¶both are great, but you need to adjust your expectations. An American coming to France should order their beef one level less cooked than in the US because the beef is less fatty in France. Otherwise it will be dry. So if you prefer medium rare, order rare. Medium becomes medium rare. If you like medium-well or well-done‚Ä¶please order chicken or pasta. Seriously.¬†

Onto *la piece de boucher*‚Ä¶the butcher's piece, in other words, the cut that the butcher keeps for himself. You should order it. This could be flank steak or hanger steak or skirt steak or something like that (French names included hampe, bavette, onglet, and more). It won't be the prettiest cut, but it will be packed with beefy goodness.¬†

>Avez-vous choisi ?¬†

>*Oui, je prends la piece de boucher.*

>Quelle cuisson ?¬†

>*Saignant, svp.*¬†

Thank me later.

(thanks to musicalastronaut for suggesting this)

**6. Meal time**

Dinner is at 8 or 9. Ap√©ro at 6 or 7. In Paris, people often end their work day at 7pm, so you won't see many French people eating dinner at 6. The atmosphere will usually be more lively if you go at 8:30 or later. You can eat earlier, but you may be alone at the restaurant with a few other tourists.

The same applies to lunch, with the most common hours being 12:30 - 2:00. The doors may open at noon but you may find yourself alone. After 2:30 or 3:00 you may find the restaurant closed or, perhaps open but with the kitchen closed (see ‚Äúservice continu‚Äù below).¬†

**7. Service Continu**

In France, like most places in the world,¬† restaurants may close or offer a limited menu between lunch and dinner. If you're hungry between 2:30pm and 7pm you're going to find a lot of places closed. But there are many brasseries with ‚Äúservice continu.‚Äù Do I need to translate? I didn't think so.¬†

It's hard to search for these on the internet, though. If you use the Google maps ‚Äúopen now‚Äù filter, it will show you places that are open but, in fact, may not be serving their full menu. So look for signs that say ‚Äúservice continu.‚Äù You can be sure the full menu is available.

(thanks to Maleficent-Lime1665 for suggesting this)

**6. Cafe gourmand**

Order a cafe gourmand and you'll receive 3-5 mini desserts and a coffee, basically for the price of a single dessert. It's usually enough to share as well, making it an even better deal. One person orders a cafe gourmand, the other just a cafe, and you both get enough dessert! (unless you're still really hungry after entree, plat, et fromage üòÇ)

Note that these are premade desserts and likely not the best the restaurant will have to offer. For that reason, I rarely take this at dinner, but I will share one at lunch.

**9. Pichet du vin.**¬†

If you're not a wine snob like I am, or if you‚Äôre in the mood for something casual and fun, you can order a pichet du vin. It's less expensive wine in a pitcher instead of a bottle. Perfectly drinkable, in most cases. If you do this at lunch in a small village in a wine-producing region you might think you've died and gone to heaven‚Ä¶the wine is so good and so inexpensive. That will be the time on your holiday you start to dream of buying that farmhouse to renovate. You imagine living the simple life in the French countryside, making artisanal cheeses, and speaking fluently with a charming accent‚Ä¶but I digress!

You'll likely get 500ml. Sometimes the restaurant will just bring a liter bottle and charge you based on how much remains. This is called ‚Äúvin √† la ficelle‚Äù (wine by the string, where a string traditionally was used to measure how much was consumed). This is delightful but dangerous. You have been warned!

(thanks to SesameFoil for suggesting this)

**10. Flower cafes.**¬†

\[I've added this one so I could have 10 items on my list.\]

Don't go to flower cafes. Please. Just‚Ä¶don't. Maybe the first couple of these were cute a decade ago. But it's been overdone for years now. It's not clever, is not special, and they aren't real flowers. It has jumped the shark. Please help us rid the city of these by taking your business elsewhere.¬†",6,1741953493.0,ParisTravelGuide,3,1.0,False
1jb25xd,https://i.redd.it/obow7fvr9noe1.jpeg,Passed below is my experience,"In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
All praise is due to Allah, first and last, outwardly and inwardly, for His guidance and great blessings. Thanks belong to Him alone for allowing me to reach this point today.
I extend my deepest gratitude and appreciation to my dear father and my beloved mother who have been my strongest support system from the very beginning. I also thank my dear siblings for their continuous support throughout this journey until this success.
I must also acknowledge my fellow doctors who were part of this journey and provided me with both psychological and academic support and everyone who taught me a single letter and contributed to my academic growth. For whoever does not thank people does not thank Allah.
My Journey in Preparing for the USMLE Step 1
Preparation Duration:
6 months
Study Resources:
First Aid 2024: The primary study resource; the exam is entirely based on its concepts.
B&B Videos: Did not add much value for me, so I recommend starting directly with First Aid.
Dirty Medicine for Ethics and Biochemistry: Highly recommended.
Sketchy Micro and Pharma: Great for those with a visual memory.
Randy Neil for Biostatistics: Highly recommended.
Mehlmann Random Videos: Strongly recommended, as they immerse you in the exam environment from the beginning.
UWorld (The Most Important Question Bank):
I started by solving 20 questions daily while reviewing First Aid, then gradually increased to 80 questions daily after completing my first pass of First Aid.
B&B Start Date: 22/10/2024
First Aid Start Date: 26/10/2024
UWorld Start Date: 3/1/2025
Intensive Review Period (Dedicated Period):
Began after completing First Aid and included:
Reviewing Mehlmann‚Äôs PDFs (Biochemistry, Immunology, Ethics, Biostats, Neurosurgery, Muscles, Arrows).
Using Amboss Ethics (Highly recommended).
Reviewing First Aid again (though I didn‚Äôt finish it).
Assessments:
NBME 24 (3/1/2025): 58% (Used it to practice time management rather than aiming for a high score).
NBME 25 (6/1/2025): 61% (Started feeling anxious, so I focused on my weak areas).
NBME 26 (12/1/2025): 70%
NBME 27 (19/1/2025): 68% (These two scores reassured me since Mehlmann recommends having two consecutive NBME scores above 65% to ensure passing).
NBME 28 (26/1/2025): 71%
NBME 29 (2/2/2025): 70%
NBME 30 (7/2/2025): 70%
Old Free 120 Offline (12/2/2025): 71%
NBME 31 (15/2/2025): 73% (9 days before the exam).
New Free 120 Online (20/2/2025): 66% (4 days before the exam, and it was the closest to the actual test format).
3 Days Before the Exam:
Reviewed NBME 1-31 images.
Day Before the Exam:
I tried to stop studying but couldn‚Äôt, so I read until noon, then completely stopped due to exhaustion. I spent the rest of the day relaxing, walking, and exercising to reduce stress. I went to bed early after preparing my exam essentials.
I planned to take a 10-minute break after every two blocks, based on advice from colleagues who had already taken the test.
Exam Day (24/2/2025):
I had breakfast and coffee, then headed to the testing center early. I felt confident that I had done my absolute best and entrusted my success to Allah.
Test Session Breakdown:
Block 1 & 2: Took them together, followed by a 10-minute coffee break.
Block 3 & 4: Attempted them together but big mistake‚ÄîI felt exhausted during Block 4.
10-minute break with a protein bar and coffee before Block 5.
Block 5 & 6: Repeated the same mistake and took them together, making Block 6 extremely tiring.
Long meal break before the final block, which ended up being my best-performing block.
Exam Observations:
The exam is not difficult but requires intense focus.
The questions are very long, some reaching 30 lines without answer choices! Others were medium-length or short, but the format was similar to the New Free 120.
The entire exam is based on First Aid concepts, so repeated revision is key to success.
Final Words:
This is the hardest exam you may face in your life, but with dedication and perseverance, you can overcome it.
Lastly, I sincerely thank the Reddit community and Kira Pota community, as they played a significant role in sharing experiences and learning from others.
All praise is due to Allah for this achievement. May He grant success to everyone!",5,1741953390.0,step1,2,1.0,False

It was early when I woke up startled. The house was completely silent, except for a low buzz that came from the room. I got up with my heart beating in my ears and walked cautiously, trying to locate the origin of the sound.



There it was. My grandfather's old radio, an outdated device that we never used, on at the room table. The static sulked in the air until, suddenly, a voice emerged between the white noise.



It was my voice.



I was frozen. I was listening to something that was strangely familiar to me. At first I thought it was a coincidence, but when I paid more attention, I recognized the conversation: it was a talk that I had with my sister that morning, word for word. On the movie we had seen, about the coffee we drink. But then, something changed.



My voice was distorted, lengthened and became more serious. My sister's voice also changed, as if someone else was repeating her words, imitating her tone, but in an incorrect, almost mocking way.



""Don't let me find you,"" said her voice ... but I was sure that in our real conversation, she had never said that.



I turned off the radio of a blow and moved away, with bristly skin. Maybe I was too tired, maybe my mind was playing a bad pass. But the feeling of discomfort did not disappear.



The next day, I tried to forget it, convinced that it was a device failure. But that night, the radio was turned on again.



This time, the voice that came out of the speakers was not mine. It was my mother's.



My mother had died two years ago.



My hands trembled when listening to her. It was a conversation that we had when I was a child. We talked about my fear of darkness, about the shadows I saw in my room. But then, the conversation took a turn that had never occurred in real life.



""You're not alone,"" said his voice. ""You've never been alone.""



I ran to unplug the radio, but when I pulled the cable, I realized something impossible: the plug was not connected. The radio had been working without any energy source.



Terror paralyzed me. I knew I had to get rid of that device. I took it to the backyard and destroyed it with a hammer until there was only a lot of twisted metal and broken glass. I breathed relieved, convinced that I had ended that nightmare.



But when I entered the house, an indescribable cold toured my back.



From the room, at the same table where the radio had been, a soft static began to sound.



And then, among the crackling of white noise, a voice whispered my name.",1,1741953351.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Are there any supplements I should stay away from? Any medications I should add to help with the hypotension and heart rate?

- (1/3 serving) Creatine (1000mcg)
- (1 serving) rhodiola extract (386mcg)
- (1 serving) boron citrate (100mcg)

I take my Vyvanse first thing in the morning, eat a light breakfast and take my supplements about 1 hour after my Vyvanse. I usually drink 2 cups of coffee which comes to around 200mg of caffeine.

And then I won't list what I ate right now but what I ate for dinner today equates about to 700 calories. So 700 calories for lunch today(I skipped breakfast)and then 800 calories for dinner. So that's 1400 calories in one day. I'm 17, 5'6 and I'm 49kg and my BMR is 2500 calories so I'm not sure if I'm eating too less or too much. I decided to brave through the hunger and eat this less because I found out that if I eat even a bit too much than 1400 calories I maintain weight so I try to eat less than that if I can. I have done that many times already and I binge eat whenever that happens and I gain weight but now I'm trying to fight through the hunger but I'm not sure if it's from the coffee that I drank too much of that I'm having a headache or if I'm just hungry.

It was ok and sweet while it lasted but we were more compatible as friends and we got bored and he also ended up talking to his exes in the last week i think so we stopped talking (we didn't fight, were on neutral therms). 

I don't understand how so many of my friends have boys all over them all the time. One of my friends is very attractive and a social butterfly (and she also has lilith in scorpio) she has a really strong sexual energy (i even feel it and im straigh i think) and she ALWAYS talks to one or more boys at a time. Literally even if we stay in a coffee shop people ask for her ig out of nowhere.

Also some friends have serious relationships and started their sex life and I didn't even get my first kiss.

It's weird because I also have lilith in scorpio but I don't attract boys at all generally only sometimes when im at bars at night and weird men in their 20s flirt with me. I only get attention from weird older men and my friends only dated very attractive boys.

Honestly I AM happy for my friends(the ones with healthy relationships) but i can t help but wonder if there s something wrong with me? Idk i never cared about having a relationship but now as i start listening to them about their sex life and dating and stuff i can t help but wonder IF ILL EVER TALK TO SOMEONE? And why I haven't by now. 

I am also pretty and a good person with a good personality and intelligent but I don't get any of that. The diffrence is that i am an introvert and it's kinda hard for me to talk to people without knowing them at all because i have to trust them first. 

My sister says it's because i have a lot of feminine energy and i seem innocent or childish and boys would feel like pedophiles if they talked to me. And also because i may have a closed off energy with strangers but it's not on purpose.

Anyways... i tried reading my astrology and i don't really know how so if someone could tell me if ill ever have a relationship or why is this happening or if it's a karmic lesson to build up character feel free to commentüòá bc idk how to read this accurately.

Mr. Forsaken is a highly skilled practitioner of ‚ÄúPhysically In, Mentally Out‚Äù survival techniques, specializing in stealth tactics, financial optimization, and strategic resistance against forced religious participation. With years of experience navigating INC services under parental pressure, they have perfected the art of appearing devout while maximizing personal gain.

When not dodging offerings or smuggling snacks, I enjoy:
üèÄ Watching NBA highlights (even during sermons!)
üìö Studying for exams inside church services
üí∞ Secretly saving the ‚Ç±50 offering money
üç¨ Upgrading snacks for peak stealth enjoyment

Disclaimer: This guide is for entertainment and survival purposes only. If you get caught, execute ‚ÄúThe Holy Head Nod‚Äù and deny everything.

A PIMO Masterclass in Physically In, Mentally Out

**Introduction**

Forced to attend INC services but don‚Äôt actually believe in it? No worries‚Äîyou can turn these sessions into productive (or entertaining) experiences while keeping up appearances. This guide will teach you how to survive, thrive, and even profit while sitting through worship services.

**Chapter 1: The Art of Giving‚Ä¶ Nothing**

INC will pressure you to give offerings, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to. Here‚Äôs how to master the art of seeming obedient while keeping your money.

‚úÖ The Air Drop Technique ‚Äì Pretend to drop something in the bag, but really, it‚Äôs just air. Smooth and undetectable.
‚úÖ The Ghost Coin Move ‚Äì Hold an imaginary coin, make a small flicking motion, and let it ‚Äúfall.‚Äù Nobody will question you.
‚úÖ The Fake Fold ‚Äì Take the ‚Ç±50 your parents gave you, fold it, keep it in your hand but don‚Äôt drop it, and slip it back into your pocket.
‚úÖ The Minimalist Move ‚Äì If you ever must give, just drop a single centavo to avoid suspicion.

Bonus Tip: Collect ‚Ç±50 every service, and in a month, you‚Äôll have extra snack or savings money. Turning forced worship into financial gain? Elite move.

**Chapter 2: The Snack Smuggling Blueprint**

Services are long and boring, so why not enjoy a good snack while you‚Äôre there? Here‚Äôs how to bring food without getting caught.

ü•á Best Snacks for Stealth Mode:
- Mints & Candy (Maxx, Snowbear, Halls) ‚Äì Disguised as a ‚Äúcough remedy.‚Äù
- Soft Bread or Pandesal ‚Äì No crunch, no mess.
- Chocolate (Flat Tops, Nips, etc.) ‚Äì Silent and satisfying.
- Gummy Bears or Marshmallows ‚Äì Easy to chew, no noise.
- Dried Mangoes or Banana Chips ‚Äì Looks semi-respectable if caught.

 Advanced Move: The Beverage Hack
- Bring a tumbler of iced coffee, milk tea, or juice and place it in your bag. Sip discreetly during long, drawn-out parts of the sermon.

Pro Tip: If anyone asks, say you have low blood sugar and need a quick snack. No one questions ‚Äúmedical‚Äù reasons.

**Chapter 3: The Ultimate Phone Tactics**

Since you‚Äôre already forced to sit there, might as well maximize your time. Your phone is your best weapon for survival.

 üéì Study Mode (When Exams Are Near)
- Download PDFs, lecture slides, or Anki flashcards beforehand.
- Place your phone between your thighs so it‚Äôs hidden but easy to access.
- If someone glances over, keep a Bible app open as a decoy.

üì∫ Entertainment Mode (No Exams? No Problem!)
    - Pre-download NBA highlights ‚Äì Watch full games or classic moments.
    - Netflix Offline Mode ‚Äì Download movies or series for later.
    - YouTube Playlists ‚Äì Watch podcasts, gaming content, or random conspiracy theories.
    - E-Books & Articles ‚Äì If you want to look ‚Äúintellectual,‚Äù read a book on your phone and pretend to take notes.

**Chapter 4: Mastering the ‚ÄúHoly Head Nod‚Äù**

To avoid suspicion, you must look like you‚Äôre paying attention‚Äîeven when you‚Äôre not.

‚úÖ The Slow Nod of Agreement ‚Äì When the minister raises his voice, nod slightly as if the ‚Äúmessage hit you deep.‚Äù
‚úÖ The Deep Thought Pose ‚Äì Rest your chin on your hand, furrow your brows, and stare at nothing. People will assume you‚Äôre reflecting on the sermon.
‚úÖ The Strategic Amen ‚Äì Whisper ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù at random moments to blend in. If unsure when, just wait for others to say it first.

Warning: Do not overdo the nodding, or you might accidentally fall asleep.

**Chapter 5: The Exit Strategies**

Sometimes, you just need to get out. Here‚Äôs how to leave early or avoid going altogether.

üöΩ The Bathroom Escape ‚Äì Stand up confidently and walk out. If anyone asks later, say you had a stomach ache.
üìÖ The Fake Appointment ‚Äì Mention you have a medical checkup, school project, or family errand that ‚Äúsadly‚Äù conflicts with worship service.
ü§í The Sickness Excuse ‚Äì ‚ÄúI think I have a fever.‚Äù Works best if you fake a cough or look slightly miserable before service starts.

Advanced Move: If you live far from the chapel, offer to ‚Äúgo ahead‚Äù of your family, then accidentally miss the service while hanging out somewhere else.

**Conclusion: Become a Master of Church Survival**

By using these tactics, you can:
‚úÖ Keep your money instead of handing it over.
‚úÖ Enjoy snacks & drinks while enduring the service.
‚úÖ Use your phone for studying or entertainment.
‚úÖ Avoid unnecessary attention & blend in.
‚úÖ Even find ways to escape altogether.

At this point, INC isn‚Äôt controlling you‚Äîyou‚Äôre just using their forced services as your own personal break time. Stay smart, stay stealthy, and most importantly‚Äîdon‚Äôt let them take your hard-earned ‚Ç±50.

Master these strategies, and you‚Äôll never suffer through a dull worship service again.",4,1741952491.0,exIglesiaNiCristo,2,1.0,False

Sharing my journey and problems I faced and also sharing to others who might have these problems. This post is made by me to share what i experienced and not in bad intentions.


1. First problem is faced is ""Buying an off brand moka pot"". I was a coffee drinker for a while and always take from cafes in my area. One day, I found a mokapot on sale in a market and bought it. It never make a good brew. Spuddering too soon, making burnt coffee, bad build quality. Even when I'm making all steps correct (in my experience), I never get a slowly streaming cup of moka. That's until I decided to buy Bialetti Moka Express and BOOM (:. I got it right on the first time. That slowly streaming coffee goodness.


2. Number 2 is obsessing with ""crema"". When I found out that people are getting ""crema"" from mokapot, I wanted to get them so bad. After trying every possible thing, I never get them. That's when I found out from researching and from my good friends from this sub. ""Crema"" was never possible. It's just foam of coffee ( carbon dioxide in the coffee produce bubbles). It's what you taste that matters not the looks of it.



3. WDT is nessesary if you only have pre-ground coffee. WAIT HEAR ME OUT. Once I got a good brew from my bialetti. I started trying out different coffee brands. Most of them from my country or local. I always buy them in the form of fine ground. They said it's good for mokapot and espresso which is way too fine. I do every steps the same but the coffee it CAME OFF SPUDDER AND BURNT. I was disappointed that day. But the fine coffee grounds i used the first time isn't that way. I decided to compare them and noticed the first one is coarser than the second one. I saw wdt helps with it and I tried it. I reduce the dose too. It becomes good again. Not spuddering too soon or burnt. In my opinion that is because of grounds are too packed and wdt tool make them loose. Just what I thought abt.


4. A good grinder will increase the quality of your moka brew significantly. That's what I found out 2 days ago. I bought a manual grinder online, test it out with my moka. It made it more aromatic, better after taste, taste ""fresher"" and finally it makes the process much more interesting. I was happy to implement grinding to my daily coffee making. People say your arms will get tired but I think it's worth it for me. Investing in a good grinder is a significant improvement. 

5. This is probably the most important part. Enjoy your coffee and the process of making it. Others opinion doesn't matter (unless it's good for you). Let's just say if you enjoy your coffee chewed and downed with hot water, then you enjoy it. People can say bad comments online but it's your enjoyment that matters.


Thank you all for reading. I enjoy my mokapot 2 times almost everyday. Grinding, measuring the dose, and watching my moka brew slowly and steadily coming out. Dopamine I got from it is unimaginable üòÜ. Anyways, hope your moka brews are good everyday and enjoy your coffee. Peace out ‚úåÔ∏è ",4,1741952214.0,mokapot,0,0.7,False

1jb1re3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jb1re3/i_cant_breathe_anymore/,I can't breathe anymore...,"Nov. 29th I moved into a shared living thingy (Betreutes Wohnen in german) in hopes my life would get better when I do.

No one warned me. No one prepared me. Not one person, not one single soul said ANYTHING. At all. They ALL knew it. That it's draining. That it affects the mental health to a point where you're standing in the office in front of a carer crying. Breaking. Being angry and desperate. Wanting to slam things. Destroy that damn wrong-tuned guitar he is torturing you with.

You want to take away his door he's slamming constantly. You want to shove him through his fucking window he doesn't know you can close WITHOUT slamming it.

What am I talking about?

November 29 2024 I moved into a room in this house I am living in because I couldn't manage to live alone anymore. I don't know how to explain it in english, the translations don't bring it across accurate enough. It's SOME sort of assisted living (?) I think. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Where I still somehow manage my life but have people help me with stuff. It's something where people with mental health issues are living.

I am a 45, almost 46 year old female. I managed to live alone from 19 to 45, from 1998 to 2024. In the end it just got worse to a point where I couldn't do it anymore. I broke. I needed help.

So I moved into this house. Oblivious to what awaited me. Had I known that... I probably would've reconsidered and looked for another place. They can't do that to you. Yet they do.

Next to my room a man has his room. I share the part of this house with 3 men. But this one particular man... He breaks me.

He screams. Every day. He slams his door. Every day. He slams his window. Every day. He ""plays"" on his mistuned guitar. Often. He rams himself into our shared and paper thin wall. He slams his hands angainst it. Slams stuff into it. Every. Fucking. Day.

He screams. Every. Fucking. Day.

Talks to his reflection. I took a mirror off the wall right in front of my door because he kept talking to it and I could hear him through my door. I hid it in our living room until it's been taken away. I don't know where it is now but I also don't care. I asked him multiple times if he doesn't have a mirror in his room he can talk to.

He recently got new furniture because I kept breaking his.

He's making a huge mess. Everywhere he goes. He's not closing or even locking the bathroom door. I've seen him standing there peeing. I closed the door telling him to please do that himself. He doesn't listen. He's leaving the bathroom in a filthy and gross condition. He smokes in there. We aren't allowed to smoke inside the building at all. I am so happy I do NOT have to share that bathroom with him.

We have two bathrooms. The right one is for him and another housemate. The left one for me and the third man. We keep our bathroom clean and tidy. But.

This screaming mess of a human often uses ours. How do I know? Well. The mess he leaves. Open toilet with not flushed remains of what he put there. Coffee stains on the sink. Tobacco all over the floor. It's gross. But it's probably once or twice in two weeks he uses our bathroom so I can KINDA bear that.

He screams. Almost every night. He walks through the house. Almost every night. He slams doors, windows, walls. Almost every night. He STOMPS on the stairs when he walks up and down. How does he make that much noise? He's so skinny, he can't weigh more than 60 kg or something. If even that much.

He screams at the voices in his head to shut up. He says we should label our bathrooms so he doesn't walk into the wrong one.

We did? They put our names on the doors. He still walks into the wrong one from time to time and it's just gross.

I am so stressed. I once was still stressed MINUTES after he slammed his door again. It was so loud. I often fall out of my bed (exxaggerating here) when he does that.

I can't breathe. I fall asleep and in that same second I gasp for air.

I am dying. I jump out of bed anxious as hell to avoid that.

^(I'm not really dying, it just feels as if I do.)

I am shaking. I am crying.

I screamed at him multiple times because you mostly don't come through to him. Now I got told off for that.

I am breaking. I needed help to get and feel better and the only topic I have each fucking day is this mentally unstable dude who makes my life hell.

My vision is messed up. My nerves are tensed up to a point where they're ripping.

They say they're on it. That it will have an end soon. I only believe them when I see it. He says he wants to go to the psychiatry. He doesn't find the way there. He's back the night he said he's going. Why aren't they bringing him? He gets lost so easily. And then is back. Terrorizing us with his screaming and slamming stuff.

They asked me if my psychiatrist can't prescribe something to ME so I can calm down. No? That's symptom treating? But we need to treat the CAUSE?

I‚Äôve been posting a bit on this sub lately, mostly in comments/answers but I thought I‚Äôd sit down and take the time to write out whats has really helped me ‚Äòcure‚Äô this affliction. I say ‚Äòcure‚Äô, because there are still occasional times like when I haven‚Äôt gotten laid for a while, or I am super horny, and its still pretty quick (like 2 minutes) but most of the time I am able now to last as long as I want! Which is a game changer when it comes to my confidence. !!¬†

Prior to this there were times I would ejaculate on entry! Literally, a one pump chump. (actually didn‚Äôt even get the 1 pump in). I still cringe thinking about some of the times it happened.

It‚Äôs taken me a good few years to find out what really works and this sub has definitely been a help. ¬†

I looked at curing my PE like loosing weight, or putting on muscle, or generally any other issue that affects the body. There are the easy fixes (mostly drugs/medication/pills) or there are the harder but more permanent and long lasting holistic ways that also take a bit longer. i wanted a prober cure and luckily my partner was patient and understanding while I tackled this problem.

I was pretty methodical in trying out different things and I really wanted to do this naturally with out drugs or numbing creams, although the numbing creams can help if you are in a jam, but I wanted a long term CURE - not just a band aid on a broken arm. ¬†

So while researching, I tried each technique that I found and recorded how I responded to each one over at least 6 weeks. And if I saw any difference in 4-6 weeks I would add that to my routine.¬† So it‚Äôs not just one thing that worked for me - it was a combination in the end.¬†

I researched an absolute truckload on the ejaculation response. It‚Äôs a¬† pretty complex system, but for ease I‚Äôll break it down into 3 categories: mental, neurological (nerves), and physical (muscular). And all of these relying on a chemical component that tells the body what to do.¬† My understanding is that SSRI‚Äôs affect this chemical pathway to lengthen time to PONR, but at what cost?

I could go on for ages explaining every details of information I gathered (and some of the strange things I tried) but I‚Äôll get straight to what helped me the most in getting to a point of controlling when I orgasim.¬†

Here‚Äôs what worked for me:

**Quit porn -**

¬†just reading the posts on here (reddit) confirmed for me how badly this affects a mans sex life. Seriously, just quit.¬† It will f-up your sex life!

**NOFAP -**

¬†goes hand in hand with no porn. And if you are going to jerk off, restrict it as much as you can, and make sure you are not rushing it and training your system to cum quickly. And stop just doing for the dopamine hit, do it only if you are extremely horny. ¬†

**Take the mental pressure off** \- ¬†

If you have a long term partner, talk it out with her. Be vulnerable - it‚Äôs hard, but she probably already knows you got the problem. be honest about how it makes you feel etc.¬† Tell her you are trying to solve it.¬† This helps with that expected performance anxiety you will have built up in your head, if you are anything like me.¬†

If you are highly stressed, find a mindfulness practice. I found I definitely cum quicker when I am stressed out and not mentally de-stressing. Being in a parasympathetic state will help big time.

**Diet**

After months of nutritional research, I cut out caffeine and creatine. I was definitely taking excessive amounts of caffeine between all the coffee and pre-workout i was using, and I find my muscles feel much tighter when I am using creatine. I have slowly introduced much smaller amounts of these back into my diet, but stoping them definitely made a difference. ¬†

Supplementing Magnesium and Vitamin D3. I could write a whole book about all the supplements, herbs and nootropics I tried and spent a small fortune on. But these 2 made the most difference.¬† And the overall improvement to my life that high dose Vitamin D3 made to me was astounding - and I‚Äôm pretty fit and healthy to start with.¬†

Obviously if you have a crappy diet, you need to sort that out as well.¬†

**In terms of exercise:**

**Get fit.**¬† Seriously!¬†

I was weight training a lot, but I started playing sport again, and after a few weeks I was noticing a difference. So I started a cardio routine twice a week and it definitely made a difference to the stretching exercises and stuff that were already working. ¬†

**Do proper kettle bell swings -** again, I could explain how this all works, but trust me it works. After a few weeks of incorporating this to my gym routine, the time I lasted in missionary really got longer.¬†

**Reverse Kegels** \- learn how to do them properly.¬† I found them most effective in Happy Baby Pose. It took a few weeks to build the mind muscle-connection, but there is a reason these are mentioned in this sub so often. They work when you learn to do them right.¬† I‚Äôm actually incorporating Kegels with the reverse ones now to see what happens. It‚Äôs supposed to give you super hard errections. (I‚Äôm almost 50).¬†

**Glute Bridges.**¬† \- again, learn to do them properly.¬† They work!!

I am very consistent with all the above, and my control has just got better and better.¬† To the point that honestly, sometimes my wife will ask me to finish!!¬† Best words you'll ever hear!!!

I do the exercises 3 times a week for approximately 20 minutes a session. There are times I have been stressed or travelling and let it slip, and although I have never gone back to 2-stroke-bloke status, I definitely have a harder time maintaining control.¬†

The one thing I could never master was the breathing during sex. When I‚Äôm getting laid, I don‚Äôt wanna think about anything else other than enjoying myself and pleasing my partner, so that went out the window pretty quickly.¬† It may help some other guys, but I just couldn‚Äôt get it right,

Anyway, The combination of all the above worked for me. **BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT THE WORK IN CONSISTENTLY AND OVER TIME TO SEE RESULTS**. It‚Äôs just like anything you want to be good at. ¬†

I really hope this helps some of you out there. You can overcome this. Trust me. But it takes knowledge, work, patience and consistency.¬†",4,1741951563.0,PrematureEjaculation,2,1.0,False

Just thought I'd share it for those who need to hear it now.

I don't buy expensive ceremonial grade stuff but a cheaper version used for baking, etc. I took both, and the only difference is cheaper grade is more bitter, which is fine with me. I sweeten it with Stevia and make latte with lots and lots of milk. You can use alternative milk if intolerant.

Things had been getting better until 5/6 weeks and then it all went to shit. She has smaller wake windows now - about 45 minutes before getting overtired.

She suddenly forgot how to poop and is full of gas. Also, decided her bassinet is lava and will only sleep on me or next to me (SS7). Dad has been shipped to the guest room for the time being.

I have a long maternity leave, until October, and I always thought that was a good thing. Oh how I wish I HAD to put her in daycare earlier and go back to work so I could get a break!

She used to sleep okay, waking 2-3 times to nurse and go back down easily when cosleeping. But her gas pains ramped up this week and she‚Äôll wake up in pain every hour.

Yes I‚Äôm doing gas drops and bicycle kicks and using the windi. I‚Äôve tried many things. 

She also only contact naps since her bassinet became lava. And she‚Äôs more awake now so it‚Äôs harder to get her to sleep, she‚Äôll fight it so much even if she is dead tired.

She won‚Äôt take a pacifier or a bottle because everyone says to wait to introduce it after BF is established, big mistake! 

Some nights I don‚Äôt even eat dinner because at 7pm she falls asleep for the night and I have to be next to her for her to stay asleep, otherwise it‚Äôs a screaming match.

Her cry is so loud! Like, people who witness it all comment on how loud she is. At the baby massage classes she is the loudest, crying over every other baby. 
And she is upset all the time, overtired for 30 seconds - screams, gas pain - screams, startled awake - screams, straining to poop - screams, hungry - screams. 

My whole day is based around soothing her and stopping her from crying. Sometimes I let her cry because I can‚Äôt take it anymore, my back hurts and I‚Äôm exhausted!

My partner is back at work so I can only count on him over the weekend and my mom comes over every other day for a couple of hours to help me out. 

When does this get easier? When can I just put her in her stroller and go shopping or grab coffee?

Also, I‚Äôm getting married in 3 months and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to manage everything. The venue had been booked since 2022. We had been trying for a baby for 1 and half years and the moment we decided to stop was when I got pregnant. My baby was supposed to be much older by now if things ended up differently.

The guilt was too much,"My account got glitched and I can't post anything, so I had to quickly make a new one. I will put the original post here, and the update I had written. I can't fix my other account, but I really need to vent

Original post

I 27m and my husband 26M got together when he was 17 and I was 19. He was one of em popular boys who I thought was straight and even if he wasn‚Äôt I thought he wouldn‚Äôt even give me an ounce of attention. He was a jock and I was an overweight chubby guy but somehow someway we got together and faced a lot of hardships.¬†

His dad threatened to disown him when he found out. And my then boyfriend told his dad how he loves him too much and always looked up to him and even enlisted just because he wanted to be like his dad. But being into men is something he cannot change or suppress. So eventho he loves his dad, he chooses me.¬†

We got married 3 years ago. And moved into our home. Chores split, we get along just amazing, sex life is good. We make good money. He makes comfortable mid 5 figures and with 7 day security detail he does he gets to low 6 figures.¬†

He takes those 7 day details once a month and hes gone for a week and i miss him badly and I try to distract myself. So me and my friends went to a gay bar one day where I met Matty 19 who gave me a lot of attention that night which made me confused as i find it very difficult to understand why someone would find me attractive. We got sexual and it went on for a lot more than id like to admit.¬†

Last week my husband was getting ready for another 7 day intel. And just seeing him excited about the plans we making for when he comes back made me spiral. He left and i cried for 3 days because i felt like shit. I cut Matty off and i was ready to admit and come clean.¬†

He came home yesterday before me. I came home he was all smiling while cooking us dinner. He rushed to greet me with a kiss. I told him we need to talk and he kept kissing me saying we will if i gave him a minute to admire me.¬†

We sat down he was holding my hand and squeezing waitin for me to say what i had to. When i told him he didn‚Äôt let go just his grip loosend and he nodded as he said Okay.¬†

He got up and ate by himself and locked himself in our bedroom. This morning when i woke up he was gone with all of his belongings. I have no clue where he is. He won‚Äôt return my calls or texts. I deserve this

Update

Whole day yesterday I was crying because of what happened and how I could be so stupid. I downed a lot of vodka and fell asleep.¬†

This morning I woke up to some noise in the bedroom. When I opened my eyes I saw my husband getting dressed. For a second I was convinced that it was all a dream. I never cheated on him, and that grumpy face of his was because he was just wakin up and he still didn‚Äôt have his coffee and cigarette and breakfast, but no. My reality is different.¬†

He told me I look a mess, to get up and shower before we are late. He sarcastically flamed me for buying the cheapest vodka I could tellin me to get my taste back and that I still have access to our finances.¬†

When I asked where are we going, thats when he gave me the most disappointing face ever as he said something like ‚ÄúHe fucked your brains out so good you forgot my brother‚Äôs birthday party?‚Äù

As I was getting up to shower I noticed a little cotton on his arm and asked him what that was about and he said his dealer was so kind to gave it to him after he shot heroin. When I didn‚Äôt react to his sarcasm he said that he went to the clinic to get tested.¬†

We went to his brother‚Äôs birthday party (I need to note that my husband is the second born out of four boys, the oldest one being 31, and the youngest turning 17 this year. He is very close with all of them. He loves his brothers a lot, and his niece always claims how my husband is her best friend. Watching him play with her broke me even more knowing that I‚Äôll never get to see him as a father of our children.¬†

Throughout the whole party he put on a play. Talking to me, having his arm around me, smiling, having those in love eyes he always did before I told him. The birthday party was just a barbecue in his brother‚Äôs backyard. And in like 3 hours we went back home.¬†

We sat in our living room and that‚Äôs when I asked where he was yesterday. He said he was in a hotel. I asked what he did and he said he went on a walk, got ice cream and an energy drink and sat on a bench listening to music and smoking cigarettes with his energy drink. He then looked at me and said ‚ÄúI was alone, didn‚Äôt have anyone with me in there‚Äù which I knew.¬†

I asked him if he had any questions about me, for his own peace of mind and the only question he asked was if I did this back when he was gone for five months for training. I told him I had not.¬†

After a short silence I asked if he wanted a divorce. To which he responded with ‚ÄúOf course you‚Äôd want that. The streets are more fun then these four walls with me‚Äù

I explained to him that I didn‚Äôt mean it like that, and midway explaining he gave me his stereotypical ‚ÄúI was being half sarcastic‚Äù look.¬†

Then he asked me if I don‚Äôt find him attractive anymore. Something that made me tear up. I told him that I really do find him very very attractive, and that he‚Äôs been the most amazing husband anyone could ask for, and this had nothing to do with his looks or personality or how he treated me, this was all on me, and me being a total idiot.¬†

Then he answered my question that he wasn‚Äôt planning on divorcing me just yet. Because he was too embarrassed to tell his father about it after he fought with his teeth and nails for that man to still see him as his son, as someone who grew up playing rugby with all his life. Someone my husband loved dearly. And he added that he didn‚Äôt want his mum to have a tainted image of me, so he was planning something, just needed time to fully wrap the plan.¬†

I asked him what until he wraps the plan, and he said that until then we have a marriage of convenience. I get to continue living the life he was providing for us (and even better one because he stated he will be taking more intels that will significantly increase his pay) and he will get to keep the charade in front of his family as a happily married man. He added that I can sleep with whoever I want because sex is something I will not be getting from him.¬†

I asked him if that was his way of telling me he will also be sleeping around. And he said that his hand is fully functional, and that if in case he has the urge and yarning for another body, he will not deny himself the right that he granted me.¬†

I asked him if I will be taking the couch and he reminded me of our rule number one since we have lived together, that no matter how mad one person is to the other, no one ever sleeps on the couch, the bedroom is still shared.¬†

I pointed out how he locked me out the bedroom two days ago and he told me that he unlocked the bedroom before he went to bed. I just never bothered to check.¬†

We moved to our bedroom. And as I was getting ready to go to bed i noticed him checking me out, I could see that he was still looking at me with those eyes he did whenever he‚Äôd try to make a move on me in the bedroom. But he just got up and went to the bathroom, and came back dressed in sweatpants and tshirt and got into bed. Which really messed me up as he is literally allergic to sleep in clothes. His family has told me the story how when he was a baby he would only be able to sleep if he wasn‚Äôt clothed and how he grew up into a teenager like that, and then into an adult who can barely tolerate the blanket touching him.¬†

Before we went to sleep , something came over me and I told him I loved him. It‚Äôs something we always said to each other before bed. He was quiet and then said ‚ÄúI love you more‚Äù.¬†

I don't know what came over me for the second time when I turned to face him. He had his back turned toward me, but I scooted over closer to him and I wrapped my hand around him, spooning him. He didn't react, not even a change in his breathing. He just laid still, and that's when I realized that this was the first ever time in almost 10 years that I'm spooning him. It was always either him spooning me, or me laying on his chest, or him laying on top of me.

I'm a bit taller than him, so having him in my arms like this felts surreal, if only I could transfer all the pain  I've caused him, if only I didn't cause him any pain. I couldn't fight myself and I gave him a kiss on the back of his neck and he just responded with ""I wish you didn't tell me. I would've been happier not knowing that you're makin a fool out of me"" It teared me up. He fell asleep in my arms but I stayed up all night crying and that's when I decided that I wanted to be better, and to try to undo as much of the damage as I did. I will better myself. I will try my best and I will fight for us until he decides enough was enough and he serves me the papers.

1jb1gxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderau/comments/1jb1gxg/i_am_giving_away_some_chest_binders/,I am GIVING AWAY some chest binders! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è,"*Before I start, and before anyone worries, I spoke with the community mods to check this was okay before posting.*

  
I'll spare you all the details but, TLDR, I've lost a significant amount of weight recently and, as such, a bunch of my things no longer fit me - including my binders. Sad for me. But GREAT NEWS for a few of you, perhaps. I know that binders are expensive and that a lot of people can't afford them so I want to give them away to one, or a few, of you who might need them and otherwise not be able to afford them. Or maybe you only own one and need another couple so that your one isn't all stinky-stanky? Either way...

The binders I have to give away are:

* 2x Underworks '997' Black (XL size) - This is a full 'tank top' style and would fit someone with a chest size of 112-120cm (measured around the fullest part of your chest, over the nipples without clothing).
* 2x Underworks '943' White (L size) - This is a shorter crop style and would fit someone with a chest size of 102-109cm (measured the same as above).
* 1x Underworks '943' Black (XL size) - Another shorter crop style, fitting someone with a chest size of 112-120cm (measured the same as above).

If you would like any of these binders, please don't hesitate to comment or DM me. They are entirely FREE, I'd just ask that you cover postage - which is \~$15 within Australia (or $25+ if you're outside of Australia and reading this). I'd obviously need your details in order to post to you, but am more than happy to ship to things like a parcel locker. I just want to find someone (or some people) who could get some use out of these binders.

Also, I should note, these are all (obviously) pre-loved and worn. They have been washed and will be washed again thoroughly prior to shipping. They are all in great condition and are structurally fine but the white ones are stained in part because I am clumsy and have spilled coffee onto myself more than I care to mention.",11,1741950922.0,transgenderau,2,1.0,False

1jb1gir,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1jb1gir/dn_friendly_apartment_available_on_monday_in/,Dn friendly apartment available on Monday in Manila - next to Uptown Mall in BGC,"Hi, my partner and I have been staying in BGC for the past two months at Avida Towers Verte (next to Uptown Mall), but we're heading to Thailand next week. Our landlord asked if I could help find new tenants, so here goes...

The one-bedroom apartment is fully equipped with everything you need to work online, cook, and relax comfortably. Rent is 35k PHP per month, with a preferred minimum stay of two months. We've already purchased two lift passes that you can use.

The WiFi has been stable at 50 Mbps unlimited (included in the rent), but you can upgrade the speed at an extra cost. The apartment includes a coffee machine, ergonomic desk and chair, stylish decor (he's an architect), stove, small oven, wardrobe, sofa bed, ceiling fan, air con (in the bedroom) and washing machine. It's truly cozy and homely space. 

The building has a small gym and swimming pool, and there are literally hundreds of cafes, restaurants, and shops within walking distance. Grab, FoodPanda,

Tropical Mango Tiramisu Recipe
Ingredients
For the Mango Pur√©e:

2-3 ripe mangoes, peeled and chopped (3 recommended for best results)
2 tablespoons sugar (optional, depending on sweetness of mangoes)
1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)

For the Cream Filling:

250g mascarpone cheese, room temperature
160g heavy cream/whipping cream
Powdered sugar to taste (approximately 4-6 tablespoons)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
5g gelatin (about 1¬Ω teaspoons) + 3 tablespoons hot water

For the Assembly:

Approximately 13 ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi), adjust based on your dish size
1 cup milk
Mango pur√©e (for dipping mixture)
Extra mango pur√©e for topping and middle layer
Fresh mango slices for garnish (optional)

Instructions

Prepare Mango Pur√©e:

Blend 2 of your mangoes until completely smooth
If needed, add sugar and lemon juice to taste
Set aside


Prepare Gelatin:

Sprinkle gelatin over hot water and stir until completely dissolved
Let cool slightly but don't let it set


Make Cream Filling:

In a bowl, whip heavy cream until soft peaks form
In another bowl, beat mascarpone until smooth
Gradually add powdered sugar to taste and vanilla to mascarpone
Add several tablespoons of mango pur√©e to the mascarpone mixture (for more intense mango flavor)
Add dissolved gelatin and mix well
Gently fold whipped cream into mascarpone mixture until combined


Prepare Dipping Mixture:

In a shallow bowl, combine milk with some mango pur√©e
Mix well


Assemble Tiramisu:

Quickly dip ladyfingers into mango-milk mixture (don't soak)
Arrange dipped ladyfingers in a single layer in serving dish
Spread half the cream mixture over ladyfingers
If using a third mango, add a layer of fresh mango slices or additional pur√©e
Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers
Top with remaining cream mixture
Spread remaining mango pur√©e on top
Create decorative swirls with a toothpick


Chill:

Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight
Garnish with fresh mango slices before serving (optional)



Pro Tips for Perfecting Your Mango Tiramisu

Third Mango Magic: Using that third mango makes a huge difference! Reserve it for layering between the cream and as decoration on top for maximum visual appeal and flavor intensity.

Mango Selection: Choose fully ripe, fragrant mangoes with slight give when pressed. Alphonso, Ataulfo, or Kent varieties work particularly well for their rich flavor.

Adjustable Sweetness: Taste your mangoes first - if they're very sweet, you can reduce the amount of powdered sugar in the cream mixture.

Don't Oversoak: Quickly dip the ladyfingers (1-2 seconds per side) - they absorb liquid quickly and will get too soggy if soaked too long.

Room Temperature Mascarpone: Using room temperature mascarpone prevents lumps and ensures smooth incorporation with other ingredients.

Gelatin Tip: Make sure your gelatin is completely dissolved in hot water before adding to avoid any unpleasant texture issues in the final dessert.

Ladyfinger Arrangement: For a smaller dish like yours, you may need to break some ladyfingers to fit perfectly around the edges.

Make-Ahead Magic: This dessert actually improves after 24 hours as flavors meld together.

Serving Suggestion: For a beautiful presentation in your video, dust the top with a little powdered sugar right before serving for contrast against the yellow mango.

Storage Tip: This tiramisu keeps well in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, but the vibrant mango color is most impressive in the first 48 hours.",1,1741950485.0,tiramisu,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm up a little earlier today to do the last minute procrastination turnaround - but not intentionally or WANTING to work from home, but my ADHD literally CANNOT focus at plan time (I‚Äôm a prekindergarten teacher at a reputable child development center), because someone is always in the room with me, in break or planning themselves, or I'm trying to concentrate and read in the dark at naptime with fidgetiy kids I can't tune out until my second dose of addy kicks in, and even then I stilll don't accomplish much. Anyway, last minute, posting here quickly like a game before my printer is done, kick its ass and bust ass and knock it out with a win to start off the weekend. AKA, I'm in a panic survivial mode. I missed a (truly minor) deadline last Friday, but I‚Äôm making up for it today, and currently going to work on finishing something due today. I will also be bringing work home to do on the weekend, despite ‚Äúthe rules‚Äù. Hello, if you want me to succeed, allow an exception (we aren‚Äôt technically supposed to plan/prep/work/from home). 

But it's Friday. It's a flippin‚Äô child care center I work at ffs, I take it too seriously. a 90% is still an A. I don't need an A+ performance. I'll settle for a B+ even. I‚Äôm a rockin‚Äô kick ass, 30 year experience in the field educator of children ages 4-5 getting ready for kindergarten and prep schools. I absolutely love it. I ‚Äúget‚Äù their HUGE curious and creative minds, and their emotionally disregulated bodies (thanks to this sub helping me understand myself after all these years, and able to understand and expand and apply my knowledge in Early Childhood Development). Believe it or not, this mindset has not been easy to develop with my self critical perfectionist issues and rejection sensitivity I‚Äôve lived with most of my 48 years. I have TO DO lists always going, but next to it I keep a list of other things I‚Äôve also gotten done, so I can feel successful and reflect on how I can make adjustments and find tools to help in prioritizing tasks and break down goals. 

Yup, yup, already owning it this morning. After a tough ish week. That's literally why I work from home because, medicated or not, I can't focus with people around me, but I can with a TV in the background. The medicine mainly makes it so I have executive function, now, I can actually GET UP and do XYZ without much lag or thinking about it, even if I still wanna drag my feet because duh, a lot of stuff is no fun. And the squirrels are more in a row now. Still lot's of thoughts, just now more, as I picture it, one thought at a time, in a line, and they can cycle back around by going to the end of the line... and they can be racing... but now it's not as fast and they aren't all jabbing at my brain for attention from all angles, like an imploding starbust.

I'll try to keep it as short as possible, with only the most important info you need to understand the situation.

I've (M23) matched and been talking to a girl (F20) online for a few days. 
After 4 days of talking, she ghosted for a while, i asked if everythings alright and if she's still interested (after a few days of not hearing anything back).

After 2 weeks she surprisingly responded and told me life's been very stressful lately and that she's sorry and that she didn't wanna ghost me.
I told her if she wants, we can talk about it, but the decision is hers if she wants to talk about what's been bothering her or not.

She then told me some school problems and the (in my opinion) main problem:
It's because she has something going on with a guy right now.
She has smth casual going and wanted something serious with him, but he doesn't, she wants to leave him now but it's extremly hard (she caught feelings i guess).
At the end said she hopes that this info isn't completely repelling and basically hints that she hopes i still want to talk/keep contact.

I made a longer answer basically saying, i understand her situation, but it is off putting, it feels to me like she caught feelings and it's not fair in that case, neither for me nor her if we wanna start getting to know each other more seriously, because it simply wont work if she has feelings for another guy, or ""had"" if we wants to try and move on and then meet up with me.
Well i told her that i'm open for a 1st date if she thinks she can end the things with him and can tell me she's not emotionally invested into him (anymore).

I'll wait for her answer now, i really respect her being honest, i REALLY do, i mean she could have also just lied to me, most people would have i guess.
It speaks for her good character, she's also pretty and seemingly easy to talk to, she has some cool interest and i think we could really get along.
But idk how to feel about there potentially being feelings for that other guy, even if she's gonna say ""i'm over him let's meet"" it would all still be pretty recent for her and i just dk if it could even work out, EVEN IF she wants to meet up AND would like to see me again afterwards.

So in the case she says she'd like to meet up for a coffee or something, do you think this could work out?
Like i said, i really feel like we could get along, she seems cute and smart, emotionally inteligent, honest (<- huge plus for me) and our interest even somewhat align, she also likes video games which is super cool.
But that thing with her situationship is really off putting, on the other hand, idk if i'm just being overly jealous or smth like that, or if it is as big of a red flag as i think it is.

Tropical Mango Tiramisu Recipe
Ingredients
For the Mango Pur√©e:

2-3 ripe mangoes, peeled and chopped (3 recommended for best results)
2 tablespoons sugar (optional, depending on sweetness of mangoes)
1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)

For the Cream Filling:

250g mascarpone cheese, room temperature
160g heavy cream/whipping cream
Powdered sugar to taste (approximately 4-6 tablespoons)
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
5g gelatin (about 1¬Ω teaspoons) + 3 tablespoons hot water

For the Assembly:

Approximately 13 ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi), adjust based on your dish size
1 cup milk
Mango pur√©e (for dipping mixture)
Extra mango pur√©e for topping and middle layer
Fresh mango slices for garnish (optional)

Instructions

Prepare Mango Pur√©e:

Blend 2 of your mangoes until completely smooth
If needed, add sugar and lemon juice to taste
Set aside


Prepare Gelatin:

Sprinkle gelatin over hot water and stir until completely dissolved
Let cool slightly but don't let it set


Make Cream Filling:

In a bowl, whip heavy cream until soft peaks form
In another bowl, beat mascarpone until smooth
Gradually add powdered sugar to taste and vanilla to mascarpone
Add several tablespoons of mango pur√©e to the mascarpone mixture (for more intense mango flavor)
Add dissolved gelatin and mix well
Gently fold whipped cream into mascarpone mixture until combined


Prepare Dipping Mixture:

In a shallow bowl, combine milk with some mango pur√©e
Mix well


Assemble Tiramisu:

Quickly dip ladyfingers into mango-milk mixture (don't soak)
Arrange dipped ladyfingers in a single layer in serving dish
Spread half the cream mixture over ladyfingers
If using a third mango, add a layer of fresh mango slices or additional pur√©e
Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers
Top with remaining cream mixture
Spread remaining mango pur√©e on top
Create decorative swirls with a toothpick


Chill:

Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight
Garnish with fresh mango slices before serving (optional)



Pro Tips for Perfecting Your Mango Tiramisu

Third Mango Magic: Using that third mango makes a huge difference! Reserve it for layering between the cream and as decoration on top for maximum visual appeal and flavor intensity.

Mango Selection: Choose fully ripe, fragrant mangoes with slight give when pressed. Alphonso, Ataulfo, or Kent varieties work particularly well for their rich flavor.

Adjustable Sweetness: Taste your mangoes first - if they're very sweet, you can reduce the amount of powdered sugar in the cream mixture.

Don't Oversoak: Quickly dip the ladyfingers (1-2 seconds per side) - they absorb liquid quickly and will get too soggy if soaked too long.

Room Temperature Mascarpone: Using room temperature mascarpone prevents lumps and ensures smooth incorporation with other ingredients.

Gelatin Tip: Make sure your gelatin is completely dissolved in hot water before adding to avoid any unpleasant texture issues in the final dessert.

Ladyfinger Arrangement: For a smaller dish like yours, you may need to break some ladyfingers to fit perfectly around the edges.

Make-Ahead Magic: This dessert actually improves after 24 hours as flavors meld together.

Serving Suggestion: For a beautiful presentation in your video, dust the top with a little powdered sugar right before serving for contrast against the yellow mango.

Storage Tip: This tiramisu keeps well in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, but the vibrant mango color is most impressive in the first 48 hours.",2,1741949925.0,cookingtonight,0,1.0,False

1jb1642,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1jb1642/im_sabotaging_my_dating_life_because_im_waiting/,I'm sabotaging my dating life because I'm waiting for a soulmate,"At least I think that's what's going on. Hopefully it's not just a cope.

When I was young(er) I didn't try dating because none of the girls I knew were 'special' enough. I did have crushes, and I would overanalyze whether I can make a 'story' where that person could be my 'soulmate' so to say.

I have fallen in love again at college. I was more easygoing and open to trying out dating, accepted I'm attracted sexually to a lot of girls and was thinking whether that action happens in dormitories, but no luck meeting girls. But that girl almost felt like the one, with the only issues being I was jealous of her personality, felt inadequate and immature, and she was really unattractive to me physically. I had a hard time reconciling with the fact I'm so superficial that looks are a dealbreaker to me. I made a compromise by deciding to give her a chance, really slowly and if there really are enough green flags I'll try dating her. Except we had a hard time agreeing on time for coffee dates despite both wanting it, and  eventually she found somebody else by the time we had a good 'date'. I thought that will make it easier, but I only ended up fucked up for a few years.

When I realized I'm still attracted to many girls and that everybody else takes dating less seriously, I started hating the fact society made me believe monogamy is the answer. I realized I could be emotionally and sexually intimate with several girls, just none of them being my 'soulmate' I had a hard time deciding on what exactly I wanted, and accepting I'm too messed up for a relationship.

Just as I decided I only want casual dating, I met a girl with so many same interests that I knew I didn't want her to slip out of my life. That was the biggest red flag to me - girls similar to me only seemed to make me suffer, and I wanted to hook up with basic boring persons whom I couldn't fall in love with. It was obvious since the moment I met her this could become a relationship, but I was scared of being limited emotionally again. I pretended to be okay with any kind of relationship, and despite her seeing me as some kind of womanizer she of course wanted a relationship. The relationship had many issues, I still felt alone, and after a year and a half it broke when we were both unstable.

It's been a while, and I had no luck with dating. My ex is the only girl I ever was with. I went on a few dates,  and still think every day about a few girls, who either rejected, ghosted or blocked me already. I knew they wouldn't be good for me, but I'm practically obsessed with them because I was overthinking and finding ways to get attached to them.

I want to hook up to satisfy physical urges and to score a body count for confidence. I want to be emotionally exposed and safe. But it seems I'm subconsciously sabotaging myself because I don't feel any of them can satisfy my true desire for a soulmate. And I'm not looking for one, because obviously soulmates don't exist. I want to just let things be and accept any kind of relationship that could naturally occur with a person, but I'm sabotaging my dating because I feel like any of these girls would just mess me up.

A few years ago I 'solved' this by deciding to go only for completely plain and boring girls, but now I want to be with someone who is really fun at least. Or really hot. Or whom I have a lot to talk with. Basically I want to prove there are people for me. But I'm scared of consequences.

The vibe is just different to anywhere I‚Äôve lived in the UK. 

There was the odd off character but as a black fella, I didn‚Äôt feel out of place at all. A few people said I probably would but part of me thought that would be bullshit. 

- Good vibes. There‚Äôs some grand people knocking about and more willing to help you out if it is clear you‚Äôre lost or something. 

- Food scene is great. There seems to be a nice little joint for anything you can think of - also you guys seem to love your coffee! Dublin doesn‚Äôt seem like a good place for my diet though but it‚Äôs good for the soul. 

- Public transport. Much more reliable; works out better cost wise than where I‚Äôm from. (Multi modal price cap). Although it was a pain in the arse finding out that it‚Äôs cash or LEAP card only to use Dublin Bus. 

Nae worry though as I now have my LEAP!

- Cleaner. I can actually breathe, not that smog I‚Äôm used to in my little corner of south east England. 

- Walkable. We would walk down from our Airbnb in Stoneybatter to town. 

- Culture. Irish folk really are proud of their culture and heritage. Compared to some places, more so and I love it. I also like how you‚Äôll find everyone here and for the most part everybody meshes. Lots of Brazilians; lots of yanks etc‚Ä¶

I can‚Äôt wait to come back. I‚Äôd like to do Dublin again but I‚Äôd also like to see the rest that this gaffe has to offer! Maybe Cork next time.

Set my grind to 13 and get 34g out in 26s. Not a terrible shot but not amazing either, but yield is about right. 

Decrease grind by 1 to 12, but get 30g out in 27s. The shot is marginally better. 

Decrease again to 11 and get 24g out in 28s!

What might be causing the yield to decrease so much? Is it a quirk of the machine/volumetrics? It‚Äôs almost like the machine is so to run for a certain time period rather than to produce a certain volume of coffee.

Hey there!  

I‚Äôm a 25-year-old from Punjab,India , currently living in Italy‚Äîbecause apparently, I thought surviving on pasta and coffee alone was a solid life plan (no regrets so far). Living abroad has been a great journey of self-discovery, mostly realizing how much I miss home-cooked food and how bad I am at folding fitted sheets.  

A bit about me‚ÄîI‚Äôm into sports, movies, and TV shows, and I have a ""slightly"" obsessive love for Formula 1. If you also enjoy high-speed drama and questionable Ferrari strategies, we‚Äôll probably get along great. If not, don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîI promise I can talk about other things too. Like how pineapple on pizza is an unresolved international debate.  

But honestly, I think good connections are built on more than just shared interests. I value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and the kind of banter that makes you laugh at your phone like an idiot in public. Quality time is super important to me‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just having a deep conversation about life (or which fictional character had the worst plot arc).  

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn‚Äôt call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won‚Äôt argue. Probably.  

So if you‚Äôre up for a chat‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport‚Äîdrop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who‚Äôs down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.

On Friday night, my step father was found dead in his bedroom in our house. I was the first to arrive home, heard the shower running, didn't think much of it and hopped on my xhox to play a video game. And, about 20 minutes after, my mom arrived; went to her room, and her scream echoed throughout the house.


Fast foward to present, it's been an entire week. I've cried every single day since then but today I just broke down. I don't understand why this happened. I don't understand why it had to happen. I was talking to him the day before, I heard him through the walls, he was giving our cat treats at night. He was making jokes with my mom, he was playing on his own xbox, he had just retired a few years ago after being in the military for 20 years.


He had so many years ahead of him and I thought by the time I was 40 he'd still be kicking, the thought of him dying never even occurred to me, and then he's gone. I never said thank you, I never gave him the appreciation he deserved, and I never said goodbye. I won't ever be able to say goodbye he's just gone. He was there one second and then suddenly not the very next.


He wasn't sick, he was healthy, he exercised every morning, he ate healthy, he always got up early. I wasn't prepared to lose him. And now I'm thinking about all the things he won't be able to do anymore. He won't be able to boat, he won't be able to watch his favorite shows or games, or eat his favorite food, or read his favorite books, or go on walks, or drive his truck, he won't be able to smile, he won't be able to walk, he won't be able to sleep, he won't be able to drink anything. 


And I just keep crying. Why am I allowed to smile and sleep and eat and keep living if he can't? What right do I have to smile? If I hadn't gone to work that day I could've done something and now I can't do anything and I feel helpless. Everytime I go to sleep, and I wake up, I'm expecting to hear his annoying voice talking to the cat as he makes his morning cup of coffee and then I keep waiting and I cry when I realize it's not gonna happen. Everytime I've gone to sleep I just expect this to be a dream. 


Why did this happen? Why so unexpectedly? And all I can think about is how guilty I feel, and how sorry I am, and then I hate myself more. I keep thinking ""please, let me go back"" because I just want to prevent it. I'm so distraught. I haven't been out of the house since. I haven't gone to school. The only one time I left was to visit him at the funeral home and I couldn't stop crying when I saw him. I wanted to say sorry to him at least once but the words couldn't come out. My throat was hurting and my tears weren't helping. 


I wanted to say  ""sorry for disrespecting you"" ""sorry for not helping you"" ""sorry you died alone"" but I couldn't do that. 


I miss him so much and I didn't think I'd miss him so much and I don't know what to do. I keep looking him up online to see what his other family and friends have posted about him and I see pictures of him and I see him smiling and I just can't do it.",1,1741948045.0,GriefSupport,0,0.67,False

New customers will **also receive 5 free ‚Äúbeans‚Äù** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://swf3j.app.goo.gl/C9HgF)).

Pro tip, if it‚Äôs anything like Caff√® Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Enjoy the free cake I recommend the Mini Cherry Bakewell!

Let's dive deep into the details to help you decide which one suits your needs best.

### Ninja Creami: A Fun and Easy Way to Make Milkshakes

The Ninja Creami has gained popularity for its unique approach to creating frozen treats, including milkshakes. This countertop machine is designed specifically for blending and processing frozen ingredients, making it a fantastic choice for fans of homemade shakes.

Some standout features of the Ninja Creami include:

If you're someone who loves experimenting with frozen treats, the Ninja Creami is a great choice. Just add your ingredients, choose your setting, and let it do the work while you sit back and relax.

### KitchenAid Stand Mixer Attachment: A Classic Choice

If you already own a KitchenAid stand mixer, the attachment for making milkshakes is a convenient addition. This versatile tool can easily mix up your favorite shakes while also serving multiple other purposes.

Make the Perfect Ice Cream--&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com  
  
Here are a few things to consider about the KitchenAid Stand Mixer Attachment:

- **Built to Last:** KitchenAid is known for its high-quality kitchen appliances, and this attachment is no different. It is both durable and well-designed, ensuring it will stand the test of time.
- **Traditional Mixing Power:** The stand mixer's powerful motor delivers excellent blending capabilities. It can mix heavier, thicker milkshake components with ease, giving you a rich and satisfying shake.
- **Multi-functionality:** Beyond milkshakes, this attachment can help you whip cream, blend batters, and so much more, making it a versatile addition to your kitchen.

For those who appreciate classic kitchen tools and prefer a time-tested method for making milkshakes, the KitchenAid Stand Mixer Attachment is an excellent option. It allows you to maintain control over the mixing process while delivering satisfying results.

### Comparative Overview

To simplify your decision, here‚Äôs a quick comparison of both options:

- **Ease of Use:** Ninja Creami wins here with its one-touch operation and pre-programmed settings, while the KitchenAid requires a bit more manual effort.
- **Versatility:** Ninja Creami offers more frozen treat options compared to the KitchenAid‚Äôs milkshake-specific attachment.
- **Mixing Power:** The KitchenAid Stand Mixer Attachment leverages the power of your KitchenAid, making it easier to handle thicker mixtures.
- **Storage Space:** The Ninja Creami, as a standalone appliance, might take up more counter space than a KitchenAid attachment.

### Cost Considerations

When it comes to price, the Ninja Creami is usually more expensive than the KitchenAid Stand Mixer Attachment. If you're budget-conscious or already own a KitchenAid mixer, the attachment may be the better choice. However, if you‚Äôre keen on making various frozen treats frequently and value convenience, investing in a Ninja Creami could be worth it.

Bitcoin continues to move within a medium-term uptrend. We still haven‚Äôt reached a proper retest of the lower channel boundary or the trendline.

üìä RSI is sitting at 44, which is a neutral zone, meaning there is no clear directional bias yet. Bitcoin‚Äôs price is still being tested against macroeconomic conditions and political factors.

‚∏ª

üìâ Order Book & Liquidity Zones:

üîπ Key Support Zones:

‚úÖ $81,800 ‚Äì $82,000 ‚Üí Strong buy-side liquidity with over 1,200 BTC in limit orders

‚úÖ $80,500 ‚Üí Large buy interest with significant limit orders

üîπ Key Resistance Zones:

üö© $83,200 ‚Äì $83,500 ‚Üí ~850 BTC in sell orders

üö© $84,500 ‚Üí A major sell wall with ~1,100 BTC

üö© $87,000 ‚Üí Massive resistance with ~1,500 BTC in limit sell orders

‚∏ª

üî• Summary & Key Levels to Watch:

	‚Ä¢	$82,000 is confirmed as strong support, while $84,500 remains the key barrier for upside movement.

	‚Ä¢	If BTC breaks above $84,500, this will confirm an uptrend continuation, likely triggering a spike straight to $87,000.

	‚Ä¢	If BTC breaks below $81,800, we could see a retest of the lower trendline around $76,000 (though this scenario seems less likely for now).

‚∏ª

üéØ Trading Strategy for Today:

üìå If you‚Äôre looking for entry zones:

	‚Ä¢	For long-term accumulation: $80,500 ‚Äì $81,000 looks like the best area to catch a bounce.

	‚Ä¢	For short-term speculation: A breakout above $84,500 could lead to a rapid push toward $87,000.
