1mlie3g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlie3g,Cry to Heaven-themed dinner!,"Hi everyone! Back in February, I posted about having a Cry to Heaven themed dinner and finally got around to having it now in August 😅 This was a lot of fun to plan! I found these beautiful cherub plates and coffee mugs in my grandmother’s linen closet which haven’t seen the light since the 90s. For music, I played Vivaldi, Bononcini: Cantate in Soprano, and Dinner Classics: The Italian Album. For food, I tried to do more of a “nod” to locations instead of being historically accurate. For drinks, we had Pinot Grigio (white wine was referenced a lot I thought in that book) and I also made Bellinis, a famous drink from the Venetian restaurant Harry’s Bar. For appetizers, I put out grapes and prosciutto. For dinner, I made Spaghetti aglio e olio (Naples) alongside salad with balsamic vinaigrette (as suggested by one user on here when I was asking for suggestions in my first post ☺️) and grilled bread with caprese salad. For dessert, we had coffee and my sister actually picked these out and bought a small assortment of pastries. She was excited for this dinner and took a break from studying to help out as she was the one I would sob to and give her updates on Tonio and his antics 😂 anyways, this was a lot of fun and made it feel like a completion after reading CTH 💜 it got me through the winter and I’ve never read anything like it before and it hasn’t left my mind since reading it (all in the best way possible though!). I just loved the characters and this was so fun to do in their respect. Can’t recommend CTH enough! Cheers! x
(PS I would love to read more of Anne Rice’s books and recently got The Vampire Armand which I read some things that it is kinda like CTH but would love to hear other thoughts and suggestions too if there are other books out there that are best to begin with before going into this one! Thank you!)

1mlidyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1mlidyr/why_are_llms_not_the_route_to_general_capabilities/,Why are LLMs not the route to General capabilities?,"Can someone please explain to me the argument that LLMs are theoretically incapable of reaching general intelligence?

My understanding is that natural intelligence is not a single, omnipotent model “running the show,” but rather a generalizable algorithm made up of many specialized agents, each optimized for different tasks. These range from pattern recognition in vision, sound, and other sensory modalities, to something as seemingly simple as lifting a cup of coffee — with all the nuances implied, such as adjusting for the cup’s weight, temperature, and balance (think society of mind by Minsky).

We see glimpses of these specialized agents in cases of brain injury, when a particular module is taken offline and its absence reveals both its specific function and its unexpected contributions to other areas. For example, damage to the fusiform face area is known to cause prosopagnosia, or face blindness, but it can also impair the ability to tell apart other objects that require fine-grained visual discrimination, like distinguishing between similar car models, bird species, or even one’s own livestock. Similarly, injury to the cerebellum, long thought to be purely about motor control and coordination, can also disrupt language processing, working memory, and aspects of social cognition, showing that it plays a broader role in predictive modeling and error correction than previously assumed.

Given this, and considering protocols like MCP, as well as the fact that LLMs are trained on vast amounts of API-specific calls and can almost effortlessly interact with any set of tools they are exposed to, my question is: why couldn’t an ensemble of specialized agents — each trained for a specific task — theoretically accomplish what the human brain does?

I feel like I must be missing something, and I’d love to understand why some people consider the LLM route a dead end when it comes to achieving general intelligence.",1,1754720231.0,ArtificialInteligence,1,1.0,False

The waste and environmental services sector is in another busy year for mergers and acquisitions. With
Enviri/Harsco publicly announcing that it is exploring 'strategic alternatives' for its Clean Earth business,
and Waste Management (WM) awaiting regulatory approval to acquire Stericycle, some industry watchers
are wondering if we could be seeing a real-life version of *The Parent Trap*.


""In this speculative Parent Trap, WM reunites Stericycle with Clean Earth, Republic adds Harsco Rail, and Veolia quietly serves both.""

The First Twin: Clean Earth
Clean Earth operates three business units: If WM completes its Stericycle acquisition, it may seek to
expand internal treatment and disposal capacity — a move consistent with past industry consolidations. In
that case, adding Clean Earth could 'reunite' Stericycle's healthcare waste collection with compatible
processing assets.

The Second Twin: Rail
If Clean Earth changes hands, Harsco could become a rail-only company. That might appeal to Republic
Services, which already operates a nationwide rail-based hazardous waste logistics network through US Ecology. Owning Harsco Rail could expand Republic's ability to bundle rail services with disposal,
strengthening bids for infrastructure, remediation, and government projects.

The Constant: Veolia
Regardless of which 'parent' ends up with which 'twin,' major processors like Veolia would remain central
for certain high-end treatment and destruction services. Market precedent shows that these capabilities are
difficult to replicate, ensuring their role in the supply chain remains secure.

A Possible Ending
In this speculative version of *The Parent Trap*, the 'family reunion' might look like this: WM reunites
Stericycle with Clean Earth's Healthcare unit; Republic adds Harsco Rail to its network; Veolia continues as
the quiet constant, serving both. Whether it plays out that way or not, the next 12 months could be a

1mli50a,https://www.reddit.com/r/MafiaTheGame/comments/1mli50a/ideas_for_the_old_countrys_explore_mode/,Ideas for The Old Country's Explore Mode.,"I'm honestly between two camps: On one hand, I understand people who are upset about the barebones explore mode. But on the other hand, I wasn't even expecting an explore mode because of how much the developers emphasized that this is a linear, narrative and cinematic game above all else. The more I played, though, the more I found myself regretting that there isn't more to do in this gorgeous world. It is SUCH a gorgeous world. I found myself pausing every horse ride just to take in the beautiful views and hear the lovely sounds(Sound design team, magnificent job). 

As a game developer myself, I understand the presence of some restrictions and why they need to be there, so my suggestions will be minimal in the hope that if the developers see this, they could actually implement some of these suggestions:

1) It is an absolute crime that such a gorgeous game doesn't have a photo mode. It sorely needs a photo mode. I hate crouching like a goblin hugging a wall just so I can capture some of the beauty. 

2) Chess games. Doesn't need an explanation, gives you something to do in the towns.

3) Car and horse races. An incentive to expand the gameplay with further challenge. 

4) Random events. It can range from giving someone a ride to a town out in the wilderness to giving beggars money in the streets to having your shoes shined. Just little interactions here and there, doesn't need any in depth voice acting or story. 

5) Drinking and eating. Just gives players a way to sit in a cafe somewhere in the busy streets of San Celeste or take in the sea breeze in Porto Almaro while sipping on a coffee or wine.

6) Gramophone in our safe house to play music.   
  
7) Various ambient spots where we can sit or lean and have a smoke, can be in the towns, in the safe house, under a tree in the wilderness  
  
Of course I don't need to point out the obvious, such as the ability to change time of day and weather, but this is my hopes of things to be added. I'm having a wonderful time playing this game, truly. And I can absolutely tell the developers didn't just enjoy crafting it, but they themselves fell in love with it. You can see passion in everything on the screen. I hope they let us immerse ourselves in and enjoy this gorgeous world as much as they have. ",3,1754719323.0,MafiaTheGame,0,1.0,False

About me:
•	Born and raised in the Philippines. I speak tagalog fluently.

•	Above average looking (at least that’s what I’ve been told).
•	Voracious reader. I have a huge library of books.
•	I’m a petrol head. No vices except for collecting cars (if that counts). There are times that I just sit on my garage while sipping coffee.
•	When I’m not working, I always travel. I love the Americas, Europe and Asia. But for some reason, Paris, Rome and Osaka are my absolute favorites.
•	I am a certified food lover! I always book a food tour when I travel.
•	I always listen to the news both local and I am up-to-date on whatever is happening in the Philippines. I watch TFC.

What I’m looking for:

•	Ages 25-40. Normal BMI and above average looks is a plus.
•	Someone who works in healthcare is preferable. (We all understand the nature, demands and constraints of our jobs).
•	Non-smoker, passenger princess and not afraid to ride in sports cars. Someone who will have an impecable playlist while we drive by the ocean.

How do I change his mind?"," I 28F and my boyfriend 35M have been dating for 3 years now, and I can’t get over this *one* problem - everything else is peaches and cream. Or I wouldn’t be in SUCH an emotional pickle. 

I have been in medical school for a couple years now. When we met, I was applying and hoping to stay local. We fell hard and fast - and I even considered not going to medical school to remain close by, but had worked SO hard to throw it all away. I would hardcore judge a girl to give up her dream of any kind for a dude, especially a dude you’ve known less than a year. It was a gut wrenching choice to move away to pursue my dream. However, we have made long distance work and never go longer than a month without seeing each other. 

My problem is that my bf continuously, and I mean ALL THE TIME, shits on me in school. I am happy with an 75 on a difficult exam - well did I exceed the average, not just the median? Okay so I get an 85 and pass the average, but should he be proud if I don’t USUALLY beat out everyone? Why would he be proud, if I’m 28 and still in school? (Mind you, I started at 26, and that was our average age of matriculation that year). If I buy him dinner - should he be grateful if I’m using “loan money” and I am actually not providing it myself? (I do budget closely to live off our living allowance, so splurging for others does impact me).

I know it frustrates him that I do not have an income, and that we do long distance. I just feel constantly weighed down by the negative comments. I AM PROUD OF ME. I worked sooo hard to get here, and faced unusual obstacles to do so. I love helping people. It energizes my soul I guess? And it keeps me from being depressed as it gives me purpose. Also, I think most people who go to medical school are proud of it, because it’s difficult to do. 

He is a very supportive bf in many ways - I found out I had a very mild form of cancer at the start of school, and since was diagnosed with a genetic condition, along with some members of my family. My younger sibling will need a heart transplant this year and I will need a pacemaker. He took time of work and worked remote to help me for several months. I know he loves me. I just don’t understand how he can love me, but not love a core part of what makes me, ME. I volunteer a lot with women and children, and care a lot about what I do. I am very passionate about helping others, and have a “free spirit” as my mom says, where I don’t think about materialism as a motivator. 

Full disclosure, I do have about 10k in credit card debt from my early twenties that I have been paying off. I am on my family’s phone plan. I pay all of my own expenses otherwise. When my bf and I met, we did a lot 50/50 as I worked during my masters program. I am not able to do that now but do still buy dinners/coffees/gifts regularly, just at a lower value. My bf makes a VERY healthy salary - more than a pediatrician. 

How do I solve this? I love him and he loves me. Im a pretty good communicator. He knows this hurts me. But I don’t know how to understand him or change his mind. Help. ",1,1754718980.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

I've got a proclivity for Japanese design so I'm really attracted to the look of these ranges in terms of pure form, I don't know anyone who uses one so I wanted to ask if the function measures up to the good looks before I buy and if it's worth the price, although it seems pretty comparable to other units right now. Part of me has a feeling that there's a hefty hype factor involved here, idk, could just be me.

It really got me thinking about how we often underestimate the power of nature, notably the nature we curate ourselves. The study detailed the various stages, from clearing out the debris (apparently, a surprising number of old tires were involved!) to amending the soil and finally planting things that brought visual appeal and, crucially, were easy to maintain.

What struck me most was the emphasis on making it a *daily* experience. It wasn't just about creating a pretty space,but about incorporating it into the daily routine. Things like a small herb garden right outside the kitchen door, or a comfortable bench placed strategically to encourage a fast morning coffee surrounded by greenery.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? What were the key factors that made your garden revival a success, and how did you integrate it into your daily life for sustained enjoyment? I'm especially interested in stories about low-maintenance solutions and how to overcome the initial overwhelm of a really neglected space.",1,1754718662.0,RhythmOfTheHearth,0,1.0,False

I (23M) am studying in the US but currently in Canada for an internship in another university. I met this girl in a coffee shop on campus, and decided to talk to her and say hi. She was studying but we ended up talking for a good 30-40 mins. We laughed a lot, she was looking at me deep in the eyes and asked me a lot of questions. I ended up asking for her phone number but she gave me her ig because apparently she uses it more often.

I asked her if she wanted to get coffee on the weekend, to which she agreed. She didn’t protest when I called it a date. She did mention, however, that she is very busy (studies + job), so we ended up meeting 2 weeks later. She made a lot of effort to show up although she was pretty tired from work. I (and I think we) had a really good time, we sat in a park and were really curious about each other, there was also some gentle banter/flirt. She didn’t pull back when I touched her arm or her back, but I’m thinking maybe she was too embarrassed to say anything. Then I decided to get serious and ask what she was expecting for us — because I was seeing it as a date. She seemed surprised, thanked me for my honesty, and said she wanted to get to know each other and take things slow. She also brought up the issue of the distance, which I acknowledged, but I’m ready to travel to see her again if things work out. Before leaving we agreed to meet again and she asked me to text her. Overall it went well although she did refuse a hug (she said she doesn’t do hugs).

I texted her early this week to meet again but she said she was really busy because of the finals, and we both agreed to meet next weekend. I respected that and left her alone. However I will be leaving in 3-4 weeks and I am starting to wonder if this is worth giving it a chance given the short span of time and her being really busy. I really appreciate her and would like to make things work, but I don’t want to get in her way and she also seems more ambiguous to me (of course I don’t blame her, we’ve only had 2 interactions so far) — I am always starting conversations. I can’t tell if this is because she is not interested or because she is very busy (or both). I think I just need some opinion on whether this can lead to something meaningful given the current situation.

Never been a pre workout consumer, I’ve always preferred drinking black coffee as pre workout and it works great for me. 

Tried this pre workout today, and honestly it’s not worth it. 

I took it about 30 mins before my workout, and the real effect started post workout. So I believe you should take your pre workout at least 1 hour before your workouts.

The effect lasted for about 8 hours, trust me. I felt very active after my workout, I felt alert, had better conversations with people, so I guess that was the caffeine in it that actually worked. 

Am not sure about the other ingredients in it, but I’ve heard pre workout can also give you a good pump, which didn’t happen. My pump was usual, nothing special.

Few months ago, I tried MuscleBlaze Pre Workout Extreme or something similar name, that thing had a really crazy effect, I believe it was stronger and more effective than this.

TLDR, if you can afford taking pre workout, I won’t recommend MB WRATHX. Spending the same money on a pre workout meal would be a wise choice. Pre workout supplements are not necessary, but I’d definitely recommend having black coffee before workouts.

1mlhstw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlhstw,Trains Through the Sand: How Railways Once United the Middle East The first Damascus–Beirut train,"#Trains Through the Sand: How Railways Once United the Middle East The first Damascus–Beirut train

The first train on the Damascus–Beirut route departed on August 3, 1895. Given the political, economic, and military implications of railway control, colonial powers like France and England fiercely competed to design the line.

Rayak station, opened the same year in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, was the largest Ottoman railway workshop in the Middle East. At its peak, it employed 2,500 workers, according to Elias Maalouf, author of Lebanon on Rail. During the rule of Bashar al-Assad, the station became a base for Syrian intelligence. ""Detainees were piled naked onto the carriages,"" Elias reports. Today, the yard is a forgotten world of rust, overgrown with fern and tall poplars, concealing dormant steam locomotives.

In the early 20th century, the Beirut–Damascus line became part of the Ottoman Hejaz Railway, which continued south through present-day Jordan to Medina.

Station along the Hejaz rail route (Aqaba Museum)-2

#The mythical railway line of the Hejaz

In Amman, the Ottoman railway station opened in 1919 and was built along the Hejaz line to connect the Arabian Peninsula with the Mediterranean, reducing travel time from 50 to just 5 days. The line largely followed the ancient pilgrimage route from Damascus to Mecca. Over time, its role shifted to a primarily military one. It held great political and religious value for the Ottoman Empire, symbolizing resistance to European interference.

Considered the most ambitious non-European project of the 19th century, the Hejaz Railway involved immense engineering challenges. Built mostly by the Turkish army, the narrow-gauge line (1050 mm) passed through desert landscapes of dunes and rocky valleys, requiring the construction of around 2,000 bridges and crossings. The project also faced frequent sabotage by Bedouins, who raided wooden railroad ties to use as firewood. Construction began in Damascus in 1900, and the first train reached Medina—1,322 kilometers away—on August 22, 1908.

During World War I, the line’s strategic importance made it a target. The Bedouin Revolt, supported by British officer Lawrence of Arabia, included attacks and sabotage that weakened the Ottoman hold on the region and helped pave the way for British and Arab forces to advance toward Damascus.

The dramatic train ambush featured in the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia, directed by David Lean and starring Peter O’Toole, is now re-enacted twice weekly by the Jordan Heritage Revival Company in the Wadi Rum desert for thousands of tourists. https://jhrc.jo/

#Wadi Rum station and the Japanese locomotive

In the heart of the Wadi Rum desert stands a station once used by Turkish army trains. There, a powerful Japanese steam locomotive still rests in the yard. But how did it get there?

(foto Giuseppe Colasanto)

The Japanese Emperor, aiming to strengthen ties with the German Empire, gifted the locomotive to Kaiser Wilhelm II. However, as European rail standards changed, the locomotive’s narrow-gauge design rendered it obsolete in Europe. Rather than scrapping it, Germany sent it to its ally, the Ottoman Empire, which put it to use on the Hejaz Railway.

#Railway lines as boundaries

After the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1919, a portion of the Orient Express route was used to mark the new border between Syria and Turkey—an arbitrary and unstable division imposed by the victorious powers of World War I. Once again, a railroad had redrawn Middle Eastern boundaries: “Control of communication routes, monopoly of trade, and eventually exploitation of oil fields were the dominant interests guiding European powers in shaping the new post-Ottoman territories—even before the Great War had ended.”

#The train: from symbol of modernity to synonym of backwardness

The downfall of trains began in the 1960s and 1970s, with the mass adoption of cars. Trains came to be seen as outdated. Their decline contributed to cities overwhelmed by traffic, pollution, and chaotic expansion.

Many Middle Eastern cities where I lived—with their Roman forums, ancient minarets, and cinnamon-scented souks—began to model themselves on the Gulf countries: straight, four- or six-lane roads. Today, if you say “downtown,” a taxi driver won’t take you to the old center—he’ll head straight for the new mall.

(foto Giuseppe Colasanto)

Symbols of the East’s charm, including its modes of travel, have changed. Urban development and the high real-estate value of railway properties did the rest, forever altering the region’s cityscapes.

#From 1961 until the outbreak of civil war, the Lebanese government didn’t add a single meter to the rail network. They just ran it—and then let it die,"" says Nabil J. Doumani, president of the NGO Train/Train. At the time, Beirut—one of the Middle East’s most prosperous and cosmopolitan cities—not only had an excellent rail system, but also a streetcar network, dismantled around 1965.

#Reversing the trend of land transportation by rail

Rail links are among the weakest infrastructure points on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. Currently, only 10 Arab countries (Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania) have rail lines, collectively covering a mere 25,000 kilometers—many of which are broken or inactive. But change may be underway. Environmental awareness, traffic-choked cities, and booming populations are prompting a reassessment.

Last year, the first high-speed tilting train left Riyadh and traveled 1,215 kilometers north to Qurayyat, near the Jordanian border. Across the Gulf States and Iran, governments are investing tens of billions to revive rail networks. By 2040, the current 25,000 kilometers could multiply dramatically.

(foto Giuseppe Colasanto)

Demand is soaring. China—leader in high-speed rail—seeks to connect Asia to Europe via the Middle East. German, French, and Italian consortia, including Italy’s luxury train company Arsenale with its five-star train, are entering the market. In Lebanon, Italy is helping through UNESCO’s “LiBeirut” initiative to restore Beirut’s historic 1894 train station in Mar Mikhael. “Redeveloping the station is another step in healing Beirut’s socio-economic and cultural fabric,” said Italy’s Ambassador to Lebanon, Nicoletta Bombardiere.

#What future?

Yet the future remains uncertain. “We can’t invest in anything if chaos continues,” says one disheartened Lebanese engineer. Reviving the trains has been delayed by poor budgets, war-torn governments, and political dysfunction. Local airlines resist losing profitable short-haul routes. And many train lines stop just shy of borders that remain impassable.

China’s dream of reaching the Levant is currently stuck—due to a missing 22-kilometer railway segment between Iran and Iraq.

#Turkish coffee

Now I am with Dr. Muayyad Abu Rumman, director of the Jordan Heritage Revival Company. He invites me to a traditional café in Amman, and we settle into wooden deck chairs under a vast lemon tree. The air is fragrant. We’re served kawha, Turkish coffee—rich, slow, and symbolic.

Turkish coffee is inherently convivial. Its slow rhythm wraps around you like history. A modus vivendi that belongs to the entire Middle East, it embodies the timeless spirit of a region where everything can remain unchanged—until, suddenly, it doesn't.

(foto Giuseppe Colasanto)

“The train,” Dr. Muayyad tells me, “has always been, and could still be, a platform for social connection. A functioning rail network would be an engine of sustainable development for the entire Middle East.”

He shares his dream: a historical tourist train to Ma’an station, and a video documentary in Italian to reactivate the flow of Italian visitors—cut off by war in neighboring countries.

Now, a gentle breeze clears the clouds. Over a lavender-blue Amman sky, flocks of birds soar high. The voice of the muezzin rises in prayer. And all the Levant, suspended in its millennia-old culture, seems to be asleep.

1mlhq3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/1mlhq3n/lessons_learned_confirmed_and_debunked_during_a/,"Lessons learned, confirmed and debunked during a two week Sierra trip without resupply","As trip reports seldom gain traction here I labeled these gear centric observations from the Sierra with the Skills flair.

On a recent no-resupply 14 day trip my TPW was 32.5 lbs  (31.5 according to the scale I keep in the trunk): 18 lbs of food, 2lbs for water, the rest gear and that 17” long bear canister.

u/irczer , myself and hardman Rich did 150 miles of which maybe 120 was off trail; crossed 25 passes and climbed one peak (Tunemah - notably the most remote summit in the range)

**Canister**: My Bearikade Blazer’s ten day capacity has worked, but lately I’ve been desiring to stay out longer. A call to Alan, the seventy+ year old owner and main assembly guy at Bearikade, resulted in me ordering a massive 17″ version, 2.5″ longer than an Expedition. At 1130g curiously it is still lighter than a BV500.

This capacity holds at least 45000 calories without tamping things down, which are two weeks plus for me.

**Food and fuel:** I had almost 2800 calories per day, weighing in at 560g. Never felt lack of energy, nor late trip hiker hunger. But I’m 62 and lean without much muscle mass. Everything tasted great, unlike the catastrophic menu on last year’s SoSHR!  

Meal plan: [https://imgur.com/Nb4W6CF](https://imgur.com/Nb4W6CF)  Ațe the same every day!

I brought a single 4 oz canister and used 60% of the content. My strategy was cold brew coffee twice a day, and merely heating my dinners to 50'ish degrees C. For this I used 3.5-4g of fuel per meal. I ended up caving in and having warm coffee on the three particularly frosty mornings we experienced. 

*With such low fuel reliance one could argue the switch to cold soaking would make sense. But besides being gross, cold soaking grains and legumes with oil and spices may not be as calorie efficient as simply eating a high fat nut mix instead for dinner: my homemade evening dish is about 4.5 cal/g; the yummy sweet salty nut/seed/chocolate blend I create is 7.5 cal/g.*

**Electronics:** The big 10K Anker kept the watch, lamp and phone running for two weeks. I didn’t let the phone drop below 20% and never charged to above 80%. Hour to hour navigation, several hundred pics, many short video clips and daily satellite texting were the power draws. 

Phone type and the battery health are also factors to consider when sizing a power bank. I received a new 16e before the trip - with the old phone I would have needed far more than 20K for this long.

**Shelter:** In the Sierra I have no need for a floor nor a net inner, and most definitely not a bivy bag, but see tremendous value in a windproof and draft free setup with bug protection. Thus the simple 13oz Khufu mid with DIY peri-netting is pretty ideal.

I don’t mind setting up on wet ground, and the well draining soils of the High Sierra (mostly decomposed granite, aka DG) are forgiving in a downpour. Site selection is always important and hitting it right comes with experience. In the fight against condensation we always loose, so once I’ve done what I can I just shrug it off.

**Sleep:** The shelter is part of this, and the low, sealed pitch adds enough warmth that a bag with a mere 7.5 ounces of down works good enough for the generally mild conditions of Sierra summers (over the span of 12 seasons and hundreds of nights I have always used something rated around 40°F comfort). 

A thin self inflatable torso sized Thermarest of unknown R-value from the last millennium for me represents the pinnacle of backcountry comfort. But with a floorless shelter an also torso sized Thinlite goes on the ground first, while the pack ‘cushions’ the feet.

Always sleep good, but occasionally in the early morning during a cold spell I line the bag with a VBL that also doubles as my pack liner during the day, and the instant boost of warmth sends me back to REM so fast. 

Cowboy camping runs the risk of heavy dew settling on the bag from sunset onwards, especially when mostly the lake basins offer any decent camping in remote higher locations. As I use a thin bag without much buffer I rarely bother.

**Clothing:** Alpha Direct and 7d based garments are FKT stuff imo. With that I mean occasional use for very special trips only. Alpha sheds, thins and rips readily. Besides environmental impacts the degradation lowers the performance faster than any other base layer I’ve owned. 7d nylon is weakly calendared so leaks down sooner and holes form without known impacts. Also at a sieve-like 56 cfm I often missed the real wind breaking of my current gen Houdini. 

The experiment of going 14 days with a bear canister probably justified Alpha/7d use here, but normally I pack merino and 10d.

**Trekking poles:** Contrary to common advice, for me the BD Carbon-Z’s are plenty strong for sustained off-trail hiking and at my age I frequently lean on them heavily especially downhill. I’m a sworn no-leash user and the grips on the Z’s are as if made for that. Broken one in 8 years of use.

**Pack:** I carried a lightly modded frameless Bears Ears for the tremendous benefit of a low center of gravity and snug, wiggle free fit for the miles of talus and scrambling.

Also being able to haul a canister several inches longer than a Bearikade Expedition on a pack weighing only 760g is dope. 

**Hipbelt pockets:** Even the best designed ones are annoying to me for more reasons than I care to relate. Long inseam cargo shorts FTW! I store Aqua Mira, DEET, sunscreen, soap, SAK and sunglasses here. I don’t eat on the go, so snacks are in the pack’s front pocket. 

A low profile zippered shoulder strap pocket holds the phone and cheap readers with the temples replaced by shockcord hang around my neck all day.

**Water:** A banner subject for me as I designed the Bears Ears pack to specifically not have the dreaded water bottle side pockets but instead puts them on the hipbelt way back, yet super accessible and secure. Unlike hipbelt pockets these bottle holders are absolutely clutch

**Pencil:** Writing trip notes and thoughts on the back of my Tom Harrison maps is a great wind down when sitting in the tent after sunset. I always look forward to this moment.

1mlhkrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NiteFiles/comments/1mlhkrd/you_let_them_in/,You Let Them In,"Chapter 1 – The Garage Sale

It was one of those Fridays where the air felt thick and heavy, like the weekend couldn’t get here fast enough. Ahmad trudged down the sidewalk, his backpack slung over one shoulder, work badge still clipped to his shirt. His feet ached from standing all day, and all he wanted was a shower, a meal, and maybe an hour to himself before bed.

That’s when he saw it — a folding table at the edge of a cracked driveway, stacked with old electronics, tangled cords, and faded cardboard boxes. A handwritten sign hung crookedly off a lawn chair:

GARAGE SALE – CASH ONLY

An old man sat behind the table, hunched and still, his face shadowed by a wide-brimmed hat. His skin looked paper-thin, almost grey in the fading sunlight. Ahmad was about to keep walking until his eyes caught on a black game case near the end of the table. No title on the cover — just a matte finish with the faint outline of an apartment building embossed into the plastic.

Something about it drew him in.

“How much for this?” Ahmad asked, picking it up.

The old man’s lips curled into a small, dry smile. “Five dollars,” he said, voice rasping like sandpaper. “But you play it… alone. Always alone.”

Ahmad chuckled nervously. “Alright, man. It’s just a game.” He pulled out a crumpled bill and handed it over.

The old man’s hand lingered on the case before letting go. “It’ll know you,” he murmured.

Ahmad didn’t even reply. He was too tired to deal with cryptic weirdness. He stuffed the game into his backpack and headed toward his apartment building — a worn, three-story brick structure at the end of the block. The flickering hallway lights welcomed him like they always did.

His neighbors were already making noise — someone’s TV blaring upstairs, a couple in the next apartment yelling about rent money, and the thud of footsteps above his head.

Normal. Annoying. Comfortably predictable.

That night, after a microwaved dinner and a quick shower, Ahmad slid the mysterious disc into his console. The title screen flickered to life — no music, just the sound of faint breathing through his speakers. The menu had only one option:

PLAY




Chapter 2 – First Playthrough

The game started in total darkness. No cutscenes. No backstory. Just Ahmad’s controller vibrating lightly in his hands while the sound of slow footsteps echoed in his headphones.

A single light bulb buzzed overhead in the game, revealing the setting: a three-story apartment building with chipped paint, faded carpeting, and flickering hallway lights. Ahmad froze for a second.

It looked… exactly like his own apartment building.

Not just similar — identical. The cracks in the wall, the dented elevator door, even the crooked fire extinguisher bracket on the first floor.

“Alright, that’s creepy,” he muttered, smirking but feeling his skin tighten.

He moved the character forward, wandering the halls. The game didn’t have a HUD, no health bar, no map — just a first-person perspective. Every so often, a faint shadow would dart at the end of a hallway, just outside the edge of the light.

The character — him — entered his apartment in the game. The furniture was the same. His couch. His crooked coffee table. Even the half-empty soda can he’d left on the counter that morning.

His stomach twisted a little, but he told himself it was just a wild coincidence.

On the screen, the front door rattled like someone was trying to get in. The sound wasn’t muffled through the game — it was sharp and loud, like it was in the room with him. Ahmad turned his head toward his real door, heart beating faster.

Nothing.

Back in the game, the door burst open. A figure stepped inside — tall, wearing a tattered hoodie, face hidden in shadow. It didn’t move like a normal game character. The jerky, uneven steps felt… wrong. Like real human movement captured badly.

The figure stood there for a moment, head tilting like it was watching him.

Then the screen went black.

A soft knock came from his real door.

Ahmad froze. The controller hung in his hand, slick with sweat. The knock came again — slower this time, deliberate.

He stood up quietly, peered through the peephole. Nobody there.

“Hell no,” he whispered, locking the deadbolt and backing away.

When he sat back down, the game had restarted him in the hallway — but now, there was a new message scrawled in red letters across the wall in-game:

YOU LET THEM IN.



Chapter 3 – First Realization

Ahmad’s skin prickled as he stared at the red letters.

He made his character walk down the hallway. Every door he passed in the game matched a real neighbor’s apartment. The game’s sound design was unsettling — faint breathing, a wet shuffling noise, and sometimes a muffled laugh that didn’t feel like it belonged in the background.

He stopped outside an apartment door in the game. It was the same door as his neighbor Mrs. Carter’s in real life — the cranky older woman who always yelled at him about leaving his trash bag outside his door “for even one second.”

The game offered a single on-screen prompt:

PRESS X TO KNOCK.

He hesitated. His thumb hovered over the button.

“Alright, whatever,” he muttered, pressing X.

In the game, the character knocked three times.

In real life, he heard the knocks echo from the hallway. The exact rhythm.

Ahmad ripped off his headphones, staring at the TV.

From outside, Mrs. Carter’s voice came sharp and annoyed. “Who’s out there?!”

He froze. He didn’t knock. Not really.

Slowly, he moved the character away from her door in-game. The next apartment down was Mr. Gaines’ — a dude in his thirties who blasted music at all hours. Same in the game. The prompt appeared again:

PRESS X TO OPEN.

Ahmad shook his head. “Nah, I’m not messing with that.”

The controller vibrated violently in his hands. The screen flickered. Without pressing anything, his character reached for the doorknob in the game.

On-screen, the door opened to reveal the inside of Gaines’ apartment. The lights were off, and the only illumination came from a TV playing static. A figure sat on the couch — hunched forward, breathing heavily.

The camera angle in the game moved closer on its own.

The figure turned toward the screen. Its face was covered in fresh, wet gashes, the skin around the mouth hanging loose like it had been cut open.

Ahmad jerked the controller, but the game didn’t respond.

Then, from the real hallway, came the sound of something heavy hitting the floor.

He scrambled to the window. From his apartment, he could see through the gap in Gaines’ curtains. The TV in there was really on, flashing static. Something — someone — was lying face down on the carpet.

Ahmad’s pulse pounded in his ears. He turned back to the TV. The in-game figure was still staring directly at him.

Across the screen, in dripping red text, appeared the words:

YOU’RE NEXT.





⸻

Chapter 4 – First Kill

Ahmad’s hands were shaking as he set the controller down. He didn’t want to play anymore. Hell, he didn’t even want to look at the TV — but the game didn’t pause when he put the controller down.

In-game, his character was standing in the stairwell between the second and third floors. The air was dim and hazy, as if the walls themselves were breathing.

From somewhere below, footsteps began — slow, deliberate, heavy boots thudding against the old wood.

Thud… thud… thud.

The sound was too clear, too real. Ahmad’s stomach twisted when he realized it wasn’t coming from the TV speakers anymore. It was coming from the actual stairwell outside his apartment.

His mind screamed don’t open the door.

But on-screen, his character turned the corner of the stairwell and looked down.

The killer was there.

Tall. Broad shoulders under a soaked, dark hoodie. His skin was the color of raw meat — shredded in places like something had peeled it back with fingers. His mouth was stuck in a permanent half-smile because half the skin around it was gone, exposing jagged teeth under pale gums.

The killer’s head snapped up in the game — and Ahmad swore, swore the eyes locked with his, not the character’s.

Then everything sped up. The killer bounded up the stairs in the game — and the real stairwell outside Ahmad’s door shook with heavy running steps.

BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

Somebody screamed down the hall. A door slammed.

Ahmad backed away from his front door just as the pounding shifted to his upstairs neighbor’s apartment. Mrs. Carter’s shrill voice echoed through the ceiling: “Get out! Get the hell out of here!”

Then — a sickening, wet crack.

In the game, the killer grabbed Mrs. Carter by the back of her neck, slamming her face into the wall so hard the plaster cracked. Blood splattered across the hallway wallpaper.

From above, Ahmad heard the real thud of a body hitting the floorboards.

The killer didn’t stop. In the game, he straddled her body and began stabbing — over and over — with something long and rusted, each thrust sending dark blood spraying in sharp bursts. The camera flickered in and out of focus, as if it couldn’t keep up with the speed of the attack.

From upstairs, the sounds matched perfectly — wet, tearing stabs, muffled gargles, then silence.

Then the game camera shifted. It wasn’t Ahmad’s point of view anymore.

It was the killer’s.

Breathing heavy, staring down at the torn mess of Mrs. Carter’s face. Bone glistened under shredded skin, one of her eyes hanging loose by a thin cord of muscle.

The killer’s gaze turned toward the stairwell — toward Ahmad’s apartment.

In real life, the sound of slow, heavy boots began again, descending the stairs one step at a time.

Thud… thud… thud.

They were coming for him.





Chapter 5 – Hiding

Ahmad’s pulse was hammering in his ears. The killer’s footsteps were slow now, deliberate, as if savoring the walk down to his floor.

He snatched the remote and killed the TV screen, plunging the room into darkness. The apartment felt too small suddenly — every creak of the floor, every sound from the old pipes amplified until it felt like the walls themselves were whispering.

Thud…
One step closer.

He backed into his bedroom, shutting the door as quietly as he could. His window overlooked the alley, but it was a three-story drop. No fire escape.

From somewhere beyond the door came a dragging sound — like something sharp was scraping along the wall.

Ahmad crouched beside his bed, breathing shallow, listening.

In the hallway, the footsteps stopped. Silence. Then — three slow knocks on his apartment door.

His phone buzzed suddenly, loud in the quiet. He grabbed it, silencing it instantly, but not before he saw the text.

UNKNOWN: Open up, Ahmad.

His stomach lurched. How did they know his name?

He crawled under the bed, pressing himself flat against the dust and old boxes. His heart thumped so hard it hurt.

The killer’s boots finally stepped inside the apartment. He could hear the faint leather creak with each movement.

In the living room, something fell over — maybe his chair. The boots moved toward the kitchen. A cabinet door slammed. The fridge door opened, then closed.

Then the footsteps shifted toward the bedroom.

Ahmad’s throat went dry. He could see the faint shadow of movement under the door crack, stretching toward him like it knew exactly where he was.

The doorknob rattled once… then stopped.

Silence.

Ahmad almost believed they’d left when the door slowly creaked open.

The killer stepped inside — heavy breathing filling the room. Ahmad could see the dark silhouette of his legs from under the bed. They stopped just a foot away.

A drop of something wet hit the floor. Blood. It spread across the hardwood in a small pool.

Then, without warning, the killer crouched low. Ahmad could see part of the face now — shredded skin, teeth showing through a permanent grin, eyes so pale they almost glowed in the dark.

They looked straight under the bed.

Ahmad clamped a hand over his mouth, every muscle locked.

The killer’s head tilted, like he was studying him. Then… a slow, horrible smile.

And just as suddenly — he stood up and walked out of the room.

The front door slammed shut.

Ahmad stayed frozen under the bed for a long time, afraid that moving would bring him back.

When he finally crawled out, the apartment was empty… except for the game controller sitting in the middle of the floor.

It was on. The TV was back on too, showing his character standing alone in the hallway.

And down the hallway, in the game, the killer was walking away.

But he knew it was only for now.






⸻

Chapter 6 – The Chase

Ahmad didn’t even remember standing up. One second he was staring at the controller, the next he was grabbing his jacket and bolting for the door.

He wasn’t staying here.

The hallway outside reeked of something metallic — the smell of blood so thick it almost burned his throat. Mrs. Carter’s door upstairs was wide open. A dark, wet smear trailed down the steps.

From the TV inside his apartment, the sound of heavy breathing spilled into the hall. Ahmad glanced back — the game had switched views again.

The killer’s POV.

Walking toward the very hallway Ahmad was standing in.

He swore under his breath and ran.

His sneakers slapped against the warped floorboards as he tore down the stairs. On the second floor, he passed Mr. Gaines’ apartment — the door hanging off its hinges, the inside trashed. Something in the dark twitched, but Ahmad didn’t stop to see what.

Behind him came the sound — BOOM, BOOM, BOOM — the killer’s boots hitting the steps hard, gaining fast.

He cut down the hallway toward the back stairwell, pushing past a stack of laundry baskets some neighbor had left out. He hit the door hard, shoving it open — and froze.

In the stairwell below, the killer was already there.

Ahmad’s stomach dropped.

The killer tilted his head up slowly, locking those pale, milky eyes on him. A slow smile spread across that shredded face. Then he moved — fast.

Ahmad spun back into the hallway and sprinted toward the front stairs. He could hear the killer now on both sides — boots thundering above and below, the sound echoing unnaturally like there was more than one of him.

A door to his left cracked open — his downstairs neighbor, Mark, poked his head out, looking confused. “Yo, what the hell is—”

Before Ahmad could warn him, the killer exploded from the shadows of the stairwell, grabbing Mark by the throat.

Ahmad kept running, but the sound followed him — a sickening crunch as the killer’s fingers closed like a vice, crushing Mark’s windpipe. Blood sprayed against the hallway wall.

He hit the front stairwell, leaping down two steps at a time. Halfway down, he heard it again — that guttural breathing, right behind him now.

He burst through the front door into the night air, the flickering streetlight barely cutting through the darkness. He sprinted toward the alley, lungs burning, feet pounding.

In the corner of his eye, movement — the killer, already stepping out from behind a dumpster ahead of him.

It didn’t make sense. He’d been behind him seconds ago.

Ahmad skidded to a stop, heart pounding. The killer stepped into the light, rusted blade in hand, blood dripping from the tip.

And then — every streetlight on the block went out at once.

Darkness swallowed everything.





Chapter 7 – Blood in the Dark

The darkness was suffocating. Ahmad’s breathing echoed in his own ears as he stumbled backward, trying to keep distance from where he’d last seen the killer.

Somewhere ahead, a wet scraping noise started — metal dragging along brick.

Shhhhk… shhhhk… shhhhk…

Then, without warning, a scream tore through the night — high-pitched, raw, and close.

Ahmad’s eyes darted toward the sound. The faintest bit of light spilled from a second-story window where one of his neighbors, Danielle, was leaning out, shouting for help.

The killer’s silhouette appeared right behind her.

Ahmad froze, helpless, as the figure grabbed Danielle by her hair and yanked her backward into the apartment. Her scream cut off in a choked gasp.

Then the sound started — blunt impacts, wet and deep. Each one accompanied by a dull thud as her body convulsed against the window frame.

A pale arm hung limp over the sill for a moment before sliding out of sight.

The killer reappeared at the window, looking down at Ahmad. That grin — torn lips stretched over teeth — never changed.

And then the bastard dropped something.

Danielle’s head hit the pavement two feet away from Ahmad with a sickening crack, rolling once before stopping face-up, eyes glassy, mouth open mid-scream. Her hair was still wet with fresh blood.

Ahmad stumbled back, bile rising in his throat.

From above, the killer vaulted out the window, landing in a crouch next to the headless body now lying half-in, half-out of the apartment window. The impact made a sound like a meat sack hitting the floor.

The killer straightened slowly, blade in one hand, Danielle’s blood smeared across his hoodie.

Ahmad turned and ran. His sneakers splashed through something warm and sticky — a trail of blood he didn’t want to think about.

Behind him, the killer’s footsteps exploded into motion, pounding against the pavement, closing in.

He dove into the side entrance of the building, slamming the door shut and throwing the deadbolt. His hands shook so bad he could barely hold the lock in place.

Silence.

Then, a slow knock on the other side of the door.

Three knocks.

The same rhythm from the game.





⸻

Chapter 8 – The Hunt

The knocks stopped.

Ahmad’s chest rose and fell in sharp bursts, each breath sounding too loud. The door between them was thin, the wood old. If the killer wanted in, it wouldn’t hold for long.

Then he heard it — tap… tap… tap… — light footsteps moving away down the hall.

Silence.

He almost believed the killer had left, until the building’s old pipes rattled above him. Then, a muffled thud from the floor above.

They were inside again.

Ahmad backed into the stairwell, trying to keep quiet, but the old wooden steps betrayed him with every move. He crept upward to the second floor. The hallway was dim, lit only by a buzzing overhead light that swung slightly, casting sick shadows along the walls.

Halfway down the hall, something wet dripped from the ceiling. It landed on his hand — warm, sticky.

He looked up.

Blood was seeping through the cracks between the floorboards above, dripping in slow, fat drops. The overhead light swung harder now, as if someone was pacing back and forth upstairs.

A door behind him creaked open.

Ahmad spun, pressing his back to the wall. It was apartment 2B — Mrs. Carter’s place. The door swung wider, the inside swallowed in darkness.

From the shadows inside, something shifted. A pale hand — fingers stiff, bent at wrong angles — slid out along the floorboards, dragging itself forward.

Ahmad choked back a sound and bolted for the stairs.

As soon as his foot hit the first step, the lights on every floor went out at once.

Now, only the faint red glow from the EXIT sign at the far end of the hall lit the space — and in that glow, Ahmad saw him.

The killer stood at the other end of the hallway, blade dangling loosely at his side, head tilted. He began walking forward — slow at first, then faster.

Ahmad turned and ran up the stairs to the third floor. He could hear the killer’s boots on the steps behind him, the sound echoing off the walls like there were more of him coming from every direction.

The third floor was worse — doors hung open, apartments ransacked, streaks of blood smeared across the walls in frantic handprints. In one doorway, a man’s body hung half in, half out, his chest split open and ribcage pried apart like some grotesque display.

The killer’s shadow stretched long against the wall behind Ahmad.

He darted into an open apartment and slammed the door shut. His eyes scanned the room — there, in the corner, a small coat closet.

He slipped inside, pulling the door closed until only a thin strip of light cut through.

Footsteps entered the apartment.

Slow.

Measured.

The blade scraped along the walls, dragging through the wallpaper.

Ahmad pressed a hand over his mouth, trying not to breathe too loud.

The steps stopped right outside the closet.

Silence.

Then — the doorknob began to turn.





Chapter 9 – Neighbors’ Massacre

The closet door cracked open an inch.

Ahmad didn’t breathe.

The killer’s pale, torn face appeared in that sliver of light, one milky eye locking with his. The grin widened — slow, deliberate.

Then, without warning, the killer let the door go… and walked away.

Ahmad stayed still, confused and terrified, until the sound hit him.

Screams.

Multiple voices at once.

He pushed the door open just enough to see the hallway through the apartment’s open door. The killer wasn’t looking for him anymore — he’d moved to the far end of the floor, where the Ramirez family’s apartment was.

The first to run out was Mr. Ramirez, clutching his arm — or what was left of it. Blood sprayed in a high arc from the stump where his forearm used to be. He tripped over his own feet, slamming into the wall. The killer followed him out, swinging his blade in a wide arc.

The rusted steel sank deep into Mr. Ramirez’s side. Ahmad heard the wet shlkk as the killer yanked it out, spilling loops of intestine onto the floor like someone had dumped a bag of meat.

Mrs. Ramirez screamed, trying to pull her kids out of the apartment, but the killer moved faster. He grabbed her by the mouth, fingers digging into her cheeks so deep they tore, and slammed her head into the doorframe until the bone gave way with a crack.

The kids ran. One made it to the stairwell — the other didn’t. The killer’s blade went clean through the boy’s chest, lifting him off the ground for a second before dropping him in a twitching heap.

Blood painted the walls.

Ahmad’s body trembled so hard his knees nearly gave. He wanted to run, but every exit was in the killer’s sightline.

Down below, more screams erupted — the killer had moved again, impossibly fast, now tearing through the second floor. Ahmad could hear doors slamming, furniture overturning, the thud of bodies hitting walls.

He crept out of the apartment, keeping low, moving toward the fire escape window at the end of the hall.

Then — a head came flying out of one of the second-floor windows, hitting the pavement outside with a dull thump.

Ahmad swallowed bile and kept moving.

By the time he reached the fire escape, the building was nearly silent again, except for the faint drip… drip… drip of blood hitting the floorboards.

But silence was worse. It meant the killer was between him and the exit.





⸻

Chapter 10 – Ahmad’s Last Stand

Ahmad gripped the rusted railing of the fire escape, peering down into the alley. Three stories wasn’t a drop he could survive. His only way out was down through the building — and that meant going right back toward the killer.

From somewhere inside came the faint creak of a floorboard. Slow. Purposeful.

He looked at the window beside him — a storage closet, mostly empty except for a mop bucket and a broken chair.

He climbed in. His eyes scanned the floor until they locked on the chair leg — thick wood, splintered at the end. He gripped it tight. It wasn’t much, but it was better than nothing.

Boots hit the floor just outside the door.

Ahmad backed into the corner, weapon raised.

The door opened.

The killer stepped inside, ducking under the frame. Up close, Ahmad could see the skin around his jaw hanging in strips, teeth always bared in that torn smile. His hoodie was soaked dark red, the fabric sticking to him in places.

They stared at each other for one long second.

Then the killer lunged.

Ahmad swung the chair leg as hard as he could, catching the side of that ruined face. The killer’s head snapped to the side, but he barely staggered. He grabbed Ahmad by the throat and slammed him into the wall, the wood cracking behind him.

Black spots danced in Ahmad’s vision as the killer raised his blade.

Pure instinct took over. Ahmad jammed the splintered end of the chair leg up into the killer’s side. The sound was awful — a thick, wet pop followed by a rush of warmth down Ahmad’s hands.

The killer grunted — not in pain, more in surprise.

Ahmad twisted the wood deeper. Blood bubbled from the killer’s mouth.

With a roar, the killer yanked Ahmad off the wall and threw him across the room. Ahmad hit the floor hard, rolling until his hand smacked against something cold — the mop bucket. Inside, a long metal mop handle.

He grabbed it, spinning just as the killer came at him again. Ahmad drove the end of the handle straight through the killer’s neck. It punched out the other side in a spray of hot blood.

The killer dropped the blade, clawing at the metal jutting from his throat.

Ahmad didn’t stop. He shoved him backward, slamming him into the wall. The killer gurgled, blood pouring down his chest, his pale eyes still locked on Ahmad’s.

Finally, his legs gave out. He slid to the floor, the mop handle still buried in his neck, blood pooling around him.

Ahmad stumbled back, chest heaving, every muscle screaming.

Silence.

He looked down. The killer wasn’t moving. The torn smile was still frozen in place, but the light in his eyes had gone.

Ahmad let out a shaky laugh — half relief, half madness. He dropped the chair leg and stepped toward the door.

Then… from the hallway…

Thud… thud… thud.

Slow, heavy footsteps, getting closer.

1mlhibt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1mlhibt/my_friend_keeps_scheduling_girls_days_then_brings/,My friend keeps scheduling girls days then brings her boyfriend,"Okay some backstory. I (32F) have two close friends who we’ll call Rachel (31F) and Alyssa (29F). Alyssa and I have only been friends for about four years but both of us have known Rachel for over a decade. We’re sort of a trio. Live in the same general area, have a group chat with the three of us and another group chat with some of our other friends, play video games with each other at least once a week, and try to meet up for coffee like once or twice a month, etc. We haven’t met up as often the last three months with it being summer because of our schedules just being too hectic but we’ve still been texting almost every day. 

Alyssa has been having a bit of hard time with her mental health though due to some family stuff, some health scares, and some work drama. Because of this, Rachel and I have been as supportive as we can be and try to be available as much as possible when she needs someone to talk to. Though I will admit that sometimes Alyssa can have a very negative outlook on things and spirals really hard. When she gets like that it’s hard for me to deal with multiple times a week without my own mental health being dragged. I am not a professional, but I think Alyssa realistically needs a good therapist and potentially some anti-depressants. We’ve kinda gently suggested it to her and she’s mostly seemed uninterested in the idea. 

Anyways, onto the problem at hand. About a month ago, Alyssa invited us to a girls coffee date thing. Basically just grab coffee, maybe do a bit of window shopping, catch up, etc. The day and time she wanted to go was kinda inconvenient for Rachel and I but we both moved things around to make it work because we knew Alyssa was struggling. Well cue our surprise when we show up and her boyfriend (30M) is also there. She’s been dating him for about three years but I’ve only met him a handful of times because he lives an hour away. They only see each other on weekends usually because of the distance. So because of that, Alyssa normally only schedules our hang outs when he’s not over or when he’s got other plans going on. So back to the coffee date…it was a little awkward at first since neither Rachel or I were expecting him to be there but after the initial few minutes it turned into a semi-normal hang out. He ended up leaving maybe 20min before Rachel and I did and, after he was gone, we kinda expressed our surprise at seeing her bf there. Alyssa seemed confused about why we didn’t expect him and just said that while she knew it was girls day, she’d wanted to spend more time with him that weekend since she’d been having a rough week and figured we wouldn’t mind if she ended up being him along. A bit weird but understandable I guess?

Well now it’s happened again. Sorta. Last week, Alyssa reached out asking for us to meet up tomorrow for some girl time coffee date stuff. Like specifically called it girl time in the text. Rachel said she had plans already that day but said we were obviously welcome to meet up without her. I already had plans in the afternoon but it had been one of those weeks where Alyssa was kinda spiraling so I felt bad also turning down the plans. I agreed to meet if we could do it midmorning instead so I wouldn’t be late to my afternoon plans. Alyssa agreed and I thought that was that. Then a few days ago, Rachel said her plans had been rescheduled to the following so she would be able to come after all. Alyssa seemed happy about it and we made some more plans about what we’d do after getting coffee and etc. Then earlier today, Alyssa texted again to ask if we were still on. Rachel and I were both at work and didn’t respond until later, but both of us said we’d still be there. Alyssa confirmed the time and meet up spot and again I thought that was that. 

Then, just before this post (so almost midnight), Alyssa sent another text saying her bf wanted to come too so she’d be bringing him tomorrow now as well. Rachel immediately sent me a private text asking like what I thought about it and we both agreed it’s weird and kinda annoying. Like I said, we don’t dislike him but we don’t necessarily want to spend “girl time” with him either. I dunno. It’s just weird. Rachel now wants to reschedule because she had a really rough week at work and I’m dealing with a chronic pain flare up. We were both originally going to push through all that for a girls day/morning. But now that it’s no longer a girls day, neither of us are sure we really want to force a meet up tomorrow. We both agreed to sleep on it before saying anything to Alyssa but if we do decide to back out, we’re worried she’ll going into one of her negative depressive mindsets again. I know that sounds dramatic but lately the smallest things set her off. Even one of our other friends who isn’t as close mentioned that they thought we all might need to kinda keep an eye on her and support her because of how dark Alyssa gets sometimes. 

Regardless of the outcome of tomorrow’s situation, how do we approach this topic with Alyssa in the future? Like I want to be gentle and not accusatory. If there is some weirdness happening with her bf I don’t want to come across accusatory and scare her off. But if it’s not that, then we want her to understand she can’t keep planning girls only events only to end up bringing her bf without telling us or waiting until last minute to tell us.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KT Wiz vs. Samsung Lions: A Tale of Roars and Magic**  
*August 9, 2025 – KBO Action Packed with Odds, Laughs, and Zero Actual Dragons*

**Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Real MVP?**  
Let’s cut to the chase: the **KT Wiz** are the favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.65 to 1.71** (implying a **58–60% chance to win**). The **Samsung Lions**, meanwhile, sit at **2.14 to 2.2** (a **47–49% chance**), which is about as enticing to bet on as a fire alarm at a bakery. The spread tells an even clearer story: KT is -1.5 with odds of \~2.35, meaning bookmakers expect them to win by more than a run and a half. If you’re banking on Samsung (+1.5), it’s a lower-risk play but about as thrilling as watching a spreadsheet update itself.

The totals? A lukewarm “meh” of 8.5 to 9 runs, with the **Under priced slightly higher** (1.8–1.95) than the Over. Translation: This won’t be a slugfest. Expect a pitcher’s duel where the real drama is whether the Samsung closer can avoid turning the game into a spreadsheet error.

**Digesting the News: Are These Teams on Steroids or Just Coffee?**  
Recent headlines mention Taoyuan’s mayor hyping up a **Taiwan-Japan-Korea baseball exchange** in November, featuring the Rakuten Monkeys, Seibu Lions, and KT Wiz. But here’s the catch: this game in August? It’s a **KBO rivalry** between the Samsung Lions and KT Wiz. The future event is like a trailer for a movie that doesn’t affect tonight’s screening.

No major injuries or trades have been reported for either team. Samsung’s roster remains as sturdy as a Samsung smartphone (let’s hope), while KT’s “Wiz” branding is as mystical as a magician’s rabbit—el

This can't be normal, can it?","So I've been ordering breakfast from Wendy's for a good while now these past couple of months out of nowhere. Don't know why, just got the urge one day, ha. Anyway, I've been using their mobile app and usually use their offer of a reduced price for a breakfast meal deal, but there must've been some sort of glitch in the app because I initially just wanted a $1 any size drink, but when I clicked on the offer, it said offer redeemed but then the app closed ""due to an unknown error."" Go back in the app, coffee is still in my bag, but offer isn't applied. Figure, what the hell, I'll pay the extra for it and get the reduced price breakfast meal deal offer instead. In the past when I used to order from the Golden Arches, I'd always get an extra biscuit or plain English muffin to enjoy with some butter and jam. So, today I add two single honey butter biscuit along with my French toast sticks meal, as well as a sausage and cheese English muffin sandwich, and soon go to the drive thru to pick up. Pick up my order, thank them, only to realize a block away that they gave me a regular soda fountain drink inside of a coffee cup. Why, I have no idea, and pull over to check my bag.

Instead of what I ordered, I got a chicken biscuit and 4 piece french toast (I ordered 6 piece). No English muffin, no honey butter biscuit, and no black coffee. So I go back to the drive thru and explain I just came through here and didn't get my correct order. Discussed about the name on the order, what I actually wanted, and told to pull up to the window. So I do, and they hand me two bags and apologize for the mistake, and they've ""added something extra,"" as well as offering a small frosty as an apology. I declined the frosty (crucify me if you will, I accept my fate), and pull away this time into the parking lot before driving off to check my order again.

This time, they gave me a large black coffee (I only wanted a small), two honey butter biscuits, three chicken biscuits, two sausage and cheese English muffin sandwiches, a 6 piece french toast sticks, two chocolate chip cookies, an oatmeal bar, and small seasoned potatoes. I'm thinking, ""holy hell, jackpot!"" but at the same time, I was more confused than anything, and also a bit concerned as to why they've gone to this length. The worker at the window was apologizing profusely and seemed almost frightened at the fact that my order was wrong, and quite a bit pushy to give me the free frosty as well, which is why I declined because I felt like I'd be taking advantage of a simple mistake. I went back through the drive thru and directly up to the window, and explained again that I was just through here but that if they're sure they gave me the right order. Same worker reassured me that yes, everything is okay, and that the ""little extras"" was an apology for having to come back. So, with no choice but to accept, I just drove back home. After all, I don't think they'd even be able to take back the food. But I mean, c'mon, an order this big for a simple breakfast mistake?

The espresso is always made well and never sour. I used to go to West Oak, but lately every time I go there the espresso is wayy under-extracted. Many of the drinks I’ve gotten from West Oak lately have been sour and acrid. I’ve been going to Record for a while now, and while their space is much smaller and not as well decorated, the coffee is infinitely superior. The snacks they offer are lovely, too. I bought a bag of whole beans from them once, and they offered to grind the bag for me since I didn’t have my own coffee grinder. They share a space with a bike shop, and it’s really cool to see all the different bikes they are working on. Even while they are actively working on bikes, they are never uncomfortably noisy and don’t disrupt the atmosphere of the coffee shop. Their matcha is really good as well. I almost never go for matcha in general because it’s usually just not very good, but Record’s is bold and flavorful. Another thing which Record beats West Oak at is standing room. If Record is busy and there’s no seating, there is plenty of room for you to stand and wait for your drink without being in the way. West Oak is pretty much always full, and there is not really any space for you to stand and wait without causing a disruption if you can’t find a place to sit. If you are looking for actually good coffee, the people at Record know what they are doing. I highly recommend going if you haven’t tried it yet. One thing to note is that Record isn’t really the kind of coffee shop you can sit and do work in. They have limited seating so don’t expect to be spending an hour doing homework in there or something like that.",2,1754715355.0,Denton,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Felix Auger-Aliassime vs. Tomás Etcheverry: A Tale of Two Tenors (But One Is a Tennis Player)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a match that’s basically a Netflix drama where the underdog (Etcheverry, +175) thinks he’s *Moneyball* and the favorite (Auger-Aliassime, -225) is just here to collect his paycheck. Let’s break it down with the precision of a line judge and the humor of a stadium DJ on a Monday.

### The Numbers Game

* **Auger-Aliassime’s Implied Probability**: At decimal odds of \~1.4 (equivalent to -360 in American), the books think he’s got a **71% chance** to win. That’s like saying your morning coffee has a 71% chance of surviving your commute.
* **Etcheverry’s Implied Probability**: At +250 (decimal \~2.8), his 35% chance is about as likely as your significant other remembering to take out the trash. But hey, he just came back from a *three-hour rain-delayed comeback* against Juncheng Shang. He’s got the heart of a phoenix… or a man who’s finally found his lost socks.

### Spreads & Totals: The Real Drama

* **Spread**: Auger-Aliassime is -2.5 to -3.5 games across books. If you’re betting the spread, you’re basical

It went downhill about 2 months ago. Long story short, her partner wasn't comfortable sitting with out her, even though he knew one other person on the table (I had put him next to said person, and she knew this). She asked if he could join the table. We have two tables, one for friends and one for family/bridal party. I told her that I wouldn't move him to our table (I don't know him well at all, not even his last name, it was more a courtesy invite TBH), however to keep the peace I told her I'd move her and the other bridesmaid to him instead. Things blew up because she still wanted to sit with me. I told her that it wasn't an option and I gave a compromise to keep the peace and it would also avoid her having to pick whether to stay at the table with me, or sit with him. I expressed at that point that I was disappointed she even asked, and eventually I said to her I think it is best for you not to be a bridesmaid, that way she can enjoy the day with her partner more freely. There was some back and forth where she mentioned that this is being misconstrued and that we should discuss over coffee. I said I don't see how it's being misconstrued, I tried to do the right thing by you, but yes let's catch up and clear the air. She came back with stating she no longer felt it productive to have a face to face chat, she also told me that I don't value the friendship and that she needed to take a step back to evaluate the friendship. I simply responded with let me know by X date whether your attending as a guest or not. She then came back RSVPing yes. What's confusing is that after all this she RSVPD yes, however it's been two months and zero contact since. In my head I'm torn between do I withdraw the invite given how she feels about me and knowing I don't need that energy in a milestone like this, or, am I obligated to let it be and hope she doesn't pull a no show, or bring negativity and tension, considering I've had the opportunity to tell her not to come at all. 
What should I do here? 

EDIT: When I told her it wasnt an option to sit W me, I mean with her partner too. That table was meant for our really close family and bridal party. The reason for moving the other bridesmaid with her was because it was going to look weird having half the bridal party present.

They start a product that has its own segment in the market and they do it really well, they have customers that love what they do. Eventually, they start looking around for more revenue and notice a competitor in another niche (COD) and decide they want some of that.

So they start to blend their product between the two segments making it a meh version of both segments. Their original position is eroded while the other competitor still does the original segment better. They usually cockily think their original customers have no where else to go. What usually happens is a new business emerges in their original segment and does a pure play leaving the original company now orphaned with a product that isnt the best in either segment and they go bankrupt. If you are a dev shop out there, you could be the disruptor here.

## Key features Analysis

the S24 genuine leather wallet cases boast a range of features designed to enhance both the aesthetic appeal and practical utility of your device.

**Premium Genuine Leather Construction:**

Crafted from carefully selected genuine leather, these cases exude quality and sophistication. The leather is treated to ensure durability and resistance to wear and tear, providing a long-lasting and luxurious feel.Over time, the leather develops a unique patina, adding character and individuality to each case. The stitching is precise and robust, ensuring the case maintains its integrity even with daily use.

**Multi-Card Slots and Cash Pocket:**

Designed to streamline your everyday carry, these wallet cases typically feature multiple card slots capable of holding credit cards, IDs, and business cards.  A dedicated cash pocket provides a convenient space to store banknotes, receipts, or other small documents. The layout is thoughtfully designed to provide easy access to your essential items while maintaining a slim and compact profile.**Full-Body Protection:**

Beyond their aesthetic appeal, these cases offer robust protection against scratches, bumps, and minor drops. The inner shell,usually made of TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane),securely cradles the S24,providing shock absorption and preventing damage from accidental impacts. The raised edges around the screen and camera offer additional protection against scratches when the phone is placed on a flat surface.

**Precise Cutouts and Responsive Buttons:**

The cases are meticulously designed with precise cutouts for all ports, buttons, and speakers, ensuring unrestricted access to all of your S24's functions. The button covers are designed to be responsive and tactile, providing a comfortable and natural feel when pressing the volume or power buttons. This attention to detail ensures a seamless user experience.**Built-in Stand Function:**

For convenient hands-free viewing, many S24 genuine leather wallet cases include a built-in stand function.  This allows you to prop up your phone in landscape mode, perfect for watching videos, video conferencing, or browsing the web. The stand is typically sturdy and reliable,providing a stable viewing angle on various surfaces.**RFID Blocking Technology:**

To safeguard your personal data, some premium S24 genuine leather wallet cases incorporate RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) blocking technology. This feature shields your credit cards from unauthorized scanning, protecting you from potential identity theft and financial fraud. This added layer of security provides peace of mind in today's increasingly digital world.

## Core Benefits

The S24 genuine leather wallet case offers a compelling blend of style, protection, and convenience, providing several practical benefits for everyday use.**Enhanced Institution:**  By combining your phone case and wallet into a single accessory, you can streamline your everyday carry and reduce clutter.  This is especially beneficial for minimalist individuals who prefer to carry only the essentials. With dedicated slots for cards and cash, everything you need is conveniently located in one place.

**Premium Style and Sophistication:**  The genuine leather construction exudes a timeless elegance that elevates the look of your Samsung galaxy S24.The smooth texture and rich color of the leather create a sophisticated and professional impression. It is indeed an accessory that speaks to an individual's discerning taste and attention to detail.

**Improved Device Protection:**  These cases offer thorough protection against the hazards of daily use.  the durable leather exterior and shock-absorbing TPU inner shell work together to safeguard your S24 from scratches, dents, and minor impacts.

**Increased Convenience:**  Having your cards and cash readily accessible within your phone case simplifies everyday tasks.  Whether you're paying for groceries, showing your ID, or grabbing a coffee, everything you need is right at your fingertips. This eliminates the need to fumble with a separate wallet, saving you time and effort.

**Enhanced Security:**  RFID blocking technology provides an added layer of security, protecting your credit cards and personal information from electronic theft.  This is especially important in crowded public places where RFID skimming is a growing concern.By investing in a wallet case with this feature, you can enjoy greater peace of mind and protect your financial well-being.

## faqs Section

**Will the S24 genuine leather wallet case add significant bulk to my phone?**
While it does add some thickness compared to a slim case, the design is optimized to maintain a relatively slim profile. The trade-off for added protection and wallet functionality is minimal, especially considering the convenience it offers.

**How many cards can the wallet case typically hold comfortably?**
Most S24 genuine leather wallet cases are designed to comfortably hold 3-5 cards, depending on the thickness of the cards themselves. Overstuffing the case can strain the leather and perhaps damage the card slots, so it's best to stick to the recommended capacity.

**Is the leather prone to scratching or damage?**
Genuine leather is a durable material, but it is indeed susceptible to scratches and wear over time. Regular conditioning with a leather cleaner can help maintain its appearance and prolong its lifespan. Avoid exposing the case to excessive moisture or extreme temperatures, as this can damage the leather.

**Does the wallet case interfere with wireless charging?**
some thicker wallet cases may interfere with wireless charging. If wireless charging is important to you, look for cases that are specifically designed to be compatible with wireless charging pads.In some instances, removing cards from the slots may improve the charging efficiency.## Competitor Comparison

I want to know the man behind the eyes that haunt me, and I want you to know the woman behind these words. No second-guessing. No *“maybe.”* Just us.

I want you as my lover boy. My tower. My constant.

I dream of us not in glittering perfection, but in the kind of life that’s built **slowly, deeply**. Wandering the aisles of a market together, our hands brushing as we pick through fresh vegetables, deciding what dinner will be. Laughing when we disagree over which fruit is sweeter. Later, we’re on a beach - barefoot, blanket spread over warm sand, a basket between us with *wine, cheese, and snacks*. The air smells of salt and the night. We lean back to watch the stars scatter across the sky, the moon hanging low, *your hand tracing idle* *circles on my thigh until my breath catches*. We stay like that until sleep takes us, tangled together.

Then come the slow mornings. The ones where the world can wait. Your arm is locked around my waist, pulling me closer as if I might disappear. When I shift slightly, your lips find my ear & you murmur, *“Five more minutes.”* It turns into an hour.

We kiss without hurry, letting the moment stretch. We drift into the kitchen barefoot, the tiles cool under our feet. You make coffee, humming a tune slightly off-key, and I sit on the counter, watching you, smiling. When you hand me a bite of breakfast, I lean forward, tasting the warmth of your fingers before the food, feeling the brush of your skin.

Later, I’m in your lap, my head against your chest, listening to the steady rhythm of your heartbeat. We carry it into the shower, the steam wrapping around us. Your hands are slow, patient, running soap over my shoulders, my back, my hips. You rinse me gently, water sliding between us, and when it’s done, you take your time drying me off, like I’m something you’ll never rush.",4,1754713847.0,UnsentLettersRaw,5,1.0,False

That's all her note said. She loved me but left me? Her body left limp on the bed. Empty bottles on every side like she didn't know which to take so she took it all. 

My body was numb. My thoughts weren’t connecting, not bridging enough to make a sentence when I called 911.

“Girlfriend. Dead.” I said. I felt my stomach turn.

“Sir, can you hear me? Sir? Are you in danger?” I can hear her but I can’t respond. “Hold on, I’m tracing your call.”

My back falls against the wall and I slide down dropping to the ground. The police came quick I think, but I stayed on the floor as they knocked and then came in. Into the bedroom and they immediately rushed towards her on the bed. I was crying now. I felt the tears streaming down and dripping off my chin. 

“Sir, are you okay?” an officer was asking me. I couldn’t form words and when he spoke I think I started crying harder “Sir, what's your name?”

“Cory.” I tried to make out as best as I could. “Cory Murcey.”

The officer tried to raise me to my feet and help me out of the room as more police and aid officers filed in. 

“Whats your relation to the woman in the room Cory?” the officer asked.

“My girlfriend,” my breathing had calmed down just enough to control the crying, “We live here together.” 

“Are you okay if I ask a few more questions?”

I nodded and sniffled.

“How long have you two lived together?”

“Um, going on three years, but, uh, we just moved in here about six months ago.”

*It took two full runs with a uhaul and my truck bed to move us because she has so much big furniture. She said she couldn't help herself. She loved loved loved estate and antique sales. She had gotten great deals and didn't want to part with any of it. The buffet, a big clunky drafting table, the round kitchen table with matching chairs. But I loved that she loved to decorate our home.*

“When did you find her in the bedroom?”

“I called 911 when I walked in and saw her laying there.”

“Did you just get home?”

“Yes. I was working.” I could feel the tears starting to boil up around my eyes. “I was working at a different site today, Reno and Pitts.”

“What do you do?”

“I’m a locum pharmacist.”

“Locum?”

“Traveling pharmacist. Small pharmacies that have one full time pharmacist, like ones inside of family drug and grocery stores, I cover their sick days, vacations, stuff like that.”

“Where were you working today?”

“Morrie Grocerers.” The officer took notes as I tried my best to answer his questions. My body felt shaky. “I believe I left just after 7:30, she made my coffee this morning.”

*Her hand met mine handing over the coffee cup. She kissed my cheek and gave me the beautiful smile she always wore.*

“Did your girlfriend have any mental health problems? Do you know if she saw anyone for anything?”

 “She has a really hard time sleeping so she has a prescription for Ambien but that's all.”

“Ambien is a sleeping aide?”

“Yes, it’s zolpidem, a uh, sedative-hypnotic medication.”

“Had she been sleeping with the medication? Had you noticed any changes in her behavior?""

My heart starts beating faster. I don’t know. Truthfully we hadn’t spent my time on the same schedule lately. I was working a lot. She was finishing her degree and working evenings too. “She’s been stressed lately. She has finals coming up.”

*She came home last night and cuddled up next to me. I felt her touch even though I was sleeping, I felt her touch. Like she entered my dreams.* 

“She was going to school?”

“Yes. She’s finishing her last credits needed for her masters in social work.” I could feel my eyes filling again. I was going to start crying again and the officer knew.

“I think that can be all for now.” He said putting his arm on my shoulder, “Is there anyone we can call for you?”

“Uh, her parents. I don’t think I can do it.”

“We can take care of that.”

The officer left me sitting on our couch. The house was full of police coming and going. They huddled by the bedroom door talking in low hush voices. The officer who spoke with me joined them.

*She stood in the door just six months ago. I watched her lean against the doorway and plan how the set up could work.* 

*“We could put the bed on the wall with the window, put the dresser between the door for the closet and the bathroom.” she said.*

*I can hear her voice so vividly.* 

“Mr. Murcey?” An officer asked. I was brought back to the scene. “Mr. Mercury?”

“Yes. Sorry.” I said, shaking my head. Trying to turn down her voice that echoing inside my empty head.

“I know Officer Santana asked you a few questions already but I would like to ask a few myself if you’re up to it.”

“Uh,” her voice still pulled my insides apart, “Yeah. Anything.”

“I do see that a few bottles were around her. Some in her name like the ambien and and xanax but there is a bottle of oxycontin that is in yours.”

I shook my head with confusion, “Xanax? She wasn’t taking xanax.”

“The date on the bottle is recent so maybe you are unaware. But the oxycontin was yours. Where was it kept?”

My confusion deepened. “In the bathroom. In the cabinet, that's where all the medication is kept.”

“I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Murcey. At this point, it appears she may have taken her own life. She’ll be taken to the medical examiner’s office where they’ll perform an autopsy to officially determine the cause of death. But based on what we see so far, it looks like an overdose.” He stood over me for a moment. “There was this sticky note on the nightstand.”

## Key Features Analysis

The latest power inverters for trucks come packed with advanced features designed to enhance performance, safety, and convenience.

**Power Output:** Determining the proper power output is critical for choosing a power inverter.The Power output of a power inverter is measured in watts and indicates the continuous power it can supply.Most inverters are rated with both continuous and surge wattage. Continuous wattage is the amount of power the inverter can sustain for an extended period, while surge wattage refers to the maximum power it can provide for a short duration, typically to start appliances or tools that require a higher initial power draw. It is crucial to select an inverter with sufficient continuous wattage to accommodate the total power consumption of all devices you intend to run simultaneously.**Safety Features:** Safety should always be a top priority when using power inverters.

Modern power inverters incorporate a range of safety features to protect both the inverter and your connected devices. These features typically include overload protection, which automatically shuts down the inverter if it detects excessive current draw, preventing damage to the unit and connected appliances. Short circuit protection guards against electrical faults by instantly disconnecting the power supply in the event of a short circuit. Additionally, many inverters feature thermal protection, which monitors the internal temperature and shuts down the inverter to prevent overheating, enhancing safety and prolonging its lifespan. Some models also include reverse polarity protection, safeguarding the inverter from damage if the battery cables are accidentally connected in reverse.**Efficiency Rating:** A higher efficiency rating translates to less wasted energy and longer battery life.

The Efficiency rating of a power inverter refers to the percentage of DC power it converts into usable AC power. A higher efficiency rating means less energy is lost during the conversion process, resulting in more power available for your devices and extended battery life. Inverters with high efficiency ratings minimize heat generation, enhancing their safety and reliability. Look for models with efficiency ratings of 90% or higher to maximize power utilization and minimize energy waste.

**Waveform Type:** Understanding the waveform type is essential for compatibility with different types of devices.

Power inverters produce either a sine wave or a modified sine wave output. Sine wave inverters generate a smooth, consistent power output similar to that of a standard wall outlet, making them suitable for sensitive electronic devices such as laptops, televisions, and medical equipment. Modified sine wave inverters, conversely, produce a stepped waveform that is less refined. While they are generally more affordable,modified sine wave inverters may not be compatible with all types of devices,and some sensitive electronics may experience performance issues or even damage when powered by them. Choose a sine wave inverter for maximum compatibility and optimal performance with a wide range of devices.

**connectivity Options:** Versatile connectivity options ensure compatibility with a variety of devices

The Connectivity options available on a power inverter determine its versatility and compatibility with different types of devices. Most inverters feature standard AC outlets for powering household appliances and tools. Many models also include USB ports for charging smartphones, tablets, and other USB-powered devices. Some advanced inverters may offer additional connectivity options such as DC terminals for direct connection to batteries, remote control ports for convenient operation from a distance, and even Bluetooth connectivity for monitoring and controlling the inverter from a smartphone or tablet.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions regarding power inverters for trucks.

**What size power inverter do I need?**
The size of the power inverter you need depends on the total wattage of the devices you plan to run simultaneously. Start by calculating the wattage requirements of all devices and add them together. Choose an inverter with a continuous wattage rating that exceeds this total to ensure it can handle the load. It's also essential to consider the surge wattage of certain appliances or tools, as they may require more power when starting.

**How do I connect a power inverter to my truck's battery?**
Power inverters typically come with battery cables that you can use to connect directly to your truck's battery. Ensure that the inverter is switched off before making any connections.Connect the positive (red) cable to the positive terminal of the battery and the negative (black) cable to the negative terminal. Securely tighten the connections to prevent them from coming loose. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper installation and safety precautions.**Can I run my truck's battery flat by using a power inverter?**
Yes, excessive use of a power inverter can drain your truck's battery if the engine is not running. The inverter draws power from the battery to convert it into AC power, which can deplete the battery over time. To prevent this, it is recommended to run your truck's engine periodically to recharge the battery while using the inverter. Additionally,consider using a battery charger or maintainer to keep the battery topped up when the inverter is not in use.

And I’m not complaining.

As an ambitious Man who appreciates beauty in all forms (of course, adults only) and all races I’ll admit it, when I see a woman looking amazing in yoga pants, my first thought is often “I should say something.”

Sometimes I do approach and politely ask her out. But it got me wondering… in today’s world, is that overstepping? Is it inappropriate to pursue someone in public based purely on attraction? Or is it just shooting my shot the old-fashioned way?

Where’s the line between confidence and being “that guy”? Because when someone looks that delicious in yoga pants, it’s hard not to want to find out more.

What’s your take? Ladies, how would you feel if a man approached you in the cereal aisle or school parking lot just because you looked incredible in yoga pants?

Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras—none of that was ever her. She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer—whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his own world, too caught up in the demands of his fame to see how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.

Everything turns into a fight. We all feel like we have to walk on eggshells, not to upset or offend Mom. Then she gets upset when she realizes that's what we're doing and says that we are just cutting her out of everything. Everything is about her, and it just feels like we get backed into a corner. When we try to calm her down, it just gets worse. She's always been a little more critical than most as an Enneagram 8, Type A personality, but now it's like that, but as the Hulk.

1mlgd27,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1mlgd27/becoming_bored_and_careless_with_cheating/,Becoming bored and careless with cheating,"My girlfriend went out of town last weekend for work and whilst she was gone I downloaded bumble and quickly matched with a cute University student also searching for something short term. 

We made plans to meet Tuesday - my girlfriend was set to return the day before. It took a little finessing but wasn’t too complicated. My girlfriend and I don’t live together but we’re neighbors so being in each others place is common. She arrived Monday as expected and took the day to unpack and chill before returning to the office on Tuesday. I spent the day with her, even falling asleep next to her in her bed that evening  - but not before finally responding to the girl I’d be meeting tomorrow for our first date to let her know I’d still be there at 12. 

My girlfriend heads to work Tuesday morning, I stay asleep. But I did get up in time to workout before my date. I let the other girl know I’m heading to the park we’re set to meet at. She tells me she has two blunts rolled and that she’s bringing her puppy, “Mr. Man”. I arrive at the park in a business casual attire, she’s more casual. We click and I find it easy to talk to her, evident by her laughing at my jokes - so I know she’s feeling me too. We spend about an hour and half at the park before deciding it’s time to end it and Before getting in my car to leave she says “we should meet again”. I agree. 

My girlfriend is none the wiser and since I’m back at my place after she’s off work, I easily text with the side chick and we decide to meet again Wednesday. This time we’ve decided on coffee and to play chess. My girlfriend heads to work on Wednesday. Again I meet the other girl, Again, we speak seamlessly and ceaselessly as she bests me in every chess match. This time my girlfriend is more chatty and I have to try to be unassuming as I’m responding to her texts. “Work” I tell my date. We leave the cafe and get into my car to continue chatting. We don’t talk long before we’re enjoying our first kiss together and we prolong it for several minutes as we make out in my front seat. Time must have sped up because by the time I was able to compose myself and drive back to my house it was time for my girlfriend to get off work. Since we’re neighbors I needed to hurry. I make it back just in time to brush my teeth before she’s texting me that she’s headed my place. Close call. 

Then yesterday, the other girl and I make plans to meet earlier in the day. I’ve had 3 dates in 3 days with this girl and this one escalated quickly. We met at 10am at a park by my house where we decided we’d do a yoga flow. She’s wearing a sports bra and doing stances and flows I’m impressed she’s able to do. I’m in great shape but was pushing myself in this workout with her. I use that as a reason to remove my shirt and she’s receptive and I see this as my cue to go for it. After we finish working out, I ask if she wants to come back to my place to get water and cool off. She concurs and we make the short drive back there. 

First, she gets a water and then we smoke a blunt together on my porch. I’m lowkey worried my girlfriend will drive by and see an unfamiliar car in my driveway or one of the neighbors will see us smoking, but I stay calm. Once the blunt is out we go inside and after I brush my teeth it’s about 30 seconds before we’re revisiting each others lips and mouths. I have sex with her right there on my couch and also on the chair. It was great sex so I finish on her chest. She showers and leaves not long after that.

“Come on, let's keep riding, I don’t hear anything!” My sister whines.

“Yeah Jet, I can’t hear anything, let's go.” I say, agreeing with my sister, Paige.

“No! Listen!” Jet says, pointing to the bushes and trees off the road. I get off my bike and wheel it over to where Jetson is standing while my sister starts making annoying noises in her annoyance of being held up. I stop where Jetson is and listen hard. I hear it, the rushing of water, a river. The bushes and trees were probably hiding a river that we haven’t found yet, despite living in this neighborhood for most of our lives! 

“Yo! It might be a river! That’s awesome! A new discovery!” I say, excitedly because I was annoyed at the neighborhood because of the lack of new things to discover. My brother knows of my excitement in new discoveries as he is nodding, proud of himself.“I can’t hear anything! And even if it is a river, so what?! Come on, let's go home, I'm hungry.” Paige 	whines. I turn around to face her.

“Go home if you want! Me and Jetty will explore the river ourselves!” I snap at her, louder than I meant to.

“Stop being annoying.” Jetson says to Paige.

“Y-you're not going to come home with me?” Paige asks, a hint of tears in her eyes.

“No, you already know the way.” I respond, pushing the bike onto the grass off the road and kicking the stand down. I motion Jetson to follow and start walking towards the sound of the river as Paige takes off, crying.”Maybe you shouldn’t have shouted at her.” Jetson says, matter-of-factly. I turn around to face him.

“Have I told you about the times when me and “my” dad were living in Thailand? About how I had no genuine friends except for annoying idiots? Huh? I ask him angrily. 

“Well if you can’t control your temper then you're no better than them.” Jetson responds. Damn, he’s good at that, giving rational responses. I opened my mouth to argue but I stopped, Jetson was right, and I was mad about it. We bushwhack in silence until we reach the clearing where the river was. It was… Wrong… The river seemed to be whispering as it flowed, an evil presence trying to communicate… Giving warnings. It smelled… Like… Rotting fruit and it had a metallic whiff to it. It was shadowed by great trees towering over us like guardians of the river. I also remember thinking it couldn’t be possible for the river to be here. Like, we were in New-Port-Richey where there were inlets from the ocean at the back of the properties, where people would get their skiffs, travel up the inlets and to the ocean and fish. What I’m trying to get at is that there shouldn’t be enough space! There would be no room, we should be at the side of one the inlets, on the mangroves but no, it was a spacious clearing and the river was definitely not one of the inlets because it was too narrow and it was the wrong color! The inlets were green, a muddy green! This was the wrong color, it was… Black... This river shouldn’t be here, it was wrong.

“Weird, right?” I ask Jet, expecting him to not understand and to ask what was weird. Jet didn’t respond and when I looked at him he had a distant look in his eyes.

“Jet?” I ask, tentatively. Jetson ignores me still and takes a step towards the river.

“Jet!” I say, raising my voice.

“What the hell are you doing?” I add in. Jetson continues to ignore me and takes steps. He reaches the bank next to the rapids and drops down onto his knees.

“JET!” I shout. Jetson whispers back to the river, as if the river actually was whispering and Jetson was just responding. I stride over to him and put a hand on his shoulder.

“Dude, stop ignoring me and stop acting weird, it’s creepy.”I say, Jetson ignores this. Jetson points to the river. I look to where he points, and I don’t notice it at first but then I see it, his reflection was missing!

“Dude, what the fu-”. I began but I noticed Jet was gone. I spun around, looking for him, and then I spotted him, he was being pulled down the rapids! 

“JET!!!” I shouted and jumped in after him and then I thudded against the ground. 

“What the hell?” I say, getting up on my shaky knees. The river was gone, it was just dirt, soil and mud, and through the bushes in the clearing, I saw the green murky inlet, mangroves on the side. My mum and my stepfather didn’t believe me. The cops didn’t believe me as well, of course they didn’t, who would believe that story? No one! The aftermath of the incident was horrible, when I dove into the ground, my lower face hit a rock stuck into the terrain. That caused me to dislocate my jaw and lose a few molars. My right knee hit the ground pretty hard as well, so I also fractured that kneecap. The cops checked out the scene of the incident and couldn’t find the river of course, only the inlet, which should have been there in the first place! They said that Jetson probably went to the side of the inlet, bent down to drink the water and fell in and got swept away and I tried to dive in but got turned around and dove into the ground. Like, what the hell! Who would drink water from the murky green inlet? And how could Jetson get swept away? The inlets have no current and Jetson can swim pretty well. Of course I tried explaining this to them but they stuck with their conclusion. My mum doesn’t blame me, my stepfather doesn’t as well but they are really really… Incomplete… They don’t seem happy anymore, their smiles are rarer, fainter… My mum stirs her coffee for ages and doesn’t drink it and my stepfather just watches show he used to love blankly, without any expression whatsoever. 

“I know you’re telling the truth, bro.” Paige would say to me every now and then. I appreciated that, and I wished I hadn’t snapped at her. Of course I have tried to find the river again, and, of course, I didn’t find it… Every time I go there it’s just… The side of the inlet… The mangroves poking out from the mud… Lately I have been feeling really depressed… Maybe if we just continued riding around this wouldn’t have happened, I could have stopped it but I didn’t… And that’s what stuck with me since then… One day, on a windy and rainy day, I stopped at the side of the road where behind the bushes and trees, the river was there. I thought about Jetson, how I could have stopped it, how I didn’t, and how I wanted to join him wherever he was… I bushwhacked and I reached the clearing, there was no inlet and mangroves… There was the river, back to claim me as well. I didn’t hesitate, I dove straight into the black, whispering water…

Where do I begin??,"I am moving out this week into a 1 bedroom apartment and will be living alone for the first time in my life! I’ve lived with roommates the past few years and although I’m very excited to have my own space, my past roommates were the source of the majority of shared furniture (couch, dining table, coffee table, etc.). 

I’m pretty low maintenance and am fairly busy between work and school so I’m not in a rush to furnish my apartment from head to toe. I have also been putting off furniture shopping because I didn’t want to purchase a lot of big stuff just to move it all soon after. I’m wanting to enjoy the process of finding furniture/decor and getting to make my new place feel like my own. 

Obviously things like a couch and a dining table are higher on my list as they seem more necessary than say a coffee table or a large flat screen TV but I don’t want to wait too long on something I didn’t expect I would want so badly! I’m a single person in my early 20s so my budget isn’t crazy but like I said I’m okay with slowly building my place from the ground up. Where would you suggest I begin? Are second hand stores or Facebook marketplace okay or should I stick with larger retailers? What is something you wouldn’t think you would need as much as you actually do?",1,1754713146.0,LivingAlone,2,1.0,False
