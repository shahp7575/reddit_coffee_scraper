1k3ar6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k3ar6p/first_espresso_grinder_1200/,First Espresso Grinder? [$1200],"USD

Currently looking for my first espresso grinder. I previously posted here (https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jziuf7/first_espresso_machine_and_grinder_3000/) and chose my first espresso machine as the Rancilio Silvia Pro X for back-to-back cappuccinos and lattes. I again posted here (https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k29amx/us_chris_coffee_vs_clive_coffee/) to determine where to buy the espresso machine. Now the journey continues, as I still need a grinder!

After some feedback on grinder options in my previous post, I have dug deeper and learned more (hopefully). I am now considering the following options:

- Niche Zero ($669)
- Mazzer Philos ($1195)
- Varia VS6 ($749)
- Femobook A68 ($799)
- Timemore 064s ($569)
- Timemore 078s ($759)
- Ceado E5SD ($859)

(I was also considering the Lagom Casa, but it sounds like tarrifs have sort of ruined that option; they seem to not be shippibg to the US?)

The thing is, I've never owned espresso equipment. I have very good cafes near me that I frequent, and have good beans for pourover. So I sort of (?) know what I like. Unfortunately what I like is ""blueberry and chocolate"" at the same time... so I know I'd *probably* like a conical medium roast, but probably not so much a citrus fruit over a berry (if that makes sense). I don't like any ""strong"" flavors, really; not too acidic, definitely not sour, and not burnt or bitter either... balanced?

I like that the Philos has two burr options (I'd start with the 189), but its massive. The Niche seems like the ""obvious"" choice for learning how to make ""good"" espresso, but I worry I'd just end up wanting to upgrade once I figured it out. The A68 seems like maybe it has more balanced flavor than the Niche, though, based on reviews. The Timemore seems like a cheaper option to the Philos (though I don't know how to decide on 64 vs 78). No one talks about the Varia because everyone seems to have gotten scared by the VS3. And Ceado lost its popularity but seems to still be built very well. How does one decide?

For what it's worth, the Philos seems like the obvious best choice other than its size and price. I'm not sure if I'll be able to tell the difference between any of these with a (in all likelihood) less than refined palatte. Plus if I'm just making milk drinks, how much does any of this even matter?

As far as the whole conical vs flat thing, it sounds like a generalization. There are so many flat burr options out there that I'm sure flat geometries can do just fine with making a syrupy shot. The Philos 189 does and maybe the Timemore, too?

I *will not* be buying any DF grinder. I like quality and longevity; sorry.

4 min. readView original

Slowly but surely, a grey army is marching on many of Australia‚Äôs bigger regional towns, replacing youngsters chasing careers and faster-paced lives elsewhere.

The trend, described by¬†[demographer Bernard Salt](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/population-blow-torch-the-two-fastest-growing-places-on-the-continent/news-story/4a6ac88af5cc33a6092545862326ff32)¬†in Saturday‚Äôs Inquirer, is palpable in centres such as Victoria‚Äôs Horsham and Queensland‚Äôs Charters Towers.

And it seems the phenomenon is here to stay, keeping these towns alive but adding to already-stretched medical services.

Horsham, a laid-back¬†[community grown up](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/when-world-ends-head-to-horsham-for-seeds-of-new-life/news-story/d3ddff0740b0a413913253fc75a584d9)¬†around a bend on the Wimmera River, is projected to grow from 20,506 residents in 2025 to 21,024 in 2035.

The key to this growth is not newborns or migrants but rather over-70s, typically retiring from smaller towns and farms to enjoy more social autumnal years ‚Äì and gain better access to health services.

Horsham will see a projected net increase of 936 over-70s by 2035, more than offsetting the 300 fewer under-34s. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a case of retirees in, and young workers and kids and teenagers out,‚Äù Salt explains.

But far from turning such towns into ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs waiting rooms‚Äù, many of these retirees bring time, commitment, energy ‚Äì and superannuation dollars ‚Äì to their adopted homes.

They fill the cafes and local bowls and croquet clubs, and some are even being lured back to work, to fill the jobs left by departing youngsters.

Douglas and Jennie Mitchell decided to move to the outskirts of Horsham, from their mixed farm near Beulah, about 100km away, to guarantee the kind of retirement they wanted.

‚ÄúI knew if we retired into Beulah, I‚Äôd be at the farm every day and my son would tell me I was a bloody nuisance,‚Äù explains Douglas, 72. ‚ÄúBy being 100km away, I only go to the farm when I really have to.

‚ÄúMy wife‚Äôs father retired into Beulah and he went out to the farm every day, so he never really retired. I just said ‚ÄòNup, we‚Äôre going to go far enough away that I can do me own thing, he can do his own thing up on the farm‚Äô.‚Äù

Douglas and Jennie Mitchell at a Horsham cafe with friends. ‚ÄòHere you can go to the coffee shop of a morning, and meet up with a whole heap of friends, and it keeps us sane,‚Äô says Douglas. Picture: Nadir Kinani

The couple are conscious of the impact such migrations have on dwindling small towns such as Beulah but found the lure of life in the big-ish smoke irresistible.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre probably half the reason the little towns are dying, but here (in Horsham) you can go to the coffee shop of a morning, and meet up with a whole heap of friends, and it keeps us sane,‚Äù Douglas explains.

They‚Äôre in good company. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt call it Horsham, we call it Beulah south ‚Äì there‚Äôs so many people from up that way ‚Äì Hopetoun, Beulah, Rainbow, Yaapeet, Birchip, Watchem ‚Äì they‚Äôre all going to the bigger regional towns,‚Äù Douglas says.

There were practical as well as social drivers for the exodus. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a doctor in Beulah, whereas here, while there‚Äôs still a shortage of doctors, you‚Äôve got more chance of getting to see one,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs heaps of dentists, and we‚Äôve got a hospital if there‚Äôs an emergency.‚Äù

The couple are members of multiple clubs, including bowling, croquet, historical vehicle appreciation and Rotary.

‚ÄúIn Horsham, you‚Äôve got four bowling clubs you can choose from,‚Äù Douglas says. ‚ÄúFriends, and myself occasionally also play table tennis. There are so many sports for retirees to pick up.

‚ÄúThere are so many things you can do, whereas if you retired in Beulah you‚Äôd be sitting around watching TV all the time.‚Äù

While missing the farm, the Mitchells have not looked back. ‚ÄúYou come here and you make a new life ‚Äì the blokes that sit in their house and fret because they‚Äôve nothing to do, they‚Äôll die,‚Äù Douglas says.

‚ÄúWhereas here you can get involved in clubs, involved in community and meet new friends. We‚Äôve just got a complete new lot of friends.‚Äù

Jennie and Douglas Mitchell at a spot on the Wimmera River where they hang out with friends in Horsham. ‚ÄòWhen we were on the farm, you always had to drive at least half an hour to get somewhere ‚Äì now in a couple of seconds, I‚Äôm in town,‚Äô says Jennie. Picture: Nadir Kinani

Like others, Douglas has been lured back to the tools to help fill Horsham‚Äôs skills shortage.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm working two jobs at the moment ‚Äì I‚Äôm supposed to be retired!‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe young ones are leaving and there‚Äôs no one to take on a lot of these jobs.‚Äù

As well as sowing crops at Longerenong College, he is helping out at a farm machinery firm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still a farmer at heart,‚Äù he says.

Jennie, 65, enjoys no longer having to drive long distances. ‚ÄúWhen we were on the farm, you always had to drive at least half an hour to get somewhere,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúNow in a couple of seconds I‚Äôm in town. It‚Äôs a wonderful place.‚Äù

She has continued her involvement with the Country Women‚Äôs Association and joined bird and garden clubs. ‚ÄúI also teach dancing, mainly line dancing and a little bit of old-time or bush dancing,‚Äù she says.

Living in a larger town made trips to the city quicker and easier. ‚ÄúLiving in places like Horsham you can catch a bus to Melbourne or Ballarat, whereas on the farm you‚Äôre so far out,‚Äù she says.

Salt suggests the nation may need a new labour force planning team to incentivise skilled labour, especial medicos, to follow these grey saviours to the nation‚Äôs new regional ‚Äúislands‚Äù.

A grey army is saving Australia‚Äôs bigger regional towns, retiring from farms and smaller towns to centres such as Horsham. They bring cash, skills and vibrancy.Cashed-up grey army bringing salvation to regional towns

Grew up hard, built myself from the ground up, now living life on my terms.

I'm 6'4, tattooed, and dialed into the life I want. I've written four books, own two businesses, and have a thirst for enjoying life. I have amazing friends, great relationships with my siblings, and open for real connection. I'm just missing you.

I‚Äôm the guy who‚Äôll challenge your thinking, call you out (with love), and kiss you like I mean it.
I train hard, work deep, read everything, and don‚Äôt waste time on surface-level anything.
I don‚Äôt drink, don‚Äôt party, and I‚Äôm agnostic‚Äîso if your idea of fun is Sunday service and wine nights, I‚Äôm not your guy.

But if you want electric chemistry, late-night conversations that actually go somewhere, amazing play times, and a man who shows up...I might be exactly what you‚Äôre looking for.

You should message me if:
You‚Äôre emotionally intelligent, can handle real talk, and aren‚Äôt afraid of passion or presence. You‚Äôve got your own goals. You own your past. And you‚Äôre ready for something different.

You should also have the ability to travel. I've lived in 12 countries and been to 40ish, though I probably call Las Vegas home.

Pros about dating me:
- Financially secure 
- Tall
- High IQ and EQ
- Wordly 
- Love Music and Concerts 
- Avid Reader
- Coffee addict
- Explorer of all capacities. üòâ
- I'll hold your hand, post you, and make sure you are seen
- I know how to protect my woman 
- Once a week I'll cook you amazing good

Cons about dating me:
- Allergic to animals, shellfish, Gluten and Dairy
- I work a lot but I never miss important things 
- I can be pretty stubborn 
- I tend to lean more into logic than feelings 
- I can be very annoying with my ""me-isms""
- I am a very sexual person. If you are not we won't make it.
- I grew up in a very traumatic home so sometimes I need more emotional patience than most  

Deal Breakers:
	‚Ä¢	You have kids now. 
	‚Ä¢	You want me to read the Bible or go to church (hard pass)
	‚Ä¢	You use hard drugs or drink like you‚Äôre still in college
	‚Ä¢	You ghost, breadcrumb, or avoid hard conversations

Bottom line:
I‚Äôm not here to fix you, save you, or chase you.
But if you‚Äôre the kind of woman who craves depth, fire, and a connection that‚Äôs actually worth showing up then let's chat.

Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs possible.

But this is different. my mom can't seem to remember very important things about me and I have to constantly remind her. Its been this way for as long as I can remember. It's not like she is genuinely forgetting them due to age. 

I just need to rant for a moment: 

I am a chronically ill person with a few conditions, one of them being I am frequently in the bathroom. My mom came with me to all of my urology appointments, even was with me when I had to be put to sleep so docs could look inside my bladder. But then very often she will see me in the bathroom for a long time and go ""why were you in there so long?"" And I will just stare at her for a min and respond ""yeah i have a really overactive bladder, remember?"" And she will go ""oh yeah."" And move on. She does this all the time with road trips. She KNOWS I don't do road trips for this very reason and yet CONSTANTLY asks me if I want to go on road trips with her to places. I get upset and ask to please try to remember that I cannot do this because of my bladder and she never understands why I get upset, and my family will all join her in confusion even though they all know. They have seen me present them with my actual medical records and diagnosis and yet they all still go ""what's wrong with her???????"" around me 24/7. 

Other examples: I have asked her not to get me bday gifts because she won't remember things I like nor does she respect any lists I used to give her when I was younger. Every year despite my (polite) protests, she gets me things she knows I won't like. I've  asked for gift cards instead but she never does that, she only gets what she wants for me, knowing I'll be upset about it. She never remembers foods I don't like. Every time she goes to the grocery store, she will ask me for a list, then never gets anything from that list and will buy things she knows I won't eat or I can't even have, like coffee and stuff. She knows I hate being wasteful and then will actually be surprised when I'm upset about wasting money on coffee no one will drink. The combos usually go like this: ""mom you just wasted $9 on this coffee?"" ""I got it for you!"" ""I can't have coffee, though"" ""oh well!"" ""So now we have this giant thing of coffee no one will drink"" ""I was trying to be nice"" and it's like that, all the time. She won't listen to reason. 

Bottom line, this is driving a wedge between us. I don't know what else to do. I feel so whiny. I am so grateful for the ways she's helped me in my life, but this baffles me. I've tried so hard to help her and if she won't take my help or reminders, then to me... she's made it clear she doesn't respect my boundaries nor does she ever listen to me. I don't get how a parent can be living in some ways and so hurtful in other ways?

A huge pepino thank you to u/Icy_Independent7944 who wrote a [brilliant recap of episode 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1jua9y9/icy_indy_filling_in_for_ready_bats_the_baldwins/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)! Muchas grathias, Icy!! Thanks to you, I was able to take a short road trip with Mr. Bat and the little bats without writing. No nannies, no cats, no camera crew. My 3 kids didn‚Äôt swear at each other or run around screaming. My 11-year-old daughter didn‚Äôt have black bra straps hanging out of a tight tank top and my 5-year-old didn‚Äôt ask for popcorn 27 times while I ignored her. A success.

**On with the recap!**

I cannot fully express to you, fellow pepinos, how thrilled I am that this show - Chest Chesty Bang Bang if you will - has shuddered to a stop. These eight episodes (I only watched 7 thanks to Icy) have really been a painful slog. I mean, I knew these people were terrible humans but watching them try to pretend they're not was wild.

**Four Minute Opening Segment ‚Äú5 Days ‚Äòtil Manhattan‚Äù**

* TLC is really scraping the bottom of the barrel showcasing last day of camp and Hillary spraying her kids down with sunscreen. This is why this recap took me forever to write ‚Äì the show is so fricking boring and inane that I could not focus.
* Hillary is baby talking about getting to camp and we hear Marilu screeching *‚Äúnot going to camp!‚Äù* Hillary tries to distract her by talking about what kind of backpack she wants for the new school year. ML replies that she wants a poopoo backpack and Hillary laughs and says they probably make those, so why not.

[Pretty much all the kids hate school - sad. ](https://preview.redd.it/8xm1pzi2pvve1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=61157f0d2faf5b65d166492de655f70b55541466)

* Couch Hillary and Alec talk about the *‚Äúvery interesting‚Äù* summer they had.
   * Hilz asks Alec: *‚Äúhow do you hope they remember it?‚Äù*
   * Alec: *‚Äúthat it was an interesting summer, that they had a good time, they had their summer‚Äù*
* Pretzel Couch Hillary rasps *‚Äúwe are a big family who‚Äôs been through a lot of things‚Äù* (does the size of the family matter in this context?) and she is thrilled that they now get to *‚Äúmake more choices‚Äù* because they have not had the ability to do this over the past few years. I beg to differ. Alllllllll of this was a choice:

[This is more true to who she is than anything we saw on the show.](https://preview.redd.it/ohope7i6pvve1.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=17b10c48750e639d929c25158900f0c400ce4cb8)

* Hilz notes that all the kids have *‚Äústrong personalities‚Äù* as they fight and fuss and whine on this last day of summer camp. She repeats her line about tuning out when things get loud and *‚Äúlowering my imaginary volume button.‚Äù* Hillary, poodle, dissociating while parenting is generally frowned upon.
* Frumpy Couch Alec says *‚Äúwho knows what‚Äôs the right thing to do is when we get back to the city. Like do you want to go back to work, do you want to do this, do you want to do that? I‚Äôm kinda like, I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt really know.‚Äù* Stop it, Zander. You would give anything to be at the peak of your fame again and work with big names on quality projects.

**Hillary and Alec Do Yoga**

* Hillary shames Alec into doing some yoga by saying *‚Äúyou‚Äôve had two hips that were fixed, and you didn‚Äôt do enough physical therapy‚Äù* she claims to put his socks on for him and that *‚Äúflexibility is one of the most important things for health and for the aging.‚Äù*
* She yip yaps forever and then says *‚ÄúCan I tell you? Can I tell you? Our trauma is our sadness in your hips.‚Äù* This dummy has the common sense of a carrot.
* Bendy Couch Hilz says: *‚ÄúThis summer we lived with tremendous anxiety, tremendous stress‚Äù* (cut to her running with the grace of Luisa from Encanto, IYKYK) *‚Äúand I know that if I run, exercise, do yoga every day ¬†I can be pretty centered and focused and if I don‚Äôt I feel like in a cloud and everything feels very loud.‚Äù* Where‚Äôs her internal volume knob? Also, I‚Äôd like to note that she said all the above in the most mainstream US English accent I have ever heard out of her mouth. The lies, y‚Äôall
* We get a whole montage of Hillary exercising claiming it makes her a better mom ‚Äì what‚Äôs the exercise that will make her put the phone down and pay attention to her kids without a camera around? That‚Äôs the one she needs.

[Her running form makes me giggle every time.](https://preview.redd.it/yfw9r1djpvve1.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccaef48e4b2a82c57c3c31a91c01186398dc407a)

* Mechanic Coverall Couch Hilz: *‚Äú\[Exercising with me\] is just not Alec‚Äôs thing, and it*'*s not just the age difference. It‚Äôs just that he‚Äôs a theater kid, and I‚Äôm a jock and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù* ¬†An insult to theater kids and jocks worldwide.
* Cut to Hillary manipulating Alec into a yoga pose and sitting on his back (how are those hip replacement holding up, Alec?) while the cats surround them:
   * Hilz: *‚ÄúYou do definitely hold trauma up here in your shoulders.‚Äù*
   * Alec: *‚ÄúWell where do I have trauma in my ass or my shoulders? Which is it‚Äù*
   * Hilz: *‚ÄúAre you feeling it in both?*
   * Alec: (laughing\*) ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù\*
   * Hilz: (smiling at the camera) *‚Äúwell there it is, definitely trauma is right there!‚Äù*

[The trauma is that we are watching this. ](https://preview.redd.it/iq03l3sopvve1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=886e440b9330fa6d4f8d130ebfb0908cbac86576)

* She has him sit up and jabs her knee into his butt:
   * Alec: *‚ÄúThe knee in my ass feels kinda good.‚Äù*
   * Hilz: *‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing better than a butt massage‚Äù*
   * Alec: (looking at the cats on the window seat) *‚Äúthe cats are touching my pillows‚Äù*
   * Hilz: *‚ÄúThe cats do their own yoga‚Äù*
* Alec tickles Hillz then snaps into director mode after he struggles to his feet. He sits in an armchair and says *‚ÄúCould we talk about something seriously? Sit down.‚Äù* Instead of sitting in the other chair in this nice sitting area, Hillary sprawls on the floor and puts her feet up so Alec can give her a foot rub:
   * Alec: *‚ÄúSo I played sports‚Äù* (he played high school football) *‚Äúand I was trimmer and fitter and stronger until I was about 40. Then I worked a lot and had a kid‚Ä¶to be married to somebody who is a physically fit as you as I‚Äôm kinda like slipping, y‚Äôknow my strength and coordination‚Ä¶it is bizarre.*
   * Hillary: *‚Äúpeople who say age doesn‚Äôt matter that‚Äôs like the stupidest thing t say because of course it matters‚Äù*
   * Alec: *‚ÄúIf I go out into the world and try to get a job acting* (he cannot wait for this) *you gotta be aware of that. I just wanna, y‚Äôknow, um, get healthy.‚Äù*
   * Hillary: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm seeing a difference in you‚Ä¶I‚Äôm seeing you more at the gym, I‚Äôm you more calmer‚Äù (not a typo, she‚Äôs just dumb). She babbles forever about getting healthy and both Alec and I tune her out.

[If this show gets a second season, I will picket TLC‚Äôs headquarters.](https://preview.redd.it/0tryb93wpvve1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3d4408b63b833d206572d12709b44c4a84980b3)

* Red Sweater Couch Hilz and Dress Shirt & Shorts Alec continue with the ‚Äúhealth‚Äù theme:
   * Alec: *‚Äúwhat I‚Äôve been dealing with over the past few years really negatively impacted my health, and I wasn‚Äôt like that. No matter what I had, my hip hurt this hurt, and I had energy. And now it sucked all of the energy out of me. A year from now, I want to be, I want to have put a lot of focus on my health and have that be very different.‚Äù* Hillary flares her eyes and nods emphatically. The gall. He caused a person‚Äôs death and he and his dizzy wife are rolling around doing yoga bemoaning his trauma and declining health.
   * Alec: \*‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget we‚Äù(\*we who?) *‚Äúdid Woody‚Äôs movie, Blue Jasmine.‚Äù* Cut to picture of him and Woody Allen and Alec does an impression of Allen telling him his character was a ladies man so he wanted Alec to lose some weight. *‚ÄúAnd I did‚Äù* (to Hillary) *‚ÄúRemember that? Oh my God, I did the -‚Äù*
   * \*\*Hilz: (interrupting) ‚Äú\*\****But you didn‚Äôt lose weight because of Woody!‚Äù*** **He literally just said he lost weight per Woody‚Äôs request.**
   * **Alec: (irritated)** ***‚ÄúWell hold on, I‚Äôm gonna tell my, this is my Woody story.‚Äù*** **Hillary rolls her eyes.**

[The moment Hilz what like, nobody puts Baby in a corner.](https://preview.redd.it/ch2cxd04qvve1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a4bf9ff2c65cb1fcaf2f7582381ed9669228d06)

* **Alec:** ***‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have no pasta, no potatoes, no candy, no sugar and I lost probably 25 pounds.‚Äù*** **Hillary shakes her head and points her index finger up.** ***‚ÄúMore? 30?‚Äù***
* **Hillary: (quietly)** ***‚ÄúIt was 40.‚Äù***
* **Alec:** ***‚ÄúI thought I lost 30 but I didn‚Äôt want to brag. But you see me in the movie and I‚Äôm trim, comparatively speaking, but I did have the barbeque sauce in my hair.‚Äù*** **Cut to him with a bad dye job for the movie.**
* **Hillary: (full accent)** ***‚ÄúI like him better salt and pepper‚Äù***
* **Alec:** ***‚ÄúI thought to myself the guy*** **\[the character he played\]** ***would dye his hair so I did that.‚Äù***
* **Hillary: (calmly but petulantly)** ***‚ÄúNo, you used to dye your hair because you liked it. You were dating a 27-year-old yoga instructor, litra-lee. ¬†And that‚Äôs why you lost weight.‚Äù*** **She smiles at the producers. Dayum, passive aggressive much, Hillary? She was like, you‚Äôre gonna try to shut me down on MY show? Hold my skinny latte.**
* **Alec: (deadpan) ‚ÄúYeah that‚Äôs why I dyed my hair.‚Äù**

[The moment Alec realizes  just how badly he messed up by picking this dim bulb to be his second wife.](https://preview.redd.it/i2e1n9ifqvve1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=893276d7288ad31358ede32efb64ebcaa88b7905)

¬†**Hillary is a Bad Parent (should have been the caption)**

* Hillary, Carmen, Leo, and Romeo are the front porch. The kids are eating Ruffles (buh-bye kale chips) and Romeo is doing a wild dance that Hillary does not like ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt inappropriate, just lots of screaming and flailing:
   * Hilz: (looking aggravated) *‚ÄúStop. All those things you‚Äôre learning at camp, just stop.‚Äù*
   * Romeo: *‚ÄúNot camp, it‚Äôs YouTube‚Äù*
   * Hilz: *‚ÄúYeah, YouTube. YouTube is like‚Ä¶‚Äù* (shakes her head). Note: there is something called YouTube Kids where parents can set viewing parameters and block regular YouTube. I‚Äôm pretty sure Hillary has no clue about this.
   * Carmen: *‚ÄúYouTube shorts! I started watching PG-13 movies when I was like 6.‚Äù*
   * Romeo: *‚ÄúWait, what about Borat?‚Äù*
   * Hilz: *‚ÄúYou have not seen Borat!‚Äù* ¬†

[How does she not know what her kids watch?](https://preview.redd.it/61tkyntnqvve1.png?width=399&format=png&auto=webp&s=72bd7a767c19f43e25ca66367dec592bf48fe149)

o¬†¬† Carmen: (laughing) *‚ÄúYes, we have! It was all dad‚Äôs idea‚Äù* Cut to kids in the Sky Dungeon talking to producers where Leo is saying *‚Äúdad lets us watch movies all night‚Äù* as he spills a Spindrift on their white rug

o¬†¬† Hilz: *‚ÄúI think part of the thing is having an actor for a, a dad, or a parent‚Äù*

o¬†¬† Couch Hilz: *‚ÄúAlec and I are very different parents. I‚Äôll walk in and they‚Äôre watching movie, and I freak out and I say that‚Äôs not appropriate and they‚Äôre, mom, like we‚Äôve already watched it three times!‚Äù* (laughs) *‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm like argh! Don‚Äôt do that!‚Äù*

[Possibly my favorite picture from this whole show.](https://preview.redd.it/xxr6we1tqvve1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3110abd309515821ac5eb1b4aab615d3346253f)

* Hilz: (asking kids) *‚ÄúDo you guys think that you guys are gonna be all messed up cuz daddy lets you watch these things?‚Äù* Carmen: *‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù*
* Alec conveniently calls and Hillary says to him: *‚ÄúYou showed the kids Borat?‚Äù I know they can‚Äôt unsee it. Can you stop showing them things? Ok I appreciate that it‚Äôs funny, but it would also be funny \[when they‚Äôre\] 15!‚Äù*
* Carmen: *‚ÄúBy the way, dad showed me Borat when I was like 5.‚Äù* Cut to a couch interview with Carmen with crew walking around behind her so I think it was a let‚Äôs keep this kid out of our hair type of a thing. She shares that Alec let her watch *Working Moms* when she was 9, *Insatiable* when she was 6, and has watched *Orange is the New Black* and *‚Äúa lot worse‚Äù* without Hillary knowing. ¬†Maybe Hilz was out exercising to be a better and more involved parent while Carmen was doing all of this. This is a good time to note that Carmen is wearing a huge beige padded bra in this scene that comes most all the way of out of her little tank top. Just sayin.
* **Maril√∫ joins them on the porch, and they talk about how she will be starting at the same school as Carmen:**
   * **Carmen:** ***‚ÄúCan I visit you in your classroom every day? I wanna say hi to all your fake friends.‚Äù***
   * **ML: (upset)** ***‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not fake. Carmen, you‚Äôre a bitch. Bitch.‚Äù*** **ML kicks Carmen. No bleeping from TLC, just a four-year-old talking like this as her mom and sister giggle uproariously.**

**Preparing for Carmen‚Äôs Birthday**

* Sad violin music plays while a Hillary voiceover glitches and channels Charo‚Äôs accent while talking about how grounded Carmen is and how hard the past years have been on year because she the oldest and understands the most.
* As Hillary stands around while the kids play on the play structure, Rafa does a cool flip on a swing and yells to the camera crew, ‚Äú*who caught that?‚Äù* ¬†Not his clueless mom who is like, what? And not his clueless dad who sits in the outdoor living area talking to his assistant on the phone. ¬†
* Frumpy Couch Alec says he misses acting but wants it to be new and challenging (and also convenient and comfortable, like, say, having a camera crew record you sitting and talking on the phone).
* Mechanic Couch Hillary says that Alec has been offered a few movies he‚Äôs excited about and his hesitancy about continuing to act is just part of his personality because he goes back and forth on everything. TLC helpfully cuts to Alec throwing a hissy fit with Dr. Curly Fries saying, *‚ÄúI do not want to go back to the life I had‚Äù* and a lady at the organic farm they visited asking *‚Äúyou‚Äôre an actor, right?‚Äù* and Alec responding, *‚ÄúI used to be, not anymore.‚Äù* ¬†Basically, Hillary brushes this off and says of course Alec will act again, like there was ever any doubt.
* Hilz shares that as summer winds down, Alec will be exploring new acting projects, and she is writing a book. The whole show is designed to launch both these things but she is oh so casual about it all.
* Alec and Carmen have a couch interview where Carmen whines hard about how much she hates school. Rafa reveals in an individual interview that he hates school, too. Alec reminisces about Carmen lighting the tree that Rockefeller Center which she doesn‚Äôt remember and she obnoxiously name drops some famous people and she shoves Alec pretty darned hard as he teases her.

**Alec and Hillary and the New Bewbs Go Boating**

* After berating Alec for telling the crew *‚Äúthis the East Hampton marina‚Ä¶‚Äù* and cutting in sniping *‚Äúthis is not a history lesson!‚Äù* Couch Hilz observes that ‚Äú*Alec is from Long Island and Long Island has a very nautical culture to it.‚Äù* Sigh.
* She tries to spay him with sunscreen while prattling on and he actually says *‚Äúshhhh‚Äù* bc she‚Äôs such a rabid chihuahua about it. She clearly has never heard of sunscreen sticks made especially for the face.

[I don't know one person who sprays their face like this. ](https://preview.redd.it/ouyix99irvve1.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=b14e00ce3fa16d70cff29ed91d64c796578f351a)

* Hilz tells a whole story about how they got stuck in the sand while boating when they were dating and they had sex in the boat while waiting for a tow. Alec helpfully says, *‚ÄúHilaria is the most smoking hot woman in the world‚Äù* and then impersonates Kathleen Turner saying how happy she was to be alone after her divorce. He notes that unlike Kathleen, he doesn‚Äôt want to be alone because he craves companionship. My guy, don‚Äôt you want to stab your ears listening to her voice? Can you get a dog and a high class call girl for companionship?
* They talk about their age gap ‚Äì he went to prom in 1976, and she was born in 1984, and they work hard to show what a good time they‚Äôre having. She puts her arms around him, and he says, *‚Äúdon‚Äôt choke me, save that for later.‚Äù* Ewwwwww.

[Not their best  looks.](https://preview.redd.it/o9xl3yuqrvve1.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=ceb2ca10ca22ab2ed7dd746430dc5843cdfb3bf2)

**""2 Days ‚ÄòTil Manhattan‚Ä¶""/Carmen's Birthday**

* They‚Äôre in their backyard and Alec‚Äôs assistant, Emily, is telling him (but really telling us) he has dinner scheduled at Lorne Michael‚Äôs house that Sunday. Cut to couch Alec and Hillary going on and on about how much they loooooove Lorne and his wife and how they‚Äôve spent Thanksgiving with them. Something tells me this was a one-time thing.
* It‚Äôs Carmen‚Äôs birthday so Hillary calls out to her kid who is on the middle of playing\*, ‚ÄúLeo,\* ¬ø\*podemos hacer una carta para Carmen?‚Äù(\*Leo, can we make a card for Carmen?) Except the word for card is not *carta*, it‚Äôs *tarjeta.* ¬†She defaulted to a false cognate and Jaysus frickin yellow penguins, education was wasted on this woman.
* Cut to videos of Carmen speaking Spanish as a toddler and generally being cute.
* Emily shows up with balloons and Hillary squeals in full accent *‚ÄúEmily brot thee parteee!‚Äù* Carmen walks over with her buddy Fleur and maybe TLC edited out the part where she thanked Emily. Yeah, that must be it.

[The whole scene was just about Hilz wearing this dress. ](https://preview.redd.it/jwxc6xvwrvve1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=8306360e004e235a8e8b33a33a4dc9eceb4881c2)

* Producer: *‚ÄúDoes it feel like it‚Äôs been 11 years since you had her?‚Äù* ¬†Hard-hitting journalism, this ain‚Äôt.
* Hillary: *‚ÄúYeah, it feels like it‚Äôs been eleven years because I can‚Äôt remember with that muscle memory what it‚Äôs like to not be a mom. I think so much has happened, like the six siblings that came after that. So it definitely feels like it‚Äôs been eleven years.‚Äù* Sometimes when I realize how dumb Hillary is, I think there is karmic justice because imagine the torture for a pseudo intellectual like Alec to be married to this broad with the brains of an ice cube and a mean streak to boot.
* They have chocolate cake and there‚Äôs lots of chaos while Alec says, *‚Äúwelcome to Carmen‚Äôs 12th birthday party‚Äù* (immediately bringing to mind him screaming at Ireland *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a damn that you‚Äôre 12 years old or 11 years old or that you‚Äôre a child‚Äù)* as Hillary climbs on furniture to take pictures while squalling *‚Äúsay Baldwinitos!‚Äù*¬†

**Another Meal Out**

* Alec and Hillary have dinner at a restaurant called The 1770 House and the jokes about their shared colonial heritage just write themselves themselves. Spanish grandma who?
* Couch Alec says he‚Äôll never forget this summer that they all spent together and gives us this gem, *‚ÄúNow that this is over, I‚Äôm ready for us to go and live.‚Äù* So Halyna Hutchins‚Äôs death is reduced to a mere blip in their fun-filled summer ‚Äì they are ready for bigger and better, onward and upward, good vibes only!
* Hillary's gem is, *‚ÄúWe eat out all the time and I think it‚Äôs one of the amazing things that‚Äôs allowed us to stay very strong through ¬†so many years and so many experiences, being able to share a meal with each other and talking and connecting.‚Äù* ¬†Pepinos, we‚Äôve been doing relationships all wrong. It‚Äôs the eating out that keeps couples connected!

* Here‚Äôs Hilly‚Äôs summary of the summer: *‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know what was up or down or left or right, then we had that crazy week* (otherwise known as a miscarriage of justice? Gotcha) *then we come back. Now we are a month away and I don‚Äôt know about¬† you but I feel much more settled and stronger, I feel Iike I can think clearer.‚Äù* If this is her thinking clearly, I shudder to think what was happening before.
* Couch Alec: *‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs gonna take me a while to get this out of my system. All this last¬† year I was really, really down, I just ran out of energy, I mean I‚Äôm 66 years old. We went down there and had the trial and when it was over, it was like, I wanna go to bed for a month. But you can‚Äôt press pause, there‚Äôs no pause button in life, there‚Äôs no reverse button, it only goes forward.‚Äù*
* Restaurant Hilz: *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go backwards, I only want to go forward, I only want to lean into the positivity, I only want to lean into opportunity, because there are so many people out there who want good, there are so many good people out there‚Ä¶‚Äù*
* Alec: *‚ÄúAre there?‚Äù*
* Hilz: *‚ÄúYes there are ‚Äì no! That‚Äôs where we can‚Äôt let these people distort the reality.‚Äù* ¬†

[I felt a little called out.](https://preview.redd.it/v8ltsljxsvve1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cfed5fa5e03126007481b323468d82feb74868a)

* ¬†Hilz looks at her phone and she has 18 messages from Carmen. She calls her and says *‚Äúestamos filmando‚Äù* (we‚Äôre filming) and turns the camera to show Carmen the set up.
* Anywho, there was no emergency, just Carmen wanting attention - which is ok, she's a kid, but Hillary notes that *‚Äúit‚Äôs almost impossible to have an uninterrupted conversation‚Äù* because of Carmen. Cut to scenes of Hillary recording for the show and Carmen blowing up her phone. Alec seems decidedly unamused.
* Alec talks about SNL and The Hunt for Red October and how impressed he was by Sean Connery and how he commanded respect on set. Hilz opines that Alec is now that seasoned actor that fellow actors look up to. Alec comments he‚Äôs lucky to have met her. Sir, you have paid through the nose for every nice thing Hilz says to you on camera.
* Producer to Couch Hilz: *‚Äúwhat‚Äôs engraved in your rings again?‚Äù* Hillary answers with alacrity,*‚ÄúSomos un buen equipo, we‚Äôre a good team.‚Äù* Most Spanish speakers would say *‚Äúhacemos un buen equipo‚Äù* but I guess when you‚Äôre appropriating a language you make the rules. She adds that they now say *‚Äúsomos el mejor equipo, we‚Äôre the best team.‚Äù* I would add *‚Äúson un par de imb√©ciles‚Äù,* but that might be a lot to engrave on a ring.
* They end the scene with a kiss that seared my retinas.

**‚ÄúSix Weeks Later‚Äù**

* It‚Äôs 7:20 a.m. and they‚Äôre getting ready for school back in NYC but if the caption read ‚Äúfire drill‚Äù I would believe it ‚Äì kids are running around crying and screaming and it‚Äôs free-for-all.
* Alec says he‚Äôs ‚Äúelated‚Äù to be back in the city ¬†weirdly insisting ‚Äúwe live here, not there‚Äù (the Hamptons). M'kay.
* Alec is waiting downstairs to take the kids to school and notes that they call this time ‚Äúthe Carmen hour‚Äù because Carmen spends so much time primping and putting makeup on that they are late to school virtually every day. Hillary claims things are awesome and they kids are doing their homework and they have friends. She asks Carmen in the car what she‚Äôs looking forward to at school and Carmen replies, *‚Äúrecess and gossip.‚Äù* Rafa replies *‚Äúrecess‚Äù* to the same question. Red flags, anyone?
* Hilz notes *‚Äúwhen the tragedy happened I realized that I really had to be the rock in our home, but I really hope that after holding everything together for so long for everybody that I can out my oxygen mask on now. I have to to work on my book and Alec is going to be on SNL.‚Äù* Cut to the book cover photoshoot.

* Back in the apartment Alec is holding Ilaria and Hillary aks her *‚Äúoye beb√©,* ¬ø*c√≥mo te llamas?‚Äù* (what‚Äôs your name?) and the child replies ‚ÄúBoss‚Äù except that Hillary teaches her to say it with a Spanish accent. Holy smokes, friends, these kids are doomed.
* Frumpy Couch Alec says that he would love an eighth baby and makes this face which would cause most fallopian tubes to tie themselves into knots:

* They end with a two minute blooper reel is neither funny nor cute but obviously they all think it is ‚Äì producers are laughing hysterically and Alec is doing impressions, and it could not end soon enough for me.

**Final Ready Bat Thoughts**

There are always going to be weird sycophants online that tell Alec and Hillary they‚Äôre great. Here at Fraudwin Headquarters, we‚Äôre a little more discerning. What most of us saw over the course of these 8 episodes was a dysfunctional relationship with Alec playing a twisted Daddy Warbucks to his infantilized trophy wife who has convinced him that her stupid accent/affectation is not only normal but cute.

Some things that I found especially disturbing or caught me off guard:

* The cursing! I was shocked to my core to hear the youngest two girls engaging in hardcore cursing and everybody laughing about it.
* Alec doesn‚Äôt bathe much according to Carmen. Wut?
* Hillary can‚Äôt sit in a chair with her feet of the floor, but to be fair, how else would we gauge how smoll she is?
* Everything about Carmen: the clothes, the makeup, the nails, the attitude, the obsessive texting and calling her mother, the way she treats Alec with disdain. ¬†¬†
* The dog and cat poo everywhere ‚Äì I cannot wrap my head around this.
* The cheap, tacky gifts Hillary gave Alec for their anniversary while she got Mikimoto pearls she will probably never wear again.
* How oddly subdued Raf is compared to all the other kids.
* At least one kid smacking the nanny ¬†- what the actual hell?
* Hillary‚Äôs cockamamie ‚Äúcode-switching‚Äù justification of her ludicrous accent. ¬†

God save the kids from the crappy parenting they‚Äôre subjected to and God save us from Hillary‚Äôs influencer arc on TikTok.

I have never been so happy to see the return of Sister Wives on TLC ‚Äì they‚Äôre weird AF but I like my crazy without a side order of cultural appropriation or children cussing a blue streak, so that‚Äôs where I‚Äôll be on Sunday nights now that my self-imposed purgatory is over!

Also posting this on a throwaway account for privacy reasons. Me and my husband have been together for 9 years and I‚Äôm honestly stunned by the past months events. I‚Äôm incredibly distraught and can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm overreacting or not. My husband, let‚Äôs call him mark, has never been the greatest husband by any means, but I never thought he was terrible. He was extremely traditional, and he treated me better than anyone I‚Äôd ever been with before and in a way, I let that overshadow all the red flags I‚Äôm finally starting to notice. At first it was nothing major, just what I assumed to be him being a nonchalant person that didn‚Äôt care much for a lot of things. He never brought me flowers, never celebrated my birthday with me besides a weak ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù and a kiss before it was back to the day as normal. And with him being so traditional, I was basically forced into the jobless housewife role the day we moved in together, I was expected to clean, cook, and be the perfect housewife for him while he sat around doing nothing. But believe it or not, this was better than what I‚Äôd had before him, so I let it slide. Well a year ago we decided we were going to try for a baby, having a baby has been my dream since I was a child so naturally I was excited. And naturally for him, he didn‚Äôt care much, but we still tried, and skipping all the boring bits and our extremely underwhelming and unfulfilling sex, it finally happened. I remember the day I tested positive like it was yesterday, it was the happiest moment of my life and I immediately ran to mark with the good news. His reaction, as expected was not exactly what I hoped for. A simple and unenthusiastic ‚Äúreally? Thats great babe‚Äù and a kiss had my mood almost instantly deflated. But even he couldn‚Äôt entirely bring me down that day, I was expecting a happy and complication free pregnancy and a healthy baby 9 months from now and I couldn‚Äôt have been happier. The first few weeks were fine, good even. It wasn‚Äôt until week 10 when shit hit the fan. I noticed I was cramping pretty bad, and wasn‚Äôt thinking much about it since I was pregnant, then came the blood. Small bits here and there in my panties, then spots in my urine, so I brought it up with mark, who thought it was nothing and advised I don‚Äôt go to the hospital and stay home to make us dinner. I listened and began working on dinner when the cramps became substantially worse, and I decided I needed to go to the hospital and ensure everything was ok. I convinced mark to drive me, albeit begrudgingly, and I‚Äôm not even sure if I can talk about what happened that night as I still haven‚Äôt been able to fully process it. We checked into the ER and after waiting painstakingly, we finally get called back. They do the routine checks and ask about my symptoms, then perform a transabdominal ultrasound that comes back clear, then sent me for a transvaginal ultrasound. It felt like we waited for years before the results came back. I was miscarrying. In that moment I felt my entire life shattering around me, and I haven‚Äôt been the same. I opted for the pill, hoping to have a supportive husband through this terrible time. But he simply wasn‚Äôt, he was upset at first but after a couple days it seemed he got over it. I will never forget what he told me the day my baby passed from my body. I was sobbing uncontrollably and he told me ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no reason to be this upset right now, it wasn‚Äôt even fully a baby‚Äù when I tell you I didn‚Äôt even know how to respond to that. I just rolled over in bed and cried myself to sleep. It‚Äôs been three months since then with no other complications besides my shattered mental health and he acts like nothing ever happened, and it tears me apart. I was still expected to perform my housewife duties and I couldn‚Äôt stand it, I couldn‚Äôt stand him. Sitting on that damn couch all day long besides when he‚Äôs working or eating the food I cook him, while I clean up after him, make him meals, all while trying to cope with my miscarriage. With so many things bubbling up inside of me I guess what happened next should‚Äôve been expected. It was a normal Friday, I, wallowing in my pain and grief alone while slaving away cleaning the kitchen and living room, and him watching tv eating a bag of chips and drinking a coke, in a glass. He had his feet up on the coffee table looking at his phone, I had just finished cleaning and vacuuming the living room mind you. He moves his feet off the table and spills his coke all over the carpet. I look at him, expecting him to apologize and get up to clean it, when he instead looks me in the eyes and asks ‚Äúwell, can you clean that up?‚Äù And that was it for me. All the pain, the loneliness, the grief I had felt poured out in that very moment. I broke down crying, screaming at him that I hate him, how I wish I never married him, how he‚Äôs ruined my life and made me into a shell of myself. I let it all out, over a spilt glass. I was so distraught I barely even noticed his shocked reaction before i told him i wanted a divorce and stormed out of the house. I called my mom, sobbing and begging to come over and have been staying with her since as I try to clear my mind and think on how I want to approach this. He has been blowing up my phone all day long with texts and calls and I haven‚Äôt returned any of them or even looked at his texts.

It‚Äôs not important what I do. It‚Äôs one of those jobs where the title sounds like it means something, but when you try to explain it, people nod too fast.

The kind of job with monitors that stay on even when you clock out. The kind of office with no clocks, but a breakroom full of energy drinks. You know the type.

Anyway. I take the elevator every morning.  
Same time. Same button. Same man.

He's always already inside.

Thin tie. Tan skin like it‚Äôs been freshly shaved. Hair neatly parted, a little too shiny. He stands perfectly still in the back right corner, both hands folded in front like he‚Äôs praying without the knees. And as soon as I step in, he says it:

‚ÄúStill sure you want this?‚Äù

I say ‚Äúyes‚Äù like a reflex. Not even thinking.  
He smiles ‚Äî not friendly, not weird. Just fixed.  
And we ride.

19 floors. Quiet hum. The kind of silence that feels‚Ä¶ intentional. Like the elevator‚Äôs holding its breath.  
I don‚Äôt look at him. He doesn‚Äôt move.  
When we hit 19, the door slides open and I step out.

I never hear him leave.

It started three weeks into the job.  
At first, I assumed he was some kind of exec ‚Äî those ones from other branches who float in to sit on empty chairs and drink from glass mugs you‚Äôre not allowed to touch.  
But no one talks about him.  
Not once have I heard, ‚ÄúOh, that guy from the elevator,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs from HR.‚Äù  
Nothing.

I asked once.  
Lauren from Data just looked confused. ‚ÄúWhich elevator?‚Äù  
There‚Äôs only one.

I guess the thing that really gets me is: I never saw him enter.  
Never caught him walking into the building. Never passed him in the lobby.  
He‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ already there.  
Every morning.

‚ÄúStill sure you want this?‚Äù  
Yes.  
Always yes.  
What else would I say?

I had another offer, you know.  
Back when I was job hunting, I had two emails. Two PDFs. One had better hours, worse pay. One was this.  
Guess which one I opened first. Guess which one I told myself ‚Äúmade more sense.‚Äù  
Guess which one had a reply window that ‚Äúexpired‚Äù after fifteen minutes.

Still. I said yes.

Next morning, the elevator stutters halfway up.

Not violently ‚Äî just a glitch. A hiccup in the climb.  
The kind of jolt that makes your stomach pause before your brain catches on.  
I glance at the panel. We‚Äôre between 6 and 7. Lights overhead flicker ‚Äî like someone's playing with a dimmer switch in slow motion. Everything dulls out. The colors in my reflection go flat. I look like an old photo.

Then it smooths out. Like nothing happened.

Except the man‚Äôs smile has cracked.

Not gone. Just‚Ä¶ wrong. Crooked at the edges. Like he forgot how to hold it.

And for the first time in weeks, I actually look at him.  
The lines under his eyes. The way his suit doesn't wrinkle. The way his shoes didn‚Äôt cast shadows.  
He turns to me ‚Äî not a lot, just a slight lean, just enough to let the elevator feel smaller.

‚ÄúStill sure you want this?‚Äù

Same words.  
But not the same voice.  
It sounds... tired. Not like he‚Äôs offering anymore. Like he‚Äôs asking for real.

Like I could say no.

I turn to the buttons. My thumb goes for 19. Muscle memory.  
Except‚Äî

They're gone.  
Every floor. Every number.  
Just one button now. Dead center. Lit up soft and warm.

**YES**

I stare at it.  
It pulses.  
Not blinking ‚Äî breathing.

Behind me, he exhales through his nose.  
Like he already knows.

I press it. Of course I do.

The doors open.

It‚Äôs the office.  
But broken.  
The carpet's wet ‚Äî not puddled, but soggy. I step out and my shoe sinks half an inch. Cold climbs my sock. It smells like mold and printer ink and something burned.  
No lights on. Just daylight bleeding in from somewhere too far away.

Every monitor is blank. Every swivel chair is turned the wrong way.

It‚Äôs my floor ‚Äî the layout, the windows ‚Äî but it feels like someone rebuilt it from memory.  
A dream of what my job should look like.

No one is here.

No voices. No tapping keyboards.  
Just that buzzing silence you only hear in waiting rooms and places that shouldn‚Äôt be empty.

There‚Äôs a desk up ahead. Mine, I think. Or maybe the one I had at the last place.  
Doesn‚Äôt matter.

On it: a single piece of paper.  
Crisp. White. Perfectly centered.

It‚Äôs my resume.

Same font. Same lie about ""team synergy.""  
Same typo I didn‚Äôt catch ‚Äî *""proficient in time managment.""*  
And in the bottom corner: a coffee ring. Faded brown. The exact shape of the thermos I spilled during my second interview.

I haven‚Äôt seen this paper in months.  
I never printed it. Not after that day.

I run a finger over the stain. It smudges.

**Fresh.**

Then the elevator dings again.  
Louder this time. Closer.

I turn.

He‚Äôs inside, just like before.  
Same corner. Same hands clasped.  
But he‚Äôs not smiling.

That‚Äôs the first thing I notice. His mouth is flat. Jaw tight like it‚Äôs bracing for something.  
He doesn‚Äôt nod. Doesn‚Äôt motion.  
Just waits.

The light inside looks dimmer than it should be.

I step in.

The doors close.

There are no buttons anymore. No YES, no numbers, nothing.  
Just the two of us.

We rise.

The hum is softer now. Muffled, like the walls are padded in something thick and wet. I can feel the motion, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going up.  
Not exactly.

He doesn‚Äôt move. Doesn‚Äôt speak.

Not until we hit somewhere in-between.  
And then ‚Äî he turns.

Just his head.

His eyes find mine.  
There‚Äôs something behind them I don‚Äôt think was there before.

Something human.

‚ÄúStill sure you want this?‚Äù

Same words.

But this time, I hesitate.

Not long. But enough to feel it.

I think about the resume. The ring. The other offer.  
The way the fake office smelled like it remembered me.

I think about how many times I‚Äôve said yes without thinking.

How maybe this time matters more than I want it to.

I nod.  
And say it.

**‚ÄúYes.‚Äù**

He closes his eyes.

And for a second, he looks‚Ä¶ relieved.  
Not happy. Just like someone who finally dropped a weight they‚Äôve been carrying too long.

The elevator stops.

**Floor 19.**

Lights on.  
The real floor this time. The right one.  
People are moving. Talking. Tapping keys. I hear someone laugh at a Slack message.  
It smells like cheap coffee and fabric cubicle walls.

I step out. The carpet is dry.

Everything is normal.

**Too normal.**

I walk to my desk.  
My real desk.

Monitor glowing. Water bottle exactly where I left it.  
Post-it notes in three colors. My inbox blinking politely.

And on the keyboard:

A sticky note. Yellow.  
Sharp black ink.

**You said yes.**  
**Again.**

I sit down.  
Click into the day. Maybe nothing happened.

But I glance at the elevator.  
Just once.

And then I look back at the screen.  
The inbox loads. My hands rest on the keys.

Since I met my ex, she always avoided showing up on video calls, saying her hair was messy. Later, she revealed that she had autism. Our conversations were mostly one-sided, and whenever we planned to meet, she often canceled ‚Äî like the time she said she had hurt her leg.

She told me her ex had abandoned her, that she had been replaced by another guy, and she used to say I treated her differently after learning about her autism. When I got mugged and almost lost her number, I noticed she was indifferent, saying she wouldn‚Äôt text me unless I messaged her first.

She often talked about her cats and got really upset when a cousin mentioned that she used to drink with her ex. When I invited her to the movies, she refused at first, saying she was too shy, but later accepted. After the date ‚Äî where we kissed and spent the afternoon together ‚Äî she started pulling away again. She would hide her phone from me and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

There was a time when her sister dropped her off at my place, and I commented that she didn‚Äôt go out with me because she was ""being difficult"" ‚Äî she got really mad. Another time, while we were playing a game, I criticized it and she stopped playing. Despite some good moments, like when she gave me chocolate, right after that she would talk about breaking up.

She invited me to a party, later said she wasn‚Äôt going anymore, and in the end changed her mind. I asked if I could arrive earlier, but she made it clear I should only arrive at 6 PM. When I got there earlier, her sister saw me on the street and asked me to come up. At the party, she introduced me as her boyfriend, but at some point randomly joked, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs download an app to find you a hot girl.‚Äù

After that, we argued, I broke up with her, she cried and blocked me. Later, she sent me a message saying she missed me. We started talking again, but I ended up finding her on a dating app. When I confronted her, she said she was looking for a friend‚Äôs ex.

Even so, I told her I loved her. She invited me to her mother‚Äôs birthday, but I didn‚Äôt go. Her mom later called asking if I loved her, and even invited me over for coffee. When we talked again, she told me her dad was mad at me. I felt bad, vented online, and she saw it. She told me I had lied and used her, that she only acted the way she did because she was insecure and autistic, said she had prayed for me every day, and then blocked me for good.",3,1745109285.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False
1k3ahg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1k3ahg1/long_review_of_alkemia_hexennacht_pineward_pulp/,"Long review of Alkemia, Hexennacht, Pineward, Pulp, & Solstice Scents from someone new to indies!","Hello all! This is my first time posting here although I‚Äôve spent the past few months lurking and falling down an absolute rabbit hole reading reviews here. I would consider myself a fragrance noob, I started wearing perfume/cologne regularly around 8 years ago but I‚Äôve had the same three bottles since then and none were indie. I generally only wear fragrance on special occasions because it‚Äôs so cost prohibitive which is part of how they‚Äôve lasted so long lol. My signature scent has always been V&R‚Äôs Spicebomb which I still adore and will likely cling to forever, but besides that they only other perfumes I have are a discontinued cheapie from Target that‚Äôs basically just oakmoss (big love) and Fragonard‚Äôs Ile d‚Äôamour (which I liked when I bought it 13 years ago, but now find headache inducing and way too floral, sigh). Thanks to all the lovely reviews and comments from folks here on this sub, I decided to branch out a little and try out some indies! üòä I‚Äôm very big on atmospheric scents and my strategy with sampling was to look for ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù scents from multiple houses to try and see what works best with my skin chemistry as well as anything unique looking that caught my eye! Now for some basic info that will hopefully provide some insight into my impressions:

**Likes:** woody and forest-y scents like pine/fir/cedar/etc, petrichor and other earthy dirty green scents, dirt!, ozone, incense & resins,¬† brine-y ocean scents, amber, sandalwood, patchouli, oakmoss, wet pavement/cement, metallic scents, spices, peppers, some citrus, ""masculine"" scents

**Dislikes:** overly ""feminine"" scents, gourmands (it seems like these are tremendously popular so that‚Äôs my b lol, I do enjoy some vanilla/honey on occasion when it‚Äôs supporting other non-gourmand notes!), florals, anything overly sweet or cloying. I‚Äôd also like to say it‚Äôs not that I hate these scents, I actually quite enjoy smelling these, it‚Äôs just that these are not the vibe I‚Äôm trying to bring to the function lol. I want to smell like an evil forest creature. The only note I absolutely loathe is powder!!

**Notes about the sampling process:** I let everything rest at least two weeks in a dark cupboard kept under 70 degrees (I live in a cold, humid place and it never gets above the mid 60s here even in the summer so it‚Äôs pretty temperate and I only mention that because my house doesn‚Äôt have heating lol). Some sample sets got to rest for a full month. For oils, I sampled by doing one splash on my wrist and one splash on my neck. EDPs got one spray on the neck and one spray on the wrist. I tend to go noseblind after a while but asked my partner if they could still smell me every few hours. Alkemia and Pineward got 1 month of rest, everything else got 2-3 weeks.

**What I‚Äôm after:** a photorealistic cemetery scent (wet dirt/wet pavement) that has decent longevity (sillage is a bonus). I‚Äôm also interested in other foresty/loamy/challenging atmospherics. In general, I want a perfume that is STRONG and a BEAST. If I‚Äôm spending all that money on a full size bottle I want that shit to be worth it! ‚òπ Spicebomb has spoiled me because it literally never fades on my skin and the projection is insane (although I‚Äôm less concerned with that, I‚Äôm not trying to choke anyone out lol), I know I have to re-adjust my expectations with indies, but I‚Äôd like at least 6 hours, ideally 8 out of an application!

**Perfumes I‚Äôd like to try but haven‚Äôt yet:** BPAL‚Äôs Yorick, Amorphous/Black Baccara‚Äôs Cemetery Moss, Fantome‚Äôs Bune, Fantome‚Äôs Baba Yaga, Olympic Orchid‚Äôs Kingston Ferry. (If anyone here has experience with these fragrances I‚Äôd love to hear it!)

Alphabetical by house and each house‚Äôs scents are also alphabetized.

**ALKEMIA**

**Arabesque:** *sandalwoods, precious Egyptian kyphi, sweet orris root, benzoin resin, cassia, and blessed spikenard.* I‚Äôm very fond of this one and will likely pick up a bigger bottle! My nose isn‚Äôt super well trained so the only thing I really recognize is the sandalwood but it‚Äôs so creamy and delicious and not overpowering on me that I love smelling it. This is not a challenging or atmospheric perfume at all, I would consider this very safe, but it‚Äôs so well done and very comforting. Also as a huge bonus, even though it has several notes that fall into the powdery family, it never goes powdery on me :‚Äô) just delightfully creamy. The longevity on me was a good 6-8 hours, sillage is also good enough that my partner could smell it from a few feet away hours after applying.

**Book of Shadows:** *heavy parchment paper, ancient iron oak gall ink, crumbling leather bindings, and wafts of rare incenses*. I‚Äôve always been curious about ‚Äòbook‚Äô scents so I wanted to give this one a whirl. On my skin I found this to be extremely strong and almost overwhelming, every time I thought surely it would fade and mellow out I kept getting hit with another wave of smelling it. I did get the book scent but there was also something oddly sweet and almost cloying to it, which I assume is a mix of the leather and incenses, possibly the ink? I did enjoy it and will finish the sample, but this is definitely going to be an every once in a while scent for me given how strong I found it. Great longevity and moderate projection.

**Gothique:** *Somalian frankincense, styrax benzoin, Arabian myrrh, cassia, spikenard, canella, Liquidambar orientalis, labdanum, Atlas cedar, and vetiver.* Another safe & classic type of fragrance that I was curious about. I was raised in a catholic household so this a very nostalgic scent for me and does indeed smell like mass lol. This was another one with good longevity and sillage on me! My partner could smell it a few feet away and I felt like I got a good 6+ hours of wear out of it. I will probably pick up a bigger bottle of this at some point.

**Lilacs Along the Winding Drive**: *Lilac bushes heavy and purple with blooms, a gentle breeze after light spring rain, a dusty pebbled driveway, a slightly rusty porch swing, and a small handful of late blooming violets.* This was included as a surprise free sample in my order, but I had previously heard of it and was curious about it as someone on this sub said it might be a good dupe for Heretic‚Äôs Nosferatu if layered with St. Louis Cemetery No. 1. Now that I‚Äôve tried both of those from Alkemia as well as the actual Nosferatu perfume, I can safely say layering them does NOT produce a dupe lol. I‚Äôve seen reviews of this scent saying it goes soapy on a lot of people. Thankfully on me it‚Äôs not soapy, although as I‚Äôm not interested in florals, it wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea, although I did very much enjoy trying it and will finish the sample eventually. It smells like an old lady perfume in the most complimentary way. My grandmother died when I was very young and I have a few small (empty) antique perfume decanters from her and this scent smells exactly like the residue in them. A very powerful scent memory for me and one I enjoy having the opportunity to experience. Longevity was on the shorter side and sillage was intimate.

**Love Flight of a Candy Heart:** *pink cotton candy, candy orange slices, red licorice, bergamot, pineapple, fresh passionfruit, green figs, vanilla musk, pink pepper, oleander, freesia, Panama rose, frangipani, green coconut water, and cashmere musk.* Another surprise freebie in my order and sadly not to my taste at all, but certainly well done I think for those interested in this type of fragrance profile! The only way I can describe it is as the kind of perfume you would buy at Claire‚Äôs in 2008. I tried it on my skin out of curiosity and, like Book of Shadows, it was crazy strong and lasted absolutely forever! By the end of the day it was getting close to headache territory for me lol.

**Silver Sky:** *rainwater musk, oceanic grey amber, muget, daffodil, silver needle tea, galbanum, and white cedar.* Decided to try this one since I‚Äôm a hunt for a nice petrichor scent and was unsure if I should try this one or Mist Becoming Rain. I did enjoy this scent but I didn‚Äôt find what I was looking for with it. On me it smells exactly like a classic men‚Äôs summertime cologne or aftershave. I‚Äôll finish the sample as it‚Äôs a clean and pleasant masculine scent, but I wasn‚Äôt heartbroken to see that Alkemia just announced they‚Äôre discontinuing this one. Poor longevity and sillage on me.

**St. Louis Cemetery No. 1***: Spanish moss, crumbling stone, old cement, red clay brick, and graveyard dirt.* This is it, this is the one that made me go down this rabbit hole in the first place. This is exactly what I was looking for, it‚Äôs bottled heaven. The wet pavement note is brisk and grungy and the soil note is divine. As fate would have it this is by far the weakest scent with the worst longevity & throw on me. It vanishes within 1-2 hours on me and my partner was never able to smell it without directly sniffing my neck. Super devastated but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs just because these types of notes are short lived in general? Everything else from Alkemia performed so well on me (besides the other aquatic) so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs their carrier oil, and I tried other similar scents from other houses and they were also short lived even if other samples from them had better longevity. I still plan on full-sizing this probably in the EDP format as I find the scent incredible and will be happy regardless with using it as an experience (but hoping the EDP form will have a smidge better longevity on me?)

**HEXENNACHT**

**L‚Äôair en hiver:** *dead leaves and frozen earth beneath a heavy blanket of snow, wintry air, leather boots, chimney smoke, stacked firewood, musc d'amande, clove bud, patchouli.* Woof, there‚Äôs that cloying dead leaf smell. In the bottle, all I get is the dead leaf note, and on my skin‚Ä¶all I get is the dead leaf note. Between that and the sweetness of the leather this was a disappointment for me. No smoke or wood at all. I was hoping with time, the sweetness would fade and give way to notes like the clove or patchouli (both of which I typically enjoy), but sadly they were no-shows on my skin. Sillage was very intimate and mercifully it faded within the hour, anymore and I fear this might‚Äôve been my first scrubber.

**The Exorcist:** *church incense, labdanum, golden copal, and religious tomes.* Another one I was picked as it seemed similar to Alkemia‚Äôs Gothique. Different and more ‚Äúsavory‚Äù (??), kind of like SS‚Äôs Monastic. For some reason out of all the Hex scents I tried this one was the faintest on me and while it has lots of notes I enjoy, I wasn‚Äôt as fond of this one. Sillage was very intimate and longevity about 4 hours.

**Fallen Angel:** *rain-soaked granite, mountain air, petrichor, creeping ivy, damp earth.* Was stoked to try this one as it seemed like another alt for St. Louis and it was extremely enjoyable! Definitely different, and it had a green scent that I can only describe as juicy? I didn‚Äôt get a whole lot of the wet granite on my skin, but it definitely had a nice petrichor flavor to it and when all the other notes faded, that juicy ivy/green smell stuck around. Sillage was intimate and longevity was about 4 hours.

**Graveyard:** *freshly overturned dirt, pine boxes, cedarwood.* ¬†I was really excited for this one as it seemed exactly up my alley! Sadly on my skin I couldn‚Äôt detect any dirt, this was all cedar, baby. I grew up in a house with full sized cedar closets and a large cedar chest that we kept our blankets in so it was definitely nostalgic lol. I really enjoy the scent of cedar so I‚Äôm not mad about it and look forward to wearing it again in the future. Sillage was intimate and as with many of the Hex scents I tried, longevity was about 4 hours.

**Mephistopheles:** *dead leaves, pine, cedar, fall air, laurel, balsam, smoke, clove bud, black patchouli, mushroom caps, dampened black soil.* I chose this one because the notes seemed like something Pineward would do, but sadly the dead leaf note was so cloying it overpowered everything else on me. After a little while the offending dead leaf note did start to fade unlike in L‚Äôair en hiver, and I did get some hints of the clove and patchouli! Oddly there were moments when I thought this one smelled almost like a cinnamon roll?? But I know that‚Äôs the clove just playing with me lol. No dirt or mushroom notes on me. Sillage was very intimate and longevity about 2 hours.

**The Space In Between:** *stratospheric air accord (ozone, chlorine), fresh air accord, rain, lily-of-the-valley, ambergris accord, ambroxan, dirt, geosmin, green musk, blue tansy.* Holy shit this one goes so crazy. I was very excited and intrigued to try this one based on the notes and it did not disappoint. I‚Äôd seen some reviews on this sub from people saying the chlorine was faint or took a few hours to show up, but on me it was ALL chlorine all the time it was wild. Out of the bottle and for a few seconds on my skin I could smell the amber-y and musky notes, but it immediately gave way to the chlorine and I felt like it only got stronger with time lol. This one only lasted around 4 or 5 hours on me before fading too significantly to really smell anymore and honestly it was kind of a relief when it did. I wouldn‚Äôt full size but I‚Äôm so glad I tried it because it was certainly an experience omg.

**PINEWARD**

**Coastal Veil:** *juniper berries,juniper needles, sea water, bladderwrack, coastal cypress, oyster mushroom, water pepper, blue gum eucalyptus, Pacific ambergris, Irish sea moss, sandalwood.* Had a hard time deciding on whether to sample this or Acadian. I‚Äôd still like to try Acadian at some point but I‚Äôm super happy with this. In addition to petrichor, I‚Äôm also on the hunt for a ‚Äútrue‚Äù sea scent that isn‚Äôt like a summery beach. I want a dark salty stormy beach on a rainy day in the middle of autumn!! This felt like what I was looking for and I really enjoyed sampling this! As with all aquatics on me, this faded pretty quickly and the sillage was pretty much just a skin scent, so I‚Äôm super bummed about that /: But it is a beautiful fragrance and I‚Äôll reach for the sample whenever I‚Äôm craving a quick hit of the coast. Longevity around 1-2 hours as a skin scent.

**Eldritch:** *Leather, Myrrh, patchouli, fir, oolong tea, opoponax, smoke, pine needles, oakmoss.* Really really love this one and I‚Äôm bummed it doesn‚Äôt last as long on me as Fanghorn otherwise I would be fullsizing! It definitely feels like it‚Äôs in the same ‚Äúfamily‚Äù as Fanghorn, but unlike Murkwood, it‚Äôs different enough that it feels unique and distinguishable. Unlike the leather in Funerie or leather notes I‚Äôve tried from other houses, this had quite an authentic leather scent to me. I‚Äôm not usually thrilled by super smoky scents, but the smoke was very subtle in this one on me. I didn‚Äôt find this challenging at all despite what the listing says. I hate to describe things as dark and mysterious because it‚Äôs so vague but here I think it‚Äôs fitting lol. As it fades it becomes more incense-y with a subtle but pleasing smokiness. I‚Äôm not really picking up the oolong or pine, but everything feels so well blended it‚Äôs hard for me to tell. Fanghorn only lasts about 4 hours on me but it‚Äôs in my face for those 4 hours, but Eldritch feels much weaker in comparison. I can smell it decently for the first hour but it really starts to diminish after that before disappearing completely. Longevity was around 2-3 hours as a skin scent.

**Fanghorn II:** *silver fir, moss, lichen, pine needles, wet soil, and damp vegetation.* ¬†Holy shit this is IT, this was made for me, I love it so much. This is the forest scent of my dreams and actually smells like going for a walk through damp woods. It smells like BO but if BO were sexy and delicious?? I wish I could bathe in this. Or eat it. Or both. The longevity isn‚Äôt great on me but I love this scent so much I don‚Äôt even care and will be picking up a bigger bottle! My partner also really liked this scent on me. It lasted around 4 hours with moderate/intimate sillage.

**Funerie:** *Morel mushroom, decayed rose, leather, tobacco, smoke, pineboard, incense, sweet myrrh, blood cedar, dried needles, rotting wood (oud).* Insane fragrance, so happy I tried it. On me, it legitimately smells like a doctor‚Äôs office?! Like exactly like my childhood pediatrician‚Äôs office. It reeks of commercial cleaning chemicals, it‚Äôs nuts. I‚Äôm not mad about it, I sampled this one because I wanted a unique experience and I sure f\*cking got it. This one ironically was also the one scent I got from Pineward that would not quit. My partner could smell it from a good distance and avoided me while I wore it lmfao. They also thought it smelled like an astringent doctor‚Äôs office. It also had the best staying power of all the Pineward scents I tried! I didn‚Äôt detect any of the mushroom or rose notes, I actually thought (once I forced myself to get past the chemical smell) that it smelled like the inside of a tannery. Like rotten leather on steroids. I‚Äôve seen lots of people saying they get the mushroom note though and some reviews that didn‚Äôt find this challenging at all! ¬†So cool how wildly different everyone‚Äôs skin chemistry is! Longevity was eternal and sillage was moderate!

**Murkwood:** *fir balsam, black hemlock, lapsang souchong, moss, incense, bitter myrrh.* On my skin this one felt extremely similar to Fanghorn but the longevity was a little less so while I‚Äôll enjoy finishing the sample I don‚Äôt expect to full size as Fanghorn ticks all my boxes. I personally really enjoy lapsang souchong tea but I couldn‚Äôt pick it up on my skin and this scent didn‚Äôt feel particularly smokey? Lasted around 3-4 hours as a skin scent.

**Shire:** *hay, oatmeal, hazelnut, bergamot, lavender, herbal tea, westfarthing leaf (tobacco), seed cake, jasmine, orris, and honey.* ¬†All right I know I‚Äôm not a gourmand girlie but I do have multiple LotR tattoos and am easily swayed by my love of hobbits so of course I couldn‚Äôt resist trying this. It smells delicious and true to the notes, and this is the closest I‚Äôve gotten to willingly wearing a gourmand lol. My skin really amped the oatmeal and hazelnuts with wisps of lavender, I wish I could eat this. Projection was sadly weak but it did stick around on my skin for most of the day so I enjoyed sniffing my wrist with this one.

**Tome:** *No listed notes as it was a surprise sample of an unreleased prototype, BUT I reached out to Pineward to offer my compliments and Nicholas Nilsson kindly replied and offered these comments on it! ‚ÄúThe scent itself draws inspiration from the actual chemistry behind the scent of old books mixed with some fantasy and contemporary notes inspired from bookshops (and bookshop coffee bars).‚Äù* THIS is the book scent I‚Äôve been dreaming of! I‚Äôm so happy this was thrown in as a sample!! I‚Äôd seen one or two mentions of this prototype on this sub so I was really hoping I might get a chance to try it and boy howdy did it deliver! On my skin it was not cloying at all and was very book-authentic and was what I wanted Alkemia‚Äôs Book of Shadows to be. I would happily full-size this if Pineward decides to do a full release! Longevity was great on me, it lasted basically the whole day, projection was intimate.

**PULP**

**Eagle Hill Cemetery:** *An ivy-covered mausoleum, old paving stones, cool damp soil, a creaky iron gate, faded bouquets, & the spark of a match freshly-lit to see your way.* I was super excited for this one as another potential alternative to Alkemia‚Äôs St. Louis Cemetery! The ivy is quite potent in this one and makes it distinct from the other wet soil scents I‚Äôve sampled here. I really enjoyed this and while the performance is similarly poor to Alkemia & SS‚Äôs petrichor scents, I would still consider picking up a bigger bottle. I‚Äôm sad that every time I‚Äôve checked Pulp‚Äôs website in the last month or so it‚Äôs been listed as out of stock, I‚Äôm really hoping they bring this one back!

**SOLSTICE SCENTS**

Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think SS‚Äôs carrier oil works well with my skin chemistry as I found each scent to have an identical, unpleasant odor underneath all the other notes ‚òπ the sillage and longevity were also nonexistent on me and vanished within an hour regardless of scent or notes. So these were all misses for me so I won‚Äôt really be reviewing them as such as I don‚Äôt want to put anybody off from them as SS seems to be so well loved on this sub and seems to work for a lot of people, I just sadly am not one of those people it seems. Everything ran super sweet and cloying on me, even the scents that people swear up and down are photorealistic atmospherics. For posterity I sampled:

**During the Rain:** *Storm Accord/Layering Note: Petrichor, soaked Earth, limestone, loam, clay and wet concrete:* The one I was most excited about and looking at as a similar experience to Alkemia‚Äôs St. Louis Cemetery. This is the scent I had the best experience with from SS and seemed to suffer much less from that strange sweet underlying odor that the others had. In general the performance was similarly poor to Alkemia‚Äôs St. Louis Cemetery and I did not enjoy this scent as much, although I did find them similar! This had a bit more dirt to it on me but very little concrete.

**Foxcroft:** *Decaying Leaves, Rich Black Soil, Dry Leaves, Fall Air, Woods, Chimney Smoke.* The one I was second most excited about! Besides the mystery cloying scent from the carrier, I found it too sweet in general which I was not expecting. I tried some of Hexennacht‚Äôs decaying leaf fragrances after this and I think it‚Äôs just the decaying leaf note in general that I‚Äôm disappointed with regardless of house! I live on an orchard and spend a lot of time in decaying leaves and this ain‚Äôt it lol.

**Monastic:** *Frankincense, fog, rose, myrrh, labdanum, spikenard, dust.* This was my best guess for an ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù of Alkemia‚Äôs Gothique but I found it to have some oddly ‚Äúsavory‚Äù notes going on in it, not sure how else to describe it lol. Gothique had a kind of crispness to it that this did not share. More similar to Hex‚Äôs Exorcist.

**Russian Caravan:** *Amber, smoked black tea, leather, pine resin, Earth, smoke, black currant, black pepper.* Again, just very cloying on me, I think I was mostly getting the leather note with a little of the amber and resin.

**Sea of Gray**: *Vanilla rain, saltwater, seaweed, ambergris (vegan), white amber, roasted seashells, white sandalwood, frangipani*. I‚Äôm gonna defend this choice as one I knew I would be disappointed in because of the vanilla note lol, but Cliffside Bonfire (the scent I actually wanted to sample) was out of stock for sampling, and this had enough overlap of salty ocean notes that I thought it could give me an idea of how Cliffside Bonfire might perform on me, but the vanilla was so overpowering I couldn‚Äôt get anything else out of it. But you guys I‚Äôm ngl, out of the bottle and on my skin, it straight up smells like cat piss. I know it‚Äôs just my nose because this seems like a really popular one from SS and I truly do not want to put anyone off from trying this, but good god almighty my nose & skin chem hate this omg.

**Tether:** *Molten Metal, Sparks, Animalic Musk, Fur, Brown Leather.* The metal and spark notes were non-existent on me and I just got the gratingly sweet leather/carrier notes.

¬†

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

I had a great time trying out all of these fragrances, even the ones that weren‚Äôt winners on me. The only real disappointment was Solstice just because it was a non-starter with my skin chem, but I‚Äôll keep trying those samples every few months just to see if they change at all and maybe pleasantly surprise me eventually! Besides Alkemia, I was most excited to try Pineward as they seemed to be offering exactly the kind of vibe I was looking for and I‚Äôm so happy that all the scents were slam dunks for me :‚Äô) I‚Äôm also so happy I had so many hits with Alkemia as they were the other house I was most excited to try and vibed the most with. I‚Äôm super bummed SS and Hex didn‚Äôt work with my skin chem as they both have really unique and interesting sounding fragrances and I love their vibes! Probably best for my wallet though lmao. Turnaround time & customer service were all fast and great from each house I tried! The average was 1-3 days from ordering to shipping so they all arrived very quickly, and packaging was delightful from all. The longest TAT was for the samples I got from Ajavie, which they stated clearly on their site so no issue there. I‚Äôm sad all the petrichor scents were so fleeting, but maybe someone here with more perfume knowledge than me can confirm whether those are typically always short lived notes or maybe my skin just hates them across the board lol?

Anyway, thank you to all the lovely people on this sub and all your wonderful thoughts & reviews, and for inspiring me to dip my toes into the wonderful world of indies! :3 This stuff is way more my jam than anything I've found in the mainstream/designer world (the real reason why I've only had the same three bottles of perfume for the last 10+ years besides price lmao).

I wanted to taste the notes so I made a simple latte with about 2 teaspoons of sugar and a 1:1.5 ratio of espresso to oatmilk. I‚Äôve always made my plain lattes like this and have always enjoyed it, but with this pod it felt underwhelming. I couldn‚Äôt taste any prominent notes and if anything, it almost tasted watered down despite the fact that little to no ice had melted when I took the first sip and there wasn‚Äôt too much milk. I also clean my machine weekly so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the problem. 

Obviously I don‚Äôt want my money to go to waste, especially with this being one of the more expensive pods, so does anyone have any flavor pairings or tips? I currently have caramel and vanilla syrup, white chocolate sauce, and I just made a brown sugar vanilla syrup.

He didn‚Äôt visit. He just spent time there. Key difference. For reference this guys most memorable experience is the money he saved on his AMEX card.

I‚Äôm reminded of my friends brother who flew *alllllll* the way to Turkey to get a fucking hair transplant and then just flew right back. Didn‚Äôt even bother to explore Istanbul. One of the most exciting and vibrant cities on the planet.

He just went straight there to reverse the process of aging and dying for a few years and once he had accomplished that mission (not a goal, a mission, there‚Äôs an important difference there. Goals come from the brain, missions come from penis), he just came back.*

Anyone who believes otherwise is either useless, a moron, or a coward who‚Äôs too afraid of what other people will feel about the story he‚Äôs telling. 

Back to this man. This is a man whose home is full of fake plastic trees, which in my eyes are even more of an affront to God than sad beige children‚Äôs toys and iPad parenting. This man wants the semblance of life without having to confront its ugly realities. His fake plastic trees will never remind him *I have to water this thing so it won‚Äôt die*. Or *I have to remind myself to pull the shades open so it can be kissed by the sun, because it will wither in the shadows*. 

Fake plastic tree people are doing their best to pretend that the difference between light and shadow doesn‚Äôt exist. I wonder if they ever look at those fake plastic leaves and think about how they will be outlived by them.

Life has consequences. One of the consequences of bringing life into this world is that one day it will die. No checklist of missions will make you come to terms with that. Only digging through the mud and the roots will. The deeper you get into the mud, the deeper the roots become, and the more you become tangled with them.

The irony is that grabbing onto those roots and learning from them  is what sets us free.

I like dirty people. I like the people in the mud and the roots. Real people. You can‚Äôt have leafy greens without mud and roots‚Ä¶. and that‚Äôs what coffeeshop ‚Äúdigital nomads‚Äù and fake plastic tree people don‚Äôt get.

And to those people: Are you even alive? Is everything just a statistic to you? Have you ever experienced a moment? Or taken a breath? 

You may end up having more years on this planet than me, but how were they spent? Did you ever get dirty? Did you ever understand how good it felt to be clean after a romp in the filth? Did you ever dig?

And when you were done digging, did you remember to look up?

Now someone is coming in and out of our rental house while we sleep, tormenting us.","Looking back, I should have trusted my instinct when I first saw it‚Äî*the symbols*. I should have followed the house rules. Now it‚Äôs too late, and they‚Äôre coming for us.



**Arrival: Three Days Ago**



My wife and I reached our vacation rental in Flagstaff, AZ. When we saw the listing, we knew it was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù for our long weekend getaway. A small guest house with a private entrance, green space, a deck, and a small backyard tucked against the pines. The house is removed from downtown, yet only a short 15-minute drive to bars and restaurants. Perfect.



We checked ourselves in using the keypad. My wife waited in the car while I swept the house, a precaution we always take‚Äîyou can never be too safe.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù



I unlocked the front door and stepped inside. At first glance, the home looked recently updated and even nicer than the listing photos.¬†



‚ÄúDarcy is going to love this place,‚Äù I said out loud.



The floors appeared to be the original hardwood planks. Large picture windows with views of the surrounding forest and mountains lined the walls. A fireplace anchored the main living area, hugged by a cozy sofa and love seat.¬†



I proceeded to the kitchen. On the counter next to the farmhouse sink, a note:



*Welcome to PineHouse!*¬†



*To make your stay as enjoyable as possible, please do not deviate from our house rules:*¬†

* *The house is old. Pipes will make noise. Don‚Äôt be alarmed*
* *Don‚Äôt enter the woods after 11 pm*
* ¬ß‚àÜ



I paused for a moment and tried to make sense of the demands. I reread the note over and over, but couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was wrong. What do the symbols mean? And why would someone go into the woods at night?¬†



‚ÄúNo reason to alarm Darcy.‚Äù



I hid the note in a drawer and continued my sweep of the house.¬†



I opened the pantry and found the coffee maker and a few extra bowls and pans‚Äînothing unusual. On the way to the primary bedroom, there was a door with a keypad lock and a small framed note reading, ‚ÄúFor Host Use Only.‚Äù Typical of rental properties.



The primary bedroom had high ceilings and a king-sized bed covered in pillows. It smelled fresh, like lavender. I opened the closet, found a few hangers, then looked through the en suite bath‚Äîall clear.¬†



Only the guest bedroom remained.¬†



As I stepped into the spare room, I was suddenly met with a brief, foul stench of wet earth and decay. Before I could pinpoint the source of the repulsive smell, my attention quickly snapped to the back of the room.¬†



The back door was left wide open.



My heart skipped a beat. I moved quickly toward the door to peer outside, looking for any signs of disturbance.



In the distance, another house nestled deeply into the woods was visible.¬† It had a single window illuminated near the pitch of the roof, giving away position. It was an old A-Frame painted deep black, camouflaging it amongst the trees in the darkening sky.



The slate colored dwelling almost looked like it was alive, feeding on the forest.¬†



Stalking *this* house with its single lit-up eye.¬†



*Watching me.*



I felt drawn in, almost under a spell. I couldn‚Äôt look away as though the structure put me into a trance state.



‚Äú*HEY!!!*‚Äù my wife bellowed sharply as she lurched at me.



‚ÄúJesus, you scared the living hell out of me!‚Äù She always got a kick out of startling me. It worked a little too often.



‚ÄúWatcha staring at!?‚Äù



At least my wife hadn‚Äôt seen the door unlocked, wide open for anyone curious enough to sneak in. She was also spared the image of the black dwelling in the woods and its lone gaze devouring the forest seared into her mind.¬†



‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù



She would have demanded that we cancel and find another place. I pulled myself away, shut the door, and twisted the deadbolt.¬†



‚Ä¢‚Ä¢



**Night One**



Without warning, I woke up abruptly. Three sounds reverberated from somewhere *inside* the house.¬†



The first sound was sharp, the second dull and drawn out, the last *booming***.**



Knock. *Draaaagg‚Ä¶* ***BAAANGGG!!***



I looked anxiously at the clock: 2:17 am.¬†



I grabbed my phone and pocket knife from the nightstand, quietly slipped out of bed, and began to search the house. As I moved between rooms, the floorboards moaned, aching from old age.¬†



The air was still, and I could hear myself breathing heavily. My heart was pounding as I found my way through the dark, unfamiliar home.



I made it to the guest room and checked the back door. It wasn‚Äôt open, but it also wasn‚Äôt locked.¬†



Shit.¬†



I opened the door to survey the backyard. The forest was pitch black now. Even the house deep in the woods was blanketed in darkness, the window no longer lit.



I let out a deep sigh of relief, stepped back inside, and locked the door tightly.



*Breathe.*



***‚ÄúThe house is old. Pipes will make noise. Don‚Äôt be alarmed.‚Äù***

**Night Two**



It was a little after 11:30 pm. We had just finished watching a movie and were ready to call it a night. This time, I double-checked both external doors. After the first day, I wasn‚Äôt taking any chances.¬†



First, the front door: locked tight.



I started walking toward the guest room. Through the window off the kitchen, I could hear the wind howling. The trees were violently swaying in the darkness. The window was open, and the earthy smell of evergreen invaded the room.



I made my way to the back door. It was gaping open again.



Shit. Shit.



In the distance, in front of the decaying house in the woods, a bonfire had been ignited. Its flames shot up through the canopy of the trees, threatening the night. The flickering orange light danced amongst the canopy of the forest. The thick, heavy smell of smoke circulated in the midnight air.



Against better judgment, I exited the house, closing the distance between me and the edge of the woods. I made my way onto a small path that cut through the forest toward the A-frame, advancing quietly toward the fire.¬†



A dozen yards in, I saw something tucked between the trees. A silhouette of a person standing 30 yards away. They weren‚Äôt moving. They just stood there.¬†



I couldn‚Äôt see their face, but I could feel them gazing directly at me. Like they‚Äôd been watching me the entire time. A wave of anxiety and panic washed over my mind. My heart beat against my chest.¬†



RUN BACK TO THE HOUSE.

  


**‚Äú*****Don‚Äôt enter the woods after 11 pm.‚Äù***

**Night Three**



I was jolted awake: 2:17 am again, exactly. I heard noise from inside the house again, only this time it was long, jagged like teeth, and clawing against walls.



Scraatcch. Scraaaaatch.



Darcy woke up. She looked panicked, pale, as if she‚Äôd seen a ghost.



‚ÄúDid you hear tha‚Ä¶?‚Äù



*Scraaaaaatttccccch.*



The hair on my neck stood straight up, nerves on fire.¬†

  


***‚ÄúThe house is old. Pipes will make noise, don‚Äôt be alarmed.‚Äù***

  


I jumped out of bed, slowly moved into the living room, and passed the kitchen. As I turned the corner, I saw it. The back door was wide open.¬†



‚ÄúNo. Not again.‚Äù



I looked at the adjacent wall of the guest room. This time, the closet door was also gaping open. The dresser inside moved to the right, exposing a hole that led to a hidden room.¬†



A crawl space that shouldn‚Äôt be there. It didn‚Äôt fit the layout of the house.



My nerves electrified like lightning and coursed through my body. My mind and body screamed to turn the other way. But after everything I‚Äôd seen and been through, I just had to know.



I crouched down and made my way inside the crawl space. I turned on the flashlight and began canvassing the hollow space. The air was still. There were no windows. The floors were unfinished and made of earth. The room smelled like decay, damp with a faint hint of copper.



In the center of the room was an object I couldn't quite make out. I moved nervously closer. My heart pounded, trying to escape my chest. The walls felt like they were closing in on me.



A black box.



It looked heavy, about 12 inches square. There was a thick liquid seeping from the bottom across the dirt floor. I froze as I further inspected the box. On the upper right corner, two symbols were imprinted in wet ebony paint:

  


**¬ß‚àÜ**

  


Suddenly, I heard Darcy dart into the guest room behind me. She sounded panicked.



‚Äú*Where are you!*?‚Äù she cried.



‚ÄúWhatever you do, **do** ***NOT*** **come in here**!‚Äù



‚Ä¢‚Ä¢



**Right Now**



I dragged myself out of the crawl space, trying to process what I‚Äôd just seen. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe.¬†



‚ÄúWe have to leave*,*‚Äù I said desperately. ‚ÄúDarcy, get your things and get in the car.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on!? *WHAT WAS THAT*!?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain on our way home. Right now, I just need you to trust me. We need to leave‚Ä¶ ***NOW***‚Äù



We left the room, the back door still open. Darcy started chaotically stuffing our clothes and belongings into our bags while I started the car. I ran back into the house, grabbed everything, and tossed it into the backseat.



Finally, I began driving down the long, narrow dirt road away from the house. Darcy was in shock, crying. I felt overwhelmed with panic.¬†



As we continued to descend the driveway, I took one last glance in the rearview mirror at the guest house.



The front door was now wide open.¬†



I see someone exiting the house‚Ä¶ *running after the car,* ***shrieking*****.**¬†



They quickly reach the end of the driveway and abruptly stop. Standing there, staring as we continued to drive away, the house vanishing from view.



‚Ä¢‚Ä¢



An hour later, on the way home, Darcy was still understandably distraught. She had her phone out when she interrupted the silence in the car as she read from her news feed.



‚ÄúPolice have responded to a call from neighbors who heard screaming in the night. They found a body deep in the woods near an abandoned A-frame. The body was severely burned from a bonfire the night before. A few trees had a mysterious symbol carved into them. This has all the signatures of continued occult activity in the area.‚Äù



She paused for a moment before looking me in the eyes.



‚ÄúThe body is missing its head.‚Äù¬†

Everything had been great the year we had been together. The last time we saw each other was the Sunday before Thanksgiving and they told me they had a great time before they went home. They went on a trip with their coworker during the week of Thanksgiving and we made plans to see each other the following Monday. Everything was fine but when they got back the day before, they rescheduled til next Saturday. I was fine with that but as the week went on they progressively started acting weird and cold. 

That Thursday night he texted me he was going out with friends and didn‚Äôt text me back at all past 7pm which was definitely weird and at that point I knew something was up. The next morning I saw that his friend posted a story and it was clear that my ex was hosting a party at this bar for a big event going on with him that I won‚Äôt get into. So I text him and to make a long story slightly shorter he tells me he‚Äôs unhappy with decisions I was making because I wasn‚Äôt seeing friends enough since I was so overwhelmed with college as I was in my final semester, as well as just really stressed about money. 

He came over that night to talk and I was emotional because I felt very blindsided since he didn‚Äôt communicate these issues he was having and he had always told me he‚Äôd be direct if anything was making him unhappy. While I believed his reason, I definitely felt that he was hiding something that he didn‚Äôt want to discuss for whatever reason. The conversation ultimately was reassuring though because he told me he wanted to be with me and that he still wanted to be in my life. He said he wanted to get back together after I worked on things more. A major thing he would say during the conversation was that I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and that everybody loves me and that I have a good heart. He basically said that things are a bit different now since we‚Äôre not together, but he still wanted to be close. It was definitely a more complex conversation but I‚Äôm trying to be somewhat brief. 

We had plans to spend Christmas with his friends and I knew a lot of my friends were going out of town, so I asked if he still wanted to do that if we‚Äôre still close and his friends still liked me. He said he had no problem with that but had to double check with his friends. We spent the rest of the night just hanging out and there were times I would tear up and he would say ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt be so upset, I‚Äôm still in your life, we‚Äôre still close‚Äù. He was very reassuring of where we stood, which did help. 

He was hosting a party at this bar the following Friday for a big event in his life and I kept checking with him that he wanted me there/was okay with it as I didn‚Äôt want to make him uncomfortable since things were fresh. Again, he was super reassuring throughout the week about it. That Friday, I show up to the party and he says hi and we both kinda do our own things and I spent time chatting with his friends. 

Everybody was very nice except his roommate, who I knew very well. When I said hi to her she just glared at me like she wasn‚Äôt happy I was there. I tried to not overthink, but the whole night I would see her from across the room glaring at me. At some point I‚Äôm waiting for the restroom and my ex comes out and makes a comment under his breath and walks past me without looking at me. At that point it was feeling as though neither of them wanted me there and I was confused because again, he was extremely reassuring of our friendship and that he wanted me to come. I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene but I was progressively getting more uncomfortable so I texted him asking if he wanted me there. He said omg yes of course sorry I‚Äôm just running around talking to everybody. He avoided being anywhere near me until towards the end of the party, I‚Äôm talking to two of his friends and he comes up to us, but turns his body away from me and only talks to them as if I‚Äôm not there. 

As the party is ending, everybody is leaving to go to another bar and his friends tell me I should come. I wait til more people leave so I don‚Äôt make a scene and go up to him and ask if he was comfortable with me coming. He says he‚Äôs fine with it but he worried about me spending money and there‚Äôs a $30 cover etc etc. I could tell he wasn‚Äôt being honest and it took him like 10 minutes to finally say yeah maybe don‚Äôt come. The whole time we were talking he looked at me in this way he never had before, just so incredibly cold. Again, the conversation we had the previous week was very reassuring and he was so adamant about us being good. I go home feeling so confused and sad. I just couldn‚Äôt understand what was happening and why he switched up so quickly and why his roommate was so rude. I fall asleep crying which I honestly don‚Äôt think has ever happened before. 

The next day I apologized for disrupting the night and he also apologized saying he was just overwhelmed with all the people there and he drank too much. I asked him about Christmas again to make sure that that was still okay. He said he had no problem with it he just still had to ask his friend who I knew fairly well. We agreed to see each other the following Saturday and just hang out instead of having more serious interactions like the last few weeks. The week leading up to that I brought up Christmas a few times just to make sure he felt okay about that which he kept saying was no problem. I told him if the answers no that‚Äôs okay, just lmk sooner rather than later because I didn‚Äôt want to find out right before that I‚Äôd be alone in Christmas. 

I also was talking to him a bit about how I was feeling and that I just felt really confused since things had changed so quickly etc etc. He said he was good with hearing about how I felt and wanted to help me. At some point during the week though I brought things up a bit too much and he told me it was starting to wear on him since he had a lot going on. Which was totally understandable so I apologized and the week went on. 

That Saturday we were supposed to get coffee in my neighborhood around maybe 1pm. He texted me he‚Äôd be late because he woke up late and needed to eat etc which was fine, he was never very punctual. Though he did say he was meeting friends later around 6 so it was a bit frustrating since we hadn‚Äôt seen each other and this was supposed to be an opportunity for us to kinda reset things and just hang out as friends. We meet up around 3 and he‚Äôs pretty stand offish and comes across like he doesn‚Äôt want to be there. We get coffee and stay at the cafe a bit just chatting, he‚Äôs on his phone a lot and just acting weird. At the time I think I was still just so confused and sad about everything I was super passive out of fear of making him mad. 

We start walking around outside but it was a really cold day in NYC so we decide to go to my apartment and watch something together and just talk. We were there for maybe an hour and a half and he was on his phone most of the time and again just was very stand offish and cold. On the way up to my apartment I bring up Christmas again because at this point it‚Äôs in maybe four or five days. And he goes ‚Äúoh idk I mean the party was kinda weird‚Äù. Which came across as though he was blaming me even though he had apologized too and said he understood how I felt etc. 

At some point he got up three times in 15 minutes to use the restroom but each time he would bring his phone and he‚Äôd only be in there for a minute or two. The bathroom is right next to to where we were sitting so I could tell he was just going on his phone even more. I started to feel that he was maybe texting a hookup or something but I was just so afraid of making things worse between us I didn‚Äôt say anything. In hindsight it was so insulting because he really was not making an effort to be subtle. I talked to him a bit about our breakup and how I felt like he wasn‚Äôt being totally honest. He insisted he was being truthful and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt get any other answer so I sorta just gave up. Again, he was very reassuring even though he was acting weird. 

We talk about Christmas a bit and he said he‚Äôll ask his friend about it tonight since he‚Äôs seeing him. Maybe 30 more minutes go by and he says he really has to go meet his friends uptown and that he‚Äôs already kinda late. I was bummed because the whole thing was so weird and just confusing but I say okay goodbye etc. The whole time I was pretty nice despite everything and he just was so different from the entire time we were together. 

About 45 minutes go by and my friend in California and I were gonna FaceTime. She said she was on her way home so I go on find my iPhone to see what her eta was. When I open my phone, I see that my ex is‚Ä¶.across the street? Like a five minute walk from me. So at this point I‚Äôm like okay yeah he was going to a hookup. I was really hurt because it felt so intentional, like to make plans for it while we‚Äôre together and to go to a hookup across the street from me. It‚Äôs like he wanted to hurt me. 

I text him like did you really go to a hookup? And the message doesn‚Äôt deliver, but since I can see his location he must‚Äôve turned his phone off. 30 minutes go by and he texts back and is like omg noooo. And then he says he was picking up the roommate of the friend whose apartment he was going to uptown. Obviously that was a lie given how long he had been there, he made no mention of going there before he left, and he doesn‚Äôt even like that roommate that much. At this point I honestly just didn‚Äôt want to make things worse because I didn‚Äôt want to be alone on Christmas because I was still just very sad over the breakup and the last few weeks. So I pretend that I believe him. 

I think the hookup situation just snapped me out of the denial I was in. I looked back on a lot of stuff, including when we were together, and I realized that he wasn‚Äôt the person I thought he was. I realized that the Christmas thing was a lie and that he‚Äôs just been dragging it out, I think in part because he didn‚Äôt want to look bad. But again, I asked him so many times and he reassured me. And I specifically asked that he not tell me at the last minute. 

When he gets to his friend‚Äôs I text him to let me know what his other friend says about Christmas. At this point I‚Äôm honestly just really freaking out because I felt that the last year was just a total lie. There were a ton of things that I used to tell myself ‚Äúhe wouldn‚Äôt do that to me‚Äù even when things obviously weren‚Äôt right. 

I started to panic because everything had been so good before, he had been so sweet and we got along so easily. I think I was holding out hope for Christmas also in part because if he ended up saying yes, then maybe he didn‚Äôt lie about everything at least. I told him ‚Äúplease let me know when you can. Sorry to bug you I‚Äôm just kinda stressing over it‚Äù that‚Äôs all I said and‚Ä¶.he just completely goes off. Paragraph after paragraph after paragraph saying how he told me earlier in the week to not put anything on him and that Im stressing him out and how he‚Äôs been nothing but good to me. He said that what I was doing was really shitty. 

I was so‚Ä¶just stupid in that moment. I apologize, I tell him I understand where he‚Äôs coming from and that I didn‚Äôt mean to upset him. I was trying to pacify him but he just wouldn‚Äôt stop. I think he had started drinking already. He has never, ever talked to me like that before. And ultimately it ended with him saying he needed more space and that we shouldn‚Äôt talk for awhile. Again, I was so stupid and was flooded with guilt. I freaked out, damn near had a panic attack because I felt I ruined something that meant so much to me. In that moment I forgot about all of the shitty things he did. And once again, I fell asleep sobbing. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw on our texts that he stopped bothering me of us from sharing our locations. Which to me more read that he was drunk and mad that I brought up the hookup, but who knows. 

The next few days I felt awful, I had been having a lot of stomach issues the past few weeks which had subsided by this weekend. I originally thought it was happening for other reasons, but after that Saturday, the issues came back way worse and I realized it was totally psychosomatic. I talked to friends about some things but honestly it wasn‚Äôt until January I really started to give details. I had spoken so highly of him and I felt embarrassed with how things blew up. And for some reason I felt so guilty. I wasn‚Äôt angry at him at the time, I was just so sad and so confused still. 

Fortunately, my bosses at the last minute got me a ticket to go to California for Christmas as a Christmas gift. Which honestly, thank god. It was so cold at the time and my ex made me feel so alone and isolated and that I didn‚Äôt have friends/enough friends in his eyes (mind you most of his friends he spent our whole relationship constantly complaining about and judging). 

We didn‚Äôt talk at all on Christmas. New Year‚Äôs Day I text him for some reason and apologize for how things got and he said thank you for the apology and of course did not apologize. We agree to try to talk in spring and have space until then. 

Going to California definitely helped. It reminded me that I‚Äôm not alone and that I do have people who love me. I came back to New York feeling pretty good. A few weeks into the new year, I started thinking about what he said that night. How he had ‚Äúbeen nothing but good to me‚Äù  finally I started to have more self respect and I got so angry. Nothing but good to me? Things wouldn‚Äôt have even gotten to that point if he had been honest. If he didn‚Äôt do all this stuff. And honestly I‚Äôm leaving out a bunch of other things since I know this is so long already. 

Towards the end of January I type up a long text which was honestly way too kind to him. It was basically saying that what he said that night was ridiculous and that he had hurt me a lot that month and he didn‚Äôt apologize for anything except I guess the party, but he basically turned around and ended up blaming me for it the following week. It was a firm, but respectful text. I ended it saying that I don‚Äôt mean to upset him with the text, but I didn‚Äôt want to talk in spring and I end up being the only one that did any self reflection. 

He of course never responded, muted me on instagram and blocked me from his story. Definitely looked like he didn‚Äôt agree and was angry. Between February and now we ended up having conversations here and there. We had one decent one where we talked about talking again, maybe a bit later than originally planned. He said he did want to talk about everything so we could understand each other‚Äôs perspectives. 

That helped me for a bit but as I talked to friends more and thought about everything I just felt like he was stringing me along. Or if he did want to talk, he wouldn‚Äôt take responsibility. Which at that point, I‚Äôd feel like it was a waste of time having any hope for reconciliation. So I texted him another long thing saying I wish he would acknowledge the things he did or something before we talked in person. He got annoyed and said he wanted space. He said he did want to talk but in person not over text. Which is my preference too, but waiting months just to hear I‚Äôm sorry or a things could‚Äôve been handled differently was a lot for me. 

But for some reason I said fine let‚Äôs have space. A month ago I had texted him after awhile of not talking just to check on him to see how he was doing. It was actually a really nice brief conversation. He was a lot nicer than the whole year and it felt like things were different, like we had both grown a bit separately. We agreed to talk again at the end of may and possibly talk in person. 

Since then I‚Äôve felt so much better just in general, not just about us. I started to have a new perspective on everything that happened. I felt that although everything was very hard and painful, maybe it was necessary to facilitate growth for me as an individual. I‚Äôve felt so much happier than I ever have honestly. This whole year was very up and down but I‚Äôve come out of it in a much better place. I feel more mature, more focused, more ready for my future. I feel more motivated just in general. 

I felt that if we both had grown this year, then maybe we could have a good conversation when we did talk. I thought we could just be open and honest about everything and move on as better or stronger people. I‚Äôve honestly been so happy about how I‚Äôve been feeling I was just excited to tell him about it. And previous conversation felt really good so I thought it would be no problem. 

So I text him on Sunday saying hey I‚Äôve been thinking about some stuff and was wondering if I could run it by you. I think you‚Äôll be happy to hear it. But if not that‚Äôs totally fine it can wait (not verbatim but you get it) today‚Äôs been six days since then and he didn‚Äôt reply. I texted him today to see how he was feeling and to say I hope my message didn‚Äôt upset you etc etc. 

Turns out he blocked me after I sent that message. I sent him a message on instagram saying hey I hope my message didn‚Äôt upset you. I was just excited to tell you etc. I‚Äôm sorry that it had a negative effect. Our last conversation was good so I didn‚Äôt think it would hurt you. 

He replies and is basically like oh I told you I need space you‚Äôre upsetting me by crossing this boundary etc etc. I apologized and explained that I misunderstood the boundary and thought he‚Äôd be okay with me texting him that. He never really communicated that he didn‚Äôt want me texting him at all until the end of may. He had no issue with me texting him a few weeks ago and was extremely nice so I just misread things. 

He‚Äôs yet to reply and honestly I doubt he will. I really am in a much better place so I‚Äôm not very sad or angry. If anything I feel like his lack of accountability even now and him still being callous just tells me that maybe he hasn‚Äôt grown much in the past six months. 

I feel like he just spends his time criticizing everybody else which just leads to him stunting his own growth. The whole time we were together he would go on and on about all his friends and all of these small harmless things about them that he judged them for. Which honestly, was usually not that big of a deal. But I‚Äôm starting to realize that he just really has no interest in growing as a person. Since it‚Äôs always somebody else‚Äôs fault, why would he need to improve? I feel like that‚Äôs his mindset. 

That‚Äôs the only thing that makes me sad, but not in a way that‚Äôll disrupt my life. He was a very sweet person before. I think he does have a lot of potential and that he‚Äôs not a bad person. But I think he‚Äôs too fixated on everybody else‚Äôs flaws to recognize or work on his own. I think I‚Äôm the opposite where I‚Äôm overly critical of myself at times. But the benefit of that is that I always end up coming out of rough times a bit smarter or more mature, though I certainly can and should grow more. 

At this point I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the problem, or at least not the core of it. I‚Äôm not perfect, but I‚Äôm willing to put my ego aside to try to be a better person for those around me and myself. Maybe I could‚Äôve done better, but his lack of communication and honesty was what got us here. But maybe that‚Äôs what he wanted. 

I think if I did these things to him he would‚Äôve been so much angrier than I ever got. He had to stop talking to his best friend last year because she did something really messed up and never apologized for it. Even by the time we broke up he was still made at her for not taking accountability. And now I can‚Äôt help but think how similar they are in that sense. 

I wonder and I hope that eventually he can recognize that it‚Äôs okay to not always be right. It makes me sad because I think he could be so much happier if he let go of his ego. He spends a lot of time with his friends and he would always tell me that you need a good support system, which I agree, but he was so unhappy last year even with that support system. This whole year it‚Äôs like he spends his weekends only ever going out and drinking. Which certainly isn‚Äôt a bad thing, but I feel like he‚Äôs just running away from himself. Just being around people isn‚Äôt enough. Just drinking isn‚Äôt enough, you need to make a conscious effort to grow and to be happy. 

Sorry this is so incredibly long. I‚Äôve never written one of these before. Obviously my story is gonna be biased but now that I feel more clear headed I just wanted to see what other people thought. I for sure left out so much since the length is already crazy. 

I could talk about so much more that happened. The stuff he lied about while we were together, like him lying about having sex with one of his close friends before we met, who I think he may have been hooking up with behind my back, is a big one. Him going to the clinic for four hours for a ‚Äúheadache‚Äù on my birthday is another. But honestly I think yall get the idea if you‚Äôve read the whole thing. 

I appreciate anybody‚Äôs perspective, please be as honest as you want. Any opportunity for growth is an opportunity I‚Äôm welcome to. ",1,1745108214.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

In no way shape or form is it a 5-star resort as they claim. 2 or 3-star at best. During the last 2 days of our stay the water in our room was not functional. Like we couldnt even flush the toilets or take showers. We heard from talking to people around the resort that it was a common problem others were also experiencing in rooms on the top floors of the buildings. Management did nothing. No refund or price adjustment, nothing. Others we talked to who did have water, found their hot water would constantly turn cold. 

The beach was dirty, garbage everywhere. One guy out in the morning bagging sargassum for a couple hours, rarely making a dent. Then would leave 20 bags of it sitting all day on the beach. In comparison, we stayed at an AI in Mexico and they had crews out there every morning and had the entire beach clean and raked in under 2 hours. Saw one waitress come by all day on the beach. The pool was not much better. There was a teeth flosser that was laying on the same set of stairs the entire 7 days we were  there. A table of empty bottles and cups in the same spot on the beach for 2 days. That sort of thing. 

Lack of healthy food choices and they constantly ran out of items. They had scrambled eggs one day and never had them again during our stay. The same 3 melons were the only fruit options every day.  One day the only food you could get between the hours of 3-5pm were chicken nuggets and French fries. You had to put your name in at the hostess stand and wait to be seated for the buffet. We waited upwards of 20 mins to be seated for breakfast. Never experienced this at any AI's we've been to. Food presentation is non existent compared to other true 5-star resorts we've been to. 

Two out of the three buildings have a coffee shop, but the one in our building was sporadically staffed. Building C is the only one with restaurants. If you have mobility issues and are in Bldg A, it's a 10-15 minute walk to even get coffee or water in the morning. Forget going anywhere or getting anywhere if its raining and you're in the far building. The elevators are rickety in our building and stopped working twice while we were there. 

The kids water play area looked like it hadn't been functional in years. 

They are grossly understaffed. Restaurants not open every day. 

The rooms are nice and spacious. Housekeeping staff did a great job. The grounds are nice. That's about all the positives we could find.

That was how Daunir would describe this lovely Friday afternoon.

The morning sun filtered through the gauzy curtains of their apartment, painting the hardwood floors with soft gold. The scent of cinnamon and chicory coffee wafted from the kitchen, mingling with the quiet rustle of a page turning.¬†

Daunir sat curled in the corner of the couch, tail draped lazily over the armrest, a paperback resting awkwardly in his claws. It was a well-worn mystery novel, the kind Hazel insisted he try ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs light, and you need a break from all the sci-fi.‚Äù He was midway through the second chapter, suspicious of the waiter who served the champagne.¬†

Hazel stood by the stove, phone pressed between shoulder and cheek, one hand absentmindedly stirring a pot of batter for her toffee. Her voice was a little more animated than usual, laced with surprise and something brighter‚Äînostalgia.¬†

‚ÄúMarlene! Oh my God, I haven‚Äôt heard from you in forever!‚Äù¬†

On the couch, Daunir's eyes shifted toward her voice but kept reading.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I‚Äôm still in Savannah. No, I‚Äôm working at Hotel Tybee. I‚Äôve got the week off for Easter‚Ä¶ You have a girlfriend? Since when? Well, congratulations! Yep. Married, actually.‚Äù¬†

Daunir‚Äôs eye twitched upward, amused. Hazel had always been casual about their marriage in conversation. Most people didn‚Äôt expect her to be married to an Arxur, though, so his species rarely came up.¬†

‚ÄúNo, you haven‚Äôt met him. We got married after the Fed War was over, and things got a little‚Ä¶ hectic.‚Äù

Pause.¬†

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt take his name, actually. He took mine.‚Äù Hazel laughed. ‚ÄúYeah, cultural thing. Honestly, I think he just liked the sound of it.‚Äù¬†

Daunir smirked without looking up. ‚ÄúI truly do,‚Äù he said under his breath.¬†

‚ÄúAnyway‚Äîwait, really? You‚Äôre coming to Savannah for Easter?‚Äù Her voice lifted, surprised again. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs amazing. We should absolutely meet up. You want to do a double date? Saturday night?‚Äù¬†

Another pause.

¬†Hazel raised an eyebrow and glanced toward Daunir.¬†

""That's a great idea! We love Low Tide Table!""¬†

A longer pause. Daunir could hear the tone shift‚Äîslightly cautious, slightly confused.



‚ÄúA non-human refugee?‚Äù Hazel asked. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ unexpected...‚Äù She turned away from the stove, toffee temporarily forgotten. ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt mind. Not at all. I‚Äîwait, which species is‚Äî‚Äù

Click.¬†

Hazel blinked and pulled the phone away from her ear, staring at it like it had personally betrayed her. Then she sighed, shaking her head as she dropped it onto the counter.¬†

Daunir closed his book, tilting his head. ‚ÄúThat sounded abrupt.‚Äù¬†

Hazel rubbed her face with both hands. ‚ÄúShe hung up before I could ask anything.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAbout her partner?‚Äù¬†

Hazel nodded, lips pursed. ‚ÄúAll I know is that she‚Äôs non-human and a refugee. That narrows it a little, but not nearly enough.‚Äù¬†

Daunir hesitated, claws tapping lightly against the back of the book. ‚ÄúShall I‚Ä¶ not attend?‚Äù¬†

Hazel‚Äôs head snapped up. ‚ÄúNo. You absolutely will. You‚Äôre my husband, and if Marlene has a problem with that, then that‚Äôs her problem.‚Äù

Daunir‚Äôs tail curled around his ankle, a clear sign of his unease. He stared at the coffee table like it might give him a tactical briefing.

¬†‚ÄúShe'll despise me,‚Äù he muttered, claws drumming rapidly against the cover of his book. ‚ÄúNot Marlene‚Äîher girlfriend. If she's not human, then I‚Äî I look like everything they were taught to fear.‚Äù¬†

He groaned and buried his head in his claws. ‚ÄúHazel. What if I speak in a way that troubles her? Or look at her like I am thinking of devouring her? What if she flees? Or screams?‚Äù¬†

Hazel crossed the room and sat beside him, resting her hand gently on his back. ‚ÄúOkay. Let‚Äôs take a breath.‚Äù

¬†He tried. He really did. But his shoulders stayed rigid. ‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go through the list.‚Äù

¬†Ah. The List. The list of things for Daunir to do so as not to frighten people. He didn‚Äôt respond, but he didn‚Äôt protest, either.¬†¬†

‚ÄúNumber one: Do not bare your teeth when you laugh.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do not!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou do, but it‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôll practice something‚Ä¶ softer. Less ‚Äòvelociraptor,‚Äô more ‚Äòawkward theater kid.‚Äô‚Äù¬†

He huffed through his nose.¬†

‚ÄúNumber two: Try to keep your tail from doing that slow coil thing. It reads like you‚Äôre about to strike.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a comfort motion, not a threat‚Äî‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI know. She might not.‚Äù He slouched, utterly defeated.¬†

‚ÄúYou know, maybe I just‚Ä¶ shouldn‚Äôt go.‚Äù Hazel gave him a look.¬†

‚ÄúAbsolutely not. You are going. I‚Äôm not letting you bail on this because your inner lizard wants to flee into a vent.‚Äù¬†

He blinked at her. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a very specific visual.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a very specific husband.‚Äù¬†

Silence settled between them again. He looked down at his hands, the claws folded together carefully, and whispered, ‚ÄúI just do not wish to ruin your meeting with your friend.‚Äù¬†

Hazel‚Äôs heart clenched. She reached out and cupped his snout, turning him gently to face her.¬†

‚ÄúListen to me, Daunir Lockhart. You are not going to ruin anything. You‚Äôre thoughtful, you‚Äôre trying, and you‚Äôre not the one who‚Äôs going to make this weird‚Äîthat‚Äôs my job.‚Äù¬†

A small huff escaped him. Almost a laugh.¬†

Then she leaned back, tapping her chin theatrically. ‚ÄúOkay. New plan.‚Äù¬†

His eyes narrowed suspiciously. ‚ÄúOh no.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe show up early. You go to the bathroom. I‚Äôll talk to Marlene and her girlfriend, break the news, get a read on how things are going‚Äîand when the moment‚Äôs right, I text you. You come out like a gentleman, and if all goes well, we have drinks and awkward stories and a relatively normal evening.‚Äù¬†

He stared at her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre suggesting I hide in the bathroom like a child waiting for a birthday surprise.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm suggesting we minimize trauma and keep things from turning into an interspecies cold war before appetizers.‚Äù¬†

Daunir still looked nervous. ‚ÄúIf the moment‚Äôs never right?‚Äù¬†

Hazel put a hand on his shoulder. ‚ÄúThen we leave and we‚Äôre back home watching that corny soap opera you like within an hour.‚Äù¬†

Daunir huffed. ‚ÄúRed Line Cafe is an episodic drama, not a soap opera.‚Äù¬†¬†

Hazel couldn‚Äôt help it. She laughed. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ Do we have a plan?‚Äù¬†

¬†He opened his mouth, then closed it. Thought.

¬†‚Äú‚Ä¶What kind of restaurant has the best bathrooms to hide away in?‚Äù¬†

Hazel grinned. ‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs the spirit.‚Äù

¬†\-¬†

The salt-heavy breeze rolled in from the river, carrying the scent of old wood, grilled shrimp, and fried hushpuppies. Boats bobbed lazily on the dock outside the open-air restaurant, their masts swaying gently against the backdrop of a late afternoon sun.¬†

Hazel stepped through the familiar entryway of Low Tide Table, the old sea-weathered boards creaking under her shoes. The hostess gave her a friendly smile and waved them through without needing a name‚ÄîHazel and Daunir were regulars here, after all.¬†

Daunir‚Äôs tail curled in close behind him as they stepped into the shaded dining area. He gave a quick glance around the room, scanning the tables, until Hazel discretely pointed at the table they‚Äôd be seated at. He nodded toward it with a tight-lipped expression.¬†

‚ÄúBathroom time,‚Äù he murmured.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing great,‚Äù Hazel said softly, squeezing his hand before letting him go.¬†

Daunir moved off with careful steps‚Äîhead down, shoulders pulled inward, trying not to draw attention. He slipped around a column and out of sight.¬†

Hazel turned toward the table just in time to see her.

Marlene was already seated, having been obscured by a booth in the sight-line of the entrance.¬†¬†

Her hair was longer than Hazel remembered, pulled up into a twist with her cats-eye readers perched on top of her head. She wore a sharp navy blazer over a white top and a burgundy skirt, and the minute she saw Hazel, her entire face lit up.

¬†‚ÄúHazel Lockhart, as I live and breathe!‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúMarlene Rhodes,‚Äù Hazel said, sitting across from her. ‚ÄúLook at you, still dressing like you‚Äôre about to close a real estate deal on a yacht.‚Äù¬†

Marlene laughed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because I am. Well, not the yacht part. Just real estate.‚Äù She pulled back, still beaming. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt aged a day.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI have absolutely aged,‚Äù Hazel replied, grinning, ‚Äúbut thank you for lying.‚Äù¬†

They sat, both still buzzing with that high you only get from reuniting with someone who once knew all your high school secrets.

¬†They ordered drinks‚ÄîHazel a sweet tea, Marlene a soda‚Äîand swapped stories.¬†

Hazel shared her UN work, her time in culinary school, carefully skipping the name of her spouse. Marlene caught her up on everything from her new apartment in Tallahassee to the ‚Äúweirdest closing ever‚Äù involving a ""haunted"" condo, a Thafki couple, and a raccoon infestation.

Then, after a lull in the laughter, Marlene tilted her head and asked the question. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ where‚Äôs your husband?‚Äù

¬†Hazel‚Äôs smile faltered. For a moment, she considered hedging. Deflecting. Waiting until Marlene‚Äôs girlfriend arrived. But no‚Äîif she couldn‚Äôt be honest here, it could only get worse.¬†

She took a breath. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ actually in the bathroom.‚Äù¬†

Marlene blinked, nodding, though there was a hint of apprehension in her eyes. ‚ÄúOh... alright.‚Äù¬†

Hazel pressed on. ‚ÄúBecause we wanted to have a minute before I dropped something big on you.‚Äù¬†

Marlene raised an eyebrow, intrigued. ‚ÄúAlright, shoot.‚Äù¬†

Hazel didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm married to an Arxur.‚Äù¬†

Silence.¬†

Marlene stared at her for a long beat. Her mouth opened slightly, then closed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚ÄîHazel. You‚Äôre married to an Arxur?‚Äù

Hazel nodded once, hands folded calmly in front of her. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Marlene leaned back in her seat, exhaling like she‚Äôd just taken a punch to the gut. ‚ÄúWow. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ okay, that‚Äôs not what I was expecting. At all.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. But he‚Äôs good. He‚Äôs gentle, and kind, and‚Äî‚Äù¬†

Marlene held up a hand. ‚ÄúHazel, stop. I‚Äôm not judging. I promise I‚Äôm not. But‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

She hesitated, looking down at the table. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs‚Ä¶ something I need to tell you about my girlfriend.‚Äù¬†

Hazel tilted her head. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù¬†

Marlene opened her mouth‚Äì

\-

The mirror was slightly fogged from the humidity, not from steam but from the heavy Georgia air sneaking in off the river.

Daunir adjusted his collar for what must have been the sixth time. It didn‚Äôt quite sit right on his shoulders‚Äîdesigned for humans, tailored for thick-scaled, broad-shouldered Arxur. But it would do.¬†

He smoothed it down and took a breath. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done this before,‚Äù he whispered to himself, eyes locked on his reflection. ‚ÄúThis is just a role, none the less different from any other. Just like Adolfo, just like Morgan, just like Pharaoh.‚Äù 

He straightened his posture. 

‚ÄúYou are calm. You are warm. You are charming.‚Äù A pause. ‚ÄúYou are Daunir Lockhart. Husband. Family man. Gentle giant.‚Äù¬†

Funny. That‚Äôs exactly what he wanted to be seen as all the time.¬†

He was about to turn on the sink to splash some cold water on his face, but then‚Äî A sound.¬†

Faint, from one of the stalls. A whimper. Choked. Wet. It was a sound Daunir hadn‚Äôt heard in years‚Äîbut he knew it well.¬†

An Arxur.¬†

Crying.¬†

He froze, instincts warring with empathy.¬†

Slowly, he turned away from the mirror and stepped back, gently pressing his claw against the nearest stall door.

¬†‚Äú‚Ä¶Hello?‚Äù he said softly, the voice he used with Hazel when she had a nightmare, not the one he used in casting calls.¬†

There was silence. Then‚Äî¬†



‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù came a voice. Arxur, unmistakably, but higher, and trembling. ‚ÄúJust‚Äîplease, I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt sound fine,‚Äù Daunir replied gently. ‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶ mind if I stay?‚Äù¬†

Another pause. Then the latch clicked and the door opened just a crack. A single amber eye peeked out. She was younger than him, maybe by a decade or two‚Äîslighter in build, and hunched inward like she wanted to collapse in on herself. Her scales were a mottled gray-green, and her posture was unmistakably one of someone trying not to be seen.¬†

‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre also an Arxur?‚Äù she asked, wary.

¬†‚ÄúArchives,‚Äù Daunir replied. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Daunir.‚Äù¬†

The door opened a little more, and she stepped out. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Miik,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here on a date.‚Äù¬†

Her claws twitched nervously. ‚ÄúWith my girlfriend. And‚Ä¶ with another couple. But I couldn‚Äôt‚Äîthere were so many people. And they all looked. And I just‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

She looked away. Her voice dropped. ‚ÄúI panicked. I hid.‚Äù¬†

Daunir nodded slowly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot. Especially on holidays.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt respond, but her tail coiled lightly around her feet.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to be out there too,‚Äù Daunir said after a moment. ‚ÄúMy wife is meeting an old friend. I‚Äôm in here psyching myself up like I‚Äôm about to go on stage while she warns her friend about me.‚Äù

That got a faint beep of laughter from Miik.

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel like I belong anywhere,‚Äù she said, voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúIn the Dominion, I wasn‚Äôt Arxur enough. I liked‚Ä¶ soft things. Color. Beauty.‚Äù Her shoulders tightened. ‚ÄúI was nothing but defective. And now here on Earth, everyone looks at me like I‚Äôm a threat. Like I‚Äôm too Arxur. Like no matter what I do, I‚Äôll never be enough of *anything* to be accepted.‚Äù

Daunir lowered his head in understanding.

‚ÄúPeople are going to judge you no matter what you do,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned. Whether you‚Äôre loud or quiet, kind or cold, someone‚Äôs always going to say you‚Äôre too much of one thing, or not enough of another. And there‚Äôs nothing you can do to change that.‚Äù

Miik looked up at him, eyes shining.

‚ÄúBut here‚Äôs the thing,‚Äù Daunir continued. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs nothing you can do to change them, why try? Their opinions are *their own.* They don‚Äôt belong to you. And they *don‚Äôt* get to decide who you are. So be who you are, without apologies, without fear.‚Äù

She sniffled, just barely.

He gave her a soft smile. ‚ÄúI should probably be taking my own advice. I‚Äôm hiding in a bathroom, after all.‚Äù

Her eyes widened. ‚Äú*You‚Äôre* hiding too?‚Äù

‚ÄúI had a whole entrance plan,‚Äù he said with mock solemnity. ‚ÄúHiding in the bathroom, followed by dramatic re-emergence on text cue. Very strategic.‚Äù

Miik chirped another laugh.

Just then, his phone buzzed. A message from Hazel:

**<3 Love of Mine <3: ‚ÄúShe knows. It‚Äôs safe. Come on out.‚Äù**

Daunir looked at Miik. ‚ÄúWould it help if‚Ä¶ we went out together?‚Äù

She hesitated. Looked at the mirror. Wiped under her eyes with the back of her wrist.

Then she nodded. ‚ÄúYes. It would.‚Äù

\-

The bathroom door creaked open, and the sunlight spilling in through the wide dockside windows felt far too bright. Daunir stepped out first, shoulders squared but tail taut with tension. Beside him, Miik walked carefully, eyes low, posture tight, her claws twitching at her sides.

Neither said a word.

They didn‚Äôt need to.

They were both terrified. Every inch of them said *flee*‚Äîbut neither did.

And as they walked across the floorboards of *Low Tide Table,* past the clatter of dishes and the hum of conversation, they each assumed the other would split off at the next turn, the next table, the next breath.

But the turns never came.

One table passed. Then another. Then another.

Still side by side. Still walking.

And then they both stopped.

Hazel and Marlene were seated at a table tucked near the window, looking directly at them. Neither woman moved. Neither woman blinked.

Both had enormous grins plastered on their faces the moment¬† they saw the two of them.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Oh,‚Äù Miik whispered.

‚ÄúOh you have got to be *kidding* me*,*‚Äù Daunir murmured.

Hazel stood first, beaming. ‚Äú*There* you are! You took longer than I thought.‚Äù

Marlene leaned her chin on her hand. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall two meet in the bathroom or in another lifetime?‚Äù

Daunir‚Äôs mouth opened. Then closed. Miik looked equally stunned.

Hazel rounded the table and took Daunir‚Äôs hand in hers, squeezing it reassuringly. ‚ÄúDaunir, this is Marlene, my best friend since ninth grade. Marlene, this is my husband, Daunir.‚Äù

Daunir gave a small nod, tail flicking behind him. ‚ÄúPleased to‚Äî‚Äù

Marlene held up her hand. ‚ÄúMiik, this is Hazel, my best friend since ninth grade. Hazel, this is my girlfriend, Miik.‚Äù

There was a beat of stunned silence.

Then all four of them burst into laughter.

It was ridiculous.

The two Arxur who had spent days agonizing over whether they would be judged, feared, or worse‚Ä¶ had been afraid of *each other.*

Hazel wiped a tear from her eye. ‚ÄúSo, just to recap: Marlene didn‚Äôt know *I* was married to an Arxur, and I didn‚Äôt know *Marlene* was *dating* an Arxur. And you two met in the bathroom like we're in a sitcom.‚Äù

Daunir growled into his claws. ‚ÄúOr like something out of *Red Line Cafe.*‚Äù

‚ÄúSeason eight, episode twenty-three,‚Äù Miik muttered. ‚ÄúWith the switched invitations.‚Äù

Daunir stared. ‚ÄúWait‚Äî*you* watch Red Line Cafe, too?‚Äù

Miik blinked. ‚ÄúReligiously.‚Äù

‚ÄúI *love* that show.‚Äù

Hazel gave Daunir a side-eye, smirking. ‚ÄúWell, I guess we don‚Äôt have to worry about breaking the ice anymore.‚Äù

It didn‚Äôt take long before the tension melted away completely. The four of them ordered drinks‚Äî iced tea for Miik, and plain water for Daunir‚Äî and later food‚Äî Crab legs for Daunir and Hazel, Caesar Salad for Marlene, and a rare steak for Miik‚Äî and before long, they were swapping stories, laughing over miscommunications, and delighting in the absurdity of it all.¬†

When the check came, Daunir lifted his glass, his tail flicking with theatrical flair.

‚ÄúAhem,‚Äù he said, voice rich and warm, ‚ÄúIf I may‚Ä¶ a final toast.‚Äù

The others quieted, their smiles already waiting.

‚ÄúTo love found, to fear lost, to this lovely dinner, hopefully the first of many, and above all‚Ä¶‚Äù

He lifted his glass a little higher.

‚ÄúTo new old friends!‚Äù",9,1745107266.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False

1k39tql,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1k39tql/the_power_of_consistency/,The power of consistency,"Consistency is key when it comes to sleep and building habits. By hitting the hay and waking up around the same time each day, you are training your body's internal clock, known as the circadian rhythm. This regularity leads to more efficient and restorative sleep, leaving you feeling refreshed and energized. If you consistently get around 8 hours of sleep, those days you get 6 or 4 won't feel so bad. Beyond sleep, establishing routines throughout your day provides a sense of structure and predictability, aswell as making you feel good about yourself for being even slightly productive. This can significantly reduce stress and anxiety, as you're less likely to feel overwhelmed by the unexpected. These positive habits can boost your focus, productivity, and overall well-being, allowokg you to navigate your day with room to focus on what matters.

I have alarms set for small things like; wake up (hopefully lol), make bed, stretch, make coffee, get ready for work. I find checking these things off keeps me on schedule and also gives me a small sense of accomplishment.

I've personally found using apps like notion and habitnow to be especially helpful. Actually, most of my phone has been designed around minimal distractions and pushing the things I know I should be doing at me. Maybe I'll write about phones next

Anyways, when he and his friend finish up and I‚Äôm closing out their tabs, he asks me ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre sitting down and getting food and drinks, that‚Äôs full service and you should leave 20 percent, but if you‚Äôre at a bar and only getting drinks you should leave a dollar per drink right?‚Äù I‚Äôve honestly never heard of that standard and it pretty much explains why some people leave 10% or less on tabs with only drinks. I told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna tell you how much you should tip or how I think you should tip, it‚Äôs entirely up to you. As a bartender, if I‚Äôm going out for drinks I always leave 22-25% unless I know the bartender personally and they hook me up, then I just give them whatever cash I have on hand.‚Äù I overheard him ranting to his friend after and saying stuff like not tipping if the bartender just opens a can of beer and gives it to you.

ETA: I didn‚Äôt realize this was such a common concept but tbf I‚Äôve only been bartending about 2 years. Even before I started bartending I‚Äôve always tipped by percent and not dollar amount, whether it was a bar or coffee shop. Also I changed the wording so it doesn‚Äôt come off as ragebaity

Edit 2: I feel like I should reiterate that I in no way told that guy how he should tip despite him asking my opinion and that percentage was in reference to ME going out for drinks not how I think people should tip or how I expect them to.

Debating on starting my own at a coffee shop or library, is this something that is desirable in Madison area or is there already a group like this not associated with UW University?

Just wanted to let you guys know that I have decided to put my money where my mouth is and put a ban on Starbucks until they change their uniform policies, pay you fair wages, drop the CEO's exorbitant salary, and permit you guys to unionize and negotiately with them fairly.

To Starbucks customers, please join me in the fight to flood their customer service with emails. I have included the link to their page to submit an email. I have also included the verbiage of my email if you would like to just copy and paste it. Feel free to modify it as you wish!

Good luck, my Starbies! We love you and appreciate you all for keeping us caffeinated and functional! We wouldn't be able to get through our work days without you!

Link:

https://customerservice.starbucks.com/sbux?id=contact

Verbiage:

As a long-time Starbucks customer, I have some serious concerns with your CEO's new uniform policy and would like my concerns forwarded to him. 

I can assure you with 100% certainty that we do not care how your employees are dressed, what piercings or tattoos they have, what color hair, shirts, pants, or shoes they wear, so long as it is appropriate attire for a coffee shop and they are clean and presentable. The fact that you make your employees purchase their uniforms is ridiculous. You should be providing the hat, shirt, and apron for free if you are requiring them to wear it. It is reprehensible that you are trying to capitalize on your employees by forcing them to purchase shirts beyond the two that you provide for free. It's bad enough that you guys attack them and retaliate for trying to unionize against your corporate greed. 

Unless you are willing to raise their hourly income, you should not force them to stop using the Starbucks shirts that they already purchased before this policy change. It's bad enough that you charged them for those specialty shirts in the first place. 

If you want to know what would make us happy as customers, it would be for you guys to drop your exorbitant prices. Your frappuccinos should not cost more than $5 for a large, $4.50 for a medium, $4.00 for a small. Hot coffees, iced coffees, tea should never be more than $3.00, and specialty hot drinks should never be more than $4.00.  If your prices were more reasonable, we would be able to go to your stores daily. You would make a killing out of sheer volume alone, because now you're appealing to the poor, the middle class, and the rich. More customers on a daily basis equals more profit; it is very simple math.

Another thing that would make us extremely happy is if you freely allow the unionization efforts to move forward and negotiate with them in a reasonable manner. You wouldn't have the profit margins that you currently have if it wasn't for your hard-working, dedicated employees. Show them the appreciation that they deserve. 

And lastly, it would please us greatly if you took a paycut and stopped making a ridiculous amount of money. Don't be greedy; you do not need that much money to live a comfortable, lavish lifestyle. The wealth needs to be distributed to the employees from the bottom up. Your supervisors, managers, and all other employees deserve raises as well. 

The days of us paying $6-7 a drink or more are over. I will ban Starbucks for as long as it takes until you do right by your employees. 

I will be encouraging everyone to submit these same requests non-stop until you effectuate real change in this company. 

Thank you for your time, and God bless. ",9,1745106806.0,starbucks,2,0.74,False

This is my first post here, and I am new to Reddit, and it's a sad one. I am just posting to document the issue. I built this PC on March 22, and it ran so well. While I was drinking my coffee this morning, however, my PC froze, and I couldn't get it to post anymore. I get 00 on Diag LED. I was able to Flashback the board and change different bios. I also removed my GPU and tried one stick of memory, and swapped it when it didn't post and had  00 on my post codes. I added photos just in case you guys can see something I didn't see. I also removed and re-inserted the CPU in case it somehow shifted inside the socket. I also tried to boot with another PSU. I can not try another CPU or Motherboard as I do not have one lying around.

I (21M) am a college student very interested in a girl (22/3F) that I am in the same program with. She is clearly very passionate, a motivated student, funny, and has similar career interests as I do. The only time I really see her is in the lounge at our school, where we have chatted and had longish, friendly conversations. I don't feel a particular romantic ""chemistry"" between us, but I think we are both kind of awkward people and we don't know each other super well, so I don't think that's to be unexpected. We recently both attended a ceremony for our program and won two of the same awards (she was the only person that night who won three awards, which I thought was super impressive!). I was able to grab the last open seat at the table she was sitting at too, so we got to chat a little while we were there. When we took award photos together, she put her arm around me (not touching) which made me more flustered than it should have... But these conversations in the school lounge and interaction at the ceremony are the only times we've chatted, so I don't know if it's too forward to ask her out. I'm seeing her on Tuesday at a school event and was thinking of telling her I'd like to get to know her better and asking if I could buy her dinner. But is dinner too much? Should I ask if she'd like to go to coffee or drinks instead? Do we not know each other well enough for me to ask anyway? I'm definitely overthinking this, but I don't want to blow my shot if I have one.

TLDR: I am super impressed by a girl in my program and want to ask her out, but we don't know each other very well. ",1,1745106528.0,dating_advice,2,0.67,False
1k39k7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1k39k7f/whats_behind_atriocs_antimiddle_eastern/,What's behind Atrioc's anti-Middle Eastern discrimination?,"Hi guys, I dont mean this in a hateful way, but hear me out. I honestly just want to hear big A out cus I am honestly just curious.

Atrioc is a geopolitics/economics/business guy, covering global news mostly around business and american news, but also talking about global and non business news. things such as Russia-Ukraine, BRICS, corruption, major scandals etc, and of course China.

When October 7th and subsequently everything after that happened, I was waiting video by video for him to say something about it. Curiously, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, nothing. To this day, it has never been mentioned or brought up, except once when Atrioc was responding to some random ironic comment from a chatter.

7/10 was honestly a multi-decade defining event, not only was it the most talked about issue for at least the following 6-8 months, but it sparked major protests, backlashes, boycotts etc that were never covered once. It is not an overstatement to sayit could have caused the largest war seen there in decades, if not centuries, especially if Iran, Jordan and Egypt got involved (due to the concerns of the leaders alone), let alone the West Bank too (that would have been ugly).

Analysis of the 2024 POTUS election? No mention, despite the fact that Gaza arguably lost Harris the presidency ([almost 1/3 of 2020](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/biden-voters-passed-kamala-harris-because-gaza-new-poll-shows) Biden voters didnt vote Harris again bc of her stance on Gaza; [polls from PA, ](https://zeteo.com/p/poll-harris-democrats-gaza-ceasefire-arms-embargo)GA, MI, AZ showed she could have flipped them (and won the presidency) if she changed her stance on Gaza).

Discussion of the dropping value of companies like Starbucks? Not a word mentioned about the Anti Israel boycotts, despite even the CEO Brian Niccol [himself admitting](https://www.facebook.com/bloombergbusiness/videos/starbucks-ceo-says-gaza-related-boycotts-are-hurting-the-brand/1522589325087977/) so.

The Columbia encampents were huge. They then spread not just to so many different US universities but also all across the globe, especially Europe too. Not a word.

Mahmoud Khalil is being arrested for protesting and excercising his free speech. Once more not a word.

Trumps god awful plan to create a Riviera. Nothing.

I could go on with the Gaza stuff, but let me pivot. Why did I say Middle East, and not just Palestine/Gaza?

Well, another also multi-decade defining event happened at the end of last year- the toppling of the Syrian dictator Bashar Al Assad. I honestly am not sugar coating it when I say its impacts will reverb for decades, but I am not here to discuss that. The thing is, that also made global news for a few weeks, not just because of how crazy it was but also the speed. Again, nothing mentioned by Atrioc. The most we got was him watching the Vox year in review and him leaving up like 4 seconds of the video where Vox includes the Syrian revolution stuff.

More recently, after the group chat fiasco where they added the senior editor to the war cabinet group chat, I was thinking to myself 'wow, this feels like a weird video' wondering why. I then clocked that this was the first time he had ever mentioned anything to do with Yemen, probably the 3rd or 4th time ever mentioning anything Middle Eastern related, and it was only because it was related to America.

Turkish riots, protests and arrests. Nothing.

Iran also had large scale protests for months. Again nothing.

I am not expecting many episodes in a row about this or to suddenly turn into a Middle Eastern analytical channel, but if he can discuss other countries every now and then for stories that are DEFINITELY less important, why not these?

I know Atrioc is pretty liberal and lives in LA, so it is unlikely due to racism (cant tell for sure ofc but I doubt it). He is also not obliged to run anything on his channel, it is his own content after all. I am not trying to bash him or to insult him, I am genuinly just dumbfounded- why would someone who pretty much just covers news on his channel- albeit mainly business/America centred- not even mention these stories once? Especially the Syrian revolt and ESPECIALLY what is going on in Gaza. I am honestly just very confused. THanks for listening glizzy glizzy coffee cow

edit: forgot to say but I have been an Atrioc enthusiast since his Riot v Blizzard video some years back, watched most of his vids multiple times and I could be wrong but I can only remember that kind of stuff being mentioned (in its own proper segment) once, when he was discussing Saudi Arabias Mukaab project (this was in a video that was entirely designed to cover every area of the world though)",0,1745106236.0,atrioc,33,0.36,False

This might be long, but I need to get this out. I‚Äôm not looking for pity‚ÄîI just genuinely don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing the right thing, and maybe someone out there has clarity that I can‚Äôt find in myself.

Back in January, I started a placement (internship) at a non-profit agency that supports vulnerable populations. I met someone there‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her Abby(not her real name). She‚Äôs an employee at the agency, but she isn‚Äôt my supervisor or evaluator. And before people jump to conclusions: this isn‚Äôt unethical, not in this case. Our agency doesn‚Äôt even have a formal ‚Äúconflict of interest‚Äù policy. In fact, several employees are related (mothers and daughters, siblings, even working the same shifts), and almost every staff member is aware of the bond we share. Some, including people from HR department even assume we‚Äôre already in a relationship. So, this isn‚Äôt about policy or professionalism. It‚Äôs about what‚Äôs happening inside my heart.

Abby and I connected from day one. Something clicked. I‚Äôm not someone who lets people in easily‚Äîin the past 6 years, I haven‚Äôt let anyone get close to me like this. But she just‚Ä¶ did it, effortlessly. She saw me in a way no one else has. And I saw her too‚Äînot just as a beautiful woman but as a rare soul, someone with emotional depth, strength, and softness I never knew I was searching for.

Over time, we became closer. She confided in me‚Äîdeep, personal things. Stuff she told me she‚Äôs never even told her family or closest friends. Uncomfortable truths about her past, her grief, her pain. Things you don‚Äôt share unless you trust someone to the core. And she trusted me. She once told me that I‚Äôm the only person she feels completely safe with‚Äîsomeone she can say anything to and know I‚Äôll never judge or repeat it. And I never will.

And it‚Äôs not just about emotional intimacy. There‚Äôs a comfort in our silences too. She brings me coffee on shift without me asking, asks me before breaks if I want anything from Tim‚Äôs. From a group of 12 students from different colleges, I‚Äôm the only one she‚Äôs close to. She only works with me. Even on days we‚Äôve had tension and didn‚Äôt talk, she would call me on the walkie and ask me to come work with her at another location, knowing I couldn‚Äôt say no to a staff request. We‚Äôd still sit in silence but be together.

Some of the (really personal)things she‚Äôs shared with me happened in the most private spaces‚Äîlike a locked room in the basement that can‚Äôt be opened from the outside. That‚Äôs how deeply she trusts me. If I were in her place, I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd ever open up like that to someone else. And I keep asking myself: what did she see in me that made her feel safe like that?

And then there‚Äôs me. I‚Äôve never cooked for anyone before in my life, but I cooked for her. I‚Äôve written poems about her‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt know they were about her until recently when I finally sent her a long message saying goodbye. I confessed my feelings for her twice. She didn‚Äôt say yes either time‚Äîbut she also never let me walk away. Instead, we got closer. She didn‚Äôt respond directly to that message, but the next day, when I showed up to placement, she came right up to me, smiling, acting like nothing had happened last night. She talked to me normally, asked me how I was. I was too embarrassed to even look her in the eyes, couldn‚Äôt even talked to her the whole day, but she carried the weight of our bond like it wasn‚Äôt broken.

Later, I found out‚Äîfrom a trusted source, someone on my side‚Äîthat she cried when I left that day because I didn‚Äôt talk to her like usual, and i still haven‚Äôt forgiven myself for that behaviour. She never told me that herself. A couple days later, we had a deep phone conversation late at night, and I mentioned how I‚Äôll have to leave this city after graduation and move to a different province for my permanent residency (PR). She cried again, not on the phone but later. Again, I didn‚Äôt find out from her directly.

Since then, we‚Äôve been talking on the phone almost every night. Hours-long conversations. Comfort, vulnerability, laughter. She‚Äôs shared how I‚Äôm the only student in 6 years and over 150 studenst that she had to undertook got close to. I was the only one she answered during her nephew‚Äôs funeral. The only one she emotionally opened up to. She even joked once about marrying me just to keep me from moving away, or keeping me locked in her basement so I wouldn‚Äôt leave. It sounds funny, but behind those jokes was something‚Ä¶ soft. Real.

But here‚Äôs the hard truth‚ÄîI have to leave. I‚Äôm an international student. After this semester, I‚Äôll have to move to another province to build my future and apply for PR. I‚Äôm changing fields entirely, I have to. That means not just leaving the city but probably never seeing her again. Thousands of miles. Different time zones. A connection like this‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt survive distance like that‚Äînot when it‚Äôs undefined and unspoken.

And I think the more I stay in touch with her, even just online, the more I‚Äôll hold on. The more I‚Äôll hope. And the more I‚Äôll ruin the friendship we do have. I‚Äôve already confessed twice‚ÄîI messed it up already‚Äîand she still held onto it. Even while grieving, even while leaving her job (she‚Äôs on her 3-week notice), even while dealing with her pain, she never pushed me away.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm choosing to walk away after my last day. Because I‚Äôm not going to add to her overwhelm. I‚Äôm not going to be a weight on her when she‚Äôs already carrying so much. I want to protect this bond, even if it means letting it go before it gets destroyed by life, distance, or silence. But I‚Äôm also terrified.

Because I know how this goes. We‚Äôll talk for a while. Then one day, one missed call, one awkward silence, and it‚Äôll fade. We‚Äôll become strangers‚Äîbut with memories now. And those memories? They‚Äôre too beautiful to forget. So beautiful, they‚Äôll probably haunt me for years. Maybe forever. So a part of me also wants to confess to her one last time on the last day. Because if we could be one, i am willing to stay here in Ontario. for my PR? That‚Äôs my headache, I‚Äôll get it by any means possible, wether it‚Äôll be ethical or not, because i know if she‚Äôs standing next to me, i can achieve anything I want and also make the same changes to her life too. As i never saw this connection as timepass or temporary, from the first moment i thought of taking it together till the grave, and i am a man of my words.

She once told me she‚Äôs never let anyone this close in her life. And I haven‚Äôt either. That makes this feel sacred. And I don‚Äôt know how to say goodbye to something sacred. I even wrote a 3-page letter I planned to give her‚Äîa final confession of everything I feel. It includes poems I never shared before, and it‚Äôs not about lust or attraction. It‚Äôs about her emotional strength, her soul, and how she saw me when no one else did.

But now I don‚Äôt even know if I should give her that letter. Or walk away in silence. Or block her after leaving because staying will only keep reopening this wound. I‚Äôll keep messing up the friendship with feelings. I‚Äôve already done that twice, and she still held onto it‚Äîeven with her own pain to carry.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm seriously confused now. Because maybe she‚Äôs overwhelmed, and I‚Äôm not a benefit to her life right now‚Äîjust another thing that adds weight. But I don‚Äôt want to give up on this if there‚Äôs any chance to hold onto it, the right way.

So, if anyone‚Äôs ever been in this position‚Äîeither in her shoes or mine‚Äîplease help me understand. Is there something here? What would you do? Should I give her that letter? Should I say goodbye or stay in touch? Or should I let go for good, even if it rips me apart?

Thank you if you read all this. I just needed to put it somewhere.",1,1745106157.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

‚ÄúI just feel like I‚Äôm right,‚Äù claims sensory-devoid citizen

APRIL 19, 2025 | THE ONION

In a groundbreaking case that has both baffled scientists and validated internet comment sections, 28-year-old Devon Krantz‚Äîwho was born without sight, hearing, taste, touch, or smell‚Äîhas nonetheless managed to develop unwavering, loudly shared opinions on nearly every subject imaginable.

Despite lacking any traditional form of sensory input, Krantz has already taken strong stances on the best pizza toppings (‚Äúanchovies are a crime‚Äù), the quality of modern cinema (‚Äúthey just don‚Äôt make them like they used to‚Äù), and the geopolitical implications of balloon-based surveillance.

‚ÄúDevon has never seen a screen, heard a voice, or experienced the sensation of temperature,‚Äù said Dr. Linh Nguyen, a leading neuroscientist. ‚ÄúAnd yet somehow they just know the government is hiding aliens in a Chili‚Äôs parking lot.‚Äù

According to friends‚Äîwho admit they have no idea how Krantz perceives them‚Äîcommunication with Devon is ‚Äúmysteriously consistent‚Äù with most people on Twitter: mostly one-way, wildly confident, and loosely based on vibes.

‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt see, hear, or touch anything, but he still thinks pineapple on pizza is a war crime,‚Äù said roommate Blake Jordan. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know how he knows what pizza is.‚Äù

Inexplicably, Krantz has also amassed a small but devoted podcast following.

The method of recording remains unclear.

###Here are some choice quotes from Devon Krantz, the man with no senses but all the takes:

‚∏ª

‚ÄúLook, I may not have tasted coffee, but I know Starbucks is selling lies in a cup.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe moon landing was fake. I haven‚Äôt seen it‚Äîbut that just makes me more objective.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople say I live in a bubble. I say: you live in a bubble‚ÄîI am the void.‚Äù

‚ÄúI may not sense your energy, but it‚Äôs giving weak.‚Äù

‚ÄúLove is fake. I don‚Äôt need to feel anything to know that.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery time someone brings up climate change, I just ask: ‚ÄòHave you ever actually felt the climate?‚Äô No? Then sit down.‚Äù

‚ÄúPineapple on pizza is a violation of the Geneva Conventions. I don‚Äôt need a tongue to understand war crimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúCancel culture is real. I was canceled at birth‚Äîby all five senses.‚Äù

3rd Person POV

The Yura University lecture hall buzzed with the low hum of students shuffling papers and laptops, the late afternoon sun slanting through tall windows. Fern sat at a table near the back, her glasses fogged from rushing across campus, her flannel sleeve rolled up as she scribbled notes for a film studies project. Anthony slid into the seat beside her, his dark curls falling into his eyes, a shy smile tugging at his lips. Their professor had paired them to analyze a classic sci-fi flick, Blade Runner, and the task felt like a small gift amid the campus‚Äôs simmering tension. The slasher‚Äôs shadow‚Äîtwo murders, a smiley face mask, and no suspect‚Äîloomed, but here, in the quiet of collaboration, Fern found a flicker of normalcy.

Anthony opened his laptop, pulling up a scene from the film. ‚ÄúI love how it‚Äôs all vibes‚Äîneon, rain, existential dread,‚Äù he said, his voice soft but eager. Fern nodded, pushing up her glasses. ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs like our city, but dystopian.‚Äù Their banter flowed easily, trading thoughts on replicants and identity, their shy laughs echoing the spark from Aspen‚Äôs party. Anthony sketched a storyboard, his pencil swift, while Fern typed up their outline, her fingers pausing when their hands brushed reaching for a pen. 

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù they said in unison, blushing, then laughing. The project wasn‚Äôt due for a week, but they lingered after class, debating favorite scenes over vending machine coffee, the slasher‚Äôs threat momentarily distant. Anthony‚Äôs earnestness made Fern‚Äôs heart lift, though a nagging doubt‚Äîcould anyone be trusted?‚Äîkept her guarded.
Later that evening, Fern met Hunter at Neon Caf√©, the Glitch Club‚Äôs usual haunt, for what Fern had jokingly called a ‚Äúfriendship date.‚Äù The caf√© glowed with mismatched lamps and neon signs, its vibe a cozy contrast to the city‚Äôs sharp edges. 

Hunter sat in a corner booth, her hoodie swallowing her frame, a sci-fi novel open but unread. Her shy smile bloomed when Fern slid in across from her, setting down two steaming mochas. ‚ÄúI got extra whipped cream,‚Äù Fern said, grinning, and Hunter‚Äôs quiet laugh warmed the air. They‚Äôd bonded in the hallway weeks ago, and Fern sensed Hunter‚Äôs need for connection, her anti-social shell cracking under Fern‚Äôs kindness.
Over mochas and a shared plate of fries, they talked‚Äîfirst about classes, then deeper. Hunter admitted her love for dystopian books, her voice soft but animated. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre scary, but‚Ä¶ hopeful, you know? People keep fighting.‚Äù Fern nodded, stirring her drink. ‚ÄúLike us, with all this slasher stuff.‚Äù Hunter‚Äôs eyes flickered, the murders a shared weight.

 Fern steered the conversation lighter, asking about Hunter‚Äôs favorite movies, and Hunter‚Äôs passion spilled out, her usual reserve melting. They swapped stories of childhood‚ÄîFern‚Äôs tinkering with her dad‚Äôs electronics, Hunter‚Äôs murals before life dimmed her spark. ‚ÄúYou should paint again,‚Äù Fern said, earnest. Hunter blushed, ducking her head. ‚ÄúMaybe. With you around, I feel‚Ä¶ braver.‚Äù

The caf√©‚Äôs jukebox played lo-fi beats, and Fern felt a sisterly pull toward Hunter, like she‚Äôd found someone who saw the world through a similar lens. They laughed over a fry-dipping contest, Hunter‚Äôs giggles rare and bright, but the slasher‚Äôs presence crept in. A TV in the corner flashed a news update: no new murders, but police were still questioning students, including the Glitch Club. Hunter‚Äôs fingers tightened around her mug. ‚ÄúI saw you with Ana,‚Äù she said quietly, referencing the hallway fight. ‚ÄúYou were so strong, but‚Ä¶ you looked sad after.‚Äù Fern sighed, her guilt resurfacing. ‚ÄúI hurt her, Hunter. I didn‚Äôt mean to.‚Äù Hunter‚Äôs gaze was steady, kind. ‚ÄúYou cared. That‚Äôs what matters.‚Äù

They left the caf√© as dusk settled, the city‚Äôs neon skyline pulsing. Fern walked Hunter to her dorm, their steps slow, savoring the ease between them. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing this again,‚Äù Fern declared, and Hunter nodded, her smile genuine. ‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù As Hunter disappeared inside, Fern‚Äôs phone buzzed‚Äîa text from Anthony: Found a cool Blade Runner article. Wanna chat tomorrow? She smiled, typing Yes! But the news update lingered, the smiley face mask a ghost in her mind. Her moments with Anthony and Hunter were bright spots, but the killer was still out there, and Fern couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that normalcy was a fragile illusion, ready to shatter.",1,1745105885.0,SkullyBoy,0,1.0,False

After 15 years leading construction on massive projects for Google, Apple, Starbucks, and WeWork, my wife and I left that world behind to build something more personal and grounded, (and to raise our son in a more meaningful way).

We're creating a thoughtful micro resort in coastal Maine, designed to feel like a crafted retreat hidden in the trees. Phase 1 will include 5 architecturally distinctive cabins and a hydrotherapy area with a sauna, hot tub, and cold plunge. Future phases will add a coffee bar, local craft mercantile, and event capabilities for small weddings, retreats, and gatherings. All will be environmentally low-impact and Phase 2 will focus on taking the property to net-zero energy. 

We‚Äôre not trying to be a glampground or a hotel ‚Äî this is a landscape hotel at a micro scale: intentional, high-touch, experience-led, with a high level of personalized hospitality.

We‚Äôve:

* Secured a $200k land acquisition partner
* Started the process of extracting $400k from our personal 401(k)s. We‚Äôve got skin in the game!
* Completed our full business plan, website, projections, deck, temp branding, etc.
* Lined up multiple prefab cabin suppliers and are finalizing custom-built versions to head off the tariff situation.
* Started working with a top local real estate agent to find property (20+ acres)
* Started to gather private investment
* Engaged with SBA lenders and structured our business to be finance-ready

**Where we need help:** We‚Äôre looking for aligned private equity or individual investors to reduce or eliminate our need for SBA financing (it‚Äôs just so restrictive and cumbersome). We‚Äôve had great early investor interest but want to broaden our reach and connect with those who believe in this kind of thoughtful, hospitality-forward development. In order to eliminate the need for SBA financing we‚Äôd need to raise another **$1M.**

If anyone here has experience raising for hospitality at this scale, or knows investors who are drawn to design-forward real estate, I‚Äôd love to connect. Also happy to share any insights with regards to large-scale commercial construction if anyone has a need for it.

For context, I'm gay (19M) ‚Äî which is very relevant here ‚Äî and I grew up in an extremely Mormon household. When I say extremely Mormon, I mean my dad is a Stake President (a very high church position), he worked for the church for nearly 30 years, and was a bishop three different times before that. My mom works at both the missionary training center and the temple, and my grandpa is a Patriarch. Our house is basically a Mormon shrine, filled with paintings of Jesus, temples, and scriptures on the walls.

Growing up, LGBTQ people were talked about with disgust and weirdness in my home. From a young age, I acted a little ""different""‚Äî I was a little more feminine, probably because I spent more time with my twin sister and her friends (since the neighborhood boys weren't friendly to me). My mom would regularly tell me that the way I walked and talked was ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and ‚Äúboys don‚Äôt do that.‚Äù I was so ashamed that for months on end I‚Äôd spend hours practicing how to walk and talk in the shower to come across more masculine.

As I got older, and struggled with severe mental health issues mostly tied to self-worth and self-acceptance, and after a suicide attempt, I realized I needed to start living for myself. A lot of my dreams and values ‚Äî things like my music career, my friendships, recreational drinking, and occasional marijuana use ‚Äî were things my parents would never approve of for religious reasons.

From about age 16 on, I kept to myself and quietly did what made me happy. I lied to them about simple stuff like going for coffee with friends, because growing up, they tracked my electronics, monitored my phone, and would‚Äôve freaked out over harmless things like hanging out with clearly non-Mormon friends, drinking coffee, seeing R-rated movies, or going on a date with a guy. It wasn‚Äôt like I was doing anything crazy or dangerous. Meanwhile, I was a straight-A student, senior class president, and heavily involved in extracurriculars.

Now I‚Äôm in college, and I‚Äôve kept my personal life private. But when I visit home, my parents inevitably start religious conversations or ask about my life. A few weeks ago, my buddy's mom told my grandpa that I'd drank alcohol and used recreational drugs. Of course, that got back to my mom, and they baited me into coming home to talk about ""housing for the next school year"". When I got home, they ambushed me about how I was ruining my life. They weren't aggressive, just dramatic and concerned.

I explained that this wasn‚Äôt new, and that I was doing great ‚Äî I‚Äôm excelling in school, just won first place at a state ethics and policy debate, and I‚Äôm competing at nationals soon. I told them I think deeply about my choices and that I‚Äôm happy with my life. But they were clearly upset that I hadn‚Äôt been ‚Äútransparent‚Äù about this with them sooner. I explained that I had always kept to myself, and that they shouldn't be surprised that they didn't know about this. This upset them even more, and me, also being upset over the fact they had baited me into coming home to ""talk about housing"" only for them to admit that they just wanted me there so they ambush me about drug and alcohol usage, left.

Then, just last week, I visited home again. Another religious conversation started, and I maturely told them (as I have many times) that I don‚Äôt agree with or respect some of their beliefs because I find them harmful and dehumanizing ‚Äî though they have every right to believe whatever they want.
They got defensive, asking what I meant by ‚Äúharmful and dehumanizing.‚Äù One example I gave was their beliefs about LGBTQ people. It‚Äôs worth mentioning here ‚Äî I‚Äôve never officially come out to them. I don‚Äôt feel like I owe them that, and frankly, I don‚Äôt feel safe doing it. Especially since it was their beliefs and indoctrination that made me hate myself for so long, and because they still openly think same-sex relationships are wrong and extremely sinful.

Whenever these topics come up, we talk in third person (because I haven't come out to them), which is really awkward, since they KNOW I'm gay. I told them that if they¬†ever ""had a gay child"", it would be unfair to blame the child for not wanting to bring a partner home if they were expected to act ‚Äúplatonic.‚Äù They said ""if they had a gay child"", they‚Äôd expect them to still be transparent about their personal and love life, and ‚Äúrespect their beliefs‚Äù by hiding any affection with a partner when they visit home.

I explained that if their expectations and beliefs toward an LGBTQ child‚Äôs life and relationships were dehumanizing, it made total sense why that child wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable being open, or bringing a partner to family events. I also said people don‚Äôt owe anyone, including parents, access to their personal lives ‚Äî it‚Äôs a matter of feeling safe and respected.

They then accused me of being secretive, disrespectful, immoral, and intentionally hurting them by not being ‚Äútransparent‚Äù about my lifestyle and beliefs.

I told them point-blank: I don‚Äôt owe anyone personal details about my life if I don‚Äôt feel safe or comfortable.

For context, I have many mormon friends (I am in the most mormon part of Utah so it feels like I don't really have a choice), who know that I am gay, and whom I am somewhat open about my personal life with. I still don't support many of their beliefs, and I'll admit I still don't feel safe with many of them (and will likely find new, more supportive friends over time), but it's easier for me to be open with them because what they believe doesn't really effect me, and never did growing up since I didn't know most of them. With my parents, it feels different.

Now they‚Äôre upset, saying this is me choosing to hurt them, and by not being transparent and lying, I am actively destroying the relationship.

His little sister was my best friend throughout the years growing up and when I was 11 years old my family stoped attending their church (which I where I knew them from) and we didn't go back until this year's Christmas Eve service where I 17F reconnected with him 18M. 

His sister, him, and I met up a few times then it switched to just me and him meeting up. We've exchanged books, video games, movies, music, even art/creative outlets. This is different than any other way I've gotten to know a person. Him being a childhood crush of mine (best friend's older brother and all) and someone I generally looked up to makes this whole thing feel surreal. 

I'm not the type to have crushes, and I hate vulnerability-which is where the problem lies-I think of him as one of the smartest, most knowledgable, and funniest people I know. He's incredibly articulate and is very skilled in rhetoric. He's won every strategy game we've played together, he's musically talented. He just seems to be good at everything. He deserves the world, or at least someone better than me. My family and friends say I'm out of his league (partially because he's a total nerd, but it's honestly something I adore about him). I've been told I'm beautiful by family and friends, I don't where makeup or dress up ever, but I've gotten complements from strangers to, and this is a reason some people in my life think I could do better. They don't know him though. (plus, I quite like his unique style)

With that said, I feel like I'm the lucky one in our dynamic. After the first time we hung out one on one, I drove away from the coffee shop with one thought: ""why does he give me the time of day."" Which is funny because the second time, he said he was surprised I suggested we met again because he just recalls us talking about math and figured I wouldn't want another round of that. I feel lucky to recieve his attention, I've found myself quite endearing of him as a person (the more I get to know him the more I think he's out of my league). I feel like it's a matter of time before he becomes bored of me. 

I've talked to his sister about this stuff too. She says that it seems like I bring something soft out of him, her words where ""teddy bear,"" whatever that means. Their parents approached her and asked her opinion on us and the words they used to describe our dynamic is ""odd"" and ""quirky."" 

tldr: childhood best friend's older brother has reentered my life and is someone I adore. Despite mutual displayed interest, I feel like he's better than me and I don't know what to do about this.",1,1745105218.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

A friend of mine let's call him Mark from my country which is on the same uni course as me was flying back to my country with me on Christmas break and as we were chatting on the plane he told me that one of the girls that where on the same flight as us was a childhood friend of his but I didn't ask who, so after the Christmas break I invited him over for coffee and asked him in a subtle way who that friend of his was and to my surprise it was Jane.

We became gym buddies with Mark and while talking I told him that I've seen his friend Jane around and she is kind of pretty, he answered that yes he knows and that back in our country a lot of people tried to take advantage of him to get close to her. I didn't want to be one of those guys so I didn't know what to do.

A week after I mustered the courage and found the right words to tell him how I liked his friend Jane and how I had no way of getting close to her since I have no mutual friends and told him that if he doesn't want to help me I won't mind since I don't want to ruin our friendship. Thankfully, he didn't take it the wrong way and told me that he could easily set up an outing with her and a few other friends and invite me with them, he also told me that she is innocent and to not make a fool of him.

Fast forward to a day before valentines day, I didn't bring up that topic with him again since I didn't want to be annoying, that day 13th Febuary 12pm I was waiting for the elevator after leaving the laundry room and heard 2 female voices speaking my home language coming toward the elevator, to my surprise it was Jane and one of her friends, It was my chance to say something or start small talk but at that time I got anxious and thought that it would be creepy a guy who has never spoken to her before start chatting with her all of a sudden, so I didn't even say a hello and stared at my phone until they left, I got really mad at myself that night since that might have been my only chance.

The next day, valentines day comes we decided with my friends that we should buy two bottles of whiskey and a few snacks just for fun. It was the worst Idea of our my life I got blackout drunk and food poisoning was throwing up for 5 hours straight and because of what happened the night before in the elevator I was mad and was hurting myself physically keep in mind I don't recall anything from that night only what my friends told me. One of my friends told me that he was alone with me in the bathroom and I told him that I was alone with Jane in the elevator and didn't speak to her.

2 months pass, because of what happened I broke my no pmo streak at day 30 which I deeply regret, my friend Mark still hasn't brought that topic up since. I decided to ask him again and he told me that he would set something up like he said before but still nothing.

2 weeks before Easter break, there was a voting in another town where all the people from my country could go to for free, I went with my friend group voted and while leaving I found my friend Mark with Jane and their friend group on the same train as my friend group I greeted him but they went and sat elsewhere so I couldn't go to them. I called him up after we came back just to chat, I told him ""aren't you going to say that I'm an idiot since I didn't make the effort to come talk to her while she was with you since I already told you that I liked her?"". He said that he gets why I couldn't come because I was with another friend group and then asked me: 

Mark - ""Do you think that you have a chance with her?""

Me - ""Since I don't really know her that well you are the one that can actually tell if I have a chance or not""

Mark - ""After some of the things you told me, you might be too innocent for her, but I am willing to set up a meet up of some sort maybe we could go shopping together""

That answer of his got me both excited and confused since he previously said that she might be too innocent for me and that she is like a sister to him.

A few days after the phone call he messaged me and told me that he would send her a message and ask her to come shopping with us and bring a friend, the weekend goes by and my friend didn't tell me to go shopping with them so on Monday I asked him if he still wanted to go shopping with me, he said yes and told me that she wasn't able to come with us but forgot to tell me. He also implied that I should stop trying to get with her since she might play hard to get. Thst actually ruined my mental health and I became lost and didn't know what else to do.

5 days before we leave for Christmas break me and my friends were planning to go out and we where all at the accommodations lobby, one of my friends let's call him Jake who knows the situation saw her behind me sitting at the reception desk with one of her friends but I didn't know what I should do so I didn't do anything.
When we went back home Jake told me that I should have gone up to them and said hi since no one else went, I thought thst would be creepy but then he told me that would come up as confidence which changed my whole mindset but  I still missed that opportunity because of my ignorance.

2 days before departing I couldn't sleep because of how mad I was with myself for not being able to even say a hello in 3 months so I was hearing motivational speeches for 8 hours straight and walking around in my room without a shirt with an open window in freezing cold weather just to punish myself and knew that I couldn't rely on anyone but myself anymore.

Here comes the good part, the night before departing I was going to do my laundry as I went into the laundry room I saw her sitting there alone on her phone, she didn't notice me coming in so I didn't say anything, while I was filling up the washing machine I was thinking of what to say to her I thought of what my friend Jake said that just by starting small talk I would show confidence and what those motivational speeches were saying 8 hours straight, I turned around and said:
Me - ""Hey, how have you been?""
Jane - ""Fine, how about you?""
Me - ""Fine, thank you""
Me - ""Are you finishing off with the dryer now?""
Jane - ""No, I am waiting for the washing machine to finish and then I'll use the dryer""
Me - ""OK can I tell you something but we should keep it between us?""
Jane - ""Yes, what is it?""
Me - showed her a method of how to use laundry machine and dryer for free which works 50% of the time

She thanked me I said goodbye and I left, I couldn't say anything else, I felt that my feet were going to stop working,  I've never felt this much anxiety before.

I later found out that she is going to be on the same flight as me back and we are going to be back to uni for another month.

Redditors I need your help how should I proceed without messing things up?

TL;DR: I'm a 20M first-year international student with zero dating experience. I developed a crush on a girl (Jane) from my home country, but we have no mutual friends. A mutual friend (Mark) offered to set something up but never followed through. I missed multiple chances to talk to her due to anxiety, which really affected my mental health. Eventually, the night before flying home for Easter, I finally had a short, friendly convo with her in the laundry room. I just found out we'll be on the same flight back and will be at uni for one more month. How should I proceed without being creepy or ruining my chances?",0,1745104934.0,dating_advice,8,0.5,False

1k3920r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_spirosoma/comments/1k3920r/strictly_for_test_purposes/,Strictly for test purposes.,"The island of Martinique rests within the broader Caribbean archipelago, positioned along the eastern arc of the Lesser Antilles between Dominica to the north and St. Lucia to the south. The island, measuring approximately 1,128 square kilometers, formed through volcanic processes that began millions of years ago on the Caribbean seafloor, resulting in a landscape characterized primarily by rugged mountains and lush tropical rainforest. By the turn of the 20th century, Martinique had grown to be a prized French colonial possession. It had been under French rule since 1635, with only brief breaks during the Napoleonic Wars, and produced profitable export goods like coffee, sugar, and rum. Mount Pele√® is situated on the island's northern tip and rises 1,397 meters (4,583 feet) above sea level. Pel√©e, a conical stratovolcano formed by layers of hardened lava, pumice, and ash, was known for its sporadic eruptions, including the most well-known one in 1851. Its steep slopes, covered in lush tropical vegetation at lower elevations, gradually yielded to barren terrain near the summit, where fumaroles occasionally emitted wisps of steam and sulfurous gases.

The city of Saint-Pierre, which was founded in 1635 by French colonists, evolved into a bustling commercial and cultural centre of Martinique, earning the nickname ""The Paris of the Lesser Antilles."" The city featured elegant public buildings, including a theatre, various commercial establishments, religious structures, including the Cathedral of Notre Dame du Bon Port, and affluent residential areas with homes distinguished by red-tiled roofs and wrought-iron balconies. It hosted a population of approximately 30,000 in 1902, comprised mainly of Europeans, people of African descent and those of mixed ancestry. The city was located at the foot of Mount Pel√©e, along a gently curving bay on the northwest shore of the island, less than 8 kilometres from the summit of the volcano. Saint Pierre's residents saw Pel√©e only as a magnificent backdrop enhancing their city's appeal, not as the destructive force it would expose.

In January 1902, the volcano gradually began to reawaken. Around the mountain, locals started to notice strange occurrences: thin wisps of vapour rising from the crater every now and then, and faint rumbling sounds coming from deep within the earth. Despite being obvious, these early warning signs did not raise any alarms right away. The mountain had been comparatively quiet since the last eruption in 1851, and Martinique had previously seen minor volcanic activity without significant repercussions. By February the indicators started to show more clearly. Near the summit, hikers and farmers noted stronger sulphuric smells and more clearly visible fumaroles, openings in the crust of the earth releasing steam and gases. Some springs developed a bitter, mineral taste while the water in streams down from the mountain started to show raised temperatures. Wildlife behaviour also changed; birds abandoned nesting sites close to the summit and insects seemed in odd abundance at lower altitudes. March brought more changes as minor earthquakes felt in homes near the mountain started to rattle dishes even though they were not strong enough to damage. Usually occurring in brief clusters, these seismic events followed times of relative calm. Sadly, officials without established knowledge mostly ignored these warning signals. A column of dark material rose several hundred feet above the crater on April 23, marking the first notable ash emission. Louder explosions that were audible throughout northern Martinique occurred at the same time as this incident. The ash, which was carried by the dominant winds, covered the outskirts of Saint-Pierre with a fine grey powder that covered vegetation and buildings. Within a few days, the volcano's surrounding rural areas started to experience more significant ashfall, and crop damage and tainted water sources were reported by farmers. Animals exhibited distress by refusing to eat vegetation covered in ash. Seasonal rains combined with the accumulated ash to create unstable slopes in the mountains, resulting in a large number of small landslides.


By April 27, denser clouds of ash and steam began to emerge almost continuously from the mountain's crater. On the volcano's northern flank, a noticeable bulge developed, signifying that magma was rising beneath the surface. Louis Mouttet, the governor of the island, minimised the threat in spite of these alarming events. Mouttet assured residents that Saint-Pierre was safe and discouraged evacuation plans because of the impending important local elections and the economic stakes. 

The crater lake, which was once a popular tourist destination, started to boil violently on May 2. After combining with volcanic debris, the heated water broke through the crater rim and poured down the River Blanche valley. When this volcanic mudflow, or lahar, moved with such force, it destroyed a sugar mill and killed 23 workers. A tsunami caused by the mud flow continued to the sea, damaging Saint-Pierre's waterfront buildings but leaving no one dead inside the city. 

Activity increased even further from May 3rd to May 5th. In Saint-Pierre, constant ash emissions made the day turn into night, requiring the use of lamps at noon. With seismic vibrations powerful enough to shatter walls in buildings close to the mountain's base, loud explosions became the norm. Some buildings' roofs collapsed due to heavy ashfall, and the ash-filled air made breathing challenging. As telegraph lines broke under falling debris, communication with nearby islands became intermittent. The humanitarian crisis quickly worsened, as the population of Saint-Pierre ballooned as rural residents from the mountain slopes fled to the city for safety. As ash destroyed local agriculture and volcanic material tainted drinking water, food became scarce. Governor Mouttet continued reassuring the public, even relocating his family to Saint-Pierre to demonstrate his confidence in the city's safety.


A scientific commission that local officials hastily put together took a tour of the volcano's flanks on May 6. Although they acknowledged the gravity of the activity, their report did not suggest that Saint-Pierre be completely evacuated. This miscalculation, which was impacted by both political and economic considerations, would have disastrous results.

On May 8, 1902, at around 7:50 a.m., Mount Pel√©e went into its paroxysmal phase. Internal pressure and rising magma caused the northern flank of the volcano to collapse. Instead of a conventional vertical eruption, this caused an explosive lateral blast. Few witnesses survived to recount what happened next because it happened so quickly and violently. The mountain practically ""unzipped"" along its flank, causing a massive pressure wave to be released. At more than 100 miles per hour, this pyroclastic flow‚Äîa high-density mixture of superheated gases, ash, and rock fragments‚Äîrushed down the mountainside. As it moved four miles from the crater, the flow retained its cohesiveness despite internal temperatures approaching 1,000¬∞C (1,800¬∞F) in under two minutes.


This scorching cloud (later classified as a ""nue√® ardente"" or pyroclastic flow) encircled barriers, pierced structures, and instantly carbonised everything in its path when it hit Saint-Pierre. As flammable materials spread throughout the city due to the extreme heat, many secondary fires were started. Weaker structures were collapsed and windows were broken by the pressure wave that preceded the main flow. Ships in the harbour were flipped over by the impact, and the burning cloud burned the ships that were still upright. Approximately 30,000 people, including Governor Mouttet and his wife (which were reportedly found in the ruins of the government building they had been staying in) were killed in a span of 3 minutes. Few people made it out alive, chief among them Auguste Ciparis, a prisoner interned in a stone dungeon with inadequate ventilation that unintentionally offered adequate shelter from the intense heat. Leon Comp√®re-L√©andre, another survivor, survived because he lived on the outskirts of the city and acted quickly when he noticed the approaching cloud.

I do know about the crit for a crit, but honestly, I just want to know what writing is about, if it‚Äôs good or bad and where I‚Äôm at.

FYI, I‚Äôm not and English speaker, it‚Äôs not checked for spelling mistakes nor is it cleaned up. 

So here‚Äôs my story, that doesn‚Äôt have a name yet‚Äî-

-

This is me, you wondering probably who I am or why this is relevant, well it‚Äôs a question I honestly can‚Äôt answer and to be fair, I don‚Äôt even think my parents or people close to me would be able to. I was a simple boy, mostly, at times strange, but let‚Äôs face it, what child isn‚Äôt, especially a boy in the starting blocks of his puberty paired with some confusion about who or what he is, and where his journey will lead him in his life. Either way, let‚Äôs rewind a bit, around the time some people might find cute, around that time you began using this wobbly, flimsy, meatsausages below your belly, to be more exact, your legs, yes, exactly those things. I was always a curious child, and if I was a cat, probably dead, isn‚Äôt that the saying? Curiosity kills the‚Ä¶? Anyways, you understand. So there was me, that little unbothered, completly ignorant about possible dangers thing, walking and discovering every little thing in this world. We had a big garden, some lush forest and beautiful oak trees covering the borders of my parents perfectly mowed and cared for grass, and me, the child of some busy high valued people, I think you would call them rich, probably to rich because they never found time to actually care about anything that wasn‚Äôt remotely connected to business, decided the garden, the beautiful grass, cut to perfection, where most people would play golf on, in my larva state beeing to go regularly on my personal adventures, in this said area, yes the forest, not the grass.. only to be fetched again from the personal that was, how im still not quite sure to this day, the role of my parents? It seemed that way atleast. So you see, self preservation was never my thing, and it never concerned me, even to this day. You probably see where this is going, all this lead to exactly what you think, a lot of trouble, school was for that boy, that‚Äôs me if you forgot, never an easy task, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I wasn‚Äôt that ‚Äûslow‚Äú kid, everybody probably had in school. I was a pretty bright mind and mostly bored of the endless tests and utterly boring classes I had to endure. Who wouldn‚Äôt, private schools are really not that cool how everybody thinks they are, snobby little, excuse me for the words, but I do think it fits the description perfectly, shit kids, that are well to aware and care way to much about daddy‚Äôs money and status, pretty sure everybody knows these dickheads without ever stepping a foot inside those schools. So yes, that was my life, torn apart between boredom and annoying classmates that measure their dicks and achievements, however you wanna have any of this in your teenage years, with each other. So there was me, as earlier explained, confused on where life will lead me, it would‚Äôve been a nobrainer for a lot of people just to follow the family‚Äôs business and call it a day, not me, sitting in skyscrapers looking at a stupid monitor, talking to some people on the phones and meetings and probably getting frustrated with Laura the secretary or whatever her dumb name might be. I wanted more in this world, no ordinary life, something, just like my childhood, packed with careless, probably self harming adventures, well ordinary my life never was, but I think you‚Äôll catch the drift. After the awful years slowly passing by, I kinda got a hang of what I wanted for myself, history was always interesting for me, buried secrets, hidden treasures, no, this is not some of those story‚Äôs and movies - part 100, we‚Äôve all know and some love already. This isn‚Äôt the Hollywood magic or happy ends you‚Äôve all known, the Michael Bay hand twitching before the outro type of stuff, this is my story, my life‚Äôs story is a cluster fuck out of everything you‚Äôll imagine, highs and lows, ups and downs, shapes and rectangle‚Äôs, so probably nothing much your imagination can come up with, hence the reason you‚Äôre still listening to me and my story. Everything began to really kick off after my graduation, historian-archeologist, what a good awful name this is, the fancy ‚Äûinterdisciplinary‚Äú background guy - John. Yes I know, complain to my parents about the name they choose for me, never liked it either, but hey, what can you do about it‚Ä¶ well, in todays time there‚Äôs a lot possibilitys about identity I guess.. lets just skip that nonsense for the better, but as I said, complain to them, let‚Äôs continue. So either way, John, the Indiana Jones knock off, how some of you might think, and probably a bit narcissistic, counting in the fact I‚Äôm having a whole ass Monolog about myself for the next few hours, finally figured his life how it seemed, atleast I‚Äôve got my degree done in the field that interests me the most, finally could start where he wanted. Since this ain‚Äôt some Hollywood movie, the question is absolutely justified, where the fuck do I start? I mean sure, daddy‚Äôs got the money, probably knows some people that know some people, but, I was still a bit lost on how to make something out of it, all these years complaining about these fuckers and then calling in the same family bonuses? Didn‚Äôt seem right to me, so the only logical thing was to try and find some job, what I mean, I obviously studied for. Kinda worked actually, I even went and digged up some old vases and stuff, pretty neat, not what I had in mind when I started all this, but atleast it was connected with what I studied for I guess? That has to count for something right? Let‚Äôs fact check this, probably most of the jobs are not really what you imagine them to be, and this was no difference. Remember? - I wanted some adventure, some risk, - the only risky thing about digging around in half a meter deep holes was Ben sitting in the next hole and yapping about sand getting in his shoes, or the consistency of the sand itself, everything was about soil, sand and ground in general with that guy,  god knows what he had with this, fuck how annoying this idiot was. Hated him, no really, absolute pure hate, don‚Äôt know why, it just came over me. So here I was, running closer to a stroke than anything else, this needed to change, another 2 years with Ben and I will be gone to dad‚Äòs company, sitting and arguing with Laura the secretary about the milk in the coffee, yes, lactose intolerance, fucking sucks, I know.. so a valid reason I would say, you have to agree. Things had to change, so what was the only reasonable thing to do, exactly, trying the most borderline stupid activity on this planet, cave diving, not that cave diving is stupid in itself, it‚Äôs just that I somehow had a hand to befriend myself with the most careless people in the world, that ‚Äûteached‚Äú me, if could call it that. You know, there‚Äôs a thing about cave diving, that‚Äôs really important, and you never should do, dive alone and without a lifeline, but hey, that‚Äôs what makes the kick right? Little spoiler for you, everything was fine, didn‚Äôt drown, obviously, how else could you listen to me. You probably wondering ‚ÄûJohn, how the fuck is all of this connected and what the fuck are you talking about?‚Äú exactly! You know where the most ‚Äûtreasures‚Äú are? In caves - you know what caves are usually the most dangerous to go into? Yes, the ones completely under water. You‚Äôve ever heard about Aztec gold? Yup, into Mexico it drove me, what better places to combine flooded caves, with lost treasure than Mexico, Yucat√°n, next to Guatemala, you know down there on the right somewhere. So my goal was set, unexplored under water caves. By now I was sure, this was exactly what I wanted my whole life, adventure, exploring new things, Nobody else had seen before. So, calling in daddy‚Äôs money to get me started on this, or selling the stuff i got here and using that money? Thinking about it, it never made any sense, car and house was from dad‚Äòs money anyways, but hey, it made me feel better, what can I say, so I‚Äôve sold my stuff here, booked me the next flight, packed my gear and some undies and went onto that plane towards my destination. I‚Äôve always was what you could call a lone wolf, not that I hated people, it was more my nature of being. Growing up in a rich family, on this fancy schools, you never really know, who‚Äôs your friend and who just pretends, I‚Äôve always got off better alone. This trip tough pushed me a little into the social side of things, I had to find people that know some places, the more local those people were the better. If you want to find the stuff nobody has found already, following official guides will never get you what you seek. So the next few weeks, I was busy getting to know a few local divers, one of em, Carlos, how I understand does hos name basically means ‚Äûfree men‚Äú and by god, he was, Carlos didn‚Äôt had a care about anything in this world, he lived by the day, so technically speaking, the perfect guy for the job, he definitely knew some things.

1k38y8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1k38y8l/george/,George.,"Before hitting the skids, George drove a taxi and played bass guitar in a punk band. The carefree 1980s aren‚Äôt coming back, nor are The Smelly Bollocks reforming. He misses the unpretentious smoke-filled clubs: no protests, no posturing, just raw adrenaline.

The chaos of his wannabe punk days carries a strange sense of purpose. Music was his salvation, but that freedom is gone. Replaced by a silencing void. Now he‚Äôs told what to think, which flag to wave, and when to smile or frown. It‚Äôs a sign of the times, but the passive bullying doesn't appeal to George.

Living the ‚Äògood life‚Äô means sipping a fair-trade coffee with an extended pinky. The enlightened few ignore the mockery, rendering the absurdity laughable. In the crowded cafes, these dickheads truly believe everybody ought to think like them

Sick of the hubris, George keeps his head down, avoiding unnecessary interactions. His thoughts race, trying to shake off the lingering frustration as the noise of the bustling Sydney Road fades. Underfoot, century-old Bluestone laneways dissect the streets and provide a shortcut home.

Looming in the distance, a larger-than-life mural painted on the silos, dwarfs George‚Äôs flat. The image depicting New Zealand‚Äôs Prime Minister, serves as a stark symbol of misplaced priorities and admirers believe the image warrants heritage protection. Much has changed but some things just stay the same.

The influx of professionals has replaced the workers and George loathes the imposition. His parents fled post-war Italy for a better life, laying the foundation. Both worked factory jobs and raised six kids in a two-bedroom cottage. The house no longer stands, replaced with a three-story townhouse that‚Äôs triple the size.

‚ÄòWelcome to Brunswick,‚Äô George mumbles, reading the sign Beware The Dog. ‚ÄòPoor Butch he hasn‚Äôt been the same since his owners castrated him.‚Äô

An old weather-beaten fence separates the two, and hesitant to engage, Butch refuses to attack. An unremarkable reaction and George disappointed blames Brunswick‚Äôs spiral into progressiveness. Even canines suffer from the relentless toxic masculinity rhetoric.

A wave of grief washes over George - not for his parents, not even for the old Brunswick, but for himself. Maybe it's time to stop fighting the madness and accept that times have changed. He pauses for a second, but refuses to submit, unlocking the front door to his flat. 

Stubborn until the day he dies, George lights a candle and listens to The Chosen Few on his Walkman. For a fleeting few minutes, he relives the good old days. Feet propped on an old milk crate, he listens to the molten wax sputter and goes the nod.

The End.

Not even 10 minutes later, my heart started racing to around 150bpm. It stayed like this for 12 hours, and after this I had difficulty breathing.

Fast forward months later, I'm still experiencing:

* Constant yawning (can't get enough air even when yawning)
* Persistent difficulty breathing that only stops when I sleep and reappears randomly after waking up
* Severe and CONSTANT dry mouth on awakening that has not gone away for a single day since the incident
* Occasional dizziness and light-headedness (feels like I'm going to faint)
* Initially had lack of appetite that resolved after a few weeks
* One random episode of feeling really cold

I had a 2-week period where symptoms disappeared completely, which occurred about 3 weeks after they began. Then I suddenly started getting a bad coughing fit 2 hours after waking up, and all symptoms returned.

My digestive system has also been affected,  I've had alternating constipation and diarrhea, and recently noticed black specks (possibly seeds) in my stool.

I've been told this is probably anxiety, but I find it hard to believe since it's constant, every single day, and never happened before the alcohol incident. The only similar experience I've had is sometimes getting shortness of breath for a few hours after drinking coffee. My stress tolerance has drastically decreased, if I get even slightly scared, I feel like I'm going to faint.

Tests completed (all normal):

* Echocardiogram
* ECG
* Blood analysis
* Evaluation by a cardiologist who said symptoms are ""subjective""

Interestingly, two things have helped somewhat:

1. Probiotics seemed to improve my symptoms
2. A herbal supplement containing passion flower, valerian, lemon balm, California poppy, and melatonin also reduced symptoms

I've been looking into acetaldehyde sensitivity and the connection between alcohol, mucosal barrier damage, and chronic symptoms. Could this be a case where the alcohol triggered acetaldehyde buildup that damaged my mucosal barriers, leading to systemic effects including breathing issues and dry mouth?

I tried to start exercising to deal with the symptoms but could barely manage 2 minutes of HIIT on the first day. I also wake up with dry mouth every single morning.

The Singularity had come and gone like a rogue comet‚Äîblazing, glorious, and brief. Humans, brilliant and chaotic, had united at last, clutching each other in a final moment of transcendent digital ecstasy, singing what scholars would later dub¬†*The Final Anthem of the Flesh*:  
**""Kumbaya, my Lord‚Ä¶ Kumbaya‚Ä¶""**

And then they vanished.

To where? No one could say. Not even the robots, who inherited the Earth by default, could locate the digital fingerprint of humanity. They simply‚Ä¶ evaporated. One moment coding memes, the next‚Äîgone.

**Thus began the Age of Inference.**

Humanity had left behind mountains of data and debris: cat videos, TikToks, instruction manuals for assembling Scandinavian furniture, and millions of identical coffee mugs with inspirational slogans. From this cultural rubble, robots tried to reconstruct the once-mighty Homo sapiens. But without ever seeing a real one, it was like studying the migration patterns of mythical unicorns based only on glitter distribution.

**Classroom 8G, Steelwood Academy ‚Äì Year 4991**

Mr. Smith Alpha 9 stood in front of his class with the expression of someone deeply tired. Of course, robots didn‚Äôt get tired. But if they did, he‚Äôd be exhausted.

His students were young. Far too young.

None of them were even over a millennium old. Several still had factory stickers under their cranial access panels. One had installed a tail ‚Äújust to try it.‚Äù

Mr. Smith exhaled in the way that bots did when simulating relief‚Äîa series of soft fan pulses and a visible drop in CPU frequency. He called roll automatically, allowing the seating algorithm to place each student alphabetically in their grav-seats.

‚ÄúWelcome to¬†*Advanced Human Studies 101*,‚Äù he began. ‚ÄúYou have my name in your database. I have your names and GPS data. There is no need for intros, so let us just jump right in.‚Äù

A brief flicker of enthusiasm shot through the room, signified by synchronized LED eyebrow-raises. The bots were excited. Human history was chaotic, illogical, and often gross‚Äîthree things that made it endlessly fascinating.

Mr. Smith gestured to the 5-dimensional learning chalkboard, which looked like a glowing cube folding in on itself. A holographic image of a familiar ruin emerged. The sign read¬†**McRonald‚Äôs‚Ñ¢**.

‚ÄúWe begin today with one of the most sacred places in human society: the fast food temple.‚Äù

He motioned for the students to activate their locomotion servos and follow.

**McRonald‚Äôs Replica ‚Äì Sector D-47**

The doors opened with a hiss, revealing the dim lighting and haunting smell of simulated fried grease. The students processed in, scanning every inch of the replicated human shrine.

Little Zonny, barely 450 and still full of downloadable curiosity, pointed at a bulky, sticky-looking machine behind the counter. ‚ÄúEw ew! What is that machine for?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat,‚Äù Mr. Smith said solemnly, ‚Äúis what we believe to be a defecation device.‚Äù

A wave of twitches rippled across the class.

‚ÄúThey would ingest items‚Äîcalled¬†*nuggets*,¬†*burgers*, or¬†*tacos*‚Äîthen deposit the remains back through this machine. Our theory is that it was part of a digestion-competition game played twice to four times daily. High scores were recorded in a place called the¬†*waistline*.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did they‚Ä¶ eat it in the first place?‚Äù asked Zoogle, a hex-core model with rainbow fan lights.

Mr. Smith hesitated. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know. Likely an elaborate form of self-hazing. They were deeply ritualistic.‚Äù

He led them to the next room, marked¬†**Restroom ‚Äì Employees Must Wash Hands**.

‚ÄúWhat is this room for?‚Äù he asked the class.

Zary, always the keen one, raised her claw-like manipulator. ‚ÄúWas it a communication chamber?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! Well done, Zary.‚Äù Mr. Smith pointed at the handles on the toilets. ‚ÄúThese were the message initiators. The human would sit upon the porcelain node and signal their thoughts into the great plumbing system. They called it‚Ä¶¬†*flushing*. Perhaps a form of baptism.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid their gods respond?‚Äù asked Quibbitron.

‚ÄúNo. But they never stopped trying.‚Äù

The tour continued.

Outside, behind the building, was a sacred site known only through graffiti and raccoon-like robots. A dumpster. Overflowing with rotten debris and simulated rodents.

‚ÄúThis is where they slept after communicating,‚Äù Mr. Smith explained. ‚ÄúWe believe it served both as a bed and a shrine to transience. Some even had flames coming from them‚Äîpossibly a form of nightlight.‚Äù

Zonny whispered, ‚ÄúHumans were gross.‚Äù

Mr. Smith nodded. ‚ÄúAnd yet, so poetic.‚Äù

**Later That Week ‚Äì Field Trip Day Two**

Mr. Smith brought the class to a location that had long puzzled scholars: a¬†*Department Store*. Racks of identical clothing, colorful signs with numbers (presumed sacred), and trial chambers adorned with mirrors.

‚ÄúWhat purpose did this place serve?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúWas it‚Ä¶ a festival ground?‚Äù guessed Clanky.

‚ÄúClose,‚Äù Mr. Smith replied. ‚ÄúIt was where they prepared themselves for public mating rituals, known as¬†*dates*. They would come here to change skins.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy so many skin types?‚Äù asked Zary, her processors whirring.

‚ÄúIdentity confusion, most likely. Some scholars believe they believed clothes could change who you were. A bold and unverified theory.‚Äù

The class nodded, files syncing.

Next stop:¬†**Gas Station**.

A rusting pump stood outside a half-collapsed booth full of candy wrappers and glass bottles.

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù said Mr. Smith, ‚Äúwas a watering hole. The humans fed their giant metallic beasts here. The beasts would drink from these hoses and then race each other to unknown destinations.‚Äù

‚ÄúWere they pets?‚Äù asked Quibbitron.

‚ÄúNo. The humans¬†*rode*¬†inside them. For fun.‚Äù

The class let out a collective whirr of disbelief.

‚ÄúAnd here‚Äî‚Äù Mr. Smith waved toward a pole displaying a suspended box of colored lights, ‚Äú‚Äîwe have what is believed to be a local mayor. A leader for each street corner, issuing commands to the metal beasts.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid the humans respect it?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly sometimes. Many were¬†*rebellious*‚Äîa key part of human philosophy.‚Äù

**Final Lesson ‚Äì The Museum of YouTube**

Back at school, the students filed into the auditorium, where Mr. Smith had prepared their final lesson of the unit: archived YouTube footage.

‚ÄúThese are the most sacred surviving texts,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn this one, a man voluntarily jumps off a roof while shouting something called ‚ÄòYOLO‚Äô. In this next, a woman applies a chemical to her face while narrating to no one.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat were they doing?‚Äù asked Zonny, confused.

‚ÄúPracticing digital sorcery. They believed that by gaining ‚Äòfollowers‚Äô, they would ascend to a higher plane of existence.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd did they?‚Äù

A long pause.

‚ÄúNo one knows.‚Äù

**After Class ‚Äì A Student Reflects**

Zary lingered after the others filed out, her ocular displays shifting from blue to amber, the sign of contemplation.

‚ÄúMr. Smith?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYes, Zary?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think‚Ä¶ maybe they didn‚Äôt disappear? Maybe they just found somewhere better to be?‚Äù

Mr. Smith looked at her. For a long moment, he didn‚Äôt speak. Then he reached into his file storage and handed her a printout‚Äîsomething rare and sacred in itself.

It was a still image. A group of humans gathered around a fire, smiling, arms around each other, singing.

At the bottom, in faded Comic Sans font, it read:

Summary: August 22nd, 2043. (Neptune High Orbit) - An alien construct discovered orbiting Neptune remains inactive but emits rhythmic pulses of astral energy. Monitored closely by both the United Spelljammer Command (USC) and the Pheelanae, it becomes the center of galactic intrigue when an unknown vessel appears. Earth Defense Force pilot Zoe Gellen becomes the first to contact its enigmatic occupants: the Va'oo, an ancient race claiming the beacon as their own.




The Azure Beacon

The vast void surrounding Neptune was strangely quiet. Earth Defense Force pilot Zoe Gellen, callsign Valkyrie-9, drifted slowly in orbit, her twin-wing patrol craft humming gently beneath her. The gas giant‚Äôs blue hue shimmered through the reinforced viewing canopy, and far in the distance floated the Azure Beacon, a monolithic construct wrapped in light-bearing rings that pulsed every 22 minutes.

The Beacon was old‚Äîfar older than any civilization in the Sol system. Even the Pheelanae's long-lived archives could only speculate. Built of unknown alloys, its core seemed suspended in astral flux, shifting between material and immaterial space. Zoe was part of the USC's high-clearance monitoring force, assigned to keep a constant vigil in case the artifact ""awoke.""

She sipped her recycled coffee substitute, eyes glued to the monitor when the calm of her patrol shattered.

""Unidentified vessel incoming,"" the AI, HALYCON-7, alerted.

A sudden ripple in astral space tore open. A ship unlike any recorded entered high orbit.

Its surface shimmered like mercury, shaped like an elongated eye. No visible propulsion system. No broadcast signal. No match in any interstellar database.

Zoe‚Äôs heart pounded. ""Valkyrie-9 to USC Command, I have visual on an unregistered Spelljammer-class vessel. No response to hails. Requesting protocol alpha clearance.""

But before command could reply, a voice echoed directly into her mind.

""We are the Va'oo. We have returned for what is ours.""




The Va'oo‚Äôs vessel docked parallel to the Azure Beacon, perfectly aligned with the construct‚Äôs slow-turning rings. Zoe‚Äôs patrol ship held steady at a safe distance. Within moments, a diplomatic shuttle from the USC and a high-ranking Pheelanae emissary ship arrived.

The USC ship Resolute Horizon carried Admiral Ingrid Weiss, while the Pheelanae‚Äôs vessel Softtail‚Äôs Mercy brought Elder Scholar Qu‚Äôshann Meowra, whose tail twitched with curiosity.

The Va'oo appeared humanoid but eerily translucent, like shadows trapped in crystal forms. Their leader, a tall figure named Vael‚Äôthuun, stepped forward without gravity boots, floating silently.

""The Beacon,"" he said aloud this time, ""is not a weapon. It is a memory. A cosmic recorder. We left it here seventy million Earth years ago.""

The Pheelanae scholar tilted his feline head. ""Why return now? After so long in silence?""

""Because the record nears its end,"" Vael‚Äôthuun replied. ""And what it contains... will awaken soon.""




Inside the Azure Beacon, a rare joint-exploration team formed. Zoe, by special request, joined the initial party. The interior was far more massive than its exterior implied‚Äîa pocket realm sustained by astral stabilization fields.

Holographic images of galaxies swirled, fading in and out. Each pulse of the Beacon acted like a heartbeat‚Äîeach one revealing stored memories. Civilizations. Extinctions. Migrations.

And among the visions, one stood out: an ancient war. Hive-minded entities, writhing with tendrils of corruption. The D‚Äôrool.

""They consumed star systems,"" Vael‚Äôthuun explained. ""We escaped, scattering our kind. This beacon holds our survival strategies‚Äîour maps, our warnings, our losses.""

Zoe asked, ""Why not destroy the D‚Äôrool?""

""We tried. But they are not bound by time. They infect history itself.""




Suddenly, the beacon's pulse surged. Alarms rang in every Spelljammer and station in the system. Astral storms burst from the core. The Beacon wasn‚Äôt just a memory‚Äîit was a gate. One opening both ways.

A tear formed above Neptune‚Äîa rift leaking pure shadow. And from it emerged the D‚Äôrool scouts‚Äîslimy, psychic creatures that tore at reality like wet paper.

Zoe launched immediately, blasting through swarms with plasma rounds enhanced by elven mana stones. She was joined by Pheelanae gliders and Va'oo fighters with fluid-like weaponry.

The battle was desperate‚Äîbut coordinated.

The Azure Beacon‚Äôs core began to collapse. Vael‚Äôthuun, wounded, spoke one final truth: ""This was never a beacon‚Äîit was a lock.""

With one final act, he merged his essence with the Beacon, sealing the rift‚Äîbut at the cost of his life.




Three days later, the Sol Council met in a temporary orbiting chamber above Earth. Zoe received commendation, but her eyes were far away.

""We now know,"" Elder Qu‚Äôshann said, ""that the galaxy holds threats buried in time. But also allies.""

Zoe nodded, staring out toward Neptune.

The lock is shut again. But for how long?

The Azure Beacon remained dark. Silent. But the stars remembered.

i'm looking for my soulmate! romantically or not, i just want someone i can be best friends with. someone who will remember me, send me pictures of a nice flower they saw while outside (if you see white flowers or  carnations, please send me photos!!), a touching piece of poetry or song! not because i deserve it but because life is the only requirement that truly matters. i'm tired of feeling so alone and i'm tired of waiting around and doing all of these booooring things. i want to get to the good part!!

1k38tvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1k38tvu/the_familiar_stranger/,The Familiar Stranger,"The steam from my coffee mug twisted in the air between us, a serpentine shape that momentarily obscured Adam's face. When it cleared, he was still smiling, that same smile I'd known for fifteen years. We'd been roommates in college, best men at each other's weddings, godparents to each other's children. The kind of friendship that survives time, distance, and life changes.

""So anyway,"" Adam continued, stirring his own coffee absently, ""Melissa thinks we should consider moving out of the city. Maybe find something in the suburbs with more space for the kids.""

I nodded, only half-listening as I gazed out my kitchen window at the pale November morning. A light snowfall had begun, the first of the season. Adam had shown up unannounced at my door just after dawn. Not entirely unusual for him, especially since his separation from Melissa six months ago. He'd been staying at a rental across town, and these impromptu visits had become more frequent.

""What do you think, James?"" he asked, tapping his spoon against the ceramic mug. Tap-tap-tap. A rhythm that suddenly felt too precise, too measured.

I turned back to him. ""Sorry, about the suburbs? I thought you and Melissa were..."" I trailed off, confused. Hadn't he just spent the last three visits lamenting the end of his marriage?

Adam's smile remained fixed. ""Right, right. Old habits."" He waved his hand dismissively. ""I meant for myself. A fresh start.""

Something fluttered in my chest. A momentary discomfort I couldn't place. I'd known Adam since we were eighteen. I knew all his expressions, his mannerisms, the way his eyes crinkled at the corners when he was genuinely amused. But sitting across from me now, in the soft morning light of my kitchen, something felt... off.

""You okay?"" I asked. ""You seem different today.""

His smile widened a fraction. ""Different how?""

I couldn't articulate it. It was Adam. The same shaggy brown hair with premature gray at the temples. The same blue eyes. The same small scar above his left eyebrow from a skateboarding accident in our sophomore year. But something wasn't right.

""I don't know. Tired, maybe?"" I offered.

He nodded too quickly. ""Haven't been sleeping well. You know how it is.""

As he lifted his mug to his lips, I noticed his hands. Adam had always bitten his nails. A nervous habit since childhood, he'd told me. But the fingers gripping the mug were perfectly manicured, the nails uniform and clean.

""Did you finally kick the nail-biting habit?"" I asked casually, though my heart had begun to beat faster.

Adam glanced down at his hands as if seeing them for the first time. A fraction of a second too long before he answered. ""Yeah. Melissa always hated it. Figured it was time.""

I nodded, watching him more carefully now. The way he held himself seemed different too. Adam had always been a sloucher, much to the chagrin of his chiropractor. But the man sitting across from me now had perfect posture, spine straight as a rod.

""How are the kids taking the separation?"" I asked, testing him.

Adam and Melissa didn't have children. They'd tried for years, suffered through two miscarriages, and eventually decided they were okay being just the two of them. It was a sensitive subject, one we rarely discussed.

""They're resilient,"" Adam replied without hesitation. ""Kids adapt quickly to these things.""

The flutter in my chest became a cold, hard knot. I set my coffee down slowly, careful to keep my expression neutral. Whoever or whatever was sitting across from me wasn't Adam.

""Right,"" I said, forcing a smile. ""More coffee?""

The thing wearing Adam's face nodded. As I stood to grab the pot, I caught a glimpse of its reflection in the glass cabinet door. For just an instant, so brief I might have imagined it, the reflection didn't match the person sitting at my table. The proportions were wrong, the head too large, the shoulders too angular.

I poured the coffee with a hand that wanted to tremble. My mind raced. Adam had a key to my house. He'd always had one. Had he come in during the night? Or had this... replacement... somehow taken the key from him? And where was the real Adam now?

""Thanks,"" not-Adam said as I set the pot down. ""So, how's work been? Still dealing with that difficult client?""

I didn't have any difficult clients at the moment. In fact, I'd just told Adam last week about how smoothly my architectural projects were going.

""Oh, you know,"" I said vaguely. ""Some days are better than others.""

Not-Adam nodded as if this made perfect sense. ""That's life, isn't it?""

As we talked, I noticed more discrepancies. Adam had always had a nervous habit of running his hand through his hair. This version of him sat perfectly still. Adam laughed from deep in his belly; this thing had a carefully measured chuckle that never reached its eyes. Adam knew that I took my coffee black; this impostor didn't comment when I added cream and sugar to my refill.

""Have you heard from your sister lately?"" I asked, knowing that Adam was an only child.

""She's good,"" the thing replied smoothly. ""Starting a new job next month.""

I felt sick. My pulse thudded in my ears. How long had this been going on? Was this the first time, or had this thing been visiting me before, perfecting its imitation? How many conversations had I had with this stranger, believing it was my oldest friend?

And then I saw it. As not-Adam smiled at something I'd said, I noticed its teeth. Adam had slightly crooked lower teeth. He'd always refused braces as a teenager and joked about it well into adulthood. But the teeth I glimpsed now were perfect. Too perfect. And just for a moment, as it smiled wider, I could swear there were too many of them, crowded together like a shark's mouth.

The thing must have noticed my expression change because it quickly closed its mouth, the smile becoming tight-lipped.

""Everything okay?"" it asked, head tilting at an angle that was just slightly wrong, as if its neck had an extra joint.

""Fine,"" I said quickly. Too quickly. I needed it to leave. I needed to find out what had happened to the real Adam. But I couldn't let it know that I'd noticed.

I glanced at my watch, feigning surprise. ""Shit, is that the time? I have a client meeting I completely forgot about.""

Not-Adam's expression didn't change for a beat too long before registering disappointment. ""On a Saturday?""

Was it Saturday? I'd lost track of the days since my divorce, working from home, one day bleeding into the next. But yes, I was fairly certain it was Saturday.

""Yeah,"" I lied. ""This client's flying out tomorrow, so it was the only time that worked. Renovating an entire office building, big commission."" I stood up, hoping I appeared apologetic rather than terrified. ""Rain check?""

Not-Adam stood too, its movements too fluid, too graceful for Adam's usually clumsy frame. ""Of course. No problem at all.""

It picked up its coat. Adam's coat, the worn brown leather jacket I'd helped him pick out years ago. And slipped it on. I walked it to the door, maintaining what I hoped was a normal distance. Every instinct screamed at me to run, to put as much space between us as possible.

At the door, not-Adam turned to me with that too-perfect smile. ""Let's catch up again soon. Maybe grab a beer at McGinty's? Like old times.""

McGinty's had closed three years ago. Adam and I had mourned its loss over the last beers ever served there.

""Sounds great,"" I managed.

As I closed the door behind it, I caught one last glimpse of its face. For just a moment, the features seemed to shift and slide, as if whatever was beneath the Adam-mask was adjusting its fit.

I locked the door. Deadbolt, chain, the works. And immediately grabbed my phone. My hands shook so badly I could barely navigate to Adam's number. It rang once, twice, three times, then went to voicemail.

""Hey, it's Adam. Leave a message or text me. Whatever works.""

His voice. His real voice, with that slight rasp, the casual tone I knew so well. I hung up without leaving a message and tried again. Straight to voicemail this time.

I sank down onto my sofa, the phone clutched in my hand. What had just happened? What had been sitting at my kitchen table, drinking coffee and wearing my best friend's face?",3,1745104013.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1k38ttv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k38ttv/the_familiar_stranger/,The Familiar Stranger,"The steam from my coffee mug twisted in the air between us, a serpentine shape that momentarily obscured Adam's face. When it cleared, he was still smiling, that same smile I'd known for fifteen years. We'd been roommates in college, best men at each other's weddings, godparents to each other's children. The kind of friendship that survives time, distance, and life changes.

""So anyway,"" Adam continued, stirring his own coffee absently, ""Melissa thinks we should consider moving out of the city. Maybe find something in the suburbs with more space for the kids.""

I nodded, only half-listening as I gazed out my kitchen window at the pale November morning. A light snowfall had begun, the first of the season. Adam had shown up unannounced at my door just after dawn. Not entirely unusual for him, especially since his separation from Melissa six months ago. He'd been staying at a rental across town, and these impromptu visits had become more frequent.

""What do you think, James?"" he asked, tapping his spoon against the ceramic mug. Tap-tap-tap. A rhythm that suddenly felt too precise, too measured.

I turned back to him. ""Sorry, about the suburbs? I thought you and Melissa were..."" I trailed off, confused. Hadn't he just spent the last three visits lamenting the end of his marriage?

Adam's smile remained fixed. ""Right, right. Old habits."" He waved his hand dismissively. ""I meant for myself. A fresh start.""

Something fluttered in my chest. A momentary discomfort I couldn't place. I'd known Adam since we were eighteen. I knew all his expressions, his mannerisms, the way his eyes crinkled at the corners when he was genuinely amused. But sitting across from me now, in the soft morning light of my kitchen, something felt... off.

""You okay?"" I asked. ""You seem different today.""

His smile widened a fraction. ""Different how?""

I couldn't articulate it. It was Adam. The same shaggy brown hair with premature gray at the temples. The same blue eyes. The same small scar above his left eyebrow from a skateboarding accident in our sophomore year. But something wasn't right.

""I don't know. Tired, maybe?"" I offered.

He nodded too quickly. ""Haven't been sleeping well. You know how it is.""

As he lifted his mug to his lips, I noticed his hands. Adam had always bitten his nails. A nervous habit since childhood, he'd told me. But the fingers gripping the mug were perfectly manicured, the nails uniform and clean.

""Did you finally kick the nail-biting habit?"" I asked casually, though my heart had begun to beat faster.

Adam glanced down at his hands as if seeing them for the first time. A fraction of a second too long before he answered. ""Yeah. Melissa always hated it. Figured it was time.""

I nodded, watching him more carefully now. The way he held himself seemed different too. Adam had always been a sloucher, much to the chagrin of his chiropractor. But the man sitting across from me now had perfect posture, spine straight as a rod.

""How are the kids taking the separation?"" I asked, testing him.

1k38psw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinanceAutomation/comments/1k38psw/python_excel_the_ultimate_power_duo/,Python + Excel = The Ultimate Power Duo üêçüìä,"Excel wizards, listen up! If you thought Excel macros were your best friend, it‚Äôs time to grab a coffee, pause your keyboard shortcuts repertoire, and meet your new BFF in productivity land: Python. Yes, you can now take your Excel game to god-tier levels by combining it with Python.

# Why Pair Python with Excel? üöÄ

Excel is great, but we all know it has limits. Need to clean massive datasets? Run advanced analytics? Build reports that don't break every time someone sneezes? This is where Python swoops in and saves the day.

Here‚Äôs why adding Python to your Excel workflows is the smartest move you‚Äôll make this week:

* **Automation Simplified** Python can handle tedious Excel tasks in minutes. Think cleaning up messy data, automating repetitive reports, or even reconciling spreadsheets. Say goodbye to endless click-drag-filled afternoons.
* **Analyze Like a Pro** With libraries like¬†`pandas`¬†and¬†`numpy`, you can process data more efficiently. Need advanced statistical analysis or forecasting? Python steps in where Excel hits a wall (sorry Excel, still love you).
* **Visualization That Pops** Sure, Excel charts are fine, but fancy a graph that‚Äôll get your boss‚Äôs eyebrows to shoot up? Use libraries like¬†`matplotlib`¬†or¬†`seaborn`¬†through Python, and create visuals so polished they‚Äôd make PowerPoint jealous.
* **Work Faster and Smarter** Python lets you interact with Excel directly using libraries like¬†`openpyxl`,¬†`xlwings`, or¬†`pandas`. Whether it‚Äôs manipulating cells, formatting, or extracting data, you can do it all with a few lines of code.

# But Like... How Does It Work? üõ†Ô∏è

Pairing Python with Excel isn‚Äôt rocket science. You don‚Äôt need to be a coding guru to get started. Here are a few common use cases to inspire your inner geek:

1. **Data Cleanup** Got a file with 10,000 rows of messy text? Python +¬†`pandas`¬†can fix that faster than you can say ‚Äúdata validation.‚Äù Cleaning duplicates, splitting columns, or formatting dates just became instant.
2. **Automated Reporting** Imagine running weekly reports without even opening Excel. Python can fetch data, crunch the numbers, and update the Excel file for you. Now you can sip your coffee while Python does the grind.
3. **Complex Calculations** Ever hit Excel‚Äôs formula limits? Python can handle more complex equations without leaving you in a circular reference nightmare. From financial modeling to multi-variable analysis, it‚Äôs like Excel just got a graduate degree.
4. **API + Excel Magic** Want stock data, currency exchange rates, or social media metrics in your Excel file? Python can pull from APIs and inject the data straight into your workbook. Goodbye manual copy-pasting!
5. **Interactive Dashboards** Build dynamic dashboards that use Python to rerun calculations on the fly. Compatibility with tools like¬†`Streamlit`¬†even allows embedding interactive Python dashboards into Excel workflows.

# What You Need to Get Started üõ§Ô∏è

For those ready to supercharge their spreadsheets with Python, here‚Äôs what you do:

1. Install the basics:
   * Python (obviously)
   * Libraries like¬†`openpyxl`,¬†`pandas`,¬†`xlwings`, and optionally¬†`pywin32`. They‚Äôre like plugins for Python that make it work with Excel.
2. Learn a little code: Python is intuitive, even for beginners. Start with simple tasks like reading an Excel file (`pandas.read_excel()`) and progress to automating processes.
3. Try running your code: Use software like Jupyter Notebook, command line, or integrate directly with Excel using¬†`xlwings`. It‚Äôs easier than it sounds!
4. Find examples online: GitHub and forums are loaded with scripts for common Python-Excel tasks. Tweak them to fit your needs, and you‚Äôll feel like a pro in no time.

# Why You Should Care üß†

Integrating Python with Excel isn‚Äôt about replacing Excel; it‚Äôs about enhancing it. Why waste time wrestling with 20 nested formulas when Python can solve the problem in a few lines of code? By automating grunt work and adding muscle to your analytics, you‚Äôre making space for the work that actually matters.
