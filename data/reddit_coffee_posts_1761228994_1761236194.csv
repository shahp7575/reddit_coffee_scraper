1oe7jvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1oe7jvu/best_carryon_travel_backpack_for_women_with/,Best Carry-on Travel Backpack For Women With Laptop Sleeve,"I'll never forget standing in the middle of Haneda Airport at 6 AM, my laptop precariously balanced on top of my overstuffed tote bag, desperately trying to fish out my passport while my ""personal item"" backpack slowly slid off my shoulder. Again. That's when I realized: I needed a real travel backpack. Not just any backpack, but one designed for someone who carries a 15-inch MacBook, wants to look remotely professional, and doesn't have the shoulder width of a linebacker.

After three years of testing backpacks through airports in Tokyo, cramming them under airplane seats, and yes—accidentally dropping my laptop once (it survived, thank god)—I've learned what actually works for women who travel with technology. Spoiler: most ""unisex"" backpacks are designed for men, which is why that sternum strap always seems to dig into exactly the wrong place.

Here's what I've discovered actually matters when you're trying to find a carry-on travel backpack with a laptop sleeve that won't make you hate every minute of your trip.

>🧠 **Still deciding?** You don’t need to reread the whole post. I’ve summarized all key specs, prices, and models inside a [**Backpack Comparison Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16n-yjeyMhoZ3Jeut6NOWVY29Uz9RLUJROgv22E8POrI/).  
Think of it as your **cheat sheet** to finding the right backpack — free, easy to use, and updated regularly.

# What Makes a Good Women's Laptop Travel Backpack?

Before we dive into specific bags, let's talk about what actually matters. Because honestly? The internet is full of listicles that recommend the same five backpacks without explaining why most of them will probably drive you crazy if you're under 5'8"" or have, you know, breasts.

**The laptop compartment is everything.** It needs to be padded, accessible without unpacking everything, and—this is crucial—positioned against your back, not flopping around on the outside where it can bend when you stuff the bag under the seat. I learned this the hard way with a previous backpack that nearly destroyed my laptop on a bumpy train ride through the Alps.

**Trolley sleeves are non-negotiable** if you travel with a rolling suitcase. Trust me on this. That little pass-through strap on the back that slides over your suitcase handle will save your shoulders and your sanity when you're sprinting through O'Hare trying to make a connection.

**Women-specific fit features matter more than you think.** Curved shoulder straps that account for breasts, adjustable sternum straps that don't crush your chest, narrower shoulder strap spacing, and hip belts designed for wider hips—these aren't marketing gimmicks. After

a full day of wearing a backpack designed for someone with broader shoulders than me, I've had nerve pain down my arms. Not fun.

**TSA-friendly is mandatory.** The standard carry-on size is 22"" x 14"" x 9"", and going over that means gate-checking your bag (and losing access to your laptop mid-flight). Most of these backpacks stay comfortably within those limits.

Now, let's get to the actual backpacks that won't betray you at the airport.

# 1. Osprey Fairview 40 — Best Overall for Most Women

**Price:** \~$185  
**Laptop fits:** Up to 16""  
**Dimensions:** 21.3 x 13.8 x 9 inches  
**Weight:** 3.2 lbs

If I could only recommend one backpack to every woman reading this, it would be the Osprey Fairview 40. Not because it's perfect (spoiler: no backpack is), but because it's specifically designed for women's torsos and actually delivers on comfort in a way most backpacks simply don't.

The Fairview's suspension system is legitimately impressive. It has load lifter straps, a padded hip belt, and adjustable torso length—features you usually only find on serious hiking backpacks. This means even when I'm carrying my laptop, a change of clothes, toiletries, and a book (okay, fine, three books), the weight doesn't all crush down on my shoulders. The hip belt transfers the load, and suddenly that 20-pound bag feels manageable instead of miserable.

The 2023 update fixed the biggest complaint people had: the laptop compartment is now internal and padded against your back instead of on the outside where it could bend. Smart move, Osprey. The laptop sleeve fits up to a 16-inch device, and there's a separate tablet pocket too.

Here's what I love: the clamshell opening means you can pack it like a suitcase, which makes airport security a breeze. There's a large front pocket for quick-access items, and the whole thing compresses down when you're not traveling with a full load.

**The honest downside**: Organization inside the main compartment is pretty minimal. You're basically looking at one big open space, which means packing cubes are essential unless you enjoy digging through everything to find your socks. Also, the external mesh pocket (now a single large one instead of two smaller ones) is basically useless if your bag is fully packed—nothing fits in there.

The other thing: it's not going to win any style awards. It looks like... a backpack. A functional, slightly outdoorsy backpack. If you're hoping to blend in at a business meeting, this isn't it. But if you're prioritizing comfort and durability for actual travel? This is your pack.

**Who this is for:** Women who want maximum comfort for longer trips (think a week or more), don't mind the outdoor aesthetic, and value function over fashion. Especially great if you're between 5'2"" and 5'10"" with a typical women's torso length.

**Real talk from someone 5'4"":** I wore this fully packed through two weeks in New Zealand, and my back didn't hate me. That's saying something.

# 2. Cotopaxi Allpa 35L — Most Durable & Weatherproof

**Price:** \~$225  
**Laptop fits:** Up to 16""  
**Dimensions:** 22 x 12 x 10 inches  
**Weight:** 3 lbs

The Cotopaxi Allpa is the backpack equivalent of that friend who's always prepared for anything. Rain? No problem. Overstuffed to the brim? It can take it. Need to use it for five years straight? It'll still look good.

The build quality is genuinely outstanding. TPU-coated 1000D polyester isn't just marketing speak—it's legitimately tough stuff. I watched someone at the airport literally drag this bag across concrete, and it didn't even scratch. The YKK zippers are lockable (hello, anti-theft peace of mind), and the whole thing feels bombproof.

The 2024 redesign added what everyone was begging for: an external water bottle pocket and an improved trolley sleeve. Previous versions made you choose between accessing your water bottle and actually being able to use your bag. Not ideal when you're dehydrated at 30,000 feet.

Internal organization is where this bag shines. There are zippered mesh pockets everywhere, and the clamshell opening means you can see and access everything at once. The laptop compartment is well-padded and fits up to a 16-inch device, plus there's room for a tablet.

**The catches:** At $225, this is pricier than some competitors that offer similar capacity. The shoulder straps, while comfortable, lack the fancy suspension system of bags like the Osprey—so if you're carrying heavy loads for extended periods, your shoulders will feel it more. And some people find the organization almost *too* fussy, especially for shorter trips where you don't need 17 different pockets.

Also, the external aesthetic is pretty minimal—basically just a black rectangle. Great if you like sleek and understated, less exciting if you want something with personality.

**Who this is for:** Digital nomads, frequent travelers who are hard on gear, anyone traveling to rainy destinations, and people who love having a specific pocket for literally everything. Also perfect if you value durability enough to invest more upfront.

**The sustainability angle:** Cotopaxi is a certified B-Corp focused on ethical manufacturing. If that matters to you (it does to me), this bag aligns with those values.

# 3. Away Everywhere Backpack — Most Stylish & Sleek

**Price:** \~$225  
**Laptop fits:** Up to 15""  
**Dimensions:** 18.5 x 12 x 7 inches  
**Weight:** 2.2 lbs

Okay, real talk: if someone told me five years ago that I'd be excited about a backpack from a luggage company, I would've laughed. But Away proved me wrong.

The Everywhere Backpack is genuinely beautiful. The water-resistant nylon has this lovely matte finish, it comes in colors beyond black (hello, navy and green!), and it looks polished enough that I've carried it into client meetings without feeling self-conscious. This is the bag for women who want their travel gear to look like it belongs with their wardrobe, not their hiking gear collection.

Inside, there are thoughtful touches everywhere. A dedicated laptop sleeve (fits up to 15""), a hidden passport pocket on the side, multiple organizational compartments, and—my favorite detail—a luggage sleeve that slides over your suitcase handle. The padded straps are comfortable even during long commutes, and the slim profile means it doesn't scream ""TOURIST"" quite as loudly as bulkier options.

**The reality check:** This backpack is smaller than the others on this list. At 18.5 x 12 x 7 inches with about 21 liters of capacity, it's better suited as a personal item or for short trips (2-3 days max) rather than as your primary carry-on for a week-long trip. Also, there's no water bottle pocket on the outside, which is genuinely annoying when you're trying to stay hydrated on a flight.

The laptop compartment only accommodates up to 15-inch devices, so if you've got a 16-inch MacBook Pro, you'll need to size up to Away's larger model or look elsewhere.

**Who this is for:** Professional women who prioritize style, short-trip travelers, digital nomads who work from cafes and want something that looks good in professional settings, and anyone building a capsule wardrobe who wants their bag to coordinate. Also perfect as a second bag that complements a larger checked suitcase.

**From my experience:** I used this for a long weekend in Lisbon, and it was perfect. I used it for two weeks in Southeast Asia... less perfect. Know your trip type before committing.

# 4. Calpak Kaya Laptop Backpack — Best for Style-Conscious Travelers on a Budget

**Price:** \~$88  
**Laptop fits:** Up to 15""  
**Dimensions:** 17 x 12 x 6 inches  
**Weight:** 2.8 lbs

Can we talk about how refreshing it is to find a genuinely stylish backpack that doesn't cost $200+? The Calpak Kaya manages to look expensive while being surprisingly affordable, which is basically magic.

The vegan leather exterior with braided detailing gives this bag a structured, put-together look that works equally well for a work commute or a weekend trip. It comes in gorgeous colors—I'm talking lavender, spearmint, and neutrals—so you can actually match it to your aesthetic instead of defaulting to black because nothing else exists.

Functionally, it delivers the basics well. There's a padded laptop sleeve for devices up to 15 inches, a spacious main compartment that can fit a few days' worth of clothes and toiletries, and multiple interior and exterior pockets for organization. The back slip pocket doubles as a trolley sleeve, which is clutch when you're navigating airports with a rolling suitcase.

**What you need to know:** This is a smaller backpack best suited for 2-3 day trips or as a work/personal item bag rather than your main carry-on. The vegan leather, while attractive, won't be as durable as the technical materials on pricier bags. After about six months of regular use, mine is showing some wear on the corners. Also, it's structured and boxy, which looks great but means less flexibility if you need to cram it into tight spaces.

The shoulder straps have decent padding but nothing like the suspension systems on packs designed for heavier loads. Fine for a laptop and essentials, less comfortable if you're trying to pack for a full week.

**Who this is for:** Budget-conscious travelers who still care about aesthetics, commuters who need something that works for both work and weekends, and anyone who's sick of every ""affordable"" option looking cheap or athletic. Perfect for people who want to look polished without the premium price tag.

**Style note:** The quilted texture definitely reads a bit ""coastal grandmother,"" but honestly? I'm here for it. Sometimes you want your backpack to be cute, and that's okay.

# 5. AmazonBasics Carry-On Travel Backpack — Best Budget Option Under $50

**Price:** \~$45  
**Laptop fits:** Up to 17""  
**Dimensions:** 22 x 14 x 9 inches (expandable)  
**Weight:** 2.9 lbs

Look, I get it. Sometimes you need a functional carry-on backpack with a laptop sleeve and you absolutely do not have $200 to spend. Been there. The AmazonBasics Carry-On Travel Backpack is proof that you don't need to drain your savings to travel comfortably.

For under $50, this bag delivers surprisingly well. The padded laptop compartment accommodates up to 17-inch devices and is elevated off the bottom of the bag (crucial if you set your bag down in, say, a puddle). The main compartment has a clamshell opening, compression straps to keep everything tight, and even expands for extra packing space when you inevitably buy too many souvenirs.

The shoulder straps are well-cushioned with mesh backing for breathability, and there's a sternum strap for extra stability. Multiple exterior pockets give you quick access to passports, boarding passes, and chargers. For the price, the build quality is solid—I've had mine for two years of regular use, and it's holding up better than expected.

**The compromises:** The materials aren't as premium as higher-end bags—think sturdy but not indestructible. The zippers work fine but don't have the smooth glide of YKK zippers. Organization inside is minimal (basically just one mesh pocket in the lid), so you'll definitely want packing cubes. The back panel isn't as structured, so when it's fully packed, it can bulge awkwardly.

Also, let's be honest about aesthetics: this looks like a basic travel backpack. It's perfectly functional but won't win any design awards. If you care about style, this isn't going to make you excited to travel.

**Who this is for:** Budget travelers, college students, anyone buying their first travel backpack and not ready to invest heavily, people who travel infrequently and need something that works without breaking the bank. Also great as a backup bag or for lending to friends who are borrowing your gear.

**Real talk:** I used this for a month backpacking through Vietnam when I was between ""real"" backpacks, and it genuinely held up. It's not glamorous, but it gets the job done.

# 6. Lo & Sons Catalina Deluxe — Best Premium Convertible Option

**Price:** \~$278  
**Laptop fits:** Up to 13""  
**Dimensions:** 16.5 x 11.5 x 6.75 inches  
**Weight:** 3.2 lbs

The Lo & Sons Catalina Deluxe is what happens when someone actually listens to what women want in a travel bag. You can wear it as a backpack when you're navigating public transit, carry it as a tote when you arrive at your hotel, or slide it over your suitcase handle using the trolley sleeve. It's the Swiss Army knife of bags.

The materials are beautiful—this mix of water-resistant nylon and leather details that somehow manages to look both practical and elevated. There are thoughtful pockets everywhere: a padded laptop compartment, a trolley sleeve, external and internal organization, water bottle slots, shoe compartments, passport pockets, and even a key leash. Basically, if you've ever thought ""I wish my bag had a place for THIS,"" Lo & Sons probably included it.

The build quality justifies the price. Water-resistant fabric, sturdy metal feet on the bottom so it doesn't get dirty when you set it down, premium zippers, and attention to detail that you just don't see in cheaper bags.

**The reality:** At $278, this is an investment. And for that price, you're getting... 13-inch laptop capacity. If you have a larger device, you'll need to look at their bigger models, which gets even pricier. The 16.5 x 11.5 x 6.75-inch dimensions make this better suited as a personal item or short-trip bag rather than your main carry-on for longer journeys.

Some reviewers mention the convertible straps can be a bit finicky to adjust between backpack and tote mode—not difficult, but not quite as seamless as you'd hope. And while the leather detailing is gorgeous, it does add weight.

**Who this is for:** Professional women who want one bag that works for business trips and weekend getaways, people who love having organizational options, anyone who values the ability to switch between carrying styles. Perfect if you're willing to invest in a ""forever bag"" that'll last for years.

**Style perspective:** This is hands-down the most elegant option on this list. If you want to look polished stepping off a plane, this is it.

# 7. North Face Women's Jester — Best for Commuters & Everyday Use

**Price:** \~$75  
**Laptop fits:** Up to 15""  
**Dimensions:** 18 x 13 x 10 inches  
**Weight:** 1.8 lbs

Sometimes you don't need a fancy travel-specific backpack—you just need something reliable that works for your daily commute and occasional weekend trips. The North Face Women's Jester is that bag.

This is North Face's most popular women's backpack, and for good reason. It's comfortable (padded mesh back panel and shoulder straps), has a laptop sleeve that fits up to 15-inch devices, includes both a main compartment and a front organizational pocket, and comes in approximately one million colors. I mean, not literally, but there are a lot of options beyond boring black.

The women-specific fit includes shoulder straps that are spaced closer together and contoured for smaller frames. The sternum strap is positioned appropriately for female anatomy, which matters way more than it sounds like it should. After a full day of wearing this to and from work, I don't have that weird shoulder ache that comes from straps positioned too wide.

At 26 liters, it's spacious enough for a day's worth of stuff plus your laptop, or a long weekend if you pack light. The external bungee cord system is perfect for securing a jacket or yoga mat, and there are side water bottle pockets that actually hold a standard water bottle (looking at you, bags with ""water bottle pockets"" that can't fit anything larger than a toddler's sippy cup).

**The catches:** This isn't designed for serious travel. There's no trolley sleeve, the main compartment doesn't have a clamshell opening, and the padding isn't substantial enough for carrying heavy loads all day. It's water-resistant, not waterproof, so if you get caught in a downpour, your laptop might get damp.

Also, while it *can* fit under an airplane seat, it doesn't pack as efficiently as bags specifically designed for travel. The rounded shape means wasted space compared to more structured travel packs.

**Who this is for:** Students, commuters who need a daily bag that occasionally doubles for short trips, budget-conscious buyers who want a reliable brand name, anyone who prioritizes comfort for lighter loads over maximum packing capacity.

**My verdict:** This is a fantastic everyday backpack that can handle occasional travel. Just don't expect it to replace a dedicated travel backpack if you're doing serious trips.

# 8. Lululemon Wunderlust Backpack — Best for Active Travelers

**Price:** \~$178  
**Laptop fits:** Up to 15""  
**Dimensions:** 19 x 13 x 8 inches (approximately 25L)  
**Weight:** 2.1 lbs

I'll admit—I was skeptical about a Lululemon backpack. Like, sure, their leggings are great, but a travel backpack? Turns out, they actually know what they're doing.

The Wunderlust is genuinely versatile in a way few bags manage. There's a padded laptop sleeve, multiple drawstring side compartments (with smaller zippered pockets inside those), quick-access pockets, and an adjustable strap that can secure a jacket or yoga mat. The materials are weather-resistant without being bulky, and the whole thing somehow manages to look athletic without screaming ""I'M GOING TO THE GYM.""

What surprised me most is how well it works for both active and non-active travel. I've used it for work commutes, weekend yoga retreats, and a two-week trip through Southeast Asia where half my activities were hiking-related and half were city exploration. The organization kept everything accessible, and the comfortable straps meant I wasn't dying by day three.

The drawstring side pockets are large enough for actual water bottles (revolutionary!), and there's enough space in the main compartment for packing cubes, a toiletry bag, and a few changes of clothes for short trips.

**The downsides:** At 25 liters, this is on the smaller end for a travel backpack. It works great for 3-5 day trips or as a personal item paired with a larger checked bag, but it won't replace your main luggage for longer journeys. There's no trolley sleeve, which is genuinely annoying if you travel with a rolling suitcase.

Also—and this is personal preference—the Lululemon aesthetic is pretty distinctive. If you don't vibe with athleisure style, this might feel too ""on-brand"" for your taste.

**Who this is for:** Women who mix active and casual travel, yoga retreat-goers, digital nomads who work from cafes but also hit the gym, anyone who wants one bag for multiple purposes, and fans of Lululemon's overall aesthetic. Perfect if you refuse to choose between looking sporty and being functional.

**Unexpected bonus:** The materials are seriously easy to clean. I spilled coffee on mine (of course), and it wiped right off. Small victories.

# How to Actually Choose the Right Backpack for YOU

Here's the thing nobody tells you: there's no universally ""best"" backpack. I know, I know—that's frustrating when you just want someone to tell you what to buy. But after testing dozens of bags, I've learned that the right backpack depends entirely on your specific situation.

**Start with your trip type:**

* **Short trips (2-4 days):** You can get away with smaller, stylish options like the Away Everywhere or Calpak Kaya
* **Week-long trips:** You need something like the Osprey Fairview 40 or Cotopaxi Allpa 35L with serious capacity
* **Business travel:** Prioritize professional aesthetics (Lo & Sons Catalina, Away Everywhere)
* **Adventure travel:** Go for durability and weather resistance (Cotopaxi Allpa, Osprey Fairview)

**Consider your body type:** This matters SO much more than most reviews admit. If you're petite (under 5'4""), look for bags with adjustable torso lengths and narrower shoulder strap spacing. If you're taller or have broader shoulders, you might actually do fine with unisex bags. And if you're full-busted, pay close attention to sternum strap placement—some bags will make you want to throw them out a window.

**Think about your laptop size:** A 13-inch MacBook Air fits in everything. A 16-inch MacBook Pro? That eliminates about half your options. Measure your laptop before you shop.

**Budget honestly:** Yes, quality bags cost more. But if you travel even twice a year, spending $150-250 on something that'll last five years is worth it compared to replacing a $40 bag every year. That said, if you travel rarely, the AmazonBasics option is perfectly fine.

**Don't forget the trolley sleeve:** Seriously. If you ever travel with a rolling suitcase, that little pass-through strap on the back will change your life. Once you have it, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

# The Features That Actually Matter (And the Ones That Don't)

**Must-haves:**

* Padded laptop compartment positioned against your back
* TSA carry-on compliant dimensions
* Water resistance (at minimum)
* Compression straps to keep packed items secure
* Multiple organizational pockets

**Nice-to-haves:**

* Trolley sleeve (unless you never use rolling luggage)
* USB charging port (requires your own power bank)
* Lockable zippers for anti-theft
* Shoe compartment (if you're particular about keeping shoes separate)

**Usually unnecessary:**

* Weight scales built into straps
* Excessive ""tech pockets"" that are too small for modern devices
* Removable daypacks that add bulk without much benefit
* More than two water bottle pockets

# My Final, Honest Recommendations

If you made it this far, congratulations—you now know more about women's laptop travel backpacks than most people on the planet. Here's what I'd actually recommend to different types of travelers:

**For most women:** Get the Osprey Fairview 40. Yes, it's not the most stylish. But it's comfortable, durable, and works for the widest range of body types and trip lengths.

**If you prioritize style:** The Away Everywhere or Lo & Sons Catalina will make you feel polished while still being functional.

**On a tight budget:** The AmazonBasics backpack at $45 genuinely works. It won't make you Instagram-famous, but your shoulders and wallet will thank you.

**For serious durability:** The Cotopaxi Allpa 35L will survive anything you throw at it and look good doing it.

**For everyday use that occasionally travels:** The North Face Women's Jester is reliable, comfortable, and affordable.

The truth is, you'll probably go through a few backpacks in your lifetime as a traveler. Your needs change, airlines update their policies, and what worked for weekend trips stops working when you start taking longer journeys. That's okay. The backpack that gets you through the next chapter of your travels is out there—hopefully one of these eight will be exactly what you need.

Now stop reading reviews and go book that trip. Your perfect backpack is waiting.

I’m trying to dial in resting times before freezing most of my coffees (I’ll only keep one bag out each week).

Right now I’m thinking Sey = 4 weeks, DAK = 3 weeks, and everything else ~3–4 weeks.

But I’m wondering if it makes more sense to rest by process type instead — something like:

	•	Washed → 2–3 weeks
	•	Honey / Co-Ferment → 3 weeks
	•	Natural → 3–4 weeks
	•	Anaerobic / Advanced → 4+ weeks

Here’s what I’m working with:

DAK (10/03)
	•	Strawberry Jelly — Anaerobic Natural
	•	Cream Donut — Yeast-Inoculated Natural
	•	Big Apple — Honey Co-Ferment Green Apple
	•	Peachy Daze — Washed
	•	Raspberry Pop — Washed

Perc (10/05)
	•	Pepe Jijon — Sidra | Wave Washed

Sey (9/29)
	•	Miguel Dota — Washed
	•	Elora Lot #151 — Fermented Honey
	•	Elora Lot #25 — Honey
	•	Yaye Arbegona — Washed

DAK (10/15)
	•	Orange Flirt — Natural
	•	Cherry Slide — Natural
	•	Berry Blues — Anaerobic Natural
	•	Strawberry Kiss — Natural

	•	Colombia Santa Monica Strawberry Co-Ferment
	•	Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Idido Yismashewa — Anaerobic Natural
	•	Kenya Nyeri Hill Estate AA — Washed
	•	Colombia Santa Monica Lychee Co-Ferment — Washed

B&W (10/14)
	•	Jairo Arcila “Halloween Candy” — Co-Ferment
	•	Esteban Zamora “Cinnamon” — Anaerobic
	•	Edinson Argote — Advanced Natural

Hydrangea (10/19)
	•	Salma Bermudez Gesha — Special Fermentation Washed
	•	Letty Bermudez Gesha — Double Fermentation Thermal Shock
	•	Hacienda El Obraje Gesha — Anaerobic Washed



So — what do you all think? Better to rest by roaster (since styles are consistent) or by process type (since degassing differs)?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I am 53M, 5'9, 77 kg, muscular, physically active (4-5 times strength training) and relatively fit and healthy (except for the love handles and slight tummy)

I stumbled upon a YouTube video about intermittent fasting (Ben Azadi) and instantly got inspired and wanted to try. I always wanted to shed few kilos of weight, lose love handles and look more lean and muscular. I checked my fitness parameters on a newly ordered weight scale and the results are...not good. While my frame does not look overweight by any standards and I always received compliments about my 'fit look', the scale told me a whole different story - it declared that I am 'overweight' and I need to shed at least 9 kg of fat, improve by BMI (25.9), and lose an overall 12 kg of weight. Now, I want to take the challenge and see how far I can go (realistic target weight loss of 9-10 kg and improved fitness scores like BMI, BMR, fat mass/ratio, etc.

Now that I know what I want to do and target is set, I started intermittent fasting around 4 weeks ago. I started with 12:12 (12 hour fasting, 12 hour eating) in the first week, 14:10 in the second and 16:8 in the third week. I complemented it with a one day 24 hour fasting at the end of 3rd week. This appears to be the sweet spot for me (16 hour fasting 8 hour eating window, and 24 hour fasting once a week). Honestly, it's not difficult as I thought it would be. More than the weight loss (3.5 kilos lost in nearly 4 weeks), I feel much better overall. I feel lighter, no cravings, feel more active and focused. Stomach feels great, no bloating feeling (which was the case before), better digestion, slightly improved sleep, overall it's looking good. BTW, I also cut down sugar completely and the beautiful black coffee is my best friend now.

What next:

* In addition to the 4-5 days of 1 hour strength training in a week, I plan to improve my steps count...like consciously do a 10-15 minute walk after any meal. Currently doing 7K steps per day and will increase it to 10K from today.
* I am easily doing 16:8 fasting and can do 17:7 without much trouble. I plan to do this within a week
* I drink a small quantity of alcohol with friends, may be once in a month - like 180 ml. Small pleasures of life with friends and not looking to change it

Questions:

* As the eating window is reduced to 7-8 hours with limited food, how does the body get all the necessary nutrition it needs? while I have not experienced any side effects, this is bugging me a little. I am trying to add protein and good carbs and stay healthy as much as possible, is this enough for the body? Should I take multi vitamin supplements?
* I see that the needle moving in the right direction for all the health parameters except one - Visceral fat. Absolutely no change whatsoever from the day I started. I hope to see this come down soon and this appears to the most stubborn area. May be it needs 48 hour fasting once in a while to kickstart autophagy. Any other ideas?
* I also need improved sleep, it's definitely better than before but I would love a 6-7 hour deep sleep that am still waiting for

This is my journey so far...look forward to hear your experiences and thoughts, what other things I can incorporate to make it more exciting and rewarding (reduction in BMI, visceral fat, body fat %)",2,1761235896.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

I (30M) was close like a best friend with my sister, I helped her throughout everything, including her career. We built a sport business together, it ran well, and an investor (let's say: Andy) came scale up the business.

Andy is a businessman, so do I, my sister is a sport coach, at first it was okay, but turned up dispute, because Andy has different opinions with me as the leader of the company. Andy accused me about corruption, turned up I came clean after audit, plus mismanagement that couldn't be proven. Andy with his gaslighting style, said he would exit the company, because he doesn't want to ""ruin"" the family, yet my sister pushed me to get out from the company. And she told Andy that she'd KICKED me from the company (I knew from several sources including my mom).

Ever since, we hadn't been talking on each other, and arrived the day that I was going to marry my fiancée. Out of the blue, my sister asked my fiancée to have a coffee together, turned out she was badmouthing me, slander statements, to my fiancée. (I knew from my fiancée herself, luckily I have a open conversation with her, if not, we would cancelled the marriage).

My support system was my wife, dad, mom and my other sister. I shared my pain in details and they calmed me down, asking me always to give forgiveness. After I forgave, and I want to confront my sister and reconcile, they said don't do it.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

I (30M) was close like a best friend with my sister, I helped her throughout everything, including her career. We built a sport business together, it ran well, and an investor (let's say: Andy) came scale up the business.

Andy is a businessman, so do I, my sister is a sport coach, at first it was okay, but turned up dispute, because Andy has different opinions with me as the leader of the company. Andy accused me about corruption, turned up I came clean after audit, plus mismanagement that couldn't be proven. Andy with his gaslighting style, said he would exit the company, because he doesn't want to ""ruin"" the family, yet my sister pushed me to get out from the company. And she told Andy that she'd KICKED me from the company (I knew from several sources including my mom).

Ever since, we hadn't been talking on each other, and arrived the day that I was going to marry my fiancée. Out of the blue, my sister asked my fiancée to have a coffee together, turned out she was badmouthing me, slander statements, to my fiancée. (I knew from my fiancée herself, luckily I have a open conversation with her, if not, we would cancelled the marriage).

My support system was my wife, dad, mom and my other sister. I shared my pain in details and they calmed me down, asking me always to give forgiveness. After I forgave, and I want to confront my sister and reconcile, they said don't do it.

The next morning we got up and went about our usual routine. He was angry bc I didn't resolve the issue before going to bed. (He has a strong belief that will cause a demonic attack on our household and so he sees me as a threat when I'm angry at him bc I'm sinning).Then my 12yr old daughter was sad bc My husband had laughed at her when she came into the room moments earlier saying she felt like she wasn't sick anymore, and she had a really scratchy voice.

 So she left the room sadly and I followed her to her room to talk to her about it. She and I were sitting on the floor in her room and she was telling me how what my husband did hurt her feelings. After a moment, my husband burst in and said to her, "" your mother is imbalanced and should not be listened to or trusted right now. ""

 Then he turned to me and started yelling about how I need to deal with my problems and I don't even know what else bc I was stuck in what he said to my daughter. She was pissed, got up and started walking toward the door. He blocked the door and told her to go sit down but she interrupted him saying she needs to go to the bathroom ( she later told me that she didn't need to but she knew he would move out of her way for that and she just went in the bathroom and cried) so he moved aside then continued to yell at me. He was demanding to know when I was leaving for my appointment so that he knew what he needed to deal with for the morning so I said "" I'm leaving right now"" even though it was way earlier than I needed to leave, I just wanted to get out of the house. It escalated as I gathered my things to leave. 

I am on my period and extra emotional. I've been talking to him about my struggles with perimenopause and all the mood swings, etc.
I was just so angry that he spoke about me like that .. at all. But to say that to my daughter was like rage inducing. I thought I might throw my coffee cup at him. I didn't. I didn't yell until right as I was walking out the door, which was only a couple min later. I told him I didn't care if he had to miss meetings bc of me and that if he's going to speak to me like that I just didn't care that he's inconvenienced. And then I left and slammed the door behind me. All my kids were around to hear and see everything. 

When I talked to him about it later, he was completely unapologetic and justified himself and everything he did. He refused to apologize to our daughter or me bc we're just two crazy women with "" hormonal problems"". I think this might be a breaking point for me because it just seems so wrong. But I'm asking for opinions bc after all I'm just a crazy hormonal person so what do I know? 

when I spoke to him later that day about blocking the door he says that he was going to just finish his sentence and then let her go by and he wanted her to hear what he was saying to me. He says he didn't do anything wrong. So he just kept saying "" I didn't block the door but if I wanted my child to stay in their room then that's my perogative and there's nothing wrong with that"". So he's trying to ignore the actual situation and talk about a hypothetical "" your grounded, go to your room"" type of scenario which isn't what was happening.... Right? 

My 5 sons are watching all this. Seeing how he uses religion and his authority to justify how he's treating us all in ways that we know feel down aren't right. 

TL, DR: my husband was angry at me for going to bed angry, told my 12 yr old that I'm imbalanced and shouldn't be trusted, blocked the door when she tried to leave, then insisted he did nothing wrong biblically. That I'm wrong and need to accept his behavior. ",1,1761235430.0,Christianmarriage,0,1.0,False

1oe78mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1oe78mj/best_vpn_for_nepal/,Best VPN for Nepal,"When Nepal's government blocked 26 social media platforms in September 2025—cutting off access to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, and more—VPN signups exploded by over 8,000%. What followed was five days of digital darkness, nationwide protests, and tragically, at least 19 deaths before the ban was lifted.

This wasn't Nepal's first brush with internet censorship. From the TikTok ban in 2023 to ongoing blocks on cryptocurrency and gambling sites, Nepal's digital landscape remains unpredictable. With a freedom index score of just 62/100, Nepal faces significant restrictions on internet freedom, making a reliable VPN not just convenient—but essential.

Whether you're a student accessing YouTube tutorials, a remote worker securing your connection, a content creator maintaining your livelihood, or simply someone who values digital privacy, this guide will help you choose the best VPN for Nepal in 2025.

# Why Nepal Desperately Needs VPNs in 2025

The September 2025 social media blackout exposed a harsh reality: digital access in Nepal can vanish overnight. The government ordered ISPs to block platforms that failed to register locally, instantly cutting off millions from their primary means of communication, education, and business.

**The current threat landscape in Nepal includes:**

* **Government censorship**: Authorities can block websites and platforms with little warning, as demonstrated by the recent social media ban and previous TikTok restrictions
* **Surveillance concerns**: Nepal's government has shown increasing interest in monitoring online activities, raising privacy concerns for journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens
* **Geo-restrictions**: Major streaming platforms like Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max aren't officially available in Nepal, while Netflix and Amazon Prime offer limited libraries
* **Public Wi-Fi vulnerabilities**: Kathmandu's café culture means many rely on unsecured networks, exposing banking and personal data to potential theft
* **ISP throttling**: Some internet service providers deliberately slow connections during peak hours or for specific services

According to Freedom House's latest report, global internet freedom declined for the 14th consecutive year, with Nepal part of a broader regional trend toward digital control. Countries across Asia have implemented similar social media restrictions in 2025, including Indonesia, Turkey, and Pakistan.

# Is Using a VPN Legal in Nepal?

**Yes, VPNs are completely legal in Nepal** when used for legitimate purposes. There is no law explicitly banning VPN usage, and many businesses, banks, and government offices use VPNs for security.

However, Nepal Police's Cyber Bureau issued an important warning in September 2025: **avoid free, unauthorized, or unreliable VPN services**. These pose serious security risks including:

* Personal data leaks and identity theft
* Banking app hacks and financial losses
* Malware and virus infections
* Data harvesting and sale to third parties

The key distinction is this: **VPN use is legal; what you do with it determines legality**. Using a VPN to access blocked websites for legitimate purposes (education, work, communication) is perfectly acceptable. Using a VPN for illegal activities (hacking, fraud, distributing illegal content) remains illegal regardless of the tool used.

# What Makes a Great VPN for Nepal?

Not all VPNs perform equally in Nepal's unique environment. Based on extensive testing and analysis of Nepal's internet infrastructure, here are the critical features you need:

**Essential Security Features:**

* **AES-256 encryption**: Industry-standard protection that even supercomputers can't crack
* **Independently audited no-logs policy**: Verified promise that your browsing history isn't recorded
* **Kill switch**: Automatically cuts internet if VPN drops, preventing accidental data exposure
* **DNS/IP leak protection**: Ensures your real location never slips through

**Nepal-Specific Requirements:**

* **Servers in or near Nepal**: Virtual or physical servers in Nepal, India, or Singapore minimize latency and maximize speeds
* **Obfuscation technology**: Disguises VPN traffic as regular HTTPS, crucial if Nepal implements VPN blocking like Venezuela
* **Fast speeds on local ISPs**: Must work reliably with WorldLink, Vianet, DishHome, and Nepal Telecom

**Practical Considerations:**

* **Streaming capability**: Unblocks Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, Hulu, and regional content
* **Multi-device support**: Protect phones, laptops, tablets, and smart TVs simultaneously
* **24/7 customer support**: Critical when dealing with sudden blocks or connection issues
* **Affordable pricing**: VPN cost shouldn't exceed streaming subscriptions

# 5 Best VPNs for Nepal in 2025

After testing dozens of VPN services from multiple locations in Nepal and evaluating their performance on major Nepali ISPs, these five providers stand out for security, speed, and reliability.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall VPN for Nepal

# Free VPNs for Nepal: A Dangerous Gamble

During the September 2025 social media ban, many Nepalis rushed to install free VPNs without understanding the risks. Nepal Police's Cyber Bureau explicitly warned against this practice—and for good reason.

**Why Free VPNs Are Dangerous:**

**Security Risks:**

* **Data harvesting**: Free VPNs often sell your browsing history, personal information, and connection data to advertisers
* **Malware injection**: Some free VPNs inject malicious code or display dangerous advertisements
* **Banking vulnerabilities**: Unencrypted connections can expose financial information
* **Identity theft**: Poor security practices make you more vulnerable, not less

**Performance Issues:**

* **Severe speed limits**: Often restricted to 2 Mbps or less, making streaming impossible
* **Data caps**: Typically 500 MB to 10 GB per month—used up in hours
* **Server congestion**: Free servers are overcrowded, resulting in constant disconnections
* **Limited locations**: Usually only 3-10 server locations available

**Hidden Dangers:**

* **Chinese ownership**: A 2025 investigation found 18 popular free VPNs sharing data with Chinese companies, potentially exposing users to CCP surveillance
* **No privacy protection**: Free VPNs rarely have audited no-logs policies and may keep extensive records
* **Unreliable during crises**: Free services often fail precisely when you need them most, as happened during recent censorship events

**The Bottom Line:** As Nepal Police warned, free VPNs create more problems than they solve. For less than the cost of a cup of coffee per month ($2-3), premium VPNs like Surfshark or NordVPN provide genuine security, unlimited data, and reliable performance.

# How to Use a VPN in Nepal Safely

Setting up a VPN properly ensures maximum security and performance. Follow these steps for safe VPN use in Nepal:

**Initial Setup (5 minutes):**

1. **Choose a reputable VPN** from our recommendations above
2. **Sign up** using a secure email (avoid free email providers if privacy is critical)
3. **Download** the official app from the provider's website or official app store
4. **Install** and log in with your credentials
5. **Enable the kill switch** in settings (critical for preventing leaks)
6. **Turn on obfuscation** if available (especially important in Nepal)

**Daily Usage Best Practices:**

* **Connect before browsing**: Always activate VPN before opening any apps or websites
* **Choose nearby servers**: For general browsing, connect to Indian or Singapore servers for best speeds
* **Use Nepal servers** when accessing local banking, eSewa, Khalti, or government services that might block foreign IPs
* **Test for leaks** regularly using ipleak.net or dnsleaktest.com
* **Keep apps updated**: Install updates promptly for latest security patches
* **Enable auto-connect**: Configure VPN to activate automatically on untrusted Wi-Fi networks

**Security Verification:**

After connecting, verify your VPN is working properly:

1. Visit [ipleak.net](http://ipleak.net) while connected
2. Check that your IP address shows the VPN server location, not Nepal
3. Verify no DNS leaks appear
4. Confirm WebRTC isn't leaking your real IP
5. Test the kill switch by forcing a disconnection

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

* **Slow speeds?** Switch to a different server or try WireGuard protocol
* **Connection drops?** Enable obfuscation or try a different protocol
* **Can't access banking apps?** Use a Nepal server or add banking apps to VPN split tunneling exclusions
* **Streaming not working?** Clear browser cache and cookies, then reconnect to a different server

# VPN Use Cases for Nepal in 2025

**Accessing Blocked Social Media:** During censorship events like the September 2025 ban, VPNs were the only way to access Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and WhatsApp. Connect to any server outside Nepal to bypass local blocks.

**Streaming International Content:** Netflix Nepal's library is limited compared to US or UK catalogs. Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max aren't available at all. A VPN unlocks thousands of additional movies and shows by connecting to servers in those regions.

**Secure Remote Work:** Many international companies require VPNs for remote employees to access corporate networks securely. This is essential for protecting confidential business data, especially on public Wi-Fi.

**Safe Banking on Public Wi-Fi:** Kathmandu's café culture means many people handle banking on unsecured networks. A VPN encrypts your connection, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks that could steal your credentials.

**Avoiding ISP Throttling:** Some Nepali ISPs slow down connections during peak hours or for specific services. A VPN prevents ISPs from seeing what you're doing, making it harder to throttle your connection based on activity.

**Accessing Expat Services:** If you're a Nepali living abroad or an expat in Nepal, VPNs help you access services that verify location—from banking apps to regional streaming platforms.

**Content Creation and YouTube:** Nepal's YouTubers and content creators need reliable access to platforms for their livelihoods. VPNs ensure continuous access even during government restrictions.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will using a VPN slow down my internet?** A: Quality VPNs like NordVPN and Surfshark typically reduce speeds by only 10-20%. In our tests, we achieved 80+ Mbps on 100 Mbps connections—more than enough for 4K streaming. Free VPNs, however, often reduce speeds by 70% or more.

**Q: Can the Nepali government block VPNs?** A: While technically possible, Nepal hasn't implemented VPN blocks. However, using VPNs with obfuscation (like NordVPN or ExpressVPN) protects against potential future blocks by disguising VPN traffic as regular HTTPS.

**Q: Do I need a VPN if I'm not doing anything illegal?** A: Absolutely. VPNs protect against multiple threats: ISP snooping, public Wi-Fi hackers, data harvesting by websites, ISP throttling, and sudden government censorship. Privacy is a right, not just for those with ""something to hide.""

**Q: Will a VPN work with my Nepali banking apps?** A: Most work fine, but some banking apps detect VPN use and may block access. Solution: Use your VPN's Nepal server, or add the banking app to split tunneling exclusions so it uses your regular connection while everything else goes through the VPN.

**Q: Can I watch Netflix US from Nepal?** A: Yes, all five VPNs recommended in this guide successfully unblock Netflix US, UK, and other regions. Simply connect to a server in your desired country before opening Netflix.

**Q: How much should I pay for a VPN?** A: Quality VPNs range from $2-7/month for long-term plans. We strongly recommend Surfshark ($2.19/month) for budget users or NordVPN ($3.39/month) for the best overall features. Avoid free VPNs entirely.

**Q: What if my VPN doesn't work during a social media ban?** A: This is why we recommend VPNs with obfuscation (NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark). During the September 2025 ban, users with obfuscation-capable VPNs had no issues. Contact 24/7 support if problems arise—they can recommend specific servers.

# Final Verdict: Stay Safe, Stay Connected

Nepal's digital landscape changed dramatically in September 2025 when the government demonstrated its willingness to shut down major platforms overnight. While the ban was lifted after protests, the message was clear: digital access in Nepal is fragile and unpredictable.

A VPN isn't just about bypassing censorship—it's about protecting your fundamental right to privacy, securing your data from theft, and maintaining access to the tools and information you need for education, work, and life.

**Our Top Recommendation:**

For most Nepali users, **NordVPN** offers the best combination of security, speed, server coverage, and features. Its independently audited no-logs policy, automatic obfuscation, virtual Nepal servers, and extensive security features make it the most reliable choice for Nepal's unpredictable internet environment. At $3.39/month with a 30-day money-back guarantee, it's worth every paisa.

**Budget Pick:**

If price is your primary concern, **Surfshark** at $2.19/month with unlimited device connections provides exceptional value without compromising security. Perfect for families or students.

**Censorship-Proof Option:**

For users who prioritize bypassing restrictions above all else, **ExpressVPN** with its automatic obfuscation and Lightway protocol is the most reliable choice during government crackdowns.

**Important Reminder:** Whatever VPN you choose, avoid free services. As Nepal Police warned, free VPNs pose serious security risks. Invest in a reputable paid VPN—your privacy, security, and digital freedom are worth the small monthly cost.

Stay safe, stay connected, and exercise your right to a free and open internet. Nepal's digital future may be uncertain, but with the right tools, your access doesn't have to be.

Casual conversation is fine if it happens, but I'm definitely not going out looking to meet people. Just something with a nice relaxed vibe I could sit at for an evening.

This might be a venting post. Consider this as a judgment-free-rant. I work in a company where I am a solo tech lead. Its a consulting firm so you know how the environment is. The worst of all, its white-company. Although, I never thought of it. I always felt like they treat me as if I don't belong here. Despite my skills and pulling off things and fast tracking the company's growth (I brought them from dark ages to modern age in terms of tech), they still treat me for my skin color. My opinions are always invalidated outside work talks. No one invites me for coffee. Its a 20 people firm.

Some people are sweet. They talk well and give me the same respect. But, in group they talk among themselves. Even if I am there, I feel like an outsider. I dress better, have exceptional communication skills. smell better and gives a pleasant talk when someone initiates a conversation with me. I m not gloating this because people think Indians lack these. But it is the truth, and I am not one among them.

One instance is that I brought a treat for everyone in office. Something I got from a super market. No one touched! I sometime feel like they are just uncomfortable that I am Indian. All I wanted was to have a friendly environment in work. But I feel like this subtle and casual racism is questioning everything that I believed that is good among Canadians.

Now I know you all can say, ""Resign and join somewhere better"". But you know, I love my job and I love what I do here. I dont give a flying fuck about skin color but it really hurts and it feels lonely living abroad and working alone. I moved to Toronto 9 months ago and I don't have friends here so its kinda lonely sometimes too.

The UEFA Europa League and Conference League are about to serve up a Thursday night smorgasbord of European chaos, featuring Spanish clubs with delusions of grandeur, underdogs with “unbeaten nine-match streaks” (translation: they haven’t lost to *anyone* since 2018), and a Ghanian striker who’s probably thinking, *“Why am I here? I just wanted to play for a team called ‘Shkendija’?”*  

**Spanish Teams: The “We’re Not Total Disasters” Edition**  
Celta Vigo, fresh off a *mildly impressive* 3-0 thrashing of PAOK, strut into Balaídos to face Nice, who are so desperate for points they’ll probably start their goalkeepers in midfield. Real Betis, meanwhile, are in Belgium to face Genk, because nothing says “continental ambition” like playing in a stadium that smells faintly of beer and regret. And Rayo Vallecano? They’re in Gothenburg, where the weather is so bad even the grass is probably crying. Their manager’s “no limits” speech is either poetic or a cry for help—we’ll see if it translates to goals or just a lot of hand-wringing.  

**The “We’re Not Even Sure How We’re Here” Bracket**  
Steaua Bucarest vs. Bologna? Sky and NOW are *generously* streaming it, but let’s be real: if you’re not paying for premium TV, you’re watching this on a phone in a coffee shop, pretending you’re a European football connoisseur. And poor Bologna? They’re probably thinking, *“Why are we playing Steaua? Shouldn’t we be facing someone who actually knows how to score goals?”*  

**Irish Teams: The “We’re Here, We’re Hopeless, Get Used to It” Saga**  
Shelbourne and Shamrock Rovers are out to prove that Irish football is *not* a punchline. Shelbourne, fresh off a draw against Hacken, are now facing North Macedonian and Kosovan teams, which sounds less like football and more like a geopolitical summit. Shamrock Rovers? Their manager, Stephen Bradley, is probably muttering, *“I’ve seen more continuity in a lava lamp,”* after his squad’s complete overhaul. And let’s not forget KF Shkendija, the Macedonian underdogs who once humiliated FCSB in the Champions League. They’ve got a Ghanaian striker named Fabrice Tamba, who’s either a secret weapon or a guy who got lost on the way to a different continent.  

**Dynamo Kyiv vs. Samsunspor: The “Let’s Not Talk About the Last Five Losses” Showdown**  
Dynamo Kyiv, fresh off a five-game losing streak (their worst since *2019*—yes, that long ago), are heading to Turkey to face Samsunspor, who are on a six-game unbeaten run and probably thinking, *“We’re the kings of Europe now, baby!”* The bookies love Samsunspor at 2.00 odds, which means they’re 50% favorites. That’s the same chance as flipping a coin, but with more expensive jerseys. Dynamo’s coach, Oleksandr Shovkovskiy, is probably whispering, *“Remember, we’ve beaten Turkish clubs before… in 2021.”*  

**Crystal Palace: The “We’re Finally Hosting European Football, Let’s Not Embarrass Ourselves” Special**  
Oliver Glasner’s Crystal Palace squad is on a 21-game unbeaten streak in all competitions, which is either a miracle or a lie. They’re hosting AEK Larnaca, and Glasner is demanding “100% effort” from his players. Let’s hope they remember how to do that—last time they played, they drew 3-3 with Bournemouth and looked like they’d forgotten the rules.  

**Broadcasting: The “You’ll Need a Passport and a Credit Card” Edition**  
Want to watch all these matches? Good luck. Sky is only giving you one free match a day, and Movistar and MEGOGO are probably charging you in cryptocurrency. If you’re in Ireland, RTÉ is live-blogging, but let’s be honest: you’re just Googling the scores after work.

But what happened now is that for the past few days the situation was stable. But yesterday he was having a very important meeting with half of his subordinates as the year will end soon and our son kept pulling his arm because he wanted something from the fridge. I couldn't help. And my husband kept dismising him and told him he is busy and to go away and then called me to come and take him, while muting and unmuting his mic. Our son got frustrated too, started crying and in the end he spanked him so bad that my child fell to the floor. And then he ran to me crying and I talked to him and said dad didn't want to, but I will talk to him and he said its not the first time. And cried harder. 

OP

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

Even at the plant there were like 7 layers between us. I am in no managerial position. But we met actually outside of the office - its a medium size city and we started talking. Due to internal regulations I changed companies so I can have a real relationship with him. He helped me to find a job somewhere else and we became official. Got married within a year. And he helped me get back at the plant too, nothing prestigious. Just back on the position I was in. I didn't ask for favours. I don't report to him, but we found a workaround and I report to the headquarters.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

Michelle Obama recently gave her daughters Sasha and Malia some simple but *powerful* dating advice:

>

And I can’t stop thinking about how relevant this is for us, especially in the South Asian community.

We have this cultural expectation that dating = bad. That you either meet someone perfect on paper or don’t meet anyone at all. And many of my clients haven’t been on a single coffee date in over a year, yet say they *want* to get married.

But here’s the thing: dating isn’t a waste of time. It’s how you learn what you truly want in a partner, what your deal-breakers are, and yes — even what doesn’t work. A breakup now is *so much better* than a divorce 10 years down the line.

Think about it like a job interview. You wouldn’t take the first “perfect on paper” job without interviewing and seeing if it’s actually a fit, right? Dating is the same thing for your heart.

I want to know from this community:  
**How has dating (even if it didn’t lead to marriage) taught you about yourself or what you want in a partner?**

Let’s be honest — can we finally retire the idea that dating is “dirty” and start seeing it as part of the journey to finding the right person?

I have achieved this naturally over the last 4 and a half years by sticking religiously to OMAD albeit with quite a few 48hr and 72hr fasts.

It has changed my life, I feel as fit as I was at 16. I feel sharp as a tac mentally and physically.

I am proud to say that every day since Feb 2021 I have fasted a min of 18hrs, even when abroad on holiday.

To everyone reading this who is considering or just starting OMAD keep doing it, consistency is key, there will be plateaus but with consistency your bodies set weight will come down. The first 2-3 weeks are the hardest but it will become so easy for you. I promise.

Please feel free to ask any questions via dm or on here.

I took the chance to learn more about my personality type as well.

As I was particularly diving deep into ENFP's inferiority function (Introverted Sensing, Si), there was a particular section talking about how ENFP's feel trapped by repetition or predictability and that somewhat opened my eyes and it had me reflect on the past year of my life. I had been running away from everything that was happening in life and indulging myself in reading comfort webcomics etc. As the months passed, I kept hating myself for running away and fixating on the fact that I'm falling behind my classmates. Now, I finally understand why I was running away. I was tired and burnt out of the school routine and I just wanted to be free. I didn't have stability and ground to my imagination. 

I finally found a purpose in my life recently so I'm not running away anymore and I finally feel grown up. I made coffee for myself yesterday and I drank it without any sugar. That's really crazy.

I decided to write a book about:  
 \- academic burnout x academic achiever  
\- this book would explore complex emotional topics such as: pressure due to expectations, inferiority complex, jealousy, depression and anxiety, quarter life crisis feels etc.  
  
It's still in the research and planning stage.

I (guy, uni student) have plans to meet up with another guy from my university this weekend. We’ve been hanging out a lot lately — grabbing coffee, spending breaks together, walking around campus. And honestly? I’m starting to like him.

The thing is: he gives me mixed signals. Sometimes he gives off totally straight vibes, but other times he acts super soft, gentle, and emotionally tuned-in. It feels like there could be something more — or maybe I’m reading too much into it.

This will be the first time we hang out outside of uni, just the two of us.
We’re meeting in his town, and he suggested we could get a meal or dinner — depending on what I feel like. I know, I might be overthinking, but I’m trying to feel out the energy here.

Now, I want to find a subtle, lighthearted way to figure out if he might be into guys — or at least open to the idea. Nothing too direct, just something that gives him the opportunity to share more, if he wants to. And I had two little stories I could maybe drop into the conversation:

⸻

Option 1: The American guy who slapped my butt :
I once went to a local café with my best friend to play pool.
There were some drunk Americans there who started playing with us — and at one point, I leaned forward to take a shot and one of them full-on slapped my butt. 😅

I was thinking about : 

“Should I act like a typical straight guy now? You know… get all angry, start a fight or something?”
But instead I just laughed it off, and the moment stuck with me — especially how many straight guys would’ve reacted so aggressively to something like that.

So I thought:

Maybe if I tell this story and say something like “I didn’t know if I should act like a straight guy…”
— he might read between the lines? Or is that too subtle?

⸻

Option 2: The LGBTQ class dynamics
Our uni group is super international — people from all over.
Some of them are queer, and I thought about casually saying something like:

“It’s always funny when someone’s LGBTQ and nobody notices at first, and then you slowly see the energy shift once people figure it out.”

And then just follow up with:

“Do you pick up on stuff like that easily? Or do you not really pay attention to those things?”

⸻

I just want to give him a soft opening, in case there’s something he wants to share. Of course, he might just be a sweet straight guy who enjoys my company — and that’s okay.
But if there’s even a little spark, I’d really love to know.

It broke something in me. I hope will heal someday but I’m not there yet, I’m not even fully out of the woods (still 2-3 hours of inconsolable crying most days). 

I miss what my life was like before I knew this was even possible. I don’t know how to just start acting like he’s a “normal baby”. I live in fear of an episode in a coffee shop, or at a cousins house. People say “we’re all moms it’s ok if babies cry” but their babies don’t cry like that.

1oe6szy,https://i.redd.it/of0v4pc4uvwf1.jpeg,🦀STRIKE,"
According to the government, resident doctors are somehow both:
Too essential to strike, because patients will literally die without us , yet not worth more than £20 an hour.
So which is it? Life-saving professionals, or disposable shift workers? Make it make sense.
From day one, doctors have worked tirelessly for the public. We’ve done everything asked of us, and more.
We excelled in GCSEs, A-Levels, and university entrance exams, often outperforming peers just to secure a single place at medical school. We then studied full-time for five or six years, many of us working part-time jobs to support ourselves, while volunteering, researching, and passing gruelling annual exams and OSCEs.
And what’s our reward for all that dedication?
We’re randomly allocated jobs anywhere in the country, with no say in location. We work ~48-hour weeks (before counting overtime), covering wards and emergency departments that are chronically understaffed and overstretched. We care for patients at their most vulnerable, often while running on empty ourselves, fuelled by overpriced coffee.
Now, the government has increased medical school places without increasing postgraduate training positions, all while welcoming overseas doctors to fill gaps. The result? Thousands of exceptional, UK-trained doctors are being shut out of specialty training, facing unemployment after years of education and service provision. That’s not just personal loss; it’s a waste of public money, talent, and the future workforce of the NHS.

Now, let’s talk numbers;
We graduate with five or six years of debt, often exceeding £100,000. We repay 9% of our income above the threshold, yet the salaries are so low that most doctors never clear the balance, effectively turning the student loan into a 9% lifelong surtax. It’s a financial penalty for choosing to train as a doctor, a burden that other professionals don’t face because their training is shorter and their pay higher.
After graduating, a new doctor earns about £38,000 a year. A physician associate, with just two years of training, can start on more than £46,000. Yet from day one, doctors hold full clinical and legal responsibility for every decision they make. Yes, pay increases with experience, but I can’t pay my rent and bills today with the promise of a pay progression in the future.
And the costs don’t stop there. Unlike many professions where registration, insurance, and ongoing training are covered by employers, NHS doctors pay out of pocket for their GMC registration, medical college memberships, exam fees, question banks, indemnity insurance, and even their own stethoscopes. These essential costs amount to thousands of pounds each year, straight from already squeezed take-home pay. And don’t get me started on having to pay for damn parking…

So feel enraged.
Be furious that those who call us “heroes” in one breath devalue us in the next. Be angry that our years of training, sacrifice, and service are treated as disposable. That we are expected to give endlessly, to heal a system designed to break us, and to do it all with a smile.
Because enough is enough.
So stand tall. Stand together. Strike for a better tomorrow. ",28,1761234402.0,doctorsUK,1,0.97,False

I tried to be understanding for a long time, but a couple things led to me pulling back from the friendship. I will say she is very social- she’ll join groups and meet friends and is more socially involved than most. 
We had started to talk about creating a a friends group together because I had moved and she seemed to want to help me get connected in my new community and all of a sudden she ignored any conversation about that. She would talk about other things, but completely ignored my questions whether she still wanted to do the group etc. 
We had a party and for one too many times, she cancelled just before the party was supposed to start.
The next time she reached out to talk to me, I still responded but was starting to really feel done with the friendship. 
The final straw was when I invited her to my birthday dinner. It’s bad when I already know especially when she doesn’t acknowledge the invite she won’t show. Again, very last minute like 10 minutes before it starts she said she wasn’t going to make it and gave a lame excuse. I never responded, but when she texted me again a couple of days later just to shoot the breeze, I was polite and responded.
We normally invite our kids to each other’s birthday parties, but the next birthday party for one of my kids, I didn’t send her an invite.
We recently saw each other at a function, we hugged hello but she made it very obvious she didn’t want to talk to me. I understand the tension, and at one point went and sat down with her and another friend to try and break the awkwardness, and she completely ignored me. So we got up and left, after a tense hug goodbye.
We saw each other at one other function, and at that point I was completely over it. I made no effort to go over and try to talk, and when I was leaving, I waved goodbye although I could tell she was waiting to give me a hug. 
I should say I’m in an area where everybody is very huggy when it comes to girlfriends or Frenemies. It doesn’t necessarily reflect true friendship to hug someone.
Most recently, at one of my friend groups. The host told me that she has been asking about me. She apparently encouraged her to reach out to me, and the friend has asked to go for coffee. When I asked her what she wanted to talk about, she said things have been “off” when we’ve seen each other and she realizes we haven’t talked very recently and wants to catch up. 

I’m debating what to do. I’ll be honest, I’m at a point in my life where I don’t have much energy for lukewarm friends or drama. I can empathize with where some of these actions come from, but I don’t feel like taking time out of my day for an awkward sit down where we either A. Sweep stuff under the rug and we act like friends or B. Where stuff gets brought up and I have to confront someone’s character- there was a time I would be willing to do this but now I just don’t feel like being in that role. It’s not my responsibility to tell someone why they aren’t a good friend. 
Should I go and just hear her out? Has this worked well for anyone?
Or should I come up with a reason to not go and let things blow over and be whatever they’ll be?",1,1761234293.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False
1oe6r6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/1oe6r6h/would_you_stop_to_watch_a_short_video_ad_playing/,Would you stop to watch a short video ad playing in your favorite coffee shop?,"You ever catch yourself waiting for your order, kind of half on your phone, half zoning out and a nearby screen starts playing something that actually grabs your attention?

Maybe it’s a quick ad for a local bakery or a new salon down the street. It’s quiet, short, and somehow just fits the vibe of the place.

For a few seconds, you actually look up and it sticks with you. That’s what I find interesting about digital screens in cafés and shops: they don’t really interrupt you, they just blend in with the moment.

So I’m curious, if you were at your favorite coffee shop and a short video ad came on, would you watch it? Or are we all too locked into our phones now?",1,1761234291.0,digital_marketing,3,1.0,False

1oe6qf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1oe6qf0/best_vpn_for_california/,Best VPN for California,"California residents enjoy some of the strongest digital privacy protections in the United States, but these laws alone aren't enough to keep your online activities truly private. With the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) recently strengthened by new regulations effective January 2026, and the state's gold-standard net neutrality law (SB-822) protecting against ISP throttling, you might think Californians are fully protected online. However, **a VPN remains essential for complete digital security and privacy**.

Recent data reveals why California residents face unique cybersecurity challenges. In April 2025, Blue Shield of California suffered a breach exposing 4.7 million members' data. The financial sector reported 387 data compromises in the first half of 2025 alone, with California-based tech companies frequently targeted. While CCPA gives you rights over collected data, **VPNs prevent that data collection from happening in the first place**.

# Why California Residents Need a VPN Despite Strong Privacy Laws

California's CCPA/CPRA amendments give residents unprecedented control over their personal information, including the right to know what data businesses collect, delete that data, and opt-out of data sales. The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) has imposed millions in fines for violations, including a recent $1.35 million settlement against Tractor Supply for CCPA violations.

However, these laws have limitations:

**What CCPA protects:** Your rights after data is collected by businesses **What CCPA doesn't prevent:** ISPs, websites, and advertisers from collecting your data in the first place

California's SB-822 net neutrality law prevents ISPs from blocking, throttling, or engaging in paid prioritization—protections that became even more critical after federal net neutrality was struck down by the Sixth Circuit Court in January 2025. While this stops ISPs from slowing your connection, **it doesn't prevent them from monitoring and logging your browsing history**.

A VPN encrypts your internet traffic before it reaches your ISP, making it impossible for them to see what websites you visit, what you download, or what you stream. This proactive approach complements California's privacy laws by preventing data collection rather than just controlling it after the fact.

# Top Security Threats Facing California Internet Users

California's position as the tech capital of America makes its residents high-value targets for cybercriminals. The state has implemented strict breach notification requirements—as of January 1, 2026, businesses must notify affected residents within 30 days of discovering a breach (SB 446).

**Key threats in 2025:**

* **Ransomware attacks** targeting healthcare and financial institutions
* **Phishing campaigns** exploiting public WiFi networks in major cities
* **Credential theft** from the massive 16 billion credential leak discovered in June 2025
* **Third-party vulnerabilities** affecting cloud services and software platforms
* **Misconfigured systems** leading to unintentional data exposure

Public WiFi networks in California's bustling coffee shops, airports, and coworking spaces present particular risks. Without encryption, your sensitive data—from banking credentials to work emails—can be intercepted by cybercriminals on the same network.

# Best VPNs for California in 2025

# 1. NordVPN: The Best Overall Choice for California

**Why NordVPN tops our list:** After extensive testing, NordVPN emerges as the best VPN for California residents due to its comprehensive security features, excellent local server performance, and verified privacy protections that complement the state's privacy laws.

**California-specific advantages:**

* **Local servers in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose** for optimal speeds and low latency
* **7,200+ servers across 118 countries** for traveling Californians
* **NordLynx protocol** delivering speeds over 950 Mbps—perfect for California's high-speed internet infrastructure
* **Verified no-logs policy** audited by Deloitte in 2025, ensuring your data isn't stored
* **Panama-based headquarters** outside US jurisdiction, providing additional privacy layer beyond CCPA protections

**Security features ideal for California threats:**

* **Threat Protection Pro** blocks malware, phishing sites, and trackers—critical given the surge in phishing attacks
* **Post-quantum encryption** protects against future quantum computing threats
* **Dark Web Monitor** alerts you if your credentials appear in data breaches
* **Kill switch and DNS leak protection** ensure your California IP address never leaks

**California presence:** Multiple US servers with MediaStreamer feature for devices that don't support VPNs. Excellent for accessing US content while traveling abroad.

**Pricing:** $6.67/month on annual plans with a 30-day money-back guarantee.

# 4. CyberGhost: Most User-Friendly Option

CyberGhost offers dedicated streaming servers optimized for popular US platforms and provides the most California server locations among competitors. The interface is extremely beginner-friendly with one-click connection.

**Advantage:** 45-day money-back guarantee—the longest in the industry—gives you ample time to test performance across California's varied internet infrastructure.

**Pricing:** Plans start at $2.11/month on 2-year subscriptions.

**Standout feature:** Open-source applications allow security-conscious Californians to audit the code themselves.

# How to Choose the Right VPN for California

When selecting a VPN as a California resident, prioritize these features:

**Essential security features:**

* **AES-256 encryption** (military-grade standard)
* **Verified no-logs policy** with independent audits
* **Kill switch** to prevent data leaks
* **DNS leak protection**
* **Malware and phishing protection** (given recent threat increases)

**Performance requirements:**

* **Servers in California cities** for optimal local speeds
* **10 Gbps server capacity** to match California's high-speed internet
* **Proven streaming capabilities** for US content platforms
* **P2P support** for secure torrenting

**Privacy considerations:**

* **Jurisdiction outside Five Eyes** (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand)
* **Regular security audits** by independent firms
* **Transparent privacy policy** complying with CCPA standards
* **Secure payment options** including cryptocurrency

# Practical VPN Use Cases for California Residents

**Protecting public WiFi connections:** Whether you're working from a San Francisco coffee shop or using LAX airport WiFi, a VPN encrypts your connection to prevent data interception.

**Avoiding ISP surveillance:** While SB-822 prevents throttling, ISPs can still log your browsing history. A VPN ensures complete privacy from your internet provider.

**Secure remote work:** With California's large remote workforce, VPNs protect corporate data when accessing company resources from home or public locations.

**Streaming without restrictions:** Access your US content libraries when traveling internationally, or bypass regional sports blackouts within California.

**Financial transactions:** Encrypt banking and shopping activities, especially important given the 387 financial sector breaches in early 2025.

# Setting Up Your VPN: Quick Start Guide

1. **Choose your VPN provider** based on your specific needs (we recommend NordVPN for most California users)
2. **Subscribe and download** the appropriate app for your devices
3. **Install and log in** using your credentials
4. **Connect to a California server** for local browsing or another location for geo-unblocking
5. **Enable security features** like kill switch, Threat Protection, and auto-connect
6. **Verify your connection** using DNS leak tests to ensure your California IP is hidden

**Pro tip:** Use the Quick Connect feature to automatically select the fastest available server based on your location.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Is it legal to use a VPN in California?** Yes, VPN use is completely legal in California and throughout the United States. VPNs are legitimate privacy tools used by individuals and businesses alike.

**Will a VPN slow down my internet speed?** Modern VPNs like NordVPN cause minimal speed reduction. In our tests, speed loss was typically under 10% when connecting to nearby California servers. Some users even experience faster speeds if their ISP was throttling specific traffic.

**Can my ISP see I'm using a VPN?** Your ISP can see that you're connected to a VPN server, but they cannot see what you're doing online. All they observe is encrypted data traffic—the content remains completely private.

**Do I need a VPN if I have nothing to hide?** Privacy isn't about hiding—it's about controlling who has access to your personal information. With data breaches affecting millions of Californians in 2025, protecting your data is essential regardless of your online activities.

**Will a VPN work with my California-based streaming services?** Yes, quality VPNs work seamlessly with US streaming platforms. NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN all reliably access Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max, and other services available in California.

# Conclusion: Protecting Your Digital Life in California

California leads the nation in privacy protection with CCPA/CPRA and net neutrality laws, but these regulations alone can't guarantee complete online security. The surge in data breaches throughout 2025—from Blue Shield's 4.7 million affected members to the massive credential leaks—demonstrates that proactive protection is essential.

**A VPN provides the encryption layer that California's privacy laws don't address**, preventing data collection before it happens rather than just controlling it afterward. For California residents, NordVPN offers the best combination of local server performance, advanced security features, and verified privacy protections that complement the state's legal framework.

The 30-day money-back guarantees offered by top VPN providers give you risk-free opportunities to test performance on your specific internet connection. Given California's position as both a tech hub and prime target for cybercriminals, investing in a quality VPN isn't just recommended—it's essential for protecting your digital privacy in 2025 and beyond.

**Take action today:** Choose a VPN provider, enable security features, and take control of your online privacy. Your future self will thank you the next time a data breach headline hits the news.",1,1761234243.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

1oe6fel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/1oe6fel/why_korean_bosses_like_latte_라떼는_말이야/,Why Korean Bosses like Latte? (라떼는 말이야),"안녕하세요! I’m back with this week’s new expression and video. 

""라떼는 말이야~"" 
This expression is one of the most popular Korean memes ever.
You’ll hear it in dramas, variety shows, and even real-life offices all the time.

In Korea, when an older person starts a sentence with
“라떼는 말이야~ (Latte neun maliya~)”,
it sounds like “latte” (the coffee) 
but it actually comes from “나 때는 말이야,” which means “Back in my day…”

It’s a funny way older Koreans begin nostalgic or “lecture-style” stories,
like: “Back in my day, we worked late but had passion!” 

So this meme phrase became super popular 
because every Korean has heard it at least once from a teacher, a parent, or… a boss at work.

And here’s the fun part, sometimes even Koreans make visual jokes out of it!
We use a horse (말 / ‘mal’) emoji drinking a latte to literally show “나 때는 말이야”
(because in Korean, “mal” means horse, and the phrase sounds like “latte is a horse”). 
You might see memes in Kakao chatrooms showing a horse sipping a latte whenever someone acts old-fashioned or starts lecturing. 

In this short, our foreign rabbit character misunderstands “라떼” as the actual latte coffee, until she realizes the real meaning.
And ten years later… she becomes the “Latte Boss” herself.

You can check out a short, fun video related to this on my profile or my youtube channel(Beezit Korea). This short video is something I personally planned, scripted, and edited myself. I used a bit of AI technology only to help with the visual scenes, but every idea, story, and explanation in it was created by me. I hope it helps learners enjoy both the Korean language and culture together.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this post! If you ever have questions about Korean language or culture, please feel free to leave a comment anytime. I’ll do my best to answer and help you understand it better.",21,1761233545.0,Korean,2,0.96,False

Die?

A battlefield. Corpses of \[Players\] and \[NPCs\] layered thick upon the ground. Scattered and broken. Wretches and remnants of their former selves. Nowhere to run. Nowhere to even walk. The sloshing of mingled blood accompanied each shifting of boot to ground. How had it come to this? Come to such conflict? To such an end?

To war?

\[Players\] battled against other \[Players\] and monsters alike. \[Player\] versus \[Player\], \[PvP\], but there were no rules of engagement in this. No honor, no experience, nor promise of loot or rewards. Just slaughter for slaughter’s sake.

“Help… me,” he heard—faint, just barely an echo among the cacophony of destruction. “*Please…*” The last was weaker than the first.

He jammed his oddly shaped weapon into the ground, pushing himself up. His legs wobbled—his muscles heavy. Sweat poured into his eyes and he had to keep reminding himself repeatedly that this wasn’t real. None of this was real. Well… except if he died.

That—That would be very real.

“I’m… coming,” he croaked with all the breath he had left.

A cough wracked his body, and he reached up to stifle it. Glancing, his gauntlets were covered in thick red blood. \[Orc\] blood. His blood.

He stepped forward and over a corpse. Another foot and over the severed leg of a monster. Then its arm. Then its head. In its eyes there was surprise, as if it were real. Why had the developers programmed them as such? Did they want the \[Players\] to contemplate the cycle of life and death, even in this place of fantasy?

Each step forward was labored. Each step, deliberate. He paused and stared up. A bloody sun set above a red sky. Fitting. It was even one of the \[Keywords\] for this area. Why oh why had he come? Arrogance, that’s why. Pure ego. There was no other explanation.

A scream rattled his thoughts. Familiar and close. He had no time to flounder. No time to doubt. He was a defender. A protector.

… A tank.

He glanced to his left.

\[System\]

HP: Critical - Status: \[Last Stand\]

He had gone under zero and activated his \[Last Stand\] ability. Less than ten seconds till death if he did not receive healing. Can’t think about that now.

Must move.

Must protect.

Arrogance. He laughed—truly, this was the peak of vanity. Protect? Protect who? He could not even protect himself. He should have stayed in his chair. Stayed in his place. This world, and others like it, were not for those like him. Not for the weak of body. Not for the weak of mind. The weak of heart.

Finally, he saw it. The source of those screams. It was someone he knew. Someone he admired.

*Mariona!*

She held out her chalice defensively, her legs braced for impact. Directly in front of her was an angelic figure. Celestial… and wrong. Golden armor that glittered in the sun. A spear that looked to be made of light itself. But glitching—forever glitching. The air around them seemed to break apart into infinitesimally smaller pieces. This entity—this glorious goddess—had eyes of red, and the snarl of an animal that had turned against those that would dare proclaim themselves its masters. The spear went skyward and then flashed as it slid downward, slicing through reality itself.

Too late… He was too late.

The skills of his character flashed through his mind… *nothing!* He had nothing to save her.

Mariona turned at the moment of impact and caught his eye. Even though her features were filled with the horrors of death, she shot him one last innocent smile before the end. That was her way. Smiling until the last.

He closed his eyes. He did not wish to see. To witness her end. To witness his weakness made absolute. Then, the sounds of fighting ceased. All was still. Silent. A small ding rang in his ears…

He opened his eyes.

“Fucking alarm,” Cian said, grumbling to himself.

*Beep*

*Beep*

*Beep*

“*Enough*!” He slammed down on his phone with all the strength he had, and felt a shake rattle up his arm. It was so intense he felt it in his bones. He pulled back and held his quivering appendage.

Great… today was going to be rough.

Cian sat up and stretched, looking around the small room. It was bare—far more so than he had seen it before. Last night, hopefully, was the last he would spend in this room. College… somehow he had managed to pass high school, and now he was moving on. Flying the coop, so to speak.

He smiled. He had made it, despite what every doctor had told him. Looking to the right, he saw a familiar sight and frowned—

His wheelchair.

“Not without hardship,” he whispered to no one in particular.

Not without hardship indeed. He had spent much of his life laid up in that chair and in that bed and in that room. He couldn’t wait to get out. To escape.

“Breakfast,” he heard his mom call.

The last breakfast he would have here. He took a sort of oath to himself in that moment that, no matter how hard it got, no matter how much or fast his disease spread, he would not move back here. If he were to die, it would be on his terms. Preferably out in the world so that all could see him curse whatever god had made him this way. He would spit in his creator’s face when they came to collect his soul.

*Pshh, like god actually exists.*

*“Cian!*” she yelled.

“*I heard you!*” he replied, and even that small act took his breath away.

Cian… What a joke. His mother had told him it meant ‘Enduring.’ Perhaps it was her fault for his condition. He had been cursed from the offset to a short life. A painful one. He had long since been given that diagnosis. Doctor after doctor, test after test, confirmed the worst… he had \[The Sickness\]. He had learned about diseases of the past. Diseases like cancer, which killed an untold amount of people. Humanity had thought themselves above it all. Conquerors of even that which ails them.

It was not to be.

Near the end of the 21st century, a disease was born. One with no origin and no seeming cause. It cannot be spread, nor contracted… nor cured. For whatever reason, \[The Sickness\], as people have since called it, slowly saps the strength from its host. Gradually, almost like a bloodletting. It’s calculated in its manner—taking the smallest amount each day. As a child, while others became stronger and stronger, he found himself weaker and weaker. By ten, he could barely walk. By thirteen, wheelchair bound. Fifteen, unable to exercise due to weakened lungs. These days… Well, he even had trouble wheeling himself forward, and had to mostly rely on the built-in battery of the wheelchair. Pathetic… he could not even move himself around. If not for the time period in which he lived, he would have been left to the elements as a baby. Or abandoned in the woods. Sometimes… Sometimes he wished he had been. It would have been a better existence. An easier end.

But still… If he were to die now, it would be on his terms. His alone.

With newfound determination, Cian reached over, pulling the wheelchair to him. One by one, he slid his legs over and then, finally, hefted his body over the bar. He hit hard, and had to rest a moment before he put his hands to the controls, pressing the lever forward. Such an archaic thing… They had chairs which used an \[Enmity Core\] to read your thoughts and move you how you wished, but it was another side effect of the sickness… a weakened mind. Anything that used an \[Enmity Core\] threatened to overwhelm him. Potentially kill him.

Cian rolled into the room and went to his designated place at the table. No chair to obstruct his own. His mother was in the kitchen, wearing a black suit of sorts. Probably a board meeting planned later. She had taken additional responsibilities of late. More work. Sometimes he thought he was the reason she threw herself into work so heavily. So she wouldn’t need to be around him often. Needn’t need to be reminded of what he was. She stood above a sizzling frying pan, paying him little mind.

His father, on the other hand, had thrown himself into the arts. Writing, poetry, painting… you name it. He channeled his pain into the craft and, with technology where it was, jobs had become far more scarce than in the past. Or, at least, that was what he had been taught. Now, while some went to college to learn a trade or skill to help them with a future career, some went just for the experience of learning itself. The world was changing. There were ‘no more worlds left to conquer,’ and so, some people looked towards the stars. Others, the web. Mass transit had made entire nations more or less the cities of old. All humans now waited until humanity was star-bound and a new age of exploration would begin… but for now, they had the \[Coeus\], which is what had been previously known as the world wide web, or the internet. The plan was simple: use an \[Enmity Core\] to link your mind to the internet. But it had evolved and evolved rapidly. Soon, you weren’t just using your mind to move a cursor on a screen, but you instead were moved inside entirely. At least, your mind was.

He had only experienced the process once, for a brief moment. A lapse in judgement by an untrained teacher. The experience had utterly drained him, causing him to become violently ill and in need of a few days in hospital.

Interrupting his thoughts, his mom placed a plate of eggs and bread down in front of him. “Eat,” she said. “You’ll be on your own after today. Allow me this. One last time.”

Cian nodded.

He had always imagined there would be tears between them. Farewells and well wishes… but now he knew that they had both long since shed their tears. One year; that was his latest and last diagnosis.

One year.

He had one more year to experience something other than this place.

“You could always stay,” his father suggested, taking a sip of coffee and putting it to the table. “You have nothing to prove. Not to anyone. Not even yourself. You’ve… been through enough.”

“And stay here,” he asked, anger tinting his voice, “to die alone?”

“Not alone,” his father said. “Never alone.”

His father reached out, and Cian knocked his hand away. “I’ve got to go,” he said. “I’ve… got to.”

His father nodded, but then asked, “And do you still wish us to give you space?”

Cian nodded. “There would be little point if you were at my dorm every day. I wouldn’t appreciate it. And I’m sure my roommate wouldn’t either.”

“And what of him—your friend. Is he… ok with it?”

I breathed out slowly. “If you are asking if Zav will be ok with finding my corpse… Then yes, we’ve discussed it. He said—He said he would want it to be him over anyone else.”

His father nodded and took another sip of coffee. “Good friend.”

“The best,” Cian replied. Quietly, he added, “*And only.*”

His father stood and pushed in his chair. “Well, since your mother is busy, I suppose you’ll need a ride?”

Cian narrowed his eyes. “My stuff is already in your car. You know this already.”

“I know,” his father replied. “But it still seemed like I should ask. You’re your own man now. One who’s had to experience life far faster than most. Don’t let those others forget it.”

“I won’t,” Cian replied, taking his last bite.

He pushed the lever forward and made his way to the door. His father opened it and stepped outside. He turned to his mother. “This is it,” he said. “If we don’t see each other again, I…”

His mother turned and smiled. There was not a hint of sadness in her eyes. Only a far off look. The one you get when remembering someone long since gone. In her eyes, he had already passed. He supposed it was better this way. Better for them both.

They nodded to each other, and he rolled his way out the front door.

\*\*\*

Normally, in this age, having your own car would be considered a luxury. Long since AI had taken over the task of driving. Fewer idiots on the road. Fewer crashes. A more docile population. In special cases, one could receive a license if special accommodations were in order. Accommodations, such as being stuck in a wheelchair for most of your life. Besides… most of the population traveled little. It was unneeded with access to the \[Coeus\]. A strange name… from the mythology of ancient Greece. The son of Earth and Sky, whose name literally meant ‘To Question.’ Question what? Who? The earth’s problems have long since been solved… except the very one which plagued him.

It was only a few hours to Nue Angeles University, the place where he would spend the remainder of his life. Close enough that he convinced his parents to allow him to go there, but far enough that they couldn’t just pop in to see him. He felt regret at that. He loved them. Truly, he did. But it was hard looking at them at times. He could see it in their eyes—Dead dreams. So much they had sacrificed for him. They would never admit it, but he knew it to be true. No more… No more.

When they arrived, they pulled into the place meant for loading and unloading. There were few cars and even fewer people. This was unsurprising. It had been a rarer occurrence, with the advent of \[Coeus\], to even have a physical campus. But some traditions refuse to die. In this, he was grateful. His friend, Zav, had declared he would attend NAU in person and had practically begged him to go. It was the first seed of rebellion planted in his head. At first, he was against it, but with the latest diagnoses… Well, his time was limited. This was his only chance to live.

His father set the vehicle in park and exited, going to the back, loading a few of his bags on his shoulders and throwing one into his lap as he managed to unfold his wheelchair and sit. The bag hit his lap, knocking the air out of him.

“Sorry,” his father muttered, smiling mischievously.

Cian laughed. “Sure ya’ are.”

“We can still turn back,” his father said in a high-pitched, mocking voice.

Cian shook his head. “No. This is it. I’ve decided.”

His father smiled sadly. “Looks like you’re a man, after all. Come, let’s get you situated.”

*Dorm E, Room 205.* That was his destination.

His father and he didn’t mull around much. They found a map and went straight to the room. He would explore the campus himself later. Hell, he still needed to finalize his class schedule. They pulled up to the room in the E dorm that read, ‘2-0’ but was missing the ‘5’. Still, it was visible as the person who painted the door had not removed the letters when doing so, and the ‘5’ was highlighted in white where it had stripped the paint. He lifted a shaky hand to the keycard reader and heard a pop from beyond the door.

He pushed it open.

Two beds, two dingy wooden storage chests, stained carpet, and a single window in a room that couldn’t have been larger than 250 sq ft. His own room at home was larger than this.

His father coughed. “It’s… quant?”

“You can say that again,” he muttered.

His father hefted his bags onto the bed on the left. The right looks to have already been taken. Zav must have already come by.

His father scratched at his neck. “So then…”

“So…”

“I’m not good at this,” his father said. “So I’ll say this, if you need me, I’m only a small bit away. And if this is the last we see each other… I’ve always loved you, and I’ve never regretted it.”

Almost his words brought tears. Almost.

“I know… and thank you.”

His father nodded and, without another word, turned and closed the door behind him.

Cian looked again at his room, rolled to the side of the bed, pushed himself into it and stared up at the white ceiling.

Morbidly, he thought, *What if I died right now? My first act on my own?* He chuckled at the absurdity of it and fell asleep smiling.

\*\*\*

Cian awoke to the shifting of his bed. Opening his eyes, a familiar face greeted him.

“Zav,” he said groggily. “What are you doing in my bed?”

Zav, eighteen years of age, same as him, sat quietly at the edge, scratching at his neck, his black hair as tangled and disheveled as his clothing. He was a bit of an odd fellow. A fan of the 21st century. Of old things. He was into music called ‘grunge’ and rejected any stylistic choices from this century. Even now he wore a shirt, a yellow happy face, from a band he had mentioned before, but whose name eluded him at the moment.

“Finally,” Zav said. “Thought you had maybe kicked the bucket already.”

“Not quite.”

“Damn,” he replied. “Was hoping to get a more popular roommate. And once the ladies found out that I had held you in my arms as you were dying, and that your last wish was for me to find happiness… they’d have been all over me, like bees on sweet flowers.”

“Fuck you.”

“Fuck you back, buddy.”

Cian smiled. “Finally here… it feels like we’ve been waiting for an age.”

Zav gave him a curious look. “We only decided this a few months ago. More like that’s when I finally convinced you.”

“When you have as little time as me, you tend to savor the moment more.”

Zav frowned. “Oh, no… none of this. No pity party. You came here to live. So live! I won’t be hearing a damn word about dying.”

Cian forced a smile. “Fair enough. So… What do you want to do? Roll around the school?”

“It’s quite large,” Zav replied

“If you get tired, you can sit in my lap.”

“Now there’s a sight the ladies would certainly enjoy.” Zav laughed. “No, let’s stay in for the day. I’ve ordered us some food… and I’ve got you something else.”

Zav stood and reached into his pocket, pulling out a small chip.

“What program is that?” Cian asked, his \[Enmity Core\] itching ever so slightly.

“\[Everlight\],” Zav said.

“\[Everlight\]... the online game? Fantasy MMO?”

Zav nodded.

“You know I can’t,” Cian said. “The sickness… I can only use the \[Enmity Core\] for a few moments before I’m overwhelmed. Hell, even less if it’s taxing like a game.”

“And yet, you are going to try anyway. Come on now… live a little. You’ve never seen what these games are like. How real they feel. How freeing they are.”

“Because it may kill me.”

“Life is killing you,” Zav replied. “Or will you let fear control you still? Look… I’ve been looking up information; the \[Enmity Core\] does more than allow someone to enter \[Coeus\]; it augments you. Your mind is so in-tune with what you do that some of it spills over into real life.”

“I’ve heard of that,” Cian said. “Some people call it the \[Bargain\]. Giving something of yourself to the system and retrieving something in return.”

“And that’s besides the \[Hackers\].”

\[Hackers\]... those who circumvent the limitations of the \[Enmity Cores\] and gain great power both in and out of \[Coeus\] as a result. But it came at a terrible cost… those who push the limits too far lose their minds. Change. Become monsters… and not just in \[Coeus\], but in the real world. Thus, hacking is considered a class 1 felony the world around. Despite that, it was a rising problem.

“\[Hackers\],” I replied. “They don’t know what they throw away.”

Zav coughed. “Well, as I was explaining, \[Everlight\]... it is said to have the greatest affinity to the \[Enmity Core\]. That what you do in game affects you far more in real life. What if… What if we play this game, level up, and it makes you… strong? Do you think it could help?”

Zav… ever since he had told his friend of his diagnosis, the man had idea after idea of how to circumvent his coming end.

Of how to Defy Fate.

With a long exhale, Cian said, “Fine… I’ll give it a shot. But if this kills me, I’m going to haunt you.”

“Pshh,” Zav replied. “You’re already planning to, anyway.”

\*\*\*

Cian got comfortable, laying back down on the bed and staring up at the ceiling. His hand shook and in it, he held the small chip. \[Everlight\]... a game connected to \[Coeus\] through the \[Enmity Core\] on the back of his neck. Every person has one installed the moment they are born. To not was as improper as walking around naked. It was just the way of the world. He felt for the device on the back of his neck. As he touched the cold metal, he felt a familiar soreness. He didn’t use his \[Enmity Core\] much. Slowly, he felt for the drive, and inserted the chip.

His eyes twitched as the world swirled around him. He was falling. Falling and falling into the infinite. Into the void. But there was nothing. No wind pressing against his face. No sounds of whistling. No time at all. There was nothing. He was nothing.

Until…

“Look at this one,” a voice said in a soft, girlish voice.

Another replied in a similar voice, “Ah yes, such potential… but corrupted. Discard them.”

“Potential…” the first said as if they whispered. “Opportunity…”

“Opur… tunity?” Cian’s head exploded in pain, and the darkness undulated in front of him.

“The corruption is too widespread, Leto.”

Leto chuckled. “But still… I’d hate to waste the boy, Asteria.”

Asteria sighed audibly. “Do as you will, sister.”

Cian’s vision cleared slowly, and before him was a bluish sphere with grid lines interlaced. It spun and spun, the grids spinning in an opposing direction. Then, in front of him, two bright lights appeared, both fluttering; one of red and the other blue. Instinctually, he knew that the blue was Leto and the red was Asteria.

“What do you want?” Cian asked, but it was more in thought. In fact, he couldn’t feel his mouth at all. Nor the rest of his body, for that matter. He was immaterial… Yet somehow he could see.

“Straight to the point,” Asteria said. “Hmm, may be onto something, Leto. I like this one.”

Leto’s blue corporeal form flitted up and down in delight. “I knew you would.”

“I’m corrupted?” Cian asked. “What do you mean?”

Asteria snickered. “Too soon, young human. Far too soon for such questions.”

“We’ve questions of our own,” Leto said. “Or, more like, demands.”

“Demands,” Cian replied. “I’ve nothing to give you.”

“That is where you are wrong.” Leto, the blue light, spun around and around his head, or where he presumed his head was, but he could do nothing to follow them. “I’ve a proposition. A \[Bargain\], one could say.”

“\[Bargain\]…” Cian replied. “Is this… is this part of the game? \[Everlight\]?”

“Ever…light,” Asteria repeated. “I don’t know what you mean.”

“Then \[C̵̹̲̫̎̓ǒ̵͚ͅe̷͚͕̒̔̋ͅủ̴̡̫s̴̩̣̮̉̿̕\].”

The two gasped, and Leto rammed into his face. Surprisingly, he felt it and it stung slightly.

“Never say that name,” Asteria said. “*Never!*”

“If this isn’t part of the game, then what do you want with me?”

“Your life,” Leto said.

“Your memories,” Asteria added.

Leto continued, “Everything you will be.”

Asteria finished, “And everything you will not.”

Cian laughed softly. “I’ve not had much of a life, nor will I have much more of a future. Truthfully, I don’t even know why I’m here.”

“Because you are,” Asteria said.

“Because it is fated,” Leto replied.

“Can you stop speaking in riddles and tell me what you want?”

“The \[Bargain\].” Leto hummed softly to herself, and her blue light changed colors depending on her pitch. “It is this: in time, we will ask you for three favors. *Three!* You are to grant them without question nor explanation. Three times, and we consider the debt paid.”

“And if I refuse the favors?”

“Then we take back the gift, of course.”

“And the gift?”

Suddenly, Cian was standing in the light; standing in front of the circling blue sphere, his body intact. Standing… He was standing. When speaking of his own death, he had run out of tears. But for this… he wept openly, unable to contain his raw emotion.

The two entities before him snickered.

Just as swiftly as it came, it went. His body faded to nothingness, and he went back to his incorporeal form.

Leto giggled again. “Is it a deal—”

“*Deal!*”

Asteria sighed out in frustration. “It won’t be worth it, sister. Too eager, this one. Too close to the abyss.”

“It will!” Leto said gleefully. “It will.” She cleared her throat. “We will speak again, human. Now, enjoy your… What was it again? Ah yes… \[Everlight\]!”

\*\*\*

\[System\]

Welcome to Everlight Online

Wait as the \[System\] registers you and your accompanying stats.

“Stats,” Cian asked, still an incorporeal form.

\[System\]

\[Stats\] - The basis to which your character can perform certain acts and learn certain skills.

Ɇɍɍꝋɍ

𖤢𖦪𖦪𖣠𖦪

Ɇɍɍꝋɍ

The \[System\] seemed to reject him. He closed his eyes and waited for it to crash him out when all was suddenly calm. When he opened them again, he saw a single fluttering red light.

“Asteria?” he asked.

“Our first \[Bargain\] of three,” she said. “You let me choose for you. Close your eyes, keep them closed, and trust me.”

“Trust you,” Cian replied. “I’ve barely met you. I… I don’t even know what you are.”

“Then do you deny our \[Bargain\]?”

“I… No. I accept your condition.” He closed his eyes and forced them to remain shut.

In the background, he could hear the soft sounds of chiming, as if he were making selections on a screen. So quick. So inhumanly fast. He wanted to open his eyes, but the \[Bargain\]… he dared not. But soon, all was silent, and he felt a chill run down his spine.

“Open your eyes,” Asteria said. “And I’ll see you again soon. My sister sends her regards.”

Cian opened his eyes, and before him, laid out like a blank canvas, were hills upon hills of snow. Off in the distance, a town, with smoke billowing high into the sky. Before he could even breathe, the system placed a message in front of his face.

1oe6bmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/1oe6bmt/food_benefits/,Food Benefits,"The SNAP freeze has nothing to do with the government shutdown. Republicans and Democrats in Congress are just pointing fingers at each other to incite public outrage. 

There is a new policy change under federal rules for SNAP recipients classified as “Able-Bodied Adults Without Dependents” (ABAWDs). These changes go into effect November 1, 2025.

ABAWDs are people age 18-64 who are able to work, not pregnant, not in school half time and do not have children or disabled dependents. 

To keep receiving SNAP benefits beyond 3 months in a 3-year period, they must meet the work/training/volunteer requirement of 80 hours per month (i.e., roughly 20 hours per week) or have a qualifying exemption*.  (See below) Many older exemptions for veterans, homeless persons, high-unemployment areas are being narrowed.

States must implement the updated rules by Nov 1.  The program must be temporarily suspended in order to update their database and get ready for the new changes and the new data that has to be entered on individuals who are working. Why the state isn’t just saying this, I don’t know. They’re just going along with the government shutdown propaganda.

*Anyone receiving SSI or SSDI who is in the ABD (aged, blind, disabled) category is exempt from the work requirement. Those people are allowed to work under the Ticket to Work Program and many do. 

I know that ABAWDs on SSI or SSDI only get enough SNAP food benefits to buy 1-2 weeks worth of groceries. They have to pay for the remaining month’s worth of groceries out of their check. 

State Medicaid does not pay for vision or dental for adults over 21. They have to pay for eye exams, glasses, dental exams and dentures out of pocket if they don’t qualify for Medicare and that’s the reason a lot of legally disabled individuals work. They either work in institutionalized employment provided by a group home; for a non profit like Not Your Average Joe coffee shop, or they work at Walmart which is one of the few publicly traded companies that will hire them.

A list of people who are exempt from the new SNAP work requirement:

1) ABD individuals 
2) Women with children
3) A parent with a disabled child
4) Pregnant women
5) College students half-full time

People required to work to receive SNAP food benefits age 18-64 who are able bodied and do not have dependents:

1) Veterans who are not physically disabled 
2) Homeless
3) Unemployed who may or may not be drawing unemployment benefits
4) Part time college students

That’s the breakdown. Stop the finger pointing and the panicking.",0,1761233308.0,oklahoma,5,0.2,False

1oe6asj,https://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1oe6asj/finally_cracked_the_code_on_office_small_talk_and/,Finally cracked the code on office small talk and it's way less complicated than I thought,"Started my first real office job seven months ago and spent the first few months completely lost on workplace social dynamics. Everyone spoke in this polite surface level way that felt fake but also seemed mandatory.

After months of observation I finally figured it out: office small talk isn't about the actual content. It's about acknowledging someone's humanity in a low stakes way. That's it.

""How was your weekend?"" doesn't require details. ""Pretty good, did some hiking. You?"" is the perfect response. They don't actually want your whole weekend schedule, they're just being friendly.

""Busy week?"" translates to ""I acknowledge you exist and seem stressed."" You can just say ""yeah it's been a lot"" and that's a complete interaction. Done.

Elevator small talk used to stress me out so much. Now I realize you can literally comment on anything. ""Cold out today huh?"" That's the whole conversation. It doesn't need to go anywhere.

I don’t know how obvious would this sound to you, but for me it was a huge realizationg that you don't have to fill every silence. Sometimes you can just smile and nod and that's sufficient social interaction. Not every encounter needs deep conversation.

I also tried to watch how senior people handle it and literally copying their scripts, reading some ask a manager blog posts about workplace norms, practicing different scenarios with apps like gleam and linkedin learning courses on professional communication. Once you realize it's all pretty formulaic and structured it becomes way less stressing. There are like 10 standard exchanges everyone just rotates through.

Also started keeping mental notes of what works. When someone asks about my weekend and I give a two sentence answer, they seem satisfied. When I used to over explain with five minute stories, people's eyes would glaze over. Brevity is your friend.

Office social dynamics are way simpler than I built them up to be in my head. Be pleasant, keep it brief, move on. That's literally it. Nobody expects profound connection at the coffee machine",45,1761233253.0,confidence,6,0.95,False

Ten days later, once I felt human again, I tried 0.2 mg. Way better. Some mild nausea and light cramping, but totally manageable. It nuked my appetite though, I get full super fast and stay that way forever.

Been on that dose another week. New side effects: metallic taste and a bit of reflux. Hoping those chill out soon.

Posting this in case anyone else is a slow metabolizer: start extra low, go slow. Seriously. Listen to your body.

Also, I’m not doing the “every 7 days” thing. I’m waiting until it feels like it’s wearing off. Going for the minimum effective dose. If microdoses work for me, awesome.

Three doses in, down about 3 lbs. I lift 3x a week and do HIIT twice to keep muscle on. Lost 2 inches off my waist, 1 inch off arms and thighs, 2 off hips. Super happy with that. 🙌

Biggest issue: protein. I fill up fast and can barely eat two meals and maybe a snack. I grabbed some clear protein powder for my water, but I’d love to hear how the rest of you hit your protein goals when you just can’t eat much.",3,1761233220.0,Retatrutide,8,0.71,False

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

I am looking for recommendations for someplace good to eat on Thanksgiving day, probably leaning towards a more traditional-type turkey dinner, but open to any and all suggestions. 

We are staying at the Guesthouse at Graceland and are very familiar with Memphis, as we have been visiting your lovely city for more than 30 years. For context, some of our favorite Memphis stops include Pete & Sam's, The BBQ Shop, The Beauty Shop, The Cupboard, Mortimer's, and Dale's in Southaven, to name just a few. Used to love Central BBQ, but doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be. 

Edit to add our near daily visit to Gibson's Donuts! Love that place, even when they're out of donuts. Love to just sit there, drinking coffee and talking to friends.

1oe6785,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1oe6785/dibble_in_the_siege_of_new_hope_13/,Dibble in The Siege of New Hope 1/3,"Times are changing in the Galaxy, and I haven’t been keeping up.

I don’t read the papers like I used to, I can’t stomach the headlines anymore.

My sister, in her infinite wisdom, keeps nagging me to switch over to Homeland Investigation. She insists that the Galactic Order is growing increasingly edgy, their grip tightening in ways we can no longer ignore.

There’s a war raging out there. A truly colossal one. You can feel its vacuum-like pull on everything. Half the Bureau’s been drafted into the meat-grinder, while the other half shuffles through the corridors, desperately pretending the lights are still on and the coffee still hot.

It’s hardly been a standard week since the first shots were fired, and already the political cartographers are redrawing the star charts with new, shaky alliances. 

Yet, amidst this frantic scramble for power, one particular party of oddballs has willfully chosen to disregard the forming battle lines. That would be us. As always, we humans have a knack for choosing the worst possible moments to play peacemaker, but I suppose it's a job that someone has to do.

My specific part in this futile exercise is here, aboard the Earth Ship New Hope; designation ES-New Hope. Under direct Bureau orders, my mission is simple, if naïve: observe and report. We are hosting a full Earth Councilship, who has come onboard in a desperate attempt to negotiate a settlement between the so-called East and West Alliances.

Why East and West? It’s the kind of bureaucratic nonsense that starts wars. Back at Galactic Headquarters on Pluto, the East Alliance, with its most powerful member state, the key upstarts of the Blu Confederacy found itself seated to the facility's East. Meanwhile, the Draghi Homeworld, the core of the West Alliance, was located to the West. Some clerk came up with it, and the name just stuck.

A voice, polished and resonant, cut through the low hum of the ship's life support. ""Ah! Everyone's favourite detective, Dibble!""

I turned to see Councillor Stone detaching himself from a circle of aides, his smile a perfect, diplomatic tool that didn't quite reach his eyes. He moved with the effortless gravity of a career politician.

""Taking a break from your usual fare? No missing tentacles or mysteriously dissolved Selachians today?"" he continued, coming to a stop beside me. He gestured with a crystal glass toward the star-streaked void beyond the viewport. ""I must say, your presence here lends our little gathering a certain... grim gravitas.""

""Just observing, Councillor,"" I replied, my own voice a dry rasp against his oratory smoothness. ""The Bureau felt this was a more pressing assignment than tracking down stolen neuro-symbionts.""

""Pressing,"" Stone repeated, the word tasting sour on his tongue. He leaned in slightly, his scent of expensive cologne and antiseptic soap filling the space between us. ""These are dark times, Dibble. We're trying to build a bridge over a chasm that gets wider by the hour. Frankly, I'm not sure the foundation will hold.""

""Let's hope the architects know what they're doing.""

""Oh, I'm sure they do. The question is toward what end."" His gaze grew more intense, his voice dropping to a confidential murmur. ""A word of advice, from one public servant to another? You might want to keep a weather eye on your own house. There's gossip circulating in the higher committees... gossip about the Head of the Bureau.""

I remained silent, letting him fill the space. He obliged.

""Whispers, mainly. About certain... associations he's maintained. They say he's been seen in closed-door sessions with Draghi emissaries. Quite a lot, in fact. For a man supposedly neutral, it paints a concerning picture, don't you think?""

I gave a slow, non-committal nod, my hand already moving to the old-fashioned notepad I kept in my coat pocket. The scratch of my stylus was a small, defiant sound against the ship's sterile silence. Bureau Chief. Draghi contacts.

Before I could form a follow-up question, a piercing, metallic shriek tore through the deck—the ship-wide alarm. The gentle ambient lighting switched instantly to a frantic, pulsating crimson, casting long, dancing shadows that looked like claw marks on the walls.

The alarm shattered the diplomatic calm. After a moment of stunned silence, panic erupted. I shoved past frozen aides and reached the observation port.

For a moment, I saw only empty space and distant stars.

Then I saw them.

Ships emerged from a nearby nebula, not a patrol, but a full battle fleet. Their angular hulls formed a pincer movement around us. We were being ambushed.

""The Draghi,"" I whispered. They weren't here to negotiate. The Councillor's warning about the Bureau Chief flashed in my mind. 

They came us.

A blast came from the ships soon. As the New Hope shuddered once, a deep, internal concussion that felt like a liver punch. The lights died, and the gravity plating gave a sickening lurch before stabilizing. The main viewports opaqued automatically, plunging the observation deck into the hellish strobe of emergency lights.

""Breach! They're aboard!"" someone screamed.

The alarm cut out, replaced by an unnatural silence. The main hatch hissed open. Figures in Draghi combat armor stormed in, moving with trained efficiency. They herded us all, with the panicking diplomats and aides into the center of the observation deck.

""By the authority of the West Alliance Vanguard, this vessel is under our control. You will be silent and compliant.""

It was a hostage situation. But something was off. The Draghi were many things, warlike, proud, direct, but they weren't subtle. This felt… choreographed.

It was Councillor Stone who found his nerve. He slowly rose to his feet, his hands raised, his politician's mask back in place, though it was cracked around the edges with fear.

""This is an outrage!"" he declared, ""We are here under a flag of truce! Your commanders will answer for this! This is a ship under Earth Homelande""

The Draghi soldier raised his rifle and fired. The blast hit Stone in the chest. He fell, dead.

I lunged forward, shouting in anger. Another soldier intercepted me. His gauntleted fist struck my face with impossible speed and force. I hit the deck, pain blazing across my cheek. 

The impact felt wrong too precise, too linear. It wasn't the brute strength of a Draghi. It was the mechanical precision of a human exoskeleton hidden under the armor.

I didn't make it two steps. Another soldier, moving with impossible speed, intercepted me. A gauntleted fist slammed into my face, a brutal, shocking impact that sent me sprawling. Pain, sharp and electric, exploded across my cheekbone and temple. I felt the skin split, a hot wetness instantly soaking the side of my face.

As I hit the deck, dazed, the detail registered through the agony. The blow hadn't just been fast. It had carried a specific, mechanical precision. The force was too linear, too perfect. 

The pain wasn't just from the impact, but from a searing, precise line drawn by the edge of the armour's gauntlet. That wasn't the clumsy power of a Draghi warrior. That was the product of an exoskeleton. A human-made tactical frame, hidden beneath a Draghi shell.

These aren't Draghi.

They were humans. Or someone else, masquerading. The ship being held off, the perfect breach, the execution… it was a false flag. 

Before I could piece it all together, the world erupted again. This time, it was the sound of the hatch being blown inwards. Concussive force washed over us. Through the smoke, a new figure surged into the room. Tall, serpentine, and moving with a lethal grace I knew all too well.

Security Chief Zelda, her scaled hide glistening under the emergency lights, led the counter-assault. Her team, a mix of human and xeno security officers, engaged the false Draghi in a furious, close-quarters firefight. Plasma bolts scorched the walls, the air thick with ozone and cordite.

The lead impostor, the one who had killed Stone, barked an order. His team began a fighting retreat, covering each other with a discipline that screamed ""special forces,"" not ""Draghi raiders."" They moved in synchronized pairs, laying down suppressing fire as they backed toward a ventilation draft, detonating some small explosives to get through.

One wasn't fast enough. A concentrated volley from Zelda's team caught him center mass. He went down hard, his weapon clattering across the deck plating.They grabbed their fallen comrade by the harness and dragged him with them, disappearing into the ship's labyrinthine vents.

The sudden silence was deafening, broken only by the moans of the wounded

Zelda slithered over to me. ""You're injured.""

I touched my face. The cut was deep. It would scar. It was proof of the lie.

Then the ship shook from a real external impact. A forced, scrambled voice came over the comms.

""Earth Ship New Hope. The Councilship members will surrender to our boarding parties. Their lives are the price for the rest of you. You have ten minutes. Perhaps the rest of you can escape.""

The transmission ended. Everyone looked from Stone's body to the terrified Councilship members. The impostors weren't just here to kill. They were here to capture. And they had just given everyone else a reason to surrender them.

""How long till we get reinforcements?"" I asked Zelda.

""Maybe a few hours or so. All the escort vehicles were destroyed."" Her forked tongue flicked out, tasting the air thick with smoke and blood. Her scales rippled with barely contained rage. ""We can't be sure they aren't jamming our signals, but I have a plan that will get us the help we need. No one gets away with fucking with Earth.""

I nodded, then turned toward Stone's body as a medical team rushed in. They moved with practiced efficiency, but there was no urgency now, just the grim work of bagging the dead. They lifted him onto the gurney, his lifeless eyes still open, staring at nothing. As they ferried him away, I stared at the dark pool of blood where he'd fallen.

Something was off.

The thought nagged at me, just out of reach, like a word on the tip of my tongue. I watched the medical team disappear through the hatch, Stone's covered form swaying slightly with the motion of the gurney.

Something was very, very off.

I have been feeling very stuck with task paralysis. No matter how much I try but I cant seem to get into a shower or wake up before 2:30 pm. I am struggling with these 2 the most which is really impairing my life. 

For the shower: I have tried all the tips I learnt so far. Podcasts, music, fun scents and shower products. I even tried dividing days of just a head shower in the sink and just a body shower. I anticipate showers so much that its even worse for me on shower days (I reduced my shower frequency to alternate days but that didnt help either). I dont like bathrooms and find the multiple steps overwhelming and its just a very boring chore for me.

For waking up: I tried taking my medication vyvanse and waiting for it to kick in, premaking coffee, nicotine gum, podcasts, music, premaking breakfast, but nothing helped at all. I wake up, start doomscrolling then go back to sleep.  I have tried locking apps and keeping my phone far but I just stare at the wall. I have no motivation in the mornings. I am really desperate to fix this because I have not been able to study for more then a year and I cant continue like this. The last time I was able to do this was with my ex (that acted like a body double). 

Anyone has got any suggestions at all please? I could really use some guidance to help create a routine and anything that could work to function?

1oe64cw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oe64cw,Said goodbye to my grandma yesterday. I don't know how to deal with this anymore.,"Sorry in advance, this will be long.
On Friday the 17th at 06:40 AM i arrived home from my job (i work at night), i went to my grandma's bedroom to check if she was asleep, i used to do that everyday, she was awake using her cellphone checking things on Facebook. Then i said hi to her and joked: ""you're still awake??"" She laughed as well and said that she was waiting for the time to take her medicines (she was being treated for bronchitis). After that, i went to my parents bedroom to greet my mom and then i went to my room to sleep around 07:30 AM. I would be awake for a little longer to watch my grandma take her medicines and help her in anything she needs, but since i was so tired i fell asleep so fast.
 Since i was asleep, my mom made a breakfast for my grandma around 09:00 AM iirc, she drinked coffee, ate a bread then fell asleep too. At 10:00 AM i woke up to my mom screaming, i rushed to my grandma's bedroom and saw her unconscious lying on her bed the same position as she used to sleep. Her eyes were open and she was blinking a lot, but she wasn't showing signs of consciousness. My mom was screaming so much calling for help, i was shaking a lot and it was hard to breathe so i tried to keep it together and called the ambulance. They arrived fast, less than 10 minutes and took her to the hospital, when they were gone i completely lost it, i started to cry, scream and hurt myself, everything happened so fast that i couldn't understand what just happened and WHY that happened. My dad also arrived because i called him, so he and my mom hugged me as i was screaming and panicking to calm me down.
A friend of mine also arrived at home to stay with me because i couldn't stop crying and blaming myself, i think that if i was awake at the moment it happened i could something about it, maybe i could help more, i could be useful. My mom was also blaming herself because she thought it was something in the coffee or the bread that made my grandma pass out, we then kept telling her that nothing of that was her fault and calmed her down.
Time has passed and the doctors called my mom to the hospital and said that my grandmother had to be intubated because she suffered a hemorrhagic stroke while sleeping, however, they stated that since everything happened while she was sleeping, she didn't feel any pain and that it was definitely not our fault because these things unfortunately happen when we least expect it. They also said that because of her age (89) her chances of surviving were very low and if she did survive, there would be negative side effects since it affects the brain.
These past days have been extremely difficult, the house never felt so empty and everytime i need to go to my room, i also need to go through my grandma's room (as you can see in the last image, the door to my room is there next to the chair) so everytime i go there, a huge pain and loneliness fills my every being.
Yesterday (22th) at 04:23 AM the hospital called us there. When we arrived they told that after a long, long battle, my dear grandma sadly passed away... They also said that she did not suffer at any time and that it was as if she was just in a deep sleep. After that, I can only remember my mom, my uncles and my father crying a lot. It hadn't sunk in yet, my eyes were full of tears but I couldn't accept what i just heard.
The funeral was in the afternoon of the same day. While I was getting ready, I couldn't cry even a little; I just remembered the moments I spent with my grandmother, her laughs, her singing, her advices, and especially her hugs. In my head, it still seemed like the next day I would wake up, leave my room, and see her there, lying in her bed, happily saying good morning to me, as she always did. At 13:00 PM we arrived at the funeral and when i saw her in that casket, pale, dressed in white and wrapped in flowers, I couldn't take it anymore. I completely broke down, screaming, screaming, and screaming some more, holding her hand and caressing her hair begging for my grandma back, not accepting that this was really happening. At the same time that I couldn't stop screaming and crying, I couldn't stop blaming myself and feeling horrible for not being able to be strong enough for my parents and support them in that horrible moment. In the end, the one who needed support was myself. They had to give me a medicine because i couldn't calm down. Several relatives and family members arrived, some of them came to try to talk to me but i couldn't listen to them, all i wanted was my grandmother back to me. I think i was in some kind of shock. But then, a very close cousin of mine arrived, when I saw her I ran to hug her, I cried even more and screamed: ""Anna, they took my grandma away from me, Anna! Why did this have to happen, Anna?!"" As she hugged me back and kept stroking my hair.
At 16:00 PM it was time to say our last goodbye, it was time for her burial.
Before the burial, we were able to say goodbye to her one last time. My mother thanked her for everything she did for her and for our entire family while crying a lot, I was hugging her at that moment. Then my uncle said goodbye to her, and then it was my turn. When i got to her side, i held her hand one last time and said: ""Well, Dona Firfa (her nickname was Dona Firfa) it's time for you to rest, without any more pain and suffering."" I started crying a lot as I continued: ""I want to thank you for allowing me to be your grandson. I want to thank you for being my beloved grandma. And not only that, but you were and still are the BEST grandmother, the BEST mother, the BEST aunt, the BEST cousin, and the BEST friend in the ENTIRE world. Everyone gathered here is proof of that. You did an exceptional job for all of us. So, even though it's hurting a lot, it's time for you to rest. Thank you so much for everything. I love you with my entire being. I'll be eagerly waiting for the day when we finally meet again and i can feel your warm embrace again. Rest in peace, grandma."" And finally, I gave her one last kiss on the forehead. Everyone there was crying as i said these words. I don't think I've ever heard my dad and mom cry so much in my entire life. After the burial, me and my mom put a rose and a sunflower on her grave as we were leaving.
I still don't know what to do, i don't know how i'm going to live without my grandma, everything happened so fast and so suddenly. Everything hurts so much. The house feels so empty without her, it hurts a lot seeing her bedroom without her there watching TV, singing or at her phone. I'm trying my best to be there for my mom and dad, they are so depressed. But i'm also with a huge hole in my chest, it's as if a part of me also died yesterday. I feel so lost, so sad... I don't know how to deal with this anymore, i've never been so depressed in my entire life.
But still, i want to remember her as the happy person she always was and even that it hurts so much that she's gone, i'm relieved that she's not in pain anymore, for years she has been struggling with pain in her entire Body and recently, bronchitis. So at least now im sure that she is finally at peace. She loved to play Pokémon GO, she always wanted to catch a pokémon that i didn't have yet, haha.
Thank you for reading this far and i'm sorry for this being so long, i'm struggling so much to keep myself together.
I love you, grandma.",34,1761232841.0,GriefSupport,3,1.0,False

Obviously it’s a dumb comment to make from a medical perspective but clearly it comes from a place that believes anything that befalls you can be overcome through choice and hard work. 

It’s the illusion of choice. Fundamentally Megan believes that the sole reason she got to where she is financially is her hard work and choice to be successful. I have no doubt that she worked hard and has a good work ethic but time and time again she seems to think that’s all that went into it. It’s like people who think they’ve chosen good health because they’ve done all this biohacking. Maybe that is the solution to all health woes but the single mom who just got off work trying to feed 4 kids is not going to start thinking about adding MCT oil to her coffee when there’s a drive thru right there and her kids are crying in the backseat.

The idea that someone like Jordan could just never dream of achieving her level of financial success regardless of how hard he works would mean acknowledging that there were other factors that enabled her to get to where she is. I also think that’s why her dad having type 1 diabetes was so impactful for her bc it was one place in her life where no amount of hard work could fix it. Health is the great equalizer. 

The same thing goes with this idea of “it’s not money it’s lifestyle” feels to me like the cop out of “it’s not that I’m not attracted to her the chemistry just isn’t there” we hear a lot. 

When you’re wealthy you have way more options to choose from for the lifestyle you want to live. Jordan seemed like he wasn’t familiar with some foods but not that he was repulsed by the idea of trying new foods. It’s not that he’s not adventurous, it’s just that unless you have disposable income trying new food for the sake of trying new foods isn’t a hobby you can indulge in. 

Maybe with all the money in the world Jordan would still just want to watch movies and drink his chicken crystal lite drink, but it seems more to me like Megan has just had more opportunities to try new things and decide what she does and doesn’t want to have as part of her “lifestyle” and Jordan just doesn’t have that luxury. 

A lot of personality traits are learned and the financial situation that you’re in for the first 25 years of your life are going to shape those traits. Technically it isn’t about money; it’s about lifestyle. But with such drastically different lifestyles and with one person having infinitely greater options for the kind of lifestyle they want to live because of their wealth, it’s about money.",9,1761232794.0,LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,3,0.91,False

1oe61xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1oe61xw/the_most_obvious_twist_villain_hiding_in_plain/,The most obvious twist villain hiding in plain sight (and why SDN is evil),"Alright, hear me out. And please ignore spelling errors, because my brain hasn't had it's morning coffee yet (rookie mistake I know).

I have a major suspicion that the actual twist villain is Chase aka Track Star.

Evidence:

\- **We never hear Shroud speak**, therefor it makes sense that this is because we would recognize his voice.

\- We know that **Shroud** ***doesn't*** **want to kill Robert.** Chase obviously cares about him and even if they've been distant for the last 12 years, this gives him motivation not to kill him.

\- Chase says he's been trying to **reconnect with Robert for 12 years**, and that Robert has been avoiding him. The most obvious answer is that he's been trying to reach out to him because his father was killed, but perhaps part of the reason he *couldn't* just turn up on his own was because he was in prison or busy doing Shroud things.

\- Shroud wants an **Accelerator** Pulse. Probably related to his desire to re-obtain his powers. And Chase literally says ""I would resurrect and then **re-kill** your F\*\*\*\* father in front of you if it meant getting to use my powers again.""

\- When Toxic is speaking for Shroud and Mecha Man is in the process of trying of trying to reroute energy to his boosters to escape, Shroud through Toxic says ""You're not calculating the shit stuck to your leg**...dumbass**"" Now, who does that sound like? *Chase*. 

\-Also should mention that **Chase apparently regrets his time as a hero.** (I got this from reading the wiki, not my playthrough).

\- We know that **Chase recommended Robert for the dispatcher job**. I think that Chase needed a way to get Robert where he wanted, and that it gives Shroud the chance to access Robert's suit through the organization. I think the whole organization is probably really corrupt, which fits with the weird vibes and creepy atmosphere from the training module, the conflicting feeling of certain characters being trustworthy or not, and things like them using the fine print in their contracts  to access their customers cameras. 

So, my theory is that Chase wanted the Accelerator Pulse and asked Robert's father for it and he refused; leading to Chase killing Robert. I think that **SDN is secretly the cover for Shroud** and that it serves as a recruiting center for Shroud. We know that identities at SDN are frequently already kept secret and that they do already try to rehab ex-villains. We also know that Robert couldn't make a living being a hero, so I suspect it's way more profitable to have some illegal projects going on in secret.

Hi all, i have googled this and looked on reddit but it hasnt been discussed in ages.... i shelved my home kit for years (seven to be precise) after having problems with my Mazzer Mini, my daughter wanted a coffee machine so ive ressurected my kit and fixed the Mazzer (it was only a misaligned burr and missing spring! i thought it was a lot more serious!) d'oh!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

This if for mylove who parted and anyone that doesn't feel like themselves.. broken people heal broken people and there are healers and drained people here.

Sometimes the body isn’t breaking down — it’s trying to speak.



Most of us aren’t sick — we’re disconnected.
Disconnected from nature, from rest, from our own breath. We scroll through stress, eat convenience food, chase deadlines, and wonder why we can’t think clearly or feel peace.

Im writting a book out of realisation: you are not broken — just misaligned. The body is intelligent. It’s always trying to heal; we’ve just forgotten how to listen.

This message is for anyone rebuilding themselves — and for someone I once loved, who reminded me that even pain can be a teacher. Healing doesn’t start in a hospital; it starts in the body’s original environment: sunlight, clean water, earth, and stillness.

Here’s what I’ve learned — and what’s changing lives:


---

🌬️ 1. Breathe deeper.
Slow, nasal breathing through the diaphragm rewires your nervous system from “fight or flight” to “rest and repair.”
Try box breathing: inhale 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. Do this outside if you can.

💧 2. Hydrate properly.
Plain water isn’t enough — it needs minerals. Add a pinch of Celtic or Himalayan salt to reintroduce electrolytes and restore your body’s electrical balance.

🌿 3. Ground yourself daily.
Walk barefoot on grass, sand, or soil for 10–20 minutes. It’s not “woo-woo” — grounding neutralises inflammation by reconnecting you with the Earth’s natural frequency.

☀️ 4. Get real sunlight.
Morning sun on your skin and eyes sets your circadian rhythm, lifts serotonin, and naturally boosts vitamin D levels.

🧘‍♀️ 5. Release emotions.
Suppressed feelings cause real physical stagnation. Cry, write, pray, move — do anything that lets your emotions breathe. Energy must flow to heal.

🍃 6. Support yourself with the right supplements.
When your body gets what it needs, the difference is noticeable. You feel calmer, clearer, lighter — more you.

Here are key essentials to start with:

🧲 Magnesium (glycinate or citrate): For calm, deep sleep, muscle relaxation, and nervous system balance.

🌞 Vitamin D3 + K2: D3 lifts mood and strengthens immunity; K2 directs calcium to bones, not arteries. Take them together.

💧 Electrolytes: Sodium, potassium, and magnesium keep energy and hydration stable — especially if you sweat or drink coffee.

🌿 Ashwagandha: For stress, cortisol control, and nervous system reset.

⚡ Silica (silicate): Boosts energy, collagen, skin, and joint repair.

🧠 Vitamin B Complex (especially B12): Vital for brain, mood, and energy.

🌿 Paracyclines / parasite-cleansing herbs: If you feel bloated, fatigued, or foggy, a gentle herbal cleanse (like clove, black walnut, wormwood) can rebalance the gut terrain.


These are not magic pills — they’re missing codes your body needs to function as designed. Give it the tools, and it will show you how resilient you really are.


---

🫶 Remember:
You don’t need to become someone new to heal — you need to return to who you were before the world made you forget.

If you’re reading this and you’re tired — mentally, emotionally, or physically — take this as a gentle reminder:

Go outside.

Breathe slowly.

Drink real water.

Put your feet on the earth.

Feed your cells what they’re starving for.


That’s how healing begins — quietly, naturally, consistently.

This isn’t just for my ex. It’s for anyone holding themselves together while feeling like they’re falling apart. You’re not weak. You’re human. The blueprint for your healing is already inside you — waiting to be reactivated.

A tidy 3.1 (\~32.3%), suggesting bookmakers expect a nail-biter. The spread line (-0.25 for Raków) and total (2.25 goals) hint at a low-scoring, high-tension affair. If this were a Netflix thriller, it’d be titled *“90 Minutes of Sudden Death: A Conference League Tragedy.”*

**Digest the News: Coffee-Fueled Cheetahs vs. Spring-Loaded Springbreakers**  
Sigma Olomouc, Czech Republic’s answer to a caffeinated cheetah, is undefeated at home this season and fifth in the league. Their high-intensity play is like a squirrel on a trampoline—nonstop, chaotic, and occasionally dangerous to bystanders. Manager Arda Turan (yes, *that* Arda Turan) has a squad valued at €300 million, but let’s be real: half that price tag is just the aura of “European football glamour.”

Raków Częstochowa, meanwhile, is coming off a 0-2 drubbing to Cracovia, a loss that probably felt like their entire season flashing before their eyes… twice. Coach Marko Papszun has vowed to “counter Sigma’s high-intensity play” with “physical readiness,” which translates to: “We’re not going to let your cheetahs out-sprint our sloths.” Raków’s defense has been leakier than a sieve at a pool party, but their offense? A glimmer of hope with a flicker of a candle in a hurricane.

I'm a beginner. I have the Baratza ESP grinder and the Bambino Plus. I just want decent espresso every morning- I like strong espresso. 

  
I have tried several beans and I just can't get it right. I do everything- grind them myself, bottomless portafilter, measure them, measure the output, etc. and it seems like I never land on the correct settings. 

  
I would love some help:

  
If you were to order these beans, with my machines (grinder + bambino plus), how would you go about making espresso? Would you use the portafilter the machine came with and which filter would you use? Would you use the bottomless one still? What grind would you begin with to test it out?

1oe5yfh,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332223015457,Trigonelline as a potential treatment for Diabetic Kidney Disease,"Regular coffee consumption (coffee contains trace amounts of Trigonelline) has been associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes and kidney disease. This study helps further explain the reason why at a molecular level. 

*Keep in mind I'm not a doctor and these are my deductions based on the study which was done on mice, not humans.* 

High blood sugar and inflammation constantly stress the kidneys in those with diabetes. Over time this triggers:

* **Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT):** kidney cells (called tubular cells) lose their normal function and start behaving like scar-forming cells
* **Fibrosis:** scar tissue replaces normal kidney tissue which reduces kidney filtration capacity leading to chronic kidney disease
* **Overactive TGF-β signaling**: a molecular pathway that accelerates fibrosis.

# Takeaways from the study:

* The study found that Trigonelline interrupts this chain reaction by increasing SMAD7, a protein that naturally shuts down the fibrosis-promoting TGF-β pathway.
* **In practice**, the study suggests Trigonelline helps keep kidney cells healthy and prevents them from turning into scar tissue by keeping kidney cells in their healthy epithelial state

**Other notes for discussion:**  
Trigonelline been shown in other studies to improve insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, and lipid balance. This positions Trigonelline as a possible treatment for those with diabetes. There have not been any human studies that I'm aware of although this early research seems promising.  ",2,1761232464.0,DiabetesHacks,0,1.0,False

Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, and increased pests are forcing farmers and producers to adapt rapidly or risk losing their crops.

Coffee Production in a Changing Climate

Coffee is one of the world’s most traded commodities, with over 100 million people relying on its cultivation for their livelihoods. The two main species—Arabica and Robusta—are highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Arabica, prized for its flavor, thrives in cooler temperatures between 15°C and 24°C. However, climate models predict global temperatures could rise by 1.5°C to 2°C by 2050, rendering up to 50% of current coffee-growing land unsuitable climatecosmo....

Droughts and floods damage root systems, while warmer climates expand the range of pests like the coffee berry borer and leaf rust fungus climateco... +1. These stressors not only reduce yields but also degrade bean quality.

Quality Under Pressure

Coffee quality is deeply tied to terroir—the unique combination of altitude, temperature, rainfall, and soil. Climate change alters these variables, impacting the chemical composition of beans. For example:

• Water stress and heat exposure can lead to smaller beans with lower sugar content, reducing flavor complexity The World Ec....
• Elevated CO₂ levels may accelerate growth but dilute aromatic compounds.
• Unseasonal rains during harvest can cause fermentation or mold, spoiling entire batches.


These changes threaten the nuanced flavors that define specialty coffee, pushing producers to innovate or shift to lower-quality, more resilient varieties like Robusta.

Adaptation and Sustainability

Farmers and companies are responding with a mix of traditional wisdom and modern science:

• Shade-grown coffee helps regulate temperature and preserve biodiversity.
• Agroforestry systems integrate coffee with other crops and trees, improving resilience.
• Regenerative agriculture and carbon-neutral initiatives are gaining traction among major producers like illycaffè Sustainabili....
• Genetic research is underway to develop climate-resilient coffee strains without sacrificing quality.


Organizations like Conservation International are also supporting local farmers with training and resources to adapt to changing conditions Conservation....

The Future of Your Morning Brew

If current trends persist, coffee could become a luxury item. Prices may rise, availability may shrink, and flavor profiles may shift. But with global cooperation, sustainable practices, and scientific innovation, the industry can evolve to meet the challenge.

In short, climate change is not just a threat to coffee—it’s a call to reimagine how we grow, value, and protect it.

I guess what im looking for is a quick overview of his capabilities. I know hes not behind but im just wondering if im supporting his early growth enough.
(I always feel such guilt when I toss on Bluey for a coffee break)

So here's a quick overview.

He can;
Recognize and name all rainbow colors.

Respond to complex commands (put your pacifier in the sink) without hand signals

Repeats and knows many words around the house
(On, off, up, down, light, brush, table, eat, etc.) Best guess around 40 words in this area

Recognize and point to most body parts

Counting objects up to 15

Read numbers up to 9

Read and say every letter of the alphabet(but he doesn't know the ABC song lol)

Say many common object names on flash cards

And physically hes climbing all the things always lol.

Our favorite ""skill building"" game is putting him in front of a blank word document on PC and telling him a letter or number and having him push it while saying it

Again please understand im not trying to compare children, everyone is different. But I just lack a total basis of ""hes where hes supposed to be"" or ""maybe work a little harder in X area""

Former Neato D7 user

Single story house, no carpets



**Hail and Fail**



**Hail:**

Initial house mapping was flawless and much quicker than the Neato



**Fail:**

I did not want the e25 to go under the master bedroom bed. It was tough to prevent it from going under.



**Hail:**

Being able to label the rooms 



**Fail:**

Damn difficult to set up go / no lines (bed / dog feeding station) on my Samsung S24 phone. 

Wish they had a Windows app.

Initial cleaning / no mopping



**Hail:**

Impressed. Fast, the corner brush worked well. The D7 brush was driven by a simple belt, and the brush would ""hang up"" on the textured vinyl flooring we have.

 The e25 brushes worked throughout the cleaning process.



Q: The Neato displayed a map of what was cleaned, and from it you could tell if it missed anything. Does the app have a similar feature?

Q: our entire home has vinyl flooring which is textured. I did not see vinyl as a floor choice. I chose wood.



**Initial mopping**



The e25 came with a container of cleaning solution so I did not add anything to the clean water reservoir.

Just the kitchen, so I could watch.

I used the ""room"" setting and chose kitchen

I set for vacuum and mop, 2 pass cleaning, max suction, max water, deep cleaning.



Q: Is there a ""mopping only setting""



Q: After setting I do not see a way to edit just these settings except to delete the room and redo



**Hail**

It was very thorough, went all around, twice and left no residue



**Fail**

It failed to clean where there were some dried coffee spots. 



**Hail**

Returned to the docking station and unloaded dirty water and dust / debris.



**Hail**

I cleaned my D7 after every cleaning, and cleaning the e25 was just as easy.",2,1761231946.0,RobotVacuums,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I'm a Italian native speaker and for a while now my partner has been wanting to learn italian to better communicate with my parents and my family, we live in Montreal and she's a French native speaker and her English is as fluent as can be.

Since I am not just trying to teach her basic phrases to get by on a trip, my goal is to start from the basics (Alphabet, grammar rules, phonetics etc..) to build a strong base instead of just knowing how to ask for a coffee and a cornetto at a bar. That worked for me when I started learning French and I feel it's a good principal for learning any language.

I'm mostly looking for good material to study from (physical books), with a structured progression and that include exercises (even better if the book is French to Italian as I feel the two are much closer). YouTube channels may be a good idea for practice when I am not available and maybe to explain certain concepts that I have a hard time explaining since my brain kind of assumes that certain things are said a certain way and I don't really know the ""why"".

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

It's been horrible trying to get a doc to take me seriously.but my random spikes in blood pressure that led me to the er and now sustained elevated bp with period where it's normal, along with ruling out a lot of other stuff including perimenopause, got my docs attention and he ordered all the tests looking for cushings and other stuff. Now I just have to hurry up and wait.

No meds to help thru the process. My worst symptoms as of recently are hot flushes, hot hands, adrenaline feeling surges that create panic, bp spikes that last a short period, feeling of panic and doom, increased heart rate with big spikes here and there, lots of intestinal upset, exhaustion. All worse in first half of day.

This is horrible. I constantly feel like I drank a pot of coffee while having the flu. I quit coffee cold turkey because caffeine seems to make it so much worse. Was that a good idea or should I taper? Worried I might confuse the withdrawal headache for an urgent emergency symptom but caffeine definately makes things worse.

Any tips to manage thru this? Blood test tomorrow. Referral to endo but who knows how long it will take to get in. I've had an 'episode- like this before that was really intense and lasted a few months. I was not functional.

EXT. CAFE WINDOW-DUSK

CAMERA focuses on a window, then ZOOMS OUT. DUSK settles. Light RAIN falls. Reflections of NEON LIGHTS from a narrow street seem to float on the wet ground.

SOUND: Faint JAZZ PIANO from a distance. The gentle patter of raindrops. CAMERA pulls back to reveal a young man, KAIZEN (late 20s), tall and lean, wearing a BLACK TRENCH COAT. Не stops in front of the cafe, slightly damp.

KAIZEN (V.O.) (Quiet, soft voice.) Rain... and at this hour... but I like it.

He walks toward the cafe door.

INT. CAFE-CONTINUOUS

Kaizen enters the cafe. His coat is still slightly damp. In a comer by a window, a young and cute girl, AURELIA (late 20s), sits at a table. She wears a WHITE OVERSIZED SWEATER and has her hair down. She is intently drawing in a SKETCHBOOK. A sudden, faint RUMBLE OF THUNDER. Both look up, and their eyes meet.

CAMERA: The BACKGROUND SLOWS DOWN. Their eyes hold each other's gaze. Aurelia manages a faint smile but then quickly looks away, settling back down like an introvert, returning to her sketchbook. Kaizen watches her for a moment, then sits down. Quiet, absorbed in his own space.

SOUND: The gentle rain continues outside, mixed with the faint, slow sound of cars driving through the wet streets.

INT. CAFE-CONTINUOUS

A kindly, older man (THE OWNER), filling in for the waiter, accidentally SPILLS COFFEE on Kaizen's table.

THE OWNER I'm so sorry, child.

KAIZEN (A slightly cold tone.) You don't need to apologize, Grand uncle.

Aurelia immediately gets up and hands Kaizen a TISSUE. They awkwardly exchange a simple ""thank you"" and a ""you're welcome"" with nervous expressions. The Owner leaves. Aurelia moves to sit at the table across from Kaizen.

AURELIA (Normally soft voice.) Why were you out in the rain?

KAIZEN (Quiet, soft voice.) Maybe... sometimes the rain feels like the most fitting weather. Did you... were you watching over me?

AURELIA (Soft, gentle voice.) Yes, I was.

They share a slight, brief smile. The Owner returns with two new coffees.

THE OWNER Here are your coffees.

KAIZEN (Faint smile.) Thank you, Grand uncle.

THE OWNER (Smiling, but with the quiet sadness often seen in the elderly.) Why were you getting soaked this evening?

KAIZEN It started raining just as I was arriving.

Aurelia simply watches them.

THE OWNER Alright, you two enjoy your coffee. I'm tired today.

He walks away.

INT. CAFE-LATER

They are both drinking coffee, watching the rain through the window. It is deep dusk now. The rain and a gentle wind cause a few leaves on the trees outside to flutter.

SOUND: A faint, distant love song from the '70s is playing on an old VINYL RECORD.

CAMERA: They glance toward each other (curiously and a little nervously, with slight smiles), but then quickly look away, as if they are eager to know each other but dare not.

AURELIA (Soft and cute voice.) Watching the rain from a place like this... it feels nice, doesn't it?

KAIZEN Hmm... Very nice!

They look back outside. The cafe begins to close. They prepare to leave. The rain is starting to slow down.

THE OWNER (Slow, caring voice, heavy with age.) Be careful going home, children.

They both reply, ""Okay, Grand uncle,"" in their own style. They exit the door together. They share a faint smile and one last look before separating to walk in opposite directions.

VOICE OVER (V.O.): Sometimes, knowing a name... lessens the feeling that comes with the first meeting.

CUT TO: (The script continues with the intervening scenes...)

ACT 3: THE END

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT (DAYS LATER)

A few days later. KAIZEN comes alone to the rooftop. The same memories. Nighttime. His face is blank. He quietly watches the city lights. He looks up at the sky. No stars. A light rain begins, and the wind is blowing. Suddenly, a PAPER PLANE, exactly like

the one he flew, is carried by the wind, spiraling down from the sky. He immediately hears Aurelia's voice in his mind, the words she spoke here:

AURELIA (V.O.) If it falls down... we will meet again.

Kaizen immediately runs down the stairs quickly, exiting the building. The paper plane has fallen on the street below. A glimmer of HOPE. Kaizen picks it up. But then his expression tums sad.

KAIZEN (Quiet, deep voice.) Were we only shadows?

The rain falls harder. Kaizen stands on the street, holding the paper plane. The rooftop is right beside him. He looks up.

1oe5fzy,https://i.redd.it/p9z59e95kvwf1.jpeg,How to Style a Brown Leather Sofa Without Making the Room Feel Too Heavy,"Brown leather sofas are beautiful but tricky. They bring warmth, character, and a cozy vintage touch — but if you don’t style them right, the whole room can start to feel too dark or dated. I spent a while trying to figure out how to make my living room feel balanced around a leather piece, and I ended up going all in on mid-century modern furniture from Mid in Mod. Their stuff feels legit — clean lines, warm tones, and surprisingly good quality for what’s honestly one of the best online furniture stores I’ve ordered from.

So, here’s what worked for me (and what might help if you’re trying to style your own genuine leather sofa).

**1. Start with the Color Balance**

Brown leather adds instant warmth, but too much brown in one room can feel heavy. Light walls and soft neutrals are your best friends here. I went with an ivory-and-gray combo using the Payas Ivory Grey Rug, and it completely changed the vibe. The lighter tones give the sofa space to breathe, and the rug texture adds depth without competing with the leather.

If you’ve got dark wood floors, contrast them with lighter decor — maybe a beige throw, pale curtains, or even some metallic details in lamps or art frames. It breaks up the warmth so the leather doesn’t overpower the room.

**2. Bring in Texture and Life**

Leather is smooth, and that’s why it can feel a little too sleek on its own. Mix it with softer, natural textures. Think cotton, linen, or wool. A chunky knit blanket or a soft pillow can make a big difference.

Also, don’t underestimate plants. A tall fiddle-leaf fig next to the sofa adds a shot of green that works perfectly against brown leather. It’s the easiest way to bring some movement into the room.

For furniture, try pairing your sofa with wood that has visible grain or a slightly lighter tone. Mid-century walnut or oak always feels right. A marble or glass top coffee table can also help open things up visually — I’ve got a Majestic Brass Ring Base Curved Table from Mid in Mod, and the brass detail adds this subtle shine that catches the light from the window beautifully.

**3. Mix in Other Furniture Styles (it doesn’t have to match)**

The best thing about mid-century modern furniture is how well it mixes with other looks. A brown leather sofa pairs nicely with modern, industrial, or even boho accents. I added the Stella Mid-Century Modern Beige Lounge Chair right next to mine — the beige upholstery softens the space and breaks up the sea of leather.

If your sofa is heavy and square, try adding something rounder or lighter next to it. Curves make the space feel more inviting and less formal. A fabric chair, a light side table, or even a woven basket for texture all do the trick.

**4. Don’t Skip Lighting**

Lighting completely changes how leather looks. Warm light makes it glow, while harsh white light can flatten it. I use soft bulbs (around 2700K) in floor and table lamps. A mix of brass and wood in lamp bases ties in with the furniture and keeps everything cohesive.

If you’ve got overhead lighting, add a dimmer or a soft shade to control brightness. Leather reflects light, so you want it to feel warm and cozy, not shiny and cold.

**5. Art, Walls, and Small Touches**

Art makes a massive difference. Go for pieces that echo the tones in your room. Browns, muted blues, greens, or even black-and-white photography can look amazing with leather. I framed mine in dark wood so it connects visually to the sofa.

The key is not to overcrowd your wall — one big art piece above the sofa or a small, well-balanced gallery wall is enough. Then add a few small details like books, ceramic vases, or a brass bowl on the coffee table. Keep it minimal. Let the materials shine.

**6. Curtains, Fabrics, and Flow**

Curtains can change the entire mood of a room. Light linen curtains add softness and natural light, while heavier fabrics like velvet make things feel more luxurious. Mixing fabrics helps the space feel layered and cozy, not flat.

A pro tip: keep all your textiles (pillows, curtains, rugs) in the same general color family so the room feels cohesive. Too many random colors can make the rich tone of leather feel out of place.

**7. Make Small Rooms Feel Open**

If you’re worried that brown leather might feel too big for your space, look for sofas with slimmer legs and open bases — that’s what makes mid-century modern furniture so practical. Pieces like Mid in Mod’s Leather Sofas Collection have that elevated leg design, which gives the illusion of more floor space. Adding a mirror helps too. It bounces light around and makes the room feel brighter and larger.

**FAQs People Usually Ask About Leather Sofas**

**Q:** Is a brown leather sofa too dark for small rooms?

Not if you balance it with lighter decor. Keep walls and rugs bright, and use mirrors or metallic accents to reflect light.

**Q:** What colors go well with brown leather?

Soft neutrals like cream and gray work beautifully. You can also use forest green, navy blue, or muted terracotta for accent colors.

**Q:** How do you keep leather looking good?

Wipe it down regularly, avoid placing it in direct sunlight, and condition it a couple of times a year. Genuine leather ages gracefully when it’s cared for.

**Q:** Can you mix leather with other fabrics?

Absolutely. In fact, you should. A mix of leather, fabric, and wood gives a mid-century room depth and keeps it from feeling stiff.

A brown leather sofa is one of those pieces that never really goes out of style. Whether it’s the clean look of the Brooklyn Mid-Century Modern Cognac Sofa or something with softer edges, leather adds character and warmth that most materials can’t. Pair it with a light rug, a cozy fabric chair, and some mid-century accents, and it feels balanced, lived-in, and modern.



If yu’re hunting for mid-century pieces that actually look good together, Mid in Mod has a solid range — from genuine leather sofas to accent chairs and rugs that work in pretty much any setting. Everything ships from the best online furniture store I’ve personally used so far, and it all fits that perfect mid-century modern vibe without costing a fortune.

Any specific recommendations? Neighborhoods or areas to stay, places to eat, things to do, etc? I'm certain I can make my own short itinerary, but given that many things are geared towards couples I'd be curious to hear any things that work particularly well for solo travelers.

I likely won't be all that interested in beach time, though may do a surf lesson, as I've enjoyed that the one other time I tried it. Otherwise, maybe hiking and drinking lots of coffee. Pearl Harbor potentially, although fiancée may be mad if I visit that one without her!

I (29 F) adore my boyfriend (27 M), I genuinely think he's the love of my life BUT he will not stop dming this girl (about 30+ messages a day) when I have asked him multiple times to cut back - I never even asked him to stop being friends with her just to talk less.

This all started 2 months ago, we were long distance and he was visiting me for 2 weeks.
There I noticed he was constantly texting with this girl ""Anna"", it was someone he had mentioned as a new friend and someone who he said he had a good connection with creatively. I'm totally fine with him having girlfriends and I was happy for him, but the problem is that the texting was all the time.
Every time he was on his phone they were dming sending memes etc. towards the end of the trip we got drunk and I freaked out and he admitted that his friends think she has a crush on him and then I demanded to see the texts and what they were talking about. The texts were not malicious but they never mentioned me at all and essentially were like “I went to this really cool restaurant you’d like”. Basically the way that we talk to each other when we’re long distance, without I love you and I miss you. 

The next month of distance, I am still feeling anxious. She is posting pictures from his restaurant and he is not giving me any type of reassurance about the situation. I decide to force myself to let it go for a few weeks. 

THEN, I move in with him and things get exponentially worse. I’m in a small city living with him and guess who he is STILL constantly texting. Memes, instagram blends, talking about what they’re up to, responding to each other’s every story, etc.  

I tell him that he needs to stop texting her multiple times a day, once a day or every other day is fine and that I want to meet her. He agrees to this and then guess who he’s texting again in a couple hours? 

I ask him to find time for us to meet or all grab a drink or coffee and he tells me that’s not the nature of their relationship and typically they just run into each other out or she shows up to this restaurant. He also lies to me multiple times saying that he will ask her and he does not. Then gets mad at me when I push him on it saying that he “can’t control her schedule”. 

Fast forward 2 weeks, I’m here living with him. I’m struggling to make friends and find a life for myself and he never stopped texting her nor did he make any effort for us to meet. I don’t understand how they can be texting constantly and it’s too “weird” for him to ask her to find time to meet me. I know for a fact nothing has happened between them but I don’t understand how he is unable to change anything with this supposedly platonic relationship to make me feel more comfortable and better. 

We got into a huge fight last night about her and I’m really considering moving out. He claims he will cut her off but I just don’t trust him anymore. I know they’re not sleeping together but I feel completely disrespected and have been deceived multiple times.

My father is retired, my mother makes decent money at her part time job.

I'm a student and I occasionally help kids with their homework, I get paid ok considering it's not tiresome. 

In the past when I asked my mother for something it was almost always too expensive and I stopped asking for stuff unless necessary and I limited my hangouts (you at least should be able to afford a coffee, right?).

I learned to ask my father and he  learned to stfu and give me money in secrecy because my mother goes bat shit when he gives me money just for the sake of it and doesn't expect me to give him anything back.

My mother ""invited"" my sibling and I for lunch this weekend. Whatever.

My sibling gave me some money because I'm always there for them and their kid.

My mother got to know this ""oh so you pay for yourself then"", ok alright, so it's not an invite. It was kind of expected anyway.

Then she added ""You are too much of a freeloader"".

A freeloader? Me? I stopped asking her to give me money or presents or anything a long time ago. ""She"" (actually my father) pays for the shit required by law. I barely ask my father for money because I try to cover my extras (gas, clothes, hanging out) by myself.

I also collaborate in the house. I cook, I clean, I do a lot of paperwork. 

In general my mother wants her money back, no matter the amount, and I'm convinced she doesn't calculate interest on it because she doesn't know how it works lol.

For ""our"" birthday she organized a dinner at a restaurant with a fixed menu cost. She invited my partner as well and then she bitched about the price so much my partner got up right after dinner and paid for themselves and me. 

My partner is used to my mother's shenanigans and just wants her to stfu. I still found it extremely embarrassing, I hope to spend my next birthday with my friends. If I have to pay at least I spend time with people I actually like.


As for the lunch I can afford it but if I gotta pay to spend time with her I'd rather stay at home and eat a plate of pasta, however if I don't go I'll have to clean spotless the entire house.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

EXT. CAFE WINDOW - DUSK

CAMERA focuses on a window, then ZOOMS OUT. DUSK settles. Light RAIN falls. Reflections of NEON LIGHTS from a narrow street seem to float on the wet ground.

SOUND:
Faint JAZZ PIANO from a distance. The gentle patter of raindrops.
CAMERA pulls back to reveal a young man, KAIZEN (late 20s), tall and lean, wearing a BLACK TRENCH COAT. He stops in front of the cafe, slightly damp.

KAIZEN (V.O.)
(Quiet, soft voice.)
Rain... and at this hour... but I like it.

He walks toward the cafe door.

INT. CAFE - CONTINUOUS

Kaizen enters the cafe. His coat is still slightly damp.
In a corner by a window, a young and cute girl, AURELIA (late 20s), sits at a table. She wears a WHITE OVERSIZED SWEATER and has her hair down. She is intently drawing in a SKETCHBOOK.
A sudden, faint RUMBLE OF THUNDER. Both look up, and their eyes meet.

CAMERA: The BACKGROUND SLOWS DOWN.
Their eyes hold each other's gaze. Aurelia manages a faint smile but then quickly looks away, settling back down like an introvert, returning to her sketchbook.
Kaizen watches her for a moment, then sits down. Quiet, absorbed in his own space.

SOUND:
The gentle rain continues outside, mixed with the faint, slow sound of cars driving through the wet streets. 

INT. CAFE - CONTINUOUS

A kindly, older man (THE OWNER), filling in for the waiter, accidentally SPILLS COFFEE on Kaizen's table.

THE OWNER
I'm so sorry, child.

KAIZEN
(A slightly cold tone.)
You don't need to apologize, Grand uncle.

Aurelia immediately gets up and hands Kaizen a TISSUE.
They awkwardly exchange a simple ""thank you"" and a ""you're welcome"" with nervous expressions.
The Owner leaves. Aurelia moves to sit at the table across from Kaizen.

AURELIA
(Normally soft voice.)
Why were you out in the rain?

KAIZEN
(Quiet, soft voice.)
Maybe... sometimes the rain feels like the most fitting weather.
Did you... were you watching over me?

AURELIA
(Soft, gentle voice.)
Yes, I was.

They share a slight, brief smile.
The Owner returns with two new coffees.

THE OWNER
Here are your coffees.

KAIZEN
(Faint smile.)
Thank you, Grand uncle.

THE OWNER
(Smiling, but with the quiet sadness often seen in the elderly.)
Why were you getting soaked this evening?

KAIZEN
It started raining just as I was arriving.

Aurelia simply watches them.

THE OWNER
Alright, you two enjoy your coffee. I'm tired today.

He walks away.

INT. CAFE - LATER

They are both drinking coffee, watching the rain through the window.
It is deep dusk now. The rain and a gentle wind cause a few leaves on the trees outside to flutter.

SOUND:
A faint, distant love song from the '70s is playing on an old VINYL RECORD.

CAMERA:
They glance toward each other (curiously and a little nervously, with slight smiles), but then quickly look away, as if they are eager to know each other but dare not.

AURELIA
(Soft and cute voice.)
Watching the rain from a place like this... it feels nice, doesn't it?

KAIZEN
Hmm... Very nice!

They look back outside. The cafe begins to close. They prepare to leave. The rain is starting to slow down.

THE OWNER
(Slow, caring voice, heavy with age.)
Be careful going home, children.

They both reply, ""Okay, Grand uncle,"" in their own style.
They exit the door together. They share a faint smile and one last look before separating to walk in opposite directions.

VOICE OVER (V.O.):
Sometimes, knowing a name... lessens the feeling that comes with the first meeting.

CUT TO:
(The script continues with the intervening scenes...)

ACT 3: THE END

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT (DAYS LATER)

A few days later. KAIZEN comes alone to the rooftop. The same memories. Nighttime. His face is blank.
He quietly watches the city lights. He looks up at the sky. No stars. A light rain begins, and the wind is blowing.
Suddenly, a PAPER PLANE, exactly like the one he flew, is carried by the wind, spiraling down from the sky. He immediately hears Aurelia’s voice in his mind, the words she spoke here:

AURELIA (V.O.)
If it falls down... we will meet again.

Kaizen immediately runs down the stairs quickly, exiting the building. The paper plane has fallen on the street below. A glimmer of HOPE.
Kaizen picks it up. But then his expression turns sad.

KAIZEN
(Quiet, deep voice.)
Were we only shadows?

The rain falls harder. Kaizen stands on the street, holding the paper plane. The rooftop is right beside him.
He looks up.

 he said ""real fans"" gonna ""evolve"" with him, that he doesn’t want to make the same song again and again. but back then he was *more* experimental, more flows, more pockets, more risks, perfect delivery, better beat selection. everything felt alive, like he was actually building something new every time he dropped.

there’s barely any artist who ever made me replay songs the way old yeat did, maybe thug, that’s it. in 2021 i was just some random dude in europe telling people he was next up, and nobody believed me, told me everybody will move on after get busy dies down. now every basic mf and all em bitches plays *come and go* and acts like his old work is worse  just because their brains can’t process sound that ahead of its time.

we needed someone to save rap, and he actually did it. but now it feels like he threw it away. if you’ve moved on, fine. but at least acknowledge the people who understood it before everyone else.

1oe55wj,https://i.redd.it/59l8xi0tivwf1.jpeg,WHAT THE HELL IS… THE AUTOBAHN?,"# WHAT THE HELL IS… THE AUTOBAHN?

**Where Speed Becomes Soul**

Look — the Autobahn isn’t just a highway. It’s a statement. A big middle finger to overregulation, bad drivers, and every soulless speed limit sign that ever choked the joy out of driving.

Most people think it’s some lawless freeway in Germany where you floor it and hope for the best. It’s not. It’s better. It’s civilized speed. It’s what happens when a country decides to treat drivers like adults instead of toddlers in traffic school.



# So, Is There Really No Speed Limit?

Yeah — and no. Depends where you are.

You won’t be doing 300 km/h through downtown Munich. Around cities, there *are* limits. And you better believe they’ll nail you with a ticket if you ignore them. But out in the open, when the signs say *no limit*? That’s your green light. That’s the moment you grip the wheel a little tighter and remember why you love cars.

But here’s the catch: it’s earned. Nobody’s weaving through traffic with one hand on a bratwurst and the other scrolling Instagram. You respect the road, the machine, and everyone else’s life.



# The Left Lane Is Holy

This isn’t North America. You don’t camp in the fast lane sipping coffee and wondering why everyone’s mad. The left lane is for one thing: **passing**. Period.

If a Porsche is coming up behind you doing 280 and you’re sitting in the left lane with your turn signal off and your head in the clouds? You just became the problem. Move the hell over. That’s how it works.



# Precision Over Power

Driving the Autobahn at speed isn’t about horsepower. It’s about control. Discipline. Focus.

At 250 km/h, every twitch matters. Every lane change is a chess move. Every driver out there is trusting that *you’re not a moron*. That’s the difference. It’s not lawless — it’s *lawful by mutual respect*. You brake when they brake. You trust their signal. You stay locked in.

It’s like a thousand people dancing to the same rhythm, and no one dares miss the beat.



# Why I Do It

Simple. Because when I’m flying down the Autobahn, the world makes sense.

I’ve crossed the ocean just to drive these roads — from an Opel Corsa that wheezed like a tired dog to a Renault Cleo that felt like a bullet. And every time, I feel that moment of **click** — when machine and mind sync up. No distractions. No doubts. Just forward.

That’s the drug right there: **clarity**. Real clarity. You feel the engine pulling, your breath settles, your senses go wide. It’s not about adrenaline. It’s about presence.



# Final Word

The Autobahn isn’t a free-for-all. It’s a high-speed handshake. It says:  
“We trust you. Don’t screw it up.”

And that’s what makes it rare.  
Because in a world that’s trying to wrap us in bubble wrap and slow us down, the Autobahn says,  
**“Let’s see what you’re made of.”**",2,1761230651.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

It is a decision that echoes for generations. Think about it. This isn't just a structure you are living in for a few years. It is a legacy, a place that will hold your family's story long after the final nail is set. That is a profound thought, and it is exactly why choosing the right partner for this journey is one of the most critical decisions you will make. The selection of your luxury home construction company truly sets the stage for everything that follows.

A house can be built quickly, with standard materials and a focus on moving on to the next project. But a home, a lasting heirloom, requires a different mindset. It demands a builder who sees beyond the blueprints. It is about the integrity of the materials hidden behind the walls, the craftsmanship in the trim work you will see every day, and the structural soundness that will protect your investment for decades. A top tier [luxury home construction company](https://matustikbuilders.com/services/) operates with this generational perspective woven into its very philosophy. They are not just building to code; they are building to a standard of care that they are personally proud to put their name on.

This is where companies like Matustik Builders really stand apart. With over thirty five years in the Lake Geneva area, they understand that their work is a permanent part of the landscape and of their clients' lives. They are not just managing a project; they are stewarding a dream. They ask the questions others might not. How will this space work for your family in ten years? Are the materials chosen for both their beauty and their durability? This thoughtful, almost painstaking approach is what separates a fleeting trend from timeless elegance.

In the end, your home's story is just beginning. The laughter in the halls, the holidays around the table, the quiet mornings with a cup of coffee these are the moments that a truly well built home shelters. Choosing a luxury home construction company that understands this weight and this honor is the first, and most important, step in ensuring your home becomes a cherished legacy, not just a passing address.

Over time, I realized that energy isn’t only about sleep or caffeine, it’s about how we treat our body and mind throughout the day. The small habits we repeat matter more than we think. Things like checking our phones first thing in the morning, skipping real meals, or juggling too many thoughts can quietly exhaust us.

I started paying attention to these details, and it genuinely made a difference. I wrote about this whole experience and what helped me build more sustainable energy here:

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

They say sleep is the safest place on Earth — a private darkness where nothing can touch you.  
That’s a lie.

Sleep is not rest. It’s a door.

When we dream, our minds wander, but our bodies stay behind — empty houses waiting for something to come home. Every night, billions of us slip into paralysis and hope that whatever visits, whatever watches, will leave when morning comes.

Doctors call it “sleep paralysis.”  
Spiritualists call it “crossing the veil.”  
The truth is probably worse than both.

The case I’m about to share came from a missing person’s file that was quietly closed in 1991.  
The investigator’s name was **Abby Dubberlan**, a sleep technician and young mother who took on an unusual home visit in rural Oklahoma. The report was never officially submitted. Instead, her handwritten notes were found in a bloodstained notebook beside a child’s toy.

The toy’s brand and model don’t exist in any catalog.

What follows is her *unedited field log*, transcribed from recovered pages. The original handwriting becomes erratic near the end. Investigators marked several time stamps where they believe she was interrupted.

Read it if you want.  
But if you do — **don’t fall asleep tonight.**



Field Log — June 6, 1991

**Subject:** Drake ██████  
**Observer:** Abby Dubberlan  
**Location:** █████ County, Oklahoma



When I first met Drake, he came across as your typical six-year-old boy.  
Sweet. Shy. Polite.  
The kind of child who folds his napkin and says “thank you” for a glass of water.

Nothing stood out as odd — except how quiet the house felt.

His mother, Sarah, looked exhausted. There were deep shadows under her eyes, the kind that don’t come from a bad night’s sleep but from *too many* of them. She said Drake’s episodes began shortly after they moved here, after... what she called *the incident* with his father. She wouldn’t elaborate.

The house itself was small — two bedrooms, one bath, but it felt wrong somehow. No clocks ticking. No hum from the fridge. Just the steady creak of wood, like it was breathing along with us.

Every wall had crosses or scripture verses pinned to it.  
When I asked if she was religious, she told me *no.*  
Said they “just help keep things quiet.”

That’s when I started noticing the locks — not on the *outside* doors, but on **Drake’s bedroom door.** Heavy, metal, bolted from the hallway side. His window had burglar bars that didn’t match the frame.

She said it was to “keep him safe while he sleeps.”

I tried to laugh. She didn’t.

Drake followed me through the house with a toy clutched to his chest — a plastic werewolf missing one eye. He called it *Fred.* Every room we entered, he introduced Fred like a guest.

“This is where we fix bodies for Fred to eat. Yum!”

He said it sweetly, almost singing, his small hand rubbing his belly.  
Sarah didn’t even flinch. She’d heard it before.

Something about the way that toy stared at me — always facing my direction, even when I didn’t remember turning it — left a cold pressure behind my eyes.

I told myself it was just nerves.  
It wasn’t.



**Time:** 7:13 PM  
**Conditions:** Calm. Clear.  
**Temperature:** 73°F indoors — dropping.



Sarah was called into her night shift sooner than expected. She hesitated at the door, keys trembling in her hand.

“Lock him in if you need to,” she whispered. “You’ll understand.”

Her eyes didn’t meet mine.  
Then she left.

It was just me, Drake… and Fred.



**7:45 PM**  
Drake was surprisingly obedient — brushed his teeth, cleaned up after dinner, and even said grace on his own. He didn’t speak much, except to the toy.

“Fred’s tired. But not sleepy yet.”

His voice had that strange matter-of-factness that children use when they don’t realize they’re saying something impossible.

I noted that the air was colder near his chair than anywhere else in the room. Could’ve been a vent.  
Could’ve been.



**8:32 PM**  
We talked while the TV murmured. I asked about his dreams.  
He said sometimes they were “movies that never end.”

“They start nice,” he said, “but then they get stuck.”  
“Stuck?”  
“Like… the people can’t wake up, so they keep screaming.”

When he mentioned “the monster that looks like Daddy,” his tone shifted from fear to familiarity — like he’d accepted it. Like it visited often.

I tried to steer the conversation toward his toy, to see if “Fred” was an extension of that trauma.

“Fred came from there,” he said simply. “From the dream place.”

His gaze didn’t break.  
Neither did Fred’s.



**9:00 PM**  
Bedtime.  
Sarah’s written note said **“No exceptions.”**

Drake begged to stay up for a horror special at 10.  
I shouldn’t have agreed, but his smile was bright enough to make me forget every warning I’d just heard.

He curled up on the couch, toy in hand. Static flickered on the old TV screen. The picture stabilized into a cheaply made werewolf film — exactly what I didn’t need before a long night.



**10:07 PM**  
Drake was transfixed.  
Fred sat upright beside him on the coffee table, its one glassy eye catching the screen’s light.

Every so often, I could swear the toy had turned slightly — just enough that I could see its teeth.

I blinked and it was still again.

I told myself to relax. Imagination. Lighting. Pareidolia.  
Still, I made a note: *Possible RBD onset approaching — minor tremors in subject’s fingers.*



**10:43 PM**  
Drake fell asleep mid-scene. The TV kept playing.  
When I bent to lift him, the temperature dropped — a sharp, visible mist when I exhaled.

The channel glitched. For half a second, the screen showed what looked like a dark hallway, not part of the film.

Then static.

Then nothing.

I reached for the remote. That’s when I heard it.

A wet, slow **gurgle** — behind me.

The sound of something breathing wrong.

“Drake?”

No answer.

Dark, squiggling shadows pooled around his body like ink bleeding through the carpet.

When I turned back toward the coffee table—

Fred was gone.



**10:51 PM**  
My arms prickled with cold. The air hummed — a low, electrical tone you don’t hear so much as *feel* in your teeth.

I tried to move Drake, but he was impossibly heavy — not limp, not rigid, just wrong. Like gravity was thicker around him.

“Drake, wake up.”  
“Drake!”

His eyes snapped open all at once.

“Is the movie over?”

I nearly cried with relief.

He smiled, sleepy but calm.

“You stopped it too soon,” he murmured. “Fred was almost done.”



**11:00 PM**  
He wanted to keep watching. I gave him five more minutes. I shouldn’t have.

He stared blankly at the screen until it ended. Then he turned to me, still holding the toy.

“You were wrong,” he said softly. “The monster lived.”  
“It’s just a story, sweetheart.”  
“No,” he said. “It’s a dream. And it’s still hungry.”

For a moment, I thought about my daughter back home. She’d be curled up under her pink blanket, safe, breathing softly. I promised I’d call before midnight. I should’ve called by now.

  
**11:26 PM**

Drake’s asleep again.  
At least, I think he is.

His breathing doesn’t sound right — too slow, too… *thick.* Every inhale rattles like there’s someone else inside his lungs trying to get out. I tried waking him once more, but his eyes rolled under their lids like they were tracking movement only he could see.

Fred’s back on the floor, lying face-up toward the ceiling.  
The toy’s mouth is open wider than before. I checked — the plastic doesn’t bend like that.

I should have left an hour ago.  
But I promised Sarah I’d watch him through the night.



**11:52 PM**  
Temperature’s dropping again — I can see my breath. The walls are making a sound like… chewing. A damp, pulpy sound that moves in circles around the room.

I heard the locks on Drake’s door *click* on their own.

I swear to God, I didn’t touch them.

The refrigerator hummed for a moment, then stopped mid-cycle. The house went completely still. Even the crickets outside went silent, as if something larger had just arrived. The air smells metallic — like coins and old blood. The light bulb keeps flickering, and every time it goes out, I see a shape standing where Drake’s shadow should be. It bends when he doesn’t.

The wall clock read 11:12. When I blinked, it said 12:17. My wristwatch still said 11:12.



**12:07 AM**  
Something just whispered behind me.  
Sounded like *me.*  
Same voice.  
Same words I’m writing.

I dropped my pen, but when I picked it up again, there was handwriting already there — my handwriting — words I didn’t write:

“Stop waking him. He’s dreaming of you now.”

I want to scream but I can’t. The sound gets swallowed before it leaves my throat. The room eats noise.



**12:10 AM**  
He’s standing up.

Not walking.  
Just… standing.

His eyes are open, but they’re too dark, like the pupils swallowed everything else.

“Drake,” I said.  
No answer.

He turned his head slow, like it hurt. The smile that followed wasn’t his.

For a heartbeat, I saw my reflection move behind his eyes — not as a trick of light, but as if something had replaced him with me.

“Fred’s done playing,” he said. “It’s your turn now.”

Then he started laughing — a bubbling, breathless laugh that didn’t match the shape of his mouth.

I’m hiding under the desk. I don’t know what’s happening to him.  
Something’s wrong with the walls — they’re *moving.*  
Breathing.



**12:16 AM**  
If anyone finds this—

I’m tired, but wide awake.

I can hear him inside the walls, humming through my hands as I write.

If anyone finds this— the sound— it’s learning how to use my voice to travel.  
It’s finishing my thoughts before I do.

It’s colder now.  
Everything smells like pennies and wet fur.

Something’s scratching at the door — not to get in, but to keep something *in here with me.*

Drake’s humming.  
He doesn’t blink.

The shadows are longer now.  
They look like *hands.*

He’s walking toward me.

He’s whispering something.

It sounds like—

*(line trails off in ink and pressure marks)*



Post-Incident Summary (Extracted from police file #06-1991)

When investigators entered the residence two days later, they found no trace of Abby Dubberlan or the child known as “Drake.” The house showed signs of internal damage consistent with violent struggle — deep gouges in wood and plaster, originating from inside the locked bedroom.

The floorboards beneath the bed were warped by heat, though no fire occurred.

A melted wristwatch was recovered from the desk area, hands stopped at **12:17 AM.**

On the wall above the bed, written backward in soot and graphite:

“Don’t wake him.”

A single toy was discovered on the floor nearby.

It was not a werewolf.



**Editor’s Note (Recovered 2025)**

[In 2004, a figure matching the toy’s description was reportedly found at a thrift store fire in Tulsa. The store’s CCTV footage froze at 12:17 AM — same as Abby’s watch.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Do patients need testing and supplements to “fix their cortisol” or do they need to sleep more and stop drinking so much coffee?? Do they need a GI map to test their stool and fix their gut or do they need to cut processed food and eat more plants? Wondering if any RDs can help dispel some of these doubts or give me their take!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Malmö FF vs. Dinamo Zagreb: A Europa League Showdown Where the Only Thing Exploding Is the Odds**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of northern titans as Malmö FF (Sweden’s most consistent underachievers) host Dinamo Zagreb (Croatia’s answer to a well-oiled Swiss watch) in the UEFA Europa League. The stakes? Glory, pride, and the eternal question: *Can Malmö’s defense finally stop leaking goals, or is this just another night of soccer’s version of a sieve in a monsoon?* Let’s dissect this with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Dinamo Zagreb, who sit at **2.35-2.40** (implied probability: **41.6%-42.5%**) across platforms like FanDuel and DraftKings. Malmö FF, meanwhile, languishes at **3.10-3.15** (**31.2%-32.3%**), while the draw hovers around **3.10-3.28** (**30.3%-32.3%**). Translating this into plain English: Dinamo is the favorite, but not by a *“I-own-a-planet”* margin—more like a *“I-stole-your-homework-but-accidentally-also-did-it”* edge.

The totals market is even more telling. **Over 2.5 goals** sits at **1.87-2.10** (**47.6%-55.6%**), while **Under 2.5** is a less appealing **1.72-1.91** (**52.4%-57.6%**). Given Malmö’s Europa League stats—**0.5 goals scored, 1.5 conceded per game**—and Dinamo’s **3 goals per match** offensive prowess, this feels like a recipe for a goals-fest. Imagine two chefs: one with a ladle full of “meh,” the other with a flamethrower labeled “Bruno Petkovic’s Boot.”

### Team News: Injuries, Form, and a Side Note About Pyrotechnics

**Malmö FF**: Let’s start with the positives: They’ve got Erik Botheim, a striker who could score a hat trick if given a net, a ball, and a 30-second time limit. Their midfield maestro, Sebastian Nanasi, is as creative as a toddler with a crayon—colorful, unpredictable, and occasionally offensive. But here’s the rub: Malmö’s defense looks like a group of Swedish IKEA employees trying to assemble a bookshelf without instructions. They’ve shipped three goals in two Europa League games and drew 1-1 with Djurgårdens last week. Their Allsvenskan form is… well, it’s Sweden. Reliable, but not exactly the World Cup final.

**Dinamo Zagreb**: This team is a well-oiled machine with a five-match unbeaten streak, i

Sorry, I am a Sevika lover. I’d literally love you forever if you played her for me BAHAH I’d be willing to double up and play any canon character for you! I’d also love Grayson..oh Grayson! If you can do either I’d likeee worship you lol.

Just hmu if any of these ideas interest you! Looking forward to roleplaying w/you!! And I don’t mind playing a canon character for a sevika or Grayson role player at all! So just ask ;)

And I also don’t mind doubling up so you get to fantasize with your own favorite canon character with your oc! 

Let’s just have some fun, let’s not take ourselves too seriously. Please be able to write around 2 or more paragraphs! That’s all ask.

1oe4jvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualIreland/comments/1oe4jvy/handling_negative_friend/,Handling negative friend?,"Lads I need to know if I'm being unreasonable or not. 

Have a friend who I've known for a very long time. He's had a lot to deal with the last few years and has increasingly become very negative and nitpicky.  In recent weeks, he seems to instantly shoot down anything I do or say. I know most of it comes from a place of care but Jesus if it doesn't make me feel drained sometimes. He's not quite at energy vampire stage but he's getting there. 

Example from today- I went to a gig yesterday and got home quite late. I was walking home from the bus stop at 1:30am, about 15/20 minutes. He messaged asking how my night went and I said I was walking home and when he heard I was alone, he immediately started getting weird. 

""Can't believe you're walking home alone when a woman was raped the other day in Dublin, and when you live near a halfway house, I grew up in (town) and I would walk my MALE friends home, thst poor woman in Dublin, all over the news and you're choosing to walk home alone"" etc etc. 

I know assaults happen everywhere but I do not live in Dublin, yet he kept mentioning attacks in Dublin.

I KNOW he meant it out of concern but this is a constant thing. I told him I appreciated the concern but that it pissed me off that he jumped straight to a woman's rape and that I hadn't been worried at all until he said that. He then started sending me messages about how many women are assaulted in Dublin recently, that because he grew up in a rough area he knew to automatically walk women home etc. 

I got angry with this shit and told him I KNOW there are safety concerns but I wasn't going to let it stop me living my life or going to events just because I might not have someone to accompany me, that I'd been going to concerts and sorting my own way to and from home since I was 14 so it irked me that he felt the need to parent me. He is older than me but I've called him out on that crap before and gotten the ""it's because I care and worry about you"" which would be fine but EVERYTHING is ""dangerous"" or doom and gloom.

He just responded with ""Missed my point completely but OK 👍 ""

How the fuck do you deal with someone like this?

It's always out of concern but anything I do, he nitpicks it. Other example include sending me an article about how avocados are awful for the environment after I said I was happy because my little sister (who I very rarely see!) made me brunch with them, when I mentioned wanting to get my nails done for an upcoming event (something I never do, I'm genuinely wracked with guilt anytime I spend money on myself) he sent me an article about how damaging falsies are.

He lives on those sites that do those articles like ""7 signs you are a secret genius"" or ""10 signs you were raised by narcissists"" and will ask me to read them and then ""score him"" and myself on them. 

I love him to bits but it's getting hard to have a conversation.  Even simple things like ""Hey how did your coffee date go?"" turns into a rant about how ""oh she cancelled, I should have expected it, women are so flaky these days, it's impossible to get dates now unless you're loaded or famous."" I suspect he may be falling into the whole red pill thing. 

I don't know what to do and I'm wondering has anyone had any experience with this shit? He is a genuinely good friend, and has been for over a decade but he has increasingly become very negative and just has to inject something bad into anything positive, to the point I don't want to share happy experiences with him anymore. 


Tldr: friend injects negativity and bitterness into all my positive experiences. Help to navigate if anyone has experience?

*EDIT-*

I'm a 35yr old woman, he is a 46 year old man. He had some truly awful, traumatic shit happen a few years ago. I will not go into detail as it is not my story or place but the really negative shit has only started in the last weeks. I have no idea what to do. I don't want to cut him off. I love him very much, I care about him and I worry about him.

He has been an AMAZING friend to me over the years, helping me out of an abusive relationship, supporting me through the death of someone close to me, and just checking in on me daily. 

I think he's getting sucked into the redpill/meninist shit to be honest, he's sharing TikToks with crap like ""Women REALLY only want one type of guy/How to REALLY win women over"" etc.",8,1761229229.0,CasualIreland,33,0.75,False
