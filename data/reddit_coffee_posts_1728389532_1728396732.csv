It seems it would be good to start with a mason jar & possibly brewing bags.

First for the coffee, can I just use the coarse setting on the grinder at my grocery store? Will this be coarse enough? I think their grinder has one setting coarser than french press. Note I've never used a coffee grinder before.

I'm thinking about getting a pair of 32oz mason jars and pack of 100 4x6 cold brew filter bags. Then, start with something like 5oz of coffee to 25oz of water, and steep for 16-24 hours. This should give me a 1:1 ratio of concentrate to water. 

Does this sound like I'm on the right track?",1,1728396650.0,coldbrew,0,1.0,False
1fz0pui,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1fz0pui/my_stepmom_doesnt_respect_me_as_much_because_i/,My stepmom doesn’t respect me as much because I don’t have kids,"I’m 36, an attorney, happily married with 3 dogs and 1 cat. We have lots of fun hobbies and our schedules are always full with events, travel, spending time with friends, or whatever else we feel like doing. My dad completely respects and supports my decision to not have kids. His wife, however, definitely treats me differently than her kids(or their partners). Her kids have 2-4 kids each and she talks about them like they’re so responsible and “adult”. Even though her son is an alcoholic and divorced. Her daughter, my stepsister, is a great person but she’s certainly not without some chaos. She has two kids with two different men. Not trying to shame her for that but I feel it’s relevant. 

My step mom still treats me like an irresponsible child and talks down to me sometimes. If we disagree on anything she talks over me and pulls the “I’m older and therefore wiser” card. I brushed it off in the beginning because I was 24 when they met and I WAS young and irresponsible. I remember at one point when I was 24 she told me I couldn’t move away because I had to stay here and “make babies.” 

Anyway, now I’m 36 and my life is very stable and she still treats me like this. I always try to do things to try to show that I am responsible by helping take care of their boat when they leave town or bring them treats from the city or send them things they need like a new coffee pot or knife set. She doesn’t treat her kids or their partners like this though and I feel like it’s because they have kids so they automatically get more respect.

I used it for the first time, and the inside still smells like coffee 

I tried filling it with hot water and dish soap, and shaking it around letting it sit for awhile. I did that a couple times.

1fz0mo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1fz0mo8/update_coworker_at_bfs_30m_work_wants_to_sleep/,Update: Coworker at BF’s (30M) work wants to sleep with him…he says that if I (23F) would treat him right she wouldn’t want to,"
On Sunday this week he found my Reddit post, and was quite offended about all the comments talking about how awful he was. He said that if I really believe all the comments then I know where the doors are in the house and to leave, and asked why I keep on staying. I told him because I honestly think that I’m the problem and if I act right things would get better. I also told him that he’s been calling me childish more than he’s complimented me so it’s broken me down. He also said it was a very one sided story…brought up the whole water thing and said “tell Reddit how much water you were drinking a day along with your energy drinks and how you always deflect during arguments.” He said that he sent it to his friends and they all agreed it was very one sided. 

I would drink a 32 oz tumbler of water at work with an energy drink a day, then come home and drink water with dinner and throughout the rest of the evening. I know energy drinks aren’t healthy for you, but coffee messes with my stomach too much to drink during work, that’s the only reason why I have drank energy drinks. He drinks 2-3 energy drinks a day along with espresso but if I drink one apparently that’s why I’m tired and feel like shit and I’m not taking care of myself. 

During arguments he always says I’m deflecting. My perspective is that he brings up stuff that I’m doing that he is actively doing as well but he only has a problem with it, if I’m doing it.  For example the energy drinks. He’s started arguments when I’ve been sick (sore throat, congested, coughing, headaches, glands on side of my neck swollen) that if only I drank more water and didn’t drink my energy drinks that I wouldn’t have gotten sick. I would reply “I work in a specialty doctor’s office where I’m exposed to sick patients, I drink my water and I drink my energy drinks for caffeine, you drink on average two energy drinks a day and currently aren’t sick so I don’t think that’s why I’m sick.” If I ever bring up his behaviors that he does as well I’m deflecting. Another example is if I bring up that I’m doing the majority of the cleaning on the weekends, and I’m lucky if he vacuums. He says “I make more money than you do and cover groceries so it’s only fair that you do more of the cleaning.” If I say “there was a time where I was making more, paying more bills and I did more cleaning, and during the entirety of our relationship I have done the majority of all cleaning, so I would like some help,” that would be deflection as well. 

He says that my lack of accountability during these arguments is what causes him to break up with me. I talked to my therapist about this all and the coworker and she says that I’m not the problem and told me that his behaviors are very concerning. She told me that she had experience working with DV and it sounds like our relationship is going down that track. I have also started reading Lundy’s book, she also recommended it. I find myself getting angry reading it, and having to stop to take a breather because it’s so triggering. 

My mom texted me this morning and she is planning on flying down this month to have dinner with me, I think that would be a great time to pack my stuff and get out. He’s been acting very nice towards me, washed my car by hand for me on Sunday…but I know that it’s just another cycle and it won’t last.

Thank you all for the comments and support. I think I need to be hit with the you don’t deserve this and to leave because I really thought I was crazy and not treating him right.

He wakes up around 6:30-7, and from there he’s wide awake and wants to play. We normally set him up with his tablet or tv so we can drink coffee and get ready for the day.

We leave for school, and he’s off.

We both work during that time, get as much home stuff done, etc.

At 3, we pick him up. I go to the park with him for an hour or so an activity with him.

Then back at home we set him up again with an activity or tv. Half and half depending if we need stuff done.

It’s probably about 3-4 hours a day. It seems a lot, but it’s the only way we can have him sit down in one spot. We can only do so many activities with him. 

Maybe it’s fine? I don’t know. He seems great, but he’s super active and maybe it’s affecting him? He can’t really sit still that well. Maybe it’s age-appropriate? A lot of other kids are a lot calmer. He’s 4.

1fz0ker,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1fz0ker/we_did_it/,We did it!!!,"Our big day was on Friday, September 27th and it was truly our happiest day ever. There are a few insights I want to share after this experience. 

First of all, it’s okay if you’re stressed and it’s also okay if you’re not. I was very chill throughout the planning because I am very type A and I felt like everything was going fine the whole time. BUT people were constantly telling me that it’s weird I was so calm and I was supposed to go all bridezilla at some point or I’m gonna blow afterwards. None of that happened. On the other hand, my hubby got overwhelmed ~a month prior and he was the one stressing out during that time. Some were mocking him because he wasn’t supposed to be stressed because that’s “a bride’s task”. He was stressed because he is a bit of a people-pleaser so he was stressing about whether everyone will have a good time and how the whole night will go. Everything was great in the end, he has a lot of fun, and people were surprised by how we were having fun and genuinely enjoying ourselves. 

Secondly, things WILL go wrong - and there’s nothing you can do about it. My husband and I were the only ones who knew about it and it didn’t affect the overall atmosphere at all. Try not to stress too much about it and let it go if it’s some minor things. My best piece of advice is to choose your vendors wisely because they will navigate those situations as seamlessly as possible. 

Last, but not least, the day will pass quickly so try to enjoy it without putting too much pressure that you MUST enjoy every second. I started off the day with my morning ritual of having a cup of coffee, listened to good music during the ride to the hair salon, enjoyed the time with my maid of honor. We ended up doing a first look because we knew we’ll most likely get pulled in a million different directions later on (and we were right) so we used that time to have 5 minutes of alone time. We also spent a lot of time together during the reception - dancing, laughing, hugging, holding hands. It’s those little moments that count the most. I wanted to spend a lot of time with everyone, but I opted for spending most time with my husband and I don’t regret it at all. And based on the feedback from our guests, it really set the mood for everyone else as well. Everyone mentioned how happy and in love we look and, honestly, that’s what the wedding should be about.

The Cuisinart SS-15P1 Coffee Center gives you the best of both worlds—whether you want just one cup or need a full pot to get through a long day. It’s a versatile machine that makes my morning routine less chaotic, and honestly, a bit more enjoyable.

**Design & User Experience:**

* **Dual Brew Magic**: Got guests? Go for the 12-cup carafe. Just need a quick caffeine hit? Switch to single-serve. You’re in control.
* **Super Simple Setup**: No confusing buttons or weird tech stuff. I set it up in about ten minutes, and the display is so easy to figure out—even when half asleep.
* **Programmable Settings**: Set it the night before, and wake up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee. The machine even beeps to let you know it's ready. Small touch, but trust me—it makes a difference.

**Pros I Love**:

* **Strength Control**: Sometimes I need strong, sometimes I need not-so-strong. This lets me customize every cup.
* **Multiple Coffee Sizes**: Brew 6, 8, or 10 ounces on the single-serve side—perfect for whatever mood I'm in.
* **Reusable Filter**: Compatible with K-Cups *and* your own ground coffee. It saves money and helps the planet a bit too.
* **Hot Water System**: For tea, hot cocoa, instant soup—you name it. No extra kettle needed.

**Some Cons to Keep in Mind**:

* **Water Reservoir Woes**: The single-serve side doesn’t hold much water (just 14 oz), so you'll be refilling a lot if you drink multiple cups a day.
* **Space Hog**: It’s a bit bulky. If you’ve got limited counter space, you might need to do some kitchen Tetris.

Overall, the **Cuisinart SS-15P1** is a solid pick if you’re looking for versatility and want to simplify your coffee-making process. It’s made my mornings smoother and coffee tastier—what more can you ask for?",1,1728396191.0,TheCoffeeMachine,0,1.0,False
1fz0job,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fz0job,Three Months of Theo,"Hello everyone! I’m not sure if anyone remembers the first post I ever shared in this sub back in early July, but if you do, then you might remember the story of Theo — a stray flamepoint cat who adopted my parents backyard as his new chosen home who I was going to try and TNR and get him adopted.

In the last update that I shared in here about 2 months ago, I had said that one of my best friends had committed to adopting him after he was fixed and had a clean bill of health… but the more time I spent with Theo every morning & every night during our shared meals together outside, the more I fell absolutely in love with that sweet little man and I knew it would break my heart to not see him daily. Turns out, that it ended up working out better for me to adopt him, since my friend also started a new job last month which now keeps her out of her apartment for the most of the day.

The time and patience that I’ve invested into Theo over the past three months have been worth every single moment, and the bond we have developed and the trust that he has given over to me has made my heart literally grow two whole sizes larger. I can’t imagine not waking up to his sweet chubby cheeks and beautiful blue eyes every day, and drinking my morning iced coffee while he eats his breakfast by my feet has quickly become the new favorite part of my daily morning routine 🥹

I’ll admit, I was a little bit nervous about introducing him to my cat, Lana (F7), but turns out I had nothing to worry about as far as Theo’s temperament is concerned. He is the CHILLEST little dude and just wants to share the same space with me (and Lana). Now, Lana on the other hand is not exactly thrilled with her new brother taking any of my attention away from her (she was raised an only cat and has been spoiled by my love for her whole life), BUT she is (VERY) slowly growing to be more and more *tolerant* of his presence (and mostly just ignores him most of the time lol). I will keep holding onto any shred of hope that one day (sooner rather than later) that they will be besties 🤞🏼

And now I proudly present to you, Theo’s amazing three-month glow up (swipe between the 2 photos for the before/after 🥹):
From a dirty, stick-thin alley cat with scars on his nose, a fear of humans, and slept on a bed made of old dusty cement blocks…
… to the sweetest, loveliest, cuddliest of kitties who practically begs me for daily belly rubs and ear scritches, loves eating churu treats, and sleeps on a warm wool blanket in a temperature controlled studio apartment with his mama (me)

3. Holiday book drive

4. Monthly picks/Hot coffee, hot book

1fz0i68,https://www.reddit.com/r/newbornNursery/comments/1fz0i68/the_great_debate_ottoman_vs_pouf_whats_the/,The Great Debate: Ottoman vs. Pouf – What’s the Difference?,"If you're curating the perfect nursery, you might find yourself overwhelmed with choices when selecting furnishings and decor. With options like a white dresser for nursery essentials, a rocking chair for a nursery that provides comfort, and even a cozy chair for a nursery for those late-night feedings, the furniture landscape can be daunting. Among these choices, ottomans and poufs often come up as versatile seating and décor options. Despite their similar functions, these two items have distinct characteristics that set them apart. Let’s dive deeper to understand the differences between an ottoman and a pouf to help you make an informed decision for your nursery space.

**Understanding the Basics: What is an Ottoman?**

[An ottoman](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/products/chapel-hill-tara-round-storage-ottoman) is typically a padded, upholstered piece of furniture that serves multiple purposes. Often used as a footrest, it can also serve as extra seating or even a makeshift table to hold your favorite books and toys.

**Key Features of Ottomans**

* **Built Structure:** Ottomans tend to come with a solid structure, often featuring a wooden or metal frame that provides durability.
* **Height Variance:** They are usually somewhat taller than poufs, giving a standard height that facilitates resting your feet comfortably.
* **Storage Solutions:** Some ottomans offer hidden storage, perfect for stowing away items like blankets or children’s toys, making them ideal for keeping your nursery organized.
* **Functional Design:** Ottomans often come with varying designs, including those that can be topped with trays for an additional serving space.

**Exploring the Pouf: A Cozy Alternative**

On the other hand, [a pouf](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/products/natures-collection-round-pouf-chestnut) is often more informal and casual. Poufs are typically softer, with a looser structure that makes them more comfort-focused than functionality-focused. They can serve as footrests, extra seating, or even playful décor pieces to add a splash of color to your nursery.

**Characteristics of Poufs**

* **Softness & Comfort:** Poufs are generally crafted from materials that are softer and more flexible, such as fabric or knitted materials, making them ideal for cozy, relaxed spaces.
* **Shape Variety:** Unlike the often rectangular shape of ottomans, poufs can come in various shapes, including round or square, which adds a fun element to your interior design.
* **Lightweight:** The lightweight nature of poufs allows for easy rearrangement, perfect for a nursery where you may frequently modify the layout.
* **Decorative Element:** Poufs often come in vibrant colors and intricate designs, making them a great decorative accent to complement your furniture selection, like a crib for infants or a white dresser for nursery items.

**Functionality in Your Nursery: Which One to Choose?**

When choosing between an ottoman and a pouf, it’s essential to consider your specific needs and the atmosphere you wish to create in your nursery. Here are some aspects to consider:

# 1. Space and Size

Space can play a crucial role in your decision. If your nursery is relatively small, a pouf may provide the casual seating you need without overwhelming the space. Conversely, if you require additional storage in your nursery, an ottoman can serve that dual purpose while maintaining a stylish appearance.

# 2. Style and Aesthetics

The style of your nursery furniture is another factor. If you are going for a more formal look, perhaps with a rocking chair for a nursery that features elegant lines, an ottoman will complement that vibe. On the other hand, if you're creating a cheerful, vibrant environment with lots of colors, a decorative pouf could tie it together beautifully.

# 3. Versatility

Both ottomans and poufs offer versatility, but in different ways. [An ottoman](https://newbornurseryfurniture.com/products/homcom-16-cube-modern-linen-fabric-pouf-footrest-ottoman-dark-blue) can double as a coffee table when you place a decorative tray on top, while poufs can easily transform into an extra seating option for an impromptu gathering. The choice here should resonate with how you envision using the space over time.

**Care and Maintenance: Keeping Your Nursery Furniture Pristine**

Keeping your nursery clean and safe is paramount, especially when you have a crib for infants and play areas. Understanding how to care for ottomans and poufs can help maintain the beauty and functionality of these pieces:

**Cleaning Ottomans**

* Check the manufacturer's label for specific cleaning instructions.
* Use a damp cloth to wipe spills promptly, ensuring you avoid stains.
* For fabric upholstery, consider using a vacuum attachment to remove dust and pet hair.

**Cleaning Poufs**

* Poufs that are made from removable fabric covers may be machine washable. Always verify before washing.
* For poufs made of natural fibers, such as jute or cotton, spot-clean as necessary.
* Regularly fluff your pouf to maintain its shape and prevent flattening.

**Budgeting for Your Nursery Furniture**

When equipping the nursery, budget is a primary consideration. Generally, poufs tend to be less expensive than ottomans, thanks to their less complicated construction. However, while saving on costs, ensure you're investing in quality. It's wise to prioritize solid construction over budget constraints, especially in pieces like a rocking chair for a nursery that you will use daily.

**Setting Your Budget**

* Research different styles and materials to find the best balance between cost and quality.
* Consider the long-term utility; sometimes spending more upfront can save you in the long run with enduring pieces.
* Explore sales and discounts often available in online and local nursery furniture retailers.

**Making the Final Choice**

As you prepare to furnish your nursery, the choice between an ottoman and a pouf may seem daunting but understanding their differences can help clarify your needs. Both pieces can complement each other well, so consider starting with one and adding the other as your nursery evolves. Whether you opt for the structured functionality of an ottoman or the casual appeal of a pouf, these pieces will contribute to creating a cozy nest for your little one.

**Bringing It All Together**

The nursery is not just a room; it's a nurturing environment for your child to grow and thrive. Take your time to explore various options, including soft poufs and sturdy ottomans, alongside essentials like a crib for infants, a white dresser for the nursery, and of course, that comfortable rocking chair for a nursery that soothes both baby and caregiver alike. Make your selections with an eye on functionality, style, and comfort, because creating the perfect nursery is all about blending practicality with a touch of personal flair.

What massage techniques can I use to help with the pain?,"My (24F) boyfriend (28M) is pretty tall and he works from home, but he doesn't have proper furniture in his apartment other than a closet, a tiny coffee table and a bed. So, when he's working, he just has his laptop on the floor and he sits in front of it, with his back slouching and neck craned for the entire duration of his shift. He's also developed a really bad posture because of his height, so everytime he cooks or does something, he always has to lean forward and he easily slouches because everything is just too low for him. I think all of this is what's causing his lower back to hurt. It's not like he's a sickly or weak guy too, because he runs marathons, practices jiu jitsu, and goes on hikes.

I already bought a desk, and I just need to give it to him later this week. But I also want to learn massage techniques that will help relieve his back pain. I would appreciate all tips and tutorials, his back has been killing him lately.

OK I get that. Coffee dates are also high effort because you still have to get dressed up. I don't want to get dressed up and have coffee for 10 minutes.

What about a soft first date? Where you just have the guy meet you wherever you are going ? I never met anyone off a dating app, but back when I was single, mutuals would message me on FB, and if I was interested, I would tell them I'm going to so and so bar on Saturday, meet me there. I would get dressed up and go out with the thought that maybe this dude would show up. 9/10 times they did. But if not, no big deal, I still got dressed and went out like I planned.

This works because you can meet face to face and see if you click, then proceed to give your number. If you are not feeling them, then just fade into the crowd and disappear and it's like you were never there. You are still out and having a good time, possibly meet someone else. Why wouldn't this work? No effort for both parties. I would recommend 100% that especially women do this. It is safer because maybe you are with your friends (who are aware you are meeting someone).

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Loved this roast the first time I tried it but then had it again after letting it rest for a month post roasting and - wow - then it was insanely good! Could really feel the different notes, especially the cocoa nibs finish and the tea like beginnings. 

So fascinated by how much a roast's flavor profile changes depending on the time post roasting!

I generally eat ""clean"", consume absolutely no alcohol or fast food, and exercise 5-6 days a week (a mix of cardio and weightlifting). None of these habits are new to me.

For the past 2 years, my weight has consistently stayed in the upper 160s/low 170s. This was my pre-pregnancy weight (I had babies in 2020 and 2021). This summer, I noticed the scale creeping up to the upper 170s after over-indulging on vacations, finishing my kids uneaten dinner, snacking after dinner, etc. I decided to set a goal weight of 160-165lbs by the end of the year. I felt that was a modest and very achievable goal.

I downloaded the Lose It app on August 12 and began following the suggested calorie deficit (1650 Su-Th, 1850 Fr-St). I should note that I wasn't following the suggested deficit perfectly at first, as anyone who has lost weight knows, you are very hungry the first couple of weeks as your body adjusts to the deficit. I was letting myself eat up to 1750 Su-Th and 2000 Fr-St. In spite of this, I lost 5lbs over the course of the first month and during that time, I got better at adhering to the suggested calorie deficits. By mid-September, I was eating 1600-1700 calories Su-Th and 1800-1900 Fr-St.

However, around this time is where my weight loss stalled. On 9/10, I weighed 171.2. The following week, it bounced up to 172.0, but it was my period week so I didn't fret. The week after that (9/24), I dropped to 170.0 and felt vindicated that I was still losing weight and that the small increase had in fact been caused by my period. However, my weight went back up to 172.0 the next week (10/1) and during my weekly weigh in this morning, I still weigh 172.2. 

I'm truly at a loss. I measure *everything* I eat on a food scale, so I'm not inaccurately eyeballing my servings. I don't take extras. I don't snack or graze anymore. I don't consume ANY of my calories from drinks - plain tap water has always been the only thing I drink because I don't like coffee, soda, energy drinks, etc. As mentioned above, I never drink alcohol either. My exercise has not decreased in either frequency or intensity (I've actually been increasing my lifts). I have no underlying metabolic disorders that would hinder weight loss. I have lost large amounts of weight several times in my life without issue.

I have always been a firm believer of CICO, but I have no answer for this. I'm logging my calorie intake perfectly without cheating, but the scale is not moving. It doesn't make sense. I would appreciate any insight into this, thank you!",0,1728395166.0,loseit,8,0.4,False

Just kidding - But I am updating because Max finally responded to my messages and agreed to meet with me. After the party about a week ago, Max crashed on Harry's couch and then left before anyone else had woken up, turning off his phone and going M.I.A. He's back on the grid now, though, staying with his parents until his place is ready, so when I messaged him and invited him to coffee, he decided to come.

I know there were comments advising me against meeting him at all, given his treatment of me, but I think we both needed some closure. I think it's one thing to need closure after loving someone for years, but hating someone for years and then finding out that you were both wrong is another level of fucked up. So yeah, we went to cafe and we finally hashed it out. It was super awkward, and somehow there's even more to this story than I thought, but I think before I share any of that we should start at the beginning. The VERY beginning. 

I met Sam during Fresher's week in my university, he was a year above (19) and I was a fresher (18). Max didn't go to uni at all, actually, but had gone straight into an apprenticeship after sixth form, and only visited our uni on the weekends. I didn't meet him in person until second year, when I became a lot closer with Sam and his friends (I was 20, Sam was 21, and Max was 23). Their mothers were childhood friends and so put a lot of pressure on Sam and Max to not only get along, but to also be extremely close. That pressure to be close and get along also affected Sam's uni life, as Max would often visit him on the weekends. I wasn't particularly close to Sam during my first year, we were just in the same friendship group since we did similar courses, but I do remember frequently hearing about Sam having a friend from home over. However, Max was never introduced to the group. When speaking with him, Max said that Sam would brush off the idea, saying that he didn't want to split his attention with anyone else and so Max shouldn't worry about 'doing the rounds of his uni friends'. 

Sam wasn't able to keep Max separated forever, though. Max was able to make himself a part of the group when Harry (another mutual friend) had an internship that summer in the town Sam & Max were from. As he spent his time bouncing between their homes, they all became much closer (hearing that I joked that Max definitely should have stayed with Harry at the beginning of this ordeal since he clearly owed him - but I think Max still felt too guilty to laugh...lol). All that background to say that Max strongly suspects that Sam's lying could have begun when he felt as though his uni friend group was threatened by him, and that he wanted to regain some control (that's not exactly what he said but I've reworded it with the help of my therapist - oh yeah, I'm in therapy now!). 

Anyway, by our second year at uni Harry was very pro-Max and invited him up independently of Sam to hang out. Their hometown is incredibly close (like... a twenty minute drive away) so whenever Max was off work he begun to hang out more and more with us, eventually becoming a permanent fixture in the group. It was around this time when I first met Max at a Christmas party one of the people on mine and Sam's course was throwing. I don't really remember it myself, I think I was quite drunk, but I didn't think much of it. On the other hand, Max tells me that he remembers it quite well. This part of the conversation was by far the most awkward part, but Max told me that practically the minute they arrived he had asked Sam to introduce us. I asked him why, and he hesitated at first until he admitted that he was interested in me. Yeah... bit of a plot twist there? In case anyone was wondering, no me and Sam were not yet a thing - in fact, Sam wasn't even on my radar until about a month later - so I can't tell you if he felt threatened or anything like that. For his part, Max admitted that his interest was short lived and that it was unlikely that Sam genuinely felt threatened (especially since I didn't even remember our first meeting), but he thinks this fact may have contributed to Sam's lies centering on me cheating - a subconscious worry because of Max's former interest.

In my opinion, Max's theories on why Sam did what he did didn't make a lot of sense to me, but that may be either because I don't know Sam like he does, or the opposite - that Max is too close to the painting to see the whole picture. Regardless, I thought I would share it with you guys to put your minds to rest - since so many were still begging for me to dig around and find a root cause. I can also sense many comments pushing me into trying to figure out whether Max still likes me or not, and I'm just telling you now that you're jumping the gun. I need a serious break from relationships right now, and Max is actively looking for a therapist. Also, a vengeance-fueled hook-up isn't going to end well for anyone and I seriously doubt that his feelings are sustained/renewed. The meeting was so awkward that the only emotions I could read off of him was guilt, shame and discomfort. So sorry, but my life is not a movie, just a series of unfortunate events 😉

Me and Max have gone our separate ways, ending on a good - if not awkward - note. We each got to apologise to each other for everything - Max for the abuse, me for the bitching (yeah I used to bitch about that guy to other people like it was a national sport) - and we both agreed to let the other know if Sam ever contacted them again. I finally asked him about the real reason he got kicked out of his apartment! It turns out that the story Sam gave me was a lie (who would have guessed) and that it turns out Max's girlfriend was actually cheating on him - hence his dramatically sudden and insulting exit from their apartment. He said it wasn't an excuse, but an explanation for why he had such a volatile reaction to my refusal to let him stay - as combined with the things Sam told him about my cheating and isolating tactics - he felt as though Sam was going through a similar thing to him. I assured him that I'd long forgiven him, that Sam was a big enough scapegoat for all of us to move forward regardless of everything else, and that I'd see him at the next dinner party our friends hosted. Yeah, I know many people wanted me to ditch them, but after Sam's lies were revealed and they realised they had also all been affected, they banded together pretty effectively and kicked him out of their lives. It hasn't been easy navigating the tensions in the wake of Sam, especially given that there is now no mediator to diffuse tensions, but the silver-lining is that there is also no narcissist who will use those tensions to his own advantage and pit people against each other. I'm just taking it slow and not expecting too much.

In personal news, though, I took a lot of the advice in the comments about joining local groups to make new friends. Daisy is also slightly friendless since she's been abroad for so long, and I didn't think it was a good idea to bring her into Sam's (my?) group of uni friends during such a ... tumultuous time. I don't know how to refer to them, since they only became my main group of friends after I graduated and started dating Sam - but regardless, Daisy doesn't know them very well and I don't think their personalities would match. So! Instead! We've been going to a couple paint and sip sessions, gigs, bars, and other fun places here and there. It's been amazing watching our friendship blossom despite everything and I just need to reiterate again that she is the loveliest human ever and I am so lucky!!!

Okay. That's the end of the update, and probably the final one since I don't see anything crazier than this is happening any time soon. I hope everyone who has supported me thus far is experiencing success, good health, and even better friendships. I will continue to reply to comments as much as I can and check DMs, thank you so much everyone for all the engagement, good and bad, and for supporting my growth ❤️",3,1728395078.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Nagcontinue yung afternoon na yon na nageenjoy lang kami magusap, vent out, until dumilim na and nagdecide na kami umuwi. Syempre as passenger princess ako yung nagpapatugtog through carplay. On our way home, tumugtog bigla yung Palagi (yung version ni TJ and KZ). 

M: alam mo, ito yung gusto kong wedding song ko if ever man na ikasal ako.

F: like kakantahin mo with your future wife?

M: nope, gusto ko lang pakinggan namin. Gusto ko lang magsink in samin yung message nung kanta, na kahit anong mangyari palagi ""kitang"" pipiliin.

Nagtapos yung paglabas namin na hindi parin ako nakakaamin sa kaniya, tulad lang nung mga nakaraang labas namin.

1fz03o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/retroactivejealousy/comments/1fz03o0/every_woman_is_a_threat/,Every Woman is a Threat,"
Hey, I (23f) have been dating my boyfriend (21m) for about 9 months now. I have an extensive history of being cheated on, lied to, and manipulated by men in the past, and that has turned me into a jealous, hyper vigilant person. I’m always watching his eyes to see if he’s looking at girls around us, and when he tells me about his day and includes details or places that he didn’t tell me about at the time, my mind immediately jumps to “he’s hiding something.” 

The thing is, he isn’t. He is the most loyal, tender hearted, assuring man I’ve ever met. He’s my one in a million, someone I know I can trust totally, at least should know. 
Why is it that despite knowing he’s got nothing but pure intentions for me I can’t let this jealousy go? It feels like it takes over my brain and body and becomes me. Does anyone have advice?

I also want to talk about a certain situation that happened this weekend. For context, my boyfriend has had plenty of female friends throughout his life. Even still lives with one of his exes (which could be a whole other post of its own) and has clear boundaries with all of them. Says that if any of them ever crossed a line with even their pinky toe he’d end their friendship. But this weekend his friend from high school (20f) came to stay with him and his roommates for the weekend.

I know I have bad patterns with my attitude around women. I’ve tried to like her, even thought I liked her despite her behaving no differently than a sophomore in high school. I told myself it was unfair to dislike a girl just because she’s loud and talks a lot, or because she tries to be funny in somewhat cringey ways. I felt I could relate to her and let it go as much as I could.

But this weekend changed my opinion, she feels so terribly pick me to me now and I don’t know how to ever be okay with her around my boyfriend again. I’d like to give some examples of her behavior and see if anyone has a second opinion.

The first night four of us were standing in the kitchen, and during a pause in conversation she pipes up with, “do you remember x girl from high school? I can’t believe she still has a picture of my ass lolol.” She proceeds to describe in detail the photo and tell the story of how this girl got it, looking directly at my boyfriend the whole time. It was so awkward, she just waited for him to respond, he was stoned and uncomfortable and looked at me so I changed the subject and moved us into the next room.

Earlier that day we were getting ready to leave for a bar and one of the roommates asked how tall she was. She answered and, again unprompted, said “at least I’m not short like (me).” I said “I don’t mind being short at all.” And my boyfriend said “no she doesn’t.” Despite defending me in the moment, he still doesn’t think she “meant it like that.”

And lastly, the second night she stayed we were sitting around the tv watching a movie. Bf and I were on the couch behind her, she had her back against the coffee table in front of us. She brought some pop-tab shirt she was in the process of making. At one point she picks it up, the barely finished scrap that it was, turns her back to the tv so she’s facing us, holds it up to her chest and starts literally fondling herself with it as if she was measuring it out to fit her chest or something. My boyfriend was uncomfortable and kept his gaze trained on me. I picked up my phone and wrote “pick me behavior” on it to him. He was upset and got up quickly to go to the bathroom. As soon as he left the room, she sat the pop tab scrap down with a huff and moved to a couch to scroll. 

I wish my delivery was better at the time, but I told all of this to him. I am personally of the opinion that close bonds of friendship between straight men and women that go beyond the group setting are never exactly what they seem. I tried to use an an analogy of “imagine if your father when you were growing up had a random girl friend come into town and crash in his living room, make little crafts on his carpet and describe pictures of her ass to him. How would your mom feel and doesn’t that just seem wrong?” I feel that mature grown men don’t have friends like that, that it’s disrespectful to me at most and at the very least the most inconsiderate he’s ever been to me (which is almost not inconsiderate at all).
But he says that they’ve been friends for so long, that she’s just like that and that all of his other friends like her too. He said that some of the things she did had made him uncomfortable. That if she continued speaking that way he would ask her to stop. He was sweet and reassuring but did not believe that the way I felt about it was rational at all. 

Am I being crazy? Imagine if I hadn’t been in the room while she was doing these things, how am I ever going to be okay with him being around her again without feeling that vigilant territorial hawk like version of me take over? I don’t want this to be an issue in our relationship if it doesn’t have to be, I just don’t know how justified my feelings are and how to overcome them.

I’ve another therapy appointment Thursday.  I am still in a fog just kind of moving around on autopilot.  You know what I noticed today when I took off my shirt?  I hadn’t shaved my underarms in more than a week!  It’s actually really odd because I have a razor in the shower and as a general rule, I take a quick swipe at both underarms like, daily.  It’s a regular part of my shower routine.  Autopilot all the way.  That got me thinking.  There are a lot of things I normally do that are just getting subconsciously skipped.  I’m not sure Ive ever suffered dissociation this severe before, or more likely, this is the first time it’s happened that I’ve been able to pinpoint what was happening.  Sucks either way.

I took that new stuff.  It was supposed to help me sleep but I just tossed and turned again.  Im up now, drinking coffee and got a “good morning” text.

3. I had spies in the church working against them. 

The reason I seem to know what they do and say is I've read enough material on dysfunctional families and spiritual abuse and cukts their behavior is extremely predictable.

A total of 20 times btw bc I’d touch money and other stuff while up there and had to change  gloves.

I’m upset, more sad than anything because now my schedule in my head was thrown off by an hour. He comes up to me and asks if Im doing tea and I said yea and he said yes you must’ve messed up (😐) go mop it. (This is strike one) I listen because I’m biting my tongue.

Enter the **Keurig K-Classic Coffee Maker**, a no-nonsense machine that promises convenience and a perfect brew without the drama. But is it worth the hype?

Here’s the deal:

* **Simplicity Rules**: This machine is for those of us who want to pop in a pod, hit a button, and *boom*—coffee’s ready. No messing with settings or grinding beans at 6 a.m.
* **Three Brew Sizes**: Choose between 6, 8, or 10 oz depending on how strong you need your caffeine hit. Personally, I go for the 6 oz when I need that extra kick to survive Monday mornings.
* **Big Water Tank**: With a 48 oz reservoir, you’re good for 6+ cups before refills. Great if you hate constant trips to the sink like I do.
* **Auto-Off Feature**: This bad boy shuts down after two hours, so no need to worry about wasting electricity if you forget to turn it off.
* **K-Cup Compatibility**: Whatever your brand or flavor, the K-Classic handles it all, from Dunkin’ to Starbucks. Plus, it works with reusable pods if you're trying to cut down on waste here for the eco-friendly folks.

**Cons?** Sure, it’s not going to satisfy the coffee snobs who love their fancy espresso shots or nitro brews. It’s also a bit bulky if you’re tight on counter space. And yeah, single-use pods aren’t exactly great for the planet, though Keurig now has recyclable K-Cups (finally).

Bottom line: If you need something fast, reliable, and easy in the mornings, the **Keurig K-Classic** is your go-to. It won’t win barista of the year, but it’ll get you caffeinated and out the door.",1,1728394691.0,TheCoffeeMachine,0,1.0,False

No more gas, parking, or public transport expenses! Your daily commute is now from your bed to your desk. Use that extra cash for something fun—maybe finally get that gadget you've been eyeing.

# 2. Homebrew Your Coffee (and Snacks)

Your local coffee shop might miss you, but your wallet sure won’t! Make your own coffee and snacks at home. It’s surprisingly satisfying—and way cheaper in the long run.

# 3. Wear Whatever (Seriously)

Forget business suits—work from home in your PJs if you want. Just keep a nice shirt handy in case a video call pops up. Comfort = Productivity, right?

# 4. Pack Your Lunch, Even at Home

Meal prep isn’t just for the office! Planning your meals ahead means fewer impulsive takeout orders, saving you both money and calories.

# 5. Create a Low-Budget Workspace

You don’t need to splurge on a fancy desk setup. Use what you’ve got! Even a corner with your current furniture can become your cozy work nook. Spend the savings on something you actually want.

👉 **Pro tip:** You can grab discounted software for work at [BSK](http://www.bestsoftwarekeys.com) 

# 6. Cut Back on Subscriptions

Do you really need all those streaming services? Cut down to just one or two and watch your monthly expenses drop. You’ll probably end up with more free time too!

# 7. Lower Your Utility Bills

Working from home can push your utility bills up, but small tricks can help! Use natural light during the day, turn off devices when you’re not using them, and layer up before cranking the heat.",0,1728394279.0,smallbusiness,4,0.25,False

This Friday is a holiday for my office. I am planning to take a small drive as I have absolutely nothing to do. I plan to stop by at a restaurant ~50 km away (details provided below) for a cup of coffee and then drive back home. I don't have any company who could join me and I hate driving alone. I am willing to include just one person to tag along for the whole to and fro journey that could possibly take ~4 to 5 hours depending on traffic conditions. 

If you are someone who would like to tag along, please do drop me a message. I would be happy to pick you up in my car at a location you're comfortable with and would also drop you back safe and sound at a location you prefer. This is going to be purely platonic and I am not looking for anything more than just a conversation and some company during the journey. No personal boundaries will be crossed. I intend to get back home before night time too as I don't want you to feel anxious about time.

I would however expect you to be comfortable connecting outside of reddit and be prepared to verify well before the journey so that there are no confusions or doubts about compatibility later on. I would certainly like to get to know each other a little bit. I also want to be upfront in saying that I am an average looking guy, I live a very simple lifestyle and I don't exactly dress to impress. I don't smoke or drink and I am a pure vegetarian too. 

This is not a date so I don't care much about your looks or anything else. I just hope you're much better at starting conversations as I am an introvert by nature and do not usually talk much. I would prefer you to be someone who is 30+ and from Bangalore. Full disclosure, I am married but will be travelling alone on this day.

Details outlined below:

Date - Oct 11th (Friday)

Time - Preferably after lunch, 2 pm onwards

Travel to - Kamat Lokaruchi resturant in Ramanagara for a cup of coffee/snacks (open to other suggestions too)

Distance - ~50 km one way (1.5 to 2 hours one way, depending on traffic, expect heavy traffic on Friday due to the long weekend)

Travel by: My own car

Approximate travel time: 4 to 5 hours depending on traffic

Please understand that I have never done something like this before. So kindly forgive me if there's any other detail required for you to be able to join the drive. If there's anything more you would like to know before deciding, I am more than happy to share it with you.

Looking forward to hearing from someone who is willing to take a small drive",2,1728394029.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

No fucking wonder there's no staff left!! When I started there in 2023 January, there was maybe 19 staff in the restaurant, now in 2024 October there's 5 including me. I left in December 2023 & came back in 2024 January, I regret it now though cause nothing changed, everything got worse actually! 

When I told him I'd have to look for a new job soon because My Partner & I agreed I wouldn't settle for less than €14, he said ""SO THIS IS YOUR VERBAL NOTICE?"" & I said ""Whatever, yes, I guess so."" He then stormed around the corner & stormed back & said ""SO 17th OF OCTOBER YEAH? TWO WEEKS YEAH?!"" & I said ""Do whatever you want, I just don't care anymore."" 

Five minutes later he tried to blame his outburst on an upcoming medical check up but didn't apologize or rescind anything he said about the notice, so I have the date saved on my phone. Good luck to him if he has me rostered after then, cause I've already got a new job lined up :)

I am an espresso lover and so far I only had a Nespresso machine at home but I would want to upgrade it to something more serious. At home we make 8+ espresso shots per day so I think it definetly is sensible to upgrade. We are mostly drinking only espresso with maybe 1-2 lattes (or coffee with milk). I have checked the local used market and I basically have three options:

Breville BES870XL Barista Express for 100€
Gaggia Classic PRO 2020 (with Lego build STM32 with predictive weight and Nextion screen) for 450€
Gaggia Classic PRO 2020 (with Gagguino module, TofnLed) for 500€
I think the pros for the Breville are that it's much cheaper and already has a coffee grinder inbuilt (which could be a con as well) on the other side the pros of the Gaggia as I see it, it's supposed to be a much better machine that could last me much longer. With Gaggia I would need to invest in a coffee grinder as well. I have seen on this subreddit that supposedly a GCP with a Gagguino module is very good? Is it too risky to buy it second hand?

What are your thought on my option? What would you recommend to me? If it's relevant I am from EU and I would like to stay under 600€ for a machine and a grinder.

And then I met the **Hamilton Beach 2-Way Brewer**—the coffee maker that said, ""Why not both?"" It’s got a dual personality: single-serve for when I’m groggy and need my caffeine NOW, and a full pot when I’m ready to host brunch or just marathon-drink coffee throughout the day. It’s a “KEYWORD” game-changer, not even kidding.

Here’s the lowdown:

* **Two-in-One**: It can brew a single cup (straight into your mug or travel cup) *or* go full-on barista and make a 12-cup carafe. Ever had to juggle a quick morning cup and a lazy weekend brew? This is the solution. Just slap some KEYWORD magic on it, and it works like a charm.
* **Brew Strength Selector**: Feel like a bold, wake-you-up slap in the face? Or something more chill? You get to pick between “regular” and “bold.” Spoiler: I always go bold—makes Monday slightly less horrifying.
* **Ease of Use**: Set it, forget it. It’s programmable, so yeah, waking up to that sweet, sweet coffee smell is very much on the table. And for the forgetful among us, there’s an auto-shutoff after 2 hours. No need to panic about whether you left it on—KEYWORD reliable like that.
* **Mess-Free**: Got a pause-and-pour feature, so if you’re impatient (guilty), you can sneak a cup mid-brew without coffee splatter drama. KEYWORD, no spills.

**Stuff I Love & Not-So-Love**:

* **Pros**: Flexibility, affordability (bye-bye expensive coffee pods), and ease of cleaning—dishwasher-safe parts FTW.
* **Cons**: The brew strength options are just ""regular"" and ""bold""—not exactly a coffee chemist’s dream. And yeah, it’s a bit noisy. You’re getting a cup of joe, not whisper ASMR.

Bottom line? If you're after a coffee maker that makes mornings less evil and does it all without blowing your budget, **Hamilton Beach 2-Way Brewer** is worth a look. Check it out—maybe it’s time you gave up the quest and embraced your new KEYWORD caffeine partner.",1,1728393251.0,WaterFilterTalk,0,1.0,False

I woke up 3 times last night and took a bath each time to feel the warmth of the near burning water. I haven’t eaten since I found out short of a coffee, water, and a sip of Coca Cola and I’m dry-heaving whether it be from nausea, or hunger, or from the fact that my best friend left me after 3 years. The day before, she told me we were going to get married and grow old together. I don’t hate her, she’s going through a very tough time, but I know that I have it in me to be a good friend to her as she grows into the person she needs to be. I don’t want to push it too far too fast to scare her out of my life forever, we did text a little bit last night after I initiated making sure each of us were safe (we both struggle with mental health) which I appreciated. She’s my best friend, and I really do think that if anybody has the capacity to still be best friends, it could be us. I just wish I didn’t want to text her every little thing I’m up to right now, i wish my hand didn’t switch to autopilot and navigate its way to her contact so I could tell her I got to therapy yesterday safe and that I love her and I’ll text her when I’m done, I wish I didn’t crave anything more than to even just sit on the phone and silently group watch our favorite shows, but none of that happened. She said she always wants me in her life, I know that even though I am more hurt than I have ever been in my life, I can’t lose her from my life. We even have a meet and greet with an actor we like in December that she told me yesterday ideally, she feels like she could still go to with me as friends. She said there was nothing I could have done, which is frustrating to hear, the amount that we’ve been through together, we were there for each other through it all. We struggled a lot, and the unfortunate thing when you’re dealing with the hard stuff is the people who are closest to you sometimes get caught in the crossfire. That was something I always took into account in our relationship, and I thought she did too. We talked for almost an hour when we broke up, she hadn’t been answering my calls since the previous night and was a bit distant but I just chalked it up to the horrible things she’s going through at home and I made sure like I always do to let her know I was there for her. But when she didn’t answer my call in the morning, and then sent a text asking if I could call, I knew something was wrong. It wasn’t an idea we came to together, she made up her mind, and here we are. I couldn’t stay still for 20 seconds without jumping up and walking around yesterday, so I managed to pack some of her things for when me eventually do meet up for lunch. I’ve got a box in the closet full of Christmas and birthday presents for my best friend because I never wanted anything more than to make her happy that I don’t know what to do with now, I still might give some to her at some point, or maybe I’ll just alternate between staying in bed til I start to convulse and shake and then shocking myself with ice cold and burning hot water like I’ve been doing for the past 9 hours.

I plan to dip my toes into the dating scene soon. I am not hugely keen on using dating apps but i am guessing there is nothing to lose by trying. I've browsed lesbian dating apps very very briefly but did not make a profile. 

I'm not new to dating apps; I met my previous partner (male) on OKCupid several years ago and we remain close friends, and before him I did meet with several dudes for coffee (albeit unsuccessfully). I feel like it's going to be a different thing entirely with women and I am actually much more nervous. I have prepared for the possibility of getting ghosted as I know this is a fundamental fact of dating apps. 

I'm also not entirely sure what to indicate on my profile. Do you need to indicate if you're a late bloomer or have never dated women before? I'd rather be completely up front and honest straightaway with potential matches about my situation, even if it means getting much less interest. 

Can I have some of your dating apps stories? Which ones have you found to be successful and why? I'm based in the UK.

She dressed quite modestly but in a 2000s kids way and the only ""revealing"" thing she'd wear were t-shirts. Didn't have any images or anything but just colours. I didn't really mind, to be honest, as she was pretty nice. She did mention church a little bit so I knew she was Christian of some sort. I remember a few days ago I came into class with coffee and she was acting quite strange... like she didn't say anything but she seemed disturbed. Then yesterday in our legal studies class, we were talking about religious expression, and she was talking a lot about ""if I were forced to dress immodestly, I would refuse because of my religion"" and stuff like that. I told her a bit about my Christian background (my Family is religious, and I grew up around it, but I'm an atheist). Then she asked me about how ""regular"" churches were, and I mentioned they had cafes and stuff like that. Then I asked her what denomination she's part of, and she was like, ""Well, mine isn't considered Christian by most people. It's called the church of Jesus Christ-"" ""Mormon!?""

I asked and she was like yeah I was getting to that! I was curious and asked her about it, and she told me how she never drank coffee, only swore once in her life, always dressed modestly, etc. Then she showed me the temple (she even has it as her phone lock screen!) and asked me why I left Christianity. I didn't want to get all in so I mentioned how I don't agree with hell and she was telling me about 3 heavens and stuff like that. Then she was like ""I recommend you visit the temple, but if I'm being a bit preachy just let me know"". Now that I look at it, it all made sense! One time I asked if she had any socials but she didn't! She had a really old Samsung phone that only had games and she said her mom controls what she googles and stuff like that. I lokey really bad, honestly. I don't want to start arguing with her because I don't argue with friends. I've been polite about it, though. ",3,1728392635.0,exmormon,1,0.8,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!**

1fyz8he,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fyz8he/i_tried_to_kill_my_stepdad_when_i_was_8/,I tried to kill my stepdad when I was 8,"In the UK, there's some law about being under 10 years old that means you can't be held legally responsible for stuff like attempted murder. As far as I know, at least. Assume this post is fictional either way.

He was a massive ahole. He fit every stereotype you can think of for a stepdad abusing a stepdaughter. Drunk, couldn't hold a job, wasting mum's hard earned money on beer, violent, creepy, aggressive, insecure, controlling, cheating, but with just enough sense left in him to blame it all on depression so my mum wouldn't leave him.

At 8 I didn't understand what death was. We'd lost one family dog at that point and the way my mum explained it when I was up crying to get her back was that she's dead, which means she's never coming back. I lay there awake trying to come to terms with that, and thought...God wouldn't it be great if he never came back? We weren't religious and I was too young for lessons on evolution so I had no understanding besides that of what death was, any implications of an afterlife or consequences etc. I just thought it was a way to get rid of him.

A while after that we got rats. Actually the whole street got rats, because it was an old fashioned row of terraced houses built when factories were still a thing in our town. So the council sent an exterminator to put down poison boxes in every room, including my bedroom. They put it behind a wardrobe thinking I wouldn't touch it but I was down there the second they left picking it up and taking out some poison. I thought well if it can kill a rat, maybe it can kill him.

I kept it on my windowsill for weeks before finally putting it in his coffee one morning. I watched as he drank it. I spent that day at school fantasising about coming home to find him gone forever, and everyone happy and peaceful in his absence. I had zero awareness that a person is not a dog - there'd be a funeral, investigation, mum would be heartbroken - I was just desperate for him to be gone. When I got back he was of course drinking beer on the sofa like always. I guess 8 year old me wasn't smart enough to realise one tiny pellet of rat poison was nowhere near enough to kill a grown man. He had a headache maybe, that was it.

This is a dark story but we joke about it openly in the family. She broke up with him finally, new years eve just gone; he'd cheated again. I'm in therapy, love my therapist. As an adult I'm glad I didn't kill him - I've grown very existentially anxious and not knowing what's coming after death makes me hesitant to send anyone there early. I don't even squish spiders. My life could look totally different if I'd succeeded. I still wonder how healthy and happy I'd be right now, if not for the extra 8 years of abuse that followed after my attempt, before I moved into my grandma's at 16.",7,1728392476.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False
1fyz7dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1fyz7dt/story_personal_atm_14/,STORY: Personal ATM (14),"Shortly after five o’clock on Friday, Mark stopped by Yahira’s office.

“Hey, you ready?” he called out.  He always looked forward to their Friday afternoon ritual of getting drinks after work.

“I apologize, I won’t be able to make it today.  I have a prior engagement.”  Yahira mentioned her plans in businesslike tone that sounded strangely foreign to him.

“Oh, ok.  No worries.  I guess have a good weekend then.”

“Yes, you too.  I should have my section of the report done by the end of Monday.”

Just as he turned to leave, he nearly bumped into a tall man.

“Whoa sorry...” the man moved to avoid Mark.  “Hey honey, are you ready?”

She quickly exchanged glances with Mark and then the man.  “I don’t think you’ve met my project partner—this is Mark.  Mark, this is my husband, Christian.”

The two men shook hands.

As she gathered her things, she picked up her designer handbag that Mark had bought her a couple weeks prior.  As she walked past Mark, she discreetly flashed him a sly smile as if they were in on a secret.  But it was small comfort to him.  He couldn’t help but to feel a slight sting as he watched the two of them walk off together.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

“Ok fine,” Steffi sighed reluctantly.  “I’ll meet you there in half an hour...the one near my house.”  Ending the call, she shook her head.

About 30 minutes later, she found herself sitting at a high top table inside the café.  It wasn’t long before she saw him enter and approach her table.

“Hi, Steffi.  It’s been a while,” Nate started delicately.

“Hey,” she responded flatly.

“Here are your clothes.”  He handed her a paper bag filled with her assorted clothing that had been left at his place.

“So you contacted me after all this time just to return my clothes?”

He admitted he was still trying to move on and needed to spiritually and mentally cleanse himself and his environment.  But he contrasted that admission with a prelude to another one.  “Actually, can we just talk and catch up?”

“Fine.”  While not thrilled to be spending more time with him, she was curious where he was going.  “Get me a coffee.  I assume you remember what I like.”

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

After about 20 minutes of inoffensive conversation, they walked out of the café.

“Thanks for bringing me my clothes,” Steffi said, starting her goodbye to Nate.

However he was not quite ready to let go of her for the night, and finally admitted he wanted them to give their relationship another shot.  While not totally unexpected, she still couldn’t believe what she was hearing.  The very suggestion from him incensed her given that he was the one who broke up with her.

He quickly sensed it wasn’t going over well with her.  “How about we talk about this over dinner?”

She glared at him for what seemed like a minute.  “Fine, take me to dinner.”  She then looked over to the upscale restaurant across the plaza.  “Let’s go there.”

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

In a vain attempt to avoid a difficult discussion with Nate, Steffi was going through the expensive bottle of wine at an impressive rate.  Eventually the waiter returned to take their order—and to save them from their stilted conversation.

“I’ll have the filet mignon,” Steffi ordered, finally letting out a strained smile directed toward Nate.

“Wagyu, perhaps?” the waiter inquired.

“Yes.  That actually sounds perfect.”  As she opted for the expensive meal, her difficult smile toward Nate turned into a smirk.

“Excellent choice,” the waiter said and subsequently looked over to Nate.

“And I’ll have the side salad,” he joked to the waiter.

It provoked genuine laughter from her and for the first time that night she felt somewhat at ease.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

Steffi and Nate walked by the bar area as they were making their way out of the restaurant.

“Steffi?”

Confused, she turned to the unfamiliar voice calling her name.  Once they made eye contact, she recognized who it was.  “Yahira?”

They exchanged a warm and friendly greeting before they introduced Nate and Christian to each other.

“I missed you at my housewarming party,” Steffi went on with the small talk.

Yahira casually apologized for missing it.  That prompted Christian to look at Yahira with a very puzzled look.

“Oh my gosh,” Steffi exclaimed, “I love your bag!  I’ve seen this one.”

The men looked at each other with wordless bewilderment as the women gushed about the expensive accessory.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

Back at home, Steffi thought some more about the chance encounter at the restaurant.  She was fixated on Yahira’s designer handbag.  For some reason, she kept assuming Mark bought it for her.  On a whim, she decided to text him and have a little fun teasing him.

Steffi: *“I saw your cute coworker and her husband at Santana Plaza tonight.”*

Mark: *“Oh yeah?”*

Steffi: *“She was carrying my favorite Chanel bag.”*

Mark: *“Ok…”*

Steffi: *“I don’t suppose you bought it for her?”*

She eagerly awaited his reply as she stared at the flashing three dots.  Then the dots disappeared.

Hearing Nate come out of the bathroom, she silenced and put down her phone.  He looked at her lustfully, approached her, and they fully embraced each other for a deep kiss.

Her phone silently buzzed with Mark’s reply, but it would be a while before she noticed it.",2,1728392403.0,paypigsupportgroup,1,1.0,False
1fyz737,https://www.reddit.com/r/freeze_stories/comments/1fyz737/creepy_pasta_post_1/,creepy pasta post 1,"My neighbor has been too friendly lately..

I had been working late again, something I’d grown used to over the past few months. Chicago never truly sleeps, and it was common to see people still moving around the streets, even as the clock ticked past midnight. My apartment was just a few blocks away, and I’d made this walk home more times than I could count. The night was cool, the streetlights buzzing softly overhead as I made my way down the familiar route.

There wasn’t much traffic, which was typical for this time of night. The occasional car would pass, and sometimes I could hear the distant hum of the L train. I checked my phone out of habit, scrolling through notifications without really paying attention to them. A message from a friend asking about plans for the weekend, a reminder about a bill due tomorrow . Just the usual.

As I approached my building, I noticed Tom, my neighbor, outside by the garbage bins. He had a cigarette between his fingers, the glow lighting up his face briefly as he nodded in my direction.

“Burning the midnight oil again?” he asked.

“Yeah, work’s been crazy lately,” I replied, pausing for a moment before heading toward the door. “You?”

“Couldn’t sleep,” he said, shrugging. “Figured I’d step out for a bit.”

I nodded, pushing the front door open. “See you around.”

“Take it easy,” Tom replied before I disappeared inside.

The elevator was sluggish as usual, and I found myself staring at the scratched-up panel of buttons. I lived on the fourth floor, and as the elevator crept upward, I glanced back at my phone. More notifications, more things to deal with tomorrow.

When the elevator doors finally opened, I stepped into the quiet hallway. My apartment was at the far end, and I could see a faint light coming from under my door .  I must have left the lamp on when I left earlier. Not unusual. I always forgot little things like that.

But when I reached my door, something caught my attention. The door wasn’t closed all the way. It was barely noticeable, just a fraction of an inch, but it was enough to make me stop. I didn’t remember leaving it like that. I stood there for a moment, staring at the door, my hand hovering just above the knob.

I reached for the door, but as I grasped the knob, I froze. The door was unlocked. I was sure I had locked it before leaving, as I always did. I stood there, staring at the knob, trying to make sense of it. Maybe I had been in such a hurry earlier that I forgot. But no, I distinctly remembered the click of the lock as I left.

A knot tightened in my stomach as I pushed the door open. The apartment was quiet, everything seemingly in its place. The small lamp in the living room cast a soft glow, illuminating the familiar surroundings. I stepped inside and locked the door behind me, twisting the lock back and forth as if to reassure myself that it was working properly.

I walked into the living room, tossing my keys onto the counter, and that’s when I saw it. Lying on the coffee table, where nothing had been earlier, was a photograph. My breath caught in my throat. I didn’t remember leaving it there, and more importantly, I didn’t own any printed photos.

I stepped closer, my heart thudding in my chest. The photo was of me. Taken earlier today, on my walk from work. I recognized the street, the same one I had walked down just hours ago. My hand trembled as I picked it up, flipping it over to see if there was anything written on the back. There wasn’t.

Whoever took this photo had been watching me. They had followed me, and now they had been inside my apartment.

I felt a rush of adrenaline, my mind racing with questions. How did they get in? Had I really left the door unlocked? I didn’t think so. I quickly scanned the room again, looking for anything else that might have been moved, but everything seemed in place. I checked the windows, but they were locked too.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket, startling me. I pulled it out, half expecting to see a message from the stalker, but it was just Tom, my neighbor.

“Hey, you okay? You looked kind of off earlier,” his message read.

I stared at the screen, my thoughts too scattered to reply right away. Tom had been outside when I came home. Could he have noticed something? Should I tell him about the photo?

I hesitated for a moment, staring at Tom’s message. Should I tell him about the photo? Part of me wanted to confide in someone, but another part felt like I needed to keep it to myself, at least for now. I didn’t know what I was dealing with, and jumping to conclusions didn’t feel right.

After a long pause, I typed out a quick reply: “Yeah, just a rough day at work. Thanks for checking in.”

I put my phone down, running my hand through my hair as I tried to steady my breathing. The photo still sat on the table, taunting me. My mind raced, thinking through all the possibilities. Who had taken it? Why leave it here? How did they get in?

Trying to distract myself, I turned on the TV, hoping that some background noise would help calm my nerves. But I couldn’t focus. My thoughts kept circling back to the unlocked door and the photo. It was almost like someone wanted me to know I was being watched . Someone who knew I’d come home tonight and find their little message.

I stood up and walked around the apartment, checking the windows again, though I knew they were already locked. My eyes wandered over every corner of the room, looking for anything else out of place. Nothing. Just that photo.

The buzz of my phone startled me again. Another message from Tom.

“If you need anything, let me know. I’m up for a while.”

I stared at the message, feeling uneasy. Tom had always been friendly, but now it seemed like he was paying extra attention. I hadn’t noticed it before, but maybe I had never looked for it. Was I overthinking things? Or was it just a coincidence that he was always nearby, always checking in at the right time?

I didn’t respond to his message. Instead, I paced the room, glancing at the clock. It was past midnight now, and sleep felt impossible. My mind kept going over the day, trying to remember if I had seen anyone suspicious, anyone who might have followed me.

Suddenly, a soft knock came at the door.

The knock at the door sent a jolt through my body. I wasn’t expecting anyone at this hour. I hesitated, my heart pounding in my chest as I tiptoed toward the peephole. It was Tom, standing there with his hands in his pockets, looking casual. For a brief second, I felt relieved. Then, I remembered the photo on the coffee table and the unlocked door. My nerves tightened again.

I opened the door just a crack, trying to keep my voice steady. “Hey, what’s up?”

Tom smiled, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Sorry to bother you. I thought I heard something strange, like someone messing with your door earlier. Just wanted to check in, make sure you’re okay.”

I blinked, trying to process what he was saying. “You heard someone?”

“Yeah, probably just some drunk or something, but it didn’t seem right,” Tom continued, his eyes flicking past me into the apartment. “Thought I’d make sure everything was cool.”

My hand gripped the edge of the door tighter. I wasn’t sure what to make of this. Tom had always been friendly, but the timing of his concern felt off. And if he had really heard something, why hadn’t he called me or knocked earlier?

“I’m fine,” I said quickly, trying to close the door a bit more. “Thanks for checking in.”

Tom’s smile faltered just a bit. “Okay, well… just let me know if you need anything.”

I nodded, forcing a smile before closing the door fully and locking it. As soon as I was alone again, I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. Something about the whole situation didn’t sit right with me. I glanced back at the photo on the table, the reminder of someone having been inside, watching me.

My phone buzzed again, and I nearly jumped. Another message from Tom.

“Sorry if I freaked you out. Just being a good neighbor.”

I stared at the message, feeling my skin crawl. He was being too attentive, too involved. It was hard not to connect the dots. First the unlocked door, then the photo, and now Tom always seeming to be around at the perfect moment. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he knew more than he was letting on.

I decided I needed to talk to someone, so I called my friend Sarah. As the phone rang, I paced around the living room, my mind still racing. When she finally answered, her voice was groggy.

“Hey… everything okay?” she asked, clearly half-asleep.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “Something weird’s been happening. Someone was in my apartment earlier, I think. They left a photo of me from today.”

There was a pause on the other end before Sarah spoke again. “That’s creepy. Did you call the police?”

“I’m not sure what to tell them.. and I…” I stopped mid-sentence, glancing at the coffee table again, where the photo still sat. It felt like it was staring back at me, an eerie reminder that someone had been close enough to take it. “I don’t even know what to say. What if they think I’m just overreacting?”

Sarah’s voice grew more alert. “You’re not overreacting. Someone took a photo of you and left it in your apartment. That’s serious. You need to call them.”

I bit my lip, considering it. “Maybe you’re right. But… it’s just so bizarre. And Tom keeps checking on me. It’s like he knows something, but I don’t know if I’m being paranoid.”

“Wait, Tom?” Sarah asked, confused. “Your neighbor?”

“Yeah,” I said, lowering my voice even though I was alone. “He’s been around every time something weird happens. He texted me just after I found the photo, said he saw someone hanging around my door. It’s almost like he’s watching me.”

“Okay, that’s weird. Do you think he could be involved?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted, glancing nervously at the front door. “He’s always been friendly, but now it feels… off. I don’t know what to think.”

Sarah sighed. “Look, I really think you should call the police. Even if it’s nothing, better safe than sorry. And maybe keep your distance from Tom for a bit. Just in case.”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. “Yeah, maybe I’ll do that. Thanks, Sarah.”

“Stay safe, okay?” she said, her voice a little softer now. “Call me if you need anything.”

After hanging up with Sarah, I sat in the silence for a long moment… but she was right. It was better to be safe than sorry.

I dialed the non-emergency number, feeling a wave of anxiety wash over me as I waited for them to pick up. When I finally spoke, my voice sounded smaller than I intended.

“I’d like to report something suspicious,” I said, trying to keep my tone steady. “I think someone’s been watching me… and maybe even inside my apartment.”

The dispatcher took down my information, asking for the details of what had happened with the photos and the sounds outside my door. I tried my best to explain, though it felt surreal even as the words left my mouth. By the time the call ended, they assured me that an officer would be dispatched to check things out.

It wasn’t long before I heard the knock at the door. My heart jumped, but when I checked the peephole, I saw the distinct navy-blue uniforms of two police officers standing just outside. Taking a deep breath, I opened the door and let them inside.

One of the officers, a tall man with tired eyes, introduced himself. “Ma’am, we’re here to follow up on your report. Mind if we ask a few questions?”

I nodded, still feeling uneasy despite their presence. I led them into the living room, where they asked me to go over the events again in more detail. As I described the photos, the unlocked door, and the eerie feeling that I was being followed, the officer took notes, his partner occasionally glancing around the apartment.

“Have you noticed anyone suspicious hanging around recently?” the officer asked.

I hesitated. “There’s my neighbor, Tom. He’s been really helpful, but… I don’t know. It’s just a feeling. He’s always around, checking on me, and it seems a little too convenient.”

The officer nodded, his expression unreadable. “We’ll talk to him. Just to cover all the bases.”

After I finished explaining everything, they went down the hall to speak with Tom. I stayed inside, pacing nervously, listening to the muffled conversation through the door. It wasn’t long before the officers returned.

“Your neighbor says he hasn’t noticed anything unusual, but he’s concerned for your safety,” the officer said, his voice calm. “He offered to keep an eye out for anything strange.”

I nodded, not sure if that made me feel better or worse.

“Look, we don’t have enough for a full investigation right now,” the officer continued, “but we’ll keep a patrol car parked outside tonight, just in case. You should try to get some rest.”

I thanked them, feeling a slight sense of relief at the idea of police nearby. Maybe now, with someone watching over the apartment, I could get some rest.

I couldn’t sleep. The events of the night replayed in my mind, the unsettling photos, the noises outside my door, and Tom’s messages. The fear settled in deep, keeping me alert, despite the police being outside. I stayed up all night, jumping at every creak in the apartment, every distant sound from the street. The small knife I had tucked into my bag for protection felt like my only source of comfort as dawn finally broke.

The next day passed in a haze of routine, but the weight of the previous night’s fear lingered at the back of my mind. I went through my workday mechanically, my body tired but my thoughts racing. By the time I finished my shift, the sky had already darkened, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that had settled over me.

As I made my way home, I decided to stop by the convenience store a few blocks from my apartment. I needed something to help me unwind, maybe a snack and a drink to go with the movie I’d planned to watch. The store was brightly lit, a small beacon of normalcy amidst the growing shadows of the evening.

I walked inside, the sound of the automatic doors hissing as they slid open. Grabbing a soda and a bag of chips, I wandered toward the counter, trying to shake the nerves that still clung to me.

The cold night air felt sharp against my skin as I left the convenience store, clutching the plastic bag of snacks. Ever since I found those photos in my apartment, my nerves had been on edge. I kept one hand near the knife in my jacket pocket as I walked quickly through the dimly lit parking lot. Something didn’t feel right, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.

The parking lot felt unnervingly still, the flickering streetlights casting long, distorted shadows over the scattered cars. The silence pressed in around me, broken only by the faint hum of the lights overhead. I quickened my pace, the sound of my own footsteps loud and uneven. My breath hitched, and I glanced back, expecting to see someone behind me, but there was no one.

My heart pounded harder, every instinct screaming at me to move faster. The shadows felt like they were closing in, stretching farther across the pavement as I hurried toward the far end of the lot. I tried to tell myself it was just paranoia, just the leftover fear from the night before .

Then, everything went dark. A bag was yanked over my head with brutal force, and strong arms wrapped around my throat, squeezing tight. Panic surged through me as I thrashed wildly, trying to scream, but the sound was muffled by the bag, my voice trapped inside. My lungs burned, desperate for air, but each breath came in shallow, choking gasps.

The grip around my throat tightened, and my vision started to blur. My legs kicked out violently, but I couldn’t break free. Every muscle in my body screamed for oxygen, for a way out, but the world around me was fading, slipping into darkness. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think.

My hand fumbled toward my pocket, feeling the cold steel of the knife. With the last ounce of strength I had left, I yanked it free and swung blindly behind me. I felt the blade hit flesh, and a low grunt of pain followed. The grip on my throat loosened just enough for me to rip the bag from my head.

I gasped for air, stumbling forward, vision swimming as I tried to regain my balance. My entire body trembled with fear and adrenaline, but I forced myself to turn around. He stood there, hunched over, clutching his side where I had slashed him. Blood poured between his fingers, staining the pavement beneath him, but his eyes… his eyes were locked on me with a burning hatred.

""Who are you?""I rasped, my voice shaking, barely able to speak.

His twisted grin sent a shiver down my spine. ""You don’t remember me?"" he said, his voice low, full of contempt. ""Of course you don’t.""

I stared at him, struggling to place his face. There was something familiar about him, but it was like grasping at a half-forgotten memory.

""You think you’re so much better than me,"" he hissed, taking a shaky step forward despite the wound.

""You never even looked at me back then. You laughed, like I didn’t matter.""

The memory hit me like a cold wave. High school. He had been there, always lurking in the background, quiet, unassuming . Someone I had barely noticed. I swallowed hard, dread settling deep in my chest.

""You,"" I whispered, feeling a rising sense of horror. ""I barely remember you.""

“You rejected me, like I was nothing."" He took another step, his breath ragged. ""But I swore you’d pay for it one day.""

My pulse raced as his words sank in. This wasn’t just some random attack. He had planned this. He had been waiting for this moment, fueled by a hatred I hadn’t even known existed.

""I didn’t want your love,"" he said, his voice trembling with anger. ""I wanted you to feel what it’s like to be nothing. To feel hunted. To feel powerless.""

I backed away, my heart pounding against my chest. ""I don’t understand,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""That was years ago.""

His face contorted with rage. ""You thought you could laugh at me and walk away. But I’ve been waiting. I’ve been waiting all this time to make you suffer.""

His legs gave out, and he collapsed to the ground, blood pooling beneath him as his breath came in shallow gasps. I stood there, paralyzed, watching him struggle to breathe, trying to comprehend the nightmare that had unfolded in front of me. A boy I barely remembered from my past had plotted his revenge for years, and now he had come for me.

Then, I heard it . The soft chime of a text message.

My pulse quickened as I looked down at his limp body. His phone must have gone off. My hands shook as I crouched down, reaching toward his jacket pocket. For a moment, I hesitated, but then I forced my hand inside.

I pulled out his phone, the screen still glowing with a new notification.

The message read: ""Did you get the job done?""

I opened the conversation and what I saw made my blood freeze .

There were photos of me : walking to work, leaving my apartment, moving through my daily life. He

had been watching me for weeks, maybe longer. Each photo was sent to him with a chilling, calculated precision.

My breath came in short, panicked gasps as I scrolled up further. The stalker had been communicating with someone else, someone who had been helping him all along. My blood ran cold as I read through the exchange.

""Make sure she finds the pictures.""

""Tonight’s the night. I’m going to finish this.""

Then came the reply from earlier that night: ""I don’t care what you do, as long as I get paid.""

With growing terror, I pulled out my own phone and compared the unknown number to my contacts. My hands shook violently as I scrolled through my list, praying I was wrong. But when I saw the match, my heart plummeted.

It was Tom...

A wave of nausea hit me as the realization set in. Tom, the friendly neighbor who had always been so concerned, so helpful, had been involved from the beginning. He had been feeding information to my stalker, planting the photos, manipulating me . All for money.

I felt numb as I dialed the police, my voice shaking as I tried to explain everything. Tom had betrayed me in the worst possible way, and I had never even suspected him.

It didn’t take long. A knock at Tom’s door echoed through the hallway, louder than I’d ever heard before. I stepped out into the corridor, standing in the shadows as the police spoke to him. I held my breath as I watched the scene unfold.

Tom opened the door, calm as ever, his face the picture of confusion. ""What’s going on?"" he asked, his voice dripping with faux innocence.

They moved swiftly, stepping inside. Within moments, Tom was in handcuffs, his calm facade cracking ever so slightly. His eyes locked onto mine, just for a second, as they led him past me down the hallway.

""You were always so easy to fool,"" he said, his voice low, cold, and with a grim smirk on his face.

How could I have been so blind? He had been right there, pretending to care, pulling the strings the entire time.

As I sat in my apartment, alone and shaken, I realized how close I had come to losing everything . Not just my life, but my sense of trust. I thought I had known who the real danger was, but the truth had been right in front of me the whole time, hidden behind a [neighbor’s smile].

I love the energy, curiosity, open-mindedness and enthusiasm of younger women. There is something incredibly sexy about a younger woman who craves new experiences and who is open to experimentation and who approaches it all with a positive attitude.

I am so glad there are younger women out there who crave an older experienced man…I have found that everyone of them I have spoken to love that an older man is interested in ""her"" pleasure as much as he is interested in his own -- Apparently younger men are more focused on themselves.

So thank you to all of you fabulous younger ladies out there!😛

That said…I am a fun, discreet, married, educated, tasteful and attractive silver-fox gentleman who wants to intimately explore with you. I prefer soft and sensual over rough, but I find it arousing when my partner likes to have her hair pulled and to be used more rough when our collective passion builds;) I want you to feel safe, cared for, desired, excited, and satisfied. I am tall, slim, fit, hairy chest, nice equipment, and I have a warm, wet, savage tongue.

I am just wanting some fun conversation and to hear the sweet noises you make when we play…and when I make you cum. I promise that I will leave you feeling sexy all over and with no regrets. It will be our sexy secret🤫

1fyz4lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebrityweightlose/comments/1fyz4lq/fitspresso_the_coffee_revolutionizing_health_for/,Fitspresso: The Coffee Revolutionizing Health for Busy Americans,"Once upon a time, in the fast-paced world of corporate America, John, a New Yorker, like so many, was juggling work and fitness with a cup of coffee in hand. But over time, that same coffee began to betray him. The quick energy highs were followed by unbearable crashes, leaving him drained and jittery. Coffee had once been his ally, but now, it was holding him back from reaching his full potential at work and in the gym.

Enter Fitspresso, a revolutionary coffee blend designed for people like John. It wasn’t just coffee anymore; it was a new approach to energizing his day and improving his overall well-being. Fitspresso promised to deliver the same familiar, rich taste of coffee but with benefits far beyond what John had ever expected. It had a blend of green tea extract for boosting metabolism, Garcinia Cambogia to help with weight loss, and B vitamins to provide long-lasting energy without the dreaded crash. Even better, it included L-Theanine, a compound known for its calming effects, helping John maintain focus without the anxiety that often came with deadlines.

[Fitspresso](https://preview.redd.it/0ugtj9qg3itd1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=42dc20b4b2c6aa11579154a7fd82e2207d514261)

Curious, John decided to give it a shot. One brisk autumn morning, he brewed his first cup. The smell was familiar, but the experience was different. The taste? Smooth, bold, and somehow more indulgent. John felt energized, but it wasn’t the usual short-lived buzz. Hours passed, and he noticed he was still going strong—no crash in sight. At work, he powered through meetings with a laser focus. The brain fog that usually crept in by lunch was gone, and even his mood was lighter. Anxiety? Hardly there.

As days turned into weeks, the transformation became even more evident. His workouts were more intense, and for the first time in a while, he was actually seeing results. Fitspresso not only boosted his energy but also curbed his cravings, which made managing his diet easier. The weight he had struggled to shed for years finally started coming off. But it wasn’t just John feeling the benefits.

Sarah, a busy mom from California, had her own story. Between raising two kids and trying to stay fit, her days were filled with chaos. Finding time for herself was a challenge, and she often felt drained by midday. But after discovering Fitspresso through an online fitness group, Sarah noticed an immediate shift. She had more energy, more focus, and, surprisingly, a calmer state of mind. Juggling her daily responsibilities became more manageable, and for the first time in a while, she felt like she was in control.

Then there was Michael, a fitness enthusiast from Texas. For him, Fitspresso became a game-changer in his workout routine. He had tried other pre-workout supplements before, but they always left him feeling jittery or, worse, drained after the session. Fitspresso, however, gave him that steady energy boost he needed to push through intense workouts, without the crash. It fit right into his daily routine and helped him stay on track with his weight management goals.

The beauty of Fitspresso? It wasn’t just another supplement that required strict diets or drastic lifestyle changes. It fit seamlessly into the lives of John, Sarah, and Michael—just by replacing their regular coffee with a healthier alternative. And while they all had different goals—whether it was better focus at work, staying energized for their kids, or crushing it in the gym—Fitspresso helped them achieve those goals.

It wasn’t long before the Fitspresso craze began spreading, first in New York, then across the United States. People were talking about it in gyms, at work, and online communities. The key to its success wasn’t just in the ingredients, though that certainly played a big part. It was the way Fitspresso made people feel—energized, focused, and ready to take on the day, whatever that day looked like.

For those looking for a simple, effective way to enhance their health while still enjoying their favorite daily ritual, Fitspresso became the perfect solution. Whether you’re a busy professional like John, a mom like Sarah, or a fitness enthusiast like Michael, Fitspresso’s promise of sustained energy, mental clarity, and physical improvement was hard to ignore. **Want To Try FitSpresso?** **Visit the official FitSpresso Coffee Loophole store :** [https://fitspresso.com/](https://freezegluco.com/fitspresso.html)

To be clear although unfortunate as it was if my hardships made things easier for others than perhaps it was fine.","This would be the Separation Statement that Ill be leaving when I'm able at least. the first couple of attempts to email it failed so I ended up sending it to Ethics and Compliance due to some of the events that had passed. I've seen some pretty wild stories on here so I hope yall enjoy and this one stacks up there with them.   

  
Also all names were left out or changed for privacy purposes

  
To be clear ahead of time. I don't disagree with the choice of separation for reasons varying from unsatisfactory work performance to unintentional poor rapport with staff. I do want some details cleared up though as well as brought to light due to the impactful nature of my time employed and the duress associated with it. I would also appreciate a response on the merit of reapplying to any of the local stores. I do believe the issue of tardiness could have been easily remedied by putting me into shifts later in the day even at 10AM and later should have guaranteed a regular punctuality. Additionally my initial couple of tardiness records would have also been easily remedied with a notice of what is considered too early or late for punch-in, moreso the too early as well as the using breaks for toiletings. Post this becoming an issue I did go to the lengths of purchasing adult diapers as well as making sure to see that staff wouldn't be upset by anytime I did need to use the toilet. The combination of my medication and getting used to the coffee had my stomach transitioning. I truly did my best to bring 100% of myself to every shift and couldn't have provided more in the way of effort as I did enjoy my employment despite the hardships faced. I will link with this PDF Files to fill in further details as well as evidence from conversations with other staff attesting to the actions that took place. I will try to give a brief summary of all of this and any details I believe could prove helpful, but hope the conversations with others will provide details enough to merit investigation.      I started work as an ssv and had a wonderful training as a barista and had an equally enjoyable training as an ssv although admittedly I did find the training much more sparse and with much confusion to the expectations in how much directioning to give staff and what the specific store's staff were accustomed to. This led to some discourse with staff and a general poor rapport. Following this I did try and connect with staff outside of work eating out at a restaurant though was left to an end abruptly after having talked about opinions of staff positive and negative though the attention seemed to be on the negative. I believe I may have hurt feelings or left them feeling overplayed with their hand speaking where I had little info to work with on my thoughts of others and gave some very basic correlations that could be seen in human psychology and what I'd observed with others. After this night rapport seemed to fall off more expediently. In addition, communication became almost non-existent. This led to other forms of passive aggression as well but the general group mentality seemed to continue this almost alienation/ostracizing like behaviour. Certainly the mechanics of dealing with people can be machiavellian, but there's little I can do when left in a position of no information. I did try my best to make lemonade from the lemons as the phrase goes though. I did plead with management to assist with the passive aggression and bullying however no solution seemed to be found other than letting me go of which I'd even advised at a couple points. Due to this I'm inclined to file with the EEOC in regard to discrimination of disability. I really would have rather handled this in a less disruptive manner and gave the attempt to. There was one night amongst my employment in which I had a medication error causing me to black out and need directioning akin to a toddler at least per report from others as I still do not remember that night. during that night I had apparently unplugged the phone line. This scared some of the staff it seemed and was the cause for the Assistant Store Manager to come to the store armed with a firearm the following night in case I had showed up (I was not scheduled).This causing quite a high degree of tension both in myself and safety but also it seemed a lot of discourse between staff. Since then the relations with this manager seemed without repair, though not without trying as I did go and speak with many of the partners about the night to make sure no one felt uncomfortable. Hopefully this serves as a decent enough update to the events in my time of employment and you're able to find some benefit from it as I truthfully have little hope this changes much to the likelihood of re-employment. Again though I would appreciate some kind of a response whether it would merit the effort as I did enjoy working for the company as a whole.I would like to add that the journal entries added are purposefully written in ""chicken scratch"" for confidential purposes. I'd be happy to decipher anything that is unreadable.I should also have audio/video journals that could be referenced.

P.S. while writing this on my laptop I had a partner come sit next to me in the cafe who was belittled by other partners. i.e. ""what're you gonna go play chess with him."" I hope you're able to address this blatant poor behaviour.",1,1728391684.0,starbucks,2,1.0,False

But I’ve been reflecting on the end of a 20+ year friendship that I haven’t fully processed.

My former best friend, let’s call her Mary, and I met when we were four and stayed close until my mid-twenties. We came from very different backgrounds—her family struggled financially, and she had a rough time finding her path, while I was fortunate to have my parents’ support, which allowed me to pursue higher education and establish a stable career. As I started to progress in life, I noticed a shift between us. Mary would make little passive-aggressive comments, and it became clear that as I achieved more, there was growing tension.

Around this time, her life choices also became concerning. She started dating men who were already married and seemed to normalize behaviors I couldn’t align with. It was disheartening, and I realized that our values were drifting apart. Then, she met someone online and, within a week, proposed to him and began planning a lavish wedding, financed by high-interest loans. The entire experience was an eye-opener for me. She expected everyone to drop everything to cater to her wedding, yet when I got married, she barely made an effort to reciprocate. It made me take a closer look at our friendship, and I saw how one-sided it had become.

I decided to stop reaching out after her wedding, hoping maybe she’d notice and make an effort. But she didn’t. It’s been 10 years, and we haven’t spoken since. What strikes me as odd is that she still follows me on social media and watches all my stories but never engages.

Looking back, I know I’ve worked hard to build the life I have, and it’s become clear that keeping her in my life would have held me back. Our values no longer align, and I don’t miss the chaos that seemed to follow her. But I’ll admit, I sometimes miss the connection we had when we were younger—or maybe I just miss the idea of having a best friend. Still, I can’t help but wonder if she’ll ever reach out, even if just for a simple coffee.

Although traders were certainly bearish on the day yesterday and have not yet begun to unwind their bearish positions, our price action, technicals, and options data suggest we may be in store for a small bullish reversal inside the 10/18 OPEX time frame before our larger potential bullish breakout thereafter. Let's take a look at the data and see what we can see!

**Price Movement Recap**

Yesterday was the day we thought it was gonna be - continued retracement to the middle of our 50-day and 200-day SMA trading channel. Our $21 large net negative gamma position drew us down into the $21-$20.50 where we closed and are now sitting premarket:

[10\/8 Trading Day 1-min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/8bb84vgcsitd1.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ae0816f786591d79d3f52423d3c5de6e6c3a2f0)

Our AM trading session was defined by a steeper list downward which set up some quick intraday trades off the lower VWAP line (-1 Standard Deviation/Σ), while our afternoon session saw some quiet recovery with bearish intraday trades off VWAP itself. Our daily low of $20.84 was touched after some pretty sizable bearish trades (short $15 Calls for January) came in which was then countermanded by a series of larger bullish orders on the day:

https://preview.redd.it/3ogdlgcotitd1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3563879b66ee28b0a143f0790b0814a64b9401a

Overall, however, net flows were decidedly shifted toward a bearish imbalance as traders looked to capitalize on this pretty obvious downside volatility.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

[10\/11 OI Changes 10\/7-10\/8](https://preview.redd.it/1e4yc2ecuitd1.png?width=1852&format=png&auto=webp&s=93493d1776459e4c9ca5dd5bd59598a1c401252d)

OI was quite substantially in favor of new calls for 10/11, though as we saw from the Options premium imbalance, they were largely calls sold short. This has moved our 10/11 options Max Pain down from $21.50 to $21. Max Pain for 10/18 OPEX still sits at $20. Put buyers did not expand their positions by any meaningful amount yesterday, but neither have they yet begun to close on their profits. This indicates that bears are still looking for some continued downside, even if it is modest, in light of the aforementioned data.

[10\/18 OPEX OI Changes 10\/7-10\/8](https://preview.redd.it/h3kudtbsuitd1.png?width=1855&format=png&auto=webp&s=b38fe336c7161ca652f1e212a6b5e78714061164)

New OI for October OPEX was modest, but did feature a sizable expansion in call OI (+2000) at the $20.50 strike. Weirdly, absolutely all of the volume at this strike came through within the span of a couple minutes with about 1000 calls being sold short by one trader and another 1000 bought at the Ask by another. This has the effect of maintaining $20.50 as a slightly gamma net positive position during this week's trading and sustaining it as such into next week for the time being.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/du84k4gswitd1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=54a2a76f31c4da7c8546747d03cfb5e35071a4f3

Our current gamma exposure landscape suggests that any major downside volatility is tapped out at this point, though some slow, grindy downward action is still possible on the approach to $20. $20 and $20.50 together form a very large total gamma exposure position which slow downward price action below $21. This effect in part explains why intraday trading only penetrated to new lows beneath $21 a few pennies at a time, while the moves toward $21 from above were much quicker and more dynamic.

$21 itself has softened in terms of its net negative gamma exposure character without changing the nature of the strike overall. While the price remains below $21, any upward price action will occur dynamically and quickly as MMs hedge their positions in sympathy with options activity on all approaches to the position. As $21 disappears as a gamma net negative position after this week's options expiry, traders may try to use this net negative position on a bullish move this week to quickly and easily push the price up to somewhere between $21.50 and $22 using $22 as a Call Wall overhead for functional bearish reversal and the 50-day SMA as a chart signal for the same. They may wait until later in the week to trigger this move in order to allow IV levels to grind down and maximize profit on prospective delta value appreciation off long calls.

**Technicals**

[7\/16-9\/19 1-Day Aggregation with Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/rd0ys7lvyitd1.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4453e39df03cc356b2b82dfc5fa2d7e21dcec5e)

[7\/16-10\/7 1-Day Aggregation Actual](https://preview.redd.it/4754sbzqyitd1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=a43eed47d690739401c44e47fa54eed9455dcf6c)

As we take a look once again at our technicals, we still observe our 50-day and 200-day moving averages converging on one another with the 50-day SMA now resting at $21.84. As we observe our candle sequence, we can we already have logged five lower closes in a row - GME has not logged 6 in a row since before the May Sneeze (but of course historical results do not predict future performance). Our RSI looks like it has another day or two to lower before setting itself up for a mild reversal within our current trading paradigm - a bullish move that would reverse back down into a neutral-bearish state at around the 50-day SMA. This small reversal may give traders another opportunity to profit off mild 'wiggle' in our paradigm both in terms of IV and of the price of the underlying.

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean IV 10\/7](https://preview.redd.it/occb93600jtd1.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fa99cea0237b4a1975ab386d32c6ced3d675889)

Yesterday's IV behavior was somewhat strange. At open, IV dropped nearly six (6) percentage points from 90% to 84% before trending up for the remainder of the day despite our gentle price action and lower close. Why exactly something like this would happen is a bit of querula. In any case, IV still closed yesterday lower than Friday's levels, namely at 87%. If our price continues to stay low and trade sideways, IV will continue its downward trend.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Put holders still have not cashed out of their bearish trades despite our continued observance of downside reversal yesterday. This suggests they still anticipate some manner of continued downside reversal. However, beneath $21 - and even at $21 - positive MM gamma exposure is accumulating, adding resistance to the effects of continued downside price action into the very large total gamma position at $20. This may establish and enable toward the end of the week - possibly sooner - the potential for a small bullish reversal triggered off options activity which culminates and between $21.50 and $22 as the coincidence of our nearest Call Wall overhead and our technical overhead of the 50-day Simple Moving Average.

Good luck out there!

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

Everything was going great and we were very happy, but recently we started having some issues. We are not having a wedding ceremony, mainly because we want to start having children soon and don't want to spend that kind of money (both of our families live abroad so it would be very expensive to fly everyone out) and reserve it for our down payment on our house. We decided to buy a house together and after that get legally married and start our family once we get settled. This is where the issues came.

I come from a family of farmers (the fruits and vegetables kind not the animal type) from both sides of my family but my parents are not farmers. My dream has always been to have a farm, for personal use, not as a job but my fiancee doesn't want that and i accepted that. However, one thing that is non-negotiable for me are my chickens. I have 10 chickens and he knows that, so when house hunting i was looking for a house with a decent backyard to be able to raise them freely as they do in the house im renting for now.

He started getting distant and avoiding me after i told him i planned to bring my chickens to our new house but i didnt put two and two together until l asked him a week later. After a week of being avoided I decided to go to his house to talk things out this past Saturday . I asked him what was wrong with him he said that he thought i would get rid of my chickens before moving together and that's why he was putting up with it, but that he didn't want chickens in our house and that it was making him reconsider our relationship, because, his words, “he didn’t want someone who came with package” and then asked me to get rid of my chicken . This made me extremely angry and I admit that I lost it, I started hysterically crying and told him that my chicken were more important to me than our relationship (not true at all, I said this without thinking in a state of panic) so if he was not willing accept that my chicken are coming with me then we were done. I got in my car and went home, where I spent the whole day crying. He tried calling me, and I did not pick up because I didn’t want to say more things i didn’t mean, which I told him in a message. 

On Sunday I was feeling better and decided to call him and we agreed to meet for coffee that same afternoon to talk about it. I started by apologising about what I told him, and I told him it was not how I felt at all, to which he told me that he knew I didn’t mean it and that he didn’t hold it against me. I decided to be honest with him and told him about the farm thing, how it was my life dream and that it affected me not being able to have this when we could well afford it (we are both engineers and have decent salaries) and he wouldn’t need to do anything on it. I was honest about how I was not aware of the impact this had had on me until he asked me to get rid of my chickens (which, as weird as it may sound, I love like my own children), ultimately asking me to get rid of the last piece of my childhood dream, and how that just set me off. He said I was being selfish and that he needed some time to think because he was not sure if this is how he wanted his life to be from now on, which I accepted (though, being honest, I don’t understand)

I talked to my best friend about this and she told me to just give up the farm thing, insinuating I was in the wrong, but, I assume, not wanting to directly tell me.

Me and my fiancee have not talked after that, and I’m giving him the space to think about our situation.

Am I really in the wrong here? I genuinely do not understand why this is such a big deal and I feel like he really must not love me as much as I thought he did if he doesn’t want my dreams to come true and it’s eating me alive. Any advice is appreciated, but please don’t be too harsh.

I've been adding in things like kitchen scraps, eggshells, dead leaves and grass, coffee grounds, toilet paper rolls, etc into the compost, and I've been rotating it about 2-3 times a week. I've really been trying to keep it balanced in terms of green vs brown material, and when I open it to add things, I can definitely see decomposition. 

However I'm not really seeing any of the broken down material making its way into the second chamber in the tumbler. I know compost takes months to break down, but so far I am only seeing very tiny bits getting into the second chamber, like pieces of eggshell, or the odd seed or two from fruit/veg scraps previously added. I have been doing this since about April or May. I also live in the Caribbean so it's very humid and hot so I'm not sure how much this would impact it. 

I read somewhere online that it can take 8-10 months to fully turn into compost so I wanted to make sure that I'm on the right track. Would appreciate any advice or insights. Thanks! ",1,1728391030.0,composting,9,1.0,False

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/

“Its limited appearance in urine indicates that caffeine metabolism is the rate-limiting factor in its plasma clearance (Arnaud, 1993). Caffeine metabolism occurs primarily in the liver, catalyzed by hepatic microsomal enzyme systems (Grant et al., 1987). In healthy humans, repeated caffeine ingestion does not alter its absorption or metabolism (George et al., 1986). It is metabolized in the liver to dimethylxanthines, uric acids, di- and trimethylallantoin, and uracil derivatives. In humans 3-ethyl demethylation to paraxanthine is the primary route of metabolism (Arnaud, 1987). This first metabolic step accounts for approximately 75–80 percent of caffeine metabolism and involves cytochrome P4501A2 (Arnaud, 1993). Paraxanthine is the dominant metabolite in humans, rising in plasma to concentrations 10 times those of theophylline or theobromine. Caffeine is cleared more quickly than paraxanthine, so 8 to 10 hours after caffeine ingestion, paraxanthine levels exceed caffeine levels in plasma (Arnaud, 1993).”

My hunches are that since I have caffeine every morning and it’s needing to be cleared from plasma, so is uric acid and other natural substances. It also being metabolized into uric acid doesn’t help imo. 

This is just one factor I know but they all add up. I’ve already bought a thing of decaf and started mixing it into my ground coffee to start reducing caffeine and hopefully avoid headaches in the next few weeks. ",3,1728390814.0,gout,3,0.71,False

In my experience, observing my ""doings"" , thoughts, Emotions, in presence or reflection, i cannot truly say i have free will. 

To Put IT Point Blank, all decisions are based of Energy. Which Side of the scale weighs more Energy is what is being leaned towards. Either through the egoic mind that ist seeking fullfillment (mostly If Not all the time ignorance), or through the past experience of suffering. To give a very Basic example.

In the morning i choose Coffee over Coca Cola. I choose a fresh Date over a piece of cake. I used to Grab the Coke and cake, because my taste seemed to get the Most pleasure/fullfillment. I experienced suffering through constipation and illness in my childhood which later lead me to question why. Which shifted the Energy to a wiser decision leading to a healthier Lifestyle which avoids the pain of the past. 

Also decisions May BE repressed , also to avoids pain even though once again through ignorance, as sooner or later all must BE faced.

Every decision has the ultimate Goal of Peace so to speak. IT IS Like being in a maze of some sort, i bump into dead ends or dont know which way to Go based on some lifes challenges. I learn Not to make those decisions. but ultimately i never want the outcome to BE suffering in the First place. So there isnt really a decision maker or ""doer"" when i Look deep within.

The Mill District is both walking distance to downtown, UGA, Normaltown nightlife, the hospital, the Dudley Park and the Firefly, etc. Vitally, it's also new construction, which is a rare find in the Normaltown/New Town area. That means the place has been blissfully problem-free, and will continue to be for some time. No pests, no rot, no mold, everything works (as far as we know!); that's not the typical housing situation in this part of town, and it's a godsend for busy people who just want low-maintenance, low-stress convenience, not to deal with house problems. There is also ample on-site parking, solving another perennial challenge of living on the more settled streets of this area.

By far our favourite thing about this place has been the large, tall picture windows, and the amount of natural light the place admits. It lends a cheerful, optimistic mood to every day, gives one a sunny perch from which to observe the lively goings-on at the kiosks outside, but without blinding sunlight or excessive heat.

It's quite conveniently located, whether you're a Townie or in school, and is a nice, central location from which to conduct one's life in either direction of Prince. It is, of course, especially convenient for students; the logic of the layout lends itself well to splitting the two bedrooms, each having their own full bathroom, and a long hallway to separate them. A nice bonus are the small kiosk businesses located in the middle of the estate, including Sunroof Coffee and Dawg Day Frosé, among others. You're also a \~1-minute walk from Hidden Gem and Nighthawks, two of the best new additions to Athens nightlife; Nighthawks is actually part of the estate, and Hidden Gem is just across a lot.

Another benefit of subleasing from us is that our locked-in rental rate of $2,010/mo will apply to you. Because of their attractive location, 2 BR units for fresh move-ins for 2025 are on offer at $2,700/mo at the time of this writing.

Getting a lot of notifications from this sub and surprised to see some of the low doses people are on and the doses that many consider high. 

I’m in the titration period of Vyvanse in the UK. Started 30mg then to 50mg. About 6 weeks total so far. I mentioned to my provider that I felt the drug was having a positive impact (feel like more ‘good days’ of my pre-medicated self) But that I was still having some issues with task initiation / picking one task out of a list of many.

I also mentioned that if reintroduced a half coffee around 5 hours after taking my meds for an energy boost. This is about 1/6th of the caffeine I was ingesting before but he seems very anti getting dopamine from any other means such as coffee / sweets (candy) / biscuits (cookies) ‘it’s ok to have one’.

I have very brief 5-10 min phone convos with my prescriber and it all feels a bit rushed. He is very ready to prescribe higher doses and says most people end up on 60/70mg but what I’m reading on here has me wondering if we are doing too much too soon. 

I have 60mg pills in the post as well as 50s plus a 10mg dex booster. From what I’ve read 10mg Dex is also quite a large hit. 

Is it really better to go with larger doses of meds rather than a coffee top up? or should I just take them as a blessing and get on with trying them. 

Final point: in terms of how I feel on the drug, I tend to have waves of feeling the drug coming on, starting quite quickly and lasting around 2.5 hours after taking. These feel like highs of ‘coming up’ slightly and then lows of a small come down; some hard beating of my heart; Warm feeling in chest; feeling spells of talkativeness and feeling very happy and social that then gives way to a bit of an empty feeling.

Final final point: I may very well have been in a period of burnout when starting my meds (my lowest point lead me to go private instead of waiting for nhs) and I’ve heard burnout can make the meds less effective.

So my wife & I are researching and studying the market to open a shop that serves specialty coffee & some baked goodies that are freshly baked every day.

With a lot of research & asking few people around. We are looking for someone who is experienced or have some experience and can advise us on the following points below.. It will be much appreciated 🙏🏼:

- What is the most appropriate license to get for such a shop? 
- I have seen companies such as virtue zone & such that help you with it but with a fee included? Is that worth it? Or is the process straightforward that its better done by us?
- Considering that it is a start up business and the cost of baking equipments for the kitchen is quite a sum amount.. I have seen through research that some companies rent you the kitchen equipments? Is it worth it? Do you have any experience with such services?
- Lastly, where would you recommend us to search and look for staff (chef, waiters, baristas, etc)

Finally, I will keep this post running and updating you guys with each step so who ever can refer to it in the future in need 🙏🏼.

Can someone give me an idiot’s guide, cliff notes, key point intro of what Sharepoint is supposed to do or be?

They have eliminated our server in favor of this cloud-based solution. (Solution to what? Stuff worked before; now it doesn’t).

I have seen the phrase “lift and shift” on this sub and I think that may describe what happened here. 

There were too many items, so many were archived into a separate library. Everything else, MANY files & folders, our whole org, is now as it was before, but in sharepoint.

We (lowly employees) have expressed frustration. We have variously been told that sharepoint is great and can do so many things, and also that everything is exactly the same as it was before just cloud based.

We’re supposed to use shortcuts in file explorer so we can use all our usual processes etc, but also not use too many or too large of shortcuts because file syncing / performance may be impacted.

Throughout the day, our department emails lots of attachments both internally and externally. I occasionally use the time to refresh my coffee while my computer audibly whirrs and tries its hardest to retrieve files from the cloud, files it worked just as hard to save there just moments ago.

Any complaint is met with “but it’s exactly the same as it was before!” and references to being a team player or embracing technological solutions.  

I see the enthusiasm for sharepoint on this sub. I assume that microsoft did not create a product intended to function “exactly the same as you did before, but shittier”. 

But my knowledge gap between here and there is so vast I do not know how to begin, and internal training is proving not forthcoming.

I'm... actually unusually pleased with how this turned out. There were many points at which I was convinced I'd ruined it and was ready to throw it out the window, but I'm finally starting to come around to the fact that that's just kind of part of the creative process. 

The deets, for those masochistic enough to be curious: 

This is a 3/4in vegtan leather strap. I designed and 3D printed stamps for the decorative tabs and to use as a stencil for the detailing. Once I got the stamps where I wanted them, I was able to cut the design into the strap and begin the painstaking process of tooling it out. It was even more finicky than I'd anticipated, lol, and I ended up having to buy the tiniest damn tool I could find - 1.2mm. I do have a bit of experience in leatherworking, but not much in tooling specifically so that was definitely new for me. The design, I'm pretty sure, would be trivial for someone who knows what they're doing, but uh. I am not that, so it was not that. 

Everything was dyed with Angelus leather dyes, in a 1:1:50 ratio of Honey: Coffee: isopropyl alcohol. All edges on the straps and tabs were finished with sandpaper up to 1500 grit then burnished with beeswax, even though I'm pretty sure that was unnecessary for literally all parts of this lol. The tabs were sealed with neatsfoot oil and the strap was finished with resolene because the bottle was physically closer to me when I was doing that part and I didn't realize until the first coat was done. Sigh. 

I also started digging into metalworking a teeeeeny tiny bit, which is something I've been eager to do for ages. I found an [STL for the buckle](https://dangerousladies.ca/products/astarions-belt-buckles-3d-print-files?pr_prod_strat=pinned&pr_rec_id=7bf975e3a&pr_rec_pid=8662950805821&pr_ref_pid=8662641148221&pr_seq=uniform) (this shop is an embarrassment of riches, crafty folks - they even have machine embroidery files for Astarion’s armor if you, like me, aren't as talented as some who can do it by hand!) but I knew that painted resin just wasn't gonna be it for me. The weight was all wrong! So I got a lil tiny foundry, some high-temp silicone to cast molds into, and some pewter, and we made it happen. Eventually. This is a very persnickety process, as it turns out. Hopefully we'll continue to improve and I'll get to come here and show off some jewelry in a few months' time! 

The most interesting feature, I think, is that this belt expands! Video game characters are not beholden to physics, and vampires are not unduly concerned with weight fluctuations, which might be why the design of this belt doesn't have any godsdamned way to size it up or down. But it's being made for a human person who should be allowed to eat and breathe, so it needed to allow for at least a little wiggle room! Hidden inside of six of the eight tabs, the belt is actually cut and each end is stitched to a piece of heavy-duty elastic. Each one only allows for maybe half an inch of additional stretch, but spread over six of those tabs it actually has quite a bit of give! Hopefully that way it will still be comfy after a big meal, or when worn over a garment with more bulk to it. It's, uh. It's maybe not the most simple or efficient answer to this problem, but it seems to be effective! 

I'm not 100% happy with the connection points on the hardware, they're certainly not sturdy enough for daily use, but I'm hopeful that everything will work well for the occasional wear that I think is likely for this. As always, there are approximately twelve million things I wish I'd done differently, but that's how we learn and all that, right? 

Thank you for reading my brief novella about that one time that I made a belt! Would love to hear your thoughts, awkwardly sidestep your praise, and see what y'all are working on :)

***""Record-breaking revenue, new market entries, and transformative partnerships highlight our path to increasing shareholder value and long-term growth.""***

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ / ACCESSWIRE / October 8, 2024 /** Dear Shareholders,

2024 has been a banner year for CBD Life Sciences, Inc. (CBDL), and we are thrilled to provide you with an exciting corporate update that underscores the massive growth and strategic advancements that are rapidly transforming our business. As of February 2024, we have achieved an extraordinary *1,405.46% increase in revenue*, our highest to date, cementing CBDL as a dominant player in the booming CBD and wellness sectors.

This remarkable growth was driven by our aggressive expansion into new retail markets. By entering Amazon and Walmart Marketplace, two of the largest retail platforms globally, we have unlocked access to over *$950 billion* in combined annual consumer spending. This strategic move has resulted in a *300% growth in online sales* since launch, and we're just getting started.

Our product line continues to drive exceptional demand. The launch of our *Mellow Mornings* nano CBD coffee creamers, along with our fast-acting pain relief cream, has resonated deeply with consumers looking for innovative, effective solutions. In fact, early sales data shows a *500% increase in unit sales* for our nano CBD products alone, and our partnerships with local coffee shops have expanded our reach exponentially, with CBD-infused beverages seeing *an average 40% increase in customer orders*.

Our entrance into the cannabis market, through partnerships with key dispensaries, is expected to fuel additional revenue growth in 2025, with the cannabis industry projected to reach *$73.6 billion* by 2027. Our pipeline is filled with potential, and we anticipate these moves will unlock multi-million-dollar opportunities for CBDL in the coming quarters.

We are not just scaling, but we are scaling smartly, with a *40% increase in gross margins* year-over-year, thanks to our focus on high-margin products and streamlined operations. Furthermore, we are on track to deliver continued triple-digit growth, with projected revenues for 2024 set to surpass *$10 million*, driven by product innovation and continued retail expansion.

For shareholders, this means an extraordinary opportunity to capitalize on one of the fastest-growing companies in the CBD space. The company has no intentions of doing reverse split. Our relentless focus on innovation, strategic market entry, and partnerships with leading retailers positions us to not only meet but exceed your expectations in the near future.

Thank you for your continued confidence and trust as we chart a course to even greater heights.

Sincerely,

1-Wanting to be a parent is inherently selfish. You want to carry a baby, you want to see your DNA in another person etc..is all for you, not for the child (also let me point out, the fact that your doctor said it’s a bad idea to have another baby due to your post birth complications yet you’re risking Matilda’s mother for another baby is extremely selfish) 

2-you take M to Disney constantly because you said that’s the childhood you wanted. But recently you said she is shy. Do you think maybe she doesn’t completely like Disney? Maybe she would prefer calmer situations? But because that’s where you wanted to be that’s where you drag her day after day.

3-your child has not had consistent sleep in her life because you don’t want to put the effort to establish a schedule. And I get not wanting to be in the house all day, but even just taking time to step away while you’re out, get her some quiet to have a consistent nap instead of always expecting her to just fall asleep wherever can make a world of difference. You force her into your life instead of acknowledging she’s a new person with different needs.

4-that child does not have a baby friendly social life. She doesn’t go places that might stimulate her mind as a baby. She doesn’t go to story times, children’s museums, parks. She goes shopping, she goes to coffee shops etc. Those places are for you, not for her.

I just wanna ask advise   
So I (27M) had a happy crush on (26M) and is now spiraling down to this feeling of wanting more than a happy crush.  
  
I met him through an IG story from a close friend of mine and he had me introduce myself to him which I did and ever since then we've been exchanging and interacting with each other till this day.  
  
He is not perfect and still has a lot of baggage that I will not disclose but I can say is I sympathize with him, since I went through the same hell just on different roads but I mean in this day and age who hasn't experience that before ? plus I can see the effort he is putting in making himself better again which I love.  
  
We have a lot of common denominators and he is really a joy to talk and be with, I feel light whenever I talk to him and can always feel at ease. I just don't know if he also feels the same... So in a few weeks we are planning to meet each other for the first time and I'm planning to make my move .. it may sound outdated but I plan on giving him a flower like the one in beauty and the beast and a love letter and since we both play genshin impact I also plan on giving him visions as well, its my late bday gifts to him and my attempt on confessing my feelings for him but I am hesitant and losing conviction to do so ... Because yesterday he went on a random coffee date with someone although we did talk of how it went he said he wasn't sure because of the age gap so it kind of gave me hope that I still may have a chance but it seems he is willing to try nonetheless ? Not 100% sure on what he's planning or thinking but the uncertainty of things is making me doubt ... I still wanna give it a shot and see where it goes cuz we have already established a bond but I'm also scared of the thought of being rejected and losing him.  
  
I've been inhaling copium since then and been telling myself if it didn't work at least I tried, at least I manage to put my feelings out there again but deep down I'm hoping and wishing that it was me ... praying that it could be me.  
  
Should I still confess and give it a shot despite the odds or should I just stay quiet and support him and admire him from a far ?",0,1728389718.0,phlgbt,6,0.43,False

I see yet another urologist next week for a second opinion. I've had a cystoscopy done to look for the source of the blood in my urine but nothing could be found. I was told just to drink water and take OAB meds.

Well, things were fine for a while, minus the blood in the urine, no real symptoms until last year. They just exploded out of nowhere: urgency, constantly feeling the need to go, squeezing/pressure, leakage (I wear period panties or pantyliners/pads daily), never feeling empty, etc. No real sharp/burning pain, thankfully. Saw my GP who gave me Myrbetriq 25mg which helped some but I didn't find real relief until 50mg.

Except lately, it seems like it's worse when I take it? For the past several days, I have been seeing a huge uptick in symptoms. Or maybe it's wearing off and is no longer effective? But strangely enough, when I don't take the Myrbetriq on the weekends, it seems better. Idk if that's because I'm not drinking as much or not moving around as much, idk. I can usually wear normal panties on the weekend with minimal issue. But I feel like I probably drink about the same amount as I do at work, maybe even more.

What is going on here? Of course I'll bring this up to my new doctor but just wondered if anyone had a similar experience. I will admit, I'm not doing the proper IC diet because I already have several other chronic illnesses that leave me feeling exhausted and fatigued and I'm already doing what I can for them. So, caffeine is a must at work. But I drink one travel mug of coffee in the morning, water, and then usually a can of soda at lunch, followed by more water.

Also, is 50mg the max dose of Myrbetriq?",1,1728389716.0,Interstitialcystitis,0,1.0,False

# What are smoothies?

Smoothies are thick, creamy beverages usually blended from puréed fruits, vegetables, juices, yogurt, nuts, seeds, and/or dairy or nondairy milk.

Many smoothies include frozen produce or ice cubes to give the final product the cool, icy consistency of a milkshake. However, their flavor profiles vary tremendously depending on the ingredients. Why is the Smoothie Diet so effective?

The most basic smoothie starts with two essential ingredients — a base and a liquid. From there, you can combine ingredients to your liking.

Weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise. This Smoothie Diet cuts out all the awful foods that are making you gain weight while boosting your metabolism, cutting your cravings, and reducing your caloric intake (without ever leaving you hungry). Plus, the Smoothie Diet is insanely convenient. Convenience is the single biggest factor that leads to diet success or failure. If something is hard, you’re unlikely to stick with it. If it’s a breeze, then why wouldn’t you follow through?

# Do smoothies aid weight loss?

Smoothies are frequently marketed as a weight loss tool. Research suggests they may be effective for this purpose as long as they’re not causing you to exceed your daily calorie needs. While some people find smoothies an easy way to monitor food portions and stay on top of their  
weight loss goals, others may not feel as full when they drink their calories rather than eating them.

It was MADE for busy people.

If you’re busy, then you’re about to fall in love with a diet (yes, you read that correctly). As long as you can set aside about ***20 minutes to make the smoothies*** in the morning, you’ll have all the time you need to make this diet work for you.

# You don’t have to give up food.

This isn’t JUST a smoothie diet. You drink 2 smoothies every day, but you still eat a whole healthy meal and snacks every day (samples are provided in the Smoothie Diet guide). If you need or want a break, you can add in a flex day every week and just eat regular foods (following the included Smoothie Diet guide). This flexibility makes it easy to manage, even if your schedule is unpredictable.

# It’s easier than pie (and also kind of tastes like pie?)

All the recipes are super easy to follow and made with ingredients you can find in any grocery store. (And yes, they’re decadent and delicious!)

# And most importantly, you can lose as much weight

# as you want!

I can’t tell you exactly how much weight you’ll lose on **the Smoothie Diet**, because it will depend on a lot of factors, but one of Drew’s clients (Amanda) used the Smoothie Diet after the birth of her second son and lost 70 lbs (she started with the 21-day plan and then kept going for a few months by following Drew’s tips). Another client, Dawn, lost 14 lbs in 21 days. So, while there is no specific number, you can be sure you’ll lose weight and love the process.

Part 1 of the analysis: https://www.reddit.com/r/Wednesday/s/VjmZBnsloC

How many parts total? Atleast 3 however part 3 is not written yet.


Wednesday starting to giving a fuck about those around her is another driving part of how we see Wednesday change over the course of the first season. Her relationships with Thing, Enid, and Tyler are where we see her main evolution. Eugene also to a certain extent, but him being attacked influences her the most.

When we first meet Wednesday, she is very distrusting, cold, and independent. She distrusts her parents, Weems, Dr Kinbott, and the sheriff. She plans to escape and never see her parents again. We got some development on this from parents’ weekend. It seems more that her distrust is more focused on her mother. When her father apologizes for ‘not being a good father she gives him many examples of how he did an adequate job and how he helped make her independent and true to herself. I am excited to get more information about her relationship with her mother in the next season. There seems to be some resentment there. She doesn’t want to live in her shadow. She doesn’t seem to value motherhood and has a hard time with positive emotions. She doesn’t understand love and aspires to do more with her life than be a house wife. We don’t get much regarding this, but I wouldn’t be surprised if she thinks her mother wasted her talents becoming a mother and housewife. 
Thing she forces to pledge his undying loyalty when she discovers him at Nevermore. She trusts him as an ally though is very hard on him in failure. I would be interested to know what her relationship with Thing was prior to this. She does truly care for him. She is very brazen with him. However, she cries and does not give up when he is stabbed. She also declares revenge must be sought. Thing also influences her relationship with her other main relationships.

I think one reason why the friendship anamoly between End and Wednesday works because of Thing. Enid wanted a bestie and someone to bond with so she wormed her way into Wednesday’s life. There may be some sort of preconceived notion about dorm roommates. Thornhill made a comment about making connections you normally wouldn’t is part of the dorm experience. And that they can turn into life long bonds. Thing serves as the person who can do the things with Enid that Wednesday cannot stand: shopping, manicures, etc. Enid also seems much less secure in who she is (atleast in the start of the series). Wednesday helps her gain confidence. Enid in turn shows Wednesday loyalty and acceptance. When Wednesday wanted to go to the Gates mansion when the school was on lockdown, she tricks Enid into helping her get out of the school. At this point, she is more obsessed with the Gates mansion mystery and being out maneuvered by the killer and care for the safety of her friends isn’t as present. But she is sad that she drives Enid away. They way that they act during their fight shows they care, but are being petty. A last note on Wednesday and Enid: Wednesday telling her about Nero and why she doesn’t cry seems out of place. But it does show that even in the beginning she has some trust or connection with Enid even then. Enid showed a vulnerability to Wednesday so Wednesday returned with one in kind. I think this is a great example of Wednesday having emotions and showing that she puts on a front to a certain extent. That she does have some deep cares and has feelings. She isn’t as 2D as she seems to want people to think and she is using defense mechanisms as guessed by Kinbott (But that also isn’t 100% of what is going on either). 

The other character that seems to get Wednesday to bring down some of her walls is Tyler. Whether you like the love interest storyline or not with him, she was still compelled to be around him and allowed more than a “business” relationship.
When she first meets Tyler, he is combative with her. He is stressed trying to figure out the espresso machine, she essentially questions his competence (assuming he doens’t know what a quad is) and he returns with more banter. He softens as she questions him and adds details about herself. I think Wednesday likes seeing people’s reactions to her odd hobbies and interests (the comment to Thornhill about secretly enjoying that other people think she is weird). He gives a ‘okay cool’ reaction and then moves on. She offers up her name when he asks: which could have been a product of banter and him being a smart ass so she does what he doesn’t expect and gives it. He offers to help which she accepts (she is getting a coffee and a ride out of her fixing the coffee machine. The look on her face seems to show some respect for him as he cannot be bought. In the first episode Tyler just seems to take in who she is and is curious about her. Through out many episodes we see comrodery between the two of them: wanting to leave Jericho, being in court ordered therapy, his dad being difficult, sharing why they are in court ordered therapy. He also seeks her out which is what is required to be in Wednesday’s life: people need to worm their way in. He seeks out Gomez’s police file and gives it to her and she responds that she is not used to people engaging with her. Kind of showing vulnerability and that there is more to her than the front that she puts up of not caring. There are many instances with Tyler where she normally would have not continued the conversation or shown vulnerability with others that she does. 
	• When Eugene suggested they go to the dance together, she was horrified and said no instantly
	• When Xavier figured out why she asked him to the dance, all he gets is a ‘it’s nothing personal’
	• When Wednesday and Xavier are talking about his proximity to the monster she tells him “for some reason I cannot fathom or indulge you seem to like me”
	• When Kinbott tries to talk to her about the Rave’N she asks if she is required to answer her questions outside of their sessions.
With Tyler, she banters with him (episode 3): eating Girl Scouts for breakfast (and throwing in for good measure the comment about an uncle to see his reaction. Episode 4, she warns him about his dad and offers up information about the dance that led to more conversation and confrontation. Her excuse to him on not knowing her feelings towards him was priority not, nah we are just friends. Which I feel like with other people she would have been blunt about. This is where her not liking positive emotions comes in to play and feeling that others will disappoint you and hating vulnerability comes into play. There was something going on there but she didn’t want to address it because she was uncomfortable with the new emotions she was feeling. I think she could have recognized what that feeling was (as she mention having a first crush in a writer/philosopher). But she doesn’t like those emotions (like the conversation with her father on how he is a good father) so she deflects and tries to move away from those. You could maybe argue that she wanted to keep Tyler as a resource however, she would likely just move on and try to find another way to obtain information. She is resourceful and does view people as expendable to a certain extent. She does says she prefers self reliance and being an island. Other examples of why I think she cares for Tyler:
	• When he shows up for the dance, she doesn’t tell him everything was Thing’s doing. She instantly forgot about Eugene and focused on him
	• She was looking at him almost the entire time of her dancing to Goo Goo Muc and allowed him in her orbit. Depending on what she was doing she allowed him to be closer to her and when he got confused where she went she tapped his shoulder to get his attention
	• She started ghosting him after Eugene got hurt: she didn’t want to hurt him
	• Tricking him in to taking her to the Gates mansion is where her obsession overrode her care in that moment. However, she did go back for him, she patched him up, and she tried to stay away and not get Tyler in trouble.
	• She seems thrown off when Xavier tells her about Tyler assaulting him. I think this is where her moral compass comes in. If she thought Tyler was motivated by hate for outcasts, they would have had a very different conversation. She also doesn’t refute him comment about “I knew there was a reason I liked you”
	• Wednesday doesn’t want to “owe’ anyone anything and generally doesn’t feel she owes anyone anything. She hated that Xavier saved her from the Gargoyle. She didn’t want him to save her so she didn’t owe him anything, With Tyler and the date, he was able to tell her she owed him and she took it (small protest but definitely not with the same out of vigor you would expect from her)
	• She warned him how she could hurt him if they became more than friends (which is ironic when he is found to be the hyde). But if she hadn’t wanted to kiss him, she would have stayed stiff.. But when he moved in to kiss her in the crypt, she moved in in return. She also described their date as ‘interrupted’  implying that she had wanted to kiss him as there was something missing
	• She enjoyed the date in the crypt. (Her facial expressions, “that was torture, thank you”
	• She was so betrayed when she found out he was the Hyde. The fact that she was tricked and ‘lost’ is part of it. But she put trust in him and was vulnerable with him that she is very guarded against. She is rash and lets her negative emotions take over (kidnapping and torture). Was that only part of it, likely yes. She didn’t trust Weems or the sheriff, thought Kinbott was Laurel. And when she tried to talk to Weems about Kinbott, Kinbott was in her office so that likely caused come hesitancy on whether she could trust Weems with her theory. She was motivated by revenge. Honestly, I think her reaction to him being the Hyde would have been very different had she found out prior to Eugene getting attacked.
	• She smiled when she kissed him and was active in the kiss (he pushed into her and she pushed back)


A note on friendships and love interests for Wednesday:

I am guessing that the writers did intend for Wednesday to fall for Tyler. That was how him being the Hyde was actually impactful to her. Otherwise, it would have just been the feeling of I’m wrong.

Growth from being an island is one of the major character developments we see from Wednesday so while some don’t like that she had love interests I thought it was fine. I don’t really see how it is different someone pursing a friendship with her vs a romantic relationship with her.  I think that from an outside view, close friendships and romantic relationships can look similar. It is all about how the people in those relationships define them and feel. Which we all know Wednesday is bad with non-negative emotions. As I said before: people have to worm their way into Wednesday’s life. She is going to resist, however Enid, Tyler and thing were insistent on being in her life. If they hadn’t, she would have stayed an island. I feel like Enid’s character needs more development time in season 2 which is likely because she is Wednesday’s bestie and her wolfing out and fighting the Hyde really solidified her and Wednesday’s bond.. While Tyler is seemingly the enemy at this point, I hope they spend more time on his connections into the overall world. Because he has so many tie ins (especially with the potential for world building), I hope he stays an important character, but since this is Wednesday, he will need to stay relevant to Wednesday (whether that is redemption to love interest, friend, or somehow frenemy)

When it comes to romantic and/or platonic feelings, logic really doesn’t work. Wednesday is very rooted in logic. So navigating any sort of relationship is uncharted territory for her. I think this is why her having a love interest is criticized because you aren’t going to see the normal teen reactions to things (think Enid vs the subtle changes you see in Wednesday’s face.) The subtlety of Wednesday leave open different interpretations and storylines for the writers to take so they can naturally grow the character as we move along in the story. 
 
I am not even going to try to make a guess on Wednesday’s sexuality. That is for the writers and the character to show us if they even want to put a definition to it. Based upon how they have developed her character so far, the road is open to what happens naturally in the story and can change based upon different experiences. I firmly believe Wednesday did fall for Tyler: but where she develops going forward is tbd. 

And by no means does her caring for SOME people make her soft. She believed that being close with anyone is a weakness and has semi had that come true. So we will see where she is after some time away from Nevermore. My assessment of her alignment is that she is chaotic neutral. The chaotic part I feel is an easy assessment: she definitely does not follow the law and is not above murder (Attempted murder charges would just make her seem incompetent)

# What are smoothies?

Smoothies are thick, creamy beverages usually blended from puréed fruits, vegetables, juices, yogurt, nuts, seeds, and/or dairy or nondairy milk.

Many smoothies include frozen produce or ice cubes to give the final product the cool, icy consistency of a milkshake. However, their flavor profiles vary tremendously depending on the ingredients. Why is the Smoothie Diet so effective?

The most basic smoothie starts with two essential ingredients — a base and a liquid. From there, you can combine ingredients to your liking.

Weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise. This Smoothie Diet cuts out all the awful foods that are making you gain weight while boosting your metabolism, cutting your cravings, and reducing your caloric intake (without ever leaving you hungry). Plus, the Smoothie Diet is insanely convenient. Convenience is the single biggest factor that leads to diet success or failure. If something is hard, you’re unlikely to stick with it. If it’s a breeze, then why wouldn’t you follow through?

The best thing about the [***Smoothie Diet***](https://tinyurl.com/5b6av9a4) is that it helps you KEEP LOSING WEIGHT even after the 21 days are over. Many of Drew’s clients choose to swap out one meal per day with a smoothie for a few more weeks or months.

# Can we Lose Weight with Smoothies Diet plans?

Smoothies are an increasingly popular wellness trend and are frequently marketed as a health food.

These versatile beverages are portable, family-friendly, and modifiable for any taste or dietary preference. ***Smoothies*** are easy to prepare yourself, but you can also purchase fresh or bottled ones from specialty cafés and most major grocery stores.

While some types are loaded with veggies and fruit, others pack sugar or other unhealthy ingredients. As such, you may wonder whether they’re a healthy choice.

# Do smoothies aid weight loss?

Smoothies are frequently marketed as a weight loss tool. Research suggests they may be effective for this purpose as long as they’re not causing you to exceed your daily calorie needs. While some people find smoothies an easy way to monitor food portions and stay on top of their  
weight loss goals, others may not feel as full when they drink their calories rather than eating them.

It was MADE for busy people.

If you’re busy, then you’re about to fall in love with a diet (yes, you read that correctly). As long as you can set aside about ***20 minutes to make the smoothies*** in the morning, you’ll have all the time you need to make this diet work for you.

# You don’t have to give up food.

This isn’t JUST a smoothie diet. You drink 2 smoothies every day, but you still eat a whole healthy meal and snacks every day (samples are provided in the Smoothie Diet guide). If you need or want a break, you can add in a flex day every week and just eat regular foods (following the included Smoothie Diet guide). This flexibility makes it easy to manage, even if your schedule is unpredictable.

# It’s easier than pie (and also kind of tastes like pie?)

All the recipes are super easy to follow and made with ingredients you can find in any grocery store. (And yes, they’re decadent and delicious!)

# And most importantly, you can lose as much weight

# as you want!
