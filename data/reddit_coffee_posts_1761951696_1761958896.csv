She's a wonderful help and her notes are good. I daresay she cares waaaay more than I do about learning techniques and trying things with kids to help them which is awesome (I might be the same if I had more time). 

What is a typical SLP-SLPA working relationship like? I don't have time or interest in idle chitchat but I feel like I'm being cold if I don't try to be friendly. But my smiles are strained and I can't think of many nice, shallow things to say when my mind is racing just to keep up with my daily tasks. 

I've gotten her a coffee/drink here and there to show my appreciation but I just feel so awkward. Part of the reason I became an SLP was to have more autonomy because I've always sucked at work relationships. Would not be surprised at all if I'm a bit on the autism spectrum myself. 

Tell me... what's your SLP-SLPA relationship look like?",1,1761958704.0,slp,0,1.0,False

Hi! It's nice to meet you. I am a 29 year old cisgender asexual/omniromantic female who is looking to meet anyone who considers themselves to be male. My hobbies include watching cooking , baking, knitting, sewing, reading, anime, reading manga, reading comic books, reading manhwa, watching cartoons, reading webtoons etc. Those are not all my hobbies you'll have to message me to find out more. I would like to get married eventually. I would not like to have kids. I consider myself to be sex repulsed and would prefer a partner who is the same. I am looking for someone kind, caring, accepting, honest, loyal, respectful, someone who makes me feel safe. I want someone accepting because I have some disabilities. They are autism, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and schizoaffective disorder. I also have a genetic defect that makes me extremely sensitive to certain things such as caffeine, so no coffee dates. Being accepting of me and my disabilities is a requirement. As for my appearance I am 5'6, 166 pounds (so slightly overweight), dark brown curly hair that is somewhat long, dark brown eyes, and olive skin tone. I am not religious and would prefer someone who is also that way. Also appearance is way too important for me. I am not a fan of physical touch and would prefer someone who is the same.  I am from New York and would prefer someone from the USA. However I am also open to long distance. Anyway I look forward to hearing from you soon! Also you must like mushrooms, beets, and molasses. Also please make an effort when messaging me. By effort I I mean at least 1 sentence, not 1 word. Physical attraction is much more important to me than personality. Also I am currently living in a group home for now due to being disabled. If you can’t handle those things don’t message me. Also please don’t expect me to work from home. I much prefer working at a workplace rather than staying at home all day.

I’m a 30-year-old curvy Mexican Latina who’s lived in DTLA long enough to know that everyone’s “looking for something real”… until it’s time to communicate, make plans, or show effort. 🙃

So here I am, writing this, hoping maybe one genuine, emotionally intelligent human will read it and think, “Wait — she gets it.”

I’m not looking for something rushed or surface-level. I’ve done my healing, built my peace, and learned that love isn’t about chaos — it’s about comfort, communication, and someone who actually shows up.

I’m the type who’ll listen when you talk, remember the little things, and make you laugh in between deep conversations about life and whatever random thing just popped into our heads. But I also value peace — so if you’re still tangled up in an ex, figuring out your feelings, or in a complicated situation with a kid’s mom… I’m not the person to step into that. I want something calm, consistent, and built on mutual respect.

Here’s a little snapshot of my vibe: 
☕️I’m happiest sipping an latte at a local coffee shop, people-watching or chatting about everything and nothing. 
🍓Farmers markets, cozy bookstores, small art galleries — yes, I’ll linger too long and touch every candle. 
🎤I love live music, street tacos, beach sunsets, and the kind of laughter that makes your cheeks hurt. 
🐾And if a dog/cat walks by? Sorry, I’ll be talking to them before I remember to finish my sentence. 🐶🐱

I don’t drive right now, so I stick close to DTLA — but honestly, there’s so much to do nearby if you’re creative and a little spontaneous: picnics at Vista Hermosa, rooftop coffee dates, comedy nights, late-night donut runs… if you can hold a good conversation, the rest is easy.

I’m looking for someone in their 30s or 40s who’s emotionally grounded, affectionate, and knows what they want. Someone who’s done the growing and healing — not perfect, just self-aware. The kind of man who texts back, listens with intention, and makes you feel safe just by being himself.

If that sounds like you, send a few photos and tell me a bit about yourself — not the résumé version, but the real one. What makes you laugh? What do you love doing when no one’s watching? What’s your favorite random LA spot?

💬 My first message will be this post, just to make sure we’re aligned before jumping into conversation — because let’s be honest, emotional compatibility > fake chemistry every time.

If you’re someone who still believes in showing up, laughing often, loving softly, and talking like you mean it — I think we’ll get along just fine. 💞",0,1761958559.0,AskLosAngeles,5,0.14,False

On the downside, it cannot run a coffee maker, which was a bit disappointing since it only turns on for about two seconds before shutting off. However, it was able to run a mini fridge all night and a TV for 7 hours, which was somewhat surprising.

On the positive side, it can run a projector, iPad, and speaker simultaneously for four nights without recharging, and we were also able to charge phones and laptops daily. The solar panels worked well too; even on a cloudy day, we could recharge the battery to 42%, and it likely would have fully charged in full sun. I contacted customer service about the coffee maker issue, and their response was good—they quickly helped me exchange the unit.

Overall, if your needs are small devices or charging phones and tablets, it works fine, but don’t expect it to run a coffee maker or other high-power appliances. Quick and helpful customer service is definitely a plus.",0,1761958552.0,camping,0,0.5,False

I’ve been buried in stress lately. Bills are stacking up, the mortgage is already past due, and the utilities are threatening shut-off. Then the factory I work at closed down and I lost my job. That was the gut-punch. I’ve been walking around with this knot in my stomach for weeks, barely sleeping. But tonight isn’t about that.

Tonight is Halloween.

Andrea’s been buzzing around the porch all afternoon, hanging fake cobwebs and setting out bowls of candy. Kain’s costume is already laid out by the door… he’s been so wound up he can hardly sit still. For the first time in months I actually feel excited.

We’re in a new house, in a new neighborhood, a small rural village… maybe fifteen hundred people total. Quiet, tucked away from the world, the kind of place where the streetlights hum and the yards all smell like freshly fallen leaves.

When we stepped outside, Kain raced off the porch like a stock car, plastic pumpkin swinging at his side. Andrea laughed, pulling her coat tight. They both seemed so caught up in the magic of the night that the knot in the pit of my stomach went away, and for a moment it all felt normal and stress-free.

The sun had started to set… not quite dark yet, but dim. The air was crisp, filled with the scent of fresh leaves and the sound of children laughing and screaming. We set off on our candy-filled journey. Everywhere we looked: witches, goblins, and ghosts, candy bags in hand, eagerly rushing door to door.

We made our way around the village square and surrounding blocks. Finally, with Kain’s plastic pumpkin almost full, we decided to turn onto the far end of our street. As we moved along, only a few porch lights remained, and the sound of children faded away. What was left was the shuffling of Kain’s feet in the dry leaves and the eerie cries of the wind.

We pushed on for another block, and that’s when I saw it. I stopped Kain before we walked up to it. Andrea tapped me on the shoulder.

“Do you see that house? Looks like something out of a scary movie.”

I nodded. She wasn’t wrong. It was a modest two-story colonial, the sort you could picture your grandparents struggling to maintain in the historic part of town. Big screened-in porch, brick siding with vines and foliage climbing up to the roof. No car in the driveway. The front door hung half open, moving with the wind… inviting, but wrong.

As we stood there, the air grew still. I noticed the front room didn’t have blinds, and the light inside was on. It was a decaying room on full display… crumbling sheetrock walls giving way to exposed slats. The most unsettling part was the lone wooden dining chair, staged in the center of the room directly under a solitary hanging bulb. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t.

“Let’s get out of here before Leatherface storms out,” Andrea whispered in my ear.

I agreed, and we set back off down the road toward home, the sound of candy rattling in Kain’s bucket as he grinned.

That night we sat watching scary movies together, snuggled up on the couch, sorting through and snacking on this year’s candy cache. I couldn’t shake that house from my mind, though. Every time I closed my eyes, all I saw was that chair, positioned as if waiting for an unlucky guest.

“Is everything okay? You seem distant.”

“I’m fine. I just can’t get that damn house out of my head. That chair… and what the hell, the front door just flapping open like that?”

“It was weird, but we’re home now,” Andrea said.

I looked over at Kain; he was happy as a pig in mud, snacking on a full-size chocolate bar.

I suppose I should have been happy. Andrea had the night off work and Kain was still caught up in the magic of Halloween.

“Want a piece of candy, Dad?”

“Sure, bud. But after this piece let’s put it up for the night, yeah?”

“But… but why?”

“Because you don’t need to be up late bouncing off the walls.”

“Besides, your face is starting to look like you ate a tub of candy,” his mother told him, smiling that proud, motherly smile from ear to ear.

“Yeah, what your mother said,” I quipped.

The evening was coming to a close. The sound of crickets struggled to cut through the eerie autumn breeze that carried the smell of burning leaves and pumpkin with it.

I looked down at my watch… 10 p.m. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Kain passed out, drooling, curled into Andrea’s arms. She was sleeping too.

“Let’s go to bed. It’s been a long day,” I said as I prodded her awake.

She responded with incoherent mumbles as she stood up. I picked up Kain, careful not to wake him, and hauled all forty pounds of his tiny frame up the stairs to his room, tripping over his collection of toy guns and almost falling face-first into his dresser. I laid him down and tucked him under his dinosaur blanket.

I stood there for a moment, watching him gracefully snooze, wondering to myself… how did I possibly get this lucky? How does a screw-up like me end up with such a beautiful family?

That’s when it hit me—immense guilt rushed over me like a typhoon.

I’m letting them down. I’m half the man I’m supposed to be. You’re not providing anything. You’re going to lose it all if you don’t figure something out. They’d be better off without you.

The kind of thoughts your brain screams when you’re a father to an amazing child and husband to a beautiful woman, but you’re failing financially.

Wandering to my room through the dark hallway, I felt so defeated. Taking off my clothes and climbing into bed next to Andrea, who was already asleep, was a welcome relief. I closed my eyes. There it was, clear as day—the chair.

I woke up feeling like I hadn’t slept at all. My head was heavy, my chest tight, and I was drenched in sweat. Sunlight leaked through the blinds… warm and ordinary, a nice change of pace from the dream I’d had.

Kain’s cartoons were already blasting from downstairs, Andrea moving around in the kitchen. The smell of coffee and bacon cut through the house. It should have been comforting. Instead, I felt like I was dragging chains just getting out of bed.

When I shuffled into the kitchen, Andrea looked up from the pan, raising an eyebrow.

“Jesus, you look like hell,” she said. “Rough night?”

“Yeah… just a dream,” I muttered, reaching for the coffee. My hands still shook. How could I tell her about finding Kain cold and blue in his bed? About the sound the fireplace poker made when it struck her? I didn’t want to tell her about the sickening way her left eye bulged from its socket, as if the bone gave way and tried to spit it out of her face. And I sure as hell didn’t tell her how it ended—with me covered in blood, sitting down in that chair, shard of glass in hand, slicing my own throat.

“Well, that’s behind you now. Get some breakfast, you’ll feel better,” she insisted.

“Thank you. Not just for breakfast… for everything you do. I love you.”

“Must have been some dream. I love you too.”

I drained the rest of my dark roast, hoping the bitterness would clear the fog in my head. Failed attempt. Andrea was humming at the stove, Kain glued securely to the TV. For a second I thought I could let it go… pretend the night never happened, convince myself the dream wasn’t still crawling under my skin.

“I’m gonna go check the mail,” I told her, and made my way to the door.

When I stepped outside, the air was sharp, colder than yesterday, and the smell of burning leaves clung to the air like a dense seasonal fog. Dead leaves crunched under the soles of my bare feet as I made my way down the driveway. I reached the mailbox and reached in—empty.

“Better than another delinquent notice,” I muttered to myself.

“What’s that?” I heard a familiar voice say.

I looked up—it was Steve, my neighbor, standing in his yard, a cigarette hanging from his lips.

“Nothing, just mumbling to myself,” I replied as I shuffled through the leaves in his direction.

“How was your first Halloween in the village?” he asked, taking a drag.

“Wasn’t too shabby. Kain had a blast.”

“Good!”  
“You lived here your whole life?”

“Born and bred.”

“You know anything about the big old house a few blocks up the road? Whoever lives there sure cranked up the creep factor last night.”

“The one three blocks up with the overgrown siding?” He had a curious look.

“That’s the one. It was unnerving… door swinging open like it was daring me to enter. There was a dining chair placed under a hanging bulb, looking right out into the yard.”

He looked at me like I had antlers growing out of my head before saying, “That place has been vacant since I was a kid.”

“Are you sure?” I asked.

He had the most bewildered look on his face, eyes wide with curiosity. “Yeah, I’m sure. My best friend lived there.”

“Well, shit. It seemed like someone was home last night,” I thought to myself. “Why’s it been empty so long?”

I could see the discomfort in Steve’s eyes. Through clenched teeth he explained, “About twenty-five years ago my friend and his family lived there. Then my friend died.”

“Cancer?” I asked.

“I wish. His dad snapped and killed him and his mom… then killed himself right there in the front room. It’s been empty ever since.”

“Jesus… what happened?”

“Well, my friend’s dad had lost his job and was under a lot of stress, and he just snapped. Nobody saw it coming. Up until that night he was a solid guy… a real pillar of the community. Took the whole village by surprise.”

“Fuck… I’m sorry, man.”

“It’s okay. It was a long time ago.”

Even though he said it was fine, pain clearly washed over his face as he told the story. We exchanged small talk and pleasantries for a few moments, but the mood had definitely soured. Just then I caught Andrea looking out the window, and I took it as my chance to weasel out of the awkward conversation.

“Well, looks like the wife needs me,” I said nervously.

“No problem, man. Good talk.” He chuckled. “Hey, Mike.”

I turned around. “Yeah?”

Steve looked rattled, almost nervous. “Just… let the house lie.”

I shuffled my way back through the leaves toward the house. I tried to put it out of my mind, but it ate at me all day.

Later that night I lay down and tried to get some sleep. I figured it might help get the house out of my head. I put on a movie and slowly started to drift away.

That familiar, terrifying feeling of free-falling hit me… falling to sleep, literally. When I landed on the other side of consciousness, I was in that chair. I looked down and there was a notebook in my lap and a pistol resting on top of it.

I grabbed the gun and opened the notebook. The smell of pennies was so thick in the air I could not only taste it but feel it, like a thin layer of filth coating my tongue. When I flipped through the notebook, it had one sentence frantically scribbled over and over again:

“Together, Forever.”

I wanted to stand up and run out of the house, but my legs wouldn’t move. Then, without any effort or control on my part, my arm raised the gun to my mouth. I couldn’t stop it. I was powerless—merely a spectator to whatever spectacle I’d been given a front-row seat to. Then, as suddenly as I’d fallen asleep, the barrel was in my mouth. I clenched down on it so hard I felt and heard my teeth breaking. The taste of cold steel, gun oil, and blood was overwhelming.

Bang.

Suddenly I woke up in bed beside Andrea, the smell of gunsmoke heavy in my nose.

 

 

I stared vacantly, light bleeding through the blinds, illuminating the room.

“What the fuck is happening to me?”

In that moment, I decided the only way to get to the bottom of it was to get inside that damn house. It was like a cancer growing inside me, festering quietly, and I needed to cut it out.

Andrea could tell something was wrong, but she didn’t ask.

“Good morning, butthead. I love you.”

I told her that while getting lost in those beautiful brown eyes. I could honestly stare into them for hours.

“I love you too,” she said, smiling that gorgeous smile.

I got up and walked downstairs, took a piss, and hit the kitchen.

Kain was there… dining chair dragged up to the counter… raiding the cabinet for his candy stash.

“No cereal this morning, bud?”

He must not have realized I was there, because he jumped hard enough to nearly fall.

“Geez, Dad, you jump-scared me. I was just looking for my candy.”

“Do you really need all that sugar? You’re jumpy enough as it is.”

Andrea snuck up behind me, wrapped her arms around my neck, and leaned in close. Her voice came out soft against my ear.

“Let him. It only comes once a year.”

She kissed the back of my neck and went to the fridge.

She was right. How could I tell him no?

“Okay—but if he starts acting like a spazz, you’re dealing with it.”

We went about the day like usual, though my head was somewhere else. Today I was plotting my next move… getting into that damn house.

Later that night, around eight, I tucked Kain into bed and put on his favorite movie—*Jurassic World.* I told Andrea I needed to grab a few things from the store, but that was a lie. I had a more pressing matter to deal with.

I grabbed the truck keys and stepped outside.

It was cold… not the kind of cool you expect in fall, but a sharp, bitter chill that sank straight to the bone.

The street was dead silent. The sound of leaves crunching beneath my boots was deafening in the still air. The wind picked up as I reached for the truck door, letting out hollow whooshes and low whistles, almost like the air itself was warning me. Whispering things I didn’t want to hear.

I ignored them.

The engine turned over and roared to life, echoing down the empty street. I drove toward the house that had been rotting in my mind like an infected wound.

I parked a few houses down and killed the lights.

As soon as I stepped out, it hit me—anxiety, dread, melancholy—all washing over me like a storm I couldn’t brace against.

I walked toward the house, scanning for a way in. An upstairs light was on, faint and flickering.

The screen door hung ajar, creaking in the breeze. The whole place seemed to breathe around me. Every board, every nail… it all watched.

The hair on the back of my neck stood up. My arms went cold.

That’s when it happened.

A desperate, ear-shattering scream tore through the quiet from somewhere inside.

I froze.

Then, slowly, the front door creaked open, like it was inviting me in.

I didn’t think—I just ran.

The moment I crossed the threshold, everything changed. The air turned still. Heavy. Wrong. The screaming stopped. The silence that followed wasn’t peaceful… it was alive.

The scream died the moment I crossed the threshold.  
Air thickened. Damp. Metallic.

The bulb above the chair flicked to life with a buzz, spilling jaundiced light across the floor.

The chair waited, dead center of the room.

The notebook sat open on the seat, pages fluttering in the stillness.

A pen leaned in the fold, ink trembling at the tip like sweat.

Something bright lay half-buried in dust near my boot.

I bent to pick it up, thinking maybe trash, but the curve of orange plastic stopped me cold.

The little pumpkin bucket had a jagged crack through its grin; candy wrappers stuck inside it like dried tongues.

For a second I convinced myself it wasn’t his… just another kid’s. There were thousands like it.

Then I saw the handle… bound with a strip of black electrical tape, the same fix I’d made after he dropped it on the sidewalk.

My stomach turned. The bucket slipped from my hand and rolled against the wall with a hollow knock.

The house sighed above me.

Weight shifted. One slow step. Another.

Something soft brushed my leg on the stair. A gray sleeve, limp, trailing the first step.

I touched it before I realized what it was. The fabric was still warm from skin.

Andrea’s hoodie.

The smell of her—powder and smoke—rose off it in a thin wave that hit me like a memory trying to claw its way out.

I dropped it and kept climbing, but the scent followed, clinging to the back of my throat.

The air grew heavier.

Every breath whistled in my chest.

Paint stuck to my palm.

Halfway up, a warm drop struck the back of my hand.

I froze.

A darker patch spread along the ceiling joist, threads running toward the wall.

The smell of iron filled my mouth.

At the landing, the hallway stretched wrong—doors pulled farther apart than they should be.

Only one showed light, a thin golden wedge along the floorboards.

I moved toward it.

The smell was stronger here.

Sweet rot, undercut by something electric.

I pushed the door open.

The bedroom glared too bright.

Curtains drawn, air unmoving, the light a bleached, buzzing color that hurt to look at.

Sheets tangled on the bed. A nightstand overturned.

Andrea lay in the center of the mattress.

Blood soaked through her blouse, the fabric stiff and dark. Her face—Christ—her face was half-collapsed, jaw slack as if unhinged. Most of her front teeth were gone. Her left eye bulged unnaturally from the socket, pushing forward like something inside was still straining to get out.

Then it hit me.

The memory.

The struggle.

Me gripping the fireplace poker so tight my knuckles turned white.

The first swing landed across her mouth with a wet crunch, scattering teeth like seeds.

The next was duller… thicker.

The third cracked through bone, and she fell back into the pillow, soundless.

I backed away from the bed, one hand over my mouth, bile rising fast.

 

I staggered from the room, stumbling through the hallway that seemed to breathe with me.

Halfway down, another door stood slightly ajar… smaller, painted blue, stickers peeling from its surface.

I hesitated, hand hovering over the knob. The air leaking from the gap was cold, carrying the faint smell of dust and rot.

I pushed it open.

It was a child’s room. Toys lay scattered across the rug, the walls faded with outlines where posters once hung. A toy car lay on the floor near the bed, wheels still spinning from the vibration of my steps, ticking softly in the quiet.

A small bed sat against the far wall. Kain was laying face down, the comforter was soaked red and stiff, his arm outstretched towards the door as if he tried to escape.

Then it hit me...

The memory tore through like a fever—his eyes widening, confusion breaking into fear, his voice shaking when he asked what I was doing.

The weight of the poker in my hands.

The snap of noise, the silence that followed, the last sound he made before everything went still.

And the way he tried to run.

My stomach turned. The air felt wrong, hot and sour.

I staggered back, vomit rising before I could fight it, spilling across the floorboards.

The acid taste burned my throat, mixing with the smell of iron and ash that clung to the room.

I wiped my mouth with a shaking hand, gasping, vision swimming.

I stumbled into the hallway, walls closing in on both sides.

The wallpaper brushed my arm, leaving red streaks where my fingers touched.

Downstairs, the bulb hummed louder… calling.

The chair was waiting when I reached the bottom.

The notebook had turned its own page. Fresh ink pressed deep enough to score, to almost tear the page.

Together, forever.

I sank to my knees.

“No,” I whispered. “I didn’t bring them here.”

The house exhaled through the walls—a low groan that felt almost like laughter.

Beside the candy bucket, half hidden in shadow, lay the gun.

I picked it up without thinking.

It was warm. Familiar.

I sat.

The chair gave a long, tired sigh.

Upstairs, something shifted.

One small creak of the mattress.

Or just the house, settling after the work was done.

The bulb steadied to a single, blinding pulse.

The words on the notebook glistened wetly.

Together, forever.

I traced them once, felt the grooves cut into my skin.

Then leaned back and let the chair hold my weight.

The light flickered.

Once.

Twice.

Then nothing.

A particularly infuriating flavor of this is when you understand something in a way different than intended, but still valid, and someone gives you advice of “if you didn’t understand this, you should have asked for help.” The issue is I was confident I understood it correctly.

I apologise if this is a dumb post but I tried to do some research and I have a feeling that asking on this sub will yield me the best answer. I will be graduating from university in 6 months here in the US, and don't have plans on staying here long term. I would really like to come to NZ/Australia, but I also know a lot of people have recommended that I get a masters in something specific to actually obtain a job (not just for NZ, but in the US as well as Europe). 

I wanted to ask, is it worth it looking for a job here with a health sciences degree as a US citizen?

I, 33f, have never had trouble finishing liquids. I've actually always craved drinks over food and would usually finish the whole cup in under 10 minutes. This goes for water, coffee, tea, soda.. and I would always want more very soon after. 

About a month ago, I noticed I've had increasing difficulty drinking anything. I will have a coffee in the morning and nurse it all day. I will drink a few sips of water when I used to finish my bottle by noon. I initially thought it could be that this year I started taking vyvanse for ADHD but that was back in May and I had no trouble with liquid until just recently. The only recent thing that happened is starting a new job but I can't seem to correlate the two. 

Could this be a symptom of something? When should I go to my doctor? I tried to search on Google but it kept assuming I meant alcohol LOL

For years, I hosted coworking sessions through it, small gatherings at cafés where freelancers, remote workers, and students could just show up, grab a coffee, and get stuff done together.

But over time, it started to feel like Meetup was drifting away from what made it great. The pricing changes, the clunky UX, and all the unnecessary friction made it harder to just… meet people.

Every simple thing, RSVPs, creating events, even messaging attendees, started feeling like work. And paying a monthly fee to host what’s essentially a few friends meeting up at a café? That didn’t sit right.

I wanted something that felt like Meetup used *to*: spontaneous, easy, human. So a friend and I decided to build our own take, a completely free, lightweight platform made specifically for coworking sessions.

It’s called [Drop In](https://dropin.place).  
You can host or join local coworking sessions, add live schedules, and people can RSVP instantly, no account needed.

No bloat. No subscription. Just people meeting, working, and reconnecting in real life, like Meetup was always meant to be.",2,1761957957.0,meetup,0,1.0,False

Figured no better place to ask than a subreddit dedicated to trains in NYC haha. Landed a new job in the last year which has me in the city a couple of times a month, and I’m often taking the LIRR and Metro North. It’s fascinating to me how everything seems to run so smoothly (for the most part).

How do they keep these trains clean throughout the day with so many passengers? I realize this is less true and a tougher task for inter-city trains that have a higher volume of passengers and basically run non stop. But take the LIRR for example, people eat and drink on the train. In the last month, I’ve seen two people accidentally spill coffee on the floor at their seat (I’m guilty of this once myself — did my best to clean it up with what I had). There’s no one to call while the train is moving to help clean it up. Train gets to Grand Central and it doesn’t seem like anyone comes to clean up before the train leaves again. Other passengers could slip and bust their a**. Do they really just clean trains once a day at the end of the day?

Also, I imagine people leave things behind on the train all the time. I saw someone leave a Kindle behind once on the Metro North, and another passenger gave it to the conductor. You’d like to hope most passengers would do the same, but others may be more opportunistic unfortunately. If you forget something on the train, do you basically just hope that someone is kind enough to turn it in to the lost and found? Or does the train crew do a spot check at the end of every run?

I have the most supportive partner who tries to do as much as possible to alleviate my stress and tiredness. He does all the chores and the cooking. My mum is amazing and supports me where she can. But gosh it's still so hard.   
  
Baby can't connect his sleep cycles during the day, so I'm putting him to sleep then 20 minutes later I'm rocking him again and repeat. I lose track of how long he actually slept or when his awake windows should be. I feel like i'm living in 20 minute increments. 80% of the time i can resettle him back into his nap. Sometimes I'm just so tired, I ask my partner to just hold him for a bit and resettle him back to sleep but he just cries on him. This makes sense cause my partner works full time and im at home, so naturally baby settles better on me. So baby just cries on him and he doesn't actually resettle. 

Baby also spits up alot, I've been holding him upright after his feeds and trying to actively burp him when he's awake. So maybe he's uncomfortable hence he can't connect the cycles? 

I've tried different swaddles, changing sleep location. Constant rocking / contact napping isn't sustainable for me in the long run cause i'm quite petite and baby is gaining weight (in a healthy way) and i feel like my arm is going to give out soon. 

We had latch issues previously and it got resolved but now theres another issue which i wont get into. 

But its just one thing after another. I miss the alone time with my partner that we used to have. I miss spending time with my dog, got alot of dog mum guilt. 

I miss going out and i want to. But i just dont have the confidence to just go out...and return to my pre-baby routines with baby, e.g. meeting some of my friends for coffee / lunch, going to a friends house to catchup with some friends. 

Not really looking for advice but also i am? I'm not sure what i wanted out of this post. Just needed a space to vent and be reassured it does get better? i hear its better at 3 months but then i read some reddit posts and it could be like up to a year?! I know others have it harder, and sometimes i feel like i'm just not strong enough for this.

1olaskx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1olaskx/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

one other person also working nearby. Even if we never talk. The accountability + 

presence of another human = I actually get shit done.



But here's the problem: I CAN'T FIND PEOPLE.



What I've tried:

\- Study group apps (dead communities or too structured)

\- Discord study servers (most are ghost towns)

\- Roommates/friends (never home when I am)

\- Coffee shops (expensive and still lonely)

\- Zoom calls with friends (works but they're all different timezones)

\- Study buddy subreddits (matched with 3 people, all ghosted)

What would actually help me:

Not a group project. Not a study group. Just... seeing that other people are 

studying RIGHT NOW and being able to join a ""study room"" for 2 hours and both 

just... do our thing. No talking required. No commitment. No flaking.

I know I can't be the only one who:

\- Studies way better with others present

\- Gets lonely studying alone but doesn't want forced social interaction

\- Needs accountability but flexibility

\- Wants study partners without the overhead of ""managing"" a group



Is there actually a tool like this? Or am I the only one with this specific problem?

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

I’m from Portugal and it’s my first time in Michigan, so I’d love to see what locals actually enjoy, not just the touristy stuff. I’ll be staying downtown and getting around mostly on foot or by Uber.

Thanks a lot, really looking forward to exploring!!

And honestly, one of the biggest headaches that hits me every single time isn't the coding or the pivots. It's the damn digital marketing grind, specifically: how the hell do you quickly whip up a promo poster to hype your new feature and get it out there?

You know the drill. You've just pushed a fresh update—maybe a slick new integration or a game-changing UI tweak—and you need to shout about it on socials, newsletters, or your site. But creating that one eye-catching poster? It's a nightmare. I used to rely on a UI designer buddy. I'd ping him with the product specs, ramble about potential selling points like ""Hey, this saves users 30% time!"" or ""It's super intuitive for noobs."" Then we'd go back and forth—drafts, feedback, tweaks. Days wasted, sometimes a week if he's swamped. And yeah, the final poster looks pro, but by then the momentum's gone. Your launch window? Poof.

It sucks even more when you're bootstrapping. Hiring a full-time designer? Not in the budget. Freelancers on Upwork? Hit or miss, and still that lag time. I've burned hours staring at Canva templates, trying to DIY it, only to end up with something that looks like a middle-school project. Meanwhile, competitors are flooding feeds with polished visuals, and I'm left thinking, ""How do they move so fast?""

Don't get me wrong, AI hype is everywhere—tools promising ""instant designs"" with a prompt. But most are trash for real marketing. You type in ""poster for productivity app,"" and it spits out generic crap that doesn't capture your unique angle. No context, no iteration without endless regenerations. I tried a bunch; they'd nail the colors but botch the messaging, or vice versa. Frustrating as hell.

Then I dove into AI agents. Not the fluffy chatbots—the real deal, autonomous systems that can reason and adapt. As a dev, I figured, why not build one tailored for this? So I did. It's a simple poster agent that guides you through a quick convo: asks about your product highlights, target audience, vibe you want (minimalist? Bold?). In like 10 seconds flat, it generates a solid poster—custom text, images, layout. Not always museum-worthy, but damn good enough to slap on LinkedIn or Twitter and drive clicks. I've used it for my last three launches, and it cut my marketing prep from days to minutes.

The key? Start small. Don't expect it to read your mind—feed it specifics via chat, and it refines on the fly. It's not replacing designers for big campaigns, but for agile founders like us? Game-changer. Saved me from that endless designer ping-pong.

If you're in the same boat, check it out at 1st comment. It's free to try, and it'll spit out your first poster before you finish your coffee.

Am I the only one who's been wrecked by this poster bottleneck, or are other indie devs/founders dealing with the same? What's your hack for quick marketing visuals? Curious to hear war stories from the trenches.",0,1761956564.0,AI_Agents,2,0.33,False

After I graduated, it seems that I got neither. They always told me that not everyone starts out with their dream job, and I finally understood that when I worked at my local grocery store for shit pay. I wasn’t ready to accept it then, even after 500 emails saying I didn’t fit the “matched” jobs, but I guess life had other options for me. The best I could ever do was land this one. Four years of earning my degree only to use my university level training in scanning products, weighting products, and dealing with customers. 

Things back home weren’t so good either. My parents got themselves into major financial debt just so that I could complete college. My dad was doing double shifts while my mom had to do three just to break even with the mortgage payments on top of it too. With me in that terrible job, it was the best I could do to contribute to them.

It wasn’t too bad though since I made a friend at the grocery store, his name was Victor. Loves Jesus as much as he loves horror movies. More than that, though, he was a beacon of hope to live on instead of just giving up. I even remembered speaking to my friend Victor about the latest movie we’d seen. It felt good to engage with him. It felt like a cushion to cope with the pandemonium of my post-college reality. Moreso by someone that understood me. The only warmth I felt in this dreary job was sharing a shift with him.

It was the day *she* showed up.

“So do you think that she got murdered in that shot?” he asked as he leaned over the checkout counter cross from me. From my perspective it felt like I was in a horror movie. The grocery store had a sickly yellowish white on the floors and everything else with build up of mildew seeping out of corners. The fluorescent lights buzzed and hummed as if they were a swarm of mosquitos. Yeah, I entertained the chances of this being my last shift.

“No way,” I replied. “I think it’s meant to leave people thinking.”

“Yeah that was what my girlfriend thought when we saw it.” He said as he scratched his chin hair. *My girlfriend*. My mind echoed those words. “So are you gonna go to that party I said about?”

“Oh yeah, that party. I’d be down!” I replied as I thought the idea of a fun, brief, nostalgic return to college life was helpful. I needed that return to something that made sense. Definitely better than being here for minimum wage. I didn’t notice that he was about to head out for the day.

When he clocked out and said his goodbye, my mind fell, again, into that familiar destitution. It was as if I was sinking deeper into an ocean of despair reaching conclusions like how I won’t be spending the rest of my life with someone *other* than my family. *My Girlfriend*. I had the notion that by sharing my life with someone I love and trust, things would be easier. I was naive to believe that, but I did back then. The congregation in my mind got into such heated feats of debate that I grew numb on the world around me. Eventually descending into despair. *How will this amount help my parents? Why can’t I just land a job that pays more? Why did Victor have to leave? Why am I so alone?* I wasn’t sure how long I was sinking like this. Minutes felt like hours here.

The remaining 30 minutes felt like I was in constant sleep paralysis. My eyes glazed and soggy as I got lost into the nihilistic nothingness that my mind could produce. All the while I heard the sounds of chattering customers whose breath smelled like what they ate, coworkers that were vexing imps, and a carousel of pop music that played over and over again. I heard the same 10 songs since the afternoon alongside the comforting smell of the store’s aroma of rotted vegetables and vinegar. David Bowie was singing for the 17th time before getting cut to another popular song reaching its own 17th.

While this was the most torturous amount of time spent that I’ll never recall the next day, it wasn't not all that bad. At this hour, the store would be barren of all the usual customers that you’d see. So, when a customer does show up, they'd tend to be the weirdest ones, and it was the most memorable part working late hours here for better or for worse. I felt the tapping of footsteps approaching my counter with their items of choice. I was about to open my mouth when the words got caught in my throat as the world disappeared when I saw … *her*.

I was not really that big into goth girls. I've only ever seen them online, so when I saw her, it really caught me off guard. She was a tall gothic princess; dominated in high heeled boots with silver strappings, making her about 6 ft tall. It led up to her long bluish-black dress that was only separated by both her snow white thighs and purple belt shaping her figure. Following up, her neck wore both a black choker and a silvery necklace that had a silver ankh attached to it. She also had some of those ankhs on her ear piercings, and it was only when I noticed her lip piercing did I get a good look at her face.

Her face was heart shaped with ivory soft skin, rosy cheeks, and maroon red lips which gave her look doll-like and innocent. She had her jet black hair tidied up to two high pigtails broken by strands of lavender to match her smell. Finally, I looked deep into her pale blue eyes that reminded me of the ocean. An endless sea crashing against the sand on a cloudy gray mourn. So hypnotic to just forget about all the dumb problems that anyone had to deal with in the cruel things life had to offer. A feeling so true to anyone in a grocery store uniform and apron.

I snapped back into reality as I was rushing to scan all of her items as she was just looking at me curiously. She didn’t say anything at all, just looked at me. It was kinda freaky, and it made me more nervous than I should. I never got that kind of attention at all. Especially from someone this beautiful.

“S-Shit, s-sorry ma’am. U-uuh, how was your night? Did anything interesting happen?” I asked as I was shoving an eggplant into a bag. Usually, I’d wait for other items that match its type for neatness. She didn’t respond. She had a solemn expression which made her lips look pouty and plump. Her eyes, however, showed the most activity. She kept looking at the groceries and mostly at me. Those pale blue eyes moved precisely like crashing waves; was she analyzing me? What was she trying to find in me?

It was hard not to look, but I had to focus on my job even as I felt the heat on my face and her stare when typing up the total. The store was spinning all around me, and I kept miscalculating the total and the cash she was giving me. I cursed when I dropped a dollar as I went to pick it up, I hastily opened the till and gave her her change as I met her pale beauty again.

I wanted to say something. Anything to make her say something. But I didn’t. I felt frozen there with the change in my hand as she took it, nodded and left. My eyes followed her until she was gone. I was allowed to breathe again as my heart was racing miles and my mind was running marathons with thoughts. *Who was she? I didn’t get time to get to know her. Is she single? Obviously she was not, since she looks gorgeous! BRO JUST LEAVE HER ALONE, she just wanted groceries.* I was able to clock out after 30 minutes, but she was long gone by then. I thought that I wouldn’t see her again. The notion left me wilted and went back to my car morosely. At the very least, I got something to talk about at that house party, I guess.

\*\*\*

Victor and I parked over to the house in some suburban place, and man, was this guy throwing a party. It was like a frat party. There was toilet paper thrown over the house and tree branches as if they were party ribbons and disco colors flashing on hues in cue with the pulsing, booming music that made anyone on a 20 mile radius want to call the police. People on the porch were either leaving because they were done or just puking up their drinks, and entering would walk slowly to record those puking. Me and Victor didn’t do it out of pity.

As if the outdoors wasn’t ravenous enough, it was truly a jungle when we entered inside. People were bouncing to the beat of the music blaring somewhere in this two story house. Guys laughing in friend groups and some trying to hit on some girls there. Some were even doing a drinking game with beer pong. Toilet paper around the ceiling fans and stair railings as it was outside, and a banquet of various chips and drinks. I helped myself with a drink and filled it with some soda - never get punch in parties - and it reminded me a bit about college life seeping in. My sinking mind was sidelined when Victor was shouting at me about something.

“What?” I shouted over the music.

“I said ‘so she just looked at you?” he replied.

“Jeez man, I didn’t know what to say at the moment,” I said as I sipped the last of my drink.

“I mean it’s okay man, people usually mess up at first,” he said as he took a swig. “But if you ever see her, just ask her out for some coffee! I mean who knows, \*hic\* maybe she’ll be here? This house seems big enough to fit the city in, so I guess she’d be here?”

“I don’t know man,” I said pensively, staring deep into the empty cup. I have seen other people say that that’s a good way to start. Maybe I’ll give it a try if I ever get that chance.

“Nah,” he said, putting a hand on my shoulder. “I’m sure she’ll show. Maybe someday, you’ll get to talk to her! Just ask her about a coffee date thing. Ya know? Anyway, \*hic\* I’m gonna find Lucy, she said she got in the house.” I ended up alone again as I looked around the room. As much as I wanted to, I couldn’t get her off my mind since that day.

*Maybe Victor was right. Maybe that goth girl would show up here*. I thought. Scoffing at the idea, I went to get more to drink my problems away. While I was pouring it in, I heard a husky  voice behind me say, “Hey, I’ve seen you before.” I turned around and my heart stopped. Paralyzed and clutching at the table, I looked and was petrified.

*Holy shit*. 

She no longer looked like a princess but she definitely dressed more for party fashion. Same boots but now with the addition of fishnet leggings to match her dark micro short jeans, a crop top, some band called TOOL. on it, and those same piercings on her ear and lip. She had her hair fixed in an updo which made her look a bit regal with loose lavender strands\*.\* She looked at me with those eyes that lit up in all colors from the party lights and the warm glow of the lights gave a magical touch in the air as I got my second chance. Her eyes widened to match mine, maybe a bit too playfully as her black lips formed a smile.

My mind was having a heated debate again, much to my exhaustion. *Yo, you gotta talk to her this time! No, leave her be, might be taken already! But why would she show up to him, again?!* The internal congregation in my mind ceased when I decided that this was my only chance to talk to her. I drank my fears, swallowed, and began to speak. It felt like a century just to say hi. She smiled. It became harder to say anything at that point. The party music was drowning, the walls closing in and my mind struggling to grope for something, anything to say.

“Y-y-yeah, the cashier guy.” I drawled long with a nervous gaping smile. *God, I’m so lame.* She snorted and smiled that deadly smile as she hid her mouth to take a sip of her drink; she filled in the awkward silence that followed.

“So, like, how long have you been working there?” She asked.

“Uhh, about a year now."" I said without realizing the pain. A year of this bullshit.

“Do you … like it there?” She seemed like she didn’t want to insinuate anything, but my face must have given her the answer. “Well, uhh, have you considered doing something else? A side hustle?"" She said as she smiled again. Teeth and all; Her canines were as perfect as she was.

“What are you getting at? I don’t even… ahh crap,” I said before realizing. I gave out my hand to her. “I’m Damian. Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.” I said as she took it. I didn’t expect her hand to be so cold. Maybe it was the AC in the party house.

“Madeline. But you can call me Maddy,” she said as she locked eyes on mine and said, “Damian.” The way she said it gave me a deeply bubbly feeling from my nave to my chest. I felt a bit better. I knew that she was trying to seduce me, but I guess not enough to pull me over.

“So, *Maddy*, what concert have you been to?” I said as suave as I can be. I guess talking about this TOOL band would be the best way to avoid the subject of my crashing career. She got deep into thought, as if to dig deep into her memory.

“Uhh, I have been to, I think, the one in Detroit, Michigan. I don’t remember the type of concert but it was when they weren’t as big as they are now. I haven’t been into concerts as much though.” She said.

“Have you been to Detroit? You moved in?” I said.

“Yeah, I thought I could start a new life here. Too hot over there, you know?.” She said as she fixed a part of her shirt. 

“I’m pretty sure Detroit was just as cold as here” I said.

She looked back at me. “Yeah it was to me at least. So how about you? Have you been to a concert?”

“Oh umm,” I thought hard. I rubbed the back of my neck while thinking about something to say. I didn’t know much about this band at all, but I didn’t want to sound like a wimp either. As I was thinking of something to say, I spotted both Victor and Lucy as they were watching me, Lucy giggling while Victory nodding his head with a grin of approval before waving at me. I turned to Madeline. “Uh Hey, I spotted my friends spying on us, you want to meet them?”

She snorted. “Sure, weirdo.”

I went over to where Victor and Lucy were. I introduced them to Madeline and likewise as we discussed further about metal bands. I shouldn’t be surprised that she was into horror movies to which Victor interrogated her about what her favorite scary movie was. She got us to talk about that movie again. Her take was interesting. She mentioned how the girl's wounds left untreated would cause her to die by exsanguination. I looked puzzled a bit.

“Since when did you take medical school?” Victor asked.

“I just think it's good to know the human body and how to treat it. You know?” Madeline replied. “My family and I work with blood donations and since my parents needed someone that can take up the day shift, I was the perfect choice. Say that reminds me,” She turned over to me. “We’re looking for someone to fill in a vacancy, and I was wondering if you’d like to sign up?”

I looked at her with shock. A job? Right, that side hustle she mentioned earlier. The more she described the role and benefits, the more I wanted to apply. It was definitely better than being just a grocery clerk. I thought of the potential amount of cash flowing in to help my aging parents. How proud they’d be of me that their son got a role that pays better.

“So where can I sign?” Victor added jokingly before I got to ask.

“Oh sorry, it’s only for one,” She said as she looked at me and gave me a business card. “I’d like to meet you at the bus’ location. I think you’d be a great fit for the role.”

I took the card she gave me as we continued talking. My head was in the sky amidst the noise as I held onto her card. This girl and her job offer lifted the gloom of my hometown as I realized that I can have my cake and eat it too. It came to an end as Victor shook me back to earth.

“Hey man come on now. We got work tomorrow, and I got to do something with my dad.” Shit, I forgot about that throughout all of this. So we were on our way out of the party, not nauseous at all, and as we did, Madeline said something that I always wanted to hear, and something that sealed my fate forever.

“Hey so like, do you want my number?”

That was how I met my girlfriend. I wish I never had\*.\*",1,1761956517.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

It seems very likely to be FH. I haven’t eaten red meat in five years and due to a different food sensitivity that has developed in the past year I have had almost no full-fat dairy (butter/milk/cream) in the past five months.

I am starting a statin presently, 40mg of atorvastatin was prescribed by my doctor, but I have asked to switch to rosuvastatin due to using THC on occasion (I know that that could potentially be bad for my cholesterol, but it helps with my anxiety and other issues I have with ruminating and fixating). I do drink about 4-6 drinks per week (I know that isn’t great for my cholesterol either), but am cutting back and swapping in NA beers. My cholesterol wasn’t great when I had it checked before I ever started drinking or using edibles back when I was a teenager/early 20s.

On the other hand, I take glucomannan fiber daily and Metamucil gummies and I get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise six to seven days per week. Plus, I eat three to four servings of fruits and vegetables and legumes daily. I limit junk food and sweets to maybe once or twice per week and I don’t drink soda or any type of other soft drink. The only non-alcohol I drink is water, black coffee, and unsweet tea. About two years ago I dropped 25 pounds from 230 to 205 and have kept the weight off.

Mostly, I just feel like my numbers are terrible and there aren’t many more things I can do to improve them, and I am feeling a lot of anxiety about getting them lower and would love to hear any success stories from people in similar situations or who think that improving my cholesterol is very doable and I am overreacting. My doctor is very chill and laid back, which I appreciate because judgmental and rude doctors are why I stopped going for about ten years, but she also didn’t give me a great idea of how scared I should be, thanks for any input!

Here are my numbers:

Cholesterol normal levels—279 in June, 257 now

HDL—37 in June, 34 now

Non-fasting triglycerides—346 June, 420 now

LDL-C—183 in June, unreadable now

HDLC Ratio—7.5 in June, 7.6 now

NonHDL Cholesterol—242 in June, 223 now


I know they are crazy high. But my blood sugar and sodium and everything else is normal.

Just a handful of remote workers or freelancers meeting up, working quietly together, chatting a bit over coffee during breaks. The productivity and sense of connection skyrocketed. It reminded me why I loved the buzz of an office in the first place.

I used to host these sessions on Meetup, but the experience slowly became too heavy, expensive, clunky, and overcomplicated for what was meant to be simple. So, a friend and I teamed up to create a lightweight, free alternative made *just* for coworking meetups.

Now you probably read the title and wondering how could a great holiday on your birthday be… complicated?

Well I need to give a little context.

As I’m sure most of you are aware I’m a dragon rights advocate. I fight against the mistreatment of dragon. Most of the things people blame on dragons are either so lost in time or not even really their fault.

People love to point out how the “god of destruction” is a dragon when he’s currently sitting around our planet making eco friendly coffee.

Anyway, it’s a big thing in my life and that’s the context I want to give.

So where it really starts is well… Halloween of your guy’s year. (It’s 2027 my time)

It’s my birthday still right, so we start our day with my party so we can actually do all the Halloween stuff at night.

So I’m in my friend’s mansion and I look out the window and I see three people.

None of us know who these people are but one of them is human (at least think so) he’s got this really purple hair that stands out with this blue winter coat on, the other two.

Well one’s a wolf guy with a similar shade of purple to the human guy’s hair. I don’t know if they are related or not but they seem to be in a very heated argument.

Now the last guy his name is Phoenix. Ironically he’s a Demi-human of a Phoenix, go figure.

Anyway that guy he’s great, I’ll get into that shortly.

The purple hair guy, he looks kinda fed up I guess? I’m not too sure but after Phoenix shows up he kinda leaves? 

Very strange.

Even more so the wolf guy looks quite confused before handing something to Phoenix and leaving himself.

Now obviously I’m so confused so I walk out there and well Phoenix seems just about as lost as me so not very helpful.

So I just introduce myself yada yada.

And he offers to help me fight for dragon rights and to put it shortly he’s amazing at speaking. I promise you he does in nearly a month. I’ve been fighting for years I mean… he just knows exactly what to say.

Now this also ties into Christmas that year. Where once again I’m having a party with all my friends Phoenix now included obviously.

What I was unaware of was that somebody was trying to sabotage my party. 

Now I’ll admit part of this is probably my fault but nonetheless this mysterious person spikes my punch cup. Now I should make it clear I never drank a day in my life I just couldn’t so this one cup is enough to get me stupid.

Unfortunately I wind up saying a bunch of really mean spirited things about dragon that honestly I don’t even remember saying.

The only reason I know for a fact it happened was because this mysterious person actually recorded all of it.

Next thing I know it’s trending and I’m in a bad spot, but it gets worse this mysterious person even **SUES ME!**

I mean it really doesn’t get worse than that.

**Except it does!**

Turns out it’s that guy with purple hair I saw on Halloween. I guess his hair is just naturally that color.

But it gets even weirder with this guy is what I can only describe as very weird reflection of myself.

You know when you go to a carnival and you stand in front of a wacky mirror that stretches you out. 

Yeah? Well that’s basically what I’m looking at.

It’s clearly suppose to be me but he’s like a foot taller with 4 arms and honestly putting it nicely he’s not the prettiest to look at.

So yeah I’m being sued by some seemingly power guy and twisted version of myself.

Lucky Phoenix stepped in to help and this blue Captain guy. I think he said his name was Proto. Great guy as well.

So it’s roughly the next year and I’m sitting in a court room (which by the way is like in some other dimension or something… idk they said something about galactic law I don’t even know where to begin so I won’t) 

Anyway I’m with Phoenix and Proto and everything I would say is going smooth till…

**CRASH!**

We all turn and look and see what is quite literally a spaceship that seemingly full speed crashed into the court room. (I’m serious)

Now before anyone could respond this red Protogen jumps out gives the nastiest stare I’ve ever seen at Proto and kinda just invites himself into the prosecution.

So now everyone is a little confused and looking over even the purple hair guy seems a little annoyed.

I would later figure out this guy was Otorp apparently an evil clone to Proto. Turns out the guy has no court experience whatsoever and was only there for Proto…

Well the entire court trial is now a mess. Proto seems a bit… lost… Phoenix is trying to help him but it doesn’t seem to be working and that Otorp guy… he’s going on some tangent that seems completely unrelated.

So you know what, nothing happened! We all kinda just got kicked out the trial.

Luckily for me I was able to bounce back. A few poorly chosen drunk words didn’t get me cancelled despite the effort of two people I thought I didn’t know.

Reason why I say thought is apparently, I’ve learned this twisted me has a history with this purple hair guy.

That twisted me is actually a me from a different timeline!

So to explain remember when I said I saw some people out my window?

Apparently Phoenix wasn’t there for this Felix and so the purple hair guy apparently just blew up Kysto’s entire mansion (Kysto being my friend obviously)

Now you think that’s crazy? Turns out that me is technically not an original me.

Let me explain. Apparently killing me caused a serious chain reaction that stared a nuclear war… don’t ask I’m just as dumbfounded.

But point is that Felix is actually a mutated radioactive clone of me. That’s why he looks so strange with his extra height and arms.

So yeah safe to say it’s really got me confused and kinda gives me a bad taste in my mouthing knowing that Halloween could’ve been my last.

Part of me thinks that, that Felix probably wasn’t the first one to die by that purple guy’s hands.

I don’t know he just… rubs me the wrong way. It’s like he just hates me for no reason. Well not a reason I know.

Oh and I couldn’t find a good way to add this on but it is important.

The twisted Felix was actually the one who spiked my drink and you wanna know why?

Because apparently Phoenix solved dragon rights too fast?

I’m serious. He was talking all this nonsense about how I’m “A useless activist if some random bird can do years worth of public speaking for dragon in only a month.”

I’ll give him that. Phoenix did shock me with how fast he got people on our side but to call me **useless**, I’m genuinely hurt.

So yeah like I said Halloween kinda has sour taste in my mouth now which is sad cuz I still really really like the Holliday but I know I have the constant feeling of being watched and it doesn’t go away.

I wake to the sound of paws on the floorboards.

“Max, bitte…” I mumble into the pillow. It’s too bright already; the thin curtains can’t hold back the Berlin sun. My head is pounding. I shouldn’t have had that last beer.

Max’s nails click closer. Then a wet nose presses against my cheek, a low whine that means breakfast or walk, choose one.

“Alright, alright, you tyrant.”

I swing my legs over the bed, feel the cold wood, and instantly regret existing. The apartment smells faintly of coffee grounds and dog fur, the two constants of my life. Posters peel from the walls, Freiheit für Tiere!, Science ≠ Suffering! my idealism laminated in cheap ink. A half-finished protest sign leans in the corner beside an old cactus.

I shuffle toward the bathroom. The handle sticks, as always.

“Verdammte… push, come on” using my strength i lean in and with enough effort It gives with a sharp creak.

Then I’m on my knees retching, reaching for the toilet but then i gag up foam and acid. I miss. It splashes on the tile. “Scheiße.”

Max watches from the doorway, ears tilted, confused sympathy in his eyes. “Don’t look at me like that.” I grab paper towels, mop up, dump everything in the bin, rinse my mouth, and smile at the ridiculousness of it all.

Coffee first. Then redemption.

The Message

By the time the caffeine hits, I feel almost human again. I scroll through my phone.
There it is the encrypted chat Green Vein.
Anja: Mila, Tonight. 22:00. Tiergarten station. Bring gloves.

Beneath it: a link Novaprax Biotechnik leaked documents.

I open the file. Scans of research memos, grant proposals, photos of white corridors. One phrase repeats: “Behavioural Control via Selective Aggression & Passivity Modulation in Mammalia.”

I mutter, “Selective aggression, my ass.”

They call it pest control, population management. We call it cruelty.

Max noses my knee, demanding attention. “You’d hate them too, huh?”

He yawns. I laugh. I scroll further rumors about trials on stray dogs in Brandenburg. That hits harder than it should.

Outside, trams rattle by. Berlin hums, indifferent. I sip cold coffee and think about Anja’s last voice message: “We just need proof. People listen when they see cages.”

Tonight, we’ll break in. Photograph everything. Leave. No damage. Just truth.

At least, that’s the plan.


---

Afternoon

The sun burns pale gold through clouds. I clip Max’s leash, pocket my earbuds, and step outside.

It’s one of those perfect days... warm, breezy, alive. Kids chase pigeons near the canal; an old man sells strawberries by the bridge. For a moment, the world feels exactly right.

We cut through Tiergarten. The air smells of rain and grass. Max bounds ahead, tail flagging. I throw a stick; he sprints after it, tongue lolling, pure joy.

A woman with a dachshund smiles at me. “Er ist sehr brav.”

“He tries.”

She laughs, moves on. I watch Max wrestle the stick out of a puddle, proud of his triumph. It hits me how much I love this stupid dog. He’s my family, my roommate, my sanity, the only kumpel that truly understands me.

As we walk home, he shakes off water all over my jeans. I groan. “Unbelievable.” He looks smug. I scratch his head anyway.

For a heartbeat I think: maybe skip tonight. Maybe stay home. But then I remember those lab photos, the tags on animal ears. Someone has to care.


---

Night

Rain starts as I leave. It patters soft against my hood, misting the empty streets.

The Tiergarten station glows dimly, reflected in puddles. Six of us wait beneath the bridge with Anja and Felix standing together, two students I don’t know, a wiry man named Leo who brought the tools.

No one talks much. Only the rain and the low hiss of car tires on wet asphalt.

We drive east, past the city lights, into the dark countryside. Brandenburg’s flat fields stretch forever. Windmills turn like ghosts.

The facility rises from the fog, cold, concrete, sterile, ringed with fences. No guards visible. Just floodlights and cameras.

Leo cuts the wire with a hiss. We crawl through, hearts hammering. Inside: warehouses, shipping crates, ventilation ducts breathing steam.

A keypad door yields to Felix’s stolen code. Cold fluorescent light washes over us.

At first, we didn’t even know what we were looking at. The room was lined with cages, floor to ceiling, but not the kind you’d expect from an abuse exposé. Everything gleamed under white fluorescent lights. Stainless steel, spotless floors, filtered air humming quietly from vents above.

Inside the cages were monkeys, capuchins, a few macaques just watching us with steady, unblinking eyes. Their fur was clean. They had food. Water. Even toys.

It was unnerving, how calm they were.

I stepped closer to one of them, crouched until we were eye level. He didn’t shrink back, didn’t show a single flinch of fear. Just blinked at me, slow, deliberate, like he understood that I shouldn’t be here.

“No trauma response,” I muttered, frowning. “That doesn’t make sense.”

Felix’s voice pulled us away. He’d found a terminal still glowing green in the corner, stacks of printed notes scattered beside it. The paper rustled as he flipped through. His expression changed, first confusion, then a flash of alarm.

“These apes aren’t the test subjects,” he said, his voice suddenly low, tense. “They’re controls. Baseline samples to make sure there’s no risk of primate infection symptoms.”

“What?” Elke asked.

He swallowed. “They’re testing something they already know doesn’t affect us. Humans. Primates. That’s why these ones look so... fine.”

A chill crept down my spine.

At the far end of the room, a set of clear PVC strip curtains swayed gently in the recycled air. A rhythmic mechanical hum pulsed beyond them, steady, rhythmic, like a heartbeat amplified through metal.

I didn’t wait for anyone else. I just ran.

The plastic strips slapped against my shoulders as I burst through and then froze.

Rows. Endless rows of cages, each lit by cold surgical lamps. Rabbits. Raccoons. Dogs. All sedated, motionless, their chests rising shallowly. Tubes threaded into veins, monitors flashing tiny green heartbeats. Charts hung from clipboards, each stamped with a single block code: RFX.

Anja’s whisper trembled. “Take pictures. Fast.”

My hands shook as I pulled out my phone. Through the camera lens, the world looked even more wrong. The sterile white light, the gleam of steel, the limp bodies breathing because machines told them to.

A red-taped door stood at the back, the paint chipped where someone had scraped at it. RFX: Mammal Behaviour Control Trials.

Otto adjusted his glasses, eyes darting over the cages. “There’s only mammals here... why?”

Elke pressed her hand to her mouth, her voice breaking. “What the hell is this?”

The machines just kept humming.

And for the first time I realized we weren’t here to uncover abuse. We were standing in the middle of something that wasn’t supposed to exist.

Before anyone answers, Leo smashes the lock. The door swings open.

Inside, glass cylinders filled with pale fluid hum like beehives. The air smells metallic, sharp. Screens blink with genetic code.

Anja lifts her camera. Flash.

Something bursts, a pipe as the nozzle came loose a mist of red vapor sprays across us. My eyes sting; I cough violently.

“Scheiße! Back out! Back out! This it the real thing!”

Alarms blare. Red lights strobe.

We scatter, crashing into corridors, slipping on wet tiles. I grab the railing, slick with the same reddish residue. My glove tears.

Outside, rain slaps my face. We run through mud, headlights flashing in the distance, most definitely security or even police.

By the time I reach the car, my lungs burn. My jacket sticks to my skin.

We split up at the city limits. I take the U-Bahn home alone, still trembling, the smell of iron in my nose.


---

Home

The apartment feels unreal, too small, too quiet for my racing mind.

But then Max barks once, joyous. He jumps up, paws on my chest. I hug him, half-crying, half-laughing. “You won’t believe the day I had.”

I toss my soaked jacket and gloves in a heap by the door. I’ll wash them tomorrow.

Shower first. The water runs pink as the rain. I tell myself it’s dye, nothing more.

When I step out, the mirror fogs over. My skin tingles faintly, but I chalk it up to nerves.

Max is sniffing the jacket pile, whining softly. “Hey, don’t chew that,” I warn, nudging him away. He obeys, tail wagging uncertainly.

I pour cereal, eat standing up. My eyes sting from exhaustion.

“Good night, Max,” I murmur, patting his head. He licks my fingers, then pads to his blanket by the door.

I collapse onto the bed and drift.


---

The Sound

Scratching.

At first it folds into the dream, leaves on a window, wind through branches.

Then louder. Rhythmic. Wood against metal.

I open my eyes. The room is black except for the faint LED glow of the alarm clock. 3:42 a.m.

“Max?”

No answer.

The scratching comes again, from the hallway. Then a low growl, wet, guttural, unfamiliar...

I sit up, heart thudding. “Max, was ist los?”

Something bumps the bedroom door. A soft whine. Then silence.

I get up slowly, bare feet on cold floor, and reach for the handle.


---

The Dog

“Max, are you—”

The door cracks open.

He’s crouched there, shoulders twitching, chest heaving. His fur clings damp to his body, eyes red and swollen, pupils tiny pinpoints. Drool hangs in ropes from his mouth.

For a second I freeze, thinking he’s sick, poisoned maybe. “Oh, Gott, Max, what happened—”

He lunges.

The door slams into my arm; teeth close on skin. Pain flares, hot and bright. I scream and shove, catching the edge of the frame. Blood sprays.

He thrashes, snarling, forcing his way through the gap. I slam the door again, but his strength is unreal.

“Stop! Max, stop!”

He doesn’t hear. He doesn’t even blink.

I break free, stumble backward through the kitchen. My arm is dripping. The tiles blur.

He charges, claws skittering, jaws snapping. I grab a chair and swing it. Wood splinters against his flank. He yelps, then growls deeper, madder.

“Please, Max…” My voice cracks.

He circles, panting, eyes locked on me like prey.


---

The Bathroom!

The only door that locks, the bathroom...

I dash for it, lungs burning. My blood leaves streaks on the wall.

Behind me, the crash of claws, the hiss of breath, rabid barking i had only seen on gore site videos or rabies documentaries.

I barley shut the rotten passage way door as Max smashed against it with predatory fury.

I reach the handle. It sticks.

“No, no, not now.”

I press down, but my fingers tremble. The metal feels slick. The lever barely moves.

I shove harder with all my might, shoulder against the frame. Nothing.

He hits the door; it jolts. The wood cracks.

I try again, but my arm gives out, the bitten one. Numb now. Weak.

I sob, pushing with all I have. The handle still won’t budge as i collapse, my legs giving way.

The door groans once more, then splinters inward.

Something heavy slams into me.


---

The Mauling

I instantly feel excruciating pain as my once best friend bites into me, ragging like a crocodilian during a death roll ripping my flesh, an agonizing buring sensation all throughout my body, spreading fast. The world shrinks to noise: claws, snarls, my own heartbeat drumming out as i gradually lose the strength... freedom to move as if the venom of a komodo dragon is coursing through my veins.

The hall light flickers. The rusted handle of the bathroom gleams dully, my hand twitching as Max feasts upon me as his last supper.

I think of Tiergarten, of sunlight and grass, of Max rolling on his back while children laughed.

Then there’s only dark.

1ol9veq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ol9veq,Need advice regarding wether surgery could be beneficial,"I have had sleep issues for quite some time now, despite doing everything correctly. For example, I exercise 6 times a week, have a perfect diet, read before bed, don't eat a couple of hours before bed and the list goes on.

Despite this, for the past 2 years even when I've slept long enough and done everything correctly I still have a lot of brain fog. For example, if I try to do a mentally draining task for 20-30 minutes (such as a math problem) I feel as if I have just completed the hardest test in the world and I cannot remember basic things. Coffee has fixed this issue partly but then again it does not actually fix the issue at hand.

No, it was not like this before. For context, I'm 18 years old now and when I was 15-16 I would sleep less not exercise and use my phone before bed. But, I had much more mental energy than I do now, making me think that something has changed and one of the factors that I think it could be could be my recessed chin, leading to sleep complications. 

I sleep with my mouth open (as I've noticed from pictures from others) and have also been told from others that I snore occasionally, making me think I could have sleep apnea or some obstruction of some sort? That could be causing these issues..

One more important thing is that I've also had braces with the bands (although I barely used the bands) during ages 13-16, therefore yes I also have seen a orthodontist and have numerous scans done (but it's been a year or so since I last talked to them). This is also why I'm posting here instead of reaching out to them since I think they would have told me about this if it had been an issue (but I would still appreciate second thoughts as this issue has been affecting my life quite a lot and I'm trying to look into every single possible cause). I also still do have a very noticeable overbite. 

  
Therefore if anyone here is able to provide their thoughts on the situation I would be very grateful, as I'm considering looking further into this and actually reaching out to my orthodontist to get their thoughts. ",1,1761954599.0,jawsurgery,2,1.0,False

1ol9t40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ol9t40/crush_started_seeing_someone_dont_know_how_to/,Crush started seeing someone… don’t know how to feel? Advice/opinions welcomed!,"I just wanted to start by saying that this is my first (and probably last) ever post, so please be nice!! 

Basically here goes: (it’s a bit long sorry, but I really would appreciate some advice from people, maybe from people older and more experienced as well)

- For context, I’m 19f and my crush is 28m (silly, I know, but please hear me out). Basically I’m a little bit disappointed because I found out recently that he has been seeing someone. We are in the same uni course together and I’ve known him now for around 9months. We became pretty good friends off the bat and we’ve hung out quite a bit doing trips, going for coffee and studying together lot etc. Realistically I always knew nothing would ever come of it due to the difference in age and life experience/stage of life, but I guess I kinda liked indulging in the fantasy and the attention he gave me. 

I more so than anything would just like peoples opinions on his perspective, and advice on what to do moving forward because I feel a little bit lead on, and I’m not really sure whether I have a right to feel upset with him and whether he’s actually done anything wrong in this case or not, or whether I’m just being an immature young person as per usual. 

I feel a little bit strung along. I’m pretty sure he knew I was into him (he’s made a few comments over time, like once he mentioned how my pupils are always very dilated around him, and another time he commented when I tried on his mood ring about how the colour either indicated I was nervous or in love). Whenever we would sit next to each other to study he would always lean in until we were brushing against each other and we would linger like that for ages. Other things he would say that I found quite intimate were things like saying “don’t be nervous, it’s just me” when I was nervous to do something around him, and how he was impressed at how I could talk about things when he met me. When we hung out one on one he was always quite touchy, but a bit more reserved around others. He is quite friendly naturally, so was this just normal friendly behaviour on his part, or was he flirting with me? All of this was before he started seeing someone obviously. Then his energy shifted a bit, and the only reason I even found out he was seeing someone was because a flirty text popped up on his phone from a girl when he was showing me something on his phone one day. Because he’s never outright said he’s seeing anyone, I don’t know how to address it with him (and because it’s not actually my business). I just feel crushed. 

I know I need to back off now for my own sake, and for his relationship. While I know it wouldn’t have impacted anything between us whether he was seeing someone or not, should he have set clearer boundaries with me from the start? I doubt he was fully socially unaware at his age, and he’s quite switched on, but I can’t 100% be sure this isn’t all in my head. I just feel that because his energy switched and he stopped being so touchy and saying more emotionally charged things that he had to have had some level of awareness of how the things he was doing were impacting me, and their implications. I was going to have a conversation and confess to him in order to set a boundary of where we stand and to give him a reason for backing off a bit, by telling him I feel a bit lead on and jealous when I’m around him, but would that be manipulative on my part by putting him in an awkward position? I don’t have any hope/expectations from him if I had that conversation, but I feel a bit angry and used. If it turned out this whole time he really has been unaware then I just sound even more ridiculous than I already feel. For reference we will be in the same class for the next two years finishing our course, so that adds another layer because I don’t know how to navigate this. Would saying something make it awkward moving forward and destroy any friendship we still have? Would it be unfair to say something while he’s in a relationship even if my reasons are legitimate?

Please be kind, I just don’t know what to do :)

Kevin and I stand about a block away from her home. The early morning sun shines low, casting long shadows over the slight chill hovering over the sidewalk.

“I love her, but she keeps changing her mind about…Michael.” He nods behind me.

He started walking, but stopped in his tracks. 

I grab his hand. “What’s wrong?”

He stares over my shoulder with eyes wide and brows curled inward.

“Kevin?” I ask, turning around. “Who’s-”

A woman stands on one leg, neck slumped backward, mouth hanging open.

She moans like she’s about to vomit, gagging and sputtering with bubbles caught in her throat. Her head flops forward like a doll head.

We step backward as she jaggedly staggers closer. With each step, she pulls her leg up like a flamingo. Her curly blonde hair dangling over bulging eyes glaring back at Kevin.

She jolts into a sprint, tackling Kevin’s shoulder making him stumble.

“The fuck was that?”

“Let’s go back to Kelly’s.” I mutter, still staring at the shambling woman.

We tell Kelly what happened over a hot pot of coffee. My mug brings warmth back into my hands.

“How’s your shoulder?” She asks, concern painting her words.

“It’s aching longer than it should. She just bumped it, but it’s like I just hung from something for hours and hours. It tingles like it’s fallen asleep.”

He rubs his shoulder, squeezing it and rolling it around in wide circles.

“Want to go see Dr. Ledlow? I can call him to see if he has an opening.”

“Nah, I don’t want to bother her. Anyways, I don’t think she’d be back to work yet.”

“Oh, yeah. I hope she’s doing alright. Didn’t her dad just pass away?”

“Yeah, he suffered through Alzheimer’s and dementia for quite a while.”

“How do you know that much about your doctor?” Kelly asks.

“She’s been my family doctor since I was a teen. Well before I met Mikey.”

We smile at each other. His dark brown brown eyes slightly crinkle with crows feet.

He closes his eyes, stretching his neck away from his shoulder with a groan.

“She was tiny, too. Not much smaller than you.” He laments.

“I can still hear her feet scraping across the sidewalk, screaming in my ear as she passed by.”

“Screaming? She didn’t scream?”

“What do you mean? She wailed like a hungry baby.”

“All I heard was that creepy croaking. Sounded like blowing into milk through a straw.”

“It gave me a migraine. She screeched. Shrieked like a dying banshee.”

“I’m going to call Dr. Ledlow.”

I swallow, pulling my phone out of my pocket. A shiver rakes down my spine.

My phone clangs on the floor.

“Kevin…?”

The sound of a stomach growling blubbers out of his throat as spittle dribbles out of his mouth.

1ol9lzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1ol9lzk/ive_realized_that_real_life_is_inherently_mundane/,I've realized that real life is inherently mundane and disappointing at best and straight-up terrifying and nightmarish at worst,"Last year or two has been pretty rough on me. Chronic illness diagnosis, parents falling to illnesses, chronic loneliness (since 8), and quarter-life crisis hitting me like a truck...... You name it.

I grew up with very controlling, overprotective, sheltering, and strict parents. No friends, no dates, bullied at school, binge-eating disorder, and pretty much missed out on every formative experience and milestone a human is supposed to have during their teenage years.

Growing up, I pretty much lived in the future to cope with the suck. ""One day in the future, I will finally be able to escape the rut and live an adventurous life to the fullest"", I used to tell myself. ""I will have a cool crowd of friends, a cute (she doesn't even have to be hot) girlfriend, and a cool life filled with adventures. I will make up for the lost time the universe robbed from me during my teenage and young adult years"".

But that never happened. While I did get my career nailed down and got to embark on a lucrative IT career (thanks to my parents and education), life became work-eat-sleep-repeat. Zero friends. Zero extracurricular activities. Zero interaction with women (except for polite exchanges with the cashier or professional discussions with several woman coworkers I work with who are all at least 15 years older than me).

Do you know they have a saying in Mandarin? 兩點一線. Translated literally as ""two dots one line"", it describes a life where one travels between only home and work (two dots) without going to other places (hence the one line, aka the one path only between home and work). This saying describes my life perfectly.

I have always longed for adventure since childhood, and I've always loved to watch other people's lives on social media and YouTube. Personally, my favorite has been Shiey and Logan Paul. But the more I lived, the more I realized that in the end, there is no adventure in our perfectly mundane and disappointing existence.

There is no Hogwarts ticket coming your way. There is no Gandalf, let alone some Isekai bullshit. Even the so-called adventurous and fun lives I see people post on social media are mostly that, posts carefully curated to sell you a dream and unrealistic expectations of a better and more exciting existence. The travels, parties, relationships, adventures, fun escapades, and such? All is not real and made up. Instead, just like me, they live perfectly mundane and disappointing lives and grapple with terrifying and nightmarish curveballs life throws in every person's way sooner or later (illnesses and such).

I've finally learnt to appreciate the small things: a bottle of Zero Coke, a warm bento after work, a cool or funny post from social media after a lonely day of work. Although I know that social media is not real, I still relish in the dream that it is real. After all, social media sells you a dream of a better existence. Same for books, movies, games, anime, and all sorts of fiction that we humans produce and consume. Hell, even porn sells you a dream for a better sex life than the mundane and disappointing reality that is.

For all these years, I've always asked myself. Is this my life? My mundane, joyless, disappointing existence... is there all it is? Where's the adventure? The excitement? The relationships? The adrenaline rush? But now I've come to realize that real life is inherently mundane and disappointing, and that is exactly why fiction and escapism have existed since antiquity, when we talked of legendary heroes going on adventures and performing feats that are impossible in real life.

It is a very humbling and grounding realization that work-eat-sleep-repeat is the default for all of us humans, and that there is no grander adventure or fun that awaits us other than the terrifying curveballs life likes to occasionally throw our way. As for the loneliness, FOMO since childhood, and restlessness of feeling that I'm not living life to the fullest? Unfortunately, that is also the nature of real life.

There are no mischievous childhood escapedes where you and your childhood friends sneak into places you aren't supposed to go to; there are no grand teenage adventures where you make out with your teenage girlfriend who deliberately dressed up in an extra skimpy outfit just for you in an abandoned building while you drink beer and count the stars; there are no cool friendships of where you and your comrades go explore the most remote and uninhabited regions in the world; hell, there aren't even fun parties where you can laugh away at your hearts content while you fumblingly attemp to impress your giggling crush with the latest magic trick you've learnt online.

None, those are dreams and unrealistic expectations only that are sold to us via social media and fiction. What is in reality is instead acceptance of the mundane and disappointing nature of life while making peace with it by finding joy in the mundane through the small things we have in life.

Chronic illness diagnosis, parents falling to illnesses, chronic loneliness (since 8), and quarter-life crisis hitting me like a truck...... You name it.

I grew up with very controlling, overprotective, sheltering, and strict parents. No friends, no dates, bullied at school, binge-eating disorder, and pretty much missed out on every formative experience and milestone a human is supposed to have during their teenage years.

Growing up, I pretty much lived in the future to cope with the suck. ""One day in the future, I will finally be able to escape the rut and live an adventurous life to the fullest"", I used to tell myself. ""I will have a cool crowd of friends, a cute (she doesn't even have to be hot) girlfriend, and a cool life filled with adventures. I will make up for the lost time the universe robbed from me during my teenage and young adult years"".

But that never happened. While I did get my career nailed down and got to embark on a lucrative IT career (thanks to my parents and education), life became work-eat-sleep-repeat. Zero friends. Zero extracurricular activities. Zero interaction with women (except for polite exchanges with the cashier or professional discussions with several woman coworkers I work with who are all at least 15 years older than me).

Do you know they have a saying in Mandarin? 兩點一線. Translated literally as ""two dots one line"", it describes a life where one travels between only home and work (two dots) without going to other places (hence the one line, aka the one path only between home and work). This saying describes my life perfectly.

I have always longed for adventure since childhood, and I've always loved to watch other people's lives on social media and YouTube. Personally, my favorite has been Shiey and Logan Paul. But the more I lived, the more I realized that in the end, there is no adventure in our perfectly mundane and disappointing existence.

There is no Hogwarts ticket coming your way. There is no Gandalf, let alone some Isekai bullshit. Even the so-called adventurous and fun lives I see people post on social media are mostly that, posts carefully curated to sell you a dream and unrealistic expectations of a better and more exciting existence. The travels, parties, relationships, adventures, fun escapades, and such? All is not real and made up. Instead, just like me, they live perfectly mundane and disappointing lives and grapple with terrifying and nightmarish curveballs life throws in every person's way sooner or later (illnesses and such).

I've finally learnt to appreciate the small things: a bottle of Zero Coke, a warm bento after work, a cool or funny post from social media after a lonely day of work. Although I know that social media is not real, I still relish in the dream that it is real. After all, social media sells you a dream of a better existence. Same for books, movies, games, anime, and all sorts of fiction that we humans produce and consume. Hell, even porn sells you a dream for a better sex life than the mundane and disappointing reality that is.

For all these years, I've always asked myself. Is this my life? My mundane, joyless, disappointing existence... is there all it is? Where's the adventure? The excitement? The relationships? The adrenaline rush? But now I've come to realize that real life is inherently mundane and disappointing, and that is exactly why fiction and escapism have existed since antiquity, when we talked of legendary heroes going on adventures and performing feats that are impossible in real life.

It is a very humbling and grounding realization that work-eat-sleep-repeat is the default for all of us humans, and that there is no grander adventure or fun that awaits us other than the terrifying curveballs life likes to occasionally throw our way.

Pretty soon after coming home I had to restart my social media presence after loosing my original instagram account (phishing scheme which I was really dumb to fall for), and as such sent out friend requests and explanations to everyone I had remembered that I followed. 

One of those people 23F was a girl who I was really close with when I was younger, and after we reconnected due to the account thing, we ended up texting each other almost daily for like two/three months. The conversations were occasionally pretty intimate, with us opening up about our passions and life experiences since we had last talked. Eventually, the girl ended her relationship with her college partner, and told me the night of, explaining the reasoning for such a decision relating to him not being completely honest with her and not taking her personal interests/artistic passions seriously. Much of our conversation after this reveal was her flirtatiously talking about how ‘she doesn’t really want to enter the dating market (using dating apps)’/‘how she thought my own insecurity about my height was something which shouldn’t turn off a woman’/‘how she appreciates me being a safe space for her.’

I kinda played it off as friendly banter that night since a) her previous relationship was really none of my business b) I thought trying to ask someone out in such a state would be kinda gross and manipulative and c) I didn’t really know if I was interested in her romantically at the time of this interaction, so our conversations continued onward. 

One night a few weeks later I ended up drunk texting her (was a bad mistake), and to my surprise, I guess I charmed her quite a bit as she ended up convincing me to pursue my own interests, talked about the idea of moving to a big city together, and ended the conversation saying how much she appreciated me (sorta based on how we used to interact when we were younger, I kinda took that as a ‘I like you a lot’ but that historical context is really hard to explain over text to a bunch of internet strangers).

That was two-ish weeks ago, and since then I decided that I really needed to take these interactions far more seriously (while also trying to step away from social media a bit to focus on school), and eventually gave her my number which neither of us ended up using to contact each other over (something, something, didn’t work on her end, something something, I’m funnier on social media).

In spite of that development, I decided to bite the bullet and ask this girl out to see each other, saying I’d pick up the tab of wherever we ended up (specifically I asked if she wanted to go get coffee or drinks from one of the places she likes (she told me about the place during the drunk text thing)). She read the message, but ended up ghosting me afterwards. I didn’t try reaching back out again since I don’t like the idea of being annoying/clingy, but I think at this point the silence kinda tells me everything I should know about the potential relationship. This was like five days ago.

I guess I’m sharing this story for three reasons 1) personal closure 2) looking for advice on how to move on 3) to see how other people might react to this situation. Was I reading too much into our interactions? I know there’s always going to be a bias when retelling these sorts of things, but I really thought that our relationship was developing in a more romantic direction. Maybe I took too long to do anything about it, maybe I was misreading our interactions, or maybe I just need to stop thinking about this and move on entirely. 

I feel really bad and kind of embarrassed about the whole situation since I think I may have fucked up our friendship we had beforehand, and I don’t know if I should even try salvaging it at this point, but unfortunately it’s hard to just ‘drop it an move on’ I guess due to our shared history and the fact she reentered my life at a point when I really needed connection with another human being.

Am I the only one that feels like there is more to life than working a 9 to 5 job, getting married, buying a house and all that standard life? Like you were meant for more? 

I have been feeling like this a lot. I am already 25, I finished university with a degree in computer science, I have worked in corporate for 3 years which burned out the life out of me, currently unemployed. After the first 3 months I realized that the corporate life is not for me, I was not meant to be stuck there, in the cubicle, my heart was screaming everyday that it wants out  and I endured for 3 years until I finally had the courage to quit. Worked at a coffee shop for a while and I liked it but my parents were judging me harshly because I was “too smart to serve coffee” 

I have really tried to give corporate life a go but every day I had the same question: :”is this it? I will spend my time like this for the rest of my life just to survive, maybe buy a house, get married? Is this what life is all about?” 

What I really want is to explore, to live. It’s not like I don’t want to work, it’s more like I want to work for a purpose, for a project, for something I can be passionate about. If I had enough money I would just travel in a camp van, working odd jobs, diving into every country and culture to learn about them and then move on to the next, that s my dream life. I want to see, explore and learn stuff about this world as much as I can, not spend my time in the cubicle.

Am I childish? Do I dream too big? I always thought that maybe I should return to corporate or some normal job and just live like this but it feels like giving up. Nobody in my country shares my views so it’s kinda lonely haha ",2,1761953302.0,Life,9,1.0,False

I’m in the early stages of opening a small coffee library (quiet café meets reading nook), and I’ve been thinking a lot about the guest WiFi setup.

Since people will definitely be hanging out for hours reading or working, I want the customer WiFi to feel seamless and safe..  but also separate from our internal systems (POS, security cams, etc). I came across tools that create branded login pages, set time/session limits, and even show terms of use before connecting. Some, like Beambox, also collect emails and help with basic automation, but I’m still learning what’s best.

Also curious: has anyone here tried running AI-generated content (like automated welcome emails or reviews) triggered through WiFi logins and tested it through bypass AI tools to make it feel more natural? It’s a weird intersection of tech and customer touchpoints but feels promising.

Would love to hear:

* What do you use for guest WiFi in a public-facing space?
* Any issues with freeloaders or long-term campers?
* Anyone tried tying WiFi access to follow-ups or loyalty offers?
* What tools help keep things safe and engaging?

1ol97c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1ol97c9/the_immortal_roommate_conundrum_chapter_10/,[The Immortal Roommate Conundrum] Chapter 10,"Alex's life with John, the maybe-immortal roommate who treated centuries-old artifacts like thrift-store finds, was already a circus of suspicion and denial.

By now, Alex was 99.9% certain his roommate had been alive longer than the Constitution. The evidence was overwhelming: Russian crowns worn ironically, military papers spanning three wars, tea with a guy literally named Morton Graves, and whiskey with Lucifer himself—who'd casually mentioned John pulling Excalibur from a stone and outdrinking Dionysus.

But here's the thing that made Alex want to scream into his pillow every night: **John had never actually admitted it.**

So when a sharply dressed man who screamed ""corporate overlord"" showed up to discuss Aegis Q—the shadowy supra-conglomerate that secretly ran half the world's economy—and addressed John as if he were his boss, Alex's frustration reached critical mass.

# The Suit and the Surprise Visit

It was a lazy Saturday afternoon, and Alex was sprawled on the couch, half-watching *The Office* while John casually polished his ""prop"" sword—the one Alex was now 100% convinced was actually Excalibur, used by both King Arthur and Alexander the Great, because why the hell not at this point.

The apartment smelled like Merlin's leftover cookies, which were so good they had to be enchanted. Alex had accepted that too. Normal cookies didn't taste like heaven had opened a bakery.

Then came a knock at the door—sharp, authoritative, the kind of knock that said, *I'm here on important business, and my watch costs more than your rent.*

Alex opened it to find a man who looked like he'd stepped out of a *Forbes* photoshoot. His suit was impeccably tailored, charcoal gray with subtle pinstripes that probably cost more than Alex's car. His watch gleamed—something Swiss and obscenely expensive. His briefcase was monogrammed with a subtle but unmistakable ""A.Q.""

Alex's gut churned. He'd seen that logo before, whispered about in financial forums and conspiracy subreddits. Aegis Q. The puppet master behind global markets, the shadow conglomerate that owned everything from tech giants to pharmaceutical empires to half the Fortune 500.

""John Harrow, please,"" the man said, his voice smooth and professional, like a lawyer who'd never lost a case.

Alex, suspicious but too curious to say no, let him in. ""Uh, yeah, he's... polishing a sword. Come on in.""

The man strode past, nodding politely, then spotted John sitting on the couch with Excalibur across his lap, a cleaning rag in one hand and a beer in the other. If the man found this odd, he didn't show it.

""Mr. Harrow,"" he said, setting his briefcase on the kitchen table with the reverence of someone handling a nuclear launch code. ""We need to discuss Q3 projections and the Singapore merger.""

Alex's jaw hit the floor. *Mr. Harrow?* Q3 projections? *Singapore merger?*

John, still holding Excalibur, grinned. ""Hey, Richard. Take a seat. Want coffee?""

*Richard?* Alex hovered by the counter, pretending to scroll on his phone while his brain screamed at maximum volume.

# The Aegis Q Revelation

The man—Richard, apparently—opened his briefcase, pulling out sleek folders stamped with the Aegis Q logo. Alex knew that name. Aegis Q wasn't just a company; it was a myth in financial circles. Headquartered nowhere, owned by no one, yet its CEO was a ghost—no photos, no interviews, just a name whispered in boardrooms: *J. Harrow.*

Now, watching John flip through financial reports like he was reading a grocery list, Alex felt his reality tilt sideways.

Richard launched into a spiel about ""fiscal quarters"" and ""market consolidation"" with the ease of someone who'd given this presentation a hundred times.

""The board's concerned about the quantum computing division,"" he said, sliding a tablet toward John. ""Revenue's up 40%, but they're worried about overextension. And the Tokyo office needs your sign-off on the neural interface project—Stage 3 trials are ready, but the ethics committee wants final approval from you personally.""

John nodded, scrolling through the tablet with one hand while sipping his beer with the other. ""Tell Tokyo to slow down on human trials. Bump R&D funding by 10%—we're close on the fusion reactor prototype, and I want that prioritized. Also, move the Mars drone project to Phase 2. NASA's dragging their feet, so we'll just do it ourselves.""

*Fusion reactor?* Alex nearly choked. *Mars drones?* His coffee mug slipped, clattering onto the counter, but neither John nor Richard looked up.

Then Richard dropped the real bomb.

""Mr. Harrow, with all due respect, the board's asking again why you insist on living in..."" He glanced around at the peeling wallpaper, the thrift-store couch, and the pizza box currently doubling as Excalibur's stand. ""...this residence. As Aegis Q's CEO, you could have a penthouse in Dubai, a compound in Monaco—""

""CEO?!"" Alex's voice cracked like a teenager hitting puberty. Both John and Richard turned to him, and Alex realized he'd said that out loud.

John's grin was infuriatingly calm. ""Oh, right. Alex, this is Richard, he handles the boring Aegis Q stuff. Richard, this is Alex, my roommate. He's a data analyst—loves spreadsheets.""

Richard offered a polite nod. ""A pleasure. Mr. Harrow speaks highly of you.""

""CEO?"" Alex repeated, his voice barely a whisper now. ""You're the CEO of Aegis Q? The company that owns... everything?""

John shrugged, setting Excalibur aside with the casual ease of someone who'd probably used it to conquer half of Asia. ""It's just a side hustle, man. Keeps me busy. Richard does most of the heavy lifting—board meetings, shareholder calls, all that corporate stuff. I just make the big decisions and sign things.""

""SIDE HUSTLE?!"" Alex's voice hit a frequency that could summon bats. ""Aegis Q is a TRILLION-DOLLAR CONGLOMERATE! You own quantum computers and MARS DRONES and FUSION REACTORS!""

Richard, ever professional, interjected. ""Actually, we're valued closer to 2.3 trillion, but Mr. Harrow prefers to keep our exact holdings private.""

Alex grabbed the counter to keep from fainting. John—his roommate, who made tacos and hummed sea shanties—was worth **2.3 trillion dollars** and ran a shadowy empire that made Elon Musk look like a lemonade stand entrepreneur.

""Why?"" Alex managed, his voice hoarse. ""Why are you living in this dump?""

John's smile softened, just a fraction. ""Keeps me grounded, man. Palaces and penthouses are boring. This place has soul. Plus, you're good company."" He turned back to Richard. ""Tell the board I'll stay here. They can keep their quarterly bonuses.""

Richard sighed, the kind of sigh that said he'd had this conversation before and lost every time. ""Very well, sir. I'll relay your decision."" He packed his briefcase, stood, and adjusted his tie. ""Shall I schedule the next review for November, or would you prefer December?""

""November's fine. Bring the Mars projections—I want to see what NASA's stalling on."" John walked Richard to the door, shaking his hand like they'd just discussed a fantasy football league instead of world domination.

The door clicked shut, and Alex stood frozen in the kitchen, his coffee forgotten, his brain attempting a hard reboot.

John strolled back, grabbed Excalibur, and plopped onto the couch like nothing had happened. ""You good, man? You look pale.""

# Alex's Billionaire-Induced Meltdown

""Good?"" Alex's laugh was unhinged. ""GOOD? You're the CEO of Aegis Q! You're richer than entire COUNTRIES, and you're living in an apartment with a leaky faucet and a couch that smells like regret!""

John shrugged, wiping down Excalibur with a dish towel. ""Money's just a tool, Alex. I like it here. Good vibes, good company. Besides, Richard handles the boring stuff—I just point the ship in the right direction.""

Then he opened the fridge, pulled out ingredients for tacos, and said, ""Want tacos? I'm thinking carnitas tonight.""

Alex wanted to flip the table. He wanted to grab John by his flannel collar and shake him until the truth fell out. He slumped onto the couch, and opened his laptop. He had a spreadsheet to update.

**Sheet: ""Evidence of Immortality""**  
 New entry: *CEO of Aegis Q, 2.3 trillion net worth, owns islands, fusion reactors, Mars projects. Still deflects with tacos.*

**Sheet: ""Deflections/Excuses""**  
 New entry: *""It's just a side hustle."" (Chapter 10)*

**Sheet: ""Food Bribes""**  
 New entry: *Carnitas tacos (pending).*

# The Immortal Oligarch's Charade

The next morning, John acted like nothing had happened. He made coffee—some artisanal Ethiopian blend that probably cost more per ounce than Alex's rent—and hummed what Alex now recognized as a Babylonian work song.

John grinned, sliding a perfect stack of pancakes onto a plate. ""Want syrup?""

Alex took the plate—because the pancakes were, as always, divine.

The rent was still cheap. Merlin's cookies were still in the fridge. And John was still the most infuriating, enigmatic, deflection-champion billionaire immortal roommate in the history of Brooklyn.

Alex wasn't moving out. Not yet. But if the next visitor was Jeff Bezos calling John ""sensei,"" he was grabbing Excalibur, the ruby, and maybe one of those islands John was offloading.

Or at least asking for stock options.

By: Will Of Ashes

Socializing while recovering from trauma, is like going through a series of lights while driving. You go through every green light and stop at the red one. We are so worn out from the long journey that we stop and settle. We make our home in intersections full of neon red. We walk away bruised and bleeding, because when the lights turn green we aren't ready to move forward. The fire that we walk away from keeps burning hotter and hotter, until it burns away what is left of us. I'm so sick of seeing everything melt away. I don't usually mix alcohol with bonfires, but my friends wanted to go out tonight. And honestly, I think sitting in this room of memories is going to melt me into nothing. ""It will help to get out of the house."" My friends keep telling me. Even though I doubt anyone who uses ""Help"" and ""Alcohol"" in the same paragraph, I am too tired to give it that much thought. As I was getting ready to leave, I looked in the mirror and saw the chipped glass and blood reflecting the torment of my mind. I still hear her crazed yelling in my ears. The scars from the glass, sang sweet sermons straight into my being. I usually didn't wear long sleeve shirts, but I didn't want to garner unnecessary attention. The only one I had I didn't wear much, because it gently held the last piece of my childhood within its fibers. Tonight seemed like a night I could use some material comfort. 
As I walked out the door to my friend's car, my buddy Randal was leaning against the car, smoking on one of his home rolled joints. He saw me and immediately commented on the broken window on the second floor. ""Really walking on glass when she was around, weren't ya?"" He was never really great at reading the room, but luckily our other buddy Jax reached over and smacked him upside the head. Randal let out a loud ""Ow!"" and it gave me a chuckle. ""You should feel bad for that joke.""  Jax said in an almost parental tone. ""You guys are like dumb and dumber."" I said as I hopped in the backseat. Jax and Randal hopped in the front seats, and we headed to the local bar. ""Wouldn't we be the three stooges? I mean, you are here with us."" Randal said as he passed the joint back so I could take a puff. I inhaled deeply, and felt my current reality release with the smoke. Riding on the white clouds and lingering in the air, being bounced around by the soft bass in Jax's music. ""Alright. But you are definitely Moe."" I said as I passed the joint back. ""It's because I give you Moe weed in your joints."" both Jax and I rolled our eyes and in unison responded ""More like ""Moe headaches."" "" 
After a short car ride of banter, we pulled up to the local bar. A little rundown tavern by the name of ""Fire And Whine''. We walked in and I immediately felt something weird. A feeling of unease creeped up my spine, and seized my eardrums. ""Yo Myre! What's going on?"" Jax's voice echoed in my ears, temporarily freeing me from the feeling of unease. ""I can't quite explain it."" I said shakily as I sat down at the bar. Before I could speak again, a woman walked over and asked if she could sit next to me. ""Feel free!"" I said as I gestured at the seat. She sat down and her perfume danced its way into my nose. Echoing a familiar,  comforting smell. The smell of sandalwood. It was the smell that would fill my childhood home, whenever my mother lit a candle or incense. My only solace in a house full of blood and needles. Before I could find a non creepy way to ask about her perfume, she started introducing herself. ""My name's Lily, btw! What's yours?"" she asked cheerfully ""My name's Myre. Nice to meet you. "" I responded meekly. ""If you don't mind my asking, is your perfume sandalwood?"" Lily looked at me shocked. ""You have an incredibly keen nose. Funny enough it's actually not perfume."" I was fully prepared to be blasted for being ""creepy"" so her excited response threw me for a loop. ""Oh?"" I slowly responded. Not really knowing how else to respond. ""Yep! I make scented candles for a living. So different smells tend to cling to me, even if I change after."" The smell continued to drift off of her, playing with the weed in my brain and releasing the tension that was wrapped around my spine. ""Sandalwood candles are my favorite. I would love to learn how to make them, if you are ever down to teach me?"" I said as the beer Jax ordered for me manifested in front of me. She was actually ecstatic about me wanting to learn more about her craft. We continued talking for a few hours, cheerfully washing away my depression with good conversation. 
Before the night came to a close, Randal came over and pulled me aside. His usual calm cheerful composure was shattered into anxious eyes and lower lip biting. ""Be weary of her, man!"" he said shakily, while his eyes frantically glanced at her and back at me. When I inquired why I was incredibly disappointed in his response. ""There's a rumor about her. It says she is the reason for all the disappearances recently! I live across the street from her, and no man has ever left after going in."" My eyes were rolling back into my skull because this all sounded incredibly juvenile. ""You really are basing this on a rumor? Come on, man! If you and Jax believed every rumor about me, we would have never been friends."" Randal conceded that I was right, but still tried to dissuade me from continuing my conversation . ""There's a reason her eyes are like black holes!"" He said, as a last ditch effort. ""Really?! How desperate are you? We are in a dark bar. My eyes probably look like black holes, right now!"" I angrily whispered as to not alarm Lily of this absurdity. Before Randal could respond, Lily walked up behind me and all color drained from his face. ""I'm about to head out, I live within walking distance if you want to hang and chat more?"" I explained to her that I wasn't looking for anything more than friends. ""Still dealing with a lot of scars from my last relationship."" I said, tightly gripping my right arm. She shook her hands and explained that she was only looking for friends as well. ""I just went through a pretty heated breakup myself, so I am in the same boat."" She invited Jax and Randal, but they both declined. ""I'm going to spend the night with Randal, and drive home in ther murning."" Jax said, slurring his words. Randal was drained of color and simply nodded in agreement. We all went our separate ways for the night, and I walked with Lily back to her house. 
Upon reaching her doorstep, the house seemed rather peaceful actually. Beautiful flowers grew along the step, even in the dead of night they made her lawn feel vibrant and ethereal. Leaves and roots stretched down from hanging planters on the porch. As if they were touching down to greet you. We entered the house and I was bombarded with a million different smells. Almost all of them were pleasant, except for one that eerily lingered in the background.   Like someone dumped sewage in the back of a perfume shop. I put it in the back of my head for now, but my friend’s words made it impossible to fully dismiss. We took off our shoes and set them in the entryway. We walked in and amongst her extremely bright interior, I got a good look at her face. What I initially thought was an exaggeration in poor taste, seemed to be very real. Her pupils were completely black. No brown, no green, nothing! Just two giant black dots in a space of white. She noticed my sudden shock and mentioned how it was an extremely rare birth defect. ""People always thought I was some monster, because my skin was pale and my eyes were void of color."" Upon her mentioning it I now noticed how blinding her skin was. A very strange thing considering how much foliage layered the exterior of the house. When I gave my condolences for experiencing that she waved her hand dismissively. ""It's fine! Validation is a dead concept to me anyway. I don't need the approval of others.""
 To the right of the entryway was a small living room. The room had a tan rundown couch, a coffee table, a loveseat and a fireplace. Atop the fireplace sat 8 candles, all burned away to various degrees. Each with names carved into the jars. We sat down on the couch and I asked her about them. As she stared over at them her eyes slimmed, and It felt like the air got sucked out of my lungs. It was like the chill I felt at the bar, but more dangerous. It didn't just have my ears and my spine, it felt like I had a knife to my throat. ""Candles I made with previous relationships and family. None of them are around anymore."" She stated with a voice full of disdain.  I apologized for asking, and the air lightened up slightly. She offered me some tea, and I accepted only so it would give me time to formulate an excuse to leave. I couldn't pinpoint it, but a feeling was rising up in me. It was akin to what I felt every time my ex tried to kill me.
 As she walked in the kitchen to get the tea, I cycled through my options. Then I came to a horrifying realization. My phone was missing. I had it in my pocket when we left, but now it wasn't there. I checked the folds of the couch, and It was not there. Before I could pull my hand fully out, I heard the clink of cups being set on the table behind me. ""You dropped this."" Lily stated while reaching my phone out to me. Her voice sounded more coarse, as if she was on the tail end of a cold. I turned back and saw that she had one hand behind her back. ""You can just set the phone on the table, I don't need it right now!"" I was trying my best to play it calm, but I could hear my heart beating in both ears simultaneously. Resounding in my brain, making thinking nigh impossible. I sat up and she smiled from ear to ear, so wide you wouldn't guess she was human. Before I could hear myself think again, she had grabbed my hand, placed my phone in it and stabbed through the phone and my hand. I rolled off the couch screaming and writhing in pain. She knelt down in front of me and laughed as I tumbled around leaking blood from my hand. ""You should make sure to keep track of your belongings. Now you will never lose it again."" Now her eyes were rolled back and she was twitching with a look of utmost pleasure. ""The screams of good men always make me so hot inside. And they always make the best candles!"" she said while letting out a soft moan. 
 I stopped screaming, and tried to center my brain but it was all in vain. ""Who told you to stop screaming?!"" she said, grabbing my hair and smashing me into her coffee table. The pain was intense and I could feel my nose shatter. She pulled my head up to hers and stared into my eyes with a look I was all too used to seeing. ""Scream you worthless waste of air. Cry. Wiggle in agony. That's all you men are worth"" I smiled, the blood from my nose running down into my mouth.
 ""You can spill my blood and break my bones. But you will never see the day where you take my life."" I said trying to seem more confident then I was. It caught her off guard long enough for me to get in some damage. Using the hand with the knife stabbed through it, I backhanded her face running the tip of the blade through her eyes. She let out a loud ear-rupturing scream as blood and bits of eyeball poured from her eye sockets. Quickly solidifying on her cheeks like wax evading the flame of the candle. She let go of my head, and I mustered up the last of my energy and ran for the door. As soon as I put my good hand on the handle, my head lit ablaze. 
My hair was quickly burned away from my scalp, and my flesh was starting to melt off in chunks. All I could see was the effervescent glow of flames and burning skin. It would be mere seconds before my brain was no more. ""So much for not taking your life, huh? You can't make a good candle, without reducing a few souls to nothing."" She started laughing while holding a candle with my hair pressed into it. I could feel my life going up in smoke, and I regretted not listening to Randal. At that moment the smell of sandalwood flooded my nostrils yet again. Beckoning back to my one beacon of safety, as every mistake rolled through my mind. Remembering my childhood and the simplistic escape of a candle. Staring into its dancing flame, while my mother extinguished her flame with a needle. ""Burn away the nightmares of this world, and drown out the smell of death with your smells."" Remembering the wish I made upon that one light. I bashed my head into the wall, lighting the house ablaze. The last thing I heard was lily screaming in the background. The roaring flames burning away her seemingly beautiful facade. Strangely I finally felt at peace. The nightmare is over! I no longer have to fear women, or drown in anxiety, for I am a wax man and I have burned my worries away.

What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for—the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?” —But it’s nicer here.… So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands? —But we have to sleep sometime.… Agreed. But nature set a limit on that—as it did on eating and drinking. And you’re over the limit. You’ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you’re still below your quota. You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? When they’re really possessed by what they do, they’d rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts. Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?” – Marcus Aurelius

As much as we all need to eat and sleep, these necessities can become indulgences.

And if we take them to the extreme, they can stop us from doing what we’re meant to do — help others and work for the common good.

For example, imagine a world without good literature, or art or the sciences, or without jobs and vocations.

It would be a dull, boring world.

We were all put on this earth for something, a calling.

Oversleeping, overeating, and being idle prevent us from fulfilling our specific missions in this world.

Oversleeping steals precious time we could spend on meaningful tasks.

Overeating makes us overweight and can have damaging effects on our health, like diabetes, heart disease, and strokes.

Being idle wastes time for no good reason. It's not that our lives are short; it's that we waste a lot of them.

Marcus tells us to observe the ants and how they accomplish their individual tasks.

If ants can go about their specific tasks, then why do we find it so hard to get out of bed in the morning?

We should spring out of bed to achieve what our nature demands.

Of course, to do anything worthwhile in this world is no easy task.

But when you have a why for your life, a mission that you clearly set out to achieve, you should be able to get through any obstacle, even if that means getting out of bed in the morning. 

Jesus said, ""Man does not live by bread alone.”

We crave much more than food and sleep.

We crave meaning, serving others, and working to make people's lives easier, whether that's through information (writing) or inventions.

How I focus on the sustenance of the soul.

Work and helping others are sustenance for the soul.

Benjamin Franklin said, “to serve the common good is divine”.

And that's precisely what sustains our souls.

How I practice this advice with fasting:

1️⃣ - I get up early, drink black coffee, and water.

2️⃣ - I start going about my day with the common good in mind, I write, I read, I pray (I'm a Christian, so I pray three times per day and go to church some days). 

3️⃣ - Once I've completed my work for the day and read, etc, I then break my fast and eat a meal. I will then relax, have downtime, and spend time with friends or family.

Of course, we all love food and love to relax, but if we are gluttons for these, we neglect to work towards proper sustenance of the soul: Helping others and serving the common good.

And that's why I follow my fasting routine. Doing so helps me prioritise my tasks effectively. Which, for me, is my writing, reading, and work for the day.

I'm not saying I fast every day, but it's something I've been doing for a while. It's really helping me prioritise my most important tasks, which are writing and reading, because I want to be the best writer I can be and thus have a positive impact on others.

However, whether you choose to fast or not, the point remains simple.

Prioritise good works and deeds every day.

Our ability to serve the common good is what makes us different from animals.

Even animals eat and sleep.

However, what they lack is a mind like ours.

Therefore, they are unable to have a significant impact on the world like we do.

We are born with these extraordinary minds for a reason.

We must use them.

The bottom line: 

Although eating and sleeping are requirements, we don't experience true meaning and fulfilment from them. So make sure you place limits on them. Doing so will free up time for you to excel in your profession and serve and help others.

BUT I've lost 10 pounds since starting a cut and my strength has gone up actually which is insane. Whenever I would cut it would ALWAYS drop. ANYWAY Imma drop the secret sauce and give you guys an update post in two months when I'm super lean again:

1. Walk 10k steps  
2. Eat whatever you want except no processed food and almost no carbs. I might get hate for this BUT IT WORKS FOR ME. which means I have the right to put you guys on. try it, if it's terrible then go back to carbs :)  
3. 12-3-30 HOLY. This is the easiest way to burn off 400 calories. 12% incline, 3 speed, 30 minutes. Insane. And my heartrate and blood pressure got noticeably better in a week. 

OH ALSO, when you wake up don't eat anything for 1.5 hours and have a black coffee. This really curbs apetite so I had my first meal at 1pm cause I genuinely wasn't hungry at all. 

  
SO YEAH. I eat mostly chicken, eggs, and milk. And it does wonders for me. I bench 245 now which is my all time PR, my vascularity has gone up, I see my abs again. Things are going well. Tho this might be more realistic for the guys.
