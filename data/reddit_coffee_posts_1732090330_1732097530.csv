1gvm4on,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1gvm4on/financial_infidelity/,Financial infidelity ,"Background: My partner and I are high school sweethearts. We met first time when I was 20 and where friends for 6 months before we started to date. I went to international high school and had already studied abroad a few years, lived separately from my parents and dated several guys even had a one year relationship before meeting my partner. We come from two different continents and met in my home country. Both from middle class backgrounds. 

Due to many different reasons (childhood sexual trauma among them the other being that my father is diagnosed with borderline disorder) had a really rough time in my teenage years and applying to international Highschool was my way of ""getting out early"". 

When I met my partner I felt immediate connection and attraction. I tried to keep my hands away during 6 months as I didn't want to rush into any relationship. When we finally went on a date.. followed by years of great relationship with mutual trust. By then we start university and my brother checked my mailbox while we visited my partners family in America. And there was a bill on 1500 USD. This was at a time when I was saving everything I could and tried to keep expenses low as possible as we lived on loans. He had bought a vinyl player, vinyls and things and had a gigantic student loan just growing. My mother helped talking sense into him and he payed it off borrowing my money. I got the money back. It was not a learning experience. 

5 years later I discovered he had credit card bills at 22 000 USD. This was at a time when I was taking SSRI and seeing a therapist every week to talk about my childhood trauma. I was a mess. He promised to pay bills off that year and I supported him emotionally asking how he was doing and checking in on him for a full year until boom.. he dropped his secret card stash (those he promised to cut when we together cut his cards a year earlier). He promised to take therapy or I would leave him. We created some distance between us as he moved abroad to work earning more money and paying off the credit card loans. 

He managed to pay those off and we started to become closer again. Trust grew and we did a lot better. I felt like we could connect and talk about anything. I was completely open to him and expected the same in return. Every month we sat down and looked at our monthly expenses (we still owned the apartment together) and we shared food costs when together. I would visit a month here and there working remote. Our savings grew on my account and on his it was supposed to be around 10 000 usd in savings in addition to what he contributed to our common savings at my account. So every time we payed the bills I was expressing how proud I was that he had changed as he said he did. I also thought I looked happier. We connected better. 

Every time he lay out for groceries I asked in low voice are you sure you can take it on your card? Or should I? You don't take from the savings account right? And he said no I got it under control. Meanwhile he said he no longer needed therapy sessions. It was fine he had control. 

Until this last weekend. He is supposed to move home Dec 1 and I asked him to transfer the money to our common savings account. We have talked about it monthly and he and I have checked best way tax wise to do it. While having conversations at our common apartment I noticed he shifted from belly breath to chest breathing and he completely shifted position in the chair looking uncomfortable. So I asked what had happened and he said it's mostly gone due to tv tax etc. I was baffled and contacted my therapist. He said I should ask to see the account. The morning after he showed an empty account. 

Meaning he repeatedly lied to me at the end of every month the last 1,5 years and every time I talked to him in grocery stores (100 times over 1,5 years?) as well never asked for help or corrected me when I talked to him about how he was doing mentally and financially. 

Luckily he has not been able to take loans in our home country due to the address change. The credit card he had was prepaid only which makes me think that's why he took from the savings account. Anytime he wanted to do some sport or enjoy something he took out cash. Meanwhile I have not spent money like that at myself. He used up our yearly common budget to go and see his family in Canada. 

What would you do? 

I had therapy for codependency and I'm not. I am very interested in psychology and I know he is not a narcissist. Yes some tendencies but the guy loves children, animals and anything cute. Cries when he watches titanic. He has many good sides and is a caring person who usually wakes me up with a coffee and a kiss last 14 years together. 

We will meet with therapist tomorrow together. I need to hear others opinions / reflections.  ",1,1732096900.0,AskMenAdvice,1,1.0,False

Lately, my main account I had a nice feed of coffee reels and cars. Just a really good aesthetic.

My gaming one, was its own niche as well. Aesthetic of setups and whatnot.

Till yesterday, I logged in to send my mom a message and started checking out friends and family stories. Scrolled and the first reel crops up as someone dying of an illness.

Okay, it’s sad, they’re young. I don’t comment. Scroll. 

Next reel is a woman who lost her husband, then the next reel is someone else who lost someone close to them. For the next twenty reels it’s just a bomb of death, dying, incurable illness. 

I couldn’t help but wonder if it’s just the feed or if I did something to provoke it. I swap to my gaming account and it’s completely normal? 

I swear off my main account but then forget and today, same issue. I see on my feed a video of coffee and I click it, normal coffee video. Next video following it is again, someone is dying.. like holy moly. I feel like the algorithm is out to get me (not really) but it’s cranking out some of the worst and depressing stuff.

Winters have a way of slowing us down, urging us to pause and savor the little things. There’s a quiet beauty in just sitting and relaxing, wrapped in an old oversized sweater. Not just any sweater, but the one your grandmother knitted years ago. Despite its age, it carries a sweet, familiar scent—something you eagerly look forward to every year.

Picture yourself on a cozy rocking chair, a steaming cup of tea by your side. The aroma of home-brewed tea fills the air, comforting and nostalgic. There’s something about tea made at home—it tastes more authentic, more like home than any café could ever match.

In the background, the old radio hums “Bade Achhe Lagte Hai,” complete with the occasional static interruptions. Those crackling noises take you back to Sundays when your father would fiddle with the antenna, determined to fix it. You smile, realizing no playlist or app can recreate that same magic.

Winter evenings are meant to be slow—moments where you let go of productivity, deadlines, and the constant rush of life. There’s no “abhi kar leta hoon” urgency, just the freedom to unwind.

So, take a moment. Pause your fast-paced life. Gather in the living room with your loved ones. Play antakshari, sip on that perfect cup of tea, wear your old sweater, and immerse yourself in the vibe. Because no coffee chain, streaming app, or branded hoodie can ever feel as warm, as homely, as these simple joys.

Winters remind us: sometimes, it’s okay to just be.

My bathroom used to look like a game of Jenga gone wrong, with toiletries precariously balanced on every available surface. So I decided it was time for a bathroom storage upgrade, and opted for these bathroom shelves from QEEIG. Here's my thoughts. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Update:

**BEST PRICE on the QEEIG Bathroom Shelves here:**

[**https://amzn.to/3CLbHGM**](https://amzn.to/3CLbHGM)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

These aren't solid wood. They're MDF, which initially made me skeptical. I mean, who wants fake wood in their carefully curated farmhouse-chic bathroom? But then I remembered the time my ""real wood"" shelf warped into something like a Salvador Dali painting thanks to shower steam, and suddenly MDF didn't sound so bad.

The rustic brown finish is doing its best honest work trying to look like real wood, kind of like how I try to look like a morning person before coffee. It's not fooling anyone up close, but from a normal distance, it's surprisingly convincing. Plus, in a bathroom, do we really want to be examining things that closely? I think not.

The finish is what I'd call good enough. It gets the job done without trying to win any awards.

# My Favorite Features

**Measurements**. It's 15.7"" wide and 6.7"" deep, so they're  not too big, not too small. It's a good size for those of us living in homes where every inch counts. The depth is enough to hold your stuff without turning your bathroom into an obstacle course.

**Weight capacity.** Each shelf can hold 25 pounds, which is impressive considering I can barely hold a plank for 25 seconds. It's enough to handle my entire skincare routine along with some decorative items that make my bathroom look like a Pinterest board.

**Brackets.** The invisible bracket design does all the heavy lifting while pretending it doesn't exist. The metal brackets are actually quite sturdy. They're cleverly hidden behind the shelves, giving you that clean, floating look that makes people wonder how it stays put.

**Toilet paper basket.**There's a metal basket that can hold 4 rolls of toilet paper, which is perfect for those of us who buy in bulk because we never want to relive the Great TP Shortage of 2020.

**Installation**. It's not too difficult. They include all the hardware. 

# Pros

**Space optimization.** These shelves transform that weird empty space above your toilet into useful real estate. It's like discovering an extra room in your house, except it's vertical and specifically for bathroom stuff.

**Moisture resistance.** The MDF construction actually makes these more bathroom-friendly than solid wood. They don't warp or get wonky in humid conditions, unlike my hair.

**Aesthetic.** The rustic brown finish works with multiple décor styles, anything from farmhouse to modern to I'm trying my best with what I've got.

**Good value.** For what you're getting, the price point is pretty reasonable. 

# Cons

**The faux wood finish up close.** up close, the wood finish is about as authentic as reality TV. But unless your guests are conducting forensic examinations of your bathroom shelves, this shouldn't be a deal breaker.

**Math required.** Installation requires accurate measuring, which means you might need to do math (ugh).

# Final Thoughts

**Who should buy this?**

* Anyone who's tired of playing Tetris with toilet paper rolls
* Small space dwellers with big storage dreams
* Those who believe in the power of organization but don't want to spend a fortune
* Anyone who's ever lost something in their bathroom because there was no proper place to put it
* People who impulse-buy bath products and need somewhere to put them
* Anyone who's ever balanced something precariously on the back of their toilet

**Who should skip?**

* Solid wood purists who would rather die than use MDF
* People planning to use these for heavyweight storage
* People who enjoy the thrill of items randomly falling into their toilet

I am going to give you miracle weapon. ,"I have a lot of experiences about GS. It's been going on for more than 12 years, but I think I've been targeted since childhood, I've been screwed over all my life, that's why I've been through everything.

It's all a long story and I'm not going to write about it here. Thanks to the fact that I got into a catastrophic, disabling health condition (perhaps also as a result of them), I learned something.

  
I have experience with different forms of stalking, mostly they used slander, intimidation and effort of humiliation. However, there were also suspicious deaths in the family, purposeful family break-ups, assaults and even paranormal experiences. The scale and number of people who seem to be involved and know about it is totally abnormal.

I can't explain this phenomenon but not all beings that are involved must have a human nature. It doesn't matter who they are, who's in it and why so few know the surface. Their essence is EVIL. Although in this you are like a real truman show, but where is your life at stake. There is no middle ground. In fact, this applies to all HUMANS. The world is in the process of strong changes and something is happening in the background against the good people. You are chosen because you are a threat to evil. But there is HELP for you.

They don't want you to know what I'm going to write next.

Trust me. In its deepest essence, it is a spiritual war of good against evil. No one can purposefully manipulate your life unless you are weak. Your magic weapon is taking care of your temple. In your temple resides a divine spirit that is connected to God and desires your spiritual and physical development terribly.

In order to strengthen and develop your spiritual abilities, you must have information on how to restore your body. Some are scientific information techniques and others are healing and lifestyle techniques. In fact, you have to become perfect. This is what you must strive to achieve, even if perfect as God is perfect, even in the image of God.

It's a tough road even without this evil... but the result is that you won't be so easily traumatized by any of their actions afterwards. You must rebuild your body and you will also change your consciousness by using the following techniques. THIS IS HOW YOU WIN:

 \- Live in total celibacy, mainly with your mind and of course with your body.

\- Practice dry fasting and combine these two things with prayer.

\- Do daily coffee enemas.

\- Use Near infrared rays with classic infrared 250 watt lamps every day.

\- Learn the right meditation - it consists in the flow of energy downwards - not in the head!

\- Don't eat a lot of sweets, don't eat pastries, don't eat a lot of fruit, but nourish yourself with cooked food - vegetables and never be a vegetarian, but don't eat a lot of pork.

\- Study toxicology to avoid toxic metals, there are many pitfalls. You may have them in your mouth... Learn not to need medical care. Know specific foods that provide special nutrients, such as iodine (kelp) zinc (red meat, especially steaks) and cooked vegetables and sardines.



The list starts from the most important (first 5). It is not possible to write everything. You need to understand the scientific aspects of diet and you should learn how to work with energy. Start from you. Reassess the options, but always stand by your right decision, don't let yourself be impregnated by totally inappropriate attitudes towards life. They will always try to get you out of the way if you improve. NEVER GIVE UP. Always stand and move on. Spread the truth but be careful.

They will try to control your life, even choose your wife. Real women will try to sabotage. If your bloodline is RH negative, look for the same woman. Teach all these things to your children. That's what they don't want you to have strong offspring.

One more time. Never give up, those who don't give up don't lose. Seek the truth and spread it. Don't be afraid of them. God is the one who controls the world. You will be one hand with God if you becoming more perfect. Don't be afraid of death.

Winters have a way of slowing us down, urging us to pause and savor the little things. There’s a quiet beauty in just sitting and relaxing, wrapped in an old oversized sweater. Not just any sweater, but the one your grandmother knitted years ago. Despite its age, it carries a sweet, familiar scent—something you eagerly look forward to every year.

Picture yourself on a cozy rocking chair, a steaming cup of tea by your side. The aroma of home-brewed tea fills the air, comforting and nostalgic. There’s something about tea made at home—it tastes more authentic, more like home than any café could ever match.

In the background, the old radio hums “Bade Achhe Lagte Hai,” complete with the occasional static interruptions. Those crackling noises take you back to Sundays when your father would fiddle with the antenna, determined to fix it. You smile, realizing no playlist or app can recreate that same magic.

Winter evenings are meant to be slow—moments where you let go of productivity, deadlines, and the constant rush of life. There’s no “abhi kar leta hoon” urgency, just the freedom to unwind.

So, take a moment. Pause your fast-paced life. Gather in the living room with your loved ones. Play antakshari, sip on that perfect cup of tea, wear your old sweater, and immerse yourself in the vibe. Because no coffee chain, streaming app, or branded hoodie can ever feel as warm, as homely, as these simple joys.

Winters remind us: sometimes, it’s okay to just be.

1gvln74,https://i.redd.it/z3bvpnidy02e1.jpeg,"Part 4 of 9 Mindfulness Revisited: Advanced Practices for Inner Peace and Well-being ""Mindful Observation"" • [Click to Expand]","## Mindful Observation

Let’s explore the practice of Mindful Observation together. This is a beautiful way to deepen your awareness of the world around you, engaging fully with your environment. I’ll guide you through each step to help you experience this practice in a meaningful way.

### 1. **Prepare Yourself**
   Start by finding a quiet space where you can focus without interruptions. This could be indoors or outdoors—wherever you feel comfortable. Take a moment to settle into your environment, allowing yourself to become fully present.

### 2. **Take a Few Deep Breaths**
   Close your eyes and take a few slow, deep breaths. Inhale deeply, feeling the air fill your lungs, and exhale slowly, letting go of any tension. As you breathe, allow yourself to transition from the busyness of your mind into the stillness of the present moment.

### 3. **Open Your Eyes and Choose an Object to Observe**
   Gently open your eyes and choose an object in your environment to focus on. It could be something simple, like a leaf, a piece of fabric, or even the view outside your window. The key is to select something that you can observe closely and with curiosity.

### 4. **Engage Your Visual Sense**
   Begin by focusing on the visual details of your chosen object. Notice its colors, shapes, and textures. Observe how the light interacts with it—are there shadows or reflections? Pay attention to every detail, no matter how small. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to what you’re seeing, without judgment.

### 5. **Expand to Other Senses**
   Now, bring in your other senses. If you’re observing something you can touch, notice the texture—whether it’s rough, smooth, soft, or hard. If it’s a natural object like a flower, gently smell it and notice its fragrance. If you’re listening to the environment around you, focus on the layers of sound, the subtle and the obvious. What do you hear? How do these sounds make you feel?

### 6. **Notice Your Emotional Response**
   As you continue to observe, take note of any emotional responses or thoughts that arise. Does the object evoke a sense of calm, curiosity, or perhaps nostalgia? Whatever you feel, simply observe it without judgment. This is part of the mindful observation process.

### 7. **Explore with Curiosity**
   Allow yourself to approach this observation with a sense of curiosity, as if you’re seeing this object or environment for the very first time. What new details do you notice? How does focusing on these details change your perception of the object or your environment?

### 8. **Stay Present and Connected**
   Remind yourself to stay present. It’s natural for the mind to drift to other thoughts, but each time it does, gently guide it back to the object or environment you’re observing. The goal is not to achieve perfection but to practice presence.

### 9. **Reflect on the Experience**
   After spending a few minutes in mindful observation, take a moment to reflect. How did it feel to observe so closely? What did you notice that you might normally overlook? How has this practice affected your awareness of your surroundings?

### 10. **Carry the Awareness with You**
   As you conclude your mindful observation, take a deep breath and bring your awareness back to the broader environment. Notice how your body feels, how your mind feels. Carry this heightened sense of awareness with you as you move on with your day, allowing it to enrich your experiences.

### 11. **Practice Regularly**
   The more you practice mindful observation, the more naturally it will come to you. Try incorporating it into your daily routine—perhaps during a walk, while drinking your morning coffee, or even while sitting at your desk. Each time, allow yourself to fully engage with the world around you, enriching your daily life with presence and mindfulness.

By practicing Mindful Observation, you’re training yourself to break free from ""autopilot"" and engage more fully with your surroundings. This practice helps to cultivate a richer, more vibrant experience of life, making even the simplest moments more meaningful.

It's been an interest of mine for 10 years but I had to drop it about 5 years ago due to personal life things and just never picked it back up.

My requirements for a roleplay part are as follows:
-18+ as I am 21
-Preferably no straight cis men because I've just not had good experiences with them.
-Patient and willing to work with me and help me out if I'm doing something wrong. I know I have issues with not knowing when to end paragraphs or when to use certain punctuation as well as a problem with run on sentences so beware of that(I'm aware of and trying to fix all of this.)
-NSFW is not required but if the story leads to that I'm cool with it.
-Never control my character. I don't like when people control what my character does or says without checking with me first.

Actual Roleplay Related Stuff-
- I typically do MxM/FxF/NBxNB/NBxF type stuff if we're doing OCxOC. I might occasionally want MxF.
- All roleplays I do will be romance based at the very least.
- I play your love interest you play mine.
-I want to RP on discord.

We can roleplay in private messages or we can make a server just for us to use if we decide to do multiple RPs together.

I don't think I forgot anything but if I remember something I meant to say here then I'll bring it up in when we talk.



Here is the plot I'd like to use! ↓

Ever since you were little you knew that you wanted to be a famous musician one day and that it was only a matter of time before you made your dreams happen. 

You held down odd jobs in highschool but never for long because you knew it's not what you wanted to do with your life. When you graduated your parents convinced you to go to college and offered to pay for it as long as they saw that you were trying,which you did at first.

 You got a job at a local radio station which scratched your itch for musical stimulation for a while. You spent your first year conversing with the callers about whatever music was popular and sometimes getting to play your favorites when the locals weren't calling in any requests. You even started dating a barista at a cafe that was on the same block as the radio station! You really felt content in life for a bit.

As you eased into your second year though you felt that musical itch come back, stronger than ever this time. You didn't just want to play the same pop songs and listen to the same people call in their opinions day in and day out, you wanted to be a rock and roll star. 

You slowly worked towards putting together a tape and sending it out to a bunch of record labels and by the beginning of your third year  in college you got a call back from one willing to take a chance. The only problem was that it was one of the few you applied to that would require you to move across the country from your family and partner. Which is exactly why you decided not to tell anyone until the day you packed everything up and dropped out. 

On the day you left you hugged your family good bye and had a very tearful goodbye turned break up with your partner. You decided to end things when you felt like they didn't support what they called ""Your irrational, spur of the moment decision"". They had screamed about the life you had planned together and how you couldn't just leave out of nowhere to pursue some wacky dream. That didn't matter, all that mattered was your chance to rock, which actually went really well. 

You sold out stadiums and arenas in the years to come afterwards and became quite the star. After about 10 years that life took a toll on you though and you decided since you had made the mark(and the money) you wanted to make that your next tour would be your last. On the way to your last tour stop you noticed that your next tour location was your hometown! You hadn't visited since you left due to your parents moving closer to you about two years after you moved. 

On your first morning there you decided to visit your old work place as well as the coffee shop you remembered frequenting so much when you were younger. You remembered that place had really good banana bread. You noticed when you and your crew went to order though that the owner was different now than it was then but still familiar somehow? They also didn't seem very fond of you, which was very odd for you to experience. Didn't they know who you were? Most people would kill to have any interaction with you at all. You made it your mission to figure out what their problem was before you left in 3 weeks to head back home.",1,1732094166.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

1gvlh9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gvlh9h/my_mil_said_she_never_liked_me_and_now_i_dont/,My MIL said she never liked me and now I don’t want to host thanksgiving ,"My partner and I have dated for a few years, lived together for two.  When I first met his mom I was very nervous and wanted her to like me.  I learned some customs that show respect and did them.  I cooked meals from scratch for her that she loved.  Holidays were hosted in our home, I would cook for days and serve the whole family, making sure every detail was perfect.  Holidays were lovely, I never had times like that with my own family and was grateful to the point of tearing up many times (not in front of my partners family).  My partner and I have a business that takes up much of our time and hadn’t seen his mother much lately, so I planned a day to pick her up, take her to a local coffee shop she enjoys, and to lunch.  As soon as she saw me she immediately commented that I had lost weight and complimented me multiple times, then asking to take selfies with me so she could post them on Facebook because I looked so pretty.  I have had issues with eating disorders in the past so the comments did make me feel weird.  But I knew she was trying to compliment me so I didn’t say anything.  We went to lunch and she wanted to take more selfies and was again complimenting my looks.  She said “You were ok before but too overweight.” I don’t know why this hurt me but it did.  I blinked back tears, and the food came.  I couldn’t eat it, and found myself pushing food around and only taking some bites of dry salad.  My partner and mom ate, either not noticing that I wasn’t really eating or not commenting on it.  I did not want to cause a scene because again, I knew she was trying to say something nice but she is very blunt.  She is not aware that I used to starve myself, she probably wouldn’t have said it if she did.  After lunch, she needed to go to the restroom so I helped her (she’s in her 80s and uses a cane but needs to be steadied).  While she was washing her hands she told me “You know, I never liked you but you’re ok now.”  

That did it.  I couldn’t hide the hurt anymore.  I teared up and stammered awkwardly that her son would be right back to help her walk to the table.  I went to the table and quietly told my partner I would take an Uber home, that I was upset about something his mom said but I would see him at home.  His mom tried to call me but I decided not to answer.  

I guess the reason I’m feeling so upset is that I’m feeling like I’m only worth something if I’m thinner.  I also thought she always liked me.  She acted like she did.  Now it all feels fake.  I don’t want to host thanksgiving anymore.  Why should I kill myself cooking for days for someone who only really liked me when I lost a few pounds? My partner thinks I’m overreacting and I misunderstood her.  He said it’s normal for MILs to not like DILs at first because we “take away their sons”.  But I didn’t take him away.  He is the one who hasn’t made an effort to spend much time with her.  Every time we have seen her is because I organized it. 

But she’s old, she’s a blunt Asian mom, and she doesn’t know I had eating disorders.  So am I the asshole for wanting to cancel thanksgiving?  Should I just forgive her and suck it up so the family has a nice thanksgiving together?  Am I being a huge baby?

1gvlgy0,https://i.redd.it/4fwqa1fxv02e1.png,"Failed second time , this time on speed ","When driving on a downhill road with a speed limit of 50 km/h and speed bumps (both long and short) spaced 500 m to 1 km apart, should we aim to maintain a speed of 40–44 km/h between the bumps? I felt that was a bit too fast, especially as it was raining. I think I could have slowed down more.

While driving, I felt like I was ""spilling coffee"" on every speed bump. I slowed to 30–32 km/h for the bumps but then had to accelerate again. I was trying to reach the speed limit to avoid getting marked down for progress, but I ended up focusing too much on speed.

Now, reflecting on it, I realize I need to find that balance between maintaining progress and driving safely. For example, I could have driven at 35 km/h between the bumps and slowed to 20–25 km/h for the bumps without accelerating too hard afterward.

I was unsure whether we should always try to reach the speed limit, even in situations like this with speed bumps and downhill sections. Looking back, I think maintaining 30–35 km/h between the bumps without pushing too hard to reach the speed limit would have been better.

Other cases where test felt , I was not looking left while turning right may be she missed me while looking left.
I went above speed limit in one case
Parked on double yellow line before reversing ( felt like I should have used my brain more instead of stopping when tester said to stop)


Other questions can tester marked for one mistake in two different category like , before traffic light a t junction there was congestion I was aware of that but suddenly due to low visibility I thought there was some keep clear box and I should stop before that.and braked but suddenly and released it , after  realizing that there is gap after keep clear and I could stop near traffic light( felt like I got marked for that under traffic controls and reaction to hazard) or may be speed bumps also accounted for reaction to hazard with traffic conditions.

1gvlg3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkersComp/comments/1gvlg3w/ime_lisfranc/,IME Lisfranc ,"Last year I fell down the stairs at work while 6 weeks pregnant. I sprained both ankles and broke my right foot, resulting in a lisfranc injury. I was taken by stretcher to the ambulance off of the stairs to the hospital where it was determined through paperwork that I had broken the first and second metatarsals in my right foot, pretty high up. The deformity was pretty extensive and the bruising extreme. I was then recommended to a orthopedic and upon arrival deemed in need of emergency surgery. However, due to being 6 weeks pregnant my surgery was put off until the second trimester to ensure viability. I was instructed off my feet for the entirety of almost a month during that time. I was then brought in for a fusion almost a month after my initial sustained injury. Following that surgery (end of Jan) was in a cast and boot until the end of March, again off my feet the entire time. I was then out of the boot and allowed to start PT in April, where I feel I did make slight progress in terms of mobility (not nearly enough) but not pain. I was then too far along in my pregnancy and instructed to stop PT however did discuss with my DRs PA about returning to work until my baby was due. I was released by her without consult from my surgeon with restrictions and off I went. Well two days in I ended up being ina lot of pain. My work could tell and HR even stated that if I was in pain they didn’t want me there like that. I went back to the Drs, saw my actual surgeon and she wrote me back out until a month after my baby was born. For the last month or so I was pretty much sitting around, occasionally at the beach to swim and try to relieve some of my pain and relax until my baby came. I was tailed one time at the very end of my pregnancy and they followed me to McDonalds where I got a Diet Coke and a burger and then sat by the water in the town over. I actually ended up calling the cops because I didn’t know who was following me! They fled the police but once they were able to catch up to them they said it was comp. 
Since having my baby I’ve put on a lot of weight. This is exacerbating my pain - i believe. I am doing everything in my power to get the weight off including medication with my primary care physician. I’m down 20 lbs since have my baby. Everything I do is still a struggle, however I have to force myself to do these things especially since my partner has had to go back to work. Unfortunately I’m a new mom and my life doesn’t just stop because of this injury. I’ve had to do the grocery shopping and stroller pushing and car seat carrying and I’ve left the house a handful of times with baby to get out and socialize (go to a coffee shop with a friend, walk to and from the car with breaks in between, go to lunch or dinner a handful of times this entire time). I do worry that this could have affect on my case but it is what it is. I’m not lifting anything heavy and I’m not exercising or going for walks (like I would die to do with my baby). My surgery was very successful however there is a slight screw out of 14 that may be causing all of this pain so my dr has written me out of work until the year anniversary of my surgery to determine if we want to remove the hardware. I’ve also been put back into PT and they’ve determined my ligaments are super loose and could cause rein-jury if not worked on and that I have gait issues and a decent limp. Unfortunately all was fine in terms of comp until now and they’re sending me to my first IME with a big wig surgeon that specializes in athletes injury for the type of injury I have. I’m not worried because I’m lying about my pain, I’m worried because I’m not and that he’s not going to take me seriously because I’m a new mom and because I work in a mostly sedentary job (sitting also hurts as I have pain in my hip from my limp, and my foot goes numb if I sit too long). Overall I’m just trying to figure out what to expect. I did retain counsel at this time because I’m at a loss in terms of what they expect from me. My surgeon thinks I need another surgery, so why would they push this on me. I really think in need to continue with rest when I can and PT and I’m afraid this dr is going to just write me off as another loser collecting comp.Thanks for any advice or insight on what to expect here on out!

Pregnancy is often portrayed as a time of glowing excitement and anticipation. But what happens during those long stretches when the novelty fades, and boredom takes over? It’s more common than you might think to feel restless, unmotivated, or even a little stuck during pregnancy. Let’s explore why boredom happens, how it affects you mentally and physically, and—most importantly—what you can do to bring back joy and purpose during this unique chapter of your life.

# Why Boredom Happens During Pregnancy

# 1. Lifestyle Adjustments

Pregnancy often means dialing back activities you once enjoyed. High-energy workouts, spontaneous travel, or late-night socializing may now be off the table. Adjusting to these limitations can leave you feeling at a loss for how to fill your time.

# 2. Physical Changes

As your pregnancy progresses, physical discomfort or fatigue can prevent you from participating in your usual hobbies and routines. Activities you once loved—like running, dancing, or even certain household chores—might now feel challenging or impossible.

# 3. Emotional Overload

Hormonal changes, coupled with the emotional shifts of pregnancy, can make it hard to stay engaged. You might feel excited one day and disconnected the next, leaving you in a limbo of not knowing how to use your energy.

# 4. The Long Wait

Pregnancy lasts a long time—nine months, to be exact! Once the initial excitement settles and preparations are mostly complete, the day-to-day routine can start to feel monotonous. The third trimester, in particular, can feel like a waiting game as you count down to your baby’s arrival.

# 5. Social Isolation

If you’ve stepped back from work, scaled down social engagements, or find yourself homebound due to pregnancy-related discomfort, loneliness can creep in, making boredom feel even more pronounced.

# The Emotional and Physical Impacts of Boredom

https://preview.redd.it/jd6tneifu02e1.png?width=6545&format=png&auto=webp&s=c12d2863fada1f7b014e71d40b00e8153684c0fd

Boredom isn’t just an annoyance—it can have real effects on your well-being.

# Emotional Impacts

* **Increased Anxiety:** Boredom gives your mind extra space to fixate on fears or uncertainties about the future.
* **Feelings of Guilt:** You might feel bad for not being as excited or productive as you think you “should” be during pregnancy.
* **Low Mood:** Persistent boredom can sometimes contribute to feelings of sadness or even prenatal depression.

# Physical Effects

* **Fatigue:** Without engaging activities, your energy levels can dip further, creating a cycle of lethargy.
* **Restlessness:** On the flip side, boredom can leave you feeling agitated or fidgety, making it hard to relax.
* **Sleep Disruption:** A lack of mental stimulation during the day can impact your sleep quality at night.

# Strategies to Overcome Pregnancy Boredom

The good news? There are countless ways to combat boredom and make your pregnancy more enjoyable. Here are some practical ideas tailored to different energy levels and preferences.

# 1. Rediscover Old Hobbies—or Find New Ones

Pregnancy is a perfect time to immerse yourself in creative or fulfilling activities.

* **Crafting:** Try knitting, crocheting, or DIY projects for your baby’s nursery.
* **Reading or Listening:** Dive into novels, memoirs, or even audiobooks on parenting and self-growth.
* **Learning a Skill:** Enroll in an online class to learn photography, baking, or even a new language.

# 2. Stay Physically Active

Gentle movement can help boost both your mood and your energy levels.

* **Prenatal Yoga or Pilates:** These are safe ways to stay active and reduce stress.
* **Walking:** A simple stroll around your neighborhood can work wonders for your mental and physical well-being.
* **Swimming:** Low-impact and refreshing, swimming can help alleviate pregnancy-related aches while keeping you active.

# 3. Socialize and Connect

You don’t have to navigate pregnancy boredom alone.

* **Join Prenatal Classes:** These offer both practical knowledge and a chance to connect with other expectant parents.
* **Engage Online:** Forums, apps, and social media groups dedicated to pregnancy can be great places to share experiences and find support.
* **Schedule Meet-Ups:** Even a simple coffee date with friends can break up your routine and lift your spirits.

# 4. Dive Into Baby Prep

Channel your energy into productive activities that help you feel more prepared for parenthood.

* **Organize and Declutter:** Use this time to prepare your home for the baby’s arrival.
* **Create a Birth Plan:** Research labor options and write down your preferences.
* **Plan Meals:** Cook and freeze meals for those busy postpartum weeks.

# 5. Indulge in Self-Care

Sometimes, what you really need is a little pampering.

* **Relaxation:** Treat yourself to a prenatal massage, a bubble bath, or a DIY spa day.
* **Mindfulness:** Practice meditation or deep breathing exercises to connect with your body and reduce stress.
* **Journaling:** Document your thoughts, hopes, and milestones throughout your pregnancy.

# 6. Explore Entertainment

When in doubt, a little lighthearted fun can go a long way.

* **Watch Movies or Shows:** Binge a series you’ve been meaning to watch or revisit old favorites.
* **Listen to Podcasts:** Explore podcasts about pregnancy, parenting, or unrelated topics that pique your interest.
* **Play Games:** Puzzle books, crosswords, or family-friendly video games can provide a mental boost.

# Reframing Boredom as Rest

https://preview.redd.it/u530gpjbu02e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc19a971ee0a45f46744d494c444e34c8efaf6e4

While staying engaged is important, it’s equally essential to recognize that boredom can sometimes be a signal to slow down. Pregnancy is a demanding time for your body, and rest is a vital part of the process.

# 1. Embrace the Quiet

Instead of feeling frustrated by stillness, try to view it as an opportunity for reflection. Use this time to connect with your baby by talking to them, playing music, or simply placing your hands on your belly.

# 2. Practice Gratitude

Focus on what you’re grateful for during this season of life. Whether it’s your health, your support system, or the excitement of meeting your baby, acknowledging these positives can shift your perspective.

# 3. Set Realistic Expectations

Remember, you don’t have to be productive every moment of the day. Some days are meant for rest and relaxation, and that’s okay.

# When Boredom Becomes a Concern

https://preview.redd.it/ajqepv3au02e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=225451082148bd70b47635e278f4e2c93b0f4279

While occasional boredom is normal, persistent feelings of apathy or sadness could indicate something more serious, like prenatal depression. Symptoms to watch for include:

* Lack of interest in activities you usually enjoy.
* Persistent sadness, anxiety, or irritability.
* Trouble concentrating or feeling emotionally numb.

If you’re experiencing these symptoms, talk to your healthcare provider. They can help you access the resources and support you need.

# Final Thoughts: Turning Pregnancy Boredom Into Opportunity

Pregnancy is a unique, fleeting chapter in your life—one that comes with its share of challenges and opportunities. While boredom is a common experience, it doesn’t have to define these months. By rediscovering hobbies, staying active, and connecting with others, you can transform downtime into a chance for growth and self-care.

And when all else fails? Take a nap or savor a quiet moment. After all, in a few months, you’ll likely look back on this time fondly and wish for a little bit of boredom in the whirlwind of parenthood ahead!",1,1732093250.0,PregnantandSingle,0,1.0,False

I'm thinking of pulling the trigger on the Jura E4. I wonder if it's possible to change the amount of coffee or water for just one coffee, without changing the saved settings?

In our home we would like to have default settings for common cups, but sometimes it would be nice to change the settings accordingly without spilling the beans to someone after me who doesn't know about it.

I know it's nonsense to most people, but for us it's a dealbreaker. Is it possible to do it on E4? If not what other Jura coffee machine can do that? We are aiming only for coffee machine for black coffee with hot water feature.

As a remote software developer working with clients across different time zones, power outages used to be my worst nightmare. That was until I discovered Westinghouse generators. Today, I'm sharing my comprehensive research and personal experience with these power beasts, diving deep into who makes them, how they're made, and why they might be the right choice for you.

# The Rich Legacy of Westinghouse Electric Corporation 🏭

**First Outage (3 days):**

* Powered entire home office setup
* Kept two refrigerators running
* Ran central AC intermittently
* Maintained internet connectivity
* Powered essential lighting

**Second Outage (36 hours):**

* Added a neighbor's critical medical equipment
* Maintained all previous loads
* Switched to propane when gasoline became scarce

**Third Outage (5 days):** The real test came during a five-day outage. Load management became crucial:

|Time of Day|Priority Loads|Fuel Consumption|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Morning|Coffee maker, office equipment|0.5 gal/hr|
|Afternoon|AC, refrigeration|0.8 gal/hr|
|Evening|Lighting, entertainment|0.4 gal/hr|
|Night|Essential appliances|0.3 gal/hr|

# Maintenance Experience

After a year of regular use:

* Oil changes every 50 hours (easier than expected)
* Air filter cleaning monthly
* Spark plug check every 6 months
* Zero major issues

Person : One, me 😝

8 Days. KTM -> Shyabrubesi, -> Lama Hotel -> Langtang Village -> Kyanjing (I think Gompa) -> Kyanjin Ri 
—> Thangshyap —> Lama Hotel —> KTM

Includes accomodations

Includes 3 meals a day

Includes 3 tea/coffee

Includes all permits (I think its TMI + Langtang pass)

Includes transport to Shyabrubeshi roundtrip (I think jeep)

1 Guide + 1 Porter


P/S : The quote isnt exactly clear and locked-in coz there are some small differences compared to earlier conversations. Initially he did mentioned estimated about $600 - $700. I am guessing he is expecting me to negotiate the price. I come here to get some info on the prices and how to reduce the price.

1. Maybe instead of jeep, I could take a bus ? Or a shared jeep ? My only worry is I am planning to travel during Holi festival time, not sure if the buses are running and if it would be better to go with jeep ?

2. Initially he mentioned the daily rates Guide was NPR is 3500 and porter is NPR 2500. He said tea houses could charge NPR500 per night. Then asked me if I would consider a package instead. I was thinking it’s just me (solo), feels abit ackward having one guide and one porter….wondering if it would be better getting a porter-guide who can also help carry. Anyone got experience with porter-guide ? Are they difficult to find ?

I am faced with the fact that I can't connect devices that support Wi-fi 7 (iphone 16 Pro/ iphone 16 Pro max) to Unify network, where there is a U7 Pro access point. The network consists of: 1x UDM SE, 1x USW Lite 8 Poe, 2x U6 Enterprise and 1x U7Pro.

WPA2/WPA3 mode activated. In the settings, the country is USA.

The 6 Ghz band is open, but for some reason there is a connection to it only in the lower range, 6e, but not wifi 7. I tried to manually specify the channels for the U7 Pro's access point, specifically choosing the last numbering from the available channels (197/213) - after that, none of the devices sees the 6 Ghz range at all, so I returned ""auto""))))

I tried to connect a separate new test wifi-network, where I opened only WPA 3 encryption and left only one access point (u7 pro) - it did not give any result, it even got worse - all devices began to work at 5GHz. For help or useful advice, I am ready to pay for coffee ;)

1gvl5pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gvl5pe/any_ideas_what_could_be_causing_me_sp_much_pain/,Any ideas what could be causing me sp much pain? ,"Hi I 34f, 180lbs, about 28 bmi.  I have had many abdominal issues through the years, ovarian cysts, diverticulitis,  appendix removed, kidney stones recently.  I have always been prone to infection but most of my issues really got serious in the past 5 years or so. I have been a drinker in the past, not really anymore (if so, a beer or two every month or 2) I smoke cigarettes. Aside from that I do eat fairly healthy, drink minimum gallon of water a day. I haven't drank soda since I was a child and never consume energy drinks. Not big on sweets either. 

-Ongoing Symptoms-
-Daily abdominal pain, the majority of the severe pain is more on my left side but I really feel mild pain and discomfort all over, abdomen/pelvis, back. Arm and leg pain and weakness comes and goes 
-Nausea most days, have been taking Zofran for years.
-almost constant diarrhea,  10+ times a day, all food seems to run through me quickly, not always digested when passed. Stool is typically yellow and very greasy. if constipated it is almost always a diverticulitis flare
-vomiting when pain is severe 
-exhaustion almost all of the time, no matter how much sleep I get, coffee i drink, was even on stimulant weight loss medication and still couldn't stay awake

More recent symptoms (last 5 months or so) 
-swollen lymph nodes (going on 4 months, did not go down with multiple rounds of antibiotics) in neck, groin and side* i am not 100% sure if the part on my side is lymph node or something else*
-severe back pain, left side, middle and upper back/shoulder that is mildly constant, but the severe pain tends to come in waves
-blood in urine past few weeks
-buldge/swollen area on my left side(where my arm rests when standing) at about the bottom of my ribs that is tender to the touch, pain radiates towards my back from it. seems to have gotten bigger since I first noticed it, but nothing is coming up on ct scan in that area

Top 3 symptoms that bother me most
-severe abdominal/pelvic pain
-nausea
-back pain 

Tests that have been done 
-colonoscopy/endoscopy the only thing that was found was diverticulosis is sigmoid, ascending and descending colon, they took biopsies and ruled out ibd, crohns, celiac, pylori, colon cancer 
-hida scan, seemingly normal (43%ejection) i don't know if this affects anything but I was only able to drink 1/4 of the drink and threw it up, they said that was fine
Multiple ct scans with and without contrast,  aside from the diverticulosis and diverticulitis flares, some ovarian cyst here and there, an umbilical hernia, there has not been much found. 
Aside from infection here and there, my bloodwork seems okay usually,  sometimes chloride is high, bicarbonate low, anion gap has been low occasionally,  bun/creatine has been high and low? 

Things I have tried
-gluten free diet (4months)
-vegetarian diet(5 months)
-no red meat (about 3 months)
-high fiber/low fiber
-Metamucil/miralax both make me unable to leave bathroom. Immodium even in smallest dose causes me to be constipated for a week
-no alcohol (1 year) 
-no cigarettes (6+ months)
My diverticulitis flares do not seem to be food related as my symptoms didn't change with diet and exercise. 


I have been to er so many times in severe pain I'm either throwing up or dry heaving, my pcp takes me seriously I think and she has referred me and tried her best to come up with ideas. The er usually makes me feel like they're treating my symptoms seriously,  but there have been a few drs mention how often I've been seen, assuming I'm a drug seeker(which I totally get bc of how things are) but I have never had drugs in my system that weren't prescribed and even then I've only had short prescriptions for pain medication during flares or after surgery. I have even asked for something less strong than oxycodone bc sometimes it's too much for me) 

The only medications I take often is Zofran, antibiotics when dealing with infection,  Tylenol. Ibuprofen has caused me stomach issues every time I've taken it so I avoid it. 

I did have a kidney stone a few weeks back that passed,(ct 2 weeks before did not see the stone, wasn't even sure it was one until it passed)the pain did not subside and the er diagnosed me with uretal colic, from what I understand that pain doesn't typically last long, and I've been feeling very bad for weeks now. 

I am seeing a new gi specialist soon, bc the first I saw closed their practice,  the second tried suggesting that my many confirmed diverticulitis flares may have  been misdiagnosed by multiple different drs/ at 2 different hospitals(with the tests right in front of him) , waiting to get in with a new one. I'm also about to start seeing a urologist and a new OB. My pcp said if none of them figure it out we will go from there. 

I am looking for any and all possibilities or suggestions to bring up to my dr, I truly just want to not feel so awful every day. I'm a mother and I feel like i can't enjoy activities with my child bc I always feel like crap. I swear I tell my spouse I feel like a hypochondriac because how could something be missed so many times, and my symptoms are very real and debilitating.  But what could it be? 

Sorry for the lengthy post, in comments I will post recent ct scan just in case anyone sees ANYTHING that could have been missed. Thanks in advance for reading and for any input you may have.  ",1,1732092237.0,AskDocs,4,1.0,False

Adam and Evelyn had to stop the tour once they got to the farm area as several of the people followed them around. Adam suggested they go up to the tower for some privacy, which was overheard and misunderstood by the crowd. It took Adam a few moments to catch up on the looks they got, much to Evelyn’s delight.

“This is not good. I do not need a cult following; I am nobody special.” Adam leaned against the elevator wall, and Evelyn laughed as it made its way up.

“Adam Wrangler. You are the most dense, special person in the universe. “

“Dense? Why? Because I locked all of that nonsense out. Yeah, I know they made a move about it and wrote books. And I was in the forum too, probably the most hated one there, too.”

“You are the most hated? I don’t believe you. They adore you. Hell, they all got shocked when Harald told them you had made contact. So tell me why is their beloved big brother also the most hated one? “ She looked at him, and Adam grinned.

“Well, my alt was Wukong. I got banned three times for suggesting Adam was nothing special.”

“Wait? You’re Wukong? Oh my god. Even I heard about him.”

The door opened and led her to the bar. For a moment, she forgot everything as she looked around. Outside, they could see the three military ships. The droids had captured one of the frigates, and Jork had to get up to fix the damages from the Ion blast before they could land it. The droid killed the whole crew before getting the standdown order. Now, it was just another prize the pirates had brought him. She ignored it as she looked around the room and then sat down in the bar where he took on the role of the bartender. He had to admit it looked much better now, and he found the remote and played some music. Evelyn smiled as she heard the tunes. “You remember?”

She smiled almost shyly. “ So .. you’re Wokung, man, I remember hearing them rant about him, the Biggest asshole on the forum. So disrespectful to you. Always saying they shouldn’t hype you up. That you just got lucky. So, how did you get back in then? I mean, when they banned you.”

“Marcus was the admin back then. He knew and found it funny. I got permanently banned when he left for the Furlion colony, and we lost contact.”

“Marcus Golian? You know he is married now, right? He runs a medical company. I saw him three years ago, "" she replied as he gave her a Blue Lagoon. She looked at the drink and back at him. “You remembered, "" she bit her lips as she repeated herself. Every time he met her eyes, she seemed shy. Maybe it was because they were finally alone now.

“Of course I do.” He winked, trying to lighten the situation while he poured himself a glass of whiskey and joined her. “Marcus got married? Then, what about Tom and Ginny?”

“Tom is working in the UN in law and administration. He is the secretary of their minister, and Ginny is Ginny. She found the richest man she could find and married him. They live on Alpha Centauri. And Harold, you know about it. So, all your blood-related issues are going just fine. “

“What about your Mum and dad?“ He tried to act normal, but it was hard. He wanted to kiss her again. She had, after all, kissed him, and the painkillers were still working, so the pain was gone.

“Dad’s still in the Navy, and Mom still works for the Mars Administration; they will be excited to hear you're doing well. Dad didn’t speak to me for months because of what I did. Not that I blame him. He misses you. Always telling me I let the best one go. God damnit. Why didn’t you yell at me? You should be angry at me.” She looked at him seriously, and Adam thought for a second.

“It would not help back then; you’re just too strong-willed. It won’t do anything now. I don’t want to chase you away. But it did break me. I got really frustrated, but then Harold needed a recommendation for his job interview, so I got hyper-focused on writing those for the kids. I focused more on what I had to do, and I had so much to do back then. Besides, I thought I had pushed you away. I thought that’s what you wanted, and I drowned myself in helping them get a chance of a better life. Sending those recommendations because the orphanage didn’t have enough people, and most of them didn’t care. Remember, like you, most kids were just there for a year or two. We were stuck there.”

“I was there for three years, and it was the best three years of my life; I just wish it didn’t start so horrible,” Evelyn said as she sipped her drink, looking at him.

“Yeah, I felt so sorry for you; I'm just glad they got out of that coma so quickly.” He took a sip and tilted his head slightly, ”Besides, what's fun about getting stuck in an orphanage with three thousand kids, half of them genetically freaks with fucked up mentality?”

“You guys were the best one there, hell. You guys were fun, and you. I mean, you and your gang ran that place.”

“Ran it?” Adam laughed. “We barely keep it going; most of the time, we are so stressed out, and we mostly run around trying to stop fights and care for the little ones. I lost all my childhood there.”

“You did a great job; why do you think I fell so hard for you? I was thirteen when I got there, and you were this cool fourteen-year-old who everybody came to. I was in love with you from the first moment I saw you.”

“If I recall, then the first time you saw me, I was covered in puke from the youngster who had a tummy flue and was looking for a mop.”

She nodded and grinned.

“You're sick, you know that?”

She laughed and held up her hand. “I saw a young man who cared for a whole room of sick kids because the adults were busy watching movies. I stayed there to help remember. It took us the whole night, and you stayed up the whole night to make sure they got through it. So Yeah, you were covered in puke from a bunch of kids. And I come here, and you still think more about others than yourself. “

Adam just smiled. “Are you going to run away again too?”

She got up and walked closer to him. Her breath was intoxicating. “Not if I can help it; I'm no longer a stupid seventeen-year-old girl. I know what I want now. “

Adam kissed her, and she didn’t resist; he knew what he wanted. When the kiss broke, she put her hand on his cheek. “We can’t.”

“Why not?” He tilted his head as he admired her perfect face.

“Because if we continue, then I’m going to kill you. You hurt Adam and the things I want to do… well, you are not in physical shape to do. “She looked at him with a mischievous grin. ”I need you in perfect shape.”

When he woke up the next morning, the bed felt empty. She had gone to her ship, and he had turned in early when the painkillers had started fading. When he sat up, he felt the pain again, and he forced himself to get up. He could not stay in bed forever. He got himself ready and walked down to the kitchen, where he found James going over the pad while nursing a cup of coffee.

“You’re an early riser too?” Adam got himself a cup and made some breakfast.

“Uh? Oh yes, sir. I still can't understand this. I mean, guys did everything correctly, and they did everything wrong. I mean. They got the ship from the Kart syndicate, which Roks told me is just a cover for the Mugga mega-corporation. Then the idiots don’t even spend time to get to know the ships. They just grab the ships and come straight here, trying to learn everything on the way. I mean, these are successful pirates.”

Adam smirked. “You forget we killed their leader. It was vengeance and rage. They probably thought we would buckle. I mean, how would you prepare for an attack on a defenseless colony that isn’t even finished building? “

“Better than this, but I get your point. But why the hell would this Mega Corp give them such a ship? That’s is one impressive ship.”

“Probably to send a message, I refused them and threatened to sue them. Business can be a deadly thing here. You have to understand. They see me as a threat that I am trying to change their views about slavery by out-competing them with my Mudskin droids.” He sipped his coffee. “Which is ridiculous; I don’t have the resources for that. I would need a whole planet filled with factories or a mega corp backing me to do that”

“Or a military force,” James replied. “You are just so damn lucky we arrived. Major Garrison insisted we came as fast as possible. She was quite nervous about coming here. But don’t tell her I said it.”

“Nervous her?” Adam smiled, and another marine came in and grabbed a cup of tea.

“Yeah, drove us crazy. I mean, she is one tough nail; she got two battle promotions, yet she was suddenly acting like a shy schoolgirl when she told us we were going here. Checking our progress and yelling at our engineers that we were going too slow.” James continued as the other marine sat down and nodded to Adam before asking.

“Talking about the Major?” James nodded, and the marine chuckled as he turned to Adam.

""Who are you? You melted the Icequeen from the other side of the galaxy.” The marine asked sincerely.

Adam almost spitted out the coffee. “What? That’s her nickname?” He laughed.” She is anything but an ice queen.”

“Oh, she is a true ice queen; come on, she is 26 years old and a major. She is constantly fighting to prove her rank, "" the marine said, and Adam thought about it. Being a major at such a young age didn't make sense. He knew that she would get into the officer academy with her father, but Major at 26?

“How did she get that rank?” He asked.

The marine looked at James, who replied. “Two major reasons. In the battle of Turga, the ship she served under lost the bridge and got boarded. No officers besides her, and she took command, defeated the invaders, and then counter-boarded. She detonated our ship and escaped in the new one. We got access to the Maina tech, and they got nothing. That got her a commission. Then, one year later, she successfully secured an evacuation of a civilian colony during a bug attack during the last year of the war Xeno-bug war. She had to plan and execute the whole thing on the spot. Running defense and evacuation. Some VIPs were involved, so when it was over, she got the title. She has been on the front line since. This is our first mission, which is not combat-oriented, well was supposed to be anyway. “

“Wait? Are you all battle-hardened marines? Shit. And she dragged you guys here?”

The marine grinned. “ We finally got a break. I thought that Roks was talking about taking the ship and returning it by blowing up the base from which the pirates came. It’s a pirate hive, and I want to see what he is planning. It sounds fun.”

“Fuck me, and no, he is not. The last thing I need is him going to blow up a syndicate to get revenge for a death that didn’t happen.”

“Aww come on. I want to see what that guy can do. I mean, he is really a beast. When he boarded the ship, it felt like we were following a sergeant with a hundred years of experience, and he told us he was a wing commander, a pilot. You have to let him loose. We need the .. ehh Intel on how his people fight.” The marine said, and James laughed.

“Don’t listen to Cain; he just wants to fight. But he does have a tiny point. He is a very good commander, and we need more information about this region of space.”

Adam sipped his coffee and thought about it. “He is a Tufons, he and the Harans are the best warrior species in this region. “ Tufons and Harans. The werewolf and the blue catpeople? And you got a few I noticed.”

“Well, now I do. And they take honor pretty seriously here, so I guess… “ He thought about it. Fuck, Roks will take the ship; he should just allow it with some military observers. Might give him some goodwill with the military.

“Okay. I have an idea. It’s a crazy one.” Adam stopped and looked around the room. Nobody objected. Not even Vorts. He had called the meeting and had the colony leaders there among Evelyn and some of her officers. So, since nobody objected, he continued.

“Roks, you will get a crew ready, you got a week, and you use their ship to return the favor; the humans get the frigate to follow and observe. We don’t need humans to attack a corporation; they can assist if they want to. “ He looked at Evelyn, who smirked.

“Still trying to play diplomat? Let me guess, no uniforms? “

”No, full uniform. Out here, the megacorps are their own government, but the syndicate is a criminal organization; officially, they are not connected. So, it’s more about sending a message. I just don’t think you want human military tech to be observed in such a battle just yet.” Then he looked at Roks, “And if they have more of those ships we can take, then take them. Log it, too; we will tell the federation we took it as compensation for their attack on us. I'm pretty sure we can make it legal. I will have to talk to Min-na.”

Roks grinned. “How many ships do you want?”

“As many as you can muster. I want a defense force and, if possible, a few gifts for the human military so they can study the tech.” Adam replied, and he could see Evelyn’s officers getting excited.

“One week, and I will have that place gift-wrapped for you. What about the captain? You better give him to me or kill him yourself because the people want to tear him apart. “

“What are you planning?” He asked

“Dropping him off where his dad is. Seems suitable. And he attacked you.”

“Yeah, but we captured him. Human law. We build a prison and put him there. If we hand him over to the authorities, they will only sell him into slavery.”

“Prison? Damn, you’re worse than me.” Roks said with a grin, and the humans looked confused.

“Prison is the worst fate here. They prefer getting sold into slavery instead. “ He explained before he readdressed Roks.” Anyway. One week to prep, then Roks leads the raid. Speak to him if you want to join.” He looked at Jork. “Or want to tweak the ships.”

Jork and Roks both grinned at the thought.

“Are you going too?” Evelyn said, and Adam shook his head.

“Naw, I’m not so much of a warrior. Besides, I have to run this planet.”

Evelyn turned to Doc. “You will be in charge of the mission from our side, intel and defense only. I will stay with the ship and a skeleton crew just in case we need to defend it.”

The officers exchanged glances and simply nodded. They all knew the real reason she stayed.

Also - is this tracky on our wine glasses? We originally wanted to get a bunch of assorted mugs and do a coffee bar with a sign ""to have and to hold"" but it will be a hot day, (probably) and I know people won't drink the coffee so it's kind of a waste. We won't be doing take-home gifts other than this, so if it sucks it sucks lol. ",2,1732091552.0,DIYweddings,2,0.75,False

All my bottom teeth wiggle and are extremely nauseatingly painful, like it makes me feel I will pass out. They also were polished or sanded down to be flat instead of tooth shaped along the frontside so it looks sort of like shitty tilework. This doesn't work well for eating, drinking, or getting food off my teeth. It also looks so horrible I think I will never smile again. 

Yes I have a Hawley for the bottom but wearing it causes immediate and horrible pain and freezing up of my jaw, neck, throat, arms. Yes my Ortho knows and I have been consistently begging for help with the worsening of my issues which have been caused by orthodontics.

Debonding the top next Monday. I'm worried my roots are gone, I'm not sure what to do and my Ortho is really awful.

One of my front top teeth has started turning grey. My top teeth are all loose, too. I really hope everything will be OK when they are removed and they will return to where they used to be, and my issues will resolve.

I do not want to maintain the arrangement that braces brought me to because now my occlusion is non-existent, I have developed crippling TMJ on both sides as well as weakness down the arms into the hands on both sides to the point I can't keep a grip on a coffee cup, upper back and chest weakness, and a neck so tight nothing can touch it. 

I'm waiting for a call back from the Ortho. It's at a dental school and boy they have ruined my life.

What should I do? Will my roots be OK if I just let my teeth float back to where they belong? Will my teeth really go back to how they were? I deeply regret my choice to get braces and it keeps getting worse. My teeth were perfectly fine and I have so so so many regrets. Please advise me. Thankyou.",1,1732091475.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Hi, 

I’m 34M from Britain (England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 


If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect.

Got the first setup of Bambino Plus + Baratza Encore esp. I guess this is my ""hello world"" to r/espresso post. Anyone looking to get this setting, it's a good time to do so in the UK as the black Friday offers start to kick in. 
What's ridiculous is sage sells this combo for 200£ more than what you can get it for separately (with discounts).",20,1732091222.0,espresso,1,0.96,False

I went back to a wfpb diet 2 weeks ago and from the first day I had trouble sleeping.
I am a 37 year old woman. Bmi 24.8

Usually, I sleep from 11pm to 8am. 
For the past week, I have been sleeping from 1am to 7am.
I don't feel tired but not in great shape either.

Here is my diet for the last two days, knowing that I do not eat breakfast in the morning.
Lunch 1: coleslow without sauce / mixed potato soup / fried zucchini
Evening 1: sweet potato stew, onion, leeks, garlic, tomatoes.
Lunch 2: wholemeal pasta with mushrooms
Evening 2: stew of red beans, carrots, onion, garlic, tomato, chili pepper.

I drink coffee but I stop at 3pm and it has never affected me. 

Has anyone else encountered this before?
