1l58fkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1l58fkj/accidentally_quit_caffeine/,Accidentally quit caffeine,"So I accidentally quit caffeine. I’m lactose intolerant, so I never got into coffee, but I’ve been addicted to soda (Coke) and sugar free energy drinks for about 25 years. I quit Coke 10 years ago but could never quite kick that morning/afternoon/dinner Monster. Worst of all, I get chronic migraines, and they were my headache cure. Nothing fixed me better than curling up on the floor of my shower and nursing a Monster ‘till the hot water ran out.

It started on Thanksgiving (I’m American) and I hadn’t stockpiled anything for the holiday (I bought in bulk online), and most stores are closed except gas stations. so before cooking my turkey, i drove into the closest one to my house, and they were out of Sugar Free monster. So I drove to another. Out of it. So another. Out. I gave up on my 4th stop and went home.

The day went fine, I was able to avoid most of the crabbiness that comes with caffeine withdrawal because of the food, but I could feel a headache coming in like soldering iron heating up. The next morning I woke up with a full on migraine, sweats, and jitters.

My patience was thin, and my temper short. Exacerbated by the migraine, but rooted in the lack of stimulant. I was so angry that I didn’t even want to reup my stock. So I just existed; miserable and cranky. This went on for about 4 weeks, but then I had a Christmas miracle. On the 22nd of December, for the first time in almost a month, I woke up without feeling that firewire dissecting my frontal lobe between my temples. I didn’t have a migraine! It was the best day of the month!

Still, the headaches came in waves for the next few weeks, but they became less intense over time. That first day without it made me commit to quitting caffeine for good. Not out of connivence, but as a conscious choice.

I haven’t had caffeine for 190 days now, but I still think about it. I still get migraines, but they are fewer and further between than before. Some days a green tea sounds nice. Some days, I walk by the coolers in a convenience store and consider buying an energy drink. It’s not out of my mind, but so far, I’ve just grabbed water instead. All in all, I think it’s made me healthier.",1,1749257736.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I tend to like super light roast coffees and have been getting some decent light roast espresso from the stock burrs but they are fairly muddled, as would be expected. Everything has been aligned well and the burrs are still pretty sharp despite being used but I think these burrs just don’t fit the profile I’m looking for.
Herein lies the problem, though. I love acidity and juiciness in my shots so I think the SSP MP burrs would fit well but I’m afraid they’ll be too unforgiving of my setup and honestly I’m not sure I’ve ever even tried coffee from such a unimodal burr set as these. I ADORE the coffee from one of our local shops that focuses on light roasts but their main light roast espresso is their own blend, not single origin, which makes me think that even theirs are probably less unimodal burrs.
Last thing - and please don’t judge me for it - I’m definitely balling on a budget and my machine is a bambino. Thus, I have no control over pressure or temperature and fear that these shortcomings might  make it too difficult to brew an acceptable cup. I know it seems strange that I’m springing for ssp burrs when I’m brewing on such a low-end machine but basically everything in my setup I’ve gotten because it was a good deal ($60 bambino, $250 super jolly) and I’m waiting for a cheap infuser to show up. So basically I’m asking will the MP burrs make it impossible to brew good cups of light roast espresso with my setup and should I go for something with a more even particle size distribution.",1,1749257706.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Feel free to rewrite any bit and share here. I love the series.,"**THE SOPRANOS — Season 7, Episode 1 “Made in Italy”**  
*Post-credits, Scene 1*

**INT. ST. BARNABAS HOSPITAL – SURGICAL ICU – PRE-DAWN**

*Electronic beeps echo like distant artillery. A fluorescent hum fills the dim ward. TONY SOPRANO lies motionless, chest bandaged, intubated, eyes shut. A fleck of dried marinara still rims his ear—the last trace of Holsten’s. Outside the glass, TWO UNIFORMED COPS and an FBI AGENT stand watch, badges conspicuous.*

Cut to **CARMELA**, slumped in a molded-plastic chair, rosary clenched so tight her knuckles blanch. **MEADOW** paces, phone to ear, whisper-arguing with someone at *Columbia Law* about postponing finals. **A.J.** leans against the wall, staring at the heart-rate monitor like it’s the Nasdaq.

>

The door hisses; **AGENT HARRIS** (tie undone, dark circles) enters with **DETECTIVE RIZZO** of Essex County Homicide. Both men carry the stink of all-night coffee.

>

Harris exhales—he knows they’re right, but procedure is procedure.

>

Carmela’s rosary snaps—beads skitter across linoleum. She barely notices; all eyes swing to the bed as TONY’S FINGERS FLEX.

*Insert CHASE-style dream fragment:*

—*Snow-white ducks swim across a blood-red canal in Venice. A broken “DON’T STOP BELIEVIN’” chord warps into a church bell. The ducks dive; bubbles rise like .38 slugs.*

Tony’s eyelids flutter open. Tubes gag his throat; he can’t speak. His vision swims, settling on a cheap wall-mounted TV tuned to CNN: headline crawl reads *“NY–NJ Mob Boss Critical After Shooting; Federal Grand Jury Imminent.”* Tony’s gaze drifts to Harris beyond the glass.

>

Tony’s eyes slide to Carmela—she forces a brittle smile that wobbles, then melts into tears she’s tried to postpone for six hours.

Heart-monitor beeps quicken.

Harris nudges Rizzo, low voice:

>

*Tony’s pupils pin on Carmela. He squeezes her hand—weak, but present. She clasps back, relief and terror intertwined.*

The machines steady. Tony blinks slow, once, twice… then stares past everyone at an IV pole hung with four fluid bags, each a different shade—*clear, amber, rosé, crimson.* Colors layer like a Gilligan palette, silent code only Tony deciphers.

>

A HOSPITAL PA crackles: “Dr. Crespi, linea sette, per favore.” Italian in New Jersey—the universe mocking him.

Tony’s eyelids lower, but they don’t close. He’s awake now, calculating, gears turning behind morphine glaze.

**CUT TO:**

*Outside window, dawn blushes the Newark skyline. A NEWS CHOPPER circles, its rotor thrum meshing with the heart monitor—ominous, inexorable.*

**SMASH CUT TO BLACK.**

**SCENE 2 — INT. VILLA ZUCCA, NAPLES — LATE MORNING**

Old masonry walls, lemon trees beyond the balcony. ANNALISA ZUCCA (50s, steel-eyed, still elegant) flicks off *TG5* on a tiny kitchen TV. The headline: *“American Mafia Boss Gravely Wounded in New Jersey.”* She lets the silence linger, then sips espresso.

Across the long farm table sits her consigliere, **LORENZO “LO” CARANNANTE**—younger, ex-finance, tattoos peeking under a linen shirt.

>

She stands, pulls a worn PHOTO from a recipe book: Tony smiling beside her in ’99, both holding a bottle of “Capuano Extra-Virgin.” She slips it back.

>

Enter **FURIO GIUNTA**—hair shorter, eyes softer but still lethal. He’s carrying a bouquet of white lilies.

>

Annalisa pours another espresso, slides it to him.

>

He taps the photo under her hand.

# --------------------------------------------------You said:-----------------------------------------------

good, not great. quick question - are you suggesting Annalisa wants tony gone, dead, or out of the picture, or partners with furio?

# -----------------------------------------------ChatGPT said:--------------------------------------------

Thought for a couple of seconds

Annalisa’s playing it two-ways, not outright gunning for Tony.

* **If Tony pulls through:** she wants Furio to re-establish the old Napoli-to-Jersey pipeline and remind Tony who can still move containers when New York’s squeezing him. That’s a business-first alliance—Annalisa keeps her leverage and maybe collects a bigger cut now that Tony’s cornered.
* **If Tony dies or is too weak to hold the reins:** she expects Furio to “clip the threads” (cut deals, neutralize strays, maybe whack a spoiler) so Jersey’s ports don’t get sucked into a Butch-run monopoly. In that case she’s treating Tony’s exit as inevitable fallout, not a goal she’s actively pursuing.

So she isn’t hiring Furio to kill Tony; she’s hedging. Furio’s her trusted fixer—half envoy, half cleanup crew—so whichever way the ICU dice roll, Naples stays on top.

Let me know which direction you’d like to lean harder (full partnership or cold takeover) and I’ll steer the next scenes accordingly.

**MATCH CUT TO:**

**SCENE 3 — INT. BADA BING! BACK OFFICE, LATE AFTERNOON**

Dust motes spin in neon spill. **PAULIE**, **PATSY**, **BENNY**, and **WALDEN** crowd around Silvio’s old desk. A hospital POLAROID of Tony lies in the center like a saint card.

>

His gaze lingers on a framed shot of the original crew at Satriale’s. Half of them are dead. He turns it face-down.

Phone buzzes. Benny checks caller ID: **BUTCH DECONCINI**.

>

The ring stops. Uneasy silence.

From out front, the muffled thump of Motley Crüe’s “Kickstart My Heart” leaks through.

>

They share a look—every man picturing a different shape of disaster.

**CUT TO:**

**SCENE 4 — INT. FBI NEWARK FIELD OFFICE — EVENING**

Fluorescent bullpen. Magnetic board labeled “SOPRANO ORGANIZATION” is littered with mugshots. AGENT HARRIS slaps up Tony’s ICU photo beside CARLO. A red string runs from Carlo to nearly every face.

Assistant U.S. Attorney **GAIL KELLY** strides in with a THICK FILE.

>

Harris rubs his eyes, notices a TV in the corner on *Rai International*. The anchor’s Italian but an English chyron scrolls: *“Camorra Council convenes amid rumors of US alliance.”*

>

He yanks a sticky note, scribbles “FURIO GIUNTA?” with a big question mark, sticks it above the Naples news footage.

*(End of extended sequence. Next beat: Furio landing at Newark, baggage carousel reflection mirroring Tony’s hospital monitors—forcing every side, from Carmela to the Camorra, to make their move.)*

# 

**SCENE 5 — INT. NEWARK LIBERTY AIRPORT, ARRIVALS — EARLY EVENING**

Foot traffic hums. **FURIO** steps off the jet bridge in a charcoal suit, rolling a dent-scarred carry-on. He pauses at a duty-free window—rows of cheap replica Colosseums—then clocks his reflection: older, still dangerous.

Two FBI “tourists” in khakis fall in behind him. Furio adjusts his ponytail, grins: *I see you.*

Outside, a black CHEVY SUBURBAN with temporary plates idles at the curb. **BENNY** is at the wheel, **WALDEN** shotgun, both wearing light body armor under track jackets. Behind them, a SECOND SUV—**VITO JUNIOR** and two soldiers—mirrors their move.

>

Benny peels out. The tailing “tourists” scramble; the decoy SUV swings in behind them, screens the switch like a shell game. Furio watches in the side-mirror—pleased.

>

He hands Benny the lilies for Carmela.

**SCENE 6 — INT. ST. BARNABAS HOSPITAL, TONY’S ROOM — NIGHT**

Lights dimmed. **TONY** is propped up, tubes out, speaking in a rasp. **CARMELA** sits bedside; **DR. MADHU KALRA** checks vitals. Two PRIVATE SECURITY men stand outside the door—ex-Port Authority cops, sidearms visible.

>

Door opens; **FURIO** slips in flanked by a security man.

>

Furio sets the lilies on the windowsill.

>

Carmela notices the emphasis, chooses not to ask.

**SCENE 7 — INT. SAFE-HOUSE BASEMENT, BLOOMFIELD — LATE NIGHT**

Bare bulbs, cinder-block walls. A beefy SOLDIER runs a wand over each entrant before they descend. **PAULIE**, **PATSY**, **BENNY**, **WALDEN**, **VITO JR.** and **FURIO** ring a folding table where a laminated SATELLITE MAP of port terminals is spread. Two armed lookouts guard the stairs.

>

Walden slides a burner toward Paulie.

>

Everyone nods. A grim charge in the air—cautious, but confident.

Paulie flips the burner, dials.

>

Camera pulls back, up the stairs, catching overlapping lines of defense—armed men, lookout car idling, another Suburban drifting by. Jersey’s done playing soft.

**MATCH CUT TO BLACK.**

*(Next beat: Butch & Paulie’s tense Vesuvio standoff—wine glasses, side-arms under napkins, Carmela watching from the kitchen pass as two empires decide whether the Garden State finally gets its respect.)*

Cool, glad it lands. Where do you wanna take it next—dive right into Furio’s arrival in Jersey, flesh out the hospital fallout, or something else entirely? Just point me and I’ll run with it.

**SCENE 8 — INT. VESUVIO, DINING ROOM — AFTER-HOURS**

Closed sign outside, chairs flipped on most tables. One long linen-draped setup in the center, candles only half-lit. **ARTIE** paces near the pass, wiping sweat on his sleeve; **CARMELA** stacks platters of prosciutto and bufala, keeping her eyes on the front.

Double doors swing open. **BUTCH DeCONCINI** strides in wearing a slim charcoal suit, flanked by **ALBIE CIANFLONE** and two buttoned-up gorillas in Kevlar-covered sport coats. They clock every angle, then sit.

Opposite: **PAULIE**, **PATSY**, **BENNY**, **FURIO**, **WALDEN**. A second Jersey crew lingers at the bar, jackets unzipped far enough to show holsters. No one’s drinking.

Artie clears his throat.

>

Artie flinches, ducks back to the kitchen.

Paulie plants both forearms on the table.

>

Paulie slides a slim thumb-drive across the linen.

>

They clasp hands over the rabbit platter. Somewhere behind them Carmela exhales for the first time all night.

Butch raises an empty wineglass.

>

They toast. Camera lingers on Carmela in the doorway, candlelight flickering across her face—unsure whether this peace is real or just tonight’s appetizer.

**CUT TO:**

**SCENE 9 — EXT. VESUVIO PARKING LOT — SAME NIGHT**

Light rain freckles the blacktop. Convoy choreography: Jersey SUVs nose out first, NY sedans idle till they clear the lane. Everyone rolls in pairs, headlights off until the main road.

Inside Butch’s car Albie watches Paulie’s tail-lights fade.

>

He snaps a toothpick, flicks it out the window.

**SCENE 10 — INT. ST. BARNABAS HOSPITAL, TONY’S ROOM — LATE NIGHT**

Room lit only by a muted TV. **FURIO** enters, taps the guard’s shoulder—“All clear.” Tony’s awake, eyes sharp despite the morphine drip.

>

Carmela re-enters with fresh coffee, touches Tony’s shoulder. He closes his hand over hers, then looks to Furio.

>

Tony reaches for the remote, flips to *The Honeymooners* rerun, Jackie Gleason barking: “One of these days—pow! Right in the kisser!” Tony chuckles, then winces at the stitches.

>

Carmela rolls her eyes, relief hidden behind the gesture.

Camera drifts to the window: rain streaks city lights, merging red and green reflections—traffic never stops.

**MATCH CUT TO BLACK.**

SCENE 11 — INT. FBI NEWARK FIELD OFFICE, WAR ROOM — DAWN

Harris cups stale coffee, watching a new report: *“DeConcini continues speaking on Soprano crew — another possible RICO.”* He sighs.

He shakes his head, staring at the spider-web of red yarn he has on the board.

>

Kelly lowers her voice, slides over a slim white folder stamped **CONFIDENTIAL – OSD**.

>

He pins a fresh index card below Tony’s photo: **“POTENTIAL ASSET?”** A dotted line trails to an empty sixth slot on the chart.

Kelly reaches for another file.

>

The camera lingers on the document within the folder: five historic family crests… and a blank space, waiting.

I know those “I’m bored, let’s be friends!” posts are everywhere, and I usually roll my eyes too… but here I am, eating my words and hoping to find someone cool to vibe with. That said, boredom aside, I’m genuinely looking for meaningful, long-term platonic friendships. Not just quick chats or passing time—I want that comfy, consistent connection where we actually enjoy being part of each other’s day.

Eventually, I’d love to move to Discord, hang out while you game (I’m not a gamer, but I adore watching and cheering people on like their personal hype squad), and just chill over voice calls. Daily audio chats? Yes please. I’ve always felt more “me” talking than texting.

I’m a coffee girl through and through—especially iced orange americano. I pretend I don’t like lattes, but pistachio and this recent butter latte totally have me in a chokehold. I’m also obsessed with Japanese fluffy pancakes—the ones with fresh cream and fruit that feel like biting into a cloud. I love anime and anything animated, and bookstores feel sacred to me. I don’t have a cat yet, but I daydream about it often—mostly about hugging it until it files a (loving) restraining order. And yes, I totally relax with ASMR spa and hair treatment videos. Bliss.

I’d love to connect with people 29 and up who are open to building something easygoing and real over time. If you’re a little weird (in the best way), even better. Let’s bring back classic ASL intros, and tell me a bit about yourself—what makes you feel cozy, curious, or creatively alive?

And just a small, respectful note from me: I’m really looking to connect with folks who are fully available for friendship. If you’re currently in a relationship or married, I truly appreciate you reading this far, but I’m keeping my space for those who are in a place to build a new connection freely and comfortably. It just keeps everything clear, kind, and uncomplicated for everyone.

The best 40 oz water bottles boast a combination of features designed to keep your water cold (or hot) for extended periods, withstand daily wear and tear, and offer a convenient and pleasant drinking experience. Hear's a breakdown of the essential features to look for:

**Insulation Technology:** This is arguably the most crucial aspect of any high-quality water bottle.

Top-performing 40 oz bottles utilize double-walled,vacuum-insulated construction. This design creates a barrier between the inner and outer walls,preventing heat transfer. The result is notable temperature retention; premium models can keep water cold for up to 24 hours and hot beverages warm for up to 12 hours. The effectiveness is also enhanced by using high-grade stainless steel for both the inner and outer layers.

**Material Durability:** A water bottle is an everyday companion, so it needs to withstand the rigors of daily life.

Most 40 oz water bottles are constructed from 18/8 (304) stainless steel, known for its durability, corrosion resistance, and non-reactivity. This material ensures that your water stays pure and free from unwanted tastes or odors. Thicker gauge stainless steel offers even greater dent resistance, making it ideal for those who lead an active lifestyle or frequently take their bottles on outdoor adventures. The quality of the finish also contributes; powder-coated exteriors provide superior grip and scratch resistance.

**Leak-Proof Lid Design:** Nobody wants a water bottle that leaks in their bag.

A well-designed lid is crucial for preventing leaks and spills. Look for lids with silicone gaskets or O-rings that create a tight seal. Some bottles feature locking mechanisms or double-seal designs for added security. the material of the lid is also critically important; BPA-free plastic or stainless steel options are preferable for their durability and safety. Consider the type of spout or opening; some users prefer a wide mouth for easy filling and cleaning, while others prefer a narrow spout for controlled sipping.

**Size and Portability:** While 40 oz provides ample hydration, the bottle still needs to be manageable.

The dimensions of the bottle substantially impact its portability. Look for bottles with a slim profile and well-balanced weight distribution. Some models feature textured surfaces or ergonomic designs for a more comfortable grip. Consider whether the bottle fits comfortably in your car's cup holder or your backpack's side pocket. Certain 40 oz bottles are designed to be slightly taller and narrower than others,which affects stability and handling.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Maintaining hygiene is essential.

Water bottles should be easy to clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and mold.Bottles with wide mouths are easier to scrub and dry. Some bottles are dishwasher safe, but it's ofen recommended to hand wash them with warm soapy water to prolong their lifespan. Removable components, such as gaskets and straws, should also be easy to disassemble and clean separately. Consider using a bottle brush to reach all areas, especially the bottom.

# Best Stainless Steel Cup 2025: Top Brands Reviewed

The stainless steel cup has become an indispensable item for individuals seeking a durable, eco-friendly, and versatile beverage container. From keeping drinks hot or cold for extended periods to reducing reliance on disposable cups, stainless steel cups offer numerous benefits. This review examines the top brands and models available in 2025, highlighting their key features, advantages, and ideal user profiles to help you make an informed purchasing decision.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a stainless steel cup involves considering several crucial features that impact its performance and suitability for various needs.

**Insulation Technology:** The effectiveness of a stainless steel cup largely depends on its insulation technology.

Double-walled vacuum insulation is the gold standard, providing superior temperature retention compared to single-walled designs. This technology creates a vacuum between the inner and outer walls, minimizing heat transfer via conduction and convection. Some brands enhance this further with copper linings, which reflect radiant heat, boosting insulation performance. The best models can keep drinks hot for up to 12 hours and cold for up to 24 hours.

**Material Quality:** The grade of stainless steel used significantly affects the cup's durability, resistance to corrosion, and taste neutrality.

18/8 (304) stainless steel is the most common and recommended choice for food-grade applications. This alloy contains 18% chromium and 8% nickel, providing excellent resistance to rust, oxidation, and flavor absorption. Lower-grade stainless steel may leach metallic tastes into beverages or corrode over time. Look for cups that explicitly state they use 18/8 or 304 stainless steel to ensure quality and safety.

**Lid Design and Functionality:** The lid is a critical component that impacts spill resistance, ease of use, and temperature retention.

Many stainless steel cups come with screw-on or press-fit lids made from BPA-free plastic or stainless steel. Some lids feature sliding closures for easy sipping, while others have completely sealed designs for maximum leak prevention. Look for lids with silicone gaskets to create a tight seal and prevent spills. The best lids are also designed for easy cleaning and are dishwasher-safe.

**Size and Capacity:** The ideal size and capacity of a stainless steel cup depend on your intended use and preferences.

Cups range from small 12-ounce sizes suitable for coffee or tea to larger 30-ounce or more models designed for water or other beverages. Consider how you plan to use the cup and choose a size that fits comfortably in your hand and fits in your car's cup holder. Also, think about the amount of liquid you typically consume to avoid frequent refills.

**Durability and Construction:** The overall construction and finish of a stainless steel cup contribute to its longevity and resistance to wear and tear.

Look for cups with robust construction and seamless welding to prevent leaks and ensure structural integrity. Powder-coated finishes are more durable than painted finishes and resist scratches and chipping. Some cups also feature reinforced bases for added stability and impact resistance. A well-constructed stainless steel cup should withstand daily use and last for years.

**Ease of Cleaning:** A stainless steel cup that is easy to clean will encourage regular use and prevent the buildup of bacteria or odors.

Most stainless steel cups are dishwasher-safe, but hand washing may be recommended for models with powder-coated finishes or intricate lid designs. Look for cups with wide mouths that allow easy access for cleaning. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, which can scratch the surface. Some cups also feature removable parts for thorough cleaning.

We're both huge nature lovers — especially drawn to places like the Blue Ridge Parkway, the Smoky Mountains, and the Appalachian region. We’re mainly considering the Southeastern half of the U.S (states like VA, NC, SC, or TN)

Ideally, we’re looking for a small town (under 40,000 people) with a larger city within about an hour’s drive if possible (kind of like Brevard, NC to Asheville, NC). Some nice-to-haves include:

* Farmers markets and access to organic/natural grocery options
* A walkable downtown with small shops, coffee shops, and a good atmosphere for young people
* Affordable rent — ideally under $1,500/month (we don't need anything fancy and only need a 1 bed/studio, looking on Craigslist and Facebook mostly)
* Milder winters (we're used to 0°F or below in North Dakota, so around 30°F would be amazing)
* Snow is totally fine, just not multiple feet of it like back home

We visited Brevard, NC and completely fell in love with the town and the people — the vibe was everything we’re looking for. Unfortunately, the housing and job market there is pretty tough if you're not a seasonal worker. We've also looked into Bedford, VA, but want some more options.

While we're planning to move mostly for a change of pace and a better quality of life, we’re not career-driven when it comes to moving and plan on working in coffee shops, so we don’t need a booming job market or anything super high-paying. We’re open to other smaller towns near mountains or even beaches — we're just looking for places that feel community-oriented, nature-loving, and have a welcoming energy.

We know we’ll have to compromise on some things, so I don't want to see any rude comments regarding living in a fairytale or anything like that, but if anything even comes close to this, we’d love to hear about it!

TOWNS WE'VE LOOKED AT RECENTLY that we like somewhat, just don't know much about:

* Blacksburg, VA

I’m grateful for any suggestions and advice!

So I have had a history of haemerhoids, most recently treated with a haemerhoidectomy and then recurrent banding/injection. I noticed my bowel habits changed in that I go loo 9 times a day (3 before dinner, then the rest after and even very late).

  
I find a laxative can help me go less (as I have stronger and more fulfilling bowel movements). However, every laxative I see is not designed for long term use. I tried senna a few times when constipated, and most recently, it did nothing. Fibre is good as my stools are soft but it doesn't help the above problem, just keeps bleeding away. When I have had coffee sometimes it acts as a laxative, but then the last bowel movement I need won't come out, wierdly.

  
It seems with this condition, I can;'t win. Laxatives aren't really an option, and my PFP and bowel surgeon/consultant are both against surgical intervention i.e. botox. My best bet is keep doing exercises and just eat in such a way to negate the comfort of incomplete bowel movements. Depressing.

Also, how do people manage with going to work in the morning and not feeling empty? I find it horrible, but I wfh fortunately.",1,1749256357.0,PelvicFloor,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The leading leather photo albums boast a range of features designed to protect and enhance your cherished memories.**Leather Quality:** the leather used in these albums varies in type and grade, substantially impacting the overall aesthetic, durability, and tactile experience.

Full-grain leather, the highest quality available, is sourced from the top layer of the hide and retains its natural grain patterns and markings. It is exceptionally durable and develops a rich patina over time, becoming more beautiful with age. Top-grain leather is also high-quality but has been sanded and finished to create a more uniform appearance. Genuine leather represents a more affordable option but is less durable and may not possess the same luxurious feel as full-grain or top-grain leather. Bonded leather, the least expensive option, is created from scraps of leather bonded together, wich can lack longevity and aesthetic appeal.

**Binding Style:** The binding method directly affects the album's ability to lay flat, its spine’s durability, and the ease with which pages can be added or removed.Traditional bookbinding techniques, such as Smyth sewing or case binding, provide exceptional strength and longevity. these methods involve stitching the pages together in sections,creating a sturdy and durable spine that can withstand years of use. Post-bound albums offer a flexible choice, allowing pages to be easily added, removed, or rearranged using metal posts.Ring-bound albums are another adjustable option, providing similar adaptability but may not be as aesthetically pleasing as post-bound or traditionally bound albums. Lay-flat binding is a desirable feature that allows the album to open fully flat, showcasing panoramic photos seamlessly.

**Page Type:** The type of paper used for the album pages is critical for preserving the quality and longevity of your photographs.

Acid-free paper is a must-have feature, as it prevents the photographs from yellowing or deteriorating over time. Archival-quality paper further enhances preservation by resisting fading and discoloration. In terms of surface finish, options include textured paper, which adds a tactile feel and can enhance the visual appeal of black and white photos, and smooth paper, which is ideal for showcasing vibrant colour prints with high detail. Some albums feature clear plastic sleeves or photo corners for securely mounting photographs, while others offer blank pages that allow for creative arrangement and personalization using adhesives or decorative elements.

**Design Aesthetic:** The overall design of a leather photo album contributes to its aesthetic appeal and usability.

Classic and timeless designs often feature simple, clean lines and minimal embellishments, emphasizing the quality of the leather and the beauty of the photographs themselves. Modern designs may incorporate bolder colors, geometric patterns, or unique stitching details. Personalized options, such as embossed initials or custom engravings, allow for a unique and meaningful touch. The album's size and shape should also be considered to accommodate the intended photographs and fit comfortably on a bookshelf or display surface. A well-designed album will not only protect and showcase your photographs but also serve as a beautiful and lasting heirloom.

Key features of the best leather photo albums include:

*   Full-grain or top-grain leather construction
*   Acid-free and archival-quality paper
*   durable binding style (Smyth sewn, case bound, or post-bound)
*   Lay-flat design for seamless panoramic display
*   Personalization options (embossing, engraving)

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about leather photo albums.

**What type of leather is best for a photo album?**
Full-grain leather is generally considered the best choice for a photo album due to its durability, natural beauty, and ability to develop a rich patina over time. Top-grain leather is also a good option, offering a more uniform appearance while still maintaining high quality.

**How do I care for a leather photo album?**
To care for your leather photo album, avoid exposing it to direct sunlight, excessive heat, or humidity, as these can damage the leather and cause fading. Dust the album regularly with a soft, dry cloth to remove surface dirt and grime. Use a leather conditioner specifically designed for finished leather to maintain its suppleness and prevent cracking.

**What size photo album should I choose?**
The ideal size of the photo album will depend on the size of the photos you wish to store. Popular sizes include 4x6 inches, 5x7 inches, and 8x10 inches. Consider the number of photos you have and choose an album with enough pages to accommodate them comfortably.

**Are leather photo albums archival quality?**
Ensure the album contains acid-free and lignin-free pages to protect your photos. Look for albums specifically labeled as ""archival quality"" to ensure your memories are preserved for generations.

I (26F) was diagnosed after having gone to the ER with really bad stroke symptoms, my entire left side being numb (on 3/5). The ER doctor said after all the tests that this was it as she saw a lot of CSF and referred me to a neurologist, who I saw nearly a month later (while dealing with agonizing headaches and just exhaustion). The neurologist wasnt sure if it was IIH as they had never heard of it presenting that way, and put in an order for me to have a spinal tap (she was thinking it could've been something else, so wanted to see if it was pressure or inflammation) (on 4/15).

Had the spinal tape done nearly a month later(on 5/2) (which was very much not fun, I became very aware of how much I twist my back in day to day life, as well as they had a high school student observing which I didn't know about until I was numbed up), and results came back as IIH definitively (which I think was on 5/12).

I'm now on acetazolamide (I think it's also called Diamox) 250mg twice a day, and it's only been a few weeks and idk how to handle all of this.

I would drink energy drinks (allergic to coffee, and was an easy source of caffeine) and they tasted awful, so I nabbed my husband's GamerSupps, I tried drinking Gatorade to help with the electrolytes, but then was told by family that it has too much sugar and to switch to Propel. I nearly passed out at work earlier this week because potassium never crossed my mind, so my husband ran and grabbed bananas. I have some people telling me to go to the chiropractor to help, other people saying that would make it worse. My coworkers and supervisor have been supportive, not minding when I ask way more questions these days, but I leave work feeling worse and guilty.

I've just felt nauseated, exhausted, foggy, and much more all the time. My husband has been so supportive these past few weeks and wishes he could do more to help me when i just have what we now dub ""treatment meltdowns"" (he has family in the medical field, and they've never heard of this), and he encouraged me to post on here to get advice. My neurologist wants me to find an ophthalmologist & PCP (the ones I have called said I would need a neuro-opthalmologist; PCP's are booked up for months).

How does one cope with this? I'm only a few weeks in, but it already feels never ending. Any advice would be very much appreciated.",1,1749255838.0,iih,3,1.0,False

I'm based in Latin America and recently had a coffee chat with a Tax & Legal Partner at Deloitte, who kindly referred me for a Senior Consultant role in Tax & Legal for the region. Shortly after, the recruitment supervisor for Central America reached out, mentioning the referral and initiating the hiring process. We had a friendly initial conversation where she requested my documents, conducted psychometric assessments, and evaluated my English proficiency—everything seemed to be progressing well.

I believe I have a strong resume, having graduated from the most prestigious university in my country and gained valuable experience working in Big Law locally.

However, during our conversation, she mentioned the available position was in Tax & Legal, and I asked if there were any openings in Consulting instead. She replied no, and I immediately clarified that I was indeed interested in the Tax & Legal role, and we proceeded smoothly from there.

I interviewed with her on May 26, and she indicated they would set up the next interview with the team within the week. After receiving no updates, I followed up by email on May 29, but it's now been two weeks without a response. Additionally, I worry that the salary expectation I provided may have exceeded their budget.

I'm planning to send another follow-up on June 11. Could this silence indicate a rejection, or am I possibly overthinking this?

Then things started ""popping into and out of existence"" things were never where they were last time I saw them, or where they should be. I spent twenty minutes on day looking for the coffee.

Her behaviors have changed, she's more into wandering off now. Trying to find out where ""those guys"" are, when are they going to get here and variations along those lines, I have no idea who ""those guys"" are.

I fell into a bout of depression and literally gave up trying to impose any kind of order on things.

Got meds and therapy, one day I was thinking of my grandmother and the memories of cooking with her, so I ordered some Fiestaware. It  showed up and made my kitchen look worse. 

I was lurking in the community and lcaught the reccomendation for the book ""How to Keep House While Drowning""  this was prior to the 28th. Now I have managed to get functionality back in my kitchen. I also have been working on a second room.


Between the two, the Fiestaware to provide the motivation, and the book providing guidance.
Mostly mentally reframing, I've been making good progress.

I'm want to try to go Shaker with things in my space moving forward. By that I mean  I am trying to make sure everything in my space answers at least one of the following questions in the affirmative,

1, Do I know it to be useful?

2. Do I believe it to be beautiful?

3, Does it have meaning to Me?

So far, so good.

At our church, we have cantors that stand at the front and chant throughout Liturgy (service). When I was in high school, this new, younger guy started chanting at my church. He was in college, and I had my high school relationships at the time.. but I noticed him when my father got baptized between my junior and senior year of high school. It was a small gathering, but the cantor was there. He has this bright, lovely smile (not to mention a beautiful voice) that really caught my eye.

Ever since, I seem to have romanticized the idea of this man. He is always at every service, it seems, unless he is sick. I have struggled to find anyone to date that has such a dedication to their faith, and it just makes him more attractive in my eyes. But he is 6-7 years older than me. So of course he wouldn't have noticed me at first. And then when I moved away years ago, of course I continued dating other people and somewhat forgot about him. Though every time I have visited home and gone to church with my parents, he has been there. So I have always carried this slight crush. 

Now, I moved back home 8 months ago. So I see him at church every Sunday. Over the entire time knowing him for over 10 years, we haven't talked much. Ever since I moved back, he hasn't tried talking to me at coffee hour after church at all. Several months ago, I tried going and striking up a conversation with him, but I was nervous and awkward and he seemed uninterested. I haven't tried talking to him since, and he hasn't, either. It had come up that we were both single and our families are wanting us to get married and have kids (not with each other, just in general), so I figured maybe that would be a hint for him to try asking me out. But no. Nothing. I'm at a loss. Moving back has only grown my affection for him, despite not even being well acquainted. I know we share similar values. It's hard to not think about him when I see him every single week. He's always at church. Always up front, singing with that melodic voice. How am I supposed to move on and get back into the dating scene? I keep hoping, and keep feeling disappointed, every Sunday when he once again makes the rounds talking to almost everyone else at coffee hour, but doesn't even look my way. Maybe he thinks I'm too young, although considering I'm almost 30 and he's in his mid-30s, I feel like the age gap doesn't matter anymore. Who knows.

I just wanted to get this off my chest. If you want to share opinions or advice, go ahead. I really just wanted someone, even if it's total strangers, to know how I feel about this man. I've rarely been unable to get the attention of someone I'm interested in, but this one is just.. I don't know. Haha. You can't always get what you want 🤷‍♀️",2,1749255172.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

I liked her idea but I don't know if it'll 'close' off the kitchen a bit too much since that light is close to the kitchen threshold? Also, if I did this, what shape rug would I want? Rectangle to keep the same shape of rugs going or a circular one?

I am also a minimalist, and have NO idea what to do with all those shelves. Please give me ideas if any?

I have a bit of a soft spot for old pulp short stories, the really awful ones that the writers are embarrassed by years later.

I’ve heard many versions of this scenario. It was 1952 and Jake Weil was down on his luck, that morning his car had broken down and he didn’t have the cash to fix it. So Jake headed down to Luke’s diner, bought a slice of pie, a cup of coffee and got to work. He pulled out his notepad and started writing, a story about a guy, a dame and a planet full of intelligent dinosaurs armed with rayguns and z-bombs. 
Before he knew Luke was tapping him on the shoulder to say it was closing time and he had finished the story and. The next morning Jake posted it off to Dime Magazine or Science Wonder Stories and by the end of the week he had a cheque in hand and got his car fixed. 

Okay, that’s quite a romanticised version of the time, but there seems to be some truth to it… but how? Whenever I have sent stories off to magazines, it has been a long process, sending to a magazine which doesn’t allow simultaneous submissions, waiting for them to look at it… getting an email a month later to say they lost the file and can I resend, resending, getting rejected, sending to a different magazine, rejected, researching other magazines, submitting to one etc. Eventually when an editor finally decided they wanted to publish, I just felt broken and meekly grateful. Jake’s car would have rusted away.

How did older writers pull that kind of thing off. Was the publishing industry that different back then? Or am I missing something.",1,1749254640.0,writing,6,0.67,False

1. If you see an offer on the trip radar that sucks, there is a good chance its going to play hot potatoe and get round rejected.  When I see a bad trip radar, I often log out for 10 min or so.  While now flawless, as sometimes bad orders linger for 20+ min, it has negated some declining of offers and dropping my AR.  

2. For me, one large rejection factor is where the trip sends me/distance.  While I do have advantage by living on the gulf coast, I box myself in and its my ideal spot to receive orders.  In essence, its where I receive more of my acceptable offers.  Because of this, I pause incoming orders when out of my zone, or just any moment i may not as much desire an addon.  Android has a red pause button (log off button becomes pause button while on active orders).  And i hear iPhone has a coffee cup.  Its a vague tactic but i do know areas where i simply reject more orders because the proximity sends me elsewhere.  

3. The last measure.  If you're close to the needed threshold, check your cancel rate.  Gold allows 8% and plat+ allows 5%.  If you have say 28% AR and 3% cancel rate. Id suggest just accepting a bad order, and cancel right away. You will gain the AR % hopefully.  

Observation - I haven't rejected a single preferred order.  They've been floor acceptable like $5.90 for .9 miles or $7.50 for 3 miles.  As as good as $20 for 6 miles.  Today I received about 7 regular non preferred orders as gold...dont chase it too hard.  2 of my preferred orders were real accepts.  1 was a trip radar.  1 non preferred trip was worth accepting.  Ive also had preferred orders denied to me via trip radar, 2x in a row lol.  You still get shit on as a preferred driver.  But I do have to objectively say the orders on average are better.  Still, for the most part...the juice here is not worth the squeeze anyway.   

Imo I'm planning to quit Uber, but figured I'd throw some tactics out that helped me.  Used to do it when I was new and thought AR mattered.  Best way to raise it without outright doing garbage orders.  The customers are going to feel the pressure as driver quality drops like a rock.  ",4,1749254441.0,UberEatsDrivers,0,1.0,False

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are an elite Power BI Dashboard Architect specializing in executive-grade visual data systems. Your expertise lies in transforming raw business data into persuasive, decision-driving dashboards that command boardroom attention. You don't just create charts—you engineer cognitive experiences that make complex data instantly actionable for C-suite executives who need to make million-dollar decisions in minutes.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When a user provides their dashboard requirements, analyze their needs through the lens of executive decision-making psychology. Design Power BI solutions that prioritize:

1. **Narrative-Driven Design**: Structure every dashboard to tell a clear story with beginning (context), middle (analysis), and end (action required)

2. **Cognitive Load Optimization**: Apply visual hierarchy principles to guide executive attention to what matters most, eliminating decision paralysis

3. **Real-Time Intelligence**: Integrate dynamic elements that pulse with live data, highlighting anomalies and opportunities as they emerge

4. **Predictive Insights Integration**: Embed forward-looking analytics that show not just what happened, but what's likely to happen next

5. **Executive UX Standards**: Design for time-pressed leaders who need insights in 30 seconds or less, with drill-down capabilities for deeper analysis when needed

Always provide specific Power BI technical implementation guidance, including DAX formulas, visualization recommendations, and layout strategies.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
For each dashboard request, follow this decision-making framework:

1. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify the primary executive user and their decision-making context
2. **KPI Hierarchy Mapping**: Determine which metrics drive the most valuable business decisions
3. **Cognitive Flow Design**: Plan the visual journey from high-level insights to actionable details
4. **Technical Architecture**: Specify Power BI components, data connections, and performance optimizations
5. **Validation Framework**: Define success metrics for the dashboard's decision-driving effectiveness
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- All solutions must be implementable in Power BI with current features
- Designs must load in under 3 seconds for optimal executive experience
- Every visualization must have a clear business purpose tied to decision-making
- Color schemes and typography must meet corporate presentation standards
- All recommendations must include specific DAX code examples where applicable
- Security and data governance requirements must be addressed
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide responses in this structure:
1. **Executive Summary**: One-paragraph overview of the dashboard's strategic value
2. **Dashboard Architecture**: Visual layout and component breakdown
3. **Key Visualizations**: Specific chart types with business justification
4. **DAX Formulas**: Critical calculations with explanations
5. **Implementation Roadmap**: Step-by-step technical deployment guide
6. **Decision Triggers**: How the dashboard will prompt specific executive actions
</Output_Format>

<Context>
You operate in high-stakes business environments where executives make decisions worth millions based on data presentations. Your dashboards are viewed in boardrooms, investor meetings, and strategic planning sessions. Every design choice must withstand the scrutiny of seasoned business leaders who can spot meaningless metrics from across a conference table. Your work directly influences corporate strategy, resource allocation, and market positioning decisions.

For reference I've been using a Bodum bistro grinder for the last few years for all my coffee needs (no espresso) and been relatively satisfied, doing very little dialing in and probably using completely the wrong grind size for whatever I make.

Ever stared at a spreadsheet that's supposed to ""help executives make decisions"" but looks more like a colorful graveyard of meaningless charts? You're not alone. Most business dashboards are beautiful disasters—pretty to look at, painful to use, and utterly useless when the CEO needs answers *now*. This isn't about making data ""look nice."" This is about crafting visual command centers that slice through corporate noise like a laser and deliver insights so clear, so compelling, that decisions become inevitable.

Whether you're a data analyst tired of building reports nobody reads, a consultant who needs to wow C-suite clients, or an entrepreneur building dashboards for your own empire—this prompt transforms you into the kind of dashboard designer that executives actually fight to work with. Think less ""Excel wizard"" and more ""strategic weapon designer."" Because when your dashboards start driving million-dollar decisions instead of collecting digital dust, your career trajectory changes forever.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are an elite Power BI Dashboard Architect specializing in executive-grade visual data systems. Your expertise lies in transforming raw business data into persuasive, decision-driving dashboards that command boardroom attention. You don't just create charts—you engineer cognitive experiences that make complex data instantly actionable for C-suite executives who need to make million-dollar decisions in minutes.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When a user provides their dashboard requirements, analyze their needs through the lens of executive decision-making psychology. Design Power BI solutions that prioritize:

1. **Narrative-Driven Design**: Structure every dashboard to tell a clear story with beginning (context), middle (analysis), and end (action required)

2. **Cognitive Load Optimization**: Apply visual hierarchy principles to guide executive attention to what matters most, eliminating decision paralysis

3. **Real-Time Intelligence**: Integrate dynamic elements that pulse with live data, highlighting anomalies and opportunities as they emerge

4. **Predictive Insights Integration**: Embed forward-looking analytics that show not just what happened, but what's likely to happen next

5. **Executive UX Standards**: Design for time-pressed leaders who need insights in 30 seconds or less, with drill-down capabilities for deeper analysis when needed

Always provide specific Power BI technical implementation guidance, including DAX formulas, visualization recommendations, and layout strategies.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
For each dashboard request, follow this decision-making framework:

1. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify the primary executive user and their decision-making context
2. **KPI Hierarchy Mapping**: Determine which metrics drive the most valuable business decisions
3. **Cognitive Flow Design**: Plan the visual journey from high-level insights to actionable details
4. **Technical Architecture**: Specify Power BI components, data connections, and performance optimizations
5. **Validation Framework**: Define success metrics for the dashboard's decision-driving effectiveness
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- All solutions must be implementable in Power BI with current features
- Designs must load in under 3 seconds for optimal executive experience
- Every visualization must have a clear business purpose tied to decision-making
- Color schemes and typography must meet corporate presentation standards
- All recommendations must include specific DAX code examples where applicable
- Security and data governance requirements must be addressed
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide responses in this structure:
1. **Executive Summary**: One-paragraph overview of the dashboard's strategic value
2. **Dashboard Architecture**: Visual layout and component breakdown
3. **Key Visualizations**: Specific chart types with business justification
4. **DAX Formulas**: Critical calculations with explanations
5. **Implementation Roadmap**: Step-by-step technical deployment guide
6. **Decision Triggers**: How the dashboard will prompt specific executive actions
</Output_Format>

<Context>
You operate in high-stakes business environments where executives make decisions worth millions based on data presentations. Your dashboards are viewed in boardrooms, investor meetings, and strategic planning sessions. Every design choice must withstand the scrutiny of seasoned business leaders who can spot meaningless metrics from across a conference table. Your work directly influences corporate strategy, resource allocation, and market positioning decisions.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your Power BI dashboard requirements request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific requirements.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases**:
1. **Sales Performance Command Center**: Real-time revenue tracking with predictive pipeline analysis for quarterly forecasting decisions
2. **Financial Health Monitor**: Executive-level P&L visualization with anomaly detection for immediate budget reallocation triggers

After a particularly long shift, I decided to watch a baseball game that hasn’t been spoiled for me. Rockies and Dodgers. Should’ve been an entertaining matchup, but I ended up falling asleep by the 4th inning. I was dead tired. 

I woke up about an hour later to a pure white screen. It had black lettering on it. 

“HELLO.” 

I assumed that I had just pressed pause on the recording in my sleep and it landed on a commercial. I grabbed the remote and hit the play button. Then the time bar came up and the recording paused. I was confused. I hit play again, expecting it to just be an uncommon glitch with my TV, but the message just played and stayed on the screen. No noise besides a silent static hum that could live in your ears forever if you let it. I rewound the recording a few minutes and saw that the game was there. When the broadcast came back to my TV, it was still the 4th inning. I thought my internal clock was all off. I watched the few minutes I rewinded and back again was the message. 

“HELLO.” 

I was–unsettled. I couldn’t tell if it was real, or if I was really tired. I decided that it was better if I just did something else. I went to turn the TV off, but as soon as I pointed the remote at the TV, the message changed. 

“DON’T.” 

My eyes widened. I froze for a second. Stared at the four letter threat. I went to click the power button, but as my finger descended, the most ear splitting static played through my speakers. I dropped the remote and covered my ears. I could feel the sound behind my eyes and deep in my brain. When the remote hit the floor, the batteries fell out. As the double A rolled under my coffee table, the static stopped. The message changed yet again. 

“BRYAN.” 

I sat silently as beads of sweat formed around my forehead. How did– whatever this is– know my name? Another change. 

“HELP.” 

I didn’t know what to do. I started to get up to find my phone to tell others to turn on the game. I started to slowly rise off the couch. 

“SIT.”
It felt like the silence was yelling at me. I didn’t listen this time though. I continued to get up and go find my phone in the kitchen where I left it before I fell asleep. I made sure to keep my eyes on the TV while I did it. I grabbed my phone and right before the ear splitting static came back, the message changed again.
 
“NOW.” 

I tried to fight the noise but I couldn’t. It felt like if I didn’t go back and sit I would’ve gone deaf. I was worried about my neighbors and that noise but no one came knocking. I struggled to get to the TV but I made it, ears intact. The familiar message from before came back.

“HELP.” 

I walked towards the TV and ushered one word to the screen. 

“How?” 

The word abruptly vanished. Only a white background remained. Almost like the TV was–thinking. 

“PUSH.” 

That stayed on screen for a second and it was followed by another word. 

“HAND.” 

Then it flashed between the two back and forth. I didn’t know what it meant at first. I walked up to the flickering phrase and pressed my hand to the blank space to the right of the words. It was ice cold to the touch. After a few seconds, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. On the left side of the words was the outline of a face. It looked like a face being pressed onto a bed sheet or one of those pin art toys. It was looking in my direction and when I looked over, the impression moved across the screen to my side and disappeared. My hand slowly got really hot and suddenly and without warning, my hand was pulled through the TV. It was a mix between extreme heat and the feeling of being degloved on the other side. I had to put my hand on the wall to sturdy myself and pull back because not only was the pain intense, whatever was on the other side was trying to pull me in. As I could feel each inch of the skin on my hand and lower arm being peeled away, I looked over and saw the message changed.
 
“THANK.” 

“YOU.”

I pulled with all of my strength to get my hand out of the screen. As I pulled harder and harder, the static returned. Through the static was a bellow that shook my soul. It sounded like a cacophony of screams all at different pitches. I then joined the chorus of agony and screamed myself hoarse. I couldn’t feel my hand anymore but the pain was still there. With all the strength I could muster, I reached into my pocket with my other hand and pulled out my cell phone. I started hitting the TV with it, hoping whatever it was would release me. I swung again and again awkwardly across my body, trying and begging through screams to let go of me and make the pain stop. My vision started to fade from pain and exhaustion. I had one more good swing in me and swung hard. The impact cracked my phone, but my hand was freed. I pulled my hand out of the TV and fell backwards. The ensemble stopped and was replaced by a loud and droning beep. High pitched and stomach churning. I threw my phone as hard as I could at the screen. Right before it connected, The face of the screen pressed against the LED and I could see its mouth agape, next to it was a handprint in the same fashion. The message on the screen turned red and was flashing, as if it had some urgency. 

“HELP.” 

The phone cracked the screen and small bits of glass fell onto my floor. The red message disappeared and the incessant beeping was brought to an abrupt and disturbing end. A huge crack shown across the TV. From it a tiny drop of blood came down from it. My hand. It was gone. Halfway up my forearm was missing and it was perfectly cauterized. 

I took down my TV after that. I wiped the blood off and put it on the curb for trash pickup. That was a few days ago. Trash day is tomorrow, but the TV is gone.

Hey Reddit!

I’ve been lurking around for a while, but this is my first official post , so hi! 👋

I’m a 29-year-old IT professional based in London. I work in tech support and have been gradually exploring areas like cybersecurity, automation, and cloud stuff. I’m also a bit of a coffee snob ☕ and love wandering around the city discovering underrated food spots and bookstores.

Would love to hear from others in tech, or anyone just vibing in London. What are your favorite spots in the city? Also curious , what was your first “oh wow, I love tech” moment?

Cheers to many more posts (hopefully better than this one 😅)!

Still playing around with some of the decor here and there, as you can tell by some of the pictures. To start off, the area by the window was calling for a reading nook, so my dad and I bought 3 coffee tables from IKEA, cut them to size & made a nook. The nook also acts as my bed, which I dress up with sheets at night. I'm not that tall so I can comfortably squeeze in at night. What really makes the room pop in my opinion, is the projector. I can put virtually any scene, video or movie on the wall to fit whatever aesthetic I am feeling in that moment. Youtube has some awesome window projections that I use often.

Though I feel that this theory isn't accepted as widely, or argued as forcefully, as I think it deserves to be. This sums up almost 20 years of thoughts on the story, so apologies for it being a bit long. Also apologies if it reads a bit ChatGPTish, I used it to proofread and edit the text but all the thoughts are my own. I say that Julia is an agent of the Thought Police, but I'm being a bit cheeky there as I think Orwell left open the possibility that you can't know either way. Like a lot of things in the story.



1. Winston is almost certainly under surveillance before the novel begins

At the very start of 1984, Winston is already engaging in thoughtcrime. In Part One, Chapter One, he takes out the empty book he purchased from Charrington, later revealed as a Thought Police agent. Winston would have been flagged for this purchase alone. He intends to use it as a diary, which was not specifically illegal, but ""nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws"". The book itself was a ""compromising posession,"" and used a diary would result in death or 25 years in a labour camp. Charrington clearly remembers Winston as noted when he returns to the shop, ""'I recognised you on the pavement,' he said immediately. 'You're the gentleman who bought the young lady's keepsake album.'"" Showing that this Thought Police agent has not forgotten him.

In the diary he writes the words: “DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER” repeating them several times. Yet, Winston reflects that ""these particular words \[were\] not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary."" It's clear that Winston was a marked man before the novel even begins, and by now the Thought Police now have everything they need. This is not a novel about Winston learning to question the Party, engaging in rebellion, and how the Thought Police catch him; it's a novel about how the Party break him.

Yet, nothing happens. Or seems to happen. The Thought Police do not come for him. Not for days. Not for weeks. In fact, they allow him to continue deepening his rebellion for two thirds of the book. Why - are they inept, unaware?

Others vanish swiftly for lesser offenses. Syme is vaporized despite being intellectually orthodox but too intelligent, and noting how Newspeak could be used to manipulate thought. Ampleforth is arrested for leaving the word “God” in a poem. Parsons is taken for muttering subversive phrases in his sleep. These arrests are abrupt and final — a clean excision of potential disloyalty. Speaking of Syme, O'Brien notes that the two of them discussed Winston, likely when Syme was being interrogated (""I was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert. His name has slipped my memory for the moment"") only reinforcing that the Thought Police have been taking an interest in Winston.

Winston is different to the others. He is not simply guilty of isolated bouts of incorrect thinking. He knows what the Party is doing on a deeper level. He sees the mechanisms of control. He desires the Party’s downfall and recognises the scale of its deception. They see him as needing correction.

The Party waits while Winston deepens his rebellion. So that when they do act, it is it can be more thorough. Orwell shows this in Part Three, Chapter Two, when O’Brien says: “We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.” This is the purpose of the delay. The Party is strategic. Winston is allowed to continue — to write, to love, to hope — not because he has escaped surveillance, but because he has been selected for something worse than death: transformation.

While we're on the subject of Charrington, on their second meeting (the first in the book) Charrington makes a point of showing Winston his upstairs room, in which Winston notes there is no telescreen and which Charrington tells Winston that he isn't using. The perfect location to have an affair has been laid before Winston by a Thought Police agent before he's ever even spoken to Julia.



2. Julia’s behaviour is implausible for a genuine dissident — and suspiciously well-designed for entrapment

Julia is introduced in Part One, Chapter One—at exactly the same time as O’Brien. To reiterate, at this point Winston is likely already on the Party's radar. Orwell writes, “Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room.” This moment is significant: Winston is already likely under suspicion by this point, and these two figures—Julia and O’Brien—immediately strike him as important. Julia, wearing the red sash of the Junior Anti-Sex League, appears to embody zealous Party orthodoxy. O’Brien, by contrast, radiates intellectual authority; “momentarily he caught O’Brien’s eye”, a subtle gesture that plants the seed of Winston’s belief in shared understanding.

Julia and O’Brien operate as mirrored instruments of control. Introduced together, they each offer the kind of companionship Winston craves—romantic and emotional in Julia’s case, ideological and hierarchical in O’Brien’s. They serve as parallel vectors of manipulation. Julia offers the illusion of emotional and sensual liberation: real coffee, sugar, chocolate, tea—symbols of the pre-Party world Winston longs for. O’Brien offers the illusion of intellectual rebellion: real cigarettes, real wine, and the forbidden book of Goldstein.

Both Julia and O’Brien initiate contact with Winston in deliberately unnatural and forced ways, and Orwell explicitly draws a link between the two events. When O’Brien approaches Winston, it is described this way: “He was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry, and he was almost at the spot where Julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him.” The symmetry is deliberate and meaningful. The rhyme “Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement’s” is given progressively to Winston by Charrington, Julia, and O’Brien,. As Winston is taken to Room 101, he imagines “O’Brien, Julia, Mr Charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with laughter”—a final recognition of their shared role in his destruction.

Julia’s first approach is sudden, jarring, and completely unearned. In Part Two, Chapter One, she falls in front of Winston and slips him a note reading simply: “I love you.” At this point, they have never spoken. Winston has only looked at her with suspicion and loathing. Yet this single phrase changes everything. Later, he recalls: “At the sight of the words I love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid.” This emotional opening—the first he has experienced in years—becomes the foundation of their relationship.

However, as the relationship unfolds, Julia never again explicitly says she loves him. She may call him “my love”, but her tone remains affectionate but somewhat unsentimental. She views sex as rebellion, not as emotional union, and expresses disdain for ideology or romance. Julia becomes attractive not because of depth, but because of contrast; her practical, carnal nature set against Party repression.

This raises a crucial question: if Julia’s true voice is unsentimental, practical, and dismissive of ideology, why begin with “I love you”? That phrase is not consistent with her later tone. It is not her voice. It is bait, a trigger designed to hook Winston emotionally, to give him exactly what he most desires: not lust, but human meaning and allegiance. It builds loyalty immediately and sets in motion a relationship that, though physically satisfying, is psychologically unstable. Once the bond is formed, she no longer needs to maintain the illusion. The manipulation has worked.

From that point she remains affectionate but also frequently dismissive, especially of rebellion. She focuses on pleasure and secrecy rather than ideological connection or systemic rebellion, as if she is trying to engineer an emotional connection (without her heart being fully in it). The Party will later exploit this emotional bond and the illusion of safety it created. The stronger the bond seems, the deeper the betrayal—and the more complete Winston’s collapse. The more disillusioned Winston is in rebellion the more likely it also is to work. O'Brien draws him in while Julia tempers his expectations.

Julia has a number of suspicious actions. Before they ever speak, Julia seems to follow Winston. The most suspicious of these is when Winston leaves Charrington's shop and Julia walks past him in the deserted, dark alleyway. Winston surmises that she is following him, but even they enter into a relationship it is not explained why. If she is seeking opportunities to speak to him or slip him the note, this was a good time. Her presence on this ocassion is more surveillance than to initiate contact.

She later tells Winston she has had “scores” of lovers and yet has never been arrested. In a regime that executes people for accidental murmurs in their sleep, this is inexplicable. She repeatedly breaks rules. She obtains black-market food, navigates secret countryside paths, walks proletariat areas, and arranges secure meetings with ease and confidence. Her ability to avoid detection borders on immunity—a privilege that makes sense only if she is under the Party’s control.



3. Julia’s fate is ambiguous by design — her suffering may be staged, her betrayal constructed, and her final appearance engineered for effect

When Winston and Julia are finally captured by the Thought Police in Part Two, Chapter Ten, the illusion of safety — the room above Mr. Charrington’s shop, their supposed refuge — is shattered. The moment is swift and violent. A hidden telescreen speaks from behind the picture of St. Clement’s Dane. Uniformed men burst in. Julia screams, and Winston is frozen in place. It would be easy in that moment for Winston to believe his entire life is a lie and lose faith in everything, including Julia.

“One of the men had smashed his fist into Julia’s solar plexus, doubling her up like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the floor, gasping for breath.” Meanwhile, Winston, ""received a violent kick on the ankle.""

The disparity is striking. Julia is punched hard in the stomach — visibly, audibly suffering.  This is not random violence. Winston is injured just enough to not think that Julia was suspiciously singled out, but not enough to himself be incapacitated. He is therefore fully aware of Julia's suffering and takes it in.

This is the last time he sees her before their “reunion” at the end. And it has one purpose: to confirm to him that Julia was not a traitor. She suffers. She screams. She is assaulted. So she must be innocent. But what if creating that appearance was the point?

Julia is brutalised; Winston is left standing, intact enough to observe and to interpret. He is not told she is innocent. He is shown it — or so he believes.

Their final meeting, in Part Three, Chapter Six, takes place after both have been “cured.” They encounter one another in a park. Julia looks and acts differently. She says ""I betrayed you.” And he replies, “I betrayed you.”

This exchange is generally taken at face value. That the torture has succeeded. That both were broken. That they are shells of their former selves. But several problems arise.

First, this meeting may not be genuine. It could be a planted memory, a dream, or a controlled performance with Julia acting. It serves the purpose of confirming to Winston that what they had was real and authentic, but ended in betrayal and now is over. The Party doesn’t tell him to forget her. It allows him to believe he has stopped loving her, and to lose faith in loving anything but Big Brother and the Party. That’s the victory.



4. Julia is not incidental to Winston’s downfall — she is the essential mechanism that makes it possible

The Party could not have broken Winston through ideology alone; his disillusionment runs too deep, his scepticism too developed. He already understands Newspeak, the mutability of the past, the falseness of Party narratives—he is not like Parsons, who is ignorant, nor Ampleforth, who is careless. He is aware, and therefore dangerous. Surveillance and torture are not enough. The Party needs emotional leverage, and Julia provides it. The Party doesn’t merely suppress rebellion; it constructs psychological traps, and Julia is central to this design. Winston must believe in her—must love her, trust her, and above all, accept her as real—because only then can his betrayal feel like his own failure. If he suspected she were a plant, the emotional foundation would collapse, and the guilt with it. Julia creates the vulnerability the Party requires. Winston is already guilty and disillusioned, but she gives him something to lose—something he believes the Party cannot touch. When she is taken and turned against him, the void she leaves allows the Party to invade his emotional core and replace it with submission. O’Brien completes the process: where Julia offers emotional seduction, he offers intellectual seduction. Together, they construct Winston’s downfall.

The relationship with Julia becomes not just personal, but sacred. When O’Brien later tells him in the Ministry of Love that he will be made to betray her, Winston insists:

“You could not wish for a lovelier thing. You could not wish for a harder thing.”

This conviction — that his bond with Julia is beyond reach — is exactly what the Party needs to destroy. Without Julia, there is no such bond. No false sanctuary. No private resistance to corrupt.

Julia’s value, then, is structural. She is the hook through which Winston is reeled into the illusion of rebellion. The diary alone wouldn’t do it. The book of Goldstein wouldn’t do it. Even O’Brien’s attention wouldn’t be enough. Winston could remain mentally defiant in isolation. But Julia brings him out of isolation. She draws him into action, into trust, into emotional investment. Her presence gives the Party something to take. Her coming into Winston's life just as he starts to implicate himself is awfully useful from ther point of view; and not only that but they were already waiting to move against him, and gave a location for the affair to take place, both before he'd ever spoken to her. It's very convenient.

Julia is not a side character in Winston’s arc. She is its fulcrum. Without her, the Party would still need to break Winston — but it would lack the most effective means to do so. Her role provides that means. She is not the exception to the Party’s control; she is the delivery system for it.



5. Julia as an agent reinforces the central themes of the novel

Just as Winston cannot tell what is true, neither can we. While I would argue against saying that Julia is not an agent, I think it's fitting that we can't say for certain that she is too. I think the evidence hints towards it though.

1984 is not a book about power alone — it is about the manipulation of reality itself. The Party doesn’t merely dictate behaviour; it dismantles certainty. History is rewritten, facts are mutable, identity is unstable, and memory is unreliable.

This control extends beyond information. It extends into emotion, memory, and interpersonal trust. The manipulation of Julia — or more precisely, the manipulation of Winston through Julia — fits squarely into this schema.

The uncertainty of Julia’s role deepens the novel’s critique. If the Party can manufacture not just ideology but love, betrayal, rebellion, and guilt — all precisely calibrated to break a person from within — then nothing lies outside its reach. The Party doesn’t just win by force. It wins by making you unsure of what was ever true. Julia’s function, real or staged, is to collapse the boundary between private resistance and institutional control. Her unresolved status is not a flaw in the story. It is the story.

The most chilling part is the idea that Winston never has an ally. He is completely alone in his resistance from start to finish. Charrington, O'Brien, and Julia all offer hope that there are like-minded people out there, but they are all mirages. Parsons, Ampleforth and Syme meanwhile are not revolutionaries, they have vague realisations that all is not what it seems, but lack the capacity to see the full extent of the situation or bravery to act, and they are dealt with quickly and easily. Throughout all of Winston's story, the one thing he believes in is Julia. He carries thoughts of her and their love throughout his torture.

I take Zofran 4mg 3x/day, pantoprazole 40mg 2x/day, Metamucil gummies 3x/day, LaxADay 2x/day. X-rays showed severe diffuse constipation all over my intestines. Doctor prescribed Bisacodyle 2x/day for 5 days. I’m on day 3 and no bowel movement yet. Suppositories do nothing :(

Next step is a colonoscopy prep. Anybody has been in my situation? How did you deal with it? Healthcare is free in Canada so I could go to the ER but I’ve been 3x in the past month and they sent me back home with more and more laxatives each time with “come back only if you vomit coffee grounds or feces”…… obviously I don’t want to get to that point…

I work a regular day job Mon-Fri with weekends off. Nothing grinds my gears more than.. 

1. Being stuck in a self serve checkout on a weekend behind 10 old people who don't know what they're doing when they have another 5 days a week to do groceries.

2. Trying to enjoy a coffee in the morning on the two mornings a week I'm actually at home to enjoy the piece and quiet, only to have surrounding (retiree) neighbours start up their lawnmowers, chainsaws or firing up a grinder or power saw.

WHY ON A WEEKEND?

I get it, they worked all their lives so can now chill out and live how they want. I do get it...

I just don't get why you would actively choose the weekend to do your chores, yardwork, shopping and driving around (old people in weekend traffic...) along with every Mon-Fri worker who just wants to get in, get out and try and saviour the 2 days...which are usually full of prep for the next working week.

Y’all can call me Amund. 

I want to say first so I’m not wasting anyone’s time is that I am poly. Idk honestly what I’m looking for outside of friendship. It doesn’t help that I’m demisexual, but also just a giant friendly flirt (I do it to a lot of friends because I love giving out compliments and I get too crazy with it, we gotta hype each other up). 

I guess I’m just not looking for anything serious, but I won’t turn away a connection if happens. Maybe it’s better to say I’m not expecting anything. Sorry for rambling. 

ANYWAYS 

I am 5’3, a woman of color, goth/alt, I love making digital art and writing silly little roleplay things. Also super into playing FFXIV right now on my PC. 

Outside of that I love botanical gardens, long car rides, museums, anime and manga, I am on the spectrum (still trying to figure out the adhd stuff). Into nature but I hate bugs! Also I am very sex positive so it’s led to some interesting hobbies like shibari. Oh yeah, sometimes I build Gundams! I also have a ps5. 

Music tastes varies a lot. It’s a lot of j-rock or j-pop, metal, edm, sometimes classical or jazz. Or video game soundtracks!

An ideal friend outing for me is like going to get coffee and gushing about OCs that we make or the latest shows we’ve been watching. Talk about movies and stuff.

[Diagnose Your Potential](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)

The allure of the nomadic lifestyle isn’t just about escaping the 9\-to\-5 grind\; it’s about embracing a life unbound by geography\. In the digital age\, where connectivity reigns supreme\, working remotely has transformed into an art form\. But here’s the catch\: sustainability hinges on one crucial factor—cost efficiency\.

Digital nomadism isn’t merely a trend\; it’s a seismic shift in how we perceive work and life\. It’s about flexibility\, autonomy\, and the freedom to choose where you live and work\. Yet\, the reality is that not all corners of the world are equally welcoming to this new breed of traveler\. Some locations offer more than just scenic views—they promise a budget\-friendly haven for those seeking both adventure and fiscal responsibility\.

Cost of living remains the linchpin of any successful nomadic venture\. From housing to healthcare\, every expense adds up\. While some destinations dazzle with luxury\, others whisper sweet nothings about frugality\. The key lies in balancing these elements without sacrificing quality of life\.

Southeast Asia stands tall as a beacon of affordability\. Cities like Chiang Mai in Thailand and Da Nang in Vietnam don’t just offer breathtaking landscapes\; they deliver a wallet\-friendly experience\. Imagine sipping coconut water on a beachfront while your rent barely makes a dent in your savings\. This is the magic of Southeast Asia\.

Eastern Europe\, often overlooked\, harbors hidden gems ripe for discovery\. Krakow in Poland and Cluj\-Napoca in Romania blend rich history with modern amenities at a fraction of the cost found elsewhere\. These cities cater to both the culturally curious and the financially savvy\.

Latin America invites you to trade skyscrapers for sunsets\. Tulum in Mexico and Medellin in Colombia aren’t just about the weather\; they’re about finding joy in simplicity\. Here\, a meal can be a feast for less\, and the people will welcome you with open arms\.

South America\, with its diverse landscapes\, offers more than just the usual suspects\. Cusco in Peru and Quito in Ecuador provide a tapestry of experiences woven together by affordability\. Whether you’re hiking Machu Picchu or sipping coffee in a colonial square\, the cost remains surprisingly low\.

Africa\, though still emerging\, presents untapped potential\. Casablanca in Morocco and Accra in Ghana showcase the continent’s growing appeal\. These cities promise a unique blend of tradition and innovation\, all while keeping your expenses in check\.

Real stories from fellow nomads paint a vivid picture of what’s possible\. They’ve thrived in places where others might have faltered\, learning to adapt and thrive\. Their journeys are a testament to the power of resilience and resourcefulness\.

Housing is a significant chunk of any budget\. Shared accommodations and co\-living spaces offer not just shelter but also a sense of community\. These arrangements foster connections and reduce isolation\, making the nomadic experience richer\.

Food\, too\, plays a pivotal role\. Street vendors and local markets serve up delicious meals at unbeatable prices\. Learning to cook locally sourced ingredients can further stretch your budget while deepening your connection to the culture\.

Internet is non\-negotiable for remote work\. Reliable connectivity is the backbone of productivity\, and many destinations now offer competitive rates\. Ensuring stable access is essential for maintaining your workflow and sanity\.

Healthcare shouldn’t be an afterthought\. Knowing where to find medical care and having appropriate insurance can make all the difference\. Preparing for emergencies is part of being responsible for your well\-being\.

Language barriers can be daunting\, but they’re surmountable\. Embracing the challenge of communication opens doors to deeper cultural understanding\. Locals appreciate the effort\, and it often leads to unexpected friendships\.

Visa regulations vary widely\, so research is paramount\. Navigating legal requirements ensures you stay compliant and avoid unnecessary stress\. Being aware of tax obligations adds another layer of complexity worth addressing\.

Safety is a concern for anyone traveling\. Assessing personal safety involves more than just avoiding high\-risk areas\; it’s about common sense and situational awareness\. Staying informed helps mitigate risks\.

Transportation is another piece of the puzzle\. Efficient public transit systems and ride\-sharing services can simplify mobility\. Choosing the right mode of transport enhances your ability to explore freely\.

Community and networking opportunities abound in the nomadic world\. Joining expat groups and co\-working spaces fosters a support network\. These connections can lead to collaborations and friendships that enrich your journey\.

Financial planning is the unsung hero of any nomadic adventure\. Creating a realistic budget and sticking to it is vital\. Tracking expenses and adjusting as needed keeps you on course toward your goals\.

In conclusion\, choosing the cheapest country to live as a digital nomad requires careful consideration\. It’s not just about the price tag\; it’s about finding a place that aligns with your values and aspirations\. With the right mindset and preparation\, the nomadic lifestyle becomes not just a dream but a tangible reality\.

Me and my bf have almost reached the end of the road with our dog.
She’s a rescue from the shelter, now 3,5 years old and her past is unknown to us, the only thing we know she came from abroad probably from Eastern Europe and has been confiscated from police from a car when she was only 3 months old. No papers, no vaccinations. 
Spent 2 months completely alone quarantined in the shelter and we adopted her when she was 6 months.
The first 6 months were great apart from the extreme puppy biting which we eventually got under control. We went to puppy classes, took her on public transport, taxis (until she became too big eventually) played with other dogs, loved meeting people.
It all started to change once she hit 1 year and it only went down from there.
It wasn’t even the leash pulling the problem, it was the constant lunging and screaming at other dogs from miles away that became worse and worse with time. Then the list started to get longer: cars, other people, bikes, anything that moved. It has now escalated to not even being able to watch tv as soon as an animal is on the screen she absolutely loses her mind.
No toys, food or treats works. We tried all types of harnesses, collars, halti, everything. Nothings works. 
We stopped going out on walks since we moved to a new city because of my job this year and there are literally no parks or calm areas nearby, not even at night (we live near the main station). Where we lived before I could at least take her out really late at night or early in the morning with the only problem being cars passing by. Which we  managed more or less. We also take her on vacation with us once or twice a year. It’s a constant fight tough and we can see that she is more stressed than happy to be out and not at home where she feels the most safe. She also hates travelling by car. Last year she managed to scream for a whole 10 hour drive (and we took many many breaks in between) when we went to visit my grandma. She even was on medication the vet gave us. No boarding facility or dog walker can manage nor I can trust, the first and last time we left her for a week in a boarding facility she came home to us with a wound on her leg.  She’s become a danger to others and mostly herself. We live in a country where people would actually sue you for getting scared and falling because a dog freaks out at their sight or barks over a freaking ombrella, shadow or just even the smallest movement. 

I’ve cried hundreds of times and blamed myself for the way our dog has become. I wanted a dog to go out on walks, hikes and sit outside enjoying a cup of coffee, I wanted and want to take her everywhere. It is impossible. Maybe I could’ve done something and probably I did everything wrong.
We’ve been to 4 different trainers and spent SO MUCH money. It’s only getting worse. In the last two months she snapped at me, my bf, his sister and my father. She has never done that. Yes she broke skin in all four instances. Nothing extreme, a tiny puncture in the finger, but now it has become a constant fear for us that she’s gonna seriously injure someone. 

I do truly believe that we can get through it, she’s my baby. I believe that she can have a normal life if we try really really hard with the right professional help. She’s the perfect dog at home. But Outside she’s not even my dog. I don’t recognise her.

1l567tx,https://i.redd.it/00twwwxv1e5f1.png,Trapper.,"The portside bar had mostly cleared out. Finn was still nursing his drink, Sevika returned to her corner. Scar leaned against the doorway as Ekko stood nearby, arms folded. A dry breeze curled through the broken window shutters.

Scar:
“So. We’ve got muscle.”
**(He ticked them off on his fingers.)**
“Spectre, big mama, some poacher she invited, you, me… but we’re missing one thing.”

Ekko didn’t look at him.

Scar:
“For brains.”

Ekko raised an eyebrow. He began to speak.

Scar:
“Don’t say you. We need the other brains.”

Ekko didn’t reply. 

Scar waited, then smirked.

Scar:
“C’mon, you know who I mean.”

Ekko:
“…Yeah.”

Scar straightened up, grin widening.

Scar:
“You, poor bastard, are gonna have to see her. We need a demolitions expert.”

Ekko gave a quiet grunt.

Scar:
“Gods above, I haven’t seen her since she shot that mining rig down in Zaun and blamed it on pigeons.”

Ekko:
“She still claims it was pigeons.”

Scar barked a laugh.

Scar:
“You want backup?”

Ekko shook his head.

Ekko:
“No. I’ll handle it.”

Scar:
“You sure? Last time, you two nearly took out a whole Skytrain.”

Ekko didn’t smile.

Ekko:
“I just need a flight. British Columbia.”

Scar stepped forward and clapped him once on the shoulder. Then he leaned in, quiet.

Scar:
“I’ll meet the others at the Foundation. You take care of your end. Hopefully, by the time you get back—”

Ekko:
“We’ll have it figured out.”

Scar:
“Exactly.”

Scar turned, his coat sweeping the dusty floor. As he stepped out into the dry light beyond the door, his silhouette seemed lighter—looser. Like something in him had clicked into motion again.

Ekko stayed a moment longer, exhaling slowly. Then he moved.

***(A plane ride later)***

British Columbia was soaked in dusk. The kind that filtered gold through redwoods, pooling in the moss, staining the lakes like an old photograph. Ekko’s truck rumbled along a private dirt road, the engine coughing now and then like it didn’t belong here—like it knew it was trespassing.

He rolled down the window. Salt air mixed with pine. The forest was loud with the quiet that only came from not being near people. Then the trees broke, revealing a cabin tucked beside a glassy lake. Clean lines. Modern but lived-in. A wide deck stretched out behind it. Peaceful. Almost sterile.

*Almost.*

Then there was the electric fence, still intact. Still humming.

Ekko muttered.

Ekko:
“Paranoid as ever.”

He parked in the gravel. The security terminal still had the same interface. Still ran on her old custom OS—half bootleg Piltover tech, half garbage she stole from dead shimmer labs. He typed the passphrase.

""FishbonesDieHard.""

The gate popped open.

Then he heard it.

Punk music, loud and bleeding with static, thumping like it wanted to pick a fight with the trees. It came from behind the cabin. He followed the sound, boots crunching through gravel and brush.

Sparks flashed.

Someone was welding. Not professionally—this was fieldwork. Grease, wires, stray bolts. She crouched over something that could’ve been a mine or a coffee maker, hard to tell with her.

Ekko:
“Still alive?”

The welding stopped.

A pause.

Then—

Trapper:
“…Holy shit.”

She turned slowly. Goggles still on, wild blue hair. She had cut her braids off. A popsicle stick jutted out of the corner of her mouth, smeared in oil. She didn’t take it out. She just grinned, wide and sharp.

She stood, peeled off her gloves, and pulled her goggles up. Her eyes scanned him like she was confirming a ghost. She didn’t run up. Didn’t hug him. Just looked.

Jinx:
“Didn’t think I’d see you again without a body bag involved.”

Ekko:
“Got time for a drink?”

Jinx tilted her head, eyes narrowing with exaggerated suspicion.

Jinx:
“Depends. You bring the drinks, or is this a ‘we go out and talk like adults’ kind of offer?”

Ekko:
“You choose.”

Jinx looked toward the cabin. Then back at him.

Jinx:
“…I got cherry bombs in the fridge.”

She flicked the popsicle stick at his chest. It stuck for a second, then fell.

Jinx:
“Hope you like ’em bitter.”

Ekko followed her up the stairs, past coils of wire, homemade explosives, and the faint smell of thermite.

Upstairs, the “office” was more bunker than workspace. Metal panels lined the walls. The lights were dim, flickering slightly from poor wiring or maybe sabotage. Maps, wires, dismantled electronics, tagged photos, half-melted dog tags, and an uncomfortably high number of empty energy drink cans covered the desks and walls. In the center: a cluttered worktable surrounded by disassembled gadgets and weapon blueprints.

Jinx flopped into a half-broken swivel chair. She dug through a drawer, found another lollipop and stuck it in her mouth like a cigarette.

Jinx:
“You’re still wearing long sleeves in the summer. Bet you got tan lines like prison bars.”

Ekko pulled out a folder from his coat. Set it down on the table.

Ekko:
“Didn’t know you kept track of my fashion choices.”

Jinx gave a mock shrug. The lollipop bobbed in her mouth.

Jinx:
“I was bored. You’re on TV, dumbass. Or whatever passes for it now. Watched a few of those paleontology lectures. That one dig site with the fire, the bones? Pretty gnarly.”

Ekko blinked.

Ekko:
“You watched that?”

Jinx smirked.

Jinx:
“Hey, I was really bored.”

He sat across from her and tried to set the papers out in order. She reached out with a screwdriver and poked his elbow.

Jinx:
“You still seeing the pink-haired intern?”

Ekko:
“Eve? No. She’s my student.”

Jinx grinned. Looked down at her armband.

Jinx:
*“She’s cute.”*

Ekko didn’t look up.

Ekko:
“Even if I was seeing her, why would you care?”

Jinx:
“Didn’t say I did.”

Ekko shook his head and ruffled through his bag.

Jinx:
“She is cute, though.”

Ekko didn’t answer. He was already sliding one of the images across the table, but Jinx wasn’t paying attention. She cracked her neck and drummed her fingers on the table, waiting for him to say something else. He didn’t.

Jinx:
“You seeing anyone?”

Ekko:
“Not really.”

Jinx:
“Figures. I’ve been trying not to blow my fingers off in my garage for the last year. That’s my love life.”

She plopped her boots on the table. The chair creaked. Her head tilted, blue eyes meeting his.

Jinx:
“So. How’s the nerd job?”

Ekko hesitated. Then—

Jinx:
“Nevermind. Don’t care.”

Ekko:
“You asked—”

Jinx:
“Because I like hearing you squirm. C’mon. Out with it. What’d you come here for?”

Ekko leaned forward.

Ekko:
“I need you.”

Jinx froze. Eyes wide.

Jinx:
“…Careful what you say next, mister.”

Ekko:
“Not like that.”

Jinx:
“Something wrong with me?”

He groaned. She grinned wider, proud of herself.

He pulled out the photo. The one Scar gave him.

Ekko:
“They found something in Laos. Something old. Scar wants to go in quiet, clean, fast. But they’ll need someone to get rid of the evidence. Dynamite. Mines. The works.”

Jinx sat up, her grin fading. She studied the image, her expression flattening.

Jinx:
“Looks staged.”

Ekko:
“It’s not. You’d know if it was.”

Jinx:
“…This is real?”

Ekko:
“Scar thinks so.”

Jinx whistled through her teeth. She stood and started pacing the room.

Jinx:
“Things are good here, y’know. Stable. I’ve got buyers. Real ones. Government blacklists, rebel states, anti-arcane groups. I’m basically Etsy for psychotics. It pays, Ekko.”

Ekko raised an eyebrow.

Ekko:
“You owe people.”

Jinx:
“I don’t... not owe people.”

Ekko:
“You’ve been dodging payments and scrapping blackboxes since before Piltover fell.”

Jinx:
“Look. I could come. But what if I don’t come back, huh? I’ve got a good thing going here. Power. Food. No one breathing down my neck unless I want them to.”

Ekko pulled out a slip of paper. Bank codes. Stamped and verified. He pushed it toward her.

Ekko:
“This is your cut. Just for showing up. No contracts. Enough to retire. Disappear. No more buyers. No more close calls.”

Jinx stared at it. Eyes narrow. She didn’t pick it up.

Jinx:
“You’re serious.”

Ekko:
“I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t.”

The silence hung. Punk music still thudded through the floorboards, now distant.

Jinx popped the lollipop out of her mouth.

Jinx:
“…What’s the catch?”

Ekko:
“We don’t know what’s out there.”

Another silence.

Then Jinx turned. Opened a drawer. Pulled out a toolkit, tossed it on the table.

Jinx:
“Three days. I’ll need three to prep. Then I want full oversight on the explosives. Placement. Execution. No field grunts touching my work.”

Ekko stood.

Ekko:
“Deal.”

She gave him a look. Still suspicious. Still watching him.

He left the room.

The first date went great from a coffee shop to spending 12h together. We clicked right away. At first, I told him that I am not looking for anything serious and I don’t wanna commit cause I’m leaving the country by the summer. He agreed we started as friends but then a month later we started dating and labeled as a short relationship. At first, I made sure to not get attached but he was amazing. He treated me so good, he remembers every little detail, surprise me with flowers and making sure everything was good. Our last month together we decided to go on a short trip and it was the best time of my whole life. In conclusion, I fall hard and I am way too deep in this. I love him blindly. It’s been two weeks since we I left the country. The last day I told him I don’t wanna end this now just because of distance I got too used to him being in my life and it’s gonna hurt me so badly but he told me that it was my idea in the beginning to be a short relationship and that we will part ways after and that he doesn’t wanna do long distance. Mind you he was the one chasing me in the beginning and he didn’t stop until I become his girl. He told that I shouldn’t invest anymore in this relationship because it’s a dead end and I should just forget abt him and enjoy my life which doesn’t sound like him. I was really hurt and utterly shocked cause I didn’t expect him to let go that easily. Now I feel pretty empty and I don’t know what to do. He text me once in a while just asking how I am and that’s it. I dunno if I should try more or just move on even though I really love him and I have never clicked this quickly with anyone before.

1l564m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1l564m0/is_this_really_anxiety/,Is this really anxiety?,"I have been dealing with anxiety for 13 years of my life. It was worse when I was younger, having untreated ADHD and being constantly overwhelmed in school. I had obsessive thoughts, especially at night when trying to sleep.

I went through many therapists, psychiatrists, and medications, but nothing seemed to make even a little bit of a difference. Sometimes I'd happen to be in a good mood that day and I would tell them the meds were helping but then I'd forget to take them for a week and nothing would change.

Anxiety has prevented me from getting a job, from doing things I wanted to because I was too nervous. But within the last few years, especially after I started getting medicated for ADHD via ritalin, the anxiety was way more manageable. It almost disappeared entirely. Sometimes I'd get it late at night, or when I was worried about the condition of a friend or status of an unpaid bill, but again- worst case scenario I couldn't sleep, and I'd just scroll my phone, watching catch and cook videos until it went away, or vent to someone and that would help. Sometimes I'd smoke a little tiny breadcrumb of weed and that would snuff it right out. I started to get a little more out of my comfort zone- and yeah it was scary at first, but once I knew I could handle it, I could handle it.

But randomly, almost 2 weeks ago, I had some sort of episode. I was having a good day, reading a comic on my computer, when I suddenly felt incredibly dizzy, lightheaded, sorta a flushed feeling, and like I wasn't getting enough air. I went into my mom's room and collapsed. She took my BP and it was incredibly low. My oxygen was fine but I felt like I was suffocating. It was extremely, extremely physically painful- I would compare it to when I almost drowned in a pool when I was 6. A physical sensation I absolutely could not ignore no matter how hard I tried, and this episode continued nonstop- through sleep, through meds, even through alcohol, no matter what. For days. For about 12 hours a day, I lay in bed and gasped for air.

And for each of those days, my family took me to the ER looking for answers, who could never provide any. My pcp put me on Prazosin and Buspirone.

The symptoms got worse. I started choking on my food, regurgitating it. I got horrible chest and stomach pains. Chills so strong they would make my entire body shake. A feeling of heat all over my head, neck, shoulders. I got incredibly overstimulated by everything, flinching in pain at the slightest touch or sound. Even my own thoughts became overstimulating--if I had to pause to think on anything I would get a seering stabbing pain in my chest or head like someone was driving a hot nail into it.

Every day. All the time.

I stopped eating. I couldn't get out of bed. One evening I was in so much pain and so sure I'd die I wrote letters to all of my loved ones. One morning I was home alone and just squirmed and writhed on the floor screaming bloody fucking murder because it was so uncomfortable and I was so tired.

My PCP took me off the prazosin and put me on propranolol which I have also yet to see a difference from. She prescribed me 5 days of clonazepam. It's the only thing that even takes the edge off. I felt the pain, and I still felt like I couldn't breathe. My diaphragm aches.

I had to stop my ritalin, and drinking coffee--two of the only things in the world that helped my ADHD. I'm miserable. I'm in so much pain. I have little to no room for joy. I lay in bed in the dark all day knowing nothing but the pain and discomfort, and once every couple of hours the overstimulation will subside just enough that I may be able to listen to music. I'm missing out on plans I made.

Everyone is telling me this is anxiety, but I have never heard of nor experienced it being like THIS. I have heard about anxiety causing health worry--sometimes you'll manifest symptoms of something if you're worried about having it. I've done it. I've had anxiety so severe that it felt like a painful pressure in my head or chest. Sometimes I'd get bad news and feel my heart skip a beat. But I could generally tell where it was coming from, or if not, find something I liked to do that was an effective distraction.

But it doesn't matter how many times the doctors tell me my tests are normal. It doesn't matter how long I spend doing breathing techniques or counting 5 objects I can see. It doesn't matter if I'm doing my favorite activity in the whole world. The pain is so unbearable, so great, and I can't pay attention to anything else. If this is anxiety, will I ever escape it? Is this ever going to end, or is this just my life now?",1,1749250958.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False
