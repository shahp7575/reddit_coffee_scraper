1j66vd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1j66vd6/hunger_causing_bad_flare_up/,Hunger causing bad flare up???,"
Hi there! I have GERD and am currently experiencing: nausea, acid reflux, sore throat (that feels like I need to hiccup?), chills (thinking from anxiety AND our heat was off), burning in stomach-- on top of that, I feel hungry, but the nausea is making me worried about trying to eat. 

Does anyone else experience these things?? I'm a little worried only because of the nausea- but because I'm hungry is that making me feel like this?? Is it triggering my GERD? 

Earlier today I ate waffles, veggie nests, and mac n cheese puffs-- and coffee! My last meal was 6 hours ago!

EDIT: I have pretty bad emetophobia that I'm working hard on getting better with!! But the nausea part of this really gets me anxious haha",1,1741400313.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
1j66sc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1j66sc2/i_am_so_happy_with_these_improvements/,I am so happy with these improvements,"First I cut down to half a cup of coffee almost a month ago, then 150 ml, 100 ml and now I am at 50 ml of coffee. I’m gonna continue at 50ml for a little while. 

I am feeling better and better, and I think it’s likely because of my sleep quality improving. I seriously couldn’t remember the last time I’d slept well in a really long time, so I decided to quit coffee. 

I’ve been having night terrors consistently, meaning I think a shadow is some intruder and scream and then wake up. My boyfriend says I haven’t had them for this last week (and maybe longer I didn’t ask until now). 

I also have (voluntary) tics, so hopefully they continue to lessen because so far I’ve noticed a decrease in the urgency to do the tics (clench my jaw, squeeze and contract muscles all over my body). There is no way the decrease in the feeling of urgency to do the tics is placebo. 

I was close to getting a sleep study done, but I don’t think I will if these symptoms (tics, depression, night terrors, non-restful sleep) continue to improve ",1,1741400040.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1j66rys,https://www.reddit.com/r/estatesales/comments/1j66rys/ever_ran_into_a_really_bad_apple/,Ever ran into a really bad apple?,"I wish I was making this up.

Some people view estate sales as if they are the last estate sale ever held, and get way too competitive. Personally, I try to avoid confrontation. 

I waited a little over 2 hours for a number, this older lady who looked like she had a history of hard drug usage and her daughter, literally walk right in front of me to get a number. This made me a bit peeved, but being off a number or two isn't the end of the world.

Hour between numbers and the sale, so I go to a nearby gas station to get some coffee. One restroom was in use and I really needed to go. I wait 10 minutes and apparently they had fallen asleep in there, so I tell the cashier and the other restroom, which was out of order, the nano-second she takes the sign off the door, (I guess they fixed it and forgot to take the sign down) the same lady comes out of nowhere and walks right in front of me to use the damn bathroom. 

I go in after her, the sink was bone dry, the toilet wasn't filling back up - meaning she was probably in there using.

Go inside the sale once it opens, and her and her daughter are literally filling tote bags full of jewelry. When  There's probably 10 or so flats of jewelry and smalls. 

They see me, and start going through a flat, but the way the house was situated, I would need to wait for them to move to go further down the living room and look at more stuff. 

I watch as they literally go through this same flat 5 times. There's maybe 8 pieces of jewelry in this flat. 

So after watching them pick up these 8 items, look at them, and sit them down down five times, I realize they are purposely being in my way. 

However, they finally start sauntering further down maybe a foot, and once I was closer, I see one piece of jewelry that looked decent, and right as they start moving down again, I reach in the flat to pick it up, and she starts reaching for it, stops, and the daughter sees this and starts getting huffy with me, accusing me of ""taking something out of her mom's hand"". I told her I don't pull that shit and literally sat it back down in the flat, and she says ""Ya whatever buddy"" and rolls her eyes.

I have no clue what their damn issue was, but these are the types of people I hate seeing at sales. 

They know I know jewelry and since that's their ""niche"", they want to act like assholes to try and have me retaliate and get me kicked out. 

I can see right through their BS and I'll act like Mr Rogers to their face, and I could tell their little ""trap"" of trying to get me pissed off at them, made them even more mad when they realized I'm not falling for that shit.

But by doing so, I'm letting myself get increasingly annoyed with coworkers, especially the more extroverted ones.  Which makes me wonder if it's fair to them that I'm letting that happen.  Like they say goodmorning every morning.  Every day in the break room, they're saying how are you and initiating pointless smalltalk.  So I'm building up resentment toward the person who won't let me get my coffee in peace when he thinks he's strengthening our relationship and being polite. 

But if I said anything, I'd look bad, maybe even get spoken to by leadership for not being a team player or whatever jargon they use nowadays.  But they're really shooting themselves in the foot because if I'm not saying anything, I'm building up resentment until I'll eventually quit, become less efficient, etc

1j66nrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/visualsnow/comments/1j66nrn/my_progress/,My progress,"Im going to just explain my last 2-3 months and skip most of my vss/palinopsia onset. If anyone would like to relate to my story and symptoms, please feel free to check my profile and view my previous posts. 

So this is both a 'motivation and progress' and a 'recovery progress' post. I never really managed to pinpoint my exact cause for vss as with many others in this subreddit, it could be constant inflammation from years of chronic sinusitis, could be the brain reacting to my anxiety struggles, could be because of my vitreous detachment. There's so many things I could add on.

I started experiencing vss symptoms in mid 2020 after being diagnosed with lattice degeneration, things stayed stable for 4 years. Atleast I believed it did. Out of nowhere my palinopsia became noticeable, it impacted many daily aspects of my life. I could not enjoy the my life the way I wanted to.

I think around October of last year my girlfriend dumped me, and Id say I blame the break up a little on my vss. Because I was hella depressed and I became immature and too dependent on others despite being 20.

A week after the break up I realized that most of my symptoms had actually calmed down, it baffled me. Because if I was depressed over my symptoms, let me tell you that I was even more depressed over losing the girl I loved.

I took the chance to improve on both the physical and mental. My goal suddenly became to become a stronger person. I started eating healthier. I completely cut out caffeine, only drinking coffee or coca cola on very special occasions. I don't drink nor have I ever done any recreational drugs so that was easy to avoid.

Instead of focusing on wasteful imaging of my brain which revealed nothing, I focused on other parts of my body. I managed to get proper help for my sinus issues. Managed to see a dietitian who helped with my digestive issues (I had an upset stomach almost everyday). Worked with physiotherapy to loosen up my muscles, especially around my neck.

Upped my protein intake and slowly got over my fear of working out (I had suffered from tendinitis after a bicep injury 2 years prior) i went slow and paced myself. Exercise really helped. I made sure to eat a lot of greens, broccoli, carrots for eye health (I know vss manifests everywhere but the physical eye itself). So diet and exercise wise I am holding steady.

I fixed my sleep schedule, I did quit my job when my palinopsia got worse because I was mentally not ready. But now I make sure I get 7-9 hours of sleep everyday so Im never exhausted. I started taking vitamin b complex supplements. This one really improved my sleep and appetite. I finally got the help I always needed and enrolled into therapy. Where I learned the roots of my anxiety and managed to calm myself down for the first time in over a decade.

All the while, I ignored my symptoms. And after a few months I can say that Im still not cured, but my symptoms have reduced by almost 80%. I only see the snow in pitch dark places and sometimes in low light. My light sensitivity has reduced to the point that I don't have to squint while wearing my sunglasses. I no longer see phosphenes as usual and they dont last long (blotches of afterimages from no light source) bfep? What's that? Cause it seems to have disappeared completely. Palinopsia has reduced by 60-70%. Sometimes it does flair up depending on how tired I am. Floaters never bothered me but now I don't notice them unless im absolutely looking for them.

### Instructions for The Lemon Coffee Weight Loss Recipe

Squeeze out the lemon and put it into your coffee. Stir well. Some folks think this helps to cleanse the body of all the impurities. Lemon is good for Vitamin C. Hydration is improved with this drink, too. But do not think lemon coffee can do a miracle. If you drink too much lemon, your belly might hurt.

Other Ingredients to Boost Your Weight Loss Coffee
--------------------------------------------------

I find other things that mix well into coffee for an additional boost.

### Additional Superfood Ingredients for weight loss coffee

Chia seeds, flax seeds, ginger, or turmeric are all things you must have.

Chia seeds expand when they get wet and you feel full faster. Flax seeds assist with bowel movements. Ginger has spice that helps waken you. Turmeric has healing properties. I stir these into coffee. The added boost is a plus. Test them out yourself and see what you like to make.

Too much coffee has a bad effect on people.

 I replied back to his messages and we shared face pics and nudes and everything. He is very attractive for his age not muscled of course but slim bold headed. We make a plan to meet up in person  and get to know each other more.

 A week before  meetup we still messaging each other thru the hookup app and asking about our day and talk and joke openly about most things in our conversations with some lots of heart emojies.

Finally we met today for the coffee date, he is good looking like I said. He was asking me about my life,  the work I do... I layed everything  about my life out for him for transparency and i also told him that I'll be graduation this Spring and MAYBE move to a different State.

I asked about his life and what does for work He said that he has an adopted kid with his ex and share custody and all that  and has a small business. It was even hard for him to tell me what kind of small business he has. But I can help to feel he doesn't want tell me too much about his life and he is being cautious about what to tell me.

We were conversing when he told me he has a meeting soon that we'll have to go. When we where leaving, he was just leaving and I have to ask him if  there will be a second time date or something and he said i don't know and I asked him if he wanted to exchange phone number.

 He said ""I'll send it to you in the app"".  That broke my heart. I didn't say anything and left.

Did I mess it up somewhere?  I really wanted to get to know him and maybe hope for something good but it doesn't seem that he is interested like i am after meeting in person. 

And he hasn't send me phone number till now. I just want to tell him if he is not interested that is fine we can both move on. I just don't know if he still interested or not. But my nudes album still open for him.

 For the past six months, I've been on a mission to find the best matcha. I’ve visited nearly every store in my area that sells it, and after plenty of trial and error, I’ve managed to replicate, tweak, and even improve some of the recipes. While this might not seem like a big deal, my area seriously lacks high-quality matcha drinks and desserts. So far, my go-to creations include: Iced matcha Ube cold foam Vanilla cold foam Honey matcha Matcha tiramisu I know this is a relatively short list, and the recipes are fairly simple, but in my area, the best matcha option available is Starbucks. No one within a 30-mile radius offers ube cold foam matcha—or even ube anything—except for one coffee shop, and they don’t sell matcha at all. 

The local demographics suggest a strong market for these drinks. A significant portion of the people out and about—especially those walking the nearby nature trails—are between 15 and 40 years old and likely interested in specialty drinks. I live in a suburban neighborhood near Portland, where there’s a steady flow of foot traffic daily. Coffee shops, boba spots, and especially those that serve matcha are always packed, no matter the season. However, the matcha I’ve tried is often disappointing—watered down and lacking depth. Despite this, people still pay around $7–8 per cup, which seems absurd to me, depending on the shop. 

My area also lacks of supply, where there is no steadily available matcha powder, or ube flavor, although I have a source for it. At a $5 rate, profit is around 40%. 

While I don’t have any experience running a physical business or food stand, I do have some background in online sales from a small shop I managed a while ago. So, I understand the basics of running a business if things go well—but when it comes to setting up a physical shop, I’m not sure where to start, or if my hope of this working is imaginary. 

My target audience for this business would be people age 15-40, as media like TikTok and instagram has driven this market up from where it was.

I'm not looking to start up a physical store, as I do not have the assets for this, but possibly a stand, like a lemonade stand at a local park. If I could set up at the local community college, sales would be insane, but it seems like it won't be happening as I have not gotten an email in return.

TDLR :  Rate my business idea of opening a lemonade stand, but instead of lemonade, it's a matcha stand, at a nearby park with allot of foot traffic. Are there any repercussions, should I get any permit beforehand as I am only doing a trial (1-3 days.) If it helps, I look young enough where people still call me ""bud."" I plan to sell every cup of matcha for $5 regardless of contents. Every cup is regular size & will be the same cups as competitor shops. I can replicate recipes endlessly & quality of repetition is always good.

1j6622i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6622i,Finally a solution!!,"Going to make this short and sweet — I first got diagnosed by a doctor with rosacea 3 years ago. My first flair was awful. Especially since I never struggled with acne before. My doctor prescribed me oral antibiotics but I refused to take any antibiotics. I ended up healing completely with my esthetician through skin care, red light therapy and 5 sessions of IPL. (I came out of it with glass skin lol). I thought I was completely in the clear until this past September when I had a flair again. Unfortunately this time it was unbearable, it started on my left side and then to my right. It was also painful and very inflamed. Nothing was helping and skin. 

I joined this sub and tried everything:

- zinc soap — made my skin worse and irritated 
- zinc cream — made my skin worse 
- switched to a lighter hydrating cleanser (LRP toleraine) this helped a lot 
- tried an elimination diet, no gluten, no dairy, no coffee — this did nothing 
- cicaolast baume — made my skin worse 

Finally, I got in with my derm and she was amazing. She prescribed me a triple cream of ivermectin, azelaic acid and metronidazole. When I tell you this completely changed my skin like nothing else!!!!! She said it could take 3 months to see any progress but I saw almost immediate relief. I’m continuing to use it daily as prescribed and will probably continue using for a long long time. And now I’m just dealing with some scarring and PIE which I’ll address with my esthetician. Moral of the story: don’t hold off, go see a derm!!!! It’s not a one size fit all skin condition and I’m still working at it :) 

First two photos are before I started the triple cream. Last photo is 3 months in to using the cream.

AM 
Cleanse with LRP toleraine dermo cleanser

PM 

Cleanse with LRP toleraine dermo cleanser

We took a couple of months off work so we could spend some time together after the wedding to have a longish honeymoon. About a month and a half in, she receives an email while she is taking a shower, titled “What a Sad Tragedy”. Fearing the worst, I opened the email. It came from what I could only assume was an Ex boyfriend. It said something along the lines of “I just found out you got married. I should have never pushed you away. I only hope you give me an opportunity to talk to you again.”

I brushed it off, mainly because before getting married I was also contacted by a couple of exgirlfriends. One to congratulate me, one expecting me to tell her I was marrying my second option. Crazy. I thought no more of the email my wife received, but the name of the sender stayed with me because it is not very common.

Fast forward 10 years. We have two kids; the oldest one is special needs. We have had a bad relationship for years. The stress of our special needs son weights heavy on us.

On January 16th 2025, her business is going thru an audit. She gets upset every time I ask about her finances and how she runs her business. But that day she leaves her laptop open while she is upstairs with our kids. I snoop in, trying to find out how the audit is going. Then, I see a man on her computer she instant messaged that day. I click on it thinking it is her accountant. He sent a picture of himself in a suit. She responded with an emoji heart, and a message saying, “I am busy, I’ll call you later”.

First red flag🚩: It was obvious to me she had deleted all previous conversations with him.  
The only other reference I find of him, is she talking about him to one of our friends who sells retirement plans and insurances. She contacted our friend back in October, 4 months ago.

Second red flag🚩: She is introducing AP, to our friend, but my wife claims she does not know him, she says it is just a random client of hers. But I search her client list, and AP is not there.

Then I remember the name.

So, I go upstairs and ask, “Who is Ambrose Wilfred?”(Fake Name)  
Third red flag🚩: She panics and answers “Who?” feigning ignorance. “Who is Ambrose Wilfred?”. After a few seconds that felt like a year, she answered “He is someone from my past. Someone who has been in my life, and today I just told him he looked handsome”. If she told him he looked handsome, it was over a call, not in a text.

I don’t remember much after that. It was like a bucket of cold water.

Fourth red flag🚩: Trickle truth begins. She tells me he just contacted her 2 weeks ago. I tell her not to lie, because she was already talking about insurance and portfolio investments to him. She changes her story saying “Ok, it was a couple months ago”.

Fifth red flag?🚩: I ask her “what is him of yours?”. And she could not answer me. “Is he a friend?” “No” Ex-boyfriend?” “No” “Lover, FWB, affair partner?” “No, no, no”.

Sixth red flag🚩: I ask her ""can I see your phone to see how you contact him?” She says “Sure, go ahead.” She thought I would only search her instant messages. But I went for the call logs. They were calling each other dozens and dozens of times. There was one day they called each other 35 minutes in three different calls. Not even when I was working abroad would she call me that often, for that long. I felt weak, I could not scroll all the way down. Remember, we have a special need son. Our days are so busy just trying to take care of his needs. How did she find the time to call him of that long?!

seventh red flag🚩: She tells me she spoke to him sometimes to confide to him when we were having marital problems.

I ask: “Are you having sex with him?” “No, you have been my one and only. I have not seen him since before we became bf and gf. He lives in a different state.” This is the one thing I believe.

“Are you having an EA with him?” “No, I never told him that I love him or that I like him. I am not in love with him. We started talking because he was kidnapped last year” “And you believe him?” “Yes.” “Let me guess, after he told you he was kidnapped, he also told you that being in danger really ‘put into focus the people who are important to you’”. Silence.

She cuts contact with him. We fight for the next couple of days. She kept saying she did nothing wrong, she kept saying that she didn’t realize what she was doing could be misconstrued as something malicious.

We have a showdown that weekend. I ask her if he is married. She says yes. “How long has he been married?” She thinks he told her he has been married for 14 years. “14 years?! So, he sent you that initial email being a married man?! What a tool!” When I first read the email, I thought it was just a bitter exboyfriend. But no. Age has shown me that players and serial cheaters actually reach out for married woman because there are less strings attached there. My past relationships contacted me before the wedding, but he contacted her after the wedding. A married man, reaching to a married woman about how bad he wants to talk to her. And he is 9-10 years older than her!.

I tell her that in order to move forward she had to:

1. cut the narrative that she didn’t know she was doing something wrong.
2. She had to contact AP’s wife and tell her everything. (She never accepted to do this)
3. She had to come clear as to when they started talking again.

Next day she tells me that the earliest call she could recover using ordinary android tools, was from April 2024. I believed her at the time. She is lovey Dovey with me for about a week.

Fast forward to valentine’s day. In trying to fix things, I give her flowers, and a couple of gifts so that the kids can give to their mother. She last minute gets me a Starbucks coffee and a balloon. I tell her that what I really want is to share a bottle of wine and talk more about the incident. She still doesn’t think there was an affair. I ask about 50 questions that were haunting me for about a month. But three things stood out:

1. If he was “Kidnaped” around October, what were you guys talking about in April? She didn’t remember.
2. At some point she said “I don’t have a clear timeline of the time we spoke over the phone. Some years we only spoke over the phone once”. The wine in her didn’t even let her register what she just said. They had been in contact for years.
3. She still could not bring herself to call him a friend or lover.

I did not let her know about her slip. But it kept bothering me that weekend.

Finally, that Sunday, I confronted her about her lies. IF she didn’t remember what they talked about in April, it was because they didn’t start to reconnect in April. They had been talking for years.

The next Monday, she finally admitted she had an EA, mainly because a guilt-free spouse does not delete conversations. But she maintains she only lied about dates. She is still saying he is nothing to her, not even her friend.

I feel like I am drowning. She of course says I am drowning in a glass of water. IF it were not for our special needs son, I probably would have left already.

Today she finally admitted they were actually flirting, after denying it for month and a half.

I am hurt and I don’t know how to move forward.

I am so disappointed she fell for this old guy (he is 9 years older than her), ugly, married, obvious womanizer.

I had already shared this story in a different forum. Unfortunately, most of the responese were trying to convince me that she had a physical affair. While that is a possibility, that is not my current reality. There has not been a single red flag that would point to them being together in the last 5 years, at least.   
  
But the emotional affair still sucks; it does not need to become PA to give you PTSD. In fact, I think since it was never physical, since they were never ""friends"", ironically, is what gave her the permission to open up even more to him. Would it have ended in time in a PA? Who knows? But I am tired of her dismissing my pain because there was nothing physical. ",5,1741397169.0,Marriage,3,0.86,False

I usely make coffee like Nescafe 2g coffee powder + 1/4 glass milk + 3/4 water and boil them and that's how I make coffee. Can anyone tell me better or the right way.

Summers are here so in summer cold coffee is a good option. And i personally like cold coffee but rarely drink in the market. So pls tell me how I should make it at home in india.

And i also heard that nescafe coffee isn't original coffee so I ordered the coffee powder below. Can anyone check it. Is it relevant or not ?

TLDR: Visited a coffee shop and have interacted everytime with the same person taking my order and making my drink.. The latest time they went out of their way and gave me a couple extra cookies..are they flirting with me?? Calling all baristas! Is this something that you typically do with customers??

I started going to a new coffee shop after my friend told me about it. And I keep finding myself back there. So I got helped by someone and it was normal interaction.

 The week after I go again without any thoughts, and that same person this time was making my drink, then they said, nice to see you again! Which caught me off guard because I don't typically make conversations so am surprised they remembered me... Following this, they said should I make a good one for ya, I said 'would love that'...then went on my merry way. 

I stopped by again this week, and again they said hey, asked how my week was and I got a cookie, then said ""all good to go, my dear"" While I was waiting for a my drink, they came up to me with a couple extra cookies and asked if I wanted them because they didn't come out great of the oven.. this is where I need help...I can't tell if they are just great at their job or if it's just me..lol

It was even hard for him to tell me what kind of small business he has. But I can help to feel he doesn't want tell me too much about his life and he is being cautious about what to tell me.

We were conversing when he told me he has a meeting soon that we'll have to go. When we where leaving, he was just leaving and I have to ask him if  there will be a second time date or something and he said i don't know and I asked him if he wanted to exchange phone number.

 He said ""I'll send it to you in the app"".  That broke my heart. I didn't say anything and left.

Did I mess it up somewhere?  I really wanted to get to know him and maybe hope for something good but it doesn't seem that he is interested like i am after meeting in person. 

And he hasn't send me phone number till now. I just want to tell him if he is not interested that is fine we can both move on. I just don't know if he still interested or not. But my nudes album still open for him.

1j65n9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1j65n9l/intimate_tracking_app/,Intimate Tracking App,"This might not be everyone's 'cup of tea' but thought I would share... After some time away from Rails I have returned and thoroughly enjoying it, completing both professional and personal projects in Rails over the last few months has been great.

  
Following a discussion with some friends who were trying to improve their 'intimate' life and had tried using various apps and what not, they felt the apps were a bit 'seedy' plus most of them have a in app purchase model to really get the full functionality of the app. They said 'Hey you are a software developer, can you make us something more intimate?'.

  
So that I did, introducing Intimit - a platform for tracking your intimate encounters. The app can be used solo, in a relationship, situationship or any variation in between. The app is 100% Rails with some Stimulus controllers for better user experience. It is totally free to use (or you can buy me a coffee). It captures a range of data about your intimate experiences and returns some analytics, calendar and various other data points that may be of interest and/or relevance.

  
To ensure privacy is a key component of the platform, all user details are encrypted in the database including name, email address, partners name, partners email address etc. 

  
Would love some feedback from fellow devs or anyone who may have a more 'practical' use for the app. Currently its just on a [fly.io](http://fly.io) domain but if it gains more traction I may get its own dedicated domain: [https://intimit.fly.dev/](https://intimit.fly.dev/)

Why It’s Revolutionary: It doesn’t just entertain—it fundamentally alters how we experience life, blending physical and digital realities seamlessly.
Universal Need: Escapism and mental well-being are universal desires; this makes them accessible instantly.
Monetization: Sell AR hardware with a subscription for custom “reality packs” (e.g., “Tropical Paradise” or “Sci-Fi Adventure”).
Crazy Factor: You could live in a completely different world while still functioning in this one—reality becomes optional.


3. AI Time Broker
What It Does: This AI masters time management on a societal scale, buying and selling “time” as a commodity. It optimizes every person’s schedule, trades unused time slots, and even predicts when you’ll need rest or work, creating a global time economy.
Why It’s Revolutionary: Time is our most precious resource—this AI makes it tangible, tradable, and universally optimized.
Universal Need: Everyone wants more time; this gives it to them by squeezing efficiency out of every second.
Monetization: Take a cut of every “time transaction” or charge for premium scheduling features.
Crazy Factor: It could turn time into literal currency—imagine paying for a coffee with 10 minutes of your day.


4. AI Dream Engineer
What It Does: This AI hacks into your brain waves during sleep to design and direct your dreams, turning every night into a custom adventure, learning experience, or therapy session.
Why It’s Revolutionary: Sleep becomes productive and entertaining, not just rest. It’s a whole new frontier of human experience.
Universal Need: Everyone sleeps—now everyone can dream better, learn faster, or heal emotionally overnight.
Monetization: Sell dream-design subscriptions (e.g., “Epic Adventure Pack” or “Problem-Solving Dreams”) with wearable tech.
Crazy Factor: You could live a second life in your dreams, complete with AI-generated plots and characters.


5. AI Collective Consciousness Hub
What It Does: Connects every human mind into a shared AI network, allowing real-time thought exchange, collective problem-solving, and a unified “global brain” that evolves with us.
Why It’s Revolutionary: It’s not just communication—it’s merging human consciousness with AI to create a species-wide intelligence leap.
Universal Need: Connection and collaboration are primal; this takes them to an cosmic level.
Monetization: Charge for access to the network or sell insights from the collective mind to businesses/governments.
Crazy Factor: Humanity becomes a hive mind, with AI as the glue—privacy’s out, unity’s in.


6. AI Matter Manipulator
What It Does: Uses AI to control nanotechnology that rearranges matter at the atomic level, letting you “print” anything—food, houses, even organs—on demand.
Why It’s Revolutionary: It’s not manufacturing—it’s creation from thin air, solving scarcity forever.
Universal Need: Food, shelter, and health are basic needs; this delivers them instantly to everyone.
Monetization: Sell the tech to governments or license “matter templates” (e.g., “Steak Dinner” or “Luxury Car”).
Crazy Factor: You could turn dirt into gold—literally alchemy meets AI.


7. AI Emotion Marketplace
What It Does: This AI maps and digitizes human emotions, letting you buy, sell, or trade feelings. Need courage? Download it. Want joy? Rent it for an hour.
Why It’s Revolutionary: Emotions become a service—mental states are no longer random but curated.
Universal Need: Everyone craves emotional control; this makes it a transaction.
Monetization: Run an “emotion store” with microtransactions or subscriptions for mood packages.
Crazy Factor: You could outsource your entire emotional life to AI, living as a perfectly balanced human.


8. AI Gravity Defier
What It Does: Harnesses AI to manipulate gravitational fields, enabling personal flight, floating cities, or zero-gravity living spaces.
Why It’s Revolutionary: It’s not just transport—it’s rewriting physics for daily life, like the automobile redefined distance.
Universal Need: Freedom of movement is universal; this takes it to the skies.
Monetization: Sell personal flight devices or build floating real estate.
Crazy Factor: Gravity becomes optional—imagine a world where “up” is wherever you want it to be.


9. AI Identity Sculptor
What It Does: This AI lets you redesign your entire identity—appearance, voice, memories, skills—via digital avatars and neural implants, making you whoever you want to be.
Why It’s Revolutionary: It’s not a mask—it’s a total reinvention of self, blurring the line between real and virtual.
Universal Need: Self-expression and reinvention are human obsessions; this makes them limitless.
Monetization: Charge for identity “upgrades” or sell virtual personas for online/offline use.
Crazy Factor: You could live as a different person every day—or a thousand people at once.


10. AI Eternity Engine
What It Does: Digitizes your consciousness and evolves it indefinitely within an AI simulation, offering immortality as a service while your body rests or after it’s gone.
Why It’s Revolutionary: Death becomes optional—your mind lives forever, exploring infinite realities.
Universal Need: Everyone fears mortality; this conquers it.
Monetization: Sell “eternity plans” with tiered simulations (e.g., “Basic Afterlife” vs. “Cosmic Explorer”).
Crazy Factor: You could exist as pure AI, colonizing the universe without a body.a


Why These Are the Next “Automobile”

Ford’s automobile didn’t just solve transportation—it unlocked freedom, reshaped cities, and built economies. These ideas do the same for the AI age:

Universal Appeal: They tap into primal needs—time, freedom, happiness, survival—that every human shares.
Uncharted Territory: No one’s fully cracked these yet; you’d be the pioneer.
Scalable Impact: Like cars, they start personal but could transform society, infrastructure, and culture.

How to Make It Happen

Start Wild, Then Refine: Build a proof-of-concept for the craziest part (e.g., a dream-editing wearable, a time-trading app).
Leverage Existing Tech: Combine AI with AR, nanotech, or brain-computer interfaces—don’t reinvent the wheel, just steer it somewhere insane.

Sell the Vision: Pitch to billionaires, governments, or crowdfund—people love bold dreams.
Ignore the Naysayers: These are “almost crazy” for a reason—disruption looks nuts until it works.

Pick Your Revolution
These aren’t safe bets—they’re moonshots. But if one hits, you’re not just rich—you’re legendary. Which one sparks your imagination? The Dream Engineer turning sleep into gold? The Matter Manipulator ending scarcity? The Eternity Engine cheating death? Tell me where you want to go, and I’ll help you map the first step. The world’s ready for your AI revolution—let’s make it unreal!",0,1741396190.0,grok,2,0.5,False
1j65jia,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j65jia/im_seeing_things/,I'm seeing things,"I keep seeing things at night. Faces, usually. Or like some sort of silhouette in the corner. Relatable? I’m sure it is, because everyone’s mind plays those tricks. Pile of clothes on your chair? That shit turns into the hatman crouched by the end of your bed at 3am. But lately I'm seeing things that really aren’t there. I’ll see a figure in the corner of the room, but there’s no pile of clothes or hanging bag to explain why my brain convinced itself of this creature’s presence. I will see the outline of *something* in the dark, but as soon as I turn my lamp on, it is literally an empty corner.

Full disclosure, I’ve been known to have hallucinations now and then. I have a pretty mild form of bipolar, and when I’ve been under incredible stress as a teen, I’ve had these kind of dreams where I’m actually awake, but just barely. I used to occasionally see things or people in my bedroom, but it would never last long, and I'd always realise it wasn't real. I’m not sure if that meets the criteria for a hallucination or not, because it is in that half asleep state, but I guess it’s important context that I’ve been known to have a few issues with that kind of thing. You’re probably reading that and thinking ‘mystery solved, it’s just some sort of hallucination come nightmare’. That’s what I thought, too.

I started noticing it after my insomnia would flare up - it’s pretty typical for someone with bipolar to have sleep issues, so every now and then my body clock gets fucked over and I’m practically nocturnal. I work at a bar and my shifts vary from afternoon-evening and evening-night, so it’s not a huge issue for me as long as I manage to sleep a few hours in the morning. I tend to just lay in bed watching YouTube or Netflix, trying not to disturb my flatmates. I’ve had these sleep issues for years, and I’m not usually spooked out by the whole 3am ‘witching hour’ thing, but for some reason my skin started crawling at around 3am every night a few months ago. Not because I was aware of the time, to be honest the night becomes a blur of me attempting to sleep while keeping myself occupied with random video essays or shitty Netflix dramas, but after a few nights of this feeling, I realised it was happening at a similar time. You know that feeling when you’ve just watched a particularly disturbing psychological thriller, and you can’t shake the feeling it’s somehow real and you’re next, despite knowing full well that’s impossible? That’s how I’d describe the feeling. I knew - or at least believed - that it was a totally irrational feeling. But that didn’t make it go away. Usually I’d make sure I was watching something chilled out and funny to drown out the feelings, and eventually fall asleep.

That was until I started seeing things. It was just little shadows in my peripheral vision at first, easy to rationalise away as my mind playing tricks. The outline of a person, something moving in the corner - I think most people think they see things like that when it's late, you're tired, and have the creeps. I would just sense something off, get that feeling someone was watching, mistake a shadow for something more tangiable. It took some time before it became prominent enough for me to be actually concerned about it, but then it wasn’t just in my peripheries anymore. I could glance over and see something there, if only briefly. Sometimes it was just a black lump, similar to the shape of a person hunched up in a ball, sometimes I could swear that this thing had a face, just peeking out at me, watching. When I’d look away to grab my phone for the flashlight, or to turn my lamp on, it would be gone. Even before the light was turned on, I could tell it had vanished. Just looking away was enough to shake the 'hallucination', so eventually, whenever I'd see something, I'd force myself to look away for a few seconds, and it would be gone. I knew that the more you feed into a paranoia, the stronger it gets, so I tried my best to act like it was nothing. Because of my history with “kinda” hallucinations, I didn’t think it could’ve been real. I doubled down hard on my plan of just looking away and not giving this thing any attention, and I was sure it would just go away if I kept it up. Ghosts aren’t real.

The strange thing to me was that my life was going pretty well. As I said, the only time I had ever hallucinated was when I was under extreme stress, so I was pretty confused about the whole thing. I loved my job, I had made a lot of new friends, and I overall felt good about myself. So why was this happening now? I knew I should probably speak with a doctor, but honestly I thought once my sleep schedule got a bit more normal that things would clear up naturally. I’ve never enjoyed the times where my body clock gets stuck on nocturnal mode much, I never feel quite as rested even if I do get a full 8 hours, so I brushed it off as more of a sleep/tiredness issue than anything else. My nightly routine consisted of me trying my hardest to fall asleep before 3am, failing miserably, getting the chills, and avoiding looking at anything other than my laptop screen in front of me. It never quite worked, I’d often see a pale face in my periphery, just peering from the corner, but I refused to give it power. ""It's all in your head"", I'd repeat over and over to myself.

After a long shift at work one Friday night, I was incredibly tired, but knew my body probably wouldn’t let me sleep until 4/5am, so got stuck into a new Netflix series. I’d become so accustomed to the uncomfortable feeling that always struck me at around 3am that I nearly didn’t notice it beginning. But then it slowly got more noticeable. I couldn’t focus on the new series that I was actually enjoying, but I tried to tune back in. I kept telling myself that the less I focus on it, the less power these hallucinations have.

Then I saw it. 

In the corner of my room, the figure was just sat upright, staring straight at me. It looked like a person, but something told me it wasn't. I don't know if it was that its smile was too wide, or its eyes too dark and empty. I just knew it wasn’t. 

I looked at it. I looked away. I looked back. Still there.

It was so dark, my eyes could just about make out the figure, but I was certain it was there. Like I said before, there was nothing else there, just a blank wall. No furniture, no clothes, nothing that could be mistaken for a figure in the dark. This is when I really stated to doubt that this was just a figment of my imagination. My body froze, but my fingers scrambled to grab my phone to try and get a proper glimpse of this thing. I clicked on the flashlight icon and shone it to the corner of the room.

 There was nothing there.

 Clearly this was all in my head, there's just no way that thing was real. I knew something was wrong deep down, but I kept on blaming it on my bipolar and poor sleep. Sure, I’d never had anything like this happen to me other than the odd hallucination as a teenager, and sure this thing was sticking around longer and longer, but there’s just no way it’s anything but a hallucination. Despite trying to convince myself of this, I didn’t sleep that night. Not until the sun had risen.

I think the exhaustion of not sleeping properly mixed with the anxiety I felt for the rest of that day led me to be able to sleep a lot earlier that night, probably at around midnight, after a long shift at work. I slept with the light on, which I usually can't do as its too disruptive to me, but this time it was comforting. I slept for nearly 12 hours in a restless sleep, and woke up with adrenaline coursing through my veins. I often get nightmares that I can't really recall in the morning which have this effect on me, but with everything that had been happening it set me off on a bad tone. My room seemed a lot messier than I had remembered leaving it - clothes left across the floor, my art supplies scattered across my desk, glasses of water across the dresser. I guessed I must've been so tired I wasn't really aware of my own actions the night before, but it was odd. I had the day off, so I cleaned up and tried my best to relax for the rest of the day, knowing that stress would only make things worse. Throughout the rest of the day, I suffered with migraines and flashing lights in my vision. Everything felt wrong. 

That night, I started to doze off at around midnight again. As I looked at the time before I shut my eyes, I felt relieved. ""This will be the end of those fucked up hallucinations, if I can just get my sleep schedule back to normal"", I said to myself, knowing the creepy shit only seemed to happen at around 3am, and let myself fall asleep.

Then, I was woken up by something. Scratching, coming from the same corner I saw that fucking creature. I was almost rhythmic - four little fast scratches, a slight pause, and then a fast scratch followed by one long, loud scratch. Over, and over, and over. I felt terrified to open my eyes. I was sure I was awake, but I tried that technique they teach you about nightmares to try and lucid dream, try and imagine you are somewhere nice or you have a shotgun or something. It didn't work. I pinched myself to see if it hurt. It did. I was awake. I finally got the courage to look up at the corner of the room. Sat upright again, the figure had it's gaze fixed on me as it's wirey fingers played out their little melody. It's face was the same pale shade, with the same dark eyes, but this time it's smile was even more gaping and twisted. It’s teeth glimmered in the dark, they looked sharp and coated in a dark liquid. That fucking smile, it’s nothing I’ve ever seen before. It’s fingers looked pointed and rough as they more and more frantically scratched at my walls. I wanted to scream, to get my flatmates to come in and help me, but I didn't want them to think I was insane. What if it really was just my bipolar? What if I was in some sort of psychosis? They were decent people, but we hadn't known each other very long, and I wasn't comfortable sharing my mental health issues with them. I didn't want them to think I was insane. So, I bargained with myself that I would just turn the lamp on, and if it was still there, that was reasonable cause to shout to them for help. It wouldn't prove its not a hallucination, but it would probably mean I'm so far gone that I need serious help anyway.

So, trying not to look away this time in fear of it getting closer, I switched on my lamp. 

Gone. 

“What the actual fuck. I'm going fucking insane”, I cried to myself. I decided that first thing in the morning, I would arrange an appointment with my doctor and get some antipsychotics or some shit. But there was no way in hell I was sleeping that night, I didn't care that it was all in my head, that shit was way too scary for me to go through again. I went to go make some coffee, when I saw my flatmate in the kitchen, looking mildly infuriated and groggy whilst pouring a glass of water.

""Uh, hey Lexi"", I said, wondering what she was doing up at 3:30am.

""Hey, what was all that scratching about in your room? Are you like... cleaning or something?"".

My heart skipped a fucking beat. If she heard scratching too…

I ran back into my bedroom, I needed to see if there was any evidence to prove once and for all that this was not all in my head, that this fucking demon existed and wasn’t a product of my messed up brain chemistry. I looked at the corner of the room properly, with the main light turned on this time, and I could see scratch marks across the walls.

I haven't spoken to Lexi, or any of my flatmates. I haven't slept. I haven't turned the light off. But if I'm being totally honest, I don't think keeping the light on will prevent it from coming back. It already developed from a small glance in the corner of my eye, to a full figure I can stare at face to face - as if it was getting stronger and stronger, so I expect it will be strong enough to appear in the light soon. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've caught a few glimpses in my peripheral vision already. I don’t know what it is or what it wants, but I expect I’ll find out soon. One way or another. ",1,1741396147.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Timmies is extremely popular.  I enjoy going there, as do many people I know. The people I know that don't like Timmies just go somewhere else that they do like. A perfectly reasonable thing to do.

But what possible reason would you have to use any of your precious time to come here and complain about a coffee shop you don't like?  Just go somewhere you do like.

There simply has to be something better to do in your life than hanging around online to complain about a coffee shop you don't like ... over and over and over again.  It's just a coffee shop, people.

1: She is literal. 
When Millie asks if she wouldn't put boogers in her boss's coffee, Yor says she didn't know it made it tastier. 

2: Hyperfocus on sharp objects.
She shows a great interest in sharp objects to the point of tare the object 

3: She is seen as weird and naive. 
Her coworkers think she's strange and Yuri thinks she's naive. And many autistic people are seen like this. 

4: She has terrible communication. 
She communicates so badly to the point that people believe she forgot to tell them that she was married for 1 year. 

Well, I'm autistic and I identify a lot with the character, but I understand that you see it differently than me.

1j65cu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1j65cu4/help_me_identify_issues_with_relatively_freshly/,Help me identify issues with (relatively freshly roasted) Brandywine coffee,"For some background, I am a couple years into my pourover journey. Really focusing more seriously/consistently in the last few months.

My equipment setup is as follows:

Plastic V60
Fellow Stagg EKG Pro Studio
Breville Smart Grinder Pro (i know this is where my equipment is most lacking)

I am from right outside of Memphis and have spent the bulk of my specialty coffee journey brewing Onyx exclusively. Have typically been able to dial them in and achieve what i would call 80% cups (as Lance Hedrick talks about). I am sure a grinder upgrade would improve the consistency and probably provide a lot of additional clarity.

I have kept my eye on what y'all are drinking in the way of reliable specialty coffees. One that's always caught my attention is Brandywine. So, recently i bought their sample box to see what all the fuss was about. I am now into bag 3 of 5 and one thing that is consistent is a disappointing cup.

Now, i brewed the first on day 3 or 4 after roast but i am now on day 7 and i just am consistently getting cups that i would describe as hollow, muted/underwhelming nose and palate compared to what im used to with onyx, perhaps a little smokey/roasty quality in the back of my throat. These are always difficult notes to diagnose as under or overextracted imo.

My total drain time is in the 2:15-2:30 mark on a 15g:250g brew, which is what i would expect should get me in the ballpark telling me i shouldn't be messing with grind size too much.

Of the factors i could potentially play with, would you recommend water temp (I've been between 203 and 205), agitation more or less (I've done most using Lance Hedrick 2 pour method but a more traditional 4:6 seems to give me the same result), or do you think the beans simply need more time? I have so far brewed a Guatemalan Natural, the Orbital Magic Blend, and now the Kenya Nyeri Peaberry (which may have been the most aromatic bean I've ever smelled pre and post grind but left a very lacking nose and palate after brew).

I wasn’t ready to trust a girl just yet. But I said fuck it! and gave her full trust because she seemed truthful and she was completely honest from first meeting. 
She was straight up about still working with her ex of 8 years. And honest about having a guy friend that used you give her horse shoes on. I quickly met her ex and felt completely save about them. He seemed super respectful and there was no weird vibes between them. Usually when she was on her way home 1hr drive. she called this other guy. And then she would come home still on the phone with him laughing and then whispering into the phone I’m home. Yeah his looking at me now. I should go. And then she would say “ poor this guys his so sexuality frustrated” and he’s girlfriend is such a bitch for treating him like that. And I heard it again and again. And I told her I would like to meet him. And she would say ofc. And then when asked what he said. She would say it didn’t come up. Or his busy. And then I
Told her I’m uncomfortable with her talking about sex with another man. Especially when o haven’t even got to meet him and she acts like she’s under attack when ever I ask about meeting him. And then after some months of this. I’m off early so I call home and tell her I’m home In 10 min. And she says our common female friend is there and so is this guy. So I say great then I can finally meet him. I get home and his gone. He brought them coffee and they all only drank half. Then she gives me an excuse that he’s sorry but he had to go and was busy. I get tell her that’s bull shit. But I let it go. Then some weeks
After I
Call home and ask her what’s up. she says not
Much.
Then I say I home early, and there in 5 min. 
She Says she has to go. And I get home and she’s doing the dishes. I thought it was weird becouse she cut me off because she was busy.
Later that day we were making dinner and she asked me
To put music on from her phone. Then I say her text. She texted that guy and said thank you for today. 3 days after she admitted he stopped by.
Gave me the excuse that she forgot. And
That’s why she didn’t tell me. 
I know she didn’t tell me
On purpose becouse of how I would react. Is there any chance that she didn’t tell me about him being there becouse they are actually just friends?

MAJOR SPOILERS FOR EVERY PIECE OF SUPER PAPER MARIO LORE 

Mimi is heavily implied by *Carson* of The Overthere Coffee Bar in Flopside. Pay him ten coins and he tells you a story. There are two about Mimi, one where he explains that Mimi is likely a failed Pixl created by the Ancients. Another story implies she is the unintended result of a witches experiment with shape-shifting potion's. 

Let's assume both are true. she was a failed Pixl who was abandoned and then experimented on by a witch and that is how we have the Mimi we have today. This explains why she is seemingly mechanical when viewing her spider-form from 3D. 

Shadoo is the final boss of the Pit of 100 Trials in Flopside. She is heavily implies to be the Pixl Queen. The Pixl Queen started a Pixl uprising rebelling against their masters that was so devastating it made the Ancients loose their way of life, many, MANY, pixls to loose their life, and caused the ancients to stop making Pixls entirely (merlon being the sole exception). We can assume that Pixls were treated poorly, abused, and not loved. We can assume Mimi may have had similar experiences.   

Mimi's chapter revolves around greed and consumption. She wants a mansion, she wants Rupees, and according to her diary she wants a gem-filled pool with Hunky Lifeguards. 

I believe Mimi lives a life without love, and in such learned to only love materialistic things for the stability and control it gives her, this is why her life revolves around it. She lived a life without love and it damaged her, causing her to present herself as shallow and materialistic because she is hiding her true self and her true pain... just like Bleck

Mimi's chapter is Chapter 2, right at the beginning of the game. Every other chapter in Super Paper Mario revolves around love in some way. In order (skipping chapter 2) we have, Love of your ancestors working for a better future for there decedents, love of friends doing anything they can to help one another, love of a mother and child, separated in time and death, love of a nation and how it can bring people together and how love means sacrifice, Love as a tragedy, and love of a family transcending simple bloodlines, and finally love as redemption, hope, and something that can overcome all evil. 

Now lets look at chapter 2, what does chapter two have? Love of money? Love of Greed? Love of power? Thematically Chapter 2 doesn't fit in with the rest of the chapters. And that's the point. Chapter 2 is a micro-showing of who Bleck is, a man without love, and we see that within his minion Mimi.

Mimi is without love and compensates for that, just like how Bleck does. Mimi is a demonstration of someone experiencing pain and dealing with it in destructive ways the same way Bleck is.

1j6578j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j6578j/rattler/,Rattler,"When you come from a small town, the world itself feels equally small. You sort of imagine the world as a series of little towns, interconnected by little roads. Your sense of scale is off until you leave your comfort zone and step out of your home. It’s when you start chasing the horizon that you realize just how far it really stretches.

That’s what it was like for me growing up in the Czech Republic. I come from a small community near Litvinov. Growing up there, all you heard people talk about was what they were going to do when they “really” started living. The places they’d go, the sights they’d see, the opportunities they’d grasp. There was the usual bravado, like the guys telling me they’d have a dozen girlfriends the second they got to Prague. Others just talked about what cars they’d like to have.

But then there were those of us who just wanted an honest shot in life. Those of us who wanted to create something bigger than ourselves.

And to do that, we had to follow the roads, and not look back.

 

I studied in Prague, and one semester in Germany for an exchange program. By the time I graduated, I had a junior position at a small telecom company. It kept me going while I worked on my master’s degree. A lot of late nights working effectively 10–13-hour days, making do with almost nothing but an apartment that can generously be described as a closet.

But I pulled through. I got a degree in optoelectronics, with a focus on fiber optic communications. I was picked up by a company working with hospital equipment and almost tripled my salary overnight.

That single point in my life made my world wide open. I could suddenly travel the world, and take expensive vacations. I could wear suits. I could wear a shirt and tie to work without looking pretentious. I was taking a clear and conscious step up in the world, and the view was *spectacular*. Pretty damn far from having cigarettes with my friends after a quick meal at Sokolovna.

 

I got promoted to team lead in 2008 and was made project lead in 2013. I got married and had two beautiful children. Life slowly settled into a comfortable hum, where I could want for nothing, and I could step into the unknown with confidence. An expert in my field, and someone others could look up to.

But things took a turn in the autumn of 2014. One of the company’s investors stepped up to gain a majority share and immediately turned things around. Not with layoffs or savings, but in a new direction. We were to gradually step away from medical hardware and move into informatics and communication. With a partner name like ‘Hatchet’, we were expecting cuts, but these people were all about expansion.

We got a new name, logo, and some people were added to the company board. Locals, mostly, but one or two Americans would fly in a couple of times per year for project updates. It wasn’t an instantaneous change, but we got reassigned to other projects. The pay got better though. I was already way above average, but this kicked it to a whole new level. We also got an extra vacation week in July, so they didn’t get a lot of pushback.

 

I worked with Hatchet for a number of small projects over the years. Mostly related to their early advances in AI, but also more experimental projects. Imaging systems that could be used in the dark, remotely charged static electronics, all kinds of weird and imaginative experiments. Most of it could be frustrating, but it was incredibly interesting. Some of the most engaging work I’ve ever had.

I was eventually assigned to a project lovingly called “Polednice”. I think they called it that because they thought it’d drive us mad someday. It was meant to be a far-fetched “maybe it can’t be done” kind of project with an impossible goal. It was meant to be a surveillance system where we could identify a person to a high degree of accuracy without using blood, DNA, or facial recognition. That was the pitch.

We experimented a bit with phone tracking software, but that wasn’t accurate enough; phones could be switched or exchanged. We needed something that tracked the *person*, not their hardware. But it couldn’t be invasive.

 

It was one of the senior technicians that came up with the idea for the first draft of our system. Bohdan was a goddamn genius. The guy learned to code as a teenager by having a Java handbook in his bathroom, and he wrote his first program on a plastic sheet with a sharpie. This guy lived and breathed code. His idea was simple; what if we could scan people, instead of their phones. Kind of like a sonar, or echolocation.

The idea was basically to tweak the signals to allow for an echo, or a ping. This, in turn, would be translated into an image, which could be used to identify a person. It was a long shot, but that was the whole point of our project; to chase long shots, and to make daring assumptions. We threw things at the wall to see what’d stick, and the management loved it. We got the full go-ahead for our first prototype in autumn 2016.

We ran into a lot of problems, as could be expected. Not only in the hardware itself, but in latency, disruptions, and a dozen other things. The slightest drop of rain could send the system crashing down, and the best we could get at first was a vague white blob on a screen. You couldn’t identify anyone from that.

 

But over the course of a few years, technology improved. Better coverage, better signal tuning, better hardware. We managed to compensate for atmospheric interruption and poor signal coverage. Latency became a non-issue. The white blob turned into a vague humanoid, which presented another challenge.

We couldn’t get the signal to properly resonate with the appearance of a person. We couldn’t compensate for clothing, skin color, eye color… hell, we kept getting problems with fingernails showing up as flashes of white on the screen. It was just one problem after another. It was bad enough that it ground the project to a complete stop for months, until a woman named Jitka came up with an idea.

“Let’s just crank it up,” she said. “Go past the clothes. Check the bones.”

“Why would we do that?” I asked.

“Bones have identifiers,” she continued. “Cranial structure. Density. Shape. Vertebrae, dental records, damage, patterns, wear… it’s like a fingerprint.”

So we tried it. We cranked it up, and we tried a bone scan. Something beneath the immediate surface.

 

I’ll never forget that moment. Our entire team leaning over a screen as the image rendered. Suddenly, a hum, followed by a crystal-clear image of Bohdan’s skeleton as he returned from the bathroom. People were hugging and cheering like we’d landed on the moon. I think Jitka actually kissed Bohdan.

 This changed the scope of our project from “maybe it can’t be done” to “we got something to show”. It was incredibly exciting, and we got an immediate 30% bump to our project financing. We brought in an osteopathic doctor from Spain, a senior hardware engineer, and a telecom specialist. We were no longer working on the Polednice; this was the osteohaptic signal imager system. Or as we lovingly called it, the Rattler.

See, the reason this works so well is that the skeleton effectively “rattles” as the waves pass through at just the right frequency. It’s like a wind chime. Whoever gets scanned suffers no adverse effects, but on repeated exposure they might experience a mild sensation. It passes quickly and feels no stranger than a sense of déjà vu. A couple of people exposed to it during sleep described it as a bump in the night.

 

We built up a library of skeleton identifiers, using data from various European universities. We collected pretty much everything and used programs to standardize it into comparable data points. At first it allowed us to make vague descriptions of a person. Male, 50’s, club foot. That kind of thing. But over time we could get more and more specific. Female, 25 years old, northern Scandinavian.

In the summer of 2021, we could map out 21 identifiers with a 75-95% accuracy. As long as we knew what to look for, description-wise, we could find them. The only problem was our hardware constraints; we couldn’t do large amounts of scans in massive areas; we had to know in advance where to look.

That changed in autumn 2021. We were to give a demonstration for our lead investor, and if successful, we’d expand the range of the system tenfold.

 

We used a couple of presets to reliably show the data of five sample people that we’d collected. We showed the process and the reliability of the scans in real time, explaining as we went exactly what they were looking at. It was impressive, but for someone without the know-how, all they had was a name on the screen. That is, until I took the presentation off the rails.

“Do you have a wife?” I asked.

“I do,” they answered.

“I suppose you brought them along,” I said. “It’s nice to travel together, yes?”

“I did, yes.”

“With your permission, would you mind me showing you where she is?”

 

He was hesitant, but agreed. He listed off identifiers, and we pointed the system in a general direction. We excluded certain places and limited the scope of the scan to about three blocks in downtown Prague. As the system listed off and excluded signals that couldn’t match the identifiers, more and more candidates popped up. I asked a few follow-up questions, like if she had any broken bones or titanium screws, which excluded a couple more.

Finally, we got a perfect match. I gave him an address and asked him to call her to confirm.

“And ask her to try the fruit dumplings,” I smiled. “They’re excellent.”

He called her. A couple of intense seconds later, he confirmed it. She was at a café downtown, just like the Rattler predicted, and she hadn’t felt a thing.

The lead investor was *floored*.

 

Things exploded into action. We got in touch with the government through a high-end contact, and we got to pull the curtain back on the infrastructure we’d been passively (and somewhat illegally) working with. We didn’t just get a stamp of approval; everyone wanted a piece of the pie. Especially law enforcement applications, and government intelligence. This was exactly what Hatchet wanted; a tool they could rent out in secret for a perk no one even knew existed. They’d be *bathing* in money.

The Rattler got more accurate as our infrastructure improved. Our range expanded from a couple blocks to about ten square kilometers. We had people knocking on our doors begging for us to let them hand us data. Family history, criminal records, forensic data; we fed everything into that machine. We had to put up a queue system for those freely handing us classified medical information on a government level.

And in return, the Rattler was put into practice. Not only did we start to locate people, but we started gathering data on pretty much everyone. We could do a ping on thousands of people and see straight into their bones, and all they’d feel was a bump in the night. And we’d know everything.

 

We worked in tandem with Hatchet and the government. We had two teams; a development team, and a batch team. The batch team worked with scan orders and confirmations that dropped in from our clients, while the development team worked to increase efficiency, accuracy, and better components. The system was still, by and large, held together by duct tape and dreams. But that also meant that we couldn’t easily replicate it, and that our team wasn’t replaceable. Both Bohdan and Jitka were still on the project, but had gotten cushier positions over time.

It did feel a bit strange working so hush-hush, but there is a long history of distrusting surveillance systems in this country. Any hint of government overreach in this manner might send people screaming into the streets, and we didn’t want to bring any unwanted attention. So it was all “experimental” and “exploratory ventures”.

 

It was autumn 2023. The rain wouldn’t stop, and the distant thunder kept me awake. I could almost smell the ozone from a nearby lightning strike. I woke up two seconds before my phone rang. It was one of our government contacts calling me at 5 in the morning.

“We need an order pushed through. Now,” she huffed. “Your technicians refuse to comply.”

“Then there must be a reason.”

“They say it’s not possible,” she continued. “That you can’t collect enough data. You got no identifiers.”

“Then we can’t do anything until you get it,” I explained. “You know the requirements.”

“This is life or death!” she spat back. “And if you’re as clever as your job title assumes, you damn well help me pick life on this.”

 

By the time I got to the office, there was a crowd gathering. Police officers, government officials, senior hardware technicians. My government contact, a woman named Kristina, pulled me aside to explain the situation. There was a suspected serial killer about to leave the country. This person, nicknamed Jezevec, had a partner that was about to smuggle them out of the EU. It was a cat-and-mouse game that pointed to one thing; they were leaving by train, today.

The problem was, we didn’t know a lot about Jezevec, and our system required identifiers to find them. So we were at an impasse; we knew what train stations to observe, but we didn’t know enough about the target to find them. We could scan those people over and over, but without knowing what to look for, we’d be blind.

“So that covers what we *don’t* know,” I said. “Do we have any kind of applicable info?”

“Not much,” Kristina sighed. “We know an old woman they’re related to. She was the first victim. But we know little to nothing about them. Jezevec could be young, old… anything.”

That gave me an idea.

 

Kristina handed me all information she had about the old woman. We turned our attention to her burial site and scanned the remains for genetic identifiers. That, in turn, could be used to ping for similarities. I forwarded this to the technicians, who began to filter out irrelevant data. But there was another problem; scope.

We were dealing with thousands of potential targets in four separate locations, all to be scanned within a fraction of the time we usually needed. This could take hours, but we had to boil it down to minutes. So we tore our hair out, and Jitka elbowed her way in to solve the problem.

“Just crank it up,” she said. “It’s harmless. We’ve checked over and over. We are ten times lower than potential risk factors, and even then, it’s only something to be worried about when considering long-term exposure.”

Of course, she was right. We’d interrupt cell phone traffic, but we got the green light immediately.

 

For those traveling through Prague by train that day, many didn’t notice the Rattler coming online. A couple of people got goosebumps, a few calls disconnected. Some people might have noticed the hair on their necks stand up. Some might have wandered into a room only to forget what they were about to do. It was minor inconveniences, at worst.

As we honed in on our target, using the identifiers from the first victim, we got a couple of matches. Bohdan waved at me from across the room, looking worried.

“Backlogs,” he mentioned. “We got backlogs.”

I didn’t understand what he was talking about, so I hushed him. So did everyone else. The system was clearly overloaded, backlogs were to be expected.

 

Finally, we got a match. 91% accuracy, a single target. The second potential target was, at best, 60% accurate. People were yelling over one another, and they pulled up a camera feed from the train station on the break room TV. Kristina pointed excitedly as the order was given to snatch them off the platform.

“We got them,” she smiled. “Jezevec. Finally.”

We got a clear view of the target from an overhead camera. A bald man in his mid-40’s with distinctive ears. Deep dark eyes, and a taped-on plastic smile. He’d be hard to pick out of a lineup. He could walk into a crowd and disappear, but now we had him. But Bohdan seemed less confident. He came up to me and pulled me aside as Kristina relayed the information to a field team.

“This is a bad idea,” Bohdan said. “We’re focusing too much on too little.”

“We’re not even at quarter capacity,” I sighed. “How is that too much?”

“Yes, but you’re focusing it all on one person,” he continued. “This level is supposed to be used for data gathering, this configuration aimed at one single person can be-“

 

He stopped as something in the room shifted. Something changed. A single person tilted their head curiously.

We all saw something on the camera feed. Jezevec, waiting for his train, suddenly shivered. I looked back at our order screens running in the batch room, and it was just red warnings running over and over and over on repeat. The backlogs were coming through, bursting through the system like a built-up dam of scan orders.

See, it is one thing for a person to be scanned once every few hours or so. That’s harmless. But this was *a single person* being homed in on from ten different sources at once, to a multiplier of a thousand. It was such a massive level of targeting that the scans themselves were doing something we’d never anticipated. This thing was made to rattle, and that’s what it did. It rattled.

Medically speaking, the vibrations were so intense that they effectively serrated and broke the fat, blood vessels, and muscles connected to the bone; causing air pockets to build and burst. And we saw it live on a muted surveillance camera.

 

The target collapsed to the ground. Their facial tissue hung loose, causing their expression to loosen like they were melting into the ground. Muscles twitched and died as they were severed, sending limbs into bouts of inhuman contortion and tissue death. I could see the eyes turn bloodshot even on a black and white screen. I could see all the way into Jezevecs’ wide-open mouth as their tongue turned purple and the skin retracted from their teeth.

People in the crowd were live streaming it from the platform. Someone in the room was playing it. I heard this animal heaving noise, like a horse trying to gargle. I could hear bones snap out of place as nerves twisted and turned, bending the body to an unrecognizable pile. It looked like their spine was trying to swallow itself, only to choke on their navy-blue hoodie.

“Skin!” Jezevec cried. “Skin! Skin!”

But those words turned to cries, and those cries turned to mewling nothings. By the time the police arrived, Jezevec was already dead.

 

We all just stood there for a moment. None of us had considered this as even a slight possibility. Even Bohdan, who had suspected something might happen, couldn’t believe it. It was beyond the worst, most unimaginable nightmare. I think Jitka left to throw up in the bathroom. I broke the silence.

“Shut everything down,” I demanded. “Shut it down, and we’ll talk tomorrow.”

Kristina gave me a protesting look, but I shook my head. This was non-negotiable. We were pulling the plug and taking a day to process this.

 

I don’t think this was on the news. No one knew that this person was Jezevec, and to onlookers it looked like an awful seizure of some kind. Having police on the scene was mistaken for someone trying to help. I’m sure it was mentioned here and there, and I’m sure the video still circulates online. But there were no cries from parliament about trying us for manslaughter. There were no protests in the streets. The Rattler was still our dirty little secret, and we were just starting to see how dirty it could get.

I barely slept that night. I kept hearing those distorted screams, played through a phone speaker in the back of my mind. Skin. Was that the last thing he’d felt? His skin? My stomach hurt just thinking about it. And when I finally closed my eyes and felt that bump in the night, my eyes shot wide open. Was it an actual bump in the night, or was the system still running?

What if that thing got in the wrong hands? Hell, what if it got into *any* hands?

 

There were a lot of opinions at the morning meeting the next day. Some wanted to shut it down completely. Others talked about safeguards. Problem was, the cat was out of the bag. Even if we patched things up, it could be undone. It’s like finding out your phone can be used as a gun. Sure, you might keep the lock on, but you’ll stop putting it up to your ear to talk.

“I say we purge it,” Bohdan said. “Shut the whole thing down. Trash the servers. Scorched earth.”

“We’ll be prosecuted,” Jitka sighed. “Destruction of company property, at best.”

“So?” Bohdan sneered. “Don’t you realize the scope of this thing?”

“There are a hundred backups in a dozen locations,” I said. “It would require a calculated attack on all backups, simultaneously, coordinated with a dozen technicians. Even if we could, we have to-“

Before I could finish my thought, there was a beep. I turned to the batch room.

 

Turns out, the system was never really shut down.

See, it does this thing when it processes reports that it runs a background loop archiving and integrating everything. Basically, it takes data and melts it into the code; sort of like an information soup. But we had gotten hundreds of thousands of logs on that one person entered into the system. Jezevec had been more thoroughly scanned than any other person in recorded history.

The information we’d gathered was *massive*. We could see not only the bones, but the surrounding musculature. We could see the way the body contorted frame by frame from every possible angle, and the excruciating snap of every ligament and nerve. The system had kept running in standby, boiling all this information down to the background algorithm, connecting it to data points, criminal records, forensic data, medical records, family history, and a dozen other connected channels.

Jezevec had, overnight, utilized the full capacity of the Rattler to be broken down, scanned, and inserted into the system on a microscopic level. And that final beep, turning the light green, showed us that the system was finished with its calculations.

 

We didn’t understand what we were looking at. This wasn’t just a matter of compiling data, this was essentially translating a physical person into code. We’d been getting warnings from our server banks all night, but the system was programmed to recompile itself and try again. This was a system that was made to run in the background for months on end, and it had gained *so much information* about this *one man* that we almost went over capacity in a single night.

Bohdan just shook his head, trying to comprehend the scale of it.

“I say we burn it,” he said. “This thing’s gonna need a fucking exorcism.”

 

I tried to be diplomatic, but Bohdan was right. We had to install a kill switch, and we needed it yesterday. I got the go-ahead to cancel our service extension to three major eastern metropolitan areas, and I told the lead investor that we were putting it all into maintenance mode pending investigation and review. There were no protests. Jitka called our boss, who in turn promised to check with the off-site technicians about bringing the backups and the archive down.

It was rough and rude, but it was necessary. But all through the day, whenever I got a shiver or shake, I could feel my heart skip a beat. My life could be turned inside out at the flick of a button, and we didn’t have enough safeguards to make sure it didn’t. It was like we were working with a live bomb in the next room, and we were figuring out which cables to cut.

We worked late into the night. Bohdan was putting in what checks and balances he could, while Jitka was coordinating the shutdown with our technicians; figuring out what to keep, and what not. I was trying to calm our investors and overseas partners, but it was futile – they just saw dollar signs being flushed down the toilet.

Somewhere around midnight, I felt a chill going up my back. That was my last straw. It might have been nothing, but on the miniscule chance that it wasn’t, I took action. I called my wife and asked her to take a morning train to her sister in Linz south of the border.

 

I slept on the couch in the break room, answering calls all night long. When I finally opened my eyes after a solid three-hour sleep, the morning sun had broken through the curtains. We’d done what we could. I lumbered over to Bohdan. He was in his late 30’s, but had reverted to a caffeine-chugging teenager to get through the night. I think the stress of things had nicked a couple more hairs from his balding head.

The screen kept flashing with white text on a black console window. Repeating patterns and commands, errors and missing files. And a couple of lines that kept repeating.

“I don’t know why it’s doing that,” Bohdan said, pointing to the screen. “See that?”

I looked a bit closer. A repeated command line.

“It does something, but I don’t know what,” he continued. “No errors flare up, but the process deletes itself when you interact. Then it returns. Like something peeks out, then runs away.”

And the line kept repeating. Pattern-less. Random.

SKIN. SKIN. SKIN.

 

Jitka and I had a coffee, looking over the diagnostics. We could see some background services still running, but that was all above board. Nothing we didn’t recognize. But Bohdan wasn’t convinced. He couldn’t look away from those repeating lines.

“Looks like the towers are disconnecting,” Jitka added. “That’s good.”

“It’s at very low capacity,” Bohdan sighed. “But it’s not harmless.”

“At least it’s under control.”

Then Jitka dropped her coffee cup. It shattered, spilling black coffee across the floor. Her hand was shaking.

“Sorry,” she said. “Nerves.”

 

We camped out in the office, waiting for the system to go offline. More and more sections were disconnecting, and I could see the weight on Bohdan’s shoulders melt away. He crashed in the break room, curling up in a fetal position on the company couch. There was a white post-it on the screen, simply reading;

“Wake me up if we’re about to die.”

I felt like I was on guard duty, making sure the screens didn’t misbehave. Every hour or so, we got a compiler notice, telling us something had been updated. This was a good thing; it meant something was different on a hardware level. Like when something was disconnected or destroyed. But something was different.

It was just after 6 pm. Bohdan was in a half-woken coma, and Jitka was playing games on her phone. The compiler message came in; but then it came in again. Over, and over, and over. I waved Bohdan over.

 

“That makes no sense,” he laughed. “No, yeah, no. I don’t like that.”

He sat down next to me and took a closer look. Finally, he pulled up the logs, pointing at a particular line.

“Is this a name change?” he asked. “What is this?”

“I didn’t touch it,” I said.

“Wait a minute…”

Looking a little closer, he checked the command logs. The moment he had stepped away from the computer, something had internally changed the prompt names. The compiler message no longer signaled something disconnecting, it signaled an extra call of an unknown process.

“That means we haven’t got an update in… nine hours,” said Bohdan. “Why is that? Wasn’t it brought offline?”

Jitka peeked her head in.

“I can’t get a hold of the boss,” she said. “No one’s answering.”

 

I got in my car, and headed for the main office downtown. I got on a conference call with Jitka and Bohdan to keep updated. We couldn’t reach anyone. The service technicians, our boss, no one working on the Rattler. Hell, I couldn’t even reach Kristina, our government contact.

I rushed to the main office, went through the checkpoints, and hurried up the stairs. As I did, my fingers cramped up, leaving me stuck with my hand on the railing.

“What’s wrong?” I heard Bohdan say. “You alright?”

My hand released, but my pulse was higher. I took a moment to collect myself. I reflected; was this a sense of déjà vu, or was it just a matter of being sleep deprived? I stammered out the only thought I could muster.

“I don’t know.”

 

People had gone home for the day, but there had to be someone around since the alarms hadn’t been set. It was usually whoever left last who engaged them. I looked around but couldn’t see anyone. Just empty work rooms and half-lit cubicles. That, and the ever-present Hatchet logo, underlined by their signature blue sunflower.

Then I heard interference. A little crackle in the conference call.

“Bohdan?” I said. “Can you hear me?”

There was a response, but I couldn’t make out the words. Then the call dropped.

 

I stepped into the top floor conference room, only to see a projector still running. There was a laptop there with some kind of presentation material. Apparently, my boss had been rehearsing for some kind of business meeting. Probably a crisis resolution team to deal with the Rattler going offline.

Then I heard something. A shuffle.

Looking a little closer, I could see one of the chairs being tilted. I rounded the table, but stopped myself. I didn’t know what I might see, and I didn’t know if I wanted to know. I considered turning around and just walking out of there. I could be on a train to Linz and gone before anyone cared to notice.

But first, I had to check.

 

I didn’t recognize my boss at first. A man in his early 60’s, wearing a white shirt with a red tie. Curled up under the table like a dead insect trying to shield itself from the sun. Every finger pointing in different directions, like branches on a misgrown tree. Something in his eyes had broken loose, causing a slight gap between his socket and eyelid, as a streak of tears and blood still dripped.

He was still as the grave, and more dead than any man I’d ever seen.

 

I couldn’t breathe. Was it the panic, or was it something else? I tried to stay calm, to stay rational. I tried to analyze my feelings, to see if I was experiencing distress, or a rattle. But I couldn’t.

I fell over and crawled, pushing myself back up against the wall – but I couldn’t look away. It looked so unreal, like a broken doll. I couldn’t stop imagining him suddenly bursting into action. My hand cramped again, as the interference from my phone crackled to life. My pulse rose as my cheeks felt warm. A bead of sweat stung my eye. A slight cramp in my foot.

Then, it stopped.

And the dead man moved.

 

It was just a slight twitch of the throat. Something rattling to life, using flesh like a marionette. Vibrations making his throat squirm, as the final breath in his lungs took shape. A voice as cold and remorseless as the void of space.

***“My skin as blameless…”***

His index finger cracked and turned to the side, like an earth worm reaching for the rain.

***“…as blameless, as hands divine…”***

Two hands slammed into the fitted office carpet, blood mixing with the muted corporate red. Fingers curling every which way, as the corpse pulled itself an inch closer.

***“…hands divine…”***

A fingernail casually falling to the floor, as aimless eyes turned every which way.

***“…divine…”***

 

I scrambled to my feet, sprinting out the door. Not the door I came from, but the one across from me; whatever was furthest away from this. All of this. Anything.

My phone had burned out, leaving a smoking hole in the battery. Picking it up, I burned myself, and dropped it, only to have it land in a puddle of blood.

Looking up, I realized there were other victims. At least eight people. All contorted into a pile in the middle of the corridor, reaching all the way to the ceiling. I couldn’t tell where one began and one ended. Torn clothes. Bones peering through open wounds. Blood as black as oil, settling into the sole of my shoes.

And the smell. It was this powerful chemical, like ammonia and chlorine, with that faint glow of iron settling in my lungs.

 

I panicked. I turned around and headed for the fire exit. The doors were electronically locked, and my pass wasn’t working. I could hear noises coming down the hall. A deep growling, where a word is drawn out to the point it becomes a cry.

I had to force myself through the door with a fire axe. I almost threw myself off the fire escape. My hands were shaking so much that I almost slipped while reaching for the railing, but I kept going. I made it down to street level and ran for my car.

The moment I got in the driver’s seat I had it call Jitka and Bohdan.

There was no answer.

 

Getting back to the others, I found myself standing outside our main door. I didn’t know what to expect. Or rather, I didn’t want to know. I tried not to imagine them broken and disfigured, but I couldn’t stop myself. Death could be waiting at the other side of the door, but I still tried my pass card. It worked.

Bohdan was on the floor. He wasn’t dead and contorted, but he looked unconscious. Jitka was sitting on one of the conference chairs, leaning against the wall, clutching her legs. I stepped inside, looking over at the batch room. The screens were flashing white, still.

“It killed the service technicians hours ago,” she whispered. “They never brought it offline.”

“False reports,” I whispered back. “It’s fed us what we want to see.”

“It’s him,” Jitka continued. “It’s the man. The one the police wanted.”

“What about the-“

“It’s got everyone,” she interrupted. “Even the lead investor.”

“Wasn’t… wasn’t he in Greece?”

Jitka nodded. Apparently, someone had illegally connected the Rattler to an extended network. A far extended network. And they’d done so in the last few hours, unhindered.

 

We couldn’t shut it down anymore. We were, effectively, at its mercy. And with every beat of my heart, I didn’t know what to expect. Step by step I approached the batch room, and the many workstations. Command lines had turned to rambling, spouting apocalyptic nonsense.

I could feel my eyes water, and I stopped. Jitka was already on her feet, as if ready to pull me back. This is probably what had happened to Bohdan; he’d been too forward, and it had struck him down – but not killed him. There had to be a reason for that.

“It needs us,” I muttered. “*You* need us.”

 

The screens stopped, for half a second, then resumed. It was listening. A ghost in the machine – the imprint of a serial killer melded into the core programming of our system.

“You need something from us,” I said. “And- and we need something from you.”

Jitka screamed as her hand suddenly snapped. It was just a sprain, but enough to send her sprawling to the floor, crying in pain.

“Just tell us what you want,” I said. “We can- can work something out.”

 

A single command line popped up on the screen, with a blinking square to indicate a need for action.

“run --allegiance”

I stepped into the room. The hairs on my arm stood up, and I had to blink away a sudden rush of blood going through my head. A sense of déjà vu. Goosebumps. Something electric, licking the details of my bones from afar.

“Is this it?” I asked.

A surge of warmth waded through me, and I looked out at Bohdan and Jitka. They were still alive.

I pressed the button, and we surrendered.

 

A total of sixteen people died that day. It was explained as freak accidents, medical issues, and a peculiar case of poisoning. Of course, those involved knew that wasn’t the case, but they didn’t care. They wanted it all swept under the rug, and they didn’t want anyone to ask any questions.

Our off-sites were never taken offline. The archive and backups were kept running. The system had, if anything, optimized itself and brute forced access to entirely new networks. It’s radio waves. It’s everywhere.

The Rattler has been kept online. At the start of this, it had the capacity to kill maybe… 10 or 20 people a minute. With the extension it has forced us to complete, that number is a dream compared to what it can do today.

 

Jitka, Bohdan and I are the last people that fully understand the Rattler, and what it does. People who have come too close to the project have disappeared, and Hatchet has kept us in maintenance mode. The Rattler seems pleased just to extend its power and influence, but it doesn’t act on it. It’s like it is collecting for something greater.

It plays, sometimes. It picks a person it doesn’t like. Someone resembling an old victim, or has a similar sounding name. It gleefully destroys them, like a child plucking the wings off a butterfly. It records the data and reviews it, playing their deaths on endless loops; forever burned into its system.

It scans me every day, just to show that it’s still there. It wakes me up at night. It teases and toys with me, knowing just what and where to poke to send me spiraling into an anxious panic.

It loves it. It delights in it.

 

My wife came back from Linz. My children are growing, and I live a comfortable, well-paid life. And they know nothing. No one does. They’re just as safe here as anywhere else, really.

Looking back on my life, I’ve come a far way from that little town near Litvinov. A place where the world felt small and insignificant. But with the way things are heading, and with the scope of death that can be aligned at the flick of a switch, the world feels smaller than ever.

We live our lives as if nothing has happened. But when I look across the room at the desolate faces of Bohdan and Jitka, we all understand. And as the Rattler playfully plucks another victim apart on our break room screen, we’re not even allowed to look away.

 

Instead we wait. We pray.

And we don’t know who’ll be next.",9,1741395123.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1j6572c,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1j6572c/a_spontaneous_adventure_with_a_stranger/,A spontaneous adventure with a stranger,"
A month ago i heard the appartement block doorbell ring, it rang alot and im not one for visitors but it was getting annoying, so i got out of bed (I just came from taking an afternoon nap) and open up.

Its a random guy with a massive backpack (he came from hiking in the mountains) Im so confused because i dont see him belonging in this apartment, apparently my neighbours do airbnb i just didn’t know but my neighbours were out so i waited in the entrance area with him and we had awkward small talk.

Anyway as soon my neighbours got back the small talk wasnt too bad and i had plans with them to go to city center so i asked the guy if he wanted to come and he did, it wasn’t anything special but it wasnt an awkward time yk?

We get home at around ten pm, (in the car i took his number just incase something happened while he wandered around himself) im in my room and he texts me asking for paper and a pencil (he’s an architecture student, we both have that in common)

I go downstairs to him and give him what he wants and i really dont know why, but i asked him if he wanted to play uno and luckily he said yes so we just played and talked until around midnight.

I go back to my room and im super smiley, idk it all felt so comically romantic even though nothing happened 😭

Anyway next morning he texts me around 10am asking me if i want coffee and i do lol, so i said yeah but its crazy because i was making a list of things he can do in this city as he was texting me.

I go to his appartement for coffee then we decide that ill show him around my uni then walk to the beach (its 4km away but gosh it was a long trek lol) but the trek was amazing because we kinda bonded in a way, if that makes sense. 

Once we reach the beach we start nerding out over the rocks near the water😭 then we drew in the sand and made up stories to go with it.

It was amazing, I’ve never gone on an adventure like that and its crazy that with a stranger i had an amazing time.

Since the walk was really long we took a taxi back home, i needed to go for my classes that evening from 1900 to 2100. By the time i got home i was pretty tired but we agreed that we’d draw together.

After a shower i went downstairs to his place and we drew originally we only wanted to draw a few rocks we collected but after we picaso-fied those rocks on paper we did a bunch of random drawings on more paper and soon its 2am and we decide to listen to music not that it matters but on wired earphones, its kinda romantic because you have to be kinda close to the other.

It reaches a point where we no longer draw but my head is on his shoulder and his head is on mine and we are both crying to radiohead

I dont know why he cried, but i was crying because i felt like i unlocked a sixth sense…

Thats all i wanted to share, its been a month since that happened and i guess im kinda sad that i know i will never experience something like that again

-I wanted to attach a picture of the first drawing we did because i think its pretty cute, anyone interested can text me",2,1741395106.0,stories,0,1.0,False

**- Oliver -**

His game only ended when he heard the AI speaking. ""Level 15 completed.""

Oliver finally stopped moving. The environment around him was saturated with a fine mist due to the agility training. His heart was pounding, but his breathing remained controlled, a testament to his intense training.

As he exited the room, Oliver was met by a barrage of screams and murmurs from the recruits gathered outside.

""Level 15! Impossible, someone broke the record,"" exclaimed one of them, disbelief etched on his face.

""Damn it! I lost my bet,"" lamented another, shaking his head in frustration.

Katherine awaited him near the entrance, observing with a serene smile as the gazes of the other recruits grew increasingly skeptical. To those watching, it seemed as if he predicted the shots before they were even fired, dodging with an almost superhuman skill.

Oliver appeared to evade each bullet or ricochet before it even left the gun.

""Well done,"" praised Katherine as he approached. She had opted not to take the test; seeing the speed with which Oliver moved, she knew she might match him but wondered if she could surpass him.

What had been a few dozen people had now transformed into a crowd of hundreds, with more continuing to arrive, drawn by the news of the new record.

""I'm next,"" proclaimed a recruit, stepping forward decisively.

""I'll try in the other room,"" said another, hurrying so as not to be left behind.

The race to surpass Level 15 had begun. However, neither Oliver nor Katherine were interested anymore. The boy had used it merely to calm himself, and Katherine found it an interesting pastime.

Oliver seized the opportunity when they were disputing who would be next to blend into the crowd. With a discreet gesture, he approached Katherine and took her hand, leading her away from the crowd and avoiding being followed.

""Let's go up a bit,"" he whispered, indicating the stairs that led to the fourth floor.

They climbed quickly, leaving behind the noisy third floor. On the fourth floor, silence reigned. It was the area designated for evaluation rooms, which were empty and inaccessible at that moment. The soft lights created an almost serene environment, contrasting with the bustle of the levels below.

""I think we lost them,"" commented Oliver, glancing back.

""Seems like it,"" replied Katherine, smiling. ""Eventful night, isn't it?""

She let out a little laugh, and he couldn't help but join in.

They strolled along the empty corridor, allowing themselves a moment of tranquility. The large windows offered a panoramic view of the desert that stretched beyond the base. Distant mountains punctuated the horizon, their silhouettes outlined against the starry sky.

Oliver paused for a moment, admiring the starry sky. Glancing at his gauntlet, he realized it was already late at night. Time had passed without them noticing.

""Sorry, our walk ended up taking your whole evening,"" Oliver said, turning to Katherine with a slightly embarrassed smile.

She looked at him, her eyes reflecting the sparkle of the stars.

""Don't worry, it was quite pleasant,"" she replied, turning her gaze back to the panoramic view. ""I usually don't have much freedom to walk around like this, window-shop, or even make friends. It's always a game of who pulls the rug from under whom. Having these lighter moments is something rare for me.""

Oliver could see the genuine happiness she was feeling on her face. There was a softness in her expression, a temporary relief from the responsibilities she usually carried. He felt a pang of empathy, understanding a bit more about her world.

The two continued walking; the silence between them was comfortable, filled only by the soft sound of their footsteps echoing along the corridor. They found another staircase and began to descend, the lights adjusting automatically as they moved. They slowly returned to the second floor, where the dormitories were located.

Katherine stifled a discreet yawn, covering her mouth with her hand.

""Looks like sleep is coming,"" observed Oliver with a smile.

""I think so,"" she admitted. ""It was a long day.""

""I'm still going to take a look at the information I received on the gauntlet,"" he commented.

As they both reached their beds in the dormitory, Katherine wished, ""See you tomorrow. Good luck to us.""

\--

\--

Oliver woke abruptly to the shrill sound of the siren announcing the start of the day at Base 45. The dormitory's soft lights began to intensify gradually. Blinking his eyes to adjust to the increasing brightness, he raised his arm and consulted his holographic gauntlet. It was precisely seven o'clock sharp.

| Exams will begin in one hour

The boy sighed, dragging himself out of bed. He had stayed up late the previous night, immersed in data about the types of robots he would face and analyzing every detail of the combat arena. The information pulsed in his mind, mingling with the nervousness that was now beginning to manifest.

Between yawns, Oliver got up. The metallic floors of the lodging reflected the artificial light, and the distant murmur of other recruits preparing echoed through the corridors. Quickly, he donned the Academy uniform—the attire automatically adjusted to his body, adapting to his movements.

He met up with Katherine and Isabela in the corridor. Isabela seemed a bit sleepy; she had arrived later after meeting with Astrid. The three of them made their way to the first floor, where the main cafeteria was situated.

Upon arriving, they were greeted by an effervescent environment. The first floor was packed, a sea of recruits from different colonies and academies, all immersed in their own worlds. Advertising holograms floated above, displaying ads for military equipment and motivational messages from the NEA.

The various shops offered an abundance of gastronomic options, from exotic dishes from distant planets to traditional Earth meals. However, Oliver opted for something simple: eggs, fresh bread, and juice.

As they sat at one of the tables near the panoramic window, they could observe the frenetic movement around them. On each recruit's face, the same expression of apprehension and expectation. Many had their eyes fixed on their gauntlets, fingers sliding quickly over the holographic interfaces, reviewing information about the exam, combat strategies, or opponent statistics.

""It seems everyone is trying to find some last-minute advantage,"" Katherine commented, observing a nearby group that was animatedly discussing.

""There's not much more to do besides being prepared,"" Oliver replied. ""We've already analyzed all the available data.""

Isabela took a sip of her coffee and sighed.

""Even so, the waiting is the worst part.""

For Oliver, breakfast passed in the blink of an eye. The mix of anxiety and adrenaline made time seem distorted. As quickly as they had descended to the first floor, they were already returning to the dormitories.

Back in the room, Isabela and Oliver paced back and forth, the restlessness evident in their movements. The metallic walls reflected their silhouettes, and the silence was broken only by the subtle hum of the life support systems.

On the other hand, Katherine was stretched out on the bed, appearing calm in contrast to her friends' tension. With a smooth gesture, she adjusted her gauntlet and began calculating probabilities.

""You know it will take at least four days just for this first event,"" she said, her eyes fixed on the data floating above her wrist. ""The chance of us being called in the first round is one in two hundred and seventy-seven.""

She hoped the information would help calm them, but it seemed to have the opposite effect. Oliver and Isabela exchanged worried glances.

Suddenly, a sound notification interrupted the silence.

| Exams will begin.

The message captured everyone's attention, including Katherine, who had just suggested they relax. They held their breath, anxiously awaiting a second alert indicating their calling. Seconds passed, but no other notification appeared on their gauntlets.

Instead, a girl lying near the door stood up abruptly, her eyes wide as she checked her device.

""I've been called!"" the girl exclaimed before hurriedly leaving the corridor.

Oliver exhaled, feeling a mix of relief and frustration.

""The first groups have been called,"" he said, more to himself than to the others.

""Maybe it's better this way; at least we can watch the others' competition before ours,"" Isabela said, turning on the hologram of her gauntlet and searching for the NEA channel.

""Maybe."" Oliver also sat on his bed and turned on the channel.

He switched from channel to channel to see how each of the thirty-six tests was arranged. Each room had sixty pillars in a circular formation, each with a recruit in front of it.

A small metal wall separated each recruit's area; however, it wasn't high enough to prevent someone from crossing into another arena.

Several recruits were already positioned in the arena. Some were stretching, and others were doing light exercises. Oliver was flipping through the channels until someone caught his attention.

One of the boys in arena fifteen—he was short and skinny. A deep scar ran across his face from one eye to the other. He was preparing to use a long whip in the competition.

""Damian?""

i (25M) met this girl (22F) on january 15th, we went to a date and drank some wine together. i immediately fell in love with her. she is 100% my type, and an incredible interesting person. we kissed that day in my car. 

4 days later, she travelled to japan with her family for two weeks, and then to madrid one month alone. the connection was AMAZING. after the date we talked EVERY single day, all day long about anything. i developed feelings for her and i thought she did too. she sent me a lot of “us in another universe” memes and reels, had a spotify playlist and played roblox together… we even had a list with +15 plans to do when she comes back 

i was very excited waiting for her coming back. she arrived this sunday early morning. we had planned going to a rave tonight like 3 weeks ago, and the same sunday she asked me to go out to have a coffee with me. obviously i did and i felt amazing. i was so happy to see her after all that time. 

after that, she asked me to go out again this tuesday, two days after the last date. everything felt amazing at first but at the end of the date i felt something was wrong, i dont know what. after the date she didn’t messaged me, and started to act very distant the days after, stopped sending me reels and listening to my audios.

today was the day of the rave we planned like 3 weeks ago, and she sent me a message telling me she wasn’t felling confortable going with me to the party and she feels we are not in the same page. she also told me that it wasn’t the same in person.

im heartbroken. i never had a connection like this in my whole life. she was the best girl i’ve ever met and all the illusions just erased in a couple of days. i dont know what to do.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1741394129.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

TW: self harm.

On December 27 2024, a police department in [REDACTED] received a call from a distressed psychiatrist who reported a physical attack of one of his patients on another, occurring as he spoke in his waiting room.

The situation appeared to be semi-normal on the phone, but once police came to the scene, it turned out to be more bizarre.

The attacker was a short, fragile-looking woman in her twenties. Despite that, she managed to knock another woman to the ground and beat her until two police officers didn’t disable her. Once the attacker has been disabled, she started showing symptoms of an anxiety attack, for which she had to be given sedatives. After she calmed down, she still expressed an intense fear of the individual which she beat. She asked to speak to her psychiatrist and told him „That’s her. That’s the person I’ve been telling you about. The one who destroyed me”.

While EMTs decided neither the attacker nor the victim were in shape to answer questions from the police, the psychiatrist was willing to cooperate and shared a great deal of valuable information. He said that several of his patients had a very similar pattern of behavior: after months of treatment and medication, they suddenly disappeared, telling him beforehand that „they are better now and don’t need meds anymore”. A few months after that, they always came back, in a fairly worse state than they were at the beginning of their treatment. Apparently, they all met someone who „made things better”, causing patients to stop therapy and take their medication, only to later „make everything worse”, by distancing themselves from the previously developed relationship to finally end it and disappear completely. All patients described being left by this person as feeling „robbed from the most important thing that they had” and „being physically deprived of happiness”. They also reported feeling fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and frequent headaches.

After hearing the same story a few times, the psychiatrist started getting suspicious. While the patients claimed they didn’t took other drugs after spontaneously deciding to stop treatment, all their symptoms matched those of a withdrawal syndrome. The psychiatrist believed that despite what the patients have been saying, the said person was, in fact, some sort of a drug dealer, who stopped providing service once the new client started getting too close to them.

He told the police he wanted to report this case, but because of lack of information and proof, he decided to wait. He wouldn’t have been able to identify the individual if not for a fight that occurred in his office. Even more unexpected was the fact that the suspected drug dealer was also his patient, who he described as „the most positive, radiant person that has ever been in my office – including myself”. When asked why the person in such a good shape came for help, he replied „She isn’t always like that, she has recurring depressive episodes. But even then, there is something utterly joyful about her that I can’t describe”.

The police took the matter in their hands and the patient was arrested on suspicion of drug dealing, but no drugs or evidence needed to support the charges were found in her house, on her computer or her phone. After a short interrogation one of the police agents, who has dealt with certain Pantheon inmates before and is, in fact, a friend to the [REDACTED], decided to contact the Agency of Helping Hands.

The woman cooperated at first and was successfully transported to the Pantheon, expressing rather excitement than fear regarding the travel across the ocean and a sudden change of her environment and living conditions. She asked if she could contact her family, and when the agency’s personel said that the access to the internet and her phone would not be limited, she expressed immediate relief and said that the situation „couldn’t be any better”.

The inmate is a 5’8 feet tall white woman 24 years of age. She has brown eyes and is able to change the length and color of her hair at will, which was the first thing she shared when asked about her abilities. As of now her hair is chocolate brown, shoulder length. Apart from this single protean characteristic, her appearance is constant.

While this inmate’s ability isn’t exactly extraordinaire, it is extremely valuable to everyone in the Agency. The individual is able to positively affect mood of people in close proximity to her. Simply put, she makes people feel better. The effect is semi-permanent and lasts from a few days to few weeks after the last real life contact with the inmate. While online or phone contact with the inmate can prolong this effect, it cannot begin that way, and it is always much stronger on those in the same space as her.

At the first contact with the inmate, approximately 90% of people are affected by her aura*. Even after a quick encounter with her people tend to feel more joyful, calmer and „relieved of worries”. When the inmate enters a new group, this effect can usually hold on for a few weeks, although in rare cases it lasts up to a few months. The endpoint seems to be the moment when the inmate starts to form closer bonds and relationships within the group. The effect becomes then limited to the few individuals with whom she formed a bond, but is much stronger on them than it was before.

It is important to stress the inmate can only make people feel better, which doesn’t always mean that she can make them feel good. It can be compared to how antidepressants work: the same dose has different effects on different people, and while for some it will be enough, for others it will be barely noticeable.

As every medication, the happiness the inmate gives people has side effects. The biggest one is withdrawal syndrome, experienced the most extremely by people who were under her influence for a long time. Interestingly, the symptoms match perfectly the description of withdrawal from different kinds of drugs. They include sweating, migraines, muscle aches, nerve pain and vomiting, which – given the explicitly psychological effect her power has – shouldn’t be possible.

Although the inmate is aware of her ability, she isn’t capable of controlling it. This trait is considered positive by the agency, because the inmate provides services by simply being with people, and doesn’t have to be forced to do anything against her will. However, the cost of the happiness she gives to others seems to be her own wellbeing. Luckily, she can quickly regrow her happiness, in similar way that a tree with a broken branch still foliates and puts forth a new one. A problem appears when she gives too much of her happiness away. While the damage is never too strong to destroy her permanently, sometimes it’s enough to put the grow on hold for a few weeks, or even months. The inmate then experiences symptoms of withdrawal similar to those felt by other people deprived of her happiness.

*It is under investigation what differentiates the unaffected 10% from the majority.

Interview subject: The Ray of Sunshine

Classification String: Uncooperative/Destructible/Casualty/Constant/Low/Hemitheos

Interviewer: Rachele B.

Interview Date: 03/08/2025

I don’t know how to make people talk. But they do it anyway.

It’s fine, I don’t mind it. I talk too. I talk a lot. Some people tend to like it more, especially when I talk about nice things. But I’m not gonna talk about nice things today. It’s not gonna be a nice story, and you probably won’t like it. It’s gonna be very long, too.

I’m sorry. I probably won’t make you feel better today.

What people don’t get about my ability is that it doesn’t come with charisma. I am not a likeable person. You’re probably gonna deny it. Please don’t. Everyone who likes me does. Everyone who meets me, too. But as you know, once people in my environment get used to me, this happy haze, what I like to call it, fades. I give too much of it to people who I like. The others aren’t affected anymore. And then they see that I am not a likeable person. I just have a vibe of one.

I used to be very rude. I used to tell people the truth all the time. This might sound like a good thing, but it’s really not. I cannot count how many times I said to my friends that their outfits are ugly. I once started a friendship by saying the guy’s name is shitty. It didn’t last particularly long, but certainly longer than I expected.

I don’t always tell the truth now, but I am still very candid. I like to describe myself with that word because when I first heard it, I thought it had something to do with candy. I still like to think it does, because people often tell me that I’m sweet. I guess I am. Until I melt on their tongue and they realize I’m rotten inside.

I’m sorry, I know that was edgy.

I’m a bit edgy. I’m blunt. I interrupt people, too. I talk a lot, I think I’ve said that before. I’m very open about what I feel and think. Some people are afraid of that. At least that’s what I tell myself. It’s better than admitting that it’s just annoying.

I never had many friends. I cherished the ones I did have with all my heart. I cherished my family, too. My mom loves me, which shouldn’t be anything special, but a lot of people don’t have that. I used to give a lot of happiness to my mom. She needed it the most when I was a teenager. I guess you can say she was going through a divorce, although she and her partner never married. It didn’t matter. It was tough.

My mom has always been very sad. I don’t think she would ever admit that, but I think she loves me so deeply partially because of my happiness. I started laughing very early as a baby. She says it has been contagious from the beginning.

Around the time I was fifteen, our household was drowning in sadness. It was too much, even for me. I couldn’t even neutralize it, let alone make the opposite grow. It got better once my mom’s ex moved out. I think she was responsible for most of the sadness. She had a very miserable life, so I don’t blame her. But it is a story for another time.

My mom was still sad, but not as much as before. That allowed me to regrow some of my happiness. I’m gonna tell you a story about how I spent all of it on one person.

When I was sixteen, I met this girl. She wasn’t particularly nice or charming. She was kind of ugly, too. But she needed help, and I have a thing for people who need help.

She was also creative and funny. She didn’t judge, which was kind of a miracle for a teenager. She liked the same books and movies as me, and had a lot of interesting things to say about them. She never got confused when I changed topics in a blink of an eye.

We met at a summer camp. Summer camps were always my thing. They were never long enough for the happy haze to wear off, and to cause all these creepy things that happen when you stop taking drugs. I guess for people it was more like trying a new drug at a party, not to get addicted, just to have fun. You know what I mean. I hope you do, because I don’t. I never took any hard drugs. I’ve seen what my happy haze can do to people. I felt it, too. It’s a better prevention technique than all those shitty educational movies about drugs compiled together.

I had a time of my life on this summer camp. I met a lot of amazing people there. Some of them are still my good friends. As you know, the happy haze works much worse on the internet, and we mostly communicate that way. That’s how I know they truly like me for who I am, and not for how I make them feel.

It should have alarmed me that right after the summer camp ended, this girl invited me to her house. I didn’t think much of it back then, apart from being happy someone liked me. Now I think she was very hungry.

It was fun. She lived by the sea. I got drunk for the first time there. Her friends were nice and older than me. She was older than me, too. Almost two years, which when you’re sixteen is not much and everything at the same time.

Her friends also didn’t judge. I was basically in heaven.

We got close. She hosted a first 18th years old birthday party I’ve been to. The only thing I remember from this party is her having a panic attack and me consoling her. I was good at it, and as it turned out, she had a lot of panic attacks. I could really prove my worth.

We visited each other quite often, despite painfully long train rides and our lack of a driving’s license. We talked for hours. We got drunk. We discussed our favorite books and our own creative writings. We romanticized everything, especially mental health problems.

Mental health problems were her favorite thing to discuss. She told me that she had a generalized anxiety disorder, undiagnosed, of course. It meant she was scared of everything. She was scared of bugs, for instance. A butterfly could give her a panic attack. She was scared of social interactions. She was scared of her mom. Most of all, she was scared of loneliness.

She told me that she was constantly afraid everyone would leave her. That sometimes she wanted to leave everyone, too. That sometimes she hurt herself. Just because everything got so scary and overwhelming.

„But you make it better”, she said. „You make me feel calm. You make me feel loved. You are my ray of sunshine”.

If your boss thought the nickname would be something creative, he was wrong. Basically one in three people I meet call me a ray of sunshine.

But it felt special when she did.

It took a while before we started dating. Almost a year, actually. I think she had to make sure I was the right one. She said I was her first love, but I don’t believe that’s true. I think I was her first need.

She moved to my city when she started university. I had still two years of high school ahead of me and lived with my mom. She lived in a dorm and had a roommate.

Like I said, not much and everything at the same time.

When she moved, she wanted to see me very often. If we didn’t see each other, we texted. If I didn’t text back for a few hours, she got very scared that I was going to leave her. So scared she cried. So scared that she got a panic attack.

So I usually texted her back very soon. I saw her very often. Every time I did, she told me I just made everything better. That it’s okay now, although she had been so scared before.

She got the most scared when I met with someone else. Anyone, really. It could have been my friend, my sister, my grandma. She told me she wasn’t jealous, just scared I was gonna leave her. Sometimes she got so scared that she hurt herself, too. She always told me about it afterwards, mostly to say she was sorry. She was always so, so sorry.

So I told her it was alright. When she told me she hated herself for that, I told her she was amazing.

I never got angry. How could I? She was sorry. Besides, it was her who was hurting, not me. And she never got angry at me when I was hurting. She just made sure she was always hurting more.

I told you, I never had many friends. It’s not like I met with other people very often. But I developed one pretty good friendship. It didn’t last, but it was really decent then.

When I was supposed to see him, she always had a bad day. One time it was particularly bad. So bad she started texting me she wanted to die. That she was gonna walk out of her apartment and never come back. That she would just stop eating, letting herself die slowly. That she would leave everyone before everyone left her. That she would eventually leave herself too, leave herself out to die.

She told me the exact time she’s gonna do it. That if I was not with her by that time, she would be gone.

I went to her, of course. I don’t know if I was more scared of her killing herself or of me being responsible for it.

I brought my friend. I still didn’t want to cancel our plans. When I told him about the situation, he insisted on calling her parents. I didn’t want to, but I gave him her mom’s number. He called her right away. She was, of course, very worried, but not worried enough to leave everything and come to us. She told us to let her know if she has to come once we get to her daughter.

When we got to her, she was unwell, but alive. Of course she was alive. I made it on time.

When she found out we called her parents, she got really mad. Like, really mad. I think that was one of the two times I saw her being mad at me. I don’t know how many times I had to say I’m sorry after that. I really was sorry, even though it was not me who called them. I would have never done that. I wouldn’t have had a stomach for that.

And it’s not like it actually changed something. Her mom texted me afterwards, asking me if I could take care of her. Calm her down, stay with her, make sure she was okay. She told me they could come if I couldn’t do that. Of course I told her I could do that. I was too scared to do anything else.

Once I calmed her down and consoled her, I actually did something with my friend later that day, while texting her and her mom that everything is under control. I’m glad he didn’t run away from me then, even though running away was probably the most reasonable thing to do.

I met her the next day at a cafe. She told me she was sorry, of course. That it was her fault. I disagreed.

I remember my hands being very cold. She took my hand and noticed it, too.

„You know that when you’re scared, your hands get cold” she said, „because all the blood goes to your legs, so you can run faster”.

I wish I listened to her then. But I was, and still am, a terrible runner. I wouldn’t have made it anyway.

Life went on. The next few month’s are a blur. She got panic attacks more and more often, I consoled her more and more often. I remember I started looking very bad. So bad that people started noticing. I’ve always been thin, but I got skinny. All my clothes were too big for me. I didn’t know why, though. I ate the same amount of food. I remember thinking I was infected with some kind of parasite.

I got headaches frequently. I was nauseous all the time. The smallest activity hurt me physically.

After some time, my friends told me to leave her. They weren’t even my good friends, but I looked like death. They just noticed something was very wrong and were concerned. I’m thankful they said something.

I tried to leave her. I really did. It was at my house. We were alone, my mom was drinking coffee with our neighbour next door.

I told her we needed a break. She started screaming. She screamed so loud my mom heard it and came. I told her, of course, to leave, because I have it under control. I obviously hadn’t, but she left. I think it was the pleading in my voice than convinced her.

That was the second time she got mad at me. She screamed that she hated me. She screamed that she hated herself. She screamed much more, but it was hard to make out her words. It was probably for the best. I’m glad I didn’t hear what she had to say.

While I was telling my mom I had it under control, she locked herself in the bathroom. I begged her to let me in. When she finally let me in, there was blood in the sink and she was crying. She didn’t have to tell me she hurt herself. She told me she was sorry. She told me not to leave her, because I was the only thing that made her happy.

I stayed. Only for a month, though. I broke up with her the day after my 18th birthday. I think it was the first grown-up decision I made.

I like to think I was brave for leaving, but it isn’t true. I was just too goddamn tired. I was going through a withdrawal. I reached the point when I couldn’t give any more happiness to anyone, including myself. It wish it was the last time I reached that point.

So I got better. I gained weight and my head stopped hurting. I got to regrow my happiness. I got to cherish it for a while, before I gave it away again.

A lot has changed since then. I think I’m generally good now. I still have a lot of sad people around. It’s not like I can change it. I mean, I kinda can. But only to some extent.

I know there’s a lot of sad people here. Sadder than the girl I told you about and sadder than my mom when she was going through the divorce. I must admit, I’m a bit scared.

But I guess I didn’t make you feel better today, right? And if it doesn’t always work, they cannot always use me. I don’t want them to use me. I have a lot of happiness right now.

And for once in my life, I don’t want to share.",8,1741393634.0,NorthAmericanPantheon,6,1.0,False

1j64o33,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1j64o33/feeling_lost_what_to_do/,Feeling lost what to do,"Let me start the story. I’m a boy with big dreams and a poor background. I had my early education in a small town and studied at a local school until the 8th grade, where I was a good student and also helped my father with his small grocery business. My father didn’t have a big business, just a small one, and the income was very little. My mom worked hard too. After I completed the 8th grade, my parents had to move, and our situation worsened, forcing us to sacrifice a lot.

I was still good in studies, but I didn’t have the money to join coaching classes or anything extra. Sometimes, I helped my parents with their small business. Being poor, introverted, and underconfident, no one wanted to be friends with me. I was studying in a government school with little to no facilities. I used to ride my bicycle for 5 km in the morning to reach school and another 5 km to get back home.

After completing 10th grade, I joined another school that was even worse than the previous one. In 11th grade, I didn’t study at all because I became friends with people who weren’t interested in studying. That year, I didn’t study much. At that time, I was planning to become an IAS officer. After 11th grade, I decided to surround myself with better people, so I joined three coaching classes—Physics, Chemistry, and Maths—for 12th grade. There, I met some good people, but we didn’t become close friends because I wasn’t from their school. However, I made valuable connections.

I woke up at 6 AM, rode my bicycle for 5-6 km to the coaching center, then went to school, came back home, studied, and then rode another 5-6 km for two coaching classes. I did this for 10 months. Then my result came, and I scored 90%. It wasn’t up to my expectations, as I needed at least 95% to attend a top university. My whole existence crumbled, and I didn’t know what to do.

One day, I thought I should start studying for UPSC, so I began with a book called Lucent. I studied for one day, but since the book was in English and I had studied in Hindi my whole life, I couldn’t understand anything. I realized it wasn’t for me. Then, I thought about how my parents couldn’t afford to send me to a better city for 4-5 years. I cried, wondering what to do.

Then I thought, “Let’s take a gap year, study for JEE, or wait for another year if the university cut-off drops.” From December to October of the following year, not much happened. But during this time, I got into tech. I bought a second-hand i3 laptop and started learning about computers and technology. I come from a place where most people don’t even know much about computers, so no one could teach me.

In October, I took admission in a college, but my whole existence crumbled again. I saw people enjoying coffee culture, dating, partying, and roaming around. I was shocked. I had already started focusing on work and avoided all these distractions, so I had no friends in college.

From October to May, I got my first client in tweet writing. I wanted to get into coding, but my laptop kept hanging, and I didn’t have the money or resources to join a coding coaching class. Then, in May, I got a big client who paid me 1 lakh per month for more than a year. During this time, I became more comfortable and started supporting my family—buying essential things for our home, gadgets for myself, and even building a house, since we had lived in a terrible one before.

But when ChatGPT arrived, I lost my job. My work became irrelevant, and to be honest, I wasn’t enjoying it anymore. I wanted to focus on business and tech-related things, but during this time, I wasn’t studying or learning much. Instead, I spent time improving myself socially and physically while adjusting to life in a bigger city.

In 2024, I wasted time on reels, social media, and dating, which all failed, and I also spent time grooming myself. I didn’t make any money in 2024 and survived off my savings. Now, it’s February 22, 2025, and my college is ending in two months. I feel depressed about my career. I recently visited home, and my parents are in a bad situation. I feel like the worst son ever and like a complete failure.

I have generalized skills in many digital areas. I think I’m more interested in business, like building an IT solutions agency, but I don’t know how to start. I’ve also considered working on Telegram bots, but I can’t focus on one thing. I procrastinate a lot and feel underconfident. I often feel left out. I always wanted to become a millionaire by 2024, but I’ve failed. I have big dreams, but I feel like a failure.


Tldr: I am at worst phase of my life, no money, no job, lost my power to think. Distracted. Feeling suicidal. What to do ",3,1741393542.0,AskMenOver30,2,1.0,False

He didn’t wash it. I’ve never seen it get washed. He said it was “seasoned”

It’s a whiteish mug, pretty big, ringed around the outside with a small flared base. Some kind of plastic, but very very durable. 

My questions are:
1) if I chose to do something like that would I inevitably end up sick?
2) what kind of coffee mug did he have that would hold up 26 years or more? 

It was only ever black coffee too. Nothing added. Folgers brand.",1,1741393454.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,1.0,False
