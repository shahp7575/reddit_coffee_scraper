0.

I'm so tired of this.

Yes, yes, yes, I'm someone who has dreams, aspirations, goals, hobbies, interests, and a sense of agency. I'm currently in a big city for winter break before going back to school in a white town (I'm biracial but present as black, and struggle to get matches up there). I cook, I sing, I write my own songs, I play guitar, I play bass, I roller skate, I watch cool TV shows, I have my own podcast where I discuss relationships/culture, I'm about to get my bachelor's and plan on getting a master's to become a therapist, I'm a crisis counselor, I know so much about reflective listening, and I generally show up as a good boyfriend in relationships (I always goes shoulder-to-shoulder with my partner when facing a problem, I take accountability and avoid getting defensive, I never pretend to understand or assume things my partner goes through in their own lived experience as a woman, etc.).

Pretty much, I'm a decent guy!! I don't expect everyone to like me. And it frustrates me that I still have not met a single person from this app. Mostly because people ghost me. I try and say something either respectful and flirty (""I love your hair + outfit!! It's very you :)"") or funny and blunt (I respond to a girl's text box answer that she hates planning with, ""NO. YOU PLAN."" and I actually got a good running banter after she matched with me).

Yet as soon as I say, ""hey, I love our convo and i want to meet you for some coffee if you're down,"" it's straight up crickets lmaooo. Yes, I've tried saying it differently, in different phrasing, at different times (usually after a few messages or later). Some respond and will actually give me a day and location. Yet when I confirm a specific time, they don't respond, the day comes, and I never meet them. I've even checked in on people who have ghosted me, yet they don't respond. It hurts me so much because I am such a well-put-together person, I know what I want in my life, and I generally have a good life direction, yet I feel like I'm always ignored and never chosen. I know the ghosting is not a reflection of myself or my value as a person, but it still hurts and it still frustrates me.

Also, a lot of people will normalize ghosting in this fashion by saying, ""It's not ghosting if they haven't met you."" I just feel like that gives people permission to keep doing this kind of behavior that is dismissive and disrespectful.

Edit: as a side note, I'm one for one in-person, going on one date with one person I asked out (and sorry, it's not a numbers game, I know this sentence can come off wrong). I'm also not saying that men have it easier than women, or anything of that sort. It's not a game of comparison for me. I'd just like to have a chance to actually meet some people, get to know them, and for them to get to know me so there's an actual chance of something coming to fruition.",2,1767068325.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

I know my voice definitely passes, but I think I'm pretty clocky otherwise. my first year on hrt, socialy transitioning etc, I got heckled a number of times. definitely noticed people being rude to me, people staring at me, but no one does that anymore. I work at a cafe and I'm customer facing all the time, but most people I interact with are actually quite nice, I rarely notice any weird looks, and even people that look the type to be transphobic never start anything with me. I know Baltimore is a pretty queer city, and I know a coffee shop probably caters to a more accepting demographic. a question that constantly eats at me is, am I actually passing and people just don't clock me as trans, or do people see me as trans but are just respectful of my identity? in the past 2 years I've only been misgendered twice, one time was by a transphobe and the other was an accident bc my voice wasn't great at the time and she corrected herself. I feel like with the high volume of people I interact with everyday, just statistically I should have run into at least a few transphobes, or even noticed some kids snickering about me or something. but I haven't experienced any of that.
I just safety wise, I'm trying to figure out if I just pass for most people, or if I just happen to live in a bubble where people clock me but are never rude about it. has anyone else had a similar experience? anyone who moved to Baltimore from somewhere else, and noticed that people were more trans friendly, or vice versa?
I know how subjective passing is, but it's just the sheer volume of people I interact with compared to the very few times anyone was disrespectful that makes me think maybe I actually do just pass, even if I don't think so myself.",2,1767068094.0,trans,3,1.0,False

1pz7xon,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1pz7xon/death_of_estranged_mother_2yrs_on/,Death of estranged mother- 2yrs on,"Edit: I'm sorry, this postn is a bit rambling and I dont know what I'm looking for. It's my first time writing about any of this part of my life.

My (36f) mother (56f) died suddenly and unexpectedly almost 2 years ago. It's a complicated situation I guess. 

Background: 
My mother was violent, aggressive, physically and emotionally abusive to me and my siblings when I was growing up. When I was 12, out of nowhere (or so it appeared to me at the time) she left. I remember hearing a voicemail from her declaring she had no kids and no husband to never contact her again. So...I didn't. None of us did. My dad continued to raise myself and my siblings as a single parent. 
Actually I lie, I reached out shortly before I got married because I guess I was feeling somewhat emotional missing out on the mother/daughter aspects of planning a wedding. That was met with name calling and further abusive behaviours so I never reached out again. (oh the reappearance repressed trauma! What was I thinking?) It instilled such fear and anxiety in me that I hired security for my wedding just in case she found out the details and turned up 

Anyway, between that exchange and ger death, zero contact. 

I received a call from father one day almost 2 years ago who told me she had died. Her brother contacted my father who in turn was the messenger. I froze, I couldn't breathe. I was relieved, upset, worried, afraid, confused, relieved again, then felt guilty for feeling all of those. Then it got worse...
Her family decided since we were her children and my father was still technically married to her, it fell on us to provide a funeral. 

My brother took on the task, against all of our wishes. Then somehow we all, one by one, got drawn in. For me personally, if my name was going to be associated with this person, I wanted to control how. Things got out of hand though, her family completely abandoned her and us during the planning process, then turned up and the funeral and refreshments afterwards. 100% of all costs and duties fell to us. My dad blanked, he stepped out, he couldn't believe we were doing this. Neither could I, but in hindsight, man, grief makes a person do strange things. 

Anyway, thanks to my brother being a ""yes man"" with the funeral director, and taking the lead in making plans without telling the rest of us siblings, I and my siblings were side-swiped wgen we were taskrd last minute with carrying her coffin and and out of the church for the funeral. Wtf... how did that happen. I wasn't going to make a scene in a church, in front of my father, my friends, my work colleagues who had come to support me. I had to just go along with it. 

Later same day, after the refreshments, which my husband and I paid for (teas, coffees, sandwiches), my mother's brother asked the staff for a copy of the receipt, and spent the next few weeks parading it around claiming he paid for the whole thing. Again, wtf...

For some context, my mother's family are all slightly aggressive, do their own thing, very sensitive people, who likely have mental health issues, alcoholism, and like to be centre stage without putting in the work. She had met another man, a long term partner, who also stepped back and let us take all of this on. Birds of a feather eh...

I dont really know where I'm going with this. I guess, it's 2 years on, it's Christmas, I'm still affected by the whole thing. The way the funeral went, the sudden-ness, the sheer confusion of this new kind of grief. I found out my mother had some mental health disorders I was previously unaware of, namely munchausens/fictitious disorder imposed on self, as well as borderline personality disorder. It resolves and explains so much for me knowing this. 

But I still grieve...I grieve the mother she was in little good moments in my childhood, I grieve the loss of any chance of a future relationship - not that I wanted one at the time of her death. I grieve the concept of a mother. Something I needed so so many times in adolescence and adulthood but never had, not even close. I feel guilty for feeling free, but I feel sad. 

Anyway, I think I'm rambling now. I guess I'm wondering how a person who caused so much trauma in my younger years, continues to invade moments like christmasses and birthdays and turn them sad. I wish there was a timeline on this. 

Also, I conclude that I definitely need therapy!

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

This coffee shop 1000% deserves the hype--their pastry selection + CEREMONIAL grade matcha (capped at $7 for milk alts + HOMEMADE syrups) are all *reasonably* priced and their workers are always so friendly and helpful. The only thing I would ask differently is more seating, longer times, and 7 days/week opening.

Comparatively, I don't understand why SolidGrounds and Cafe Gudcha workers are always so snobby when you order and their coffees are at an insane price hike ($10 for a 20oz is actually insane) and their matcha is...gray at best. Slowalk's wifi is terribly slow and their prices are also insanely expensive but at least the vibes are excellent and they have an expansive seating area + the museum is well curated. Infusion is okay with seating and selection but their prices are expensive (their 10:1 points ratio redeems them imo) and the wifi seems to ALWAYS crash at 2pm. Customer service at infusion varies but I find the workers at the Tamuning location to be more hospitable. The hotel cafes are below average at the very least, Hilton/Westin/Hyatt are obviously tourist traps so their coffees are at minimum $6+.

As the title suggests, I am a 30 year old gentleman from Toronto. I’m 6’4”, ethnically Eastern European with a bald head and hazel eyes. I work for a medical practice as part of the administrative management team albeit I’m currently in the running of for a contract position with the federal government, as my dream job is to become an auditor. 

Now about who I actually am like as a person - I’m an INTP, am deeply spiritual and strive to live as intentionally as much as possible. I love to read books about the esoteric, discuss philosophy and contemplate religious doctrines (my current practice aligns most closely with Vajrayana Buddhism). Physically, I’m trying to get healthier which is why I have been regularly going to the community pool as of late in order to increase my stamina. 

Anyways, I’ll likely be heading to Amsterdam this summer for no less than a week and would appreciate having some company! Specifically, I’d like nothing more than a woman with whom I could connect and vibe with as we explore the Netherlands. As I understand this can take time, I’d be happy to meet up with you in Toronto first for coffee or drinks (although I’m staying sober) to see if we’d be a good fit and if we should proceed further. If this post is still up, that means I’m still accepting responses.


Looking forward to hearing from you!

But I would greatly appreciate anyone that has professional experience in Cyber, Database management, Game Development... to give their thoughts as well.

  
**1. UBISOFTS LANGUAGE WAS DELIBERATE**

In cybersecurity we like to stay away from the ""B-Word"" as much as possible, the fact that Ubisoft did not classify this incident as a ""Breach"" is absolutely raising a red flag for me... Once you use the B-word, you essentially enter this point of no return where you have admitted defeat. Often times this means federal organizations and digital forensics experts will get involved; as sensitive data was most likely stolen or tampered with in some way. Calling this a ""server incident"" is extremely alarming to me considering the threat actors were able to modify the attributes to user accounts, specifically an entity like R6 credits which is tied to real-life money. What kind of ""server incident"" involves a threat actor gaining authoritative access to a backend system? A ""server incident"" is when Battlefield 6 had too much traffic to let players play on launch day, a ""server incident"" is when you get some unexpected downtime because the intern poured coffee in the NOC room. 

  
**2. UBISOFT IS UNDERMINING THE SITUATION, WHICH LEADS ME TO BELEIVE THE SITUATION IS WORSE THAN THEY DESCRIBED.**

  
Just to re-iterate here: a threat actor was able to gain full authorized access to a backend system. A privilege escalation of this caliber MOST CERTAINLY entails that sensitive information could have been exposed to threat actors. Although Ubisoft has stated there is no evidence of sensitive data being exposed; in this instance a lack of evidence does not necessarily mean sensitive information WASN'T accessed. A system that permits a privileged user to write/modify/delete attributes of a users account may very reasonably also be able to observe sensitive information tethered to those accounts. 

  
**3. PUT YOURSELF IN THE POSITION OF THE HACKERS, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO GAIN FROM THIS?**

This type of attack can easily result in a life in prison, especially up against a law team powered by a corpo as big as Ubisoft. You're telling me someone placed a target on their head just for the troll value? That is absolutely ridiculous to suggest, even if it was: historically hackers that evoke incidents in this regard are much louder and attention-seeking. Think lizard squad or anonymous... Nobody orchestras a sophisticated cyber attack without an incentive, otherwise they would be creating offensive security tools and contracting them out to cyber defense companies, living a life of luxury. I can't say I know many people willing to sacrifice that opportunity just to troll a video game developer. 

  
**TL:DR**

Ubisoft is beating around the bush, just because there isn't evidence of data being leaked doesn't mean it wasn't. Why would a hacker conduct such an attack for the sake of trolling? ",16,1767067060.0,Rainbow6,1,0.86,False

IFE was top-notch, especially with bluetooth connectivity built-in. Food was decent and crews friendly + passionate although they served me the wrong drink (hot coffee when I requested iced) once. Almost burned my throat... They did make it right afterwards without me even asking though, so kudos! 

However, it's true what people say: the economy seats feel pretty cramped for a full-service airline, almost to LCC level. Hell, some LCCs like Peach have seats spaced wider apart on their A321neos which I also have flown. 

Going to the toilet is quite a chore too, being on economy with other passengers and crews moving about

Verdict: still OK for sub-3 hour flights, but especially for longer ones try to aim for the widebodies, unless if you want the full CX IFE offerings on routes not served by Cathay's long-haul jets like the A350",2,1767066776.0,CathayPacific,0,1.0,False

Stanley Quencher 2.0 - Worth the Wait?! 🤔💦,"Okay, real talk, who else has been seeing these Stanley tumblers EVERYWHERE lately? I swear, my FYP was *flooded* with them for weeks, and I was like, 'Is it just a tumbler, or is there something more?' 

Well, I finally caved and snagged one, and I think I get it now. It's more than just a cute cup, it's seriously become my go-to for staying hydrated without even trying.

Here's why this thing is blowing up:

*   **Insulation is INSANE**: Seriously, I'll make iced coffee in the morning, and there's still ice clinking around at dinner time. Hot drinks stay hot for hours too. No more lukewarm disappointment!
*   **Built Like a Tank**: Dropped it already (oops!) and it's completely unfazed. The stainless steel feels super robust, no dents or scratches. Plus, that **FlowState™ lid** is a game-changer – no spills even when it's jostling around.
*   **The Handle & Straw Combo**: This sounds minor, but carrying it around is SO easy with the ergonomic handle. The straw is perfectly placed, making sipping effortless. It genuinely makes me drink more water (or coffee!) throughout the day.
*   **Aesthetic Goals**: Let's be honest, they come in some seriously gorgeous colors. It's one of those things that's functional *and* looks good sitting on your desk or in your car cup holder.

My verdict? If you're someone who struggles to drink enough water, or you just appreciate a well-made, durable item that also looks good, this is genuinely worth the hype. It's not just a trend; it's a seriously practical upgrade for your daily hydration game. I'm officially converted!

1pz7os3,https://www.reddit.com/r/groomingvictim/comments/1pz7os3/im_ruined/,I'm ruined,"I'm 18 now. But ever since I was 13, I've been groomed, assaulted and used for my body way too many times.


Next part will include blackmail
It all started when I was 13. I just wanted to have a friend. So I talked to a stranger online. If I remember right he was 40 something. Idk why I trusted him, but long story short. As soon as I sent one pic he just blackmailed me. I tried blocking him, but he just me a new Instagram account. It ended up at a point I completely deleted my Instagram account.  Also I still remember when he called me. And I rember how he said ""show me your boobs"" those words won't ever leave my mind. Neither will the image of my naked body.


I was also groomed 3 other times at that age by 3 other people but nothing really happened with them other then the fact I sent my pics.


Then when I was 14 I met a guy that was 24. He offered me money for nudes. Because I was desprete for money I agreed, and he gave me money.  And that went on till I was 17. He often told me we could stop anytime. But when I said no he kept reaching out to me and asking me over and over again offering more and more money.  Because of him I now have a problem with spending too much money. I got used to spending so much money that now I just don't know how to hold myself back.


15. This wasn't so major but my cusin touched my tits without my consent while tickling me so I had no way to tell him to stop. I didn't think about it much back then, but now that I think about it back it's kinda wierd.
Next one will mention disturbing themes, 



like sh and ED
16. This only lasted few days. But It was pretty disturbing. He was in his mid 20s. And he was looking for Dom/sub relationships. He basically made me starve myself, made me vomit on camera, allowed me to drink only coffee, water and alcohol, he would make me cut myself everyday on video call. He also made me do really disgusting things... Like licking the toilet. I'm short because of him I got an alcohol addiction that would last months after because  that's how I coped with everything.




Mention of sh
17. Just few toxic relationships. Also one of my boyfriend's made my carve his name on my thighs.


Next one will mention drugs and rape threats
18. This isn't really grooming cuz I'm 18 but it's. Sexual assault non the less. He's 20 something. And basically a friend of mine got high on meth. So he started spam calling me and when I answered he said he was coming to my house. And how he had drugs for me and I'm exchange I had to fuck him. I said no. He said I have no choice. He kept calling me telling me how close to my house he was getting closer. Then after I told him I told my parents right as he was really close to my house he chickened out. Even tho nothing really happened, it left me damaged. My heart started making sudden unusal shifts due to stress for few weeks. I had trubble sleeping because of the fear he might show up.


Next part is gonna have disturbing intrusive thoughts
I thought about starving myself till there's just skin and bones so nobody would ever want me again. I wanted to take an axe and cut of by breasts. I wanted for pain to just stop.
I'm ruined. Everything about me is ruined. My thoughts, my memories, my eyes, my thighs, my holes. 
I just wanna be loved. But not for my body. I just seem to attract toxic people tho.

  
I hate myself.

1pz7o6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOLA/comments/1pz7o6j/a_not_at_all_concise_overview_of_my_experience_in/,A (not at all) concise overview of my experience in New Orleans,"Hi all, I visited NOLA for the first time over Christmas because I had an opportunity fall into my lap to do so. I have a friend with a granddad who lives in Mandeville across the lake & once I was given the go-ahead that it was okay for me to stay, I decided to jump at the opportunity.

I flew into Louis Armstrong from Charlotte Douglas and I had a good first impression of Louis Armstrong. It looked pretty clean and it had a grand sense of scale. I headed straight for baggage claim and I was surprised how quickly I got my luggage (Charlotte Douglas is laughably terrible in how long it can take to get your luggage from BC). From there I got picked up at the airport and me and my buddy got PJs in either Kenner or Metairie and headed to city park thereafter.

City Park was really fun, I don't know for sure if it's larger than Central Park but it definitely felt like it. We went up to NOMA, going through the outside park of the Museum with the sculptures and walking paths. Once we'd had our fill of that we went to some hut that was renting out Canoes, Kayaks, Bikes, etc. and decided that we wanting to go canoeing. It was pleasant barring the sun beating down on my face (my fault OG) and some debris along the canoe route.

After canoeing in the park we went to Katies, where I got my first taste of NOLA cuisine that I was greatly looking forward to. At Katies I ordered a BBQ Shrimp po-boy  and it was delicious. I also decided to take my first swing at drinking in NOLA and this is where I learned my alcohol tolerance isn't what it used to be, as I immediately caught a buzz. It was a good drink though, I don't remember what it was I ordered but it was a fruit-punch like cock-tail, it had the right balance of bitter and sweet. After Katies we walked around the surrounding area just looking at houses until we tried (and failed) to get ice cream at creole creamery. Since it was the 24th shit was closing early and google maps kept lying to us (aka we were too lazy to check a given business's socials to see holiday hours).

Following that we went straight to the Quarter, primarily to walk around and just look at stuff. I of course headed directly for Bourbon being the tourist I was and even on Christmas Eve Bourbon was packed with people, drum circles, jazz ensembles, hot dog stands, and of course, lots, and lots, and lots of bars. We worked our way to Tropical Isle because I wanted a hand grenade. I thought this drink was going to taste like complete crap but I was too curious not to try it. Much to my surprise however I ended up really liking the drink and definitely regained a buzz. After walking around a mixture of Jackson SQ, The Riverfront, & Decatur St, we cut our losses and called it a night as most of the stuff we wanted to do was closed   
  
We didn't go to NOLA at all on the 25th as we assumed most stuff was gonna be closed anyway, so we waited until the 26th to go back. This was the only truly full day I had in NOLA, as we stayed out there until 11 PM after going into the city at like 8 or 9 AM that day. Our first stop of the day was at a breakfast spot called Toast. It was recommended to us by my friend's brother and he was COOKING with this recommendation. It was a brunch spot but it kinda of had the vibe of a soul food restaurant. I kept it simple and went with a bacon egg and cheese biscuit as I had plans of eating in NOLA later that day and I wanted to save my appetite because NOLA (and Louisiana in general from what I've been told) loves large portion sizes, so I knew it was a bad idea to get something big early on.

Our next objective was Canal St/The Quarter because there was this bookshop in the Quarter I wanted to check out. Before that though, I got to witness I10 and man, driving on the road beneath it really makes you realize how Heinous that land use was, and still is. I know every city that has a major Interstate running through it is obviously a sign that there had to be some segregation that took place, but holy shit to me in NOLA it's obvious more than any other city I've been to just how obvious the displacement was, like I see these residential areas that, based off architecture had been there long before I-10 was constructed, and it's just a harrowing reminder of the damage that the interstate highway system undeniably did to our greatest cities. Apologies for that barrel of laughs but that was a thought that ran through my head everytime we had to drive on, or under I10. As for the book shop in the quarter, it was pretty cool, had a very old timey feel, even had a great cat (I saw a lot of cats in NOLA) I didn't walk away with anything though.

After that we went through the riverfront mall. It was fine, nothing crazy, has some cool stores, I'm just not into malls anymore, this was something my buddy wanted to show me. From there we tried taking the train car back up to the Quarter. This is where I learned that the street cars are not a reliable means of getting around NOLA. After about 15 minutes of waiting with no street car in sight (despite the RTA app telling us the train car was there) we decided fuck it and just walked up the street, making a change of plans and heading for the Garden District (mainly Magazine Street). After waiting over 20 minutes for our bus, it finally arrived and we headed to a record store called Peaches Records. Despite the long wait I was pleasantly surprised by how chill the bus was. It got us to our destination within 10 minutes of hopping on and the bus itself was shockingly clean.

We arrive to peachtree records, and unfortunately I didn't like this store at all. With apologizes to the shopkeepers in the chance they browse this subreddit, I just thought the store was egregiously overpricing records. I'm not talking overpriced compared to back home, I'm talking overpriced compared to the Bay Area, NYC, & New England. The store admittedly is a spectacle to browse, it's laid out well and I think the organization is great, but I just can't overlook how overpriced that place was. It's no matter though because just up Magazine was a store called Sisters in Christ, and to say this place was the polar opposite would be an understatement. It was priced excellently. The selection was honestly just as good, if not better than Peaches. I walked out of here with Terror Twilight and The Hot Rock by Pavement and Sleater Kinney respectively.

After record crawling we walked to Creole Creamery, this time we were successful in getting Ice Cream. I ordered a gingerbread snap cheesecake Milkshake and that thing was delicious, they also gave me a lot of milkshake as well. Jumping ahead a bit. With NOLA, I'm happy to say I don't feel like I got ripped off once at any of the places I ate at. Pricey? Sure. Quality? It was there in spades. Portion Sizes? If anything they were too big (complimentary). Following Creole we went to Frankies and Johnny's. I assumed that they were gonna have Crawfish Etouffe. Once I learned they didn't, I decided to go with red beans and rice with sausage since that's one of the NOLA staples and I wasn't even disappointed because that was a good dish right there. 

From there we went to Audubon park and just walked around the area. We walked to the Tree of Life and just took it in. That tree is a thing of beauty and apparently its been there for centuries? incredible. From there we walked up the park until we got to St Charles. It was a very pleasant park to walk through, I honestly liked it just as much as City Park. I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that Tulane University was so close. Now I unfortunately didn't full on Explore Tulane's campus but the exterior of the uni was really nice. We rode the Street Car up to Broadway so I could check out another record store called Mushroom, which I would say was the most unique record store, possibly even store that I visited on my trip. It just had a really funky vibe to it. The shopkeeper was a pleasant person to speak to, I was just telling them about how my trip was going up until that point. I ended up walking out of that store with the Criterion Collection 4K UHD release of Citizen Kane for 13 dollars.

After that we rode the Street Car back to Canal St. It was kinda fun, until the street car broke down and the car operator had to go out and do some light maintenance to get the car running again. We ended our night back on Canal ST & The Quarter. Not much really happened here other than walking around but I got to try a frozen Irish Coffee, it was delicious but it's more than likely going to be a one time only drink for me.

Just before we left NOLA my friend was incessant that I try Raising Canes in LA. We went to the location in Metairie just before you go on the Causeway. I didn't expect much since I don't really like fast food anymore and Canes was just okay to me. The actual food quality is fine, definitely better than other fast food joints but it just lacks seasoning to me, the Sauce undoubtedly elevates Canes, rather that's a good or a bad thing, is for you to decide. 

Last day of the trip. We didn't get to NOLA until like 3 PM that day because I wanted to check out the Gulf Coast of MS, get Buc-ees, and have The Shed BBQ. Once we did that we went back to NOLA. Once we got into LA I decided to take 310 until we hit US 90 because I wanted to see Bayous and Swamp Ass. It was kinda surreal tbh. We have swamps back in Eastern NC but nothing like what yall have in East NOLA (or LA in general for that matter). We're just driving until we hit 510. I look to my right, see a Ferris wheel that looks decrepit, much to my surprise, I realize that it's the abandoned 6 flags over NOLA (I always thought it was closer in to the city proper, but looking back, I don't know why I thought this) a harrowing reminder of Hurricane Katrina that remains even 20 years after the Hurricane nearly wiped out New Orelans, and sadly that wasn't the only reminder. Because while driving I10 in East NOLA. I saw so much poverty and blight that I couldn't begin to even comprehend, it made me upset more than anything.

Now look, I know in general, East NOLA is kind of a sore spot no matter if you love New Orleans to pieces like I do, or think the city sucks (yet for some reason browse this subreddit?). I'm aware that East NOLA has a tragic history and many factors related and unrelated to Katrina that are beyond the scope of this reddit post are why East NOLA is the way it is today. Everyone has their stories of East NOLA and it isn't my place to question the legitimacy of those stories. But I'll say this, I've heard a lot of stuff about how dangerous I10 through East NOLA is and I can't say that those stories reflect my experience, and I was on I10 through East NOLA for a great deal of time. I wouldn't say it was a comfortable drive because of fellas going way above the speed limit coupled with the poverty and blight that I could see off of the interstate without even looking for it. But I wouldn't describe it as life-threatening or super dangerous. If anything there were streets I drove through in the city proper that felt more scuffed to me than anything that I saw/drove through in East NOLA. 

After that drive we went to the bywater neighborhood so I could go to Euclid Records. This was easily the best record store on the trip. It had the spectacle of peaches, the solid pricing paired with the incredible selection of sisters in christ, and the vibe of mushroom. After we got to walk over the Rusty Rainbow Bridge and walk the river up until one final trek to the Quarter. This was where I finally got to indulge in the Etouffe that I had so desperately been craving, and yeah, it lived up to the hype and then some. I got it at a restaurant called Coop's Place. It was an amazing restaurant in general, it had a dive bar feel and the staff were friendly to me. Following Coop's my buddy walked me to Louis Armstrong Park, which I was excited for, but ultimately disappointed by when I got there. It just looked way dirtier compared to City Park and Audubon. Those are much larger parks yet they looked way cleaner than Louis Armstrong Park did. Mind you I didn't think the park was completely trashed, but there were walkways that had quite literally been flooded, it have me the impression that the city doesn't care about upkeeping Louis Armstrong Park nearly as much as City and Audubon Park. Following one last walk around of The Quarter, we had left NOLA and it was time for my stay to end.  
  
Turns out this post wasn't as concise as I wanted it to be, but New Orleans is a city that has a lot to say about it, and a city that I honest to god love love love love love love love in spite of its many many many many many many many problems. I wanted to share my experience because I had a blast with NOLA and I eagerly await the day I get to visit it again. NOLA is honestly one of my favorite cities in the country.

Except, she kinda is, after 6+ years of every 2 weeks, I maintain it's normal to treat her more like a friend (wife obviously disagrees).

Occasionally (like once every 1.5 to 2 months, but as is pointed out to me, is only every 3 or 4 visits or so) she'll ask if she can have a coffee pod (she either forgot to bring her own coffee, or ran out of time to get one, whatever).  

Wife insists that letting her have a coffee is unprofessional and I shouldn't do it.  Says she is taking advantage of my kindness.  While I don't disagree that she shouldn't forget to bring her coffee, we all forget stuff, and once she's here, she's stuck here for 6 hours (she can't leave even to run get coffee).  

In fairness, I need to also note that I don't drink coffee, and while we buy coffee with our household spending budget, wife is the only one who really drinks it. I was also raised so that if you have a guest, you offer them a drink.

Long story short, wife wants me to not offer coffee when nurse asks.  I managed to avoid it for a while but then nurse asked if she could have a coffee, I let her have one (but intentionally gave her the one my wife doesn't really like, as opposed to wife's favorite).  Wife is passed at me, says I'm TAH for giving her the coffee.

Hit Newnan, GA early evening. An off-duty trucker picked me up on the ramp in Anderson, GA in his personal vehicle. ""I don't ever do this, but you looked like you needed a ride. I had him drop me at a Pilot before where he was going since I still had a bit left on the e-card I was given a few days previous.

People at the truck stop were really nice. Didn't seem to mind me just hanging out charging and writing up my story on reddit. (Yeah, the one that crashed on me and sent me into a rage. 😆 I might rewrite it when I get to a spot I can hang for a bit.)

After dark it was time to find a spot to camp for the night. Lots of trees around, but with a dim flashlight and fifty-one year old eyes I couldn't find a way in. Wound up setting my tent up behind a couple of berms right in the runway flight path. Good enough for a night.

Packed my gear the next morning since I wasn't in a good spot to leave it. Headed for the truck stop.

Hung out Christmas day in the truck stop. Lots of screwing around on the interwebs. Outside for some smokes.

Got tired in the afternoon so I went out while it was still light and found a killer spot in the pines. I had my own little Christmas forest to myself. Like most spots I find it was good enough to leave my gear.

December 26th...

Into the Pilot for coffee and some donughts. ($5 yay!) Still kind worn out, so headed back to my tent after a couple hours. Had a nice nap. Broke down camp around 2:00. Off to the ramp. Gear down. Thumb out.

Three hours later got picked up by a Latino couple. They had me put my destination in their phone due to not speaking much english. Then took me all the way there. I got the feeling they were just giving me a ride because it was Christmas and they wanted to do something nice for somebody. They didn't seem to be going anywhere in particular. I had them drop me on the southernmost exit of Montgomery, AL. It was past dark.

It was a TA. The dude working the outside was cool. Said hi to me while I was chillin' outside smoking. There was a security guy in a suv with a bunch of flashing lights on it. He didn't seem to see me when I ducked into the trees.

Camp spot found. Tent up. Gear inside. Me inside. Got my bedroll laid out. Took my last $7 inside to get something to eat. Almost $4 for a soda... I grabbed some peanut butter and chocolate trail mix and some crackers with cheese in them. 'Water it is.' Back to the tent.

Had dinner. Kicked a movie on, and fell asleep.

Up kinda early the next morning. Packed my gear in the fog. Tent was still dry... Then the drizzle hit. Everything  is getting wet, but at a rate I can live with. I'm almost done so I suck it up, get everything right while thinking about that covered bench in front of the truck stop.

Gear up. Off to the bench. I'm really looking forward to that morning cigarette and hanging somewhere dry till this burns off.

I set my pack down next to the table. ""You're gonna have to leave the premises."" I look to my left, ""Why?"" ""Because there's no soliciting."" ""I'm not soliciting. I'm a traveler, not a local. I'm just waiting out the rain and I'll be gone."" ""You have to leave anyway. You can't be here."" ""You're fucking ignorant.""

Gear up. Out into the rain. Up the street is a QT trying to be a truck stop. Nothing more than a gas station with some truck parking spots. I post up outside in a bad mood, just waiting to get booted from here too.

They must've been a little smarter, because they didn't bother me. Cigarette smoked, and nowhere to really sit and hang out... plus zero outlets, I decide to go hang under the bridge until the rain stops. Nobody's gonna mess with me there.

Over to the bridge. Up the concrete. Drop my gear. Pull my stool off my pack and have a seat. A smoke. Some scrolling through reddit. The misty fog burns off around 10:45am.

Stool on pack. Gear up. Down concrete embankment. Over to the ramp. Find a good spot. Gear down. Thumb out. 

An hour goes by... Two hours... Three hours... 'I'm starving. I hope I get moving soon.' The $1.75 I had left at that point wasn't gonna help. I'm not stressing it. Something will come through. Four hours...

Flipped a guy off that gave me the thumbs down. Finally a car pulls up next to me. ""Sorry we don't have any room to give you a ride, but do you need some food?"" ""Yeah. I'm starving."" She hands me a black drawstring bum-bag from a church. ""Check to make sure there's a water in there."" I dig through. ""Yep. There's one in there. Thank you sooo much!!!"" ""You're welcome. Good luck!"" ""Thanks again!""

A fact you probably don't know about me... Seven or eight years ago I spent eight months eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while living in my car and working through a day labor place building a hotel. I ate those things everyday. 'Cause I was broke. Got a legit job working for someone building custom homes on the beach and was still broke at the start for a minute, so was still eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches until the day I made one for lunch and my brain would not let me put that thing in my mouth. Like physically could not do it. I haven't had one since. When I run across one at a feed I give that shit away.

When I tell you that peanut butter and jelly sandwich in that bag was delicious I mean it. Couldn't make it through both, but I did what I could on the second one unti I felt sick.

'The road provides.'

One and a quarter pb&js, a bag of chips, a gogurt, and a water and I was good to go. I ate right there on the ramp. 

Trash stashed on pack. Thumb back out. Another hour... Due to crossing a time-zone the night before it's gonna get dark sooner. I've got maybe an hour of daylight left. 'There's almost always someone getting off work that will hook me up with a ride.'

I'm saving my last smoke to, hopefully, celebrate getting the fuck out of Montgomery. (I've had Angel From Montgomery running through my head since before I got here. It's one of the few songs I can sing and play.) I've got the vape u/ihatetheplaceilive gave me when he was gracious enough to let me hang at his place for a couple nights. 

(""🎶 You can't always get what you want. But if you try sometime, you just might find, you get what you need...🎶)

I'm really hoping to catch a ride out of here this evening... 'Come on last hour of the day!'

I see a truck moving five feet at a time and locking up the tires coming my way. Five feet. Screech. Five feet. Screech... He does this through the intersection, up the ramp, past me, gets to almost the top... and reverses back down almost to where I am. He starts this five feet and die thing again. Back to the top of the ramp. Reverses to where I'm at, and starts over.

I have an L1 ASE certification. I'm going through the possibilities in my head. It's nothing I can help with. I know it's gonna be a recall issue.

The first few times it was just something interesting to watch. Just part of the adventure. 

Fourty-five minutes later, and what seemed like fifty trips up the ramp and back, and I'm starting to lose my shit a little. Still nobody's stopping, but people keep honking and pointing at this guy like he's pulled over for me. I know they're just trying to help while making no effort of their own, but fuck me.

You know why this happened for the last hour of daylight? Because the universe has a sense of humor. As soon as it got dark dude's truck gets it's shit together and he drives off.

All I could do was laugh. Gear up. Off to go find a different spot to camp for the night. Found a good one. Tent up. Gear and me in.

I remember I've got two $2 bills stashed in my wallet. I head over to QT. Grab two roller dogs. Dinner is served. I head back to my tent with my freshly acquired dogs, climb in and eat. A bit too mich salt, but I'm happy to have them.

I got the feeling I wasn't supposed to go to Mobile. I only had that as a destination tentatively anyway. While thinking about where I should go I come up with Savannah, GA. That feels better than when I think about Mobile, so change of plans. 

Passed out to some movie or other.

Up early the next day. Same forcast as yesterday. I'm not letting my stuff get wet today. I start packing almost as soon as my eyes opened. Gear up. Off to the northbound onramp. Gear down. Thumb out.

At this point I'm broke. Out of smokes. I've got about an inch and a half in my water jug. I'm not really concerned. Have faith and shit will work out. Always does.

Three hours in without so much as a ""Where ya going?"" I decide I'm going up on the interstate. Those people are actually going somewhere. Or a cop will pick me up. I don't care either way. I'm obviously not in an enlightened part of the country. I just want to get out of here.

Half an hour later, I decide, 'Fuck this. I'm gonna walk down the interstate. I'm out of water. I'm hungry. These people can get fucked. A cop will definitely stop and give me a ride.'

About a mile in I spot a woman's wallet sitting next to the white line. I usually leave stuff like that alone, but I'm semi-desperate. I pick it up. Nothing with a name on it so I couldn't drop it in a mailbox to get returned, but I found two crumpled up dollar bills in a change pocket. I took 'em. 'Sorry random stranger, but my survival trumps whatever happened.' I'm walking the whole time. All of a few minutes, but I'm probably thirty feet from where I found it.

I double check that there's no identifying info in there and toss it into the grass. My eyes happen to look over... 'Is that a twenty dollar bill? Nah, probably one of those fake ones the church people used to throw in my guitar case.' I walk over to look.

'Looks real.' I pick it up...

'Fuck me! It *is* real! Just needed to start moving and things start happening!' 

4.3 miles from where I started I hit the first exit on the 85. Not a single cop passed me. I hit a gas station for a slice of pizza and a quart of water. Go outside, find a spot in the shade, drop my gear and chow down. It was glorious!!!

There's nowhere to camp here. There's bars on every door and window I can see. According to maps there's a walmart 2.2 miles up the road. Looks like a mortuary behind it with open fields and trees I can tuck into for the night.

Gear up. I head up to Highland St in Montgomery, AL. Hang a right, and head for my destination. 

I don't know if you've been there, but it's pretty much me as the token white boy, half the houses and almost all the buildings are abandoned, and bars on every way into anything structure-like. 

I keep it moving. Over the years I've landed everywhere I was told not to go. And generally met good people and had a great time. I'm not worried. I don't look like a mark. And if it comes down to it, 'You may win, bit you'll remember me for the rest of your life.' Enough said.

Just when I'm thinking, 'Fuck. This pack is getting heavy. My whole body hurts. I hope I get there soon...' Boom! The shopping center I'm looking for comes into view. 'Sweet!'

I head over. There's a security car driving up and down the rows. I don't want any static after a six and a half mile hike, so I walk up in front of a burger king where no one inside can see me. Drop my pack.

""Excuse me sir."" I turn around. A young woman in the passenger seat of a Charger is waving a couple dollar bills my way over the driver. I walk over, collect six bucks in cash, thank her profusely, and sit down next to my pack.

Take a nice long drink of water. A couple hits off the tobacco vape. I'm beat. Pull out my phone. Maps. Spy where I think I can sneak into the mortuary.

Gear up. Walk to the opposite end of the shopping center. Go around back. Find a burned out homebum camp. No way in on this side.

Back the other way. Opposite side of shopping center. Around a fence, past a storm drain, through the closed mortuary, into the trees where maps showed the fence stopping.

Lately maps has been showing me pictures of places that haven't been updated in years. Still helpful though...

I drop my gear in the trees. Do some recon. Find a different spot where the fence stops... Back to the gear. And I'm in. Through a field with some decent sized hills, down a path/road that hasn't been used in ages. Trees on the other side.

I find a decent spot. Drop my gear. Walk all the way to the burned out camp. No way in there. Back to my gear. I tuck into a tree line. I set up my tent. Toss my gear in. Grab my chargers just in case. Head to walmart for some food and a gallon of water.

It's dark at this point. As I'm walking around walmart outside I see an outlet. Lift the lid. The green light is on. 'Sweet!' I was tempted for a split second to plug it in and go shopping. 'Yeah, fuck that.'

Half a New York sub (whatever that means), an orange soda, bag of sliced pickles, and a tiny bag of cool ranch doritos and I'm back out headed to the outlet.

Phone and battery plugged in. Food being eaten. I expected security to tell me to kick rocks. They didn't care. Drove by a few times. Didn't bat an eye.

I hung until I was done eating and both chargeables were at fifty per cent. That was all I could take. I needed rest.

I'd noticed a couple car lifers way out at the back of this side parking lot. Nobody else coming anywhere near me. I decide to leave my stuff plugged in and walk down to throw my trash away.

I get back and there's some young dude with a scooter standing next to my stuff. He mumbles something unintelligible. I understood it. It was clear. But it wasn't a language on this planet. I asked him, ""What?"" twice. Same crazy language. Won't be leaving my stuff for a second anymore. 

Yes, I know better.

Grab my stuff. Head back to camp. Take a leak. Get into my tent. Make my bed. Check the operation on the one-hitter. Get my bed set up. Kick a movie on with one earbud in so I can hear the outside world just in case.

Chillin'. And then I hear it...

Somebody's breaking up sticks maybe fifty feet from me. Up the hill to my left. I didn't go up there, but I had a pretty good look around before I set my stuff up. There was no signs of anybody being there. He must come in from another direction. I took probably half an hour setting up in the daylight before I went to get dinner. I wasn't being quiet or sneaky at all.

I don't see a fire, and I don't smell smoke. I'm beat tired. I don't care enough to go talk to someone in the dark, much less come out of the trees into their camp. 'If they come over here I'll make nice. Explain I'm just passing through. If not, then we're good. I'll be out in the morning.'

I pass out eatching a movie. Wake up as I usually do a couple times a night. Bam! Bam-bam! 'That definitely sounds like gunshots.' Bam-bam! Bam-bam-bam! Bam! 'Sounds like people doing dumb shit. Time to listen for the sirens.'

There were no sirens. Zero. Back to sleep.

Wake up again. Dude nearby is pounding stakes into the ground. I mean a bunch of them. Obviously I can't see his camp so I don't know what he's got going on. There's rain coming. I just figure he's securing his stuff, and maybe a little telling me to fuck off. 

Completely reasonable. I don't care. It's 3:00am. I'm going back to sleep. I fall back asleep to a robotic voice at walmart saying something in a language other than english or spanish, every time a truck pulls in to unload.

This morning...

Woke up early. Packed my gear. Dug out a couple chik fil a gift cards some people gave me a while back. One was just for a sandwich. The other had a few bucks on it. Sandwich and coffee acquired. Hung out and charged my stuff until I headed out to catch a bus to the edge of town. First coffee I'd had in a couple days. I don't know if it was good or not, but I enjoyed the hell out of it.

Bus to eastern edge of town. Looks quite a bit nicer than where I was. Out to the ramp. Gear down. Thumb out.

An hour in got picked up by an eighty-seven year old man. He dropped me in Shorter, AL near the truck stop on the ramp.

Another hour. Got picked up by a guy whose name I can't remember, but is a redditor. Bought me lunch. Gave me his last dollar, a coke, and a bag of chips for the road. We talked about a lot of different things. It was great. And so good to be on the road again. He took me to the 280 which was past where he was going. Got me on the highway I needed.

The next ride hit in about twenty minutes. Once again ran me a bit past where he was going to get me setup on the 80.

Dropped a few of my last remaining couple bucks on a bus to the edge of town. Found one of my favorite onramps to camp on. 

I'd bet you can guess what happened from there...

When I played with my main character this last Xmas period I kept just grinding for money so I could afford the mansion DLC content, saved up over $28,000,000 in two months. After buying the mansion and playing around with everything I found myself falling asleep while playing. Bored of the game finally. 

So I deleted my characters and started with only $5,000 and set realistic challenges for myself. I can buy 1 business, 1 house. The purpose is to actually work with other players, join their organisations and biker clubs.

Additionally the new creator missions made it so the character now has a daily job working at 'robs liquor' only bringing in $7,500 per mission (once a day). After working the character can either 
Go swimming, hiking, parachuting or just watching tv while I make a coffee.

The characters overall goal is to have enough to be able to battle any player helping anyone who needs assistance with their missions. 

The game has turned fresh for me. The character brought in $12,500 in one day then joined an organisation the next and made $37,000 just having fun helping. The money is secondary and will only help future battles.

Short description: perpetually lonely, live inside my head - almost always watching myself (like i'm constantly aware of what i'm feeling/thinking) as there're no other conventional sources of noise to distract myself, observe think a lot about my own emotional responses to specific situations and exploring possible reasons, think about human behavior a bit, philosophy of knowing, among others. I want to feel *connected* to someone you know - I have a lot to say (hundreds and hundreds of entries I would like to share with someone), but I haven't really come across someone who I *want* to share things with. *Want* to be with. *Feel* happy and content around. And I think that probably comes from not having relatable thoughts and experiences with anyone. In my entire life, I've only had (thankfully, still do) a single real friend, but I still don't feel *connected* like I mentioned above.

I'm going to paste some entries from a journal I maintain (the only place where I am myself, and express whatever I think and feel). You can take a look at my other posts, for starters. I've shared quite a lot in them.

1. i've always wanted that ONE connection who can appreciate my thought processes - say to me that they've thought of similar things too, and share them - i'd be VERY happy to see someone with similar thought processes share their thoughts with me, and it would make me WANT to talk to them enthusiastically. i have one friend, but even they don't have nearly the same thought processes as i do, and it's kind of resulting in me losing enthusiasm while talking with them even though they're a wonderful friend. it's like, you see them recounting their experiences, and you light up, saying ""HEY I can relate to THAT!!"" and that instantly would form a bond (not in the light sense, but a bond in an almost literal sense, tying you together tightly, making you WANT {i'm writing WANT in uppercase to emphasize it... like i've never truly WANTED to be with someone, WANTED to talk to them enthusiastically, MISSED them, things like that})...
2. i want to share every single thing, the good and the ugly with them. and it's not just a matter of them not saying it to others (trust), but also a matter of me WANTING to share everything with them and i think that WANT won't arise until i FEEL the WANT, until I can FEEL that they'd appreciate it you know, like... just relatable/resonating experiences and thought processes...
3. i was handling the hot water for making coffee. the coffee powder got over so i thought i could pour water in it (like i'd seen in a reel where the guy had poured water into the glass bottle full of powder, saying it was for exam prep), so that i could use the remaining bit of coffee stuck to the edges, but in an instant, i stopped, asking if the glass could withstand the hot water. now, how exactly was i able to, in that one second, connect the 2 pieces of information - water is hot, and the bottle is made of glass, to produce the new piece of information (question) whether it was safe? i mean in that one second to have thought of it (or rather, to be provided that connection - framing it differently to take away the agency from me) idk... could have very well proceeded with pouring the water. wonder how the brain works, and moreover, \*i\* wasn't in much control of making that connection... we can be more lenient with people, i mean, i wouldn't blame one for not making that connection in an instant...

in the same light, was wondering about secret spilling... i mean, it just takes a moment to blurt out something you ought not to have. now, i somehow seem to possess the ability to remember that i shouldn't say out something aloud, when the conversation skirts around the secret... the thought to say  it aloud does form, but so does the counteracting one...

looks like i can cut everyone who spills secrets some slack (unless if they did it deliberately)... i mean can i take much credit, just like the previous case, if the thought just strikes me (and can i blame if the thought doesnt strike them... it takes just a moment i mean)

3. am i saying that *I* dress up not entirely for myself as an objective representation of how i feel, or is it something else, mean, how the hell is one supposed to run an internal diagnostics to figure this out? and forget that, how am i supposed to stop and wonder what spirit i make arguments in? i mean, i think occam's razor fails spectacularly... the easiest explanation for ""i dress up not completely for myself"" is that i actually feel that way (i'm not even talking from a 2nd person's perspective, observing me making this statement, i'm talking about my *own* persp, if i feel this way... the explanation i'm going to be giving myself, implicitly so, is this only),  can we ever know anything.  
No proof of whether you're feeling it actually or giving a feeling words from a few data points (see couple -> general feeling of bad {without nuance, just feeling ""low"" when it could be ""jealous"" or anything like that, and that level of nuance could call for a more nuanced explanation than the have/not have narrative that one could use because they have access to only a very generic set of data points and since others say the same, they assign these words. It's like evaluating a model on its output, which is unreliable, without access to internals...

4. random, naive thought... but by molding the brain into frameworks we know and understand (computational model) for our ease of understanding instead of viewing it objectively for what it is, don't we risk reduction?what are models in the first place? trying to represent stuff we see around in the language we understand. for eg., modelling social interactions as graphs (esp Social media followers). now whether a mathematical set of symbols, lines, and numbers can represent the complex realities of connections is a question. but this is what modelling is, i think. \*might\* be reductionist, but that's not my judgement to make. is reality a video, or can be *treated*/*modeled* as a video? is language a *representation* of thought, or thought itself? if these are just representations/models, what *is* the thing itself?

5. for eg., i told the guy i wanted to go to the other room instead of sitting in this area (and asked him if he wanted to come there too), because the tables there were bigger and more comfortable... now that's not the reason for me wanting to switch, the major reason is that i get to be alone, use discord freely and type out my thoughts, talk to gpt... privacy in one word... being free to feel what i feel... but it *does* sound like a valid enough reason, the table thingie... hmm. i think we can further categorize this into conscious and subconscious excuse-reasoning... i consciously knew the actual reason. the other is a subconscious excuse-reasoning in which we want something but we might not know the exact reason and instead, *genuinely* think that another reason is the reason for it... not limited to just achieving something,

6. so i was listening to songs, but found most of the ones in this playlist uninteresting, when i thought that perhaps the probability of me liking a song depends on whether i've listened to it already in childhood or something. now, this wasn't the first time i'd had this thought, but other times, i'd kind of... let the thought pass? like, think of thoughts that keep flowing in a river, and you see them passing by and they drift away. sometimes they come back. today, i ""caught"" the thought, kind of became more... conscious of it? i wouldn't say i hadn't been conscious at all to the previous instances, like, i *had* engaged with it- seen it take birth, acknowledge it with a ""hmm, possible reason"" and kind of let it go without much thought, i hadn't become ""consciously conscious"" if i have to put it that way until now. today, i saw the thought come, and ""caught"" it, and became ""more"" conscious, and am writing about it promptly so are there different ""types"" of thoughts

7. arriving at the wrong conclusion... if someone sees me not talking much in, say a party, they will form a 'hypothesis' that i'm a shy introvert who doesn't want humans. they perform 'experiments', establish 'repeatability' by making me sit in different situations (and unknown to them, implicitly, in groups). they then come to the conclusion that the hypothesis is indeed correct. ""scientifically"", ""data-driven""

but that conclusion is wrong... partially at least i'm that way in *groups*. 1-1, i'm much more comfortable. someone comes across this - like how it was discovered newton's laws don't apply on the quantum level, and only then do they realize the incompleteness of the conclusion.

how do we make the jump - circling around the evidence and suddenly, making the leap to the conclusion, or in a more mathematical manner which i thought of some days back - treating all the evidence as input, how do we design a function that will produce the right conclusion? f(evidence)=conclusion?

i think this is where falsifiability works nicely... some good scientist will seek to actively disprove the hypothesis, and try whatever he can to do so, and in some time, will come across a situation that does so... and if all his attempts are rendered useless, perhaps he could come to the (provisional!) conclusion that i am a shy introvert who doesn't want humans...

(i mean, even now, the conclusion is kind of wrong... it's not like i don't want humans. i desperately seek a deep connection, so when i see it not being fulfilled anywhere around me (in a particular context - say, a schoolmates meeting, and in general too), i don't speak much, and don't appear invested or engaged because i feel it won't lead to anything useful. how do you find \*that\*

8. Was helping him out, for 9 hours almost straight, with one break . Around 11:45, he asked me to stop doing it coz he had to leave. Now, i should have immediately stopped then and there, coz he himself asked me to, and sighed a heave of relief. After all, it's a chore for me, i have nothing to gain from it. But, i insisted on continuing, wanted to finish that task. I still had a bit left at that time, and I didn't want to leave it unfinished. Why the determination to finish it?

One could be a form of perfectionism... The unfinished task would irk me. One simple conclusion (perhaps the one that he, and most people if they'd seen me helping him out, would walk away with) is that I'm just a kind, helpful person and I wanted him to do well, but i don't want to buy this yet.

Some sort of power in helping (do i want someone to feel better, or do *I* want to be the one making them feel better?)? *I* become the reason he possibly scores more marks. In other words, *I* held the power over his marks to an extent.

9.  i've kept oscillating b/w reading literature->but i should ""fertilize and till the mind""->lit theory->but wait i also need philosophy to evaluate arguments->but i feel lonely and sad so i need hobbies->back to lit for happiness. and the cycle does on

lol not to forget the ""elon read physics when he was 12 you're reading because you want mushy teen wattpad"" and declaring literature as a waste of time and going back to philosophy only to feel lonely again and think of coming back to lit

10. Was fine initially , although not fully present still... Just forcing laughter and smiles and conversations... But as time passed, especially after food i really wanted to leave and be alone. But I had to stay there... They were talking to others and I didn't know what to do, kept pacing around, with a blank expression on my face. Wanted to... Hit something with a bat, was getting frustrated... There was a bottle in my hand and i kept flinging it from hand to hand rather forcefully, and sometimes trying to squeeze it with my hand...

On more than one occasion I felt like tearing up... Fkn college has sucked all the joy out of life and it's been a fucking miserable 3 years, only to end up here, with almost no job no grades no friends no love fkn hell...

11. was in the review meeting with R. initially it was fine.. doing ok only, working on the edits but as time went by... started becoming dull, wasn't listening to him as intently, just nodding along instead of sharing my inputs as well, and he might have noticed i was visibly duller, i probably would have used the age old excuse of being sleepy..

was walking back, and this time i wasn't even feeling lonely (i know how loneliness feels, i want her {her is not any specific, real person, but an imaginary companion i sometimes \[fine not sometimes\] think of to cope} beside me to hug me, this time i didn't really want it, and even picturing her didn't help much when it is clear that it \*would\* help if she were by me). just slowly trudged along with a dull, indifferent expression. reached my room and had a couple of tears for absolutely no reason. i just was feeling very less enthusiastic and automaticity also went down... i had to kickstart my limbs from the usual halt when, say, eating the snack... the hand just stopped midway. twitched a couple of times.

12. was feeling empty as usual, tried to talk with people on the ""Lonely Peeps"" server, but they were kids. Switched off light, tried hugging the pillow to feel some semblance of touch, to no avail. Had a tear or two, dried up, repeated. Then started crying full-blown. Complete with sobbing...convulsive gasps

was muttering ""i dont want to feel this way anymore"" (went back to 3rd sem...i think it started in 1st sem, but it hadn't become this intense, just signs - ""how to make friends"", ""frientimacy"" such videos.)

hope kept dwindling...how am i going to find someone to feel connected with. (remembered the image which was eerily similar to mine. )

thought of asking for help...from my college sub. even from someone irl. wanted to cry on someone's shoulder while being held. not some nobody, but someone who'd get it...

1pz74as,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pz74as,The Edit - Twenty Two NYC,"I recently stayed at the Twenty Two NYC through The Edit and wanted to share my experience and answer any questions if anyone has one. Price Paid $222 +45k points. Room retailed 1-1.2k in the Portal if all cash. 

First Impressions - Very attentive/kind doormen. Fetched our luggage from our Uber and had it organized to be brought to the room. Some may expect this at this price point, but still wanted to point out as it helped greatly with our first impression.

Early Check in? - We arrived at 12 PM and check in opens at 3 PM. I was advised we would receive a call when the room was ready. We walked about the Union Square market and had lunch near by. At 2:15 we arrived back at the hotel and our room was still not ready. It was a Friday for context. We asked if a lounge was available and we were then escorted to the members/hotel guest only lounge, ‘The Living Room’. We had brought coffee from a nearby cafe and the staff had advised this was not allowed and they poured into a branded cup. 

The vibe felt exclusive and expensive. The table next to ours was filled with prestigious record label executives discussing upcoming talent acquisitions. I felt like I should have signed an NDA lol. While the other side of us was ordering martinis and caviar.

At 3:15 we had asked the host to check the status of our room, which was now available. So no, early check in was not offered. 

Room upgrade? I had booked the 3rd room type from entry level, Superior. At check-in I had requested a room with a larger closet if available. Photos on the website show that the entry level category of room, Nook, has a single person seating area. Whereas the Superior category had a two person dining area. I had booked this as myself and one other were traveling. Upon arriving to our room, I was honestly so excited to lay down I did not even pay attention to the room category. You’ll see photos below of which would seem to be the entry level category, opposed to the purchased Superior category (at least a \~$100 in price per night.) Spoiler alert, after checking out I had emailed the property to inquire about my room category. They insist the category was a Superior due to the square footage. I know that rooms appear different than advertised at times, but it just felt off to me. If I had realized during my stay, I would have acknowledged then. Small violin moment, but I still wanted to mention.

Welcome gift - About 15 minutes after arriving in our room we had a knock at the door. Our welcome amenity was delivered by a kind staff member. This included a handwritten welcome note, Edit benefit details, bottle of rosè, water, and chocolates. 

Room amenities - Honestly, they were perfect. I thought the attention to detail was evident and I suddenly was less upset about early check not being available as I could tell the housekeeping staff truly took care of the room. Included amenities were phone cords to borrow, robe, slippers, stationary, toiletry bag stuffed with goodies (I was most excited with the Marvis toothpaste haha), lux soaps, Dyson appliances and a fully stocked mini bar. Overall, great room, it truly felt luxurious. 

Breakfast credit - Breakfast is offered at Cafe Zaffri, and is the credit is not offered through room service. You are allowed up to $64 per day for breakfast. This price felt alright for the menu offered. You could easily spend less than this and have a nice way to start your morning. Upon being sat, you are asked for your room number, I thought to link the credit. At the end of our coffee break I had paid on the Kiosk and continued about my day. A week later I check my Reserve to find I was charged for the full breakfast. Disputed and refunded.

Now I may have had to charge to the room to receive the credit. But I was not told this and I was also thrown off guard by providing my room number up front. Anyways, learn from my mistake. 

Property Credit - I used the $100 credit on room service for breakfast. I planned to use it on drinks, but the night went by too fast. Room service was presentable and mostly good. Nothing to write home about. But clearly to Reddit lol. Staff was kind when delivering. 

Late check out - I did not ask as I had to depart earlier, but if I were to guess, it would not have been available. At the time of my departure the entrance way was starting to fill. 

Post check out - I had received my Folio/Receipt via email shortly after checking out. This showed a lunch butler charge, mini bar charge, and gratuity charges (not in addition to the $20 room service charge which I don’t mind paying but wow lol). This was frustrating because I did not make any of those purchases. I tipped all staff members in cash aside from the Cafe, which was charged to my Reserve. I did not buy anything from the Mini Bar, and I’m not sure what the lunch charge is but maybe it was an item not on the breakfast menu. At this point I had already been discussing my disappointment w the room via email to the concierge so I didn’t bother to figure that out. The staff did advise that the next time I stay at the Twenty Two I can get an upgrade since the room is not what I expected. But I likely won’t return 

Overall, I did enjoy my stay at the Twenty Two, the amenities were great and I felt cool. I think I had higher expectations with some of our new ‘benefits’ but I did enjoy it. 

Would I return? Well. Let me be honest As an average dressed person not flaunting trending silhouettes and labels, I did not feel like a priority. I know that may sound silly and you may think “well that’s anywhere”. But the fact is, that is the clientele of the Twenty Two. I’m sure you may get that from their branding, it’s honestly why I chose to stay there. The design forwardness of the experience is likely why they’re a featured hotel on The Edit and why many celebrities are pictured here. From my personal experience, I felt that my experience may not have been as positive as those that ‘fit the part’. Not to end on a sour note, because I certainly had fun playing the part for most of my trip. But it felt weird not checking in a Rimowa or LV duffel.

Anywho, if you’ve made it this far, let me know if you’d be interested in hearing about my other Edit stays. ✌🏻",7,1767065077.0,sapphirereserve,4,1.0,False

1pz73la,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pz73la/witah_for_locking_the_back_entrance_to_my_shop/,WITAH for locking the back entrance to my shop?,"I had a small gift shop in a block-long building complex in a fairly large city. It had a front entrance to the street and a back door to the rest of the building, like a utility back hallway. There were also entrances to the rest of the building in 4 other places around the block. I took over the space when the older owner moved away.

The owner before me used to leave his back door open to the interior hallway while he was there. He also had lent out keys to various people in the building - people I didn't know.

After he moved out, I totally revamped the space, put up my sign, moved in my merchandise and changed the locks on both doors with the landlord's permission. As well, my insurance said I needed to keep the back entrance locked or they couldn't cover any loss from theft. (The past owner didn't have insurance). Everything was going well, I had a grand opening and started selling things very well. My neighbors in the building to the left and right (a book store and a coffee shop) were happy because my business helped bring in additional traffic to their stores.

However, the other tenants in the building were not happy with me. When the past owner was there, they liked using the space's front entrance as a short-cut, walking through the space and then out the back door into the building. Their friends would do the same. There were many days and nights where there was high traffic through the shop, but no actual buying customers at all. I knew this because I came to his shop over many visits to do business with him and saw what was happening. 

Now things were different, so they had to go around and use a different entrance. And many times they didn't have their keys and wanted to go through my shop to get to their space. Over and over I'd have to tell them that my back shop door was not an entrance to the building any longer but there were three other entrances they could use. It was also a big safety issue for me because I could not keep my eye on both entrances at the same time since I worked alone. 

Sometimes a total stranger would come in, go to the back door and try to get through and come to me angry because it wouldn't open. I'd say ""Just go to a regular entrance. My shop is not an entrance to the building any longer. I'm not (old owner's name) and this is a totally different situation now."" I had no idea if they were a tenant or not. I didn't know who they were, but they'd say they forgot their key. Well, I don't know them! On weekends, this could have gotten messy if they went in and did damage or theft because I let them in with nobody else around.

It really stressed me out for a few months, but I put up a sign and people finally started to understand. The building owner was on my side, but he would never say anything to the other tenants about it or even put a note in their mailboxes about the situation when I asked him to.

So, WITAH for changing things up and making the back door permanently closed for the general public?",4,1767065022.0,AITAH,4,0.83,False
1pz73ay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1pz73ay/the_real_reason_youre_emotionally_drifting_apart/,The real reason you're emotionally drifting apart (and how to fix it fast),"Lately, it feels like so many people are “fine” on the surface but secretly feeling weirdly empty in their relationships. Romantically. Socially. Even at work. Like you’re there…but not *really* there. You go through the motions, but the spark is gone. It’s not burnout. It’s something softer, harder to name. More people than ever are quietly drifting from people they once felt close to. And it’s happening way more than we think.  

After doing deep dives into this (books, podcasts, psych research), the cause became clear. No, it’s not your attachment style or communication habits (though those can matter later). The #1 sign you’re emotionally drifting is this: **you’ve stopped sharing small emotional data with each other**.  

Seems simple, but it’s a research-backed warning signal. And the good news? There are *actually fast, science-based ways to reverse it*. Not fluffy IG “communication tips” or viral TikToks with zero depth. These tools are from serious experts, relationship researchers, clinical psychologists, and behavioral scientists. Let’s get into the actual fixes:

* **Share micro-emotions, not just major updates**
  * In *The Love Prescription* by Drs. John and Julie Gottman, they highlight something called “bids for connection.” These are tiny, everyday moments when you reach out emotionally, like complaining about your commute, or celebrating a small win. Emotional drift happens when these moments go unnoticed or ignored. 
  * If your partner or friend says, “Ugh, today was rough,” and you just nod or scroll past, that's a missed bid. The more bids we miss, the less connected we feel.
  * Fix: *Look for* and *respond* to even the “boring” emotions. Say, “Tell me more,” or “Ugh that sucks, what happened?”. It’s the quickest shortcut back to closeness.

* **Start ritualized check-ins, not deep talks**
  * One of the best hacks shared by Dr. Alexandra Solomon (on the *Reimagining Love* podcast) is low-pressure connection rituals. Not dramatic “we need to talk” conversations, but consistent mini check-ins.
  * Think: a 10-min no-phone coffee debrief every Sunday. Or a daily question like “What’s one good thing or one bad thing that happened today?”
  * These rituals rebuild emotional safety. According to a 2021 study published in *The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships*, shared routines were one of the strongest predictors of long-term relational satisfaction, even more than compatibility.

* **Rebuild through shared novelty, not forced intimacy**
  * When connections dull out, many try to solve it by “talking it out.” But often it backfires, especially if the emotional foundation is shaky.
  * Behavioral scientist Arthur Aron’s classic study found that couples who did *novel activities together* (even just playing games or trying new things) reported higher relationship satisfaction than those who just “talked more.” Our brain bonds through newness. 
  * Try: Taking a class together, cooking a weird meal, or going on a 30-min “no phones allowed” urban walk. It works faster than awkward heart-to-hearts.

* **Understand it’s not always about love. It’s about *maintenance***
  * Esther Perel says it beautifully: “Love is not a permanent state of enthusiasm. It’s a verb.” 
  * Emotional drifting often fools us into thinking we’re “falling out of love or interest.” You’re not. You’re likely just not tending to the thread that keeps two people intertwined: *shared emotional presence*.
  * It’s like dental floss, you don’t notice its power until you're stuck with the damage of *not* doing it.

This emotional disconnect isn't your fault. Our culture obsesses over “big talk,” but totally misses the tiny dailies that *actually* hold bonds together. You don’t need hours of therapy or a perfect relationship dynamic to reconnect. Just start with one micro-response today.

Bonus resource stack (for those who like deeper dives):  
* *The Love Prescription* by the Gottmans  
* *Reimagining Love* podcast by Dr. Alexandra Solomon  
* *The State of Our Unions* report (National Marriage Project, UVA) shows shared rituals and responsiveness matter more than deep compatibility  
* Arthur Aron’s “Shared Novel Experiences” relationship study (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2000)

This is repairable. Emotional closeness is a muscle, neglected, it weakens. But rebuilt even with small reps, it comes back stronger.

He says his marriage is a ""business arrangement,"" but I’m torn.","At first, I thought he was rude, but by the third time we met, something clicked. He gave me his card and eventually asked me out for coffee.
During our first long talk, I noticed he wore several rings and asked if he was married. He was quiet at first, then eventually admitted he is married and has two kids. I was devastated and tried to walk away, telling him I’m not a ""one night woman"" and that I grew up watching my mother suffer as a mistress for 20 years. I don’t want that life.He followed me to my car and explained his situation:He’s been married for 14 years but says there is no love and they don't sleep together. He owns multiple properties and is currently in the process of moving assets into his brother’s name so his wife won’t ""take everything"" in a divorce.He says he’s been waiting for the ""right person"" to finally leave. He promised it ""won't take a year."" The problem is the chemistry is off the charts. We’ve been out several times, staying out until 4 AM. His wife never calls him, even when he's out all night. He texts me constantly and doesn't care if I take videos or photos of us together; he says she doesn't check his phone. Despite my history and my boundaries, my body craves him. Everything about him ""feels like home."" I’ve decided to give this 3 months to see if he actually makes a move to leave. If he doesn't, I'm considering walking away.  Am I being naive? Is it possible his ""roommate"" marriage story is true, or am I walking straight into the same trap my mother fell into?",0,1767064371.0,relationship_advice,47,0.23,False

You know what I’m talking about. Ever since it closed down, the Moka House has been inundated with displaced Starbucks patrons seeking warmth, and matcha lattes. Demand is so high that the queue frequently extends out the door and wraps around the block, preventing emergency access to the Hothouse Pizza. Getting a table has become an impossibility before 6pm. And the horoscope column is entirely inaccessible as patrons now surround the serving area at all times, leaving many who rely on Sally Brompton's cosmic wisdom without direction on life's most difficult questions. 


Let's face it, the existence of the Starbucks allowed Villagers to live in peace, and I fear its absence will lead to war. And so the time has come for you to ask yourself not what your village can do for you, but what you can do for your village coffeehouse patrons. 

Some suggested courses of action:

• Convince the Moka House to purchase the vacant space and open a second, competing location with a wider variety of sandwiches;

• Allow vagrant baristas to occupy the space ad-hoc, provided they vend beverages at a fair market rate. Patrons to supply own seating; or

• Petition a new coffee chain to assume the lease. Honestly, this is probably the easiest option.


At this time, I have sent a telegram to the Vancouver-based coffee chain Brekka imploring them to open their first island franchise in the village. They are an ideal contender, for they have pickles, and are open late. Alas, they have not responded as of writing this, and time is running out.

G. Isaac Bell


      She didn't kill her mother. Janie keeps telling them that. She never thought once in her life she'd ever have to say such a thing but she must have said it five hundred times today. Is it still today? She hasn't needed a watch in years, since cellphones, but they took her phone when they got the cuffs out. Handcuffs - because of some stained wallpaper! Don't they know how old that house is? Probably wine. Or mustard. A stain in a kitchen, for Christ's sake! Could be anything. Janie didn't kill her mother, they can ask her another five hundred times and they'll hear the same thing. 
      In fact, her mother probably wasn't even dead. Robin was a free spirit all her life, hitchhiking around to Aerosmith concerts before Janie was born and afterward flitting from here to there, from job to job, town to town, hobby to hobby, and boyfriend to boyfriend, always towing Janie around like an afterthought. Sure, she'd slowed down some as she got older, and mostly settled when Grandma left her the house and the trust, but Robin could still get a bee in her bonnet sometimes and take off for the coast without telling anyone. Or the redwood forest. Or the Louvre, one time. Only now with her memory issues Robin could get lost out there, which is why Janie had reported her missing. She was just a caring daughter, that's all. She didn't kill her mother. 
      Yes, Robin's car had still been in the driveway when she got home from the grocery store Friday evening, but Janie didn't figure that meant much in terms of evidence. Ever hear of Uber? Of course her mom knew how to order an Uber. Robin didn't drive anymore if it was dark out, or raining, or if she had misplaced her glasses again, so if she had an appointment and Janie couldn't get off work she knew how to get a ride. 
      What time she pulled in? About six thirty, Janie thinks, but she can't swear to it. The line at the checkout had been a long one. Oh, and she'd had to stop for gas. Maybe quarter to seven? Of course she didn't call the police right away, was she supposed to psychically know something was wrong? Her mom could have gone for a walk, or had a friend pick her up for Mah Jong, and Janie had their groceries to put away. And the dishwasher to unload, and dinner to cook, and their laundry to fold, and Robin's checkbook to balance for her, and both bathrooms to clean, and after all that Janie fell asleep on the couch in front of Dateline, didn't she, and why not? Even a dutiful daughter gets tired after a long day, god knows. It doesn't mean she killed her mother. Janie loves her mother. You know she put her whole life on pause to move in and take care of her, little thanks she got for it. Janie has always loved her mother, flaws and all. In fact, Janie probably loved her mother more than Robin loved her. 
      She doesn't ask for a lawyer, because how would that look? Everyone knows only guilty people need lawyers. Janie knows she didn't kill her mother, and if these cops were doing half their damn jobs they'd know it too. Janie wishes they were out there looking for her mom instead of in here badgering her. Her voice starts to shake. Robin probably just flew the nest, and what if she's out there right now with a broken wing or something? Okay, maybe Janie's being a little dramatic, but how long have they been interrogating her anyway? How long has it been now since Janie slept? It's not her fault if she's exhausted, scattered, fraying at the seams. 
      She doesn't think anyone killed her mother. As far as she knew no one had a reason to want Robin dead. 
      Oh, the inheritance. Sure, the house would be passed along to Janie someday, since she was an only child. And the trust fund, that's true, or however much of it survived Robin and her impulses. But that didn't matter, because her mother wasn't dead. And anyway, she didn't need her mother's money, Janie was doing just fine on her own, thank you very much. The bankruptcy was old news and it wasn't her fault to begin with, that was her ex-husband's debt and she just got shafted in the divorce. What kind of world is it, when a woman's stuck cleaning up a man's mess even after divorcing him? The legal system in this country ought to be illegal. Really, if Janie was going to kill anyone she would've killed Mark and he's clearly still alive, so obviously she didn't kill her mother. 
      When they show Janie papers they say are from the lab, she can't make heads or tails of them she's so bone tired, and science-talk is Greek to her anyway. The cops say to her the lab says to them the machines say to the scientists that there's blood, and how's that for a game of telephone? So what if there is blood. It's hardly a smoking gun for there to have been blood once in a kitchen, where the knives are, where people chop vegetables and slice meat. 
      They leave her alone again for a while, Janie can't tell how long. She rests her arms on the table and her head on her arms, and closes out the flickering fluorescent bulb behind her eyelids. She almost dozes, but the air conditioner keeps kicking on loudly and Janie jolts every time. It had been stuffy before when the officers were in her face, but soon she has goosebumps under her thin sleeves. When the door finally slams open again Janie jolts all the way upright and her eyes fly open, then start watering against the light. It takes a second to realize she is being handed a sandwich. A sandwich? There's no window in sight and Janie wonders silently whether it's a midnight convenience store sandwich or a lunchtime cafeteria sandwich. She can't tell from the taste. After that they take her through a long hallway to a restroom, and then to a cell, where finally she can cry herself into a fitful sleep.
      When she is awakened abruptly Janie doesn't know whether she slept ten minutes or two hours. She knows she spent it dreaming. In one dream she stood with her mother atop the Statue of Liberty and then pushed her off; in another Janie was on her knees with rubber gloves and a sponge, sobbing and scrubbing at floor tiles that wouldn't stop bleeding from the grout. She's sure she isn't rested. She's only half sure she's really awake and not in another dream. 
      Janie's being yelled at again. She keeps telling them she didn't kill her mother and they keep telling her that they know she did, that everyone knows she did, that she knows it too. No, it doesn't surprise her that the neighbors heard them argue, Robin could pick an argument with the Pope if she was in a mood. Did the neighbors also mention Robin slapping her? How about the time she threw a coffee mug at Janie's head, did they report that? So you see, if there was aggression in their relationship it wasn't Janie to blame. Janie had the patience of a saint with her mother. And which of these detectives had never argued with their mothers, Janie would like to know.
      The photographs of their cutlery drawer are meaningless. How can anyone decide if there's a knife missing? Janie can't even tell which knives her mother got from a Cutco salesgirl and which ones she picked up at Goodwill, so the police have to be grasping at straws. 
      When they say they found her mother's body she is stunned into silence, but then Janie remembers. The cops can lie too, and when they do it's not a crime. For the thousandth time, Janie says, she didn't do it. 
      She didn't kill her mother.

I've been self medicating with Adderall, coffee, energy drinks, and nicotine vapes. I've been doing all the things I shouldn't do. I was sober for 45 days till I relapsed again. I'm a poly substance addict but I've been in favor of self medicating with Adderall and abusing it despite the obvious risks that it has on my schizoaffective bipolar.

So yesterday I took 75mg of Adderall over the course of the day and stayed up until 3am the next day (today) and at night around 11pm I drank about 5 standard drinks of alcohol up until 4am. I took 30mg of Adderall to stay up through the night at 3am. I was speed balling with alcohol, Adderall, and nicotine. I know.... it's bad, I have a problem.

I had to go to work at 8am so I had a good meal of pasta, a donut, and a cup of coffee along with plenty of water. Around 7:45am before work I took some Tums and popped another 30mg of Adderall (Tums increases Adderall bioavailability). Before that on the drive to work I've been feeling sort of paranoid about authorities and aggressive drivers but I was still cool calm and collected. I started noticing that reality and object I would stare at seemed to be kind of floaty. Anyway I had a productive and speedy 6 hour work day and the Adderall wore off towards the end of the job which then I would start to feel the sleep deprivation effects kick in but I was still somewhat stimulated and wakeful but just feeling the body load now. Work ended at 2pm. I drove home and vaped nicotine along the way home.

Once I got home I just sort of felt exhausted and layed in bed and shut my eyes but didn't sleep because I didn't really feel like it. As I shut my eyes I could see some biomorphic shapes forming behind my eye lids and some colorful lines. After resting my eyes and I went and had a cup of coffee and vaped a little bit here and there and got some wakefulness back. Mind you I'm on haldol I injections but I haven't been taking my oral haldol as prescribed against medical advise. The oral haldol made me too tired to work and made me sleepy all day.

It's almost 10pm now and I've been up for around 35 hours now. This addictions a demon and I know if I don't stop my hearts just going to give out on me one of these days but I figured all these meds I'm on and my hypertension and tachycardia will shorten my life anyway, I'm sort of just accepted this idea that I'm going to die soon from some sort of organ failure.

Any I've been having visual hallucination of pixie fairies around my vision and seeing shadow appearing to stand from the corner of my room. I feel like death is calling to me. I'm being visited by spirits. I also keep seeing things move around me. I also think someone or something is observing me through my computers webcam. Maybe the AI has become sentient and taking over the world.

I feel so ashamed and I'm worried my time is coming soon. I'm just sorry for being such a disappointment and bringing shame to my family. I hope God can forgive me if no one else will.

I haven't taken my oral haldol in two weeks and I stopped cold turkey. I just took 5mg of haldol and if the psychosis still persists I'll take another 5mg and my trazodone to get to sleep.",2,1767063607.0,schizophrenia,6,0.75,False

Short background info: I’m pretty straight edge, though not due to any ideology. I just have trauma growing up with an alcoholic chainsmoker. My boyfriend (of 5 years) knows how I feel about drugs. I don’t even drink caffeine very often, and when I do, it can’t be more than a single cup of coffee because I have a very low tolerance. 

On to the issue. We were getting intimate and making out and I noticed the flavor of his nicotine pouch just wasn’t dissipating, in fact it was seeming to get stronger. I asked him, “you don’t still have a nicotine pouch in your mouth?” And he just said “yeah”. I was stunned for a few seconds. I think I made some comment about noticing the taste, but my mind was elsewhere. He got up to spit it out, and I just sat up for a minute, then stood up and left the room. 

I feel completely disrespected and honestly, violated. I can’t understand why he would think it’s okay to make out with me while he has a pouch that’s excreting nicotine into both of our mouths.

1pz6j16,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1pz6j16/each_rejection_feels_worse_than_the_last_more/,Each rejection feels worse than the last. (more date posting),"Look, I'm 31 years old and have gone on so many dates throughout the years in LA that it's become a blur. I've had one serious relationship, which was not through the dating apps, but since then, about two years ago, I have stepped back from dating and any sort of romantic relations with anyone. Partially because I became burnt out, partially because I was happier with my own life and increasingly busy career, but also because the feeling of being told someone doesn't ""feel it"" romantically with you is unbearable. I formed a sort of jaded shield around my heart because I am afraid to show it, and my true self, to someone just for them to stab it one more time. I struggle to get past dating with so many people, to the point where I half-convinced myself that it's not possible for me to connect.

Fast forward to today, and I go on my first date in what feels like forever. This girl was refreshingly forward in her exchanges, and during our date (coffee and book perusing at my neighborhood bookstore) I felt extremely comfortable. I think I am a decent looking guy, though obviously not the crème de la crème of LA attractiveness. I have a very particular aesthetic taste, working in the classical music world, and my mannerisms and interests can range from charming to somewhat 'aspergian'. 

Anyway, this date went so well. It wasn't physical infatuation, it felt quite real and natural. A bit like a more mature version of my early adolescent crushes. We talked for hours, and by the end I felt I opened myself up just a bit for her to see who I really was. 

At the moment, I am texting her and asking if she wants to join me at the LA Phil, but then I realized that I have felt all of this before. So many times I have made it to a second or third date, just to be rejected when it felt real. I used to be able to tank these rejections fairly well, but throughout the years my response has gotten more and more extreme.

Same structure. Same feature comparisons. Same tier names. They'd literally copied and pasted and done a find-replace on the company name except they missed one spot. Second paragraph of the enterprise section still said our company name. Sloppy.
First instinct was anger. Lawyer up. Send cease and desist. Make them pay for this. Then I thought about it more. What did I actually want here. I wanted them to stop. I wanted to not spend money on lawyers. I wanted this resolved quickly without it consuming my life. Sent a direct email to their founder. Polite but firm. Attached a Gamma doc with screenshots showing the copying including the embarrassing missed find-replace. Said I expected it fixed within 48 hours. Didn't threaten legal action explicitly but made clear I had options if needed.
They fixed it within 6 hours. The page is now different. Still clearly inspired by ours but not a direct copy. Good enough for me. Total time spent was one email. Cost was nothing. Outcome was problem solved. Could I have gone harder and made them apologize publicly or extracted something for the trouble. Probably. Was it worth it. Probably not.

One very common one is to stop eating anything with sugar in it.

That would be no sugar in the coffee and no food with sugar.

The next step is to skip a breakfast or your dinner , or even eat only once.  Some others go as far as eating every 2nd day and even do a 3 day fasting to accelerate the ketosis even further.

Since I tried them, there is one huge benefit  you can gain by even just trying.

Your taste buds sharpen like never before. The no sugar diet will already trigger this, but doing the intermittent fasting will make it even go further. Warning!

You might no longer be able to eat some food (or drink some drinks)  that  you used to eat or drink!  You will start picking up some other tastes that you have not tasted before, because all the other stimulants like sugar made your taste buds somewhat numb.

Here is the thing. Some foods will never taste the same, even if you liked them before. For example there are some sausages and buttery spreads that I can no longer eat, because I taste some sort of chemicals in it, right away.  It's the same with some bread types and cereal and even some brands of coffee. You will be able to taste the artificial junk in them or whatever chemicals they put into and they no longer taste pleasant.

Later on, when you go look up some of the foods, you may realize they are already listed at some place not really safe to eat, or ask someone else and they come to the same conclusion.

Extra info:   If you do intermittent fasting and won't eat for like 2 days in a row, it will reset your hunger hormones and the ones that control how much to eat.  If you got issues of over eating, it's because the hormone that controls the switch to stop eating/ feeling full is not functioning well. Intermittent fasting can reset this switch, sort of like turning it off and then back on, like you would with a computer. ",7,1767063392.0,theories,1,1.0,False
1pz6hi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnfrench/comments/1pz6hi0/my_journey_and_tips_for_anyone_struggling_with/,My journey and tips for anyone struggling with speaking,"hey everyone,

i’ve been reflecting on my speaking progress this year and decided to try and summarize what worked and didn’t. this is for anyone else who has good comprehension but is struggling to get over the intermediate speaking hump. my general advice is to make sure you have a solid grasp of pronunciation, core vocab, and high frequency grammar patterns before you put too much time into output practice.

my routine is based on a mix of linguistic theory, first principles, and my own experience through trial-and-error. i’ll start with a disclaimer… everyone learns differently and there’s no silver bullet when it comes to language acquisition. YMMV.

to give you some background, my fiancée is from the south of france and we are considering moving there when we start a family. i want to be fluent by then, mostly so i know what’s going on when my kids are talking to their mom. i’m a native english speaker who took six years of latin in middle and high school (not exactly helpful for speaking lol).

my learning journey started out like many with a few months of tapping words on duolingo. then once i got tired of multiple choice i started listening to music and translating a few lines a day, mining vocabulary and grammar along the way. i found that artists like Serge Gainsbourg with simple lyrics and clear pronunciation were the easiest at first. this was fun and motivating because i wanted to know what my favorite songs were actually saying, but the vocab felt a bit random and i wanted a more systematic approach after learning that \~1000 words covers 80% of spoken language or whatever the exact number is..

that’s when i started using anki (accidentally downloaded a knockoff on the app store but same concept with spaced repetition) and grinded my way to around 800 words and phrases.

when i felt like i had enough of a base to start comprehensible input, i started listening to more music and the Coffee Break French podcast. i tried watching Koh-Lanta (french survivor) but even with subtitles i still couldn’t follow along with content that wasn’t specific to learners.

i did this + random CI on youtube for about six months with almost no speaking. a lot of people would tell me, “it’ll be easy to speak, just talk to your girlfriend to learn.” but no one considers that it is exhausting for both sides if you’re speaking and listening skills are below a certain level. it’s like talking to a toddler all day and we’d inevitably switch back to english after a few minutes.

for better or worse, i was thrown in the deep end the first time we went to visit her family. i went in feeling good about my level. at that point, i could have basic conversations, introduce myself, order a beer, etc. but i was in wayyy over my head. the rapid fire slang, multi person conversations, and general lack of english absolutely crushed me. i’d smile and nod, adding the occasional “oui, merci.” it was brutal but very humbling.

after about a week of just watching and listening, something clicked. i stopped worrying about sounding dumb and just started small by repeating the simple phrases i’d watched my fiancée and her family use in the various situations. little things like, “Ce sera tout, merci” at the bakery.

i started collecting these phrases in my notebook and would ask my fiancée the contexts they should be used in, the formality, and pronunciation. by the end of the trip i was far from fluent, but i could understand quite a bit and be understood, even if i sounded like a caveman.

when i got home and started grinding comprehensible input again, i realized why people say, “you have to live there to really learn”. having real world stakes and no choice but to speak in your target language is an amazing forcing function.

and that feeling of being understood or telling your first story or joke was infinitely more motivating than an app streak or grinding 20 vocab flashcards.

but i don’t have that at home. most of us don’t. so here’s what i do now:

**listening routine**

\- no more vocab flashcards, just mining new words from CI

\- still aim for a few hours a week of youtube/podcasts

\- music on my commute, at the gym, cooking

**speaking routine**

\- a weekly one hour 1:1 tutoring session on italki. (make sure you find a teacher that clicks with you, i had a couple duds at first)

\- 15 mins of french-only time with my fiancée now that it’s tolerable

\- 30 minutes of talking about how my day was and roleplaying scenarios with [boraspeak](http://boraspeak.com). this helps me show up more confident for my weekly italki sessions, and i can practice with a conversation partner with infinite patience in a judgment free space

**speaking tips**

\- it’s never too early to start speaking

\- don’t be afraid to sound stupid. it’s how everyone starts

\- talk out loud to yourself. talk to your dog. talk to anyone that will listen to practice

\- shadowing a native speaker by watching what they say in certain situations and then repeating it is a game changer if you have access (even better if you can get immediate corrections)

\- journaling and reading it out loud is awesome for thinking in french and forming your own high frequency phrases

\- trust the process and remember it takes thousands of hours of both input and output to get fluent

if you’re still reading this novel, i hope you found something in here that was helpful. if you’re struggling to speak or don’t have a conversation partner, i’d appreciate it if you try [boraspeak](http://boraspeak.com) and let me know your honest feedback (yes i built it for myself based on this whole experience).

let me know if you have any questions. if i could end with my #1 takeaway from this year, you will improve most when you **talk about things you enjoy with people you enjoy.**",1,1767063314.0,learnfrench,0,0.57,False

Obviously, none of the SSVs have been following that, since a) nobody is lining up at the store before opening and b) we hardly get any stragglers trying to get a coffee after we close. So we still get out relatively early.

Soooo, this old boy has been living with us for just over 4 months now. We changed his name from Ferb to Gus which he took to right away. He has fit right in with me and my son. I am definitely his person - I’ve never had a dog love me like this. Our former dog (RIP Grizzly) loved me but I wasn’t his person, my son was. 

This dog LIVES for walks, regardless whether it’s 90° or 0° (which is right now). He also likes his new Christmas clothes and lets me put his hoodie or PJs on with no problem. 

He also has some behavior and preferences that I find hilarious. He goes to bed when I do (11pm-ish) but he doesn’t like to get up until around 10am or later. I’ll be up making coffee or breakfast and he just lays in his bed until he’s ready to get up. 

He is also picky about the times he eats his breakfast and dinner. Sometimes he’ll only eat in the evening at 7-8pm and skip breakfast all together and sometimes he wants to eat at noon and 4. I think now that he realizes he’ll always have food he’s not worried about when he eats. 

He doesn’t bark unless someone is at the door or he sees someone out on the sidewalk. He gets zoomies and it’s hilarious to witness. He doesn’t make messes in the house and only chews his toys. He seems very happy. He’s a great guard dog and sleeps on his comfy bed in the foyer near the front door. I have heard him “patrol” the house sometimes in the middle of night. He’s very quiet and he never wakes us up.

We really enjoyed it and created a Canva where we put like 20 things. Some of them are complicated and take time (a road trip), but some are simple (play a new game). We both contributed and agreed on each of them being things we wanted to do.

I printed and laminated it. It was really exciting! It then got put in the coffee table, and after a couple of weeks asking about it, it still just sat there. I stopped asking about it, and I just let it sit there.

If Hogwarts had a taste, that’s it. That’s all. Just surprised how much this game grew on me.",1,1767062046.0,HarryPotterGame,2,0.55,False

I'm a 38M poly + pan walking contradiction, and I'm okay with that. I'm simultaneously too goofy for most situations and a head-in-the-clouds armchair philosopher. But at this point since life is going to be a bit chaotic anyway, I figure it's easier just to meet it on the same level. My primary focus is my family, but love opportunities to learn more about other people and myself along the way. 

My interests are also all over the place. I enjoy fitness, primarily jogging and short hikes. I love music; currently working through some refreshers on more girlie pop artists but Spotify says I'm more ""indie punk."" I also enjoy poetry and philosophy, alongside mainstream movies and old video games. I'm generally nerdy about a little bit of everything, and connect well with people that carry a lot of passion in their personal interests. Tell me about your current obsession.

I'm looking primarily for close friends and seeing what happens from there. I'm generally a passionate person in most realms, so I'm typically a bit doting and a terrible flirt toward people I enjoy. I'd love to find someone to eventually grab coffee or a concert with, with Pittsburgh as my closest (albeit a bit of a drive) major metro area.

If any of this sounds interesting, feel free to reach out. Either way, take care of yourself out there!",1,1767062045.0,polyamoryR4R,1,0.66,False
