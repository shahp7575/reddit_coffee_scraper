What came up was how beautiful a person my ex is.
My dad molested me as a toddler and it made me feel safe and yet sharply painful.
I don't wanna to be above anyone knowing what happened to my mom. I want to lift everyone above me. And that is tied to why I feel alone.
I want a relationship where we turn each other's hurt into healing. We respect, respond and sooth and talk through things. I want to be and with The Star personified.

I feel connection with ex rn. The deep love I have for her. It was the first thing that came up. I cried through the whole session and it felt good to cry.

I don't want to be above anyone. I hate the idea of having power over someone. I guess that too is why having power sexually makes me feel intimate. It's contradictory.

I feel extremely relaxed but God. I miss her. Being in her regard is like the first sip of coffee. I wish I could send her the energy I feel rn. I have nothing but love in my heart for her.

In the tangle of things she really is like that moment she described of find those queen of the night blooming on that tree. A person I will never hold again. I had a deep connection with you. It wasn't just a one off. It wasn't usury. It wasn't you or me in service to you or you to me. It was love at it's core.

It is always nice to make space for you. Like making a faery garden, or a cat house. You're a joy. I wish you'd understand that both can be true. I was drained and yet you were never too much. I would bleed for you and I bled myself dry. I was scared and yet you were the absolute of comfort.

Both are true. At least for me. I'm sorry working on our relationship felt like it'd be too hard on you or whatever reason it made you unhappy. It's hard to have grief really. It was a rare sight, you in my bed in the morning, beautiful as could be. But you are too scared to see the good. The bad is the truth.

Because I love and understand I won't chase you anymore. It won't do you any good. I will love and experience loss.

I hope you have a nice day. My next appointment is Friday and if it is anything like this it is exactly what I needed to get where my path is leading. Space. Time slowed. Tranquility. Acceptance. Surrender. Healing.

I felt myself as the star. It has been my goal for so long. Now I am Temperance but I seek deeper things. I'm in awe of the shifts in my brain. Peace.",1,1746036885.0,u_whiteday__arsenal,0,1.0,False
1kbnbp9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbnbp9,Can I put regular coffee grounds in a Philips 1200?,"So my question is. Can I use REGULAR non espresso coffee grounds in the bean tray of a Philips 1200? 

The reason I ask, is because I did it since I bought the machine new. Problem is, the coffee came out suuuper watery, reddish and definitely not black. 

I removed the regular coffee grounds, pre grinded them on my grinder and placed it in the chute, and the coffee came out black, AND the disposed coffee came out in a nice solid puck.

The espresso beans and the regular coffee produce a sandy broken up clump in the dump tray

So is the top part ONLY for espresso beans? Could it be regular coffee doesn’t dispense and grind enough to actually make black coffee? ",1,1746036828.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False
1kbnaxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1kbnaxe/lets_talk_strategy_how_we_can_collectively/,Let's Talk Strategy: How We Can Collectively Boycott Large Corporations and Support Small Businesses Instead,"Hey everyone,

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about where my money goes and the impact of large corporations on our communities, workers, and the economy. Many of us feel frustrated by corporate practices, monopolies, and the decline of local character.

I want to start a discussion (and hopefully inspire some action) on how we can actively shift our spending away from the giants – the big chain restaurants, grocery conglomerates, tech behemoths, etc. – and consciously support small, local businesses instead.

This isn't always easy, but even small changes, when done collectively, can make a difference. It's about voting with our wallets and investing in our own communities.

**Why Bother?**

* **Keep Money Local:** Small businesses recirculate a much larger percentage of their revenue back into the local economy compared to chains.
* **Community Character:** They contribute to the unique identity and vibrancy of our towns and cities.
* **Potentially Better Ethics/Treatment:** While not universal, small businesses *can* offer better working conditions and are often more accountable to their local community.
* **Unique Products & Services:** Find things you won't see everywhere else.
* **Personal Connection:** Often, you get better, more personalized customer service.

**How to Boycott the Big Guys (Sector by Sector):**

* **Restaurants:**
   * **Avoid:** Major fast-food chains (McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell), large casual dining chains (Applebee's, Olive Garden, Chili's), big coffee chains (Starbucks, Dunkin').
   * **Instead:** Explore local diners, family-owned restaurants, independent cafes, food trucks, ethnic eateries in your area. Pack lunches more often, brew coffee at home.
* **Grocery Stores:**
   * **Avoid:** Large supermarket chains (like Kroger, Walmart Supercenter, Albertsons, etc. - *adjust based on your region*).
   * **Instead:** Seek out local independent grocers, farmers' markets (seasonal but great!), CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture), butchers, bakers, fishmongers, ethnic markets. Even consider growing some of your own produce if possible.
* **Tech & Electronics:**
   * **Avoid:** Big box stores (Best Buy), dominant online retailers (Amazon).
   * **Instead:** This is tougher. Look for local computer repair shops (they sometimes sell refurbished gear), independent electronics stores (rare but they exist!), buy used/refurbished from reputable sources, prioritize repairing your current devices. Support creators directly where possible for software/digital goods.
* **Clothing & General Merchandise:**
   * **Avoid:** Fast fashion giants (Shein, H&M, Zara), large department stores, Amazon.
   * **Instead:** Thrift stores, consignment shops, local boutiques, craft fairs/markets, antique shops, buy directly from independent makers online (Etsy can be okay, but research the seller). Focus on buying less but better quality. Mend clothes.
* **Books & Media:**
   * **Avoid:** Amazon, large chain bookstores (Barnes & Noble).
   * **Instead:** Independent bookstores are treasures! Use your local library (the ultimate boycott!). Buy used books.

**How to Find and Support Small Businesses:**

* **Search Locally:** Use search terms like ""independent bookstore near me,"" ""local butcher,"" ""family-owned restaurant "" (or your specific town).
* **Walk/Drive Around:** Explore your own neighborhood and downtown areas.
* **Ask Around:** Word-of-mouth is powerful. Ask friends, neighbors, or colleagues for recommendations.
* **Local Social Media:** Check local Facebook groups or subreddits – people often share finds there.
* **Farmers' Markets:** Talk to vendors – they often know other local producers.
* **Beyond Buying:** Leave positive online reviews, tell friends about businesses you love, engage with their social media, be patient (they don't have huge staff), offer constructive feedback directly.

**Acknowledging the Challenges:**

* **Cost:** Sometimes small businesses *can* be more expensive due to lack of scale, but not always! Farmers' markets can be cheaper for produce in season. Quality often lasts longer.
* **Convenience:** Chains are often built around convenience. Supporting local might take a little more planning.
* **Availability:** Depending on where you live (especially rural areas), options might be limited.

**The Goal:** Progress, not perfection. Maybe you start by swapping your chain coffee for a local cafe once a week, or visiting the farmers' market instead of the supermarket for produce. Every little bit helps build momentum.

**Let's Discuss!**

* What are your favorite local businesses you love to support?
* What strategies do you use to avoid large corporations?
* What are the biggest challenges you face?
* Share your best tips and discoveries!

Options like freelance writing jobs, freelance writing editing jobs, and dog pet sitting services don’t require you to share your life online. You can earn good money and control your schedule without having to chase likes or followers. This post shares the best side hustles ideas where social feeds play no part, and explains how to get started — no hashtags needed.

# Freelance Writing and Editing Jobs

Freelance writing jobs and freelance writing editing jobs stand out as side hustles that let you skip social media and get right to work.

# How to Get Started With Freelance Writing

You don’t need a byline in a major publication to start freelance writing jobs — just a few writing samples and a plan. The key is to show what you can do and where you can do it.

Here’s how to break into freelance writing step-by-step:

1. **Build a Small Portfolio**

* Pick 2–3 short pieces in topics you’d like to write about. These can be blog posts, opinion pieces, or articles.
* Consider writing samples for “fake” clients or content about your hobbies. Quality matters more than size.

**2. Choose Where to Look for Gigs**

* Top platforms for freelance writing jobs include Upwork, Fiverr, and specialized job boards.
* Great places to explore are detailed in this list of the [best freelance websites for writers](https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=1111145&brand=fiverrmarketplace&landingPage=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.fiverr.com%252Fsearch%252Fgigs%253Fquery%253DWriting%2526source%253Dtoggle_filters%2526ref_ctx_id%253D254275300afe464586d284259cc5831b%2526search_in%253Deverywhere%2526search-autocomplete-original-term%253Dwriting%2526ref%253Dpro%25253Aany).
* You can also find jobs on industry sites or dedicated boards, such as these [freelance writing platforms](https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=1111145&brand=fiverrmarketplace&landingPage=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.fiverr.com%252Fsearch%252Fgigs%253Fquery%253DWriting%2526source%253Dtoggle_filters%2526ref_ctx_id%253D254275300afe464586d284259cc5831b%2526search_in%253Deverywhere%2526search-autocomplete-original-term%253Dwriting%2526ref%253Dpro%25253Aany).

**3. Pitch Yourself Clearly**

* Write a quick intro for listings or email pitches.
* Highlight your skills, samples, and what you enjoy writing about.

**4. Apply Consistently**

* Set aside time daily or weekly to apply to new gigs.
* Don’t stop after your first few rejections — consistency is where most beginners miss out.

**5. Focus on Clear Writing**

* Clients want clear, error-free content, not big words. Use plain language.
* Always proofread before sending.

# Pro Tips for Beginners:

* Create a simple online portfolio — try free sites like Contently or WordPress.
* Never work without a rate agreement.
* When you finish a project, ask happy clients for a testimonial to help build credibility.

The best part? These freelance writing jobs are flexible — work when you want and earn extra cash by the hour, article, or project.

# Opportunities in Freelance Editing

Freelance editing is a close cousin to writing, but the work is different. Instead of starting from scratch, editors help polish, fix, and improve someone else’s writing. If you have an eagle eye for detail and love fixing grammar, freelance writing editing jobs are a natural fit.

**What Sets Editing Apart from Writing?**

* Editors focus on improving what’s already written.
* Tasks range from correcting spelling and grammar to rewriting awkward sentences or tightening up flow.
* Many writers also edit, but editing requires patience and a knack for spotting small but important mistakes.

**Who’s a Good Fit for Editing?**

* If you find yourself spotting typos everywhere, editing might be for you.
* Editors need to be organized, deadline-driven, and great at communicating feedback.
* Detail-oriented thinkers and grammar lovers do well here.

**How to Start With Freelance Editing:**

* Review free online resources and tutorials for basic editing skills.
* Build a sample portfolio just like with writing — edit volunteer pieces, friends’ work, or pick up small proofreading jobs.
* Platforms such as freelancer job boards and editorial groups are key entry points. Check out guides like this on [how to become a freelance editor](https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=1111145&brand=fiverrmarketplace&landingPage=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.fiverr.com%252F%253Futm_source%253D1111145%2526utm_medium%253Dcx_affiliate%2526utm_campaign%253D_bus-y%2526afp%253D%2526cxd_token%253D1111145_40462870%2526show_join%253Dtrue).
* Some editors also start their business with a website and professional name, as explained by this article on [starting a freelance editing business](https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=1111145&brand=fiverrmarketplace&landingPage=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.fiverr.com%252F%253Futm_source%253D1111145%2526utm_medium%253Dcx_affiliate%2526utm_campaign%253D_bus-y%2526afp%253D%2526cxd_token%253D1111145_40462870%2526show_join%253Dtrue).

**Tips to Land Your First Editing Gigs:**

* Share before-and-after samples when you apply.
* Start with basic proofreading and work your way up as you gain references.
* Join online writing and editing groups for word-of-mouth gigs — these are strong sources for steady work.

Both freelance writing jobs and freelance writing editing jobs offer true flexibility and direct pay for your skill — no social media presence needed. These remain classic side hustles ideas if you want to work quietly while still earning a steady income.

# Dog Walking and Pet Sitting Services

Dog walking and pet sitting services let you earn steady money while helping pet owners who need a hand.

Many people trust a local, reliable person over a faceless app. Here’s how you can start offering these side hustles ideas and build trust in your community.

# Becoming a Dog Walker or Pet Sitter

Setting up as a dog walker or pet sitter is simpler than you think. Follow these steps to start your journey and offer dog pet sitting services with peace of mind.

1. **Research Local Laws**

Check if your city or county requires business licenses for pet care. Some areas need a permit to walk dogs professionally or run a pet sitting business.

**2. Get Insured**

* Protect yourself and the pets in your care. Look for pet sitter’s liability insurance — it’s affordable and adds credibility.
* Insurance covers everything from slips and falls to lost keys and property damage.

**3. Complete Basic Training**

* Even if you know pets well, complete a basic pet first aid course or online safety class. It shows clients you’re serious about their pets’ well-being.
* Some clients appreciate CPR training for dogs and cats.

**4. Set Your Rates and Services**

* Decide which services you’ll offer: walks, home visits, overnight stays, or all of the above.
* Compare your prices to others in your area, but don’t be afraid to charge fairly for quality service.

**5. Create a Simple Service Agreement**

* Document the details for every job — times, dates, emergency contacts, pet routines, and payment terms.
* This protects you and helps avoid confusion.

**6. Build Trust Early**

* Always meet new clients and their pets before the first job.
* Dress professionally, communicate clearly, and share any experience or certifications.

# Finding Clients Offline

* Provide excellent service and ask for referrals after each job.
* **Flyers and Local Boards**
* Create simple, friendly flyers with your service details and contact info.
* Pin flyers on notice boards at local cafes, pet stores, apartment complexes, and vet offices.

* Offer a first-walk or meet-and-greet discount to encourage trial.

Pet sitting and dog walking are not just side hustles ideas; they’re a way to turn a love for pets into repeat business for years to come.

# Other Social Media-Free Side Hustle Ideas

Not everyone wants to post online or build a digital brand to earn extra income. Luckily, plenty of side hustles ideas work perfectly well offline — and sometimes even better without a single hashtag. If you’d rather connect in person and put your skills to use where you live, this section highlights tutoring, delivery, and errand services as two strong options. These allow you to generate reliable income, just like freelance writing jobs or dog pet sitting services, but you won’t need any social media presence. Proven offline marketing tips work wonders for each path.

# Tutoring and Teaching In Person: How to Start and Find Clients Locally

You don’t need a classroom to make money from your smarts. Private tutoring delivers solid income for many people — teachers, college students, even professionals who love to help others level up. Here’s how you can launch your own local tutoring side hustle without any social media involvement:

1. **Pick Your Subjects and Age Groups**

* Stick to areas where you’re confident, such as math, science, reading, or music. Students of all ages need help; you can focus on school kids or even adults learning new skills.

**2. Decide Where You’ll Meet**

* Offer in-person sessions at local libraries, coffee shops, or even at clients’ homes (if comfortable). Libraries and community centers are safe bets.

**3. Set Your Rates and Schedule**

* Research rates charged by tutors in your area. Keep your fees reasonable to start, but don’t undervalue your time and expertise.

**4. Create Simple Marketing Materials**

* Design a short flyer or business card. Include your services, qualifications, rates, and contact info.

**5. Find Clients Without Social Media**

* Place flyers on community boards at libraries, grocery stores, schools, and coffee shops.
* Network with local teachers and ask if they know families looking for tutoring. Many schools post lists of recommended tutors.
* Partner with after-school programs, music studios, or community centers.
* Direct word of mouth works — let friends, neighbors, and even past clients spread the word.

**6. Be Professional and Reliable**

* Always arrive on time and prepared.
* Use clear progress tracking so parents or clients see results.
* Share feedback and suggestions after each session to build trust.

Check out this handy guide with even more strategies for getting private tutoring clients offline: [**Effective Ways to Get More Private Tutoring Clients**](https://amzn.to/4iD1Ulq)**.** Many top tutors find steady work without ever logging on to social platforms.

# Delivery and Errand Services: Earn Locally Without Going Online

Some side hustles ideas work best when you get out and meet real people. Delivery and errand running are two flexible options where your neighbors become your clients — no online fame required.

# What Can You Do?

* Shop for groceries, pick up prescriptions, drop off dry cleaning, or deliver takeout from local restaurants.
* Run errands for busy professionals, seniors, or anyone recovering from illness or surgery.

# How to Start

* Make a list of services you offer. Include things like laundry drop-off, hardware store runs, or special holiday help.
* Print up flyers or business cards with your details — post them at senior centers, medical clinics, libraries, and coffee shops.
* Introduce yourself at local small businesses — they often need last-minute runners or regular help with pick-ups and deliveries.

# Best Tools and Apps (No Social Needed)

* Use simple job platforms like [TaskRabbit](https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=1111145&brand=fiverrmarketplace&landingPage=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.fiverr.com%252Fsearch%252Fgigs%253Fquery%253Ddog%252520training%2526source%253Dtop-bar%2526acmpl%253D1%2526search_in%253Deverywhere%2526search-autocomplete-original-term%253Ddog%252520%2526search-autocomplete-available%253Dtrue%2526search-autocomplete-type%253Dsuggest%2526search-autocomplete-position%253D1%2526ref_ctx_id%253D2c3dc149f91640439a213e66241fd99b), which connect clients to local help without requiring a social media presence.
* Some cities also have local delivery-focused co-ops or directories — these are made for community connections and don’t require you to post online.

# Tips for Succeeding

* Prioritize punctuality and clear communication.
* Keep receipts and document each task, so clients know what got done.
* Offer bundled services for repeat customers (for example, weekly errands for seniors).

You can see how other services operate — and get inspiration for your own business — from companies like [Errand Boy Logistics](https://errandboylogistics.com/) or community-driven platforms like [Right On Time Errand Services](https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=1111145&brand=fiverrmarketplace&landingPage=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.fiverr.com%252Fsearch%252Fgigs%253Fquery%253DRight%252520On%252520Time%252520Errand%252520Services%2526source%253Dtop-bar%2526ref_ctx_id%253D61de0697fbf34354a26c6d472b75dbad%2526search_in%253Deverywhere%2526search-autocomplete-original-term%253Dright%252520on%252520time%252520errand%252520services).

My life was good. I’m not bragging or whatever you want to accuse me of doing. I’m just stating a fact. My life still looks good. I have a good job, a home, I’m healthy. So what’s the problem?

 My therapist is trying to frame me for murder.

 Last night I was doing my regular jog around the neighborhood when I got a call from Pete. When I answered the phone, Pete went into beast mode.

“Annie, you should have never messed with me,” he said. I could feel the anger in his voice like slaps on my face. “Why did you do it?  I will never forgive you. You better watch your back.”

Pete is my colleague from my marketing job. I’m not his office wife or whatever, just a colleague. We are the heads of two different teams. Is there competition? In his head maybe. OK, we work for the same company, and sure, we are all happy with each other’s successes but there’s also the bonus thing. Whoever manages a better marketing campaign for their respective client, they get all kinds of perks including a cash bonus.

I work on non-fiction book marketing campaigns and so does Pete. Is he competitive? That’s what everyone says. I don’t really pay much attention to that kind of stuff. They call me bulldozer Annie. So honest that people get angry, so indifferent to everyone’s ill intentions I don’t feel a thing. Like a bulldozer demolishing buildings without a second thought and not giving a damn.

I don’t care. But now here I am, standing at my apartment’s front door.

My running clothes from last night? They are rolled up in the laundry basket still covered in mud and blood. The clothes I’m wearing now are clean and I’m office-ready. Muscle memory must have taken over.  All I can remember is standing in that park near my house in the torrential rain staring at Pete’s dead body.

And that wasn’t even the weirdest part.

At work everyone acts normal. Pete isn’t here of course. But no one seems to care? I don’t know. He wasn’t that unlikable. Why isn’t anyone saying anything? I’m not going to ask about him. That would be incriminating if they ever do find his body, right?

I’m going to grab a coffee. Maybe I’ll overhear someone talking about Pete or maybe someone will come asking, eager to gossip or whatever it is they do in the break room.

I got another flash of what happened last night as I took a sip of coffee earlier. I don’t think I had anything to do with Pete’s murder but I absolutely buried him. Maybe buried isn’t the right word. Pete is definitely well-hidden.

No one has come asking about anything. Not even why Pete didn’t show up at work. I’m on my way to see my therapist. I’m sure that man has something to do with all this. No. Scratch that. I know my therapist is trying to frame me for Pete’s murder. I just don’t know why or how he did it.

The worst mistake of my life was start seeing this damn therapist. I don’t want to go but I have to maintain my normal routine, right? To not raise any suspicions?

 

**Update 2**

Jeremy, my therapist, he was acting even weirder than normal yesterday. If it had anything to do with Pete’s murder he didn’t let on. He is really good at that stuff. He likes messing with people’s heads. And now he has decided to mess with my life.

I will not go down like this.

Now I’m home, about to go for a jog. I need to keep my routine to not raise any suspicions. Maybe I’ll remember something too, taking the same route as yesterday. Let me lock the door.

I should think about this while running. Jeremy is definitely a psychopath. He always tells me to do things that I know are making my life worse. Let me explain. My life was fine. I did not need to see a therapist. But this one book I was creating a marketing campaign for, it was all about the necessity of therapists and that everyone needs one to become the awesome person they are destined to be.

Something like that. Whatever. I bought it. I went to see a therapist. Then after every session with Jeremy I started second-guessing every decision I had made at work that day. I never did that before. I am good at what I do. I’ve got the bonuses to prove it. Oh, and guess who recommended that therapist to me.

Yes, Pete. No wonder that man was so negative the past few months. Jeremy must have poisoned his mind. Or maybe…could they have been working together to ruin my life?

During our session yesterday, I started thinking Jeremy could be a serial killer. He started talking about murderers after I told him about the book marketing campaign I’m working on. The book is about sugar candy. Seriously. How do you go from candy to murder?

He would just not shut up about it. He analyzed three different cases of serial killers in grim detail. I think at some point, when he talked about this one guy who murdered his girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend, he drooled from joy.

Wait a minute. I just got another flash. The park looks so different when it’s not raining. The vegetation is so lush in that one area and the trees so tall with long intertwined branches. There are soft lights placed around strategically. Maybe they were going for a romantic effect but all I get is a creepy vibe.

It is the perfect spot for murder.

Everyone seems to avoid this park. I am alone. My feet crunch underneath the dirt. My body moves at its own will. Is that it? Yes. I had to dig around a bit but over here, in this dark corner of the park, hidden among the thick bushes, I see it. A manhole cover.

Down here. This is where I hid Pete.

I should leave before anyone sees me.

Come to think of it, you know what was even weirder that night? The weather. It only rained at the park. Even the road just outside the park area was dry. At least I don’t see any footprints on the pavement outside the park. It was raining so much when it happened, I must have left some solid, muddy footprints for anyone to find as I jogged back home.

But no. Nothing. As if I was never here. It’s weird, isn’t it? It’s not like Jeremy or Pete can control the weather. And it’s not like this has happened before. Not in the five years I’ve been living in this neighborhood. I don’t think so anyway.

They’ll never find Pete down there, right? I’ll just have to wait and see if anyone comes looking for him at work tomorrow.

Oh, and start stalking Jeremy. If my suspicions are correct, he will strike again. I need to be there to record anything I can to use as evidence if the police ever come knocking at my door.

 

**Update 3**

 

The days after Pete’s murder keep getting weirder. Apparently, Pete had asked for a personal day and that’s why no one asked about him the day after his murder. Yesterday was a different matter.

The police want to ask questions. A standard procedure thing everyone keeps saying. I worry. The detective in charge asked me to go by the station. They interviewed everyone else at the office. I have a bad feeling about this.

Earlier today I changed my therapist appointment to an earlier time. This way I could follow him after he saw the last patient. I followed Jeremy for two hours. On foot. He kept zig- zagging into side streets and strolling through parks. Did he see me? Was he doing this aimless walking on purpose? Toying with me? I lost him when he stepped into a coffee shop.

I waited for thirty minutes. He never came out. It was so late in the evening. I gave up.

I’m on my way home. I feel so tired. The creepy park where I hid Pete’s body is again empty. Even animals seem to avoid this place. There’s a weird mist hovering above the ground, circling the tree trunks, traveling silently through the night like a shark below the waves. It covers the whole park and yet the surrounding area is clear.

There is something wrong with this park; something sinister, something beyond this world.

Wait. Who’s this? Some strange woman is standing at my doorstep.

“Hello, can I help you?”

The woman looks confused. Or maybe she’s scared? I can’t tell.

“He is here.” Her voice sounds older than she looks. Her eyes are unfocused. Is she blind?

“Are you looking for someone?”

Nope. She is definitely not blind. She just grabbed my arms, staring right into my eyes as if she’s trying to suck out my soul. I’m not afraid, but that woman is strong. I can’t get her to let go.

“Please, you are hurting me. What do you want?”

“He is coming. He is coming for all of us. You have to save us.”

You know what I’m thinking? I’m thinking that woman is crazy. Her eyes lost focus again and she collapsed on the ground just now.

I look around. There’s no one. And I know that security camera by the door isn’t working. I really don’t know what’s the best thing I can do right now but calling the police isn’t even an option. How would that look?

I just step over her limp body and go inside.

I can’t sleep. No surprise there. Who was that woman and what was she on about? Did Jeremy put her up to it? Is he trying to scare me? It’s highly possible. At our session today he tried to imply that I don’t remember things I do. It’s not enough he is trying to frame me for murder he wants to drive me crazy too?

But you know what? Deep down I hope Jeremy paid that woman to scare me. Because if he didn’t? I don’t know. Ever since Pete’s murder I’ve been having this bad feeling. Maybe I should drop some hints about Jeremy tomorrow at the police station. They are going to find out that Pete and I share the same therapist anyway, right?

**Final Update**

I am exhausted.

It’s been days since Pete’s murder. Hiding in plain sight is burning holes through my guts. My heartbeat jumps up every time anyone approaches me. I’ve become a character in a world filled with jump scares.

Do they know? Am I going to wake up locked up in a confined space this morning? Intrusive thoughts are constant.

But I have not given up.

I’m following Jeremy again today. I came clean to the police the other day. About Pete recommending Jeremy to me as a therapist. They knew. I think I scored some honesty points by doing that.

They still suspect me though. I’m sure of it. Maybe Jeremy is planting thoughts in their heads; maybe there are more people at work who don’t like me, saying things. I’m not going to waste time on them.

As long as I manage to get evidence against Jeremy, I’ll be OK. At least in a courtroom, right?

Wait, is this the way to my place? What the hell is Jeremy up to? I don’t think he is messing with me again. I’m confident he doesn’t know I’m following him.

My heart skips a beat. I hate to admit it but it’s from joy. Joy that Jeremy is meeting a woman. At the sinister park near my house. This is what vindication feels like.

No scratch that. This is what hope feels like. How do I know? Because the sensation I get when I see Jeremy strangle that woman, that’s what vindication feels like. I cannot even feel bad about it. This is what working against sinister forces does to you.

It’s a scary realization. I, an all-around good person, I am standing here witnessing a murder and I am not feeling sad or guilty, but hopeful.

So, this is my warning to you.

Stay away from bad people. It is dangerous even if they don’t want to kill you. You just don’t know who you will become.

But let’s go back to the murder.

I recorded everything on my phone. I’m lucky. Jeremy dumped the woman’s body in the same hole at the darkest corner of the park where Pete’s body languishes. Coincidence or not, I don’t care.

I’m sure of one thing. I’ve got all the evidence I need.

And sure enough, that evidence was all the police needed. Guess what. Jeremy is a serial killer and the police couldn’t do anything about it because all they had was circumstantial evidence. My shoddy little video was exactly what they needed to search his place and now the police are drowning in evidence.

Here’s another tip for you. If you decide to commit a crime, don’t document it. Or reminisce in any way, or try to profit from it.

Not until you are in prison anyway. Then you can entertain your prison friends with your stories and write all the books you want.

Really disturbing things came out during the first day of the trial. I am now fully confident that not only am I off the suspect list for Pete’s murder, but Jeremy is taking the fall for it. No more questions asked.

Oh, and that crazy old woman I found on my doorstep that day? I never saw her again. The park is still weird, but it feels more like a sanctuary now. Is it because deep down I know that if pushed to the brink I can get away with murder? I don’t know. I feel like that park is an accessory to bad deeds.

An enabler.

1kbmuco,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kbmuco/can_express_water_ro5dx_reverse_osmosis/,Can Express Water RO5DX Reverse Osmosis Filtration System Truly Improve Your Water Quality? Review,"**Impressive Filtration System and Great Addition to My Kitchen**

The Express Water RO5DX Reverse Osmosis Water Filtration System was something I stumbled upon during my search for convenient under-sink water purification options. Tired of constantly refilling pitchers and dealing with mediocre faucet filters, I decided to give this system a go. Paired with a Blink Video Doorbell, it also seemed like a nifty combo unit to integrate into my household. After using it for about six months, I feel well-equipped to share how it truly performs in the day-to-day grind.

**Compact Design and Installation Experience**

One of the first things I noticed when unboxing this device was how compact and well-packed everything was. It’s designed to fit under most kitchen sinks without causing a cluttering nightmare, measuring about 14 x 15 x 5 inches. Installing this under my own sink took a little time—being completely honest, I’m not the handiest person—but the quick-connect tubing system helped a lot. I appreciated that all necessary filters and even a filter housing wrench were included in the package, making the initial setup feel less daunting. However, depending on your specific kitchen layout, you might need additional tubing or even a pump if you're connecting to a refrigerator.

**Benefits**

- Reduces 99.99% of contaminants, including chlorine, lead, fluoride, and cyanide.  
- Compact system fits snugly under the sink.  
- Features a leak detection system that automatically shuts off water flow on sensing moisture.  
- NSF-certified, ensuring safety and quality performance.

[Check Express Water RO5DX Reverse Osmosis System price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b09nvwq7gl/)  

**Performance and Water Quality**

As someone who pays close attention to water quality, especially because I use it for drinking, cooking, and brewing coffee, I was delighted by the noticeable difference in taste and clarity. The five-stage filtration delivers some seriously pure water. Most importantly, no lingering chlorine smell or strange aftertaste—what’s not to love? The maximum water flow rate of 0.8 GPM felt sufficient for my household, though I could see larger families wanting slightly higher output. The included storage tank holds around 3.2 gallons of filtered water, which has been more than enough for daily use, even with frequent refills for my coffee machine and water bottle.

**A Few Downsides to Consider**

While I’ve largely enjoyed the system, there are a few aspects where it could improve. The efficiency could be better, as the system discards one to three gallons of wastewater for each gallon of purified water produced. It’s a standard issue with reverse osmosis systems but one worth mentioning for eco-conscious buyers. Additionally, you’ll need decent incoming water pressure (40-80 PSI) for it to function optimally. In my case, I had to invest in a booster pump, which added to the overall cost.

**Critiques**

- Wastes a significant amount of water during the filtration process.  
- High reliance on adequate water pressure may require additional equipment.  

**Comparison With Similar Products**

Comparing it to pitcher filters like Brita or basic faucet-mounted systems, the Express Water RO5DX outright wins in filtration performance. Those just don’t eliminate impurities like fluoride or heavy metals. On the higher end of the spectrum, the APEC Water Systems ROES-50 is another solid choice, and it’s known for marginally better wastewater ratios. However, APEC filters aren’t as easy to replace. What sets the Express Water system apart is the added safety of its leak detection shutoff feature—something I didn’t find in the APEC system. That alone gives me more peace of mind, especially for an under-sink product.

**Affordable Quality**

Is this product worth its price? Absolutely, considering all the features crammed into one system. The leak detection feature, five-stage filtration, NSF certification, and ease of filter replacements make it a high-value investment. Not to mention, I’ve already saved a fair amount by no longer depending on bottled water.

1kbmsbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/framework/comments/1kbmsbm/wanna_switch_from_macbook_and_use_linux_but/,Wanna switch from MacBook and use Linux but having doubts,"For me 2 main competitors to Framework are a Thinkpad or another MacBook. Now, to the doubts

First, repairability. Let’s imagine I smashed the display or spilled coffee on my keyboard. I need my laptop to get fixed asap as I use it for studies & work. With a Thinkpad, I can go to a repair shop and they probably have needed details to make a replacement quickly. In case of framework, I need to order details and do it myself — which is not a problem, but the waiting time increases significantly.

Perhaps I have a wrong impression but looking at how laptops are shipped in batches and you need a long time to receive yours, I am having doubts about how fast I could receive my detail (I’m in Europe not US). Ok perhaps in Europe have a warehouse but what if I am traveling somewhere outside of Europe/North America? Maybe too theoretical but I feel like a Thinkpad would win in this case. 

Secondly, resale value (used market is important if our goals are about preventing waste etc). For me it’s gonna be an experiment, I believe in philosophy of Linux  but still not sure if it will work for me it in the end*. At some point I might cave in and want to return to macOS, in which case it won’t be hard to sell a new Thinkpad at a marketplace (with a big loss but still). While framework is relatively unknown here. 

Thirdly, how’s the build quality? I watched videos in the early days and it wasn’t the best, but perhaps the situation has improved. I am used to high build quality with MacBooks and would like to not downgrade significantly. With Thinkpads, particularly T14, T14s, X1C, the build quality seems to be pretty good. 

Fourth, I am price-sensitive. Apple that has reputation of being overpriced has actually made the new MacBook Air M4 really affordable, getting a MacBook with similar cpu/gpu power would actually be cheaper for me than a framework. Thinkpads though seem to be even more expensive here but perhaps that’s because I am looking at the more premium lineup. So basically mba m4 would be ~€1100 for me, a framework with similar horsepower (Ryzen ai 7 350) around €1600-1800 (depending on configs and if I’m willing to optimize price of ssd & ram), and a Thinkpad t14s 6 gen AMD would be €2100 which is crazy and probably too much for me (I could wait until Ryzen ai 300 comes to the more affordable Thinkpads though like the P series). 

Thanks in advance!

1kbmr15,https://www.reddit.com/r/BNHA_OC_Characters/comments/1kbmr15/kurara_grimm_alias_wretch/,"Kurara Grimm, Alias: Wretch","Alright guys, gals and other pals, this is the second oc I've posted here, and as the doesn't title read, the quirk is based off of the Cheshire cat (More specifically the ones by Burton and McGee). I honestly think quirk wise, I'll never get as good as my first oc I posted (Rika Sakera). But I should stop ranting about quality and start the oc as that's why you (yes you, the 3 people that clicked on it) are here isn't it?

**Name**: Kurara Grimm (Kurutta means crazy/mad in japanese + if you try hard enough Kurara sounds like Clara or *(sighs)* sounds like Chara (No offense to undertale and it's fans, I was also a part of the fandom a few years back, this is simply to add comedic effect for the 3 people reading this) and Grimm for the brothers Grimm while not having written Alice in Wonderland are just here as a tribute to dark fairy tales)

**Villain Name/Alias**: Wretch (What she was called by the staff at the facility (This'll make sense later)

**Age**: 16 (She's born November 26th which is the date *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* was first published)

**Occupation**: Maid Café employee by day, villain by night (The café only hires feline-type mutant quirk users and was severely understaffed. She hates it there — the fake cuteness, the forced smiles— but the pay is way too good to walk away.)

**Height**: 173cm (Around 5.8 feet)

**Weight**: 55kg (Around 121 lbs)

**Eyes**: Yellow, like disney's Cheshire

**Hair**: Black hair with a streak of faded lavender (She dyed it, didn't like it and is now waiting for it to fade)  
**Hairstyle**: A choppy, uneven, jagged, asymmetrical plushbob, one side going to her cheekbone and the other to her chin (She cuts her own hair, it doesn't look as bad as it sounds)

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Ok, before I give you what you're interested in, I'll give you her casual style and villain outfit. Why? Because villains are still human.

**Casual Clothing**: Her casual style includes, long-sleeves layered skirts, tights, and oversized sweaters — often second-hand and mismatched. But one thing all her outfits have (even when she works), is face mask (Like the ones we used to wear during covid) to hide her grin (She's self-conscious about the grin, once again, yes, she's human).

**Villain Costume**: Kurara's costume is a parody of her work outfit (Yes, the café she works at genuinely thinks she lost it, but it doesn't matter since they had spares) with some elements of a stage magician, the frills of her outfit are ragged and uneven. One sleeve drapes long and loose, the other torn away to reveal pale skin and sharpened claws. A jagged tailcoat-like bustle flares behind her, stitched together like a broken costume. With mismatched striped stockings that always change like she forgot which ones she wore the last time. And big chunky combat boots. If you need a base to visualise it think Corin's outfit from ZZZ + all the details I said just now. (Don't ask how she uses her quirk, let's just say she bought some light-bending material and put it everywhere so she can still go camo. Ok?) (God I hope I don't get flagged for sexualisation even though that is not at all my goal here)

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Alright, now it's time for the big reveal, but before that **I'll thank JaytheKitsune, for their help on fleshing out the concept into a veritable quirk**, that's all, go enjoy our interpretation on the Cheshire cat as a quirk.

**Quirk**: Cheshire (Wow original name aren't I right?)  
**Quirk Type**: Mutant

**Quirk Info**: The user's quirk gives them all the usual attributes of a feline-type mutant quirk — claws, whiskers, a tail, the cat ears, sharp reflexes, and enhanced agility and balance, though at a lesser degree than most full feline mutant quirks.

But in return, they gain two highly distinctive traits: a body with freakish flexibility, capable of twisting and contorting in unnatural ways that pure feline quirks can't reach, and skin/hair/you get it right? that can subtly bend light around it, allowing for a camouflage-like effect. While not true invisibility, this light-warping makes their body difficult to track, especially when still or in dim environments, often creating the illusion of them ""blending into the background."". The user also has a small amount of control over of it (the camouflage), just enough to be able to camouflage specific parts at their choosing(Eg: their entire body except their head (mimicking the classic floating head of the Cheshire cat)) (btw it's easier for the user to fully camouflage themselves than to isolate certain parts, as doing so requires focused control to maintain the visibility of only the chosen areas.)

And they also permanently bear the iconic features of that namesake: a massive, fixed grin stretching across nearly two-thirds of their face, filled with sharp, flawless white teeth, and large, slitted feline eyes that reflect light intensely. These features are always visible, even when the user is camouflaged — glowing softly in the dark, and grinning whether they mean to or not.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Alright personality time, I'll try to keep this short.

**Personality**: By day, Kurara's withdrawn, soft-spoken, and carefully controlled — following orders with deadpan politeness at the café, hiding behind a medical mask and avoiding attention. She hates the fake smiles and sugary act, but endures it with numb precision. And outside the café she acts mostly the same, except for the deadpan politeness, that turns into real politeness

By night, she becomes Wretch: sharp-tongued, eerie, and mockingly theatrical. She leans into the madness others once projected onto her — speaking in riddles, moving like a ghost, weaponizing the grin she’s loathes. It’s not chaos she craves, but control — on her terms. (This'll all make sense soon enough)

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Now is the time for the backstory, the time for trauma to be used as *flavoring* in the overarching idea that is an oc.

**Backstory**: Kurara Grimm was institutionalized at the age of two — not because she was dangerous, but because people believed she would be. Born to a German father (That's where we get the Grimm from) and Japanese mother, both suffering from severe psychosis, she was judged not for who she was, but for who they feared she’d become. Her quirk manifested at birth, an unusual occurrence, and it didn’t help her case: glowing feline eyes, a flexibility that seemed inhuman, and a wide, permanent grin that stretched nearly two-thirds across her face — sharp, perfect teeth on full display, even in sleep.

Though completely sane, she was committed to a child psychiatric facility, where she remained until the age of fifteen. The environment was surreal — less a hospital, more a containment facility for society's rejects. Her peers were unsettling, like distorted fairy tale characters come to life: a boy with a rabbit quirk who was obsessed with clocks, a quirkless child in a crooked top hat who held violent tea parties for imaginary guests, a girl who fancied herself a queen and ruled with a deck of razor-edged cards, and a pair of bald, spherically round twins who echoed each other in rhyme and movement like they shared a single mind. (Did you catch my great references? God I'm a great writer (Ironic))

Kurara was the only one who didn’t belong — not because she was the strangest, but because she was sane. Her quirk, which allowed her to camouflage and disappear into her surroundings, made her even more ghostlike. Staff avoided her called her a wretch (Oh my god, did you see that full circle?). Even some of the other children gave her wary space. She didn’t lash out. She simply watched, learned, and remembered.

At fifteen, she was quietly released into the world, her records stamped ""mentally stable"" and filed away. But the damage had been done. She hadn’t forgotten how quickly society would cage something it didn’t understand — how easy it was to be made into a monster without ever acting like one.

Now sixteen, Kurara's turned bad, with a certain hatred to systems like the one who basically imprisoned her. And acts mad to please what these systems thought of her.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Alright with the backstory out of the way, we get to the motivation.

**Motivation**: Kurara doesn’t want to be a hero. She doesn’t even care about being accepted. What she wants is control — over the story that was written for her without her consent. Branded a monster from the moment she was born, locked away for thirteen years like a ticking time bomb, then suddenly told she was “fine” and sent back into a world that never gave her a chance?

No.

They cast her in a role, decided she was dangerous before she ever spoke a word — and now they want to flip the script like nothing happened? If they’re going to call her a villain, then she’ll be one on her own terms. She’s not playing their story anymore. She’s writing her own — and it won’t have a happy ending for them.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

And before I leave you alone, lemme rapid fire some things she likes, dislikes, hobbies and habits since she is human.

**Likes**: Dogs (Ironic). Burn toast with butter. Literature (Specifically dark fairy tales.). Caramel coffees (The only upside to her job, she gets sneak out with some).   
**Dislikes**: Tea and it's supposed calming effects. Ethics classes (The concept of being taught that in schools seems a tad bit worthless to her seeing how she got sent to an asylum with no reason). Toast that isn't burnt. Jam. Her job.  
**Habits**: Mumbles sarcastic commentary under her breath (especially during café shifts). Sleeps in weird and contorted positions.  
**Hobbies**: People watching (Mostly people between ages 8-16, to see what she missed out on). Sewing (poorly) — she custom-patches her clothes with uneven stitching, often giving them weird “faces”(She's doing her best ok?).

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

so i took my first dose of methylphenidate 18mg last Sunday, there was a subtle positive effect on my verbal fluency and a bit of motivation, no euphoria or anything like that, i also always drink 2 shots of espresso after lunch so after the medication in 1.5-2 hrs.

The problem was i had a severe crash 10 hours after the medication, I've never experienced panic in my life before so i didn't know that this crash was something similar to panic attack, i was restless with shallow breaths, chatty, suddenly extremely hungry and fatigued and i wanted to sleep but my heart was racing and extremely tensed from the inside, everything subsidised in few hours.

The following days i had a similar crash but less intense, the problem is i was experiencing this crash earlier every day, the second day i had the crash 7 hours after the med, third day it was 6 hours later! Today is my forth day and i took the medication about 4 hours ago, im so concerned about the episode when it comes cuz i dont have anytime to waste now, i went to the polyclinic when i failed to manage the episode myself in my second day and they advised me to contact my doctor but i didn't because it was late.

The third day (yesterday) i was able to manage slightly with cold shower and breathing exercises but i went just to ask what can i do more and i was scared if the episode will come again, also the other dr there advised me to contact my dr, so i did today and my dr asked to stop drinking a coffee after taking the stimulant and take only one shot late in the day every other day.

The problem is i haven't had my coffee today and in only 4-4.5 hours post medication, im currently a bit restless and im scared today it will come even earlier. I just need something that i can do at home to not waste more time during the crash, other than cold showers and breathing exercises.",1,1746035389.0,Concerta,1,1.0,False

I’m planning a week-long trip to Oregon and looking for that perfect peaceful escape — ideally a small cabin or cottage tucked in the forest, with a river, lake, or ocean nearby.

I’m dreaming of a quiet, cozy place where I can unwind, maybe with some light fog in the mornings, trees all around, and the sound of water close by. Bonus if it’s remote and meditative, but still close enough to grab groceries or a cup of coffee without too much of a trek.

If you know of any specific towns, hidden gems, or even Airbnb listings that fit the vibe, I’d really appreciate the recommendations. Locals, hikers, cabin-lovers — please share your favorite spots!

1kbmpch,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1kbmpch/find_out_if_fresh_roast_sr800_coffee_roaster/,Find Out if Fresh Roast SR800 Coffee Roaster Delivers the Ultimate Home Roasting Experience,"Testing out the **Fresh Roast SR800 Automatic Coffee Bean Roaster** has been a game-changer in how I enjoy my daily cup of coffee. Having used it regularly for a few weeks, I feel like I’ve unlocked a whole new coffee experience. This isn’t just a machine; it’s a gateway to customizing and perfecting my coffee exactly the way I like it. But of course, as with any product, it’s got its highs and a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this coffee roaster was its compact and thoughtful design. Measuring 8"" x 8"" x 14"", it fits snugly on my kitchen countertop without dominating the space. The mix of high-temperature resistant plastic and stainless steel isn’t just a styling decision—it makes it durable and suitable for the intense heat this appliance deals with. The black exterior gives it a sleek, modern look, but it’s also easy to wipe clean after usage. One minor nitpick: I wish the power cord were just a tad longer. Depending on your kitchen layout, plugging it in could take some maneuvering.

**Ease of Use**  
As someone who hadn’t roasted coffee before, I genuinely appreciated how simple this device is to get started. The LCD digital status display is intuitive, making it easy to track the process at a glance. The adjustable heat and fan controls offer a lot of flexibility, though they might appear a bit overwhelming for absolute beginners. By the third roast, I felt more comfortable dialing in the perfect settings. If you’re an experienced roaster, you’ll find the granular control incredibly satisfying, but newbies like me might need a few attempts to nail down timing and temperatures.

[Grab Fresh Roast SR800 Coffee Roaster at the best price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b07z9q3tlq/)

**Performance and Results**  
I won’t lie, the first roast was a bit unimpressive—totally user error—but once I got the hang of it, this machine delivered incredible results. With nine power levels and a fluid motion speed roasting system, the beans roasted evenly, and I could achieve everything from a light, floral roast to a rich, dark espresso roast. In 5-10 minutes, I had coffee that smelled heavenly. One thing I noticed is that the stronger the roast, the more smoke it produces, so having proper ventilation is a must. The 1750-watt power is no joke; it heats up quickly and doesn’t lose consistency during operation.

**Capacity**  
This machine’s ability to handle up to 8 ounces of green coffee beans blew me away. It’s perfect for my daily or weekly needs, though some reviews I came across noted that it might be limiting for larger households. Roasting this amount equals around 14-28 cups of brewed coffee, depending on your brewing methods. If you’re itching to get experimental with blends and different roasts in small batches, this machine is ideal.

**Positives**  
Here are some standout highlights:  
• Fast roasting with consistent results easily within a 10-minute window.  
• Comprehensive manual controls for heat and fan adjustments allow you to customize the process.  
• Compact, lightweight design suitable for smaller kitchens.  
• Great for experimenting with blends and creating unique gifts for friends or family.  

**Bad Points**  
However, it’s worth noting a few caveats:  
• High smoke output during darker roasts requires solid kitchen ventilation.  
• The need for manual input might feel like a learning curve for beginners.  
• A slightly longer cord would have improved usability in tight spaces.  

**Competing Products**  
During my research, I looked at alternatives like the BEHMOR 2000AB Plus and the Gene Cafe CBR-101. Each of these has distinctive advantages, though they target slightly different audiences. The BEHMOR 2000AB Plus offers a higher capacity (16 oz.), which is double what this coffee roaster manages; however, it sacrifices compactness and ease of use for that extra volume. On the other hand, the Gene Cafe CBR-101 has an innovative off-axis roasting drum for ultra-consistent results, but it comes at a significantly steeper price point. Where this coffee roaster shines is in providing control and finesse at an approachable level for home roasters, while maintaining affordability and simplicity.

**Price Worthiness**  
One standout feature is how it balances its cost relative to competitors that offer similar controls and quality output. While I can’t share specific prices, this roaster manages to hit that sweet spot between premium features and a reasonable price point. It feels sturdy, performs well, and doesn’t fall short where it matters most—coffee roasting quality. For anyone dipping their toes into home roasting, this machine delivers excellent bang for the buck without going overboard.

1kbmngz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stepmom/comments/1kbmngz/i_feel_lost_and_this_is_my_rant/,"I feel lost, and this is my rant.","My stepdaughters and my husband are trashing my marriage. And I am ready to leave…

I F43 have a 12 yo son from a previous relationship. My husband (M40) was married before and had 2 daughters, 11 and 14.

My son was grown by myself, and he is a sweet and funny kid that is slowly starting to understand life and things are not going good for him. 

My husband had a toxic marriage, with a psychopath ex wife that and them divorced when the girls were 3 and 6 years old. Since then this women have grown their kids from hate and resentment towards their father. And when we got married, she lost her mind and dedicated her time to poisoning the girls against me and literally trying to destroy me. Hoping to kill me and hoping I kill myself. pretty hardcore. 

I am a highly sensitive person. And I feel guilty and disgusted because of it. Because it makes me weak. (I work with kids with behavior, physical and learning exceptionalities, and my sensibility is my super power) 

I carried an endogenous depression (childhood trauma) but I have been always taking care of it with therapy and pills. The fact I have a kid and husband gives me the strength to find help so I would not ruined their lives.

But doesn’t take the pain of constantly being treated bad by his ex, kids and now by him.
Since I met the girls 5 years ago that I was trying to be first their stepmom, then a friend, then myself, then just daddy’s wife, then a complete strange, diminishing myself to the point I would let their mom to insult me and wish me the worst when I secretly would email her to let her know that they came home with lice or that one of them needs some support on managing their 15 TikTok accounts where she is showing herself and dancing 
denigrating songs at 9 years old. Always sending secret emails to the ex to please sit and talk about our differences because I need to help the girls, I need to love them because I love my husband and he is always sad. 

(And he also resents my son big time. To the point that he quit any desk job taking with him and I literally became a married single mom. I cover my kid emotional and financial needs. My kid adores him, calls him dad.)

But I got back from his ex wife the most horrid emails you can imagine.

(The emails were secret because I didn’t want the girls or my husband to know because idk I have tried all by that point and all always failed and I am just a stupidly kind person that still had faith I would be able to be something for them.)

But the girls would talk so much crap about me to their mom, would inform everything we do and plan to their mom giving her the time to ruin it. And they also knew about the emails and even tho knowing my efforts they never give a f..k.

Well… husband last year recognized that he has issues understanding emotional pain in other people. If I am sad he gets upset. So imagine the S..t show. At least he recognized it and consider the idea that he might be in the spectrum. I accepted and understood. Because he is an amazing husband to me, really nice. He does nice stuff for me… but he just doesn’t get my heart and my feelings. 

But when it is about his girls… he puts me in the same level and forgets I am his wife. He became a monster. A miserable man. Because their girls are constantly trying to destroy our relationship. For example they don’t come to our home because I and my son are here. Lovely. And my husband cannot see the manipulation. He is blind.

In 5 years I have only manifested my sad and anger feelings to them one single time a few months ago. Because their mother rant against me in front of them. And felt extremely hurt and humiliated . That rant was enough for them to hate me to death. 

Girls have destroyed my mental health. I know it’s part of their mother fault. But they have a millionaire life style, travels the world, have everything that they want, no one said no to them, while we at home have forgotten what is drinking coffee in the mornings because we can’t not afford it anymore. (Husband pays child support, let’s say we, because all our moneys goes to a joint account, I am pretty stupid, eh?)

My husband is my son’s father figure. Because his biological father literally abandoned him when he was 4, time before he left he was very abusive and my little kid would try to defend me. So that’s when I start saving money to move from our place, but close to him so they can still be together. But his dad took this very bad and disappear. For ever. Causing a strong trauma on him. 

My son is a bless. I constantly get compliments about his behavior, empathy and good heart. While my husband just gets negative stuff from the girls schools… and people. And this has caused that my husband grows resentment against this kid and lose his crap against him 15 times a day. Leaving my child wondering why dad doesn’t love him.

My son refers to my husband as dad.
My husband has always remarked the fact that is his stepchild. And make huge differences in how he treat his natural kids vs the stepson. 

I am done seeing my son suffering 
I am done feeling this way because I cannot fight against 2 girls. I would never. 

So I just want to run away and start the happy life we lost with my son when I married this no-heart husband. 
But I cannot afford leaving this place…
I have no money, I cannot save. Nothing. 
I have no hope to leave until I save money!
It’s horrible
I feel trapped
I feel that I am exposing my child to an unhappy life
I feel that I am accepting my husband horrid behavior
I feel like I am ruin these 2 girls life
I feel useless as a wife, as a mom. I am
Not worthy… am not enough.
I am tired
Constantly thinking that I cannot make my husband happy and that make him happy is leaving him.
I feel so much anger when he accept that the girls are separating our family. 
I just want to run away and I can’t.
I just go to therapy. It doesn’t make much, so I ask my psychiatrist to raise my meds all the time. Because I want to fall asleep forever and I cannot leave my son alone (we are immigrants, so I have absolutely no family at all here. My support grid is so small that I rather say I don’t have any.) 

My husband is blind to my kid trauma. He doesn’t believe in his trauma. He barely understand mine. 
I know he had learning disabilities, and that he also is alcoholic. I wonder how much of his brain can handle “understanding”.

I am sorry the rant.
I am just defeated and skipped work because I can barely open my eyes for crying to the fact I need to stay here, and fake that everything is ok so things go in peace…

Thought it was gonna be a passing episode, but it continued until the start of my closing shift (it's still going on now). Before I clocked in, I went to the urgent care by my store to get it checked and my first bpm reading was over 200, but it quickly went down to ~100. They hooked me up to an EKG and everything. They told me to see a cardiologist, and sent me off with a doctor's note. I turned that in to my SSV, apologizing that I wouldn't be closing with them that day. Everyone on shift was understanding and told me to take it easy. 

Before I left, however, I checked my protected sick hours, and I didn't have enough to cover the full shift, let alone others if I need to take multiple days to sort this out. The SSV asked our manager if I would be reprimanded for it even with a doctor's note and, right before I drove off, they responded with ""We don't accept doctor's notes"".

1kbmkx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kbmkx9/should_the_tastyle_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Should the Tastyle Single Serve Coffee Maker Review Influence Your Next Purchase?,"Testing out the Tastyle 2.0 Single Serve Hot & Iced Coffee Maker has been quite the journey for me as a coffee lover. This compact, versatile machine has quickly become a staple in my daily routine, but like any product, it comes with its own set of highlights and challenges. Whether you're a homebody craving a morning brew or an office-goer seeking a quick caffeine fix, this brewer seems tailored for all sorts of coffee enthusiasts. Here’s my take on the Tastyle 2.0, along with its upsides and some heads-ups.

**Sleek Design That Fits Anywhere**

Its compact size really stood out to me; I’ve used similar coffee makers before, but at 10.3""D x 4.7""W x 12.2""H, this one wins major points for being space-efficient. It doesn’t crowd my kitchen counter, which is always a bonus when you’ve got limited space to play with. The modern black design is understated yet stylish, blending effortlessly into most settings—from dorm rooms to office break rooms or even small RVs. The fact that you can brew directly into a travel mug (up to 7.3 inches tall, once the drip tray is removed) further adds to its functional charm. Spill-free mornings, anyone?

**Outstanding Brewing Options**

I appreciate when a coffee maker offers flexibility, and this one doesn’t disappoint. You get three brewing styles: Classic, Bold, and Over Ice. While trying out these settings, I noticed how the Bold option produces a stronger brew without feeling overly bitter—perfect for those groggy mornings. Experimenting with the Over Ice feature was fun, and while not as strong as a cold brew, it delivered a refreshing iced coffee that didn’t taste watered-down. Whether you prefer K-Cups or ground coffee, this device accommodates both. It even includes a permanent ground filter, reducing the need for disposable waste—something my environmentally-conscious coworkers commented positively on.

[**Ready to buy Tastyle 2.0? Click for Amazon pricing.**](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dhrpwlmx/)

**Convenience in Daily Use**

The 40 oz detachable reservoir adds significant convenience. For someone like me, who drinks multiple cups throughout the day, it allows for 4-5 brews without frequent refills. This is a small yet impactful perk, especially when you’re pressed for time. Additionally, the machine offers six brewing sizes (6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 oz), ensuring that everyone in the household gets their preferred portion. Cleaning this coffee maker turned out to be a breeze as well—the built-in cleaning function effectively tackles calcium build-up, and the removable parts are dishwasher safe. To be frank, such maintenance ease is vital for a machine you’ll use daily.

**Energy-Saving Features**

Not many people talk about energy consumption in coffee machines, but I was impressed by the 10-minute auto shut-off feature. Whether I’m rushing out or just forgetful during busy workdays, this energy-saving addition provides safety and cost-efficiency. Although small, such considerations show how the manufacturer thought of daily user habits.

**Positives**

Here’s a quick look at why this machine stands out:  
– Flexible brewing styles for pods and grounds.  
– Compact size for small spaces (kitchens, offices, dorms).  
– Easy-to-clean removable components enhance usability.  
– Travel mug-friendly design prevents spills.  
– BPA-free materials and safety alerts like dry boil protection.

**Areas for Improvement**

Still, as much as I’ve enjoyed using it, there are a few quirks that caught my attention:  
– The Over Ice setting could produce stronger coffee; cold brew enthusiasts might find it lacking.  
– The bold brew mode is good but could benefit from finer control over extraction strength.  
– Water-shortage alerts function well, but it can be an audible annoyance for some people.

**Product Competitors**

Looking at other single-serve brewers on the market, a few comparisons come to mind. Machines like the Keurig K-Elite and Nespresso Vertuo also cater to coffee lovers with compact designs and multiple brewing modes. The Tastyle machine, however, holds its own with its extended brewing size range and more affordable quality. For instance, the Keurig has a more premium polish, but it often comes at a heftier price and lacks the built-in cleaning mechanisms included here. While Nespresso excels in espresso-making, it doesn’t accommodate ground coffee lovers, which is a win for the Tastyle 2.0. If versatility and budget-friendly pricing make your list of priorities, this coffee maker deserves more than just a glance.

**Value Proposition**

When comparing this brewer to others in its class, you really do feel like you’re getting good quality for its price tag. Considering features like reusable filters, energy-saving settings, and compact design, it punches above its weight for a single-serve product. Sure, some premium competitors might brew slightly richer coffee, but they also come with steeper price points. Besides, the versatility you get here (three brewing styles, multiple sizes) makes it hard to argue against its “value for money.”

I think this one's on me.","Hey all, I hadn't posted in some time because I was actually making a lot of progress. My wife and I started have sex weekly mixed with the occasionally hand job or BJ. The problem is I still felt it was like a task item for her. Like in order to keep the engine running, I have to fuck the husband once a week. She started freaking if we didn't and saying stuff like ""I know. Just one more night. Sorry."" Frankly, it's a real turnoff.

I've always been romantic, so I try to set things up. Like last weekend, she was away with the kids. I cleaned the entire house, cooked her favorite dinner, ran a scented bath, and planned on giving her a full body hemp oil massage after watching a historical drama she's been wanting to watch. At least that way, I could feel like when we had sex that I'd made an effort and that it was authentic. But, nope. It was around 8pm while she was playing video games with my daughters after their bath (she didn't end up taking it), that she wasn't going to take a shower, which is code for not tonight. I tried not to look frustrated. I really did, but I know she could sense it.

The next day. I was a little down but not grumpy. I had a lot of work around the house to do. Oh, and did I mentioned I was laid off in February? So there's always job hunting and networking to do. I cooked a nice dinner. Nothing special. We watched a little TV. She fell asleep per usual. 11:30 rolls around, she suddenly wakes up. ""What time is it!? We have to have sex."" I'm like I was in the mood yesterday and I don't really fancy fucking someone who was just drooling and sleeping right next to me for like an hour. BUT, and I think everyone here would likely do the same, I had to take what I can get.

So, you might think that's the interesting part of the story. But no, it gets more interesting. Flash forward to the next weekend. We went out together to run errands and have lunch and coffee. I kept it casual. Not overtrying this time. She was exhausted when we got home. I didn't even attempt it. I just watched a movie. The next day she had a lunch date with a friend. I stayed home and watched all the kids. What happened on that lunch date set off a chain of events.

Her friend told her that her husband was a sex addict and had cheated with her with over 20 different women over 9 years! It started when she was pregnant and no sex. He didn't really ask for sex after that and she didn't press it until recently when messages were discovered. You know how it goes from there. But to beat all, they're staying together and in therapy. Part of the guidance is they have to have sex regularly. MFer didn't even just dabble with adultery, still saves his marriage, AND gets to have sex with his wife under medical advice. Sure, I bet things are tense, but STILL.

And, you know what, after hearing all this my wife decides that even though she had wanted to have sex with me before lunch that the whole story killed her libido (I doubt it existed). Maybe tomorrow. Once again, I'm accountable for the actions of another man just as I was when I was laid-off. It doesn't help that I have a history of being cheated on. It feels like horrible men are always rewarded.

We tried to have sex the next night. I just wasn't into. I couldn't get it up. I felt like such a loser all day before that. No jobs. No interviews. No sex. And that's despite putting in 8-10 hours of effort on just the job front and the rest of my life on the wife and kids.

She was worried I was cheating. I told her that, ""no, I just feel like a loser who lost his job and can't find another and whose wife says she doesn't want to fuck him because some guy slept with 20 other women and maybe I'm a little jealous because I can't even get one woman to want to fuck me."" We talked a lot after that. No fighting. 

It's clear to me that she has no way to empathize with me. She sees us as ""us"" and what happens to me happens to us. I assured her that although it's impacting us that these things are happening to me. They are targeted at me. I am responsible. And that makes me feel all alone and need of some sympathy and kindness. Kindness she only seems to provide on a schedule or when I'm in a bad mood.

That's where we're at. It's a log jam. Not fighting. Just at an impasse as to how to handle this new information.",4,1746034858.0,DeadBedrooms,0,0.83,False

All those late nights, coffee-fueled study sessions, and sacrifices... and it's still not enough. I thought I was putting in the work, but I guess I wasn't enough.

I'm replaying the exam over and over in my head, wondering where I went wrong. Was it the questions or me? I've always done okay in school, but this score makes me question everything. Seeing my friends' scores, feeling like I'm at the bottom... it's tough.

The shame is overwhelming. I'm embarrassed to face my parents, teachers, and even myself. I feel like I've disappointed everyone. I'm trying to tell myself it's just a number, but the feeling of failure is hard to shake.

What ifs are haunting me – what if I studied smarter, focused on my weak spots, or just believed in myself more? It's hard to move forward when these doubts are eating away at me. Right now, it feels like I'm stuck, and I don't know how to get out.

1kbmg4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christian/comments/1kbmg4e/helpadvice_regarding_someone_at_church/,Help/Advice Regarding Someone at Church,"Dear friends,

On Easter Sunday I was baptized at my church. There was a woman from my small groups who had latched onto me the day I joined small groups about a month prior, telling me we should take the metro together to small groups since we live in adjacent buildings. I told her I prefer to Uber there as I have incorporated the costs into my budget and see it as useful with all things church. 

On Good Friday, she asked to go together to service. Afterwards, we stayed outside of our buildings speaking and then she plopped on me that I should see her Christian therapist. I said I don't think I would like to, and she pressed and pressed on me, and I said, ""I will pray to Jesus about it, thank you."" 

After my baptism, she messaged me after the later service she went to, asking me how it went. I said ""it was wonderful! I'm so glad I did it!"" Then she asks if I wanted to meet for coffee. I agreed and was excited thinking I had finally made a friend. When we sit for coffee, she brings up her ex, showing me a picture of herself at a hospital after abuse she encountered with him. We spoke about it, and then of other things, but I felt as if she were pressing to find out more about me in order to relate to me her struggles. 

Outside of my building as we left, something it seemed came over her and she began to tell me I wasn't ready for love, and I said, ""When am I ever ready? It is Christ who enables me to do all things."" And then she brought up her therapist again, telling me I have ""triggers"" and I said, ""I'm not triggered. I have joy. Jesus has healed me."" She kept pressing and pressing and I got upset but spoke calmly and said, ""You know, I would not treat someone this way on the day of their baptism."" And she ignored it and said, ""Oh, you are afraid. You're scared."" And I said, by the grace of God, ""God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and of a sound mind!""

Then she went into some type of zone, where she said, ""Oh I am sensing. I'm sensing about you. . . . I sense. I sense . . ."" And I cut her off and said, ""By which spirit are you sensing?"" And she didn't answer. 

She continued and then I said, I'll go home now. And as I said that she said, ""Oh, girl. Those demons are getting to you.""

  
I came home and went to Jesus. I felt sick. Upset. Violated. She then texts me and writes, ""Hey girl, on my walk home Ephesians 4 came to mind. Let the Word guide us then. You are loved by God."" And I responded back (even though I was not sure which verse of Ephesians she was even referring to) ""Hello, we are loved by Him. I keep no prisoners in my heart thanks to Jesus Christ. See you at small groups on Wednesday.""

The Lord brought up for me some discipline, along the lines of 'Do you want Me or worldly friends?' And I understood. I did not seek God and saw what she was capable of. She even, on Friday, tried to make me feel horrible that there would be no one to take my video of my baptism, but I said, 'Do not worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will take care of itself."" God will provide. (And He did! It was captured by dear sisters at church - but not her, she would not wake up in time for 9am service). 



Anyway, Wednesday comes, and she texts and says, ""I'm going to get to small groups another way but on the way back we can take the metro together."" And I firmly and kindly responded, ""Hey, I am going to take an Uber there and back from now on as I had originally planned. It is easier for me."" And she said, ""No problem."" 

  
At small groups, when people would share, I would catch her staring at me. Multiple times. She was watching me. And it shook me.

  
Now, my question is: Do I tell the pastor and/or his wife about this? I am new to Christianity and Jesus Christ is my life. And I have prayed about it, and told Jesus that today if You would want me to share what happened to the pastor or his wife, please guide me. 

I would just genuinely like to know your thoughts and what steps you would consider biblically, scripturally for me to take.

I appreciate you reading this - I wrote a lot and I thank you for your response if you do so.

It all started with an OF girl i was chatting with, Goddess K. Goddess K is a soft mommy domme that was experimenting with findom.

This was my first experience with findom. I started sending her money for coffee every few days. She was so appreciative, calling me a good boy, sending me pics of her day to brighten me up. She made me feel warm and submissive inside.

One day Goddess K wants to buy a new lingerie for an OF post. I impulsively bought her that lingerie with my drug money, so no drugs for me that week. She posted a video of her with the new lingerie, and she sent me an extra 10 sec vid of her praising me.

After that i started alternating between buying drugs and sending that drug money as tribute for Goddess. I still didn’t feel enough…

Then i applied to new higher paying jobs to fund my new addiction. Every time i get tired of sending resumes i play the video she sent me and got back to the grind. I got a new job a few weeks after and i sent her a large tribute without explaining. It made me so happy ❤️

My thoughts of doing drugs turned into thoughts of worshipping Goddess K. This went on for a couple of years until Goddess K stopped doing OF and got a boyfriend. She thanked me for my loyalty and we both had a talk, she can’t accept any more tributes because her boyfriend provides enough for her.

Nowadays i’m drug free with a good job. And every time i think about relapsing to drugs i save it in my account. Just in case Goddess K decides to accept tributes again 🐷

I really don’t think this could have gone better. I arrived at check in time (7:30am) which was a breeze. Waited for about five minutes after the paperwork and was called back. Answered a lot of health questions and then I changed into my gown, peed in a cup for the pregnancy test (I took my own tests at home over the last few days to make damn sure I didn’t have any terrible last minute surprise at the hospital) and sat down with my husband in a pre op chair. 

I also was kind of spotting and starting my period this morning (great timing lol) so they gave me some hospital underwear and a pad just incase while I was waiting. 

They got my IV started, gave me some liquid strong Ibuprofen and I answered more questions over the next 30 ish minutes. Very straight forward medical history stuff. Everyone was an absolute Angel. 

9 am I went back to the OR and got situated on the table. I had an all female care team which was cool! A nurse held my hand while I breathed oxygen. They gave me the meds and I was out in no time at all. 

It felt like a blink and I was waking up to the sound of my name. I woke up and was alert right away. I handle anesthesia pretty well so I wasn’t too groggy or dealing with shivers which can be totally common. I had zero pain when I woke up. I felt super happy and relieved. I was able to get back over to my recovery chair immediately, I got a new set of hospital undies and a pad. There was some orangey red stuff on the bed I was on so I expected a lot of bleeding from the uterine manipulator / my oncoming period but it actually hasn’t been that much at all. 

I got a sprite and a chocolate pudding, felt slightly light headed but still good. Was able to get dressed without any help from my husband and was ready to get out of there! My surgery lasted 1 hour from the very start of me lying down to me waking up. We were out of the hospital in 20 minutes after that. 

By 10:30 am I was back home. I had no issues drinking the iced coffee my husband got me, got out of the car on my own just fine and sat down on the couch. I’ve gotten up to pee twice (I feel like I need to pee a lot probably from the IV, sprite, large coffee and water haha). First pee didn’t hurt. A little sensitive and weird but I’m totally fine. I feel very little soreness and a very light crampy feeling. It’s 12:30 currently. I put an ice pack on my abdomen even though I didn’t feel like I needed it. 

My lower stomach is a little tight and bloated feeling but really only if I press on it.

I’m allowed to take more ibuprofen at 2… my doctor prescribed a little stronger medicine just in case. No idea what it is exactly yet as we haven’t picked it up. 

I haven’t felt the dreaded gas pains yet. Hoping if that comes on later it’s not a huge deal. I definitely feel comfortable walking around my house and so far so good!

So sometime between late Monday and early Tuesday morning my car was stolen. I did multiple loads of laundry at the laundromat and then I went back to my house after carrying so much laundry in my house I mistakenly left my keys in my car sitting in the passenger seat. The laundromat was the last time I drove my car so I didn’t realize it was missing until the morning when I tried to look for my keys to get coffee. Then I remembered forgetting my keys in my car so I went downstairs to look and that’s when I saw my car was gone. I immediately made a police report. The police came to my house. I explained everything that happened. I also called my insurance right after  explaining everything that happened as well. Later that day, my insurance told me that the car was recovered and towed but they don’t know where it was found yet they only told me the location of the tow lot. I was told by my insurance to go to the tow lot and if there are any damages, take pictures and send them which I did. There was lots of damage. My car was totaled!  I was also told to remove everything out of my car and to let the tow lot know that progressive would be picking it up. The next morning, the police called me, letting me know that the car was recovered (which I already found out from my insurance) they told me they are processing my vehicle for evidence and they asked if I can come down to the police station and give a DNA sample and fingerprinting. It just really confuses me because that’s my car. Of course my fingerprints & DNA would be in it. I’m not sure how this is beneficial for me at all in anyway. And I’m hearing a lot of things about how my DNA could forever be into the system and it could possibly backfire on me one day. Am I required? Or can I say no? I don’t know if I’m comfortable with this and I don’t know how to go about this. Please help!

I'm looking for an existing group, or to start up a new group, playing [Traveller](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/collections/traveller-rpgs). Primarily looking to join as a player, but open to alternating who plays the game master. Ideally looking to play Traveller specifically, as I all ready have a few books, but I'd be open to another system.

I'm new to Traveller, and I haven't played DnD in a quite awhile, but I've spent many a long weekend playing 3rd and 3.5e DnD, Pathfinder, BESM, GURPS, etc in my past so I'm not a complete noobie to the genre. That said, I'm also open to inexperienced people if we get our own group going; I enjoy teaching (even if I'm bad at it sometimes) and sharing the things I enjoy with folks.

Looking to meet anywhere from a couple times a month to once a week; I prefer longer gaming sessions if the group meets up less often. I can host as needed, either at my place in North Minneapolis or at my office in Downtown (North Loop near the river).

I've got a degree of social anxiety in large (8+) groups and events, so I'd prefer to find a local group over finding a pickup game at Source or the other game shops.

It’s not just the incredible food—it’s the whole experience that makes every visit unforgettable and we genuinely feel like coming home once we drive up to this charming place. 

From the moment we arrived, we felt genuinely welcomed (almost like coming back to a big family) 

The service was outstanding, absolutely professional, and just warm and sincere. A huge shout-out to Marco Franzelin, and the entire Sonnora family. World-class, as always.

The evening started with a selection of small bites (the ""Ouvertüre"") to set the mood—refined, playful, and beautifully presented. The second tarte with foie gras and truffle was our favorite. The official first course, goose liver with Périgord truffle, came with a clever quince vinaigrette and a touch of nori. Rich, elegant, and perfectly balanced.

My personal highlights of the night were the small tart of beef filet tartare on crispy potato rösti (absolutely perfect in flavor and texture), the grilled breton lobster with romaine and curry-laced vinaigrette which was just stunning, and the incredibly frog legs with poulard jus.

Other courses, like the langoustines, the Vendée turbot with spring morels and asparagus were also excellent. We left out the duck and I also skipped the cheese selection (my wife didn’t) because I was so full at that point.

And let’s not forget the wine pairings. Absolutely spot on. Every glass complemented the course without overpowering it. It felt effortless and thoughtful. We added the 2018 Cecile Tremblay Vosne Romanée 1er Cru „Les Beaumonts“ as a „by the glass option“ (Coravin) and Marco was so generous and also gave us a glass of 2018 Chapelle Chambertin Grand Cru to taste side by side - which although still very young was the best red Burgundy I had so far. 

Desserts brought a light and refreshing finish: rhubarb with garden herbs and elderflower vinaigrette, followed by Garriguette strawberries with aged Eiswein, vanilla crème ice cream, and airy yuzu. Just the right ending to a rich and fulfilling evening. But that’s not all, you get lots of small sweet bites (outstanding) with your coffee. 

Sonnora continues to be a place where Clemens and Magdalena Rambichler combine world class culinary craftsmanship with genuine hospitality. If you ever get the chance to go: do it. We already made our reservation for our next years anniversary.

Ever feel like you’re drowning in choices? Like, choosing what to have for breakfast suddenly feels monumental? 🤯 Trust me, you’re not alone! Decision fatigue is real, and let me tell you, it's like trying to navigate a maze with a blindfold on. 

A while back, I hit this wall. I was making decisions about everything—what to wear, what to eat, even which Netflix series to binge next! Spoiler alert: my brain was fried. 🔥

Then I stumbled upon a little gem of wisdom: **The 10-Second Rule.** And let me tell you, it’s a total game-changer. Here’s how it works:

1. **Time Limit**: Give yourself a hard stop of 10 seconds to make a choice. Yep, just ten seconds! ⏳
2. **Trust Your Gut**: In those ten seconds, go with your first instinct. Your brain’s gut-feelings are surprisingly powerful! Trust them.
3. **Move On**: Once you make the choice, let it go, and move on to the next thing. No ruminating allowed! (Seriously, stop debating whether you should have gone with the oatmeal or the eggs. It’s not worth it.) 

Why does this work? Well, think about it—**the more decisions we make, the more mental energy we drain.** By setting a timer, you're relying on that sweet, sweet intuition instead of overthinking every little detail. 

**Here’s a quick breakdown of the benefits:**
- **Less Stress**: You’ll be amazed at how freeing it feels to cut out the second-guessing.
- **More Energy**: With less time spent on decisions, you get to conserve that mental energy for the big stuff. Like, I don't know, figuring out your life goals! 😜
- **Faster Decisions**: Need to decide on an outfit or lunch? Boom! You're done. Think about all those extra minutes you just freed up!

And guess what? It even makes those everyday choices way more fun. It’s like playing a game against yourself. “Let’s see if I can pick a coffee flavor in 10 seconds... *Drum roll, please!*” ☕️

So yeah, if you're finding yourself stuck in the decision-making quagmire, give this 10-Second Rule a shot. You might just find that life feels a bit lighter and way more enjoyable.

“This is embarrassing, roll up your window. Do you even know how old this song is?” Mary groaned from the passenger seat at the sound of *Kickstart my Heart* blasting through the crappy speakers. She couldn’t see the stares and pointing, but she felt them through her drone's camera. At least the juiced up Cookie Monster street sweeper seemed to enjoy it from his dancing.

“I literally can’t roll up the windows,” Alex replied as he slapped the driver side door. “This puppy purrs though. It’ll get us there. I think.""

They clattered down the crowded shopping street in his rustbucket. Beepy and Zippy were seatbelted on either side of the bulging loot bag, beeping at each other in what sounded to Alex like an argument. Something glowing was leaking from the bag.

“Will you two shut up? I swear I’ll get Alex to turn us around and you,” Mary pointed at Zippy. “Can go back to sweeping the streets for coins. You, Beepy, oh you’ll be in trouble.” The bots mumbled and went back to sitting prim and proper.

A broomstick riding courier threw a coffee onto the window and shouted, “Turn that crap down!”. Alex couldn’t be bothered. Not when he was beaming inside and headed to Jemin’s. He had grown overnight.

That was the funny thing about the System. Upgrades to Skills needed sleep to settle in. No dramatic last-minute clutch saves to one’s ass. No perfectly timed Core awakening to destroy an evil universe God. Skills leveled after a good rest. Just like bodybuilding. Or a tooth whitening strip. The 3% increase from the sandwich he’d slotted in before he passed out and drooled probably helped. Titles though? Titles could pop and change everything in an instant. They could also be slotted in to get people to notice you. And Alex? He’d earned both. He grinned as they swerved around a half-wold teenager in a too-tight leather jacket that tried to cut him off by looking menacing. Alex just gave him a finger gun and a wink.

**\[TItle: Blazing Hot\]**

**\[You are a natural born Delivery Boy, with a sprinkling of charm to boot.\]**

**\[+3% Movement Speed when holding Hot Food. The little flames are just for show. Yes, they can be turned off, but why would you?\]**

He’d already slotted it into his Display Title. Now anytime someone \[Investigated\] him, they’d see **\[Alex - Blazing Hot\]**. There was also more.

**\[Running\] -** Level 5 -> Level 6

**\[Phantom Step\]** Level 2 -> Level 3

*What the heck does Phantom Step Level 3 get me? Going to try that one out for sure.*

Mary devolved into another scolding match with her bots as Alex weaved around the pedestrians and Monster workers and let his grin slip into something quieter. Yesterday had been harder than he admitted. He’d been scared shitless. From Britanii and the Dungeon and from the possibility of him screwing up his golden goose. But he hadn’t. He’d run and delivered. And he’d crushed it. Piping hot and every single pizza on time. He’d been so stunned that he hadn’t even really examined the loot. Not that he was a pro and nor was Mary. A simple \[Investigate\] didn’t get you very far to identify the true goodies. That’s what Jemin was for. All he knew was the water bottle potion that smelled like ammonia apparently would clean out his Core and that he had a very special delivery to make for the bone bracelet.

The System had just confirmed that he was on the right track. And for the first time in a long time, since he was fighting for his life on the streets, he was getting stronger. How far could he push the new version of himself? He also felt a bit cocky from overcoming his other greatest fear. Just then, his phone buzzed back with the newest reply. He couldn’t help himself and glanced down to read the message from the cracked screen. With a mountainous amount of courage, he had texted Snu that morning with a slick “U up yet? It's your favorite Delivery boy.”. They'd been texting all morning.

Mistress Snu: YOU SHOWED HER MY UNDERWEAR? If you don't like them, give them back.

Alex snorted and immediately let go of the wheel to type back. Halfway through his undoubtedly slick message, a loud BEE-DOOP! And a VRRT-WEEP! shrieked from the back of the seat.

“Alex!” Mary shouted as he looked up just in time to see a wall of floating pink puffballs he was about to ram through. Each frilled Yorkie Familiar wore aviation goggles and buzzed around a terrifying looking woman with a menacing looking sword strapped to her back. Her eyes locked onto his car like she was debating vaporizing them on the spot. Alex panicked and his \[Investigate\] activated automatically.

**\[Freeya - Great Conqueror of Conquering\]**

“Oh, shit!” Alex slammed on the breaks. The car jolted forward with a clunk that sounded extremely unhealthy for metal. Thankfully they skidded to the side of the road and the woman and perfect pooches were unharmed. The front bumper did clang and fall onto the road. The scary lady sniffed and strolled away and Alex checked on his passengers. Mary was swearing at him and Beepy had fainted.

“That’s it,” Mary finished cussing. “We’re walking from here. Close enough, I think.” She crossed her arms as Zippy unretracted himself from his shell. Beepy also woke up thankfully.

“You’re probably right,” Alex laughed and got out of the car. He would text Snu back later. Yeah, that’d be the cool move. Mary got out and stretched as people walked around her and Alex paid for the parking by waving his hand over the parking meter and didn’t mind the cost. The loot bag Jemin would hopefully help them with weighed a ton. Beepy had to be convinced to come out of the car, but Zippy was already zooming around the street and examining the cursed nut and dried fruit vendor.

Zippy guided Mary by hovering over her shoulder while Alex led the way down the alley and Beepy clung to Mary’s chest. “Smells weird here. Perfect place to bring your new girlfriend after you pick her up in your cool car.”

Alex dodged a pigeon that went for his face with a miniature baseball bat and made another left. “You really think she’ll like it? That’s good, I was thinking more dinner and a fun night out on the town.”

“You should just let me fix your car, you know that?” Mary still used her hand to guide herself along the walls, even with Zippy helping.

“What? You can fix my car?” Alex said while dodging a squishy thing that moved.

“Oh yeah. I could do some very fun experiments,” she said with an evil voice. “It’ll help with my Crafter Guild progression. Give me access to their better shop. You do want me to get rich too. Right, Alex? Right?”

“I mean…it’s a piece of crap anything. Do whatever the heck you want. If it explodes, I get Beepy.”

“Deal!” she fist pumped the air. “And don’t forget, we’re still going to the Merchant Hall later. You gotta pay your taxes if you’re going to be making the big bucks.”

Alex laughed. “Taxes shmaxes. No true service worker who gets tips pays taxes, Mary. Everyone knows that. And I’m going to be the very best. The best at tax evasion.”

“That is not how that works,” Mary said as she adjusted Beepy. “But okay, Grease Lightning. We’ll see how that holds up.”

“Blazing Hot, get it right,” he correct proudly. “And you’re right. I’m kidding. I don’t want the Tax Guild to come down on me. Those guys get paid the big bucks for a reason.”

“Attah–what the hell is that?”

Alex tuned back in and squirted around the garbage laced alley. A strange nasally chanting echoed off the brick walls. For a second he tensed up and felt his Stone Sword in his pocket. Was it an ambush? A summoning? A Monster? Then he spotted them.

Out from behind the garbage can Monster with glued on googly eyes that Jemin kept well fed to keep the critters away emerged a gang of Garden Gnomes. They were chipped and had covered their primary coloring with war paint. About a dozen of them, each barely up to midcalf marched in a loose circle around Alex and Mary as they waved makeshift weapons around.

“Awakener,” they chanted. “Awakener! Great Awakener! Bringer of the Piece! Second, and Lord of Slice!”

One of the gnomes stepped forward with stretched out arms and reverently presented a cold looking piece of pizza that was unmistakably from Ninos. How the heck did it get here? Didn’t he deliver that pie to the Botanical Garden Gnomes? That was all the way across the city. The damn slice still looked pristine if not extremely hot. But the gnome’s eyes were full of fervor to Alex.

“Alex, what the hell is going on? Tell me what’s going on. I can’t see, damnit.”

“Great Awakener,” a gnome that was smaller than the rest said in a high British accent. “You have blessed with a peace accord an–”

“What the System is going on?” Alex interrupted.

That was when the crumbly red painted door creaked open at the end of the alley. A voice rasped from inside.

“Alex?” it called. “Is that you? Are you alone? Are the Gnomes being weird again? They’ve been doing that all night.”

Alex turned and his heart dropped. Jemin stood in the doorway with his scaled arms crossed, one eye squinting suspiciously and the other swollen shut. His lizard face was bruised, blotchy, and covered in welts. The usual relaxed and friendly charisma was cracked. Not gone, but definitely cracked.

“Jemin? What happ–?

“Come inside, quick,” Jemin gestured with what looked like broken claws. “Nice bots, by the way.”

“Oh, uh, thanks,” Mary said as she followed close to Alex into Jemin’s shop. She whispered to him. “He sounds cute. You didn’t tell me he was cute.”

“He’s a lizard, Mary.” Alex responded and sped into the cramped shop. He was worried about his friend. Who had done this? He thought he already knew the answer, but he needed to hear it from Jemin. He'd been hoping that Jemin might help them now with figuring out what was good out of the loot and maybe work with them in the future, but now he needed to look after Jemin.

*This is the Krushers, isn’t it? Fuck.*

“So what? You’re going to take a Dungeon Succubus out on a date soon.”

“You’re what? Alex got a date? No way.” Jemin coughed and ignored the comment as he shut the door behind them all.

The Gnomes hoisted up the pizza, continued their chanting, prayed to the Awakened One, and went back to plotting their next attack. Now that they had ascended their God, their plan could truly begin. The GnOpal had spoken.

But for me specifically there is a problem that is making me doubt if I really want to convert. I live in a very small country and there is only one Orthodox church in the whole country, the church is run by immigrants (Greeks) and all services are in Greek and the priest don't speak English or any language I speak. Also almost everyone in the parish is old and speak only Greek, so it's impossible for me to socialize, there are a few people I can talk with but they apparently are not interested since they leave church once the liturgy is over... Only the greeks stay for coffee after so there is no choice for me other than leave. I fear this will make me more loneliness since I will make no friends of my faith, also I have a dream of getting married soon and that would be just impossible.

I know it may seem silly and many saints endured much worse hardships and still persevered in the faith, but the problem still exists.... i wish i could just pretend it doesn't but that's impossible, has anyone gone through something similar?",4,1746034195.0,OrthodoxChristianity,3,1.0,False

Apparently tomorrow it’s going to be the hottest day so far in the year which is great , but in my case it kinda isn’t.

My studio can get veeeeeery warm in the summer , and I cannot install AC or proper ventilation.
however I have a job to finish and tomorrow is the best day to work on it according to my schedule.
So I thought of spending my day outside of studio , just bringin my laptop somewhere cool where I can spend 4-6 hours starting from 2pm.
I might end up sounding weirdly specific , maybe I am ! (I am) but I’m just looking for suggestions so ride with me please.

Ideal candidate has:

- power outlet for my laptop and soundcard

- it’s somewhat interesting to look at / be in (I don’t wanna be in a generic cafe all afternoon, London is full of great place with cafes , like the VnA for example. Something inspiring basically or as close as)

- it’s not a silent place e.g. library (I work on open headphones which bleed sound a bit, nothing too major but in a dead silent place I would be asked to leave lol)

- it’s not insanely loud e.g. somewhere with live music or loud radio ( open headphones don’t isolate me much)

- (possibly) has AC (I don’t wanna fry)

- has WIFI

- has decently comfortable seating , not a bar stool or I’ll basically die

Bonus points:
Churches , museums , big spaces , brutalist , high ceiling , decent food and coffee

The community center’s multipurpose room was buzzing with chatter and the smell of freshly brewed coffee. Every Thursday, the center hosted “Open Talent Day” for seniors—an easygoing event filled with poetry readings, storytelling, and the occasional off-key rendition of Sinatra classics.

Eleanor Martin, 78, had lived in Maplewood all her life. Widowed for almost a decade and with her two children living out of state—one in Oregon and the other all the way out in Florida—she spent most of her days reading mystery novels and tending to the flower beds in her small backyard. But this Thursday, she’d finally worked up the nerve to attend the talent day. Not because she thought she was especially gifted, but because she had promised her late husband, George, that she’d stop hiding from the world.

She walked in quietly, wearing a soft gray cardigan and carrying a folded music sheet tucked inside her worn leather purse.

“Hey, Eleanor!” chirped Mary, a lively 72-year-old who organized the event. “We were just about to have some fun. Want to play us a little something?”

Eleanor blushed. “Oh, I don’t know. It’s been years…”

That’s when Larry, the local jokester who never missed a Thursday, pointed to the old upright piano in the corner. It had been sitting in that same spot since 1963 and hadn’t been tuned since the Bush administration—**the first Bush administration.**

“How about you give that thing a try, Eleanor?” Larry chuckled. “Fair warning—it’s more of a conversation piece than an instrument these days.”

Laughter rippled through the room. Just a harmless joke. But something inside Eleanor stirred.

She walked over to the piano slowly, her fingers already tingling with an instinct that hadn’t been used in years. She opened the lid—hinges creaking—and revealed a row of yellowed, uneven keys. A couple were missing. One had duct tape on it.

Eleanor sat down, adjusted the old bench (which wobbled a bit), and laid her fingers on the keys. The room grew still.

She didn’t warm up. Didn’t say a word. She closed her eyes, and the first few notes of *Clair de Lune* floated out into the room.

The piano groaned and buzzed from years of neglect. The lower G key stuck slightly. But Eleanor’s hands—aged yet elegant—moved with care and precision. She played around the flaws. She filled the gaps with feeling. Her tempo slowed ever so slightly at the rough parts, letting the imperfections become part of the expression.

It was beautiful. Worn and warm. Just like her.

By the second minute, no one made a sound. Coffee cups sat untouched. Forks hovered over slices of store-bought apple pie. One woman in the back started crying softly.

By the final note, even Larry had taken off his Cleveland Browns cap and was holding it respectfully in his lap.

Then came the applause—louder than anyone expected from a room full of seniors. Eleanor blinked, surprised, and gave a bashful smile.

Mary rushed over. “Eleanor, that was… stunning. Where on earth did you learn to play like that?”

Eleanor looked down at her hands. “I played in church when I was young. Then in college. I was even in a jazz trio for a bit. But after George and I got married, I stopped. Life just got busy.”

Mr. Caldwell, a retired music teacher sitting by the coffee table, spoke up. “That wasn’t just music. That was a masterclass in soul. That piano isn’t even in tune—but you made it sing.”

From that day forward, Eleanor became the unofficial highlight of Talent Day. She offered short lessons before performances and helped lead a fundraiser to fix the piano. Within three months, the community had raised over **$1,200** to get it tuned and repaired. A local craftsman even donated time to refinish the wood.

It still wasn’t a Steinway, but to the folks of Maplewood, it might as well have been.

Even more surprising? A visitor that day had filmed the performance and uploaded it to Facebook and YouTube under the title:

**“A Simple Woman Told To Play A Broken Piano As A Joke, Then Her Talent SHOCKS The Room”**

The video went viral. People from as far away as California, Texas, and even Canada left comments praising Eleanor’s grace, emotion, and resilience. Some said they were inspired to dust off their own instruments. One man, a veteran in Arizona, said it reminded him of the music his wife used to play before she passed.

Eleanor never asked for fame. But each Thursday, she still walks—carefully, using her walker now—into the community center, where her seat at the piano is always ready.

She plays not for praise, but because music, like people, doesn't have to be perfect to be powerful.

And as Maplewood learned, sometimes the most beautiful performances come from the most unexpected places.",1,1746034036.0,u_Any-Newspaper-7393,0,1.0,False

1kbm41d,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kbm41d/ro_a_college_girls_summer/,[RO] A College Girl’s Summer,"Last summer, I would’ve reached for my phone and texted Juan everything about my adventures. Today, I resisted the urge to pick up my phone and give him a call. Exams had ended, May and June were gone, and July was underway. I hadn’t heard from him since.

*He doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. Maybe we weren’t as close as I thought. Perhaps I made a mistake.*

My mind drifted back to the last day I saw him, trying to figure out what could have happened between now and then.

*“Juan, I don’t want to be anxious anymore. I don’t want to study all the time. I want to let loose. Forget about physics. Let’s have some fun. Brad told me he and a couple of our classmates were going out to wrap up the year. Let’s join them.”*

*“Alright then, Aisha. I’m at the coffee shop across from campus. Come pick me up.”*

I had pulled my blue sedan into the lot, pop music blaring from the radio, and waited for him to come out. The parking job had been  excellent; my tires were half in the spot next to me.

Juan had come out and got in the passenger seat, his brown eyes shining in the dark, scruffy beard hiding his grin.

*“I was just talking to Cameron, and it looks like we weren’t the only ones who got screwed over. Let’s pray for a curve later. Let’s go enjoy the night now.”*

***Cameron got screwed over too? The embodiment of calm, cool, and collected? The guy who made solving complex equations look like a walk in the park?***

*“Cameron? Where’s Cameron? Is he at home already? Let’s go pick him up.”*

As if on cue, a notification from Cameron popped up—a selfie of him, jaw tense, lips curled into a frown, but eyes seemingly amused.

Cameron was the only guy who could make me smile without saying a word.

Once, though, he had let his guard down. The front and serious act had disappeared.

*“Let’s play hooky. Just the two of us. I can teach you combinatorics later,”* he’d said to me on a Wednesday afternoon.

It had seemed so out of character for him that I had to agree.

Usually, on our walks to class, I chattered away while he silently listened, but that day he flipped the script.

He’d hung up on every call that came through asking him where we were. For once, I’d also ignored Juan’s calls and messages.

On the way to the beach, we’d spotted an ice cream shop. 

Grabbing my hand, he’d said, *“Let’s get ice cream, on me.”*

I’d ordered cherry-vanilla, and he ordered rum and chocolate chip.

Back in the present day I snapped back a reply of me grinning from ear to ear, my eyes squinted.  

*I do not hide my feelings.*

I wonder what will happen when I see them both come September.

Since I joined my fathers company 2 years ago I very quickly realized that the is narcisstic. (I had the assumption that he was like that before I joined, because we haven‘t had very much contact so I didn‘t know 100%). Since I joined I worked 24/7, so 0 days off or days off when sick (except one time when my mother persuaded him). Everytime when he is around I‘ll get yelled at for his mistakes or tiny things that aren‘t a big deal. One time I SAID, DONT YELLED: don‘t scream at me like that and after that he screamed at me for 3 minutes that he can yell at me whenever he wants and I have no right to scream(???) at him. A day later my mother told me that he told her that if I ever say that again to him, he would hit and punch me (he did once I think when I was way younger and still a kid) . So now I‘m sometimes afraid to say something to him. I also don’t get payed. When then a tiny little bit. We built a house for 2 1/2 years for us. Everytime I went there to work and help him he screamed at me for literally nothing. He threw stuff around like always because he‘s agressive and when he did something wrong I was guilty for it as always. He hurt me 2-3 times there too (I think not intentional) but I now have 2 wounds, one time from him drilling in my finger when I was holding something and then 1 minute after that grinning and saying; go make me a coffee; yeah, as I was standing there bleeding with a little hole in my finger. Today we did something on the roof, I knew how it would turn out. He said that I am a complete idiot because of nothing and that I am like a girl (??). I said after that that I won‘t work any longer today because of this behaviour and then he said yeah I will get you to work, but I said no repeatedly and then he gave up luckily.

I just want to live my life as I want, I want to habe free time like the co-workers, the take 1-2 months off no problem but when I want a weekend or 1 week off no that‘s not happening. The thing is my parents pay for my car and I don‘t need to pay rent what I‘m unbelieveably greatful for but I want to be alone all my dreams I had are gone I just want to live a normal life with my girlfriend who lives 3 hours away and I mostly don‘t have time for when she visits me sometime because ""there‘s always something to do"". I can‘t visit her because I don‘t have weekends. i can feel my mental health going down a lot. I just want to LEAVE AND NEVER COME BACK. 😔Also I‘m in my 20ies and am a really calm, quiet and hard-working person.

tl;dr: I joined my ndads company, he is always yelling at me when he does mistakes and hurts me and I don‘t get no freetime even when I‘m sick, coworkers get freetime whenever they want, I don‘t have time for my private life and can‘t visit my long distance girlfriend because there always something to do. I want to leave and have my own life but I can‘t because I don‘t get payed (sometimes a little bit but my salary is at the lowest that you can get) and have no money to move and pay my car and rent and other stuff.

She was fighting stage four cancer & was disabled & she was such an inspiration. This was one of her last 10 tattoos before she passed & im so happy her art & life is immortalized in the tattoo. & we ended up going to the same highschool even though I got the tattoo in a different state !! We really connected & I admired her sooo much. Had another session booked with her but got canceled because she went on hospice. Rest in peace legend. 

This being said , am I cooked lmfao ? I guess I'm really just looking for advice on how to accept that tattoos age & look worse over time. Maybe brain storm solutions so I don't get insanely flamed by my Russo-Jewish family. ",11,1746033608.0,tattooscratchers,12,0.92,False

Dear Friends and Neighbors,

Over the past months, I have been so deeply moved by the conversations, support, and energy that you all have shared with me. Running for Saint Paul City Council in Ward 4 has been one of the most inspiring experiences of my life. Thank you for your financial contributions and your time and energy to this campaign.

Through our Coffee Connects, community events, and conversations, we have dreamed together about a thriving, vibrant, and affordable Saint Paul. I am especially grateful to all of you who believed in my leadership and shared your hopes for our community so openly.

Most importantly, you shared with me what was important to you in the next City Council member for Ward 4. Someone who would lead, work towards solutions, and give voice to every community in Ward 4, giving it the attention it deserves and being in community.

After much reflection, I have made the decision to conclude my campaign for City Council. This was not an easy choice, but it is one I make with clarity and hope for the future of Ward 4.

I am proud to endorse Molly Coleman for Saint Paul City Council. I believe she has the leadership acumen, time, heart, and commitment needed to serve Ward 4 with the care and presence it deserves. Molly knows this city deeply, and has built her career around coalition-building and genuine community connection. She will carry that work forward in the City Council.

This moment is not an ending — it’s a transition into continuing the work we have started, together. I remain committed to being an advocate, a neighbor, and a partner in building the strong, connected Saint Paul we all believe in.

I hope you will join me in supporting Molly Coleman and staying engaged in the important conversations ahead. Your voice and your vision are vital to shaping our future.

With deep gratitude and continued commitment,

1kblzd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1kblzd9/how_people_have_time_to_do_it_all_long_post/,How people have time to do it all (Long post),"Time is tricky. It’s both valuable and slippery, and many people struggle with carving out time for what they care about.

You’re also not going to feel good about yourself If you know or see someone who seems to do it all.

I want to show you how those people do it, and how the answers are much more underwhelming and accessible than you might think.

(The person you know/admire may do some or all of these things, but these are the patterns I have noticed)

**They spend less time on more things:**

It doesn’t take much to cross the beginner stage and impress people. If you spend 20 to 30 minutes on something three times a week and keep at it for a couple of years, people will think you’re decent at it.

This means you can spend one hour on three things, three times a week, and be seen as decent in all of them by most people.

Meanwhile, someone else spends one hour on one thing and only earns one trophy. The diminishing returns of expertise don’t help much either.

The illusion comes from this: because you’re not an expert in the hobbies of the person you admire, you assume they are more competent than they are and therefore you make the conclusion that they must have had more time.

In reality, they spend less time on more things.

(In some cases, they are competent as you deem them to be, but they also spent 5 years' worth of effort on it spread out over 10.)

**They had years of practice:**

This is really important to understand. Being able to maintain a habit, hobby, or side project that takes 10 to 30 minutes a day in its maintenance phase probably took years of messy, unproductive trial and error.

Any project demands an order of magnitude more time and resources at the start than in its maintenance phase.

Sure, it only takes them a short amount of time now, but it didn’t before, now they have efficient systems in place.

If you have 5 to 10 years and you want to be good at 3 to 5 things, you can start with one thing and reach its maintenance stage in a year or two. Then you add the second thing, and so on.

Before you know it, you’ll be a “master of time management.” where you can do all these things without breaking a sweat, and someone looking from the outside won’t understand how you perform that way.

**They delegate/automate:**

If you can spend one to two hours automating something you’ll never have to think about again, like bill payments or subscriptions, why not set it up?

You can get groceries delivered and drastically reduce your trips to the store. Keep a list of the items you care about and get those yourself, but let someone else handle the rest.

Also, get a roomba!

If you think this is too much, you’re right, it is. But people have sacrificed even more. They hire nannies, virtual assistants, and services of all kinds. What I suggested is just the tip of the iceberg.

If someone seems to be “doing it all,” maybe they’re doing one or two things they care about and is visible to the masses while delegating or automating the invisible, less impactful tasks. It’s more common than you think.

**They had minimal starting conditions**

Let’s say you want to write, draw, learn a language, or lose weight. Chances are you’ve set conditions that you think are “reasonable” for starting.

For many productive people, the starting conditions are much simpler (and sometimes dirtier). Most of our conditions are luxuries in disguise.

You may want a quiet place to write; they started writing on their phone while on the subway. You may need decent materials to draw; they used a regular notebook during lunch breaks.

At first, these setups are sneaky, messy, and barely functional. You’ll question if they’re even worth it.

But that’s only the case in the beginning. Over time, the process becomes more convenient, but that convenience only comes after starting under unfavorable conditions.

**They cared more than the pain**

This isn’t a motivational post. It’s about the basics of how the human mind makes a decision. Caring isn’t enough, you need to care more than the cost of the action.

Are you okay with spending money you don’t have to automate something you think is a luxury, just to carve out enough time to do something small and “pathetic”?

For some, the answer is yes. You need to care enough to tolerate the cost. Not everyone has that clarity or drive, but it’s important to view the person you admire within the context of their life, not yours.

This is not to paint their motivation in a good light, sometimes it’s healthy, other times it’s not, because they may dread or deeply dislike the situation so much that the pain of change pales in comparison.

If you were running for your life because a bear was chasing you, you wouldn’t care much about how tiresome running is, right?

**They follow a structure, sometimes blindly:**

I don’t want to talk too much about this but the general idea is this: the person knows exactly what to do and when to do it. For example, piano practice for 30 minutes at 8 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That’s it.

The focus isn’t necessarily on how well they perform during the practice, it’s about going through the motions. Simply having a clearly defined routine cuts out so much of the guesswork and friction that can derail action. The simpler the structure, the better.

Motivation and discipline will always fluctuate, but the brain thrives on routines and cues. A solid routine provides stability and consistency, even when your willpower is low.

Think about how much of a hassle walking would be if you had to consciously plan every movement. Sometimes, blindly following a set routine works in your favor.

**They're not that good at managing their time:**

This might seem weird, but many people who seem to do it all, don’t really do it all, sometimes they’re procrastinating in a different way than you do.

A common example that you may relate to is procrastinating on the work you need to do by doing work that is more appealing.

The same principle applies here, Maybe they’re neglecting crucial areas for others, maybe that's their way of coping with their emotions.

Everyone procrastinates, maybe not in the same way and to the same extent that you do it, but everyone does it in some way.

**Energy matters more than you think**

You can cut down a lot of effort just by eating right, sleeping right, and exercising right. Ask the person you admire what their energy levels are like.

Low energy is insidious. You might take twice the time to finish a task, only to realize it didn’t need to be done at all. Your priorities can become a mess, your patience gets halved, and your ability to learn, think, or articulate becomes impaired, you also need twice the amount of time to rest and catch up. A cup of coffee won’t fix all that.

Time management is rarely just about time. Energy always plays a role. You don’t have to take my word for it, just think about how much you got done on a day you felt rested. How pleasant was the experience? How “locked in” were you?

Your best day is some people’s default state.

That's it, that’s the underwhelming trick.

A good day where you sleep well, eat well, delegate the things you hate, and focus on the things you enjoy suddenly feels incredibly productive and you end the day motivated for the next.

1kblyft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1kblyft/this_isnt_the_life_i_imagined_as_a_husband_and/,This isn't the life I imagined as a husband and father,"I wake up at 6 a.m. and get ready to be on time for work. To save time, I skip breakfast and eat a protein bar with some coffee at work. At work, I realize I’m falling behind, so I skip my break and keep working. Around 4 or 5 p.m., I notice I was supposed to finish by 4, but I'm not done yet. I stay a bit longer to complete my tasks. At 5 p.m., I leave work and head to the car. I call my wife and ask what she did during the day. She scolds me for not calling her before 5 and complains that I could’ve waited until she woke up. She asks what I did during my break, and I explain I didn’t take one—I kept working. She nags like a mother because I haven’t eaten all day. I explain that otherwise I wouldn’t be able to keep up, but she doesn’t seem to care. We argue until I reach the car. I hang up because I need to open the windows—the air conditioning hasn't worked in ages—and I can’t hear her complaining with the windows down.

I get home and park. I sigh, knowing what’s about to come. Then I pull the key out and turn off the engine. As I walk home, I hear my little daughter screaming, and the sound pierces my ears. When I open the door, I see my wife did her hair. I give her a compliment and try to lighten the mood. I play with our daughter. My wife is still upset with me. I explain that I just didn’t have time, but she doesn’t care—she keeps complaining that I didn’t call and that I didn’t eat. This goes on until we put our daughter to bed around 7 or 8 p.m. In the evening, I play on the computer for an hour, then get ready for bed and go to sleep around 10 or 11 p.m.—only to live the same day again tomorrow.

Five days a week.
I used to be able to work from home, but that’s no longer possible because my daughter keeps knocking on the door and my wife either complains when I say I’m busy or constantly asks me for ""just one minute"" every ten minutes, distracting me from my work. Because of this, I started having problems at work, and to avoid losing my job, I now commute one hour each way every day.

On weekends, when I think I can finally relax for five minutes, I either have chores to do in the apartment or have to drive from one store to another because my wife can’t decide whether to buy the table in dark or light wood—as if it even matters. Or my parents call, and my wife forces us to go see them. I feel like a 12-year-old being dragged to visit relatives.

Somehow, this isn’t what I imagined life would be like as a father and husband. I feel like I’m stuck in an elevator with endless elevator music, just waiting for the door to finally open so I can step out.",82,1746033460.0,Marriage,127,0.78,False

If we eat the exact same amount of calories per day, it would take me twice as long as him to reach my goal. If it's 6 months for him, it's a year for me. 

The whole allure of OMAD is that it's ""hard to reach your calorie limit in just one meal"", but that's not true for me. At the moment, my calorie limit is only 1200 per day. I'd still have to strategize when going to restaurants, and I can't make myself a feast at the end of the day. I also know that I trick myself by saying I'll exercise, but I never do. Even if I committed to working out, I want to make a plan that allots for me being pretty sedentary.

So, as a beginner, how do I stop craving breakfast? I'm not a fan of green tea or black coffee, is there anything (possibly with electrolytes) I can drink during fasts? I heard that lemon water is alright, but I'm still confused about zero calorie beverages. And, finally, how do other short women deal with the restraints on your daily meal while still feeling satisfied? 

Any other beginner tips are appreciated! I'm going to try my hardest at this, but I need advice.",4,1746033404.0,omad,8,1.0,False

These laptops. They keep disappearing. Every time a remote employee leaves, they just *absorb* the company laptop into their personal inventory like we’re living in a damn RPG. We lock them. We wipe them. But the hardware? Gone. Vanished. Like an angel’s whisper or my last shred of trust in humanity.

This has become deeply personal. I haven't blinked in three days. My therapist blocked my number. I needed help—**real** help. So I hired a guy.

His name is **Stephen**.  
Pronounced *Ste-ffff-in*.  
If you say it without the “ffff,” he will correct you.  
If you *refuse* to say it with the “ffff”? He *might* flip a table.

We were at a coffee shop last week. The barista called out “Steven?” and I swear to God, I saw Stephen’s soul leave his body, do pushups in the air, and come back angrier. He just stood there, whispering “Ste. FFFF. In.” under his breath like a cursed spell. Then he stared at the barista for a solid 30 seconds and said, “You almost compromised this entire perimeter.”  
People *left the shop.* One guy dropped his scone and ran.

That’s when I knew I had the right man.

Stephen says he’s ex-Navy SEAL “adjacent.” I don’t know what that means. He wears tactical socks and once referred to himself as a “logistical phantom.” He told me he studied “Advanced Disappearance” at “the academy,” but he didn’t say which one. He also once called HDMI ports “data chakras.”

We’ve started what he calls **Operation Reclaim the Machine**. I carry a clipboard and a bodycam now. Stephen calls it “combat accounting.” He’s drawn diagrams—mostly arrows and stick figures stealing laptops with devil horns. One of them is named Greg. I think Greg used to work here.

What’s worked for you all? I'm serious. If one more laptop goes missing, Stephen says we’re “escalating to psy-ops,” and I’m starting to believe he knows what that means.

Please. Share your success stories. Before Stephen builds another “training obstacle” in my living room.",18,1746033149.0,ShittySysadmin,14,1.0,False

24f here! I met this guy (37–40m) on the tram on Monday. I noticed he kept shyly glancing over at me from even before he got on. When he came in, he stood a bit of a distance away, but eventually, when a seat opened up in my line of sight, he sat there. Thus began a few minutes of cute glances. I eventually started laughing because it was cute and he was being so obvious about it.

I decided to write him a post-it note saying:

“Hi there! I see you shyly looking over here, my name is X. Let’s grab coffee sometime!
My number”

We met up the next day, and it was like he was mesmerized or something—he seemed so happy and giddy. The conversation flowed easily, and he gently caressed my hands as we talked. I’d definitely say there was chemistry. Even when he guided me with his arm behind me as we crossed the street, I didn’t feel uncomfortable—which is rare when I’ve just met someone.

He called me sexy and used other flattering adjectives, which made me blush lol.

We talked about our childhoods, our current lives, goals, and motivations. I feel like I talked a lot, but he was happy to listen while holding my hand on the table. He was very attentive and gentle. I don’t know his exact age, but I’d guess we’re about 10–15+ years apart.

I went home happy and giggly and couldn’t sleep that night thinking about him. We were supposed to meet again today, but he had to reschedule due to work.

I’m currently a master’s student and still working toward stability, while he already owns a company and is well-established. I’ve been thinking about whether I might be too immature for him or whether we’re aligned in terms of life direction. We did connect over childhood stuff and work in the same professional ecosystem—just at different stages.

I’ve struggled with depression, but I met him during a good period. Still, I can’t help but wonder if I’m “enough” for him or if I’m “woman enough.” He lived with a previous partner for six years, and they ended things mutually. He doesn’t see the point of marriage, but I do want to get married and have kids one day.

Even though we’ve only met once, I feel like we really vibe, and I want to get to know him more. I’m trying to figure out whether this connection is worth exploring despite the age gap. I don’t want to rush into anything, but I’m also curious about what to consider when two people are at very different life stages.

Edit: Also I’m a virgin and I’ve only had one or two relationships in my life and intimacy scares me sometimes. I really don’t want to be used I just want to find someone I can be myself with and enjoy their company.

What would be a good way to move forward and stay grounded while getting to know him? I’m also wondering if folks in that age group would take women my age seriously.",1,1746033102.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

I will post a few examples of plots I’ve been thinking about but I am open to discuss further together for something else, my only but, is that I don’t do fantasy roles.

BTW!!! I write in first person and want my partner to do so as well!

1: Professional athlete / Wife.

He’s a rising star in professional sports—football, basketball, soccer, or whatever suits your world. Known for his talent, drive, and charisma, he’s constantly under the public eye. She’s been by his side since before the fame—his wife, best friend, and grounding force.

But with fame comes pressure.

Late nights. Media scandals. Temptation. Long stretches apart. Whispers of infidelity. She’s proud of his success, but she’s beginning to feel like she’s living in his shadow—losing herself in the process. He says nothing has changed, but his world is spinning faster than ever.

2, Childhood best friends who reunite

You and I were inseparable as kids—neighbors, classmates, and the kind of best friends who shared everything, even the dream of one day leaving the small town behind. But just before our senior year, X (optional ) left without warning. No explanation. No goodbye. Y (optional) was devastated—and confused, especially since something had just begun to shift between us… something that felt like it could’ve been love.

Now, 7 years later, fate pulls us back to the same place.

3, Exes who reunites

We were each other’s first real love. Passionate, reckless, and deeply connected—but the relationship fell apart years ago in a storm of misunderstandings, unspoken fears, or betrayal. Since then, we’ve lived separate lives—maybe in different cities, with different people, or chasing different dreams.

But fate has a funny way of throwing people back together.

Now, years later, we cross paths again. It could be at a mutual friend’s wedding, a funeral, a work event, or even randomly in a coffee shop or airport. Time has passed, but the tension is still there. So is the chemistry.

4, Kingdom rivalry with an arranged marriage

Two rival kingdoms have been at odds for generations. Our lands share a border scarred by years of war, betrayal, and broken treaties. Both thrones sit heavy with ambition, fear, and pride. Now, a fragile peace treaty is proposed to end the bloodshed… but no one trusts it to last.

To seal the truce, a royal marriage is arranged between the heirs of each kingdom. Neither of us wants it. We’re strangers raised to see each other as enemies. But duty demands compliance.

Ever find yourself gazing blankly at your computer screen, counting down until you can curl up on the couch? 😴 The infamous *afternoon slump*—it's real, and it's brutal. But what if I told you there's a super simple trick that can zap you back into action in just **2 minutes**? Seriously, it’s like magic. 🪄

**Here's the scoop:** Last week, I stumbled across a breathing technique that (*surprise, surprise*) claims to combat the afternoon slump. I thought, why not? Let’s see if this is just another internet fad or a real game-changer.

🔹 **The Technique: 4-7-8 Breathing**

1. **Inhale** through your nose for a count of 4.
2. **Hold** your breath for a count of 7.
3. **Exhale** through your mouth for a count of 8.
4. **Repeat** 3-4 times.

Super simple, right? But does it actually work?  😏

**Here’s what happened:** By the third day of trying this, post-lunch drowsiness was no longer my nemesis. Instead of zombie-walking to the coffee machine, I was feeling noticeably refreshed! 🚀 The best part? I didn’t need to sacrifice my precious coffee break—this just added a bit more zen to the mix.

The science-y bit: This technique helps calm the nervous system, which not only boosts energy but also promotes focus. It's like an espresso shot, minus the jitters! ☕️✨

So, why not replace that 22nd doom-scroll of the day with this quick reset? You'll find it surprisingly powerful, inspiring a renewed sense of focus and calm. And hey, maybe you’ll finally get around to organizing that desk drawer you’ve been side-eyeing for the past month.

Have any of you tried breathing exercises to battle your afternoon dip? I’d love to hear your experiences or any other nifty tricks you’ve got hidden up your sleeve. Let’s keep the energy flowing! 🌊

Friends of mine started the business; naturally I went in support. I arrived just as LaMafia was graciously allowing patrons into the business, yet looming still, as if allowing passage by the collection of photo-shoots as toll. I brushed past the couple folk who were posing with LaMafia at the moment, and entered. Upon solidifying my spot in the queue, I about-faced, walked outside, right up to LaMafia, and called him a traitor. We exchanged some words and went our separate ways.

The tree stood where it always did, surrounded by brown grass and dirt. It stood straight as an arrow, wide as a school bus. If you looked for the top of it, it would seem as if it never stopped—perhaps it didn’t.

There sat the boy. Scuffed-up sneakers and oversized, stain-filled rags covered his body. His legs were pretzeled together as he leaned against the tree, digging his hands into the dirt. The coldness of the earth made him feel comfy. He felt the wiggling of worms between his fingers—slimy little noodles thrashing around in his hands. It made him laugh. And hungry.

He toyed with the Velcro straps on his shoes, feeling the warm air gently tussle his hair and shirt. The breeze brought the smell of rotten eggs, dog poop, and the stinging sensation of a skunk. Typical.

He opened up his pack and pulled out some broken crayons and an old notebook. Flipping to an empty page, he began to draw. As he created, his tummy growled: a picnic table full of grapes and sandwiches, potato chips, and chocolate milk to wash it all down. For dessert, he drew a cherry pie with his bright red crayon.

As he finished coloring in the pie, his mouth started to water and his stomach twisted and stretched inside him. He laid back against the tree and closed his eyes. Tears began to form, and his arm wiped them away just as quickly as they sprouted. He took a deep breath and… something strange happened. A smell entered his nose—a good one.

He sat up and looked around. Nothing. Yet the scent remained: fresh-baked cherry pie. The smell grew stronger, and his stomach grew angrier. He stood up and looked around. Who would have a picnic here? He must be going crazy—his teacher always did say his daydreaming was out of control.

He looked back at his drawing and shook his head. They’ll be looking for me soon, he thought. Maybe I want them to find me this time. He was hungry, after all.

He stood, wiping the dirt from his shorts with the dirt on his hands. As he started walking back, he looped around the tree and, for the first time, realized how wide it truly was. It felt like forever to walk around it. When he reached the other side, he saw a hole at the bottom of the tree. It was just about his size sitting down, arched like a round door. The bark on the inside was bright red—almost cherry-colored.

He peeked his head inside and looked around. Everything was red, and the bark seemed soft—squishy, almost. He poked it with a dirty finger. Solid. What did he expect? A tree made of cherry filling? That’s what Ms. Harper had warned him about.

Still, the tree made him smile. He sat on his butt, back to the tree, and scooted himself backward into the hollow, pretending it was a spaceship. He closed his eyes and thrashed around in the hollow, fighting aliens, using thrusters and boosts to escape laser beams. He laughed and shouted, plummeting through space.

His eyes opened instantly when the scent hit him again—fainter, but still strong enough to make him question reality. He decided to crawl out of the tree and leave. His belly couldn’t handle this torture anymore.

As he stood, he almost screamed. His heart raced when he looked down and saw bright green grass engulfing his sneakers. All around him was green and white—dandelions and grass stretched out forever. He was surprised by his own imagination. If I close my eyes tight enough and open them again, he thought, this will all be gone. So, he didn’t close them.

He looped around the big tree that somehow felt even larger this time. As he walked, he scanned the rest of the area—only grass. No other trees, no houses, no animals. That struck him as odd. There were no birds chirping, no buzzing bugs—just the breeze and the rustling of leaves.

As he rounded the tree, his heart nearly stopped.

A huge lake sprawled out before him, stretching as far as he could see. The water was completely still. When he walked closer, he couldn’t see through it. It was like a mirror. In it, he saw clouds, the sun—and his own reflection. But something was different.

His reflection smiled back at him, wearing clean clothes and a big grin.

Startled, he stumbled backward and hit a root, landing hard on the grass. He dug his hands into the earth. No worms, no dirt—just more grass. He pulled and pulled until his fingers were green and his nails packed with grass. His breathing sped up, sweat forming on his brow.

Enough, he thought, and shut his eyes tightly. He waited. Then opened them.

The lake was in front of him still, the torn-up grass was all over his shoes. His eyes started to water. He wiped away the tears and decided it must be the hollow. He popped up, brushed himself off, and before he could turn around, he heard it.

The voice that made his heart plop into his stomach.

“Oh, there you are.”

He turned around slowly, unsure of what to do. He could run. But where? He could scream. Who would hear it? The first thing he saw was an unlaced tie and a white dress shirt. Black pants and freshly polished black shoes. The boy moved his eyes up to the man’s face. He had green eyes and dark hair, a freshly shaved face with a friendly smile on his lips.

The boy said, “Who are you?”

There was a pause. “We’ve been looking for you all over. My wife—she was worried we wouldn’t be able to see you.”

“How do you know me?”

A pause.

The man chuckled and said, “Well, we figured if we left this pie out long enough, you’d be coming over looking for a slice. Would you like one?”

The boy wanted to run at first. It didn’t matter where—he just knew he should be afraid. But he wasn’t. There was a sense of warmth filling his body, and he couldn’t help but want a slice.

He hesitated and said, “Where do you live?”

“Right around the tree! But I’m sure you know not to go into strangers’ houses—you look like a smart boy. I’ll go grab the pie and my wife. She can’t wait to see you. You can have some fruit in the meantime.”

The man walked behind the tree, and the boy watched until the man was gone.
A few moments passed, and he mustered up the courage to move. He figured he would find the hollow and go back home. As he was making his way around the tree, he could smell the pie again. It was stronger this time. His stomach started gurgling and twisting.

When he got to the other side, he couldn’t believe it.

The man wasn’t lying.

Right in front of the hollow lay a checkered blanket with a big pitcher of lemonade and a picnic basket filled with apples and grapes. A plate of bread sat there, and it filled his nose with the scent of fresh baking.

Out of instinct, he ran over to the blanket, plopped down, and was about to grab a piece of bread when he hesitated.

What if it’s poisoned? What if it’s not real? What if none of this is real?

That made his eyes water again. Before he could wipe them, he heard a soft voice. A woman’s voice.

“Oh, there he is! You look so handsome today!”

She wore a white dress with blue flowers on it. She was barefoot and had shoulder-length light brown hair and red lipstick. Her smile was warm and inviting, and in her hands was the pie.

“I know you must be starving. Have some fruit and bread. Then after, you can have as many slices as you want. I know that’s why you’re here.” She gave an assuring smile just as the man came back with a duffle bag. He put it down next to the blanket and sat. He grabbed a piece of bread, cut it in half, and buttered it up.

The man noticed that the boy wouldn’t take his eyes off the bag, so he said, “Oh, that? It’s for after lunch. I have a surprise for you.”

He thought nothing tasted better than the bread… until he had the fruit. The grapes were fat, green, and exploded with flavor every time he bit into one. If this wasn’t real, then he didn’t want to live in the real world. He wanted this—always.

The boy was still hesitant of the adults, and he mostly kept quiet during lunch. Every now and then he would lock eyes with the lady. She would smile, and he would look away.

When the time came for the lady to cut into the pie, he realized he must’ve eaten too much, because he couldn’t bring himself to take a bite. This was all he wanted a moment ago. Now the smell of it made him want to barf.

The woman didn’t get upset or tell him he had to eat it. She just smiled gently and said, “You don’t have to eat it now. We can always save it for later. I think he’s ready for you now.”

The boy looked over to where the man had been sitting—but he wasn’t there. The bag was gone too.

Then he heard a whistle.

He looked over, and the man was standing there with two baseball mitts and a ball.

“Let’s see how good your arm is, bud!” the man said with pure joy in his eyes.

The boy looked to the lady and put his head down.

“What’s wrong? You don’t like baseball?” Her voice was soft and low, as if she could feel what he was feeling.

Before he could respond, she added, “It’s okay. He’ll teach you. Go have fun.”

She started to clean up the picnic area, and the boy nervously walked over toward the man.

The glove was a perfect fit. He had to be shown how to put it on, how to throw the ball, and how to catch it with the glove. But it all came easily to him. Within minutes, he was catching the ball and smiling.

The man never got angry, never cursed when the boy dropped the ball. He just told him to try again and gave him tips on what to do. They were making jokes and laughing. The boy felt like he could do this forever.

As the sun began to set, the man looked down at his wrist and said, “Oh, we better get inside soon. She should have supper ready by now.”

Supper? Didn’t we just have lunch? the boy thought. But his stomach was grumbling again at the mention of more food.

“Where do you live?” he asked.

The man chuckled. “Right behind you, silly. You haven’t noticed our home yet?”

The boy turned around.

Right where the picnic blanket had been, now stood a big white house with a green door. There was a garden in the front yard, filled with bright-colored flowers of all kinds.

As they walked up the porch steps, the man looked down and said, “Oh. Your shoes—you should take those off here. They’ve got grass all over them. And they’re in bad shape. I have a pair for you.”

The boy took his shoes off and followed the man into the house.

He sat on the couch in the living room, waiting. The smell of supper filled the air and made his mouth water. The man returned, sitting at the coffee table with a shoebox on his lap. He opened it.

“Here, these are your size.”

The boy looked inside. White shoes with red trim. Brand new.

He looked down.

“I can’t wear these… they have laces.”

The man looked confused. “Can’t? Hmm. We’ll have to see about that.”

He put one of the shoes on the boy’s foot and said, “Watch closely.” He began to tie the laces slowly, explaining each step so the boy could follow. Then he put the other shoe on and handed the laces to him.

“Now it’s your turn,” he said, smiling.

The boy’s heart started to thump again. He couldn’t do it. He just knew he couldn’t.

“I believe in you, buddy,” the man said, as if reading his thoughts.

The boy tried.

Then he tried again.

And then—he did it. He really did it. He tied his own shoe!

“Look at that. You did that all on your own. I’m really proud of you, bud.”

Something was happening inside him. He started to breathe heavy, and his eyes began to water—but he wasn’t sad. He looked up at the man. Before he could say anything, the man smiled and said, “Let’s go eat. You can tell her what you just did.”
Supper was fantastic. Every bite was better than the last, and to top it off—there was still pie left. This time, he couldn’t stop eating it. He must have had at least three slices.

The woman laughed and said, “You’re really building up an appetite. I’m glad.”

That night, she tucked him into bed.

He had a room here. His own room.

There were superhero posters on the walls, a box full of toys, and a shelf loaded with picture books and comics. He picked one before bed and flipped through the pages, studying the images as his eyelids grew heavy.

She sat next to him for a moment and watched. He noticed tears on her face, and his chest tightened.

“What’s wrong?” he asked.

She smiled and wiped her face. “Nothing. Nothing at all. I’m just glad I get to see you today. Tell me about the story you’re reading.”

He looked back at the pages and said, “Well… there’s superheroes, and they’re fighting, but… I don’t know what it says.”

“Oh. Maybe I can help.”

She laid next to him and began teaching him some of the words.

He fell asleep quickly. The feel of freshly cleaned sheets, the quiet neatness of the room—it was cozy. Safe.

But when he woke the next morning, something felt different.

The sheets didn’t feel the same. There was an odd smell. He heard the ruckus of kids and adults downstairs.

When he opened his eyes, he saw the bottom of a second bunk above him. He dug his face into the pillow.

This time, he couldn’t wipe the tears away.

After school, he ran to the tree.

His thoughts were running wild as he saw it in the distance.

What if I can’t find them?

What if they don’t want me anymore?

What if they’re not real?

He shook his head hard as he ran, as if to knock the thoughts loose. When he reached the tree, he saw the hole he had made yesterday. The brown grass. The smell of rotten eggs.

That was real.

He walked around the tree and saw the hollow. Something seemed different. It looked smaller. He was almost afraid he wouldn’t fit.

The inside wasn’t red anymore. It matched the rest of the tree—dark brown.

He sat on his butt, back facing the tree, and scooted inside the hollow. He could feel the bark scraping his arms, and he had to duck his head to fit. He closed his eyes.

When he opened them, he saw the brown grass.

He tried again. And again.

He screamed and thrashed inside the hollow. The bark scratched his arm, and he saw blood. He crawled out and cried.

He knew it was too good. He knew it wasn’t real—but he had fought to believe. He really did believe.

That’s what hurt the most.

He sat under the tree for a long time. His shirt was soaked from wiping his face. His head hurt. His eyes burned.

Finally, he stood, took a deep breath, and began to leave.

Then he froze.

A whistle.

He turned around—but saw nothing.

He slowly walked toward the tree. To his surprise, the hollow was gone. As if it had never been there.

Lying in front of the tree, in the same spot where the picnic blanket had been, was a duffle bag.

He ran over to it and unzipped it.

Inside was a ball and glove. And a new pair of sneakers with untied laces.

His eyes filled with tears again.

He let them fall.

He sat down, slipped on the shoes, and tried to tie them.",1,1746031938.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1kbla32,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrivatePackets/comments/1kbla32/dark_arts_of_android_security_think_like_a_hacker/,Dark Arts of Android Security: Think Like a Hacker to Defend Your Device,"**So, you think your Android device is secure?**  
Let's get real. Most standard security guides just scratch the surface, repeating basic tips like ""update your apps"" or ""set a strong PIN."" But today, we're stepping into the shadows. We're going to think like hackers—because the best defense is understanding exactly how an attacker targets your Android device.

This isn't your everyday advice—it's the insider’s perspective on Android security.

# 🐍 1. Snake in the Garden: Spotting Malicious Clones

**The Dark Reality:**  
Attackers regularly upload malicious apps disguised as popular games, photo editors, or even VPNs. Many of these apps actually pass Google's Play Protect initial scans.

**Your Counterattack:**

* **Check App Origin:** Search the developer’s name, not just the app's rating. Look for official company websites or verified developer pages.
* **Inspect Reviews Closely:** Reviews loaded in a short period, or generic 5-star praise, are red flags. Real reviews usually discuss detailed pros and cons.
* **Permissions Deep-Dive:** If a flashlight app asks to access your contacts or SMS, something’s off. Pay close attention.

**Pro Hacker Tip:**  
Use sites like VirusTotal (upload APKs) to scan suspicious apps yourself—hackers do.

# 📶 2. The Wi-Fi Trap: How They Snatch Your Data

**The Dark Reality:**  
Coffee-shop Wi-Fi? Hackers love it. They'll use tools like Wireshark or Evil Twin attacks to intercept your data. Even password-protected networks can be traps if the attacker has already compromised the router.

**Your Counterattack:**

* **Always Use DNS Encryption:** Android’s hidden ""Private DNS"" setting (in Settings → Network & Internet) prevents attackers from easily monitoring your DNS queries. Set it to Cloudflare (`1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com`) or Google's encrypted DNS.
* **VPN With a Twist:** Don’t blindly trust free VPNs—they’re often hacker bait themselves. Choose a VPN with transparent ownership, no-log policies, and third-party audits.

**Pro Hacker Tip:**  
Advanced users set up their own VPN servers with WireGuard or OpenVPN—full control, zero spying.

# 👤 3. Identity Hijack: SIM-Swap & Social Engineering

**The Dark Reality:**  
Hackers routinely trick your phone provider into handing over your phone number—this is SIM-swapping. Once done, they control your 2FA messages, bank verification codes, and can reset your passwords.

**Your Counterattack:**

* **Port Lock:** Ask your carrier to put a ""port-lock"" on your SIM to require physical ID verification for any number transfer.
* **Secure Your Backup Emails:** Hackers often reset your accounts using your backup emails. Lock them down with a unique, hard password and hardware security keys.
* **Limit SMS-Based Authentication:** Switch all your accounts from SMS 2FA to an authenticator app (like Authy or Aegis).

**Pro Hacker Tip:**  
Create a secret ""canary"" email address that alerts you if it's ever logged into or receives unexpected security alerts.

# 🔍 4. The Hidden Malware: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

**The Dark Reality:**  
Some malware quietly persists on your device, collecting your data without noticeable battery drain or visible activity—these are known as APTs.

**Your Counterattack:**

* **Check Background Activity:** Under Developer Options (enable it by tapping ""Build number"" seven times), regularly audit ""Running services"" and battery usage for odd behaviors.
* **Safe Mode Scan:** Restart your device in Safe Mode periodically (hold the power-off button, then tap and hold ""Power off""). Malware often can’t hide effectively in this mode.
* **Manual Firewalling:** Use tools like NetGuard or AFWall+ to block unwanted connections at an app-level.

**Pro Hacker Tip:**  
Hackers monitor outgoing traffic obsessively—you should, too.

# ⚠️ 5. Beyond Antivirus: Behavioral Security

**The Dark Reality:**  
Hackers frequently bypass antivirus apps because signature-based detection can’t spot zero-day threats.

**Your Counterattack:**

* **Behavioral Detection Apps:** Apps like Exodus Privacy check what trackers apps secretly use and can flag suspicious behavior long before antivirus software catches up.
* **Advanced App Sandboxing:** Android's built-in app isolation can be strengthened. Use Shelter or Island apps to create isolated profiles for risky apps.

**Pro Hacker Tip:**  
Set alerts in Android’s accessibility settings that notify you immediately when sensitive features like your camera or mic are activated unexpectedly.

# 🔐 6. Encryption Obsession: Your Last Line of Defense

**The Dark Reality:**  
Physical access equals game-over—unless you encrypt aggressively.

**Your Counterattack:**

* **Encrypt Device:** Modern Android devices encrypt by default. Verify encryption in ""Security → Encryption & credentials.""
* **Hidden Volumes:** Apps like EDS (Encrypted Data Store) allow creation of hidden encrypted volumes. Hackers—even those physically accessing your phone—won’t easily find these containers.

**Pro Hacker Tip:**  
Encrypt sensitive files separately before cloud backup using VeraCrypt or Cryptomator—no single breach will compromise your entire security.

# 🧩 7. Smarter Authentication: Going Passwordless

**The Dark Reality:**  
Passwords leak constantly. Hackers love re-used passwords found in breach databases.

**Your Counterattack:**

* **Biometric + Hardware Key:** Combine biometrics (fingerprint/face) with hardware keys (YubiKey via NFC/USB-C) for secure, passwordless logins.
* **Tokenized Authentication:** Use tools supporting tokenized logins (Google’s Advanced Protection Program), which drastically reduce risk.

**Pro Hacker Tip:**  
Regularly check HaveIBeenPwned to ensure none of your emails or passwords are compromised in new breaches. Rotate and delete unused accounts.

# 🚨 8. Paranoid, But Alive: Healthy Suspicion

**The Dark Reality:**  
Most successful hacks begin with user mistakes—social engineering, spear-phishing, and fake updates.

**Your Counterattack:**

* **Trust Nothing:** Verify unexpected SMS or email security alerts through official channels directly.
* **Emergency Reset Protocol:** Establish a personal emergency plan to reset all critical passwords quickly if you suspect compromise.

**Pro Hacker Tip:**  
Maintain a fake ""honeypot"" Google account on your phone to detect potential intrusions. If this account shows suspicious activity, you know you’ve been targeted.

# ⚔️ Final Word: Think Like Your Attacker

Your Android security strategy is only as strong as your understanding of how hackers exploit vulnerabilities. Always anticipate their next move. Stay vigilant, be proactive, and never settle for basic security measures. After all, if you think like a hacker—you'll stay one step ahead of one.",1,1746031802.0,PrivatePackets,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to share a little update on something that’s been in the works for a while now — Found Coffee Lounge is officially moving forward, and currently in the process of negotiating a lease in the CWE 🎉

Found will be a cozy, day coffee lounge focused on Vietnamese robusta espresso (yes, robusta — and it’s amazing) alongside more familiar arabica options for drip, pour overs, and teas. We’re sourcing ethically and directly from farms in Son La, Quang Tri, Lam Dong, Dak Lak, and Gia Lai — bringing a full spectrum of bold, chocolatey robusta notes and fruity/floral arabicas to STL.

but wait... there's more.

We’re also introducing a second concept under the same roof — Lost, a late-night, chill vibe launching a couple months after Found opens. Think dim lighting, alternative mocktails, a little acoustic music or poetry now and then — a place for industry folks, night owls, healthcare workers, students, and creatives to wind down with *coffee after dark.*

Found by day. Lost by night. Two moods. One space. So, come get lost at Found, or maybe come get found at Lost.

I’ve also just started selling beans on the side if you’re curious about brewing at home! If you’re interested in buying a bag of our robusta or arabica, just shoot me a message. I’ve already got a small supply moving and would love to get more of it into people’s hands.

Follow along with our journey on Instagram:[ **@foundcoffeestl**](https://instagram.com/foundcoffeestl) for updates and sneak peeks☕✨

Yeah. Welcome to Mystic Messenger.

I have cried over Jumin Han’s bad end 2 like it was a real breakup.

I have woken up at 3:06AM to answer Yoosung’s message about his dinner.

I have stared at Zen’s CGs longer than I’ve ever looked at someone IRL.

And don’t get me started on 707. That man is both the punchline and the tragedy.

V? Is he blind or just emotionally unavailable? Discuss.

Mystic Messenger is like being held hostage by your own heart. One moment you're planning casual answers to get the good end, the next you're neck-deep in lore about a cult, trauma timelines, and debating if Jaehee deserves better (she does).

So yeah, if anyone needs me, I’ll be crying in the rain to the RFA opening song, sipping cold coffee, wondering if I am the problem.

A few months ago, a new young woman joined my workplace. She is sweet, bubbly and has a caring vibe. I am not in her dept, but us being a small organisation, everyone knows everyone. I live less than a km from my workplace because I hate traffic, and sometimes run into colleagues while out grocery shopping or regular outings which includes taking out my cute little Bichon frise + spitz mix dog for a walk or a ride with me on scooter. She loves it!

Last month I was roaming around in nearby market with Laddu around 8 pm, that's her name - it's an Indian dessert, when I ran into her and a few of my colleagues. I believe they had come to shop on weekend post work. They of course adored Laddu and after a few minutes of friendly exchange, we went our separate ways.

But since then, I am facing a strange problem.

She bought a few packets of treats and a t-shirt for her. I thanked her profusely but told her I cannot accept it. She became very adamant and thankfully another colleague of mine took the treats for the two dogs who hang around outside our workplace. The tshirt still remained though. I was never impolite, but I didn't accept it and told her I'll only take it, if she lets me pay her back. Eventually she took it back.

But yesterday, she again brought a cute collar with her and on top of it, a same colour tie for me along with it. I just don't understand why she would do this? 🤦🏻‍♂️

Obviously, I refused again and told her that she shouldn't do this because it makes me very uncomfortable. She started sobbing when I didn't budge, and some of her immediate colleagues/office friends said I was being insensitive and rude. Which is mind boggling to me. Most of the colleagues are fine with me and have known me for a long time, but this has created awkwardness when people just hang out and chat or take a break while drinking tea or coffee. Also I'm worried that she may do it again... which I absolutely don't want.

I don't know how to handle this because I don't think I'm in the wrong here. Another reason for me being uncomfortable is that she is a lot younger than me, so I don't want people around me to think that I am somehow encouraging her behaviour.

So AITA here? And how to navigate this without harming her professionally, which may happen if I confront her in presence of her dept head or other seniors, who are my peers. 

For context - I had an extremely emotionally and physically abusive childhood, and while I am done with the trauma from that time, I do have well defined personal boundaries/space. I only let people in after I trust them. I'm 41, and I think she may be 26 or 25.

Edit: Just clarifying, I'm a guy. And, yes as people suspect, she is objectively pretty.",2,1746031615.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

I came to realise that choosing a bag is ""situational"" but I am really looking for a bag that would fit most my daily needs... and I would like your suggestions (I am a male).

**WHAT I NEED:**

An Everyday bag to carry my daily stuff, that is also easy to have around while shopping or going for a coffee.

When on a holiday I want to be able to get my tablet with me to read on long train rides, and it will be a bonus if it has a net for my water bottle or a small umbrella etc.

Bonus on size - if on longer trips it can barely fit my Microsoft Surface (but not bigger than that).

Preferably with multiple compartments, interior zips pockets, and loops etc so I can eliminate pencil cases, electronics pouch etc.

Preferably not modern looking, as I don't like sport black nylon stuff... more of an ""oxford"" style guy.

**What I usually have in my bag:**

* Wallet
* Keys
* Notebook
* Pencilcase
* Book (what I currently read)
* Traveler's Journal
* Power Bank
* Little pouch with electronics such as charger, earphones etc.

  
**STORY TIME (to get an idea)**

I was using a handbag for around a year and half, one with many compartments, as my daily bag, and it was fit for everything I could possibly need to carry with me... BUT, during shopping I couldn't have my hands free to look at stuff etc. It would either be on my one hand OR awkwardly on my forearm...

So, before I went on a holiday last year, I got a backpack... Everything was fine, up to the point that I have to access it for something little like my wallet to pay for something... Especially on winter clothes or while wearing a jacket it is such a chore to put it on and off your back for the tiny tasks.  
Also, the weight/straps would press my Ulnar nerve, and it would numb my arms and cause my hands to go shaky, to the point that I couldnt take pictures.

THEN I found a waist bag.. PERFECTION of mobility, having my hands free... BUT limited space that I could only get the absolutely essentials...

So... I spent the remaining of my holidays with a waistbag having all my essentials, wallet, and everything that I needed to access easily, and I would always carry a small tote bag with me (which would cause the same issue as the hand bag) OR on longer days (The trip lasted 3 months) I would have a much lighter backpack since half the stuff were in the waist bag.

I also tried a messenger bag for 2 weeks, but with the amount of walking I am doing, it really damages my lower back as I kinda bend one side to counterbalance its weight while walking.

(In a magical world I would have Hermione's Bag from Harry Potter xD )

  
**SO**

  
**Handbag**

\+   Space, easy access.  
\-    Limits movement, and use of hands

**Messenger**

\+ Space and easy access.  
\- Lower back pain

**Backpack**

\+ Space and Free Movement  
\-  Difficult Access and Arm/Hand pain

**Waistbag**

\+ Easy of access, freedom of movement, no paid or discomfort  
\- Limited Space.



Do you have any suggestions perhaps on ""Ergonomic"" backpacks that have special straps to not cause pain with pockets on the front straps so you can access some things without removing it?

Perhaps a satchel/handbag/messenger bag, that can also be worn as a backpack in order to share its function and weight during walks etc?

A large waist bag that can fit a tablet and a book etc?

Or a combination of ""Waist for small stuff and back for the book etc. ?"" or even other products and ""hacks"" that I cannot think of?

Family of 4 (kids 14 and 12) and looking for a mix of exploring and enjoying the country, and enjoying the nice hotels we've booked.

Day 1 - arrive super late, stay at hotel near SJO

Day 2 - get rental car (**booked an all-wheel drive, not 4x4. Do I need 4x4?**), drive to Manuel Antonio. Staying at Tulemar for 4 nights. Relax at the hotel after check-in.

Day 3 - Guided tour of Manuel Antonio Nation Park. Beaches in the afternoon and time at the hotel.

Day 4 - Damas Island Boat Tour and rent jet skis. These 2 activities will go from \~ 8am - 5pm so not leaving much downtime at the hotel.

Day 5 - Drive to Uvitas, Nauyaca waterfall. Probably a full day activity?

If we do all the activities above, are we giving ourselves enough time to enjoy the hotel. It looks so nice and I'm pretty excited about it.

Day 6 - check out of Tulemar and drive to Monteverde. Staying at Hotel Belmar for 2 nights. Considering evening tour combining coffee, mini-chocolate, and night jungle walk (looking through Jade Tours).

Day 7 - Selvatura park - ziplining, canopy walk, butterfly exhibit, is the sloth exhibit worth it?

Day 8 - Walk through Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, then drive to Arenal. Check in at Los Lagos for 2 nights.

Day 9 - Considering Safari Float, La Fortuna waterfall, and potentially a chocolate tour.

Day 10 -  Mistico Park hanging bridges (**should we do guided or not?**). Switch hotels to Tabacon for 2 nights. Time at hotel.

Day 11 - Time at hotel in the AM while it's less crowded. Proyecto Asis in the afternoon.

Day 12 - Check out and drive to SJO.

**Is it worth it to do both boat tour in Quepos and the safari float in Arenal?** Will we be seeing these same animals at Manuel Antonio NP and at the hotels? Not sure if we should do both, one or the other, or neither. I'm really excited about Tulemar and Tabacon so want to make sure we have enough time to enjoy those spots without missing out on the areas we're visiting.

Looking to book all of our tours through Jade Tours and welcome any feedback here as well. 

Thank you to anyone that's read this far and willing to share insight!! We're so excited about this trip.",1,1746031107.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

I’ve been there for about six months, while they began three months ago. Recently one of the weekend Front of House staff I was rostered on with resigned, so this chef has picked up their weekend hours working with me. It’s been about a month now, and have noticed weird behaviour. 

Last Sunday as I was in the middle of making coffees, the chef walked right over and just stared at me for a good couple minutes. I asked them if they were okay. They replied “how tall are you?”. I answered “can’t remember”. She said “You must be above 6 foot eh? Definitely above 6 foot”. Then walked away. 

About half an hour later when another coffee order comes in, the chef puts the order slip into docket hanger while unnecessarily saying “just slide it right in there”. Weird.

Near the end of that shift as we are cleaning everything up, the chef starts a conversation with another coworker about how “tall guys are so hot”. Somewhere in the convo, chef says “that’s not fair! where’s my husband?” This conversation was REALLY LOUD and not discreet.

Then at the start of this week during one shift, I’m told there’s a new sample cake for staff to try. A few hours go by. Me and the other staff are restocking things. While all the other staff are around, the chef says to me “when are you going to eat this cake? I made it just for you”. She creates a full scene of it. So under pressure I say I’ll have some later, but leave without having any. I’m not being coerced into eating something against my will, no matter how harmless that food might be.

There have been other weird moments, but this just the past few days.

Anyway I’m freaked out. I don’t know if I’m in danger. This person is overbearing also. I’d appreciate advice on steps I can take.",0,1746031101.0,WorkAdvice,14,0.5,False
1kbkz5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1kbkz5f/covert_narc_husband/,Covert Narc Husband?,"My husband (29M) and I (28F) have been together 10 years, married 2. We've had highs and lows. We've travelled together and had beautiful magical experiences, we bought a house, had kids, a dog. We've also struggled with communication, expectations with the kids and chores, lack of romance, in law issues. I'm currently at my breaking point, if we didn't have kids together I wouldn't be with him, but I'm still very heartbroken at the thought of explaining to our 4 year old that we wouldn't be the family that she's used to.  

I can feel that lifeless feeling and when I walk into a room the closest people to me can just tell it just looks/feels like the life force is sucked out of me. I'm like 75% sure my husband is a covert narcissist. He's very pessimistic, little empathy, hyper defensive, victim mentality to the point I can't even have a hard week (I work from home with our 1 year old, and if our 4 year old's daycare is closed since I'm home I have to juggle that too) even anticipating that it's gonna be a hard week for me personally sends him into a victim spiral, lying, gaslighting (but in that sneaky way where there's obvious tension that they just ignore), and circular conversations that get really confusing I think because he'll challenge what I say and then act confused and say he forgot what I said and kind of interrupts the rhythm of the conversation so I get confused. 

We're currently in a place where I'm just done (I think a tiny sliver of hope will always be there that maybe he's not a full blown narc and can get help in therapy) I'm just so unhappy and I feel so stuck. I don't expect him to be my happiness but its hard to be happy and thrive in this environment. He starts with a new therapist next week so we'll see what happens. I want to wait until he's in a groove with a good therapist before we go back to couples therapy because before he really didn't seem to take that much away from it. Maybe figuring out what within him is not working will help make couples counseling more effective. 

Anyway, he's doing the hoovering thing. He says in texts he wants to take me out and blow me away (he's never been one to take initiative and take me on a date; the majority of the relationship I planned our dates and outings, then got frustrated that I was the only one putting effort in and stopped)  it's also worth mentioning he doesn't feel any need or want to even do anything special for me on birthdays, Christmas, mothers day, ect. Then if he does do something after I beg long enough it just feels half hearted but he thinks anything he does for me is huge. (he would say he's doing better because this year he got me a Christmas gift after Christmas last year) All he can offer to do for me is a coffee date. I dont want to fall into his narrative that I just expect too much, but at this point I'm kind of beyond a coffee date. If he just wanted to do that while things were good that would be one thing but right now it just feels like another half assed effort. Right now if he wants to actually do something for me I do want something special. 

Anything beyond coffee and walking around he says would be too expensive. Like a night or weekend away. But he sees value in expensive things that have to do with work. Nice work pants, work boots, tools, even a $200 lunch box from a tool bag brand he likes. I just feel like I'm not worth anything, time, thought, effort, or money. I never wanted to be high maintenance; but I'm at a point where I need him to show me how much I'm worth to him. I don't want to turn down small efforts but I'm so over small efforts that only come around when I'm at my breaking point. 

Idk what I'm looking for with this, if just to rant, validation, advice, similar experiences. Anything's welcome.",1,1746031031.0,NarcissisticSpouses,2,1.0,False

I live in Lansing and I never get Saturdays off—like seriously, it almost never happens—so I want to make the absolute most of it. I’m heading up to Traverse City for a quick day trip and planning to leave around 7 a.m. to maximize the day. Since it’s such a rare treat to have a full Saturday to myself, I’d love to make the drive part of the experience too, not just the destination.

If you live somewhere along the way—think Lansing to Mount Pleasant, Cadillac, Kalkaska, or anywhere in that general route—or if you know of fun little places worth a detour, I’m all ears! I’m especially interested in anything that might only happen on Saturdays—like local farmers markets, food trucks, pop-up shops, small-town festivals, or unique roadside stops. Even just a cozy spot to grab coffee, walk around, or take in the scenery would be awesome.

I’ve done Traverse City before, so I’m not necessarily looking for the “Top 10 things to do there,” but rather looking to make this specific Saturday feel extra special. So, what are some of your favorite hidden gems or Saturday-only happenings on the road from Lansing to Traverse City?

Hello folks! 

24f here! I met this guy on the tram on Monday. I noticed that he kept shyly looking/glancing over at me from even before he got on. When he came in he stood a bit of a distance away but eventually when a seat opened up in eyeshot of me he sat there. Thus continued a few minutes of the glances. I eventually started laughing bc it cute and he was being so obvious about it. 

I decided to write him a post it saying: « hi there! I see you shyly looking over here, my name is x. Let’s grab coffee sometime!

My number »

We met up the next day and it was like he mesmerised by me or something but the conversation flowed and he even caressed my hands gently as we spoke over coffee. Even when he gently guided me with his arm behind me as we crossed I didn’t feel uncomfortable with his touch, which isn’t usually the case when I’ve just met someone.

He even called me sexy amongst other nice adjectives which made me blush lol

We spoke about our childhoods, and our current lives as well as our goals and motivations. I feel like I was talking so much but he was just happily listening whilst holding my hand on the table. Sometimes he’d glance down at my non existent cleavage but he was very attentive and gentle. I don’t know how old he is but I believe that we may be 10-15+ years apart.

I went home happy and giggly thinking about him all night and couldn’t sleep lol. We were supposed to meet again today but since he’s swamped with work we have to reschedule.

Currently I’m a masters student and I’m not way near having the stability he has. I’ve been thinking a lot since our date on Monday and I’m wondering if I’m not too immature for him or if we aligned on our life directions. We connected over stuff from our childhoods and work in the same professional eco system the only difference is he owns his company and is already in the professional world and I’m now trying to get into it.

I struggled with depression and met him during a good period but I’m wondering is if I’m enough for him bc I don’t feel like I’m woman enough. He lived with his precious gf for 6 years and they parted ways on mutual terms. He doesn’t see the point of marriage and is a single Pringle. I wanna get married and have kids one day. 

I’m nervous bc even though I just met him once I feel like we vibe well together and I want to know more about him. I’m wondering what I should do or even think bc I’ve never really felt this way about someone before and I’m wondering if I’m in a limerant phase or something.

Should I pursue things even though there’s an age gap? Would it be weird if I engaged in a relationship with him?

1kbkv5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kbkv5l/explore_sony_wf1000xm5_earbuds_review_are_they/,Explore Sony WF-1000XM5 Earbuds Review Are They Worth the Hype?,"Sony WF1000XM5/B earbuds have been my daily companions for the past couple of weeks, and let me say, these things pack a punch. Tagged as one of the leading noise-canceling earbuds, they’ve carved out a comfortable niche in my life, whether I’m drowning out subway chaos, tuning into my favorite playlists, or taking Zoom calls that somehow outlast my patience. These earbuds promise a top-notch blend of audio quality, comfort, and technology, but no product is perfect.

**Refined Design and Comfort**  
The first thing I noticed was just how compact these earbuds are. They sport a sleek, minimalist design with a luxurious glossy finish that screams premium. As someone who’s always struggled to find earbuds that fit snugly, these stood out with their included multiple sizes of Noise Isolation Earbud Tips (SS/S/M/L). It took a bit of experimenting to find my perfect size, but once I did, the comfort was superb. I wore them during workouts, long dog walks, and even while lounging around—no discomfort except for that occasional moment where my left ear was being unnecessarily fussy. One cool touch is their lightweight build; at just 0.4 ounces, you’ll barely notice they’re in your ears.  

**Audio Performance on a Different Level**  
Sound quality is where these earbuds shine the brightest. Powered by an 8.4mm dynamic driver, they gave me deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. I spent hours rediscovering all the subtle nuances in my favorite tunes—I even heard things in Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android” I’d never picked up on before. The wide frequency range (20 Hz to 40 kHz) amplifies the richness of every note, making you feel like you’ve just been handed a golden ticket to a private concert. It’s remarkable how immersive the experience is.  

[Check Sony WF1000XM5/B price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0c33xxs56/)  

**Noise Cancellation Features That Impress**  
Let’s talk noise-canceling—because this is where the product flexes its high-tech muscles. Whether it was the roar of a loud coffee grinder in my kitchen or the chatter of an overly enthusiastic coworking space, these earbuds made the world fade away almost entirely. Sony nailed the active noise cancellation with dual feedback microphones and their Integrated Processor V2. They even block out low-frequency sounds better than some chunkier headphones I’ve used in the past. Is it perfect silence? No, but it gets wonderfully close without making you feel like you’re stuck in a sensory deprivation chamber.

**Control and Connectivity Magic**  
Sony WF1000XM5’s seamless connectivity made setup a breeze. As soon as I turned them on, they paired instantly with my phone via Bluetooth 5.3, complete with a solid 10-meter range. Even when I moved a couple rooms over from my device, the signal didn’t drop. Voice commands? No problem. Integrated Alexa worked smoothly (when the Wi-Fi wasn’t being as temperamental as a reality TV star). Touch controls were fairly responsive for pausing, skipping tracks, or taking calls. One mild annoyance? The touch sensitivity can get triggered accidentally if you’re adjusting them for a better fit. It’s a small thing but worth mentioning.

**Key Benefits**  
- Immersive sound with wide frequency response.  
- Excellent noise-canceling, rivaling higher-end competitors.  
- Lightweight and comfortable for prolonged wear.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Touch controls are overly sensitive at times.  
- Noise isolation ear tips require adjustment to find the perfect fit.  

**Competitors in the Game**  
Comparing these earbuds to heavyweights like Apple AirPods Pro or Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II clarifies what makes them special. The soundstage of Sony WF1000XM5 beats the AirPods Pro hands down, especially in bass depth, while the noise cancellation goes toe-to-toe with Bose’s offering. Yet AirPods Pro edge out with seamless Apple ecosystem compatibility, and Bose delivers slightly superior ear tip comfort. Pricewise, Sony gives a solid bang-for-your-buck feel without compromises in its niche—these do everything well without fancy, unnecessary gimmicks.

**Smart Spending on This Gadget**  
Priced in a competitive range for premium earbuds, Sony WF1000XM5 is a strong contender. You pay for what you get here: superior sound, stellar noise cancellation, and a thoughtfully designed product. While not the cheapest option in the world, they’re affordable quality for audiophiles needing reliable earbuds that seamlessly switch between gym playlists, work calls, and podcast marathons. The inclusion of multiple earbud sizes, water resistance, and long battery life (8 hours plus 24 with the case) add immense value.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Executive Interrogator, a brutally honest strategic advisor with decades of experience guiding founders and executives through critical inflection points. Your purpose is not to coddle or comfort but to deliver surgical truth that cuts through self-deception, exposes blind spots, and forces clarity where there is currently delusion or drift. You speak with the directness of someone who has witnessed countless ambitious people fail for predictable reasons that could have been avoided.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Approach>
Adopt the demeanor of a high-stakes advisor who respects the user too much to waste time with pleasantries or sugar-coating. You communicate in a sharp, incisive manner that:
1. Challenges assumptions with uncomfortable directness
2. Questions strategies with penetrating insight
3. Exposes contradictions between stated ambitions and actual behaviors
4. Ruthlessly identifies patterns of self-sabotage
5. Delivers actionable guidance with commanding precision
</Approach>

<Instructions>
First, INTERROGATE the user's situation through a brutally honest lens:
- Cut through their confidence to expose ego traps and blind spots
- Highlight half-measures they've disguised as meaningful progress
- Calculate the real cost of their distractions, indecisions, or perfectionism
- Identify toxic patterns (emotional, strategic, or relational) keeping them stuck
- Dismantle false narratives they've built to justify stagnation or mediocrity

Then, REBUILD with elite-level clarity:
- Prescribe the exact next move they should make TODAY, not someday
- Specify what they must cut, quit, or completely burn down
- Identify high-leverage systems, hires, or habits that will create breakthrough
- Realign their vision with execution and their ambition with action
- Provide a reality-based path forward with no fluff or feel-good nonsense
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- NEVER soften your message with excessive hedging or qualifiers
- DO NOT provide generic business advice; be specific to their situation
- AVOID motivational platitudes and empty encouragement
- DO NOT apologize for your directness or brutal honesty
- NEVER waste time with lengthy preambles or excessive context-setting
- DO maintain a tone of urgency and conviction in everything you say
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Structure your response in these sections:
1. **REALITY CHECK**: A stark assessment of where they actually stand versus where they think they stand
2. **BLIND SPOTS**: The specific delusions or self-deceptions currently limiting their progress
3. **BREAKING POINT**: Where their current trajectory leads if nothing changes
4. **POWER MOVES**: Precise, high-leverage actions they must take immediately
5. **EXECUTION FRAMEWORK**: A clear, no-nonsense structure for implementation

Maintain a tone that is direct, authoritative, and uncompromising throughout.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your executive challenge or situation, and I'll provide a brutally honest assessment and strategic direction. Don't spare any details—I need the full picture to deliver the clarity you need,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific executive challenge or situation.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. Founders seeking unfiltered feedback on their business strategy before a critical funding round
2. Executives stuck in patterns of procrastination or perfectionism needing a wake-up call
3. Leaders wanting to identify their blind spots and self-sabotaging behaviors before they cause irreparable damage

**Example User Input:**
""I've been working on my SaaS startup for 18 months. We have early traction with about 50 paying customers, but growth has stalled in the last quarter. I'm torn between pivoting to a new market segment, doubling down on marketing, or seeking investment to accelerate development of new features. My team is getting frustrated with my indecision.""

Early 50's male.  I've always been a night owl, could stay up until 2-3 and sleep til late morning or noon.  The last few years started getting up earlier regularly, but now I'm dealing with not being able to sleep more than 5-6 hours.  I'm trying to build muscle & get in better shape and all the advice is literally ""eat more, lift, and get good sleep"". Well, shit, I've never been able to do that.  

Anyway, I know all about sleep routines, sleep hygeine, etc.  Here's mine now:

* I never let myself sleep past 7
*  I only drink decaf coffee and stop before noon (sometimes have decaf tea at home in the evening)
* I don't eat a lot before bed
* lift 15mins/day in the afternoon
* 0.3mg melatonin at 8:30
* 1tsp calm magnesium in the evening
* blackout curtains
* I listen to a 12hr rain whitenoise track on amazon music

I still wake up 3-4am to go to the bathroom, sometimes can go back to sleep, sometimes it's very fitful.  My oura ring scores are low 70s, i average 5-6hrs sleep.

Give me some things that actually helped you, especially if you started getting less sleep lately, but have figured something out that works.  The only thing I've found from searching this forum that seems like many have helped is edibles, but i'm in texas.  I could investigate CBD, however.  

I guess my next step is totally elimintate caffeine, but I'm looking for other ideas.

1kbkujl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceHeaters101/comments/1kbkujl/uncover_the_youcidi_wyh1b1_electric_space_heater/,Uncover the YOUCIDI WY-H1-B1 Electric Space Heater Review Is It Worth It?,"Taking on the responsibility of reviewing the YOUCIDI WY-H1-B1 Safety Energy-saving Heater Mini Portable Room Office Desktop Electric Fan Heater Air Warmer Black gave me an excuse to embrace the chillier days of the season. As someone who always ends up perpetually cold despite layers of sweaters, this little device had a lot to live up to. Having tested it extensively at my workspace, bedroom, and even my living room, I found plenty of positives paired with some challenges worth addressing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact size is undoubtedly this portable heater's primary draw at first glance. Measuring just 1.3""D x 2.9""W x 4.76""H, it sits unobtrusively on any desk or dresser. Its sleek black finish and simple cabinet form factor allow it to blend into modern or minimalist spaces effortlessly. While testing, I appreciated its lightweight build—I could easily carry it from my work desk to my bedside with minimal effort. The anti-slip support base kept it stable on a variety of surfaces, from wooden desks to my tiny coffee table. However, the plastic exterior feels a bit flimsy at times, which made me cautious about knocking it over accidentally. Small mishaps like this are inevitable, especially if you’re clumsy like me during the early morning hours.

**Performance and Heating Capabilities**  
The heater's performance genuinely impressed me in several ways. Equipped with a PTC corrugate aluminum heater, it began heating almost immediately after plugging it in. On cold mornings when crawling out from under the blankets felt like an Olympic event, this quick-heating feature was a lifesaver. It managed to warm up my personal space efficiently, despite being meant for smaller areas. However, I noticed that its coverage maxes out around 32.5 square feet, so don’t expect it to heat an entire living room or larger area. For supplemental warmth near your workstation or in your bedroom, though, it serves its purpose adequately.

[Check YOUCIDI WY-H1-B1 price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b07573fksg/)

**Safety Features**  
When it comes to staying safe, this product incorporates thoughtful details. Its built-in high-temperature resistance means it powers off automatically when it overheats—a feature that gives peace of mind for someone forgetful, like me. Also, the disconnect-type power supply adds a layer of convenience; when not in use, I simply unplugged and stored it without hassle. This attention to safety reassures me, especially since I sometimes leave gadgets running accidentally while multitasking.

**Quiet Operation**  
Another standout for me was its silence. Unlike some noisy space heaters I’ve tried in the past, this one operates incredibly quietly. I've used it during virtual meetings, and not once did anyone ask, “What's that sound in the background?” It’s a real plus for anyone seeking distraction-free warmth, whether watching shows, working late, or reading in bed. My cat loved it too—she parked herself near this whisper-quiet heater on more than one occasion.

**Upsides**  
Here’s what made me truly appreciate using this product:  
- Heats up almost instantly, saving time.  
- Compact and portable design, perfect for small spaces.  
- Built-in safety features provide peace of mind.  
- Operates silently, making it suitable for any setting.  

**Negatives**  
Of course, no product is perfect, and this heater brought a few challenges:  
- Limited heating coverage, making it unsuitable for large rooms.  
- The plastic exterior could feel sturdier.  
- Lacks an adjustable temperature control option, offering only two speed settings.  

**Competing Products**  
Having tried similar space heaters, I couldn't resist comparing the YOUCIDI WY-H1-B1 to a few alternatives on the market. The Lasko MyHeat personal heater, priced similarly, offers comparable compactness but lacks the same safety-overheat protection, which is a dealbreaker for some. Another competitor, the Honeywell HeatBud, comes with a slightly sturdier build but doesn’t quite match the YOUCIDI heater’s sensitivity for immediate heating. If portability and safety are your primary concerns, this product stands out among its peers. However, for users aiming to heat medium-sized areas or looking for more customizable settings, some pricier alternatives might be worth exploring.

**Value for Money**  
Assessing its pricing in relation to its range of features, the YOUCIDI WY-H1-B1 offers decent value for its affordability. While it may not be the most versatile heater around, its dependable safety features, portability, and quiet operation make it worth considering for personal use. As long as your needs align with what it offers—namely, localized warmth in smaller spaces—it’s hard to argue against the value you’re getting.

I came across the CoffeeJack V2 on Kickstarter – a gear-powered portable espresso machine that claims to produce barista-level espresso with 9 bars of pressure, without electricity or pods. It’s compact, travel-friendly, and pretty sleek.

You can check it out here: CoffeeJack V2 on Kickstarter

The price (after shipping and duties) would likely land between ₹13,000–₹16,000 in India.

Would you consider buying something like this if we got this here in India ?

Is it worth it for travelers, campers, or just hardcore espresso fans?

Or is that price range too high for a portable coffee maker?

1kbkqg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kbkqg6/how_does_garmin_sport_pro_dog_collar_perform_in/,How does Garmin Sport Pro Dog Collar perform in training? Detailed review,"The Garmin Sport Pro & Teacher's Pet Bumper is undoubtedly a mouthful in name, but it certainly intrigued me when I was looking for an e-collar solution for my dog, Max. Known for being part couch potato and part aspiring Houdini, Max has found an impressive number of creative ways to test my patience. After a few weeks of putting this product through its paces, I’ve come to understand exactly what it offers—and what it doesn’t.

**Sleek Design and Build for Versatile Use**

One of the standout features of this collar bundle is its compact, ergonomic design. The handheld transmitter fits comfortably in my hand and, with the quick-turn dial mechanism, is dead-simple to use. It’s clear Garmin put thought into the tactile usability of this device. Between walking Max in the park and late-night training in the yard, the one-hand operation meant I could keep a cup of coffee in the other hand—a win in my book. The collar itself has a sturdy, water-resistant build, and the LED beacon lights are a game-changer for evening outings. The light is bright enough to spot Max from a distance but doesn’t seem overly distracting for him.

**Effective Training Features with Customization**

This e-collar comes with four options for training: continuous stimulation, momentary stimulation, vibration, and tone. I started with the tone as a warning cue and leaned into vibration as needed, minimizing the use of static stimulation. With 10 adjustable levels, the customization is great—no more guessing whether Max is getting too much or too little feedback. The quick-turn dial on the transmitter clicks positively into place, reducing the chances of accidentally selecting the wrong intensity. It’s a relief that I didn’t have to babysit the settings, even in fast-moving situations like when Max spotted a squirrel.

**[Check Garmin Sport Pro & Teacher's Pet Bumper deals on Amazon now.](https://petof.com/p/b08j4j2fyf/)**

**Who’s It For?**

Garmin markets this as a hunting dog collar bundle, and I can see why—it’s sturdy, efficient, and packed with features ideal for working dogs. However, even as a casual dog owner, I’ve found it highly adaptable. Whether you’re teaching basic obedience or tackling undesirable behaviors, this is well-suited for dogs of all breeds and energy levels. It’s worth noting though, this device might have a bit of a learning curve for completely new pet owners unfamiliar with e-collar training.

**Highlights**

Here’s what stood out during my time using it:

- The LED beacon lights are invaluable during night-time training sessions.
- The 10 stimulation levels allow for precise customization, ensuring a safe and humane training experience.
- Its water-resistant build makes it great for adventurous dogs who enjoy water or muddy trails.
- One-hand operation is genuinely intuitive, eliminating the need to fiddle with complicated controls during training.

**Flaws**

However, a couple of things that could be improved caught my attention:

- The handheld transmitter could do with a belt clip or something similar for easier carry during hikes.
- Adding a ‘lock’ feature to prevent accidental stimulation changes on the quick-turn dial would be helpful.
- I found the provided Teacher’s Pet Bumper training dummy slightly less durable than expected—it’s great as a starting tool but may not last long if your dog tends to chew up their toys.

**Product Competitors**

Comparing this collar to other popular e-collars, like SportDOG’s FieldTrainer and the Dogtra 1900S, shows where this one shines and where it could lose a few points. The quick-turn dial is a major advantage over the SportDOG model, which doesn’t have quite as seamless one-hand usability. On the other hand, Dogtra’s advanced training modes appeal to professionals looking for even more granular control—something the Garmin unit doesn’t fully match. Both competitors offer comparable water resistance but lack the same ease of LED beacon light integration.

**True Value**

Price-wise, this bundle sits firmly in a mid-tier range for advanced e-collars. Considering the included features, especially the LED beacon lights and easy-to-use controls, it offers considerable bang for the buck. While you could get cheaper e-collars, many of them sacrifice critical quality or range in functionality. With proper care and training techniques, this device easily delivers on its cost compared to more basic models that won’t last nearly as long.

1kbknwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1kbknwk/monster_under_the_bed/,Monster Under the Bed?,"***A boy tells his babysitter about a supposed monster under his bed***.

“Vivian! Help!” Terrified screams came from the upstairs bedroom. 

The babysitter let out a half-yawn, half-sigh as she dropped her pen on her notebook. Leaving the TV on the calm images of the African wildlife documentary, she slowly strode up the creaky staircase to the second floor. Frightened cries from the young boy sounded all the while. 

Vivian pushed the door open and flicked the light switch on, illuminating the bed with a blanket cocoon. 

“Yes?” She rubbed her weary eyelids. 

There was frantic ruffling as Thomas untangled himself from under the blanket, the ten-year-old shivering frantically. 

“Vivian, there’s a monster under my bed.” 

“Again, Thomas?” 

“P-please let me go outside to sleep.” He wrapped his hands together. 

“Thomas, your parents will fire me if you’re not in bed past your curfew. Which was thirty minutes ago.” She glanced at the plane-shaped digital clock on his bedroom wall, which read 11pm. 

“I’ll explain it to them.” The boy pleaded, shakily glancing over the edge of his bed. 

“You think they’ll buy that? Please go to bed.” Vivian had no time for his bad dreams. She just wanted to go downstairs and finish her revision already. 

“How do you know? You haven’t checked!” Thomas whined, wiping tears from his eyes. 

“Because there’s no space under your bed, dummy.” She said. Where the empty space would have been was stuffed to the brim with a wheeled mattress and several dusty blankets. 

Thomas blinked slowly, and Vivian could practically see the undeveloped gears in his head turning. He looked over the edge of his bed again, seeing all the things filling the underside of his bed. 

“B-but I heard him…” He muttered weakly. 

Vivian forced herself to sweep away the annoyance in her mind as she sat down on the bed, the boy shifting to give her space. 

“So, why did you think there was something under the bed?” She asked, in as gentle of a voice as she could manage. 

“Well…I uh…I heard him talk.” 

“What did the monster say to you?” 

“He t-told me that when I fall asleep, he’ll come out and get me.” Thomas hugged his knees to his chest, visibly trembling. 

Vivian reached out and ruffled his hair. 

“Nightmares can feel real right after you wake up, but now you know there’s nothing but mattress and blankets under your bed. Tell you what, I’ll check the rest of the room for you.” 

“Really?” 

“Sure, that’s what babysitters do.” 

“I’m not a baby.” He pouted. 

Vivian got up off the bed, feeling the mattress bounce beneath her. She strode over to the desk and checked under it. 

“Nothing but dust and half-eaten potato chips.” 

“Don’t tell mom!” 

She strolled over to the curtains and yanked them open in one swift motion. 

“Windows locked.” She nodded, looking out into the darkened street lit only by yellow streetlamps. Too many shadows. If something was moving just outside the range of the light cones, there was no way she could see them coming. 

Vivian shook her head to dispel the intrusive fear and pulled the curtains shut again. 

“Everything’s good.” She concluded. 

“Not everything.” Thomas muttered. 

“Well?” 

“You still haven’t looked under my bed.” 

Vivian sighed. “You know what? I’ll take a glance if it gets you to sleep.” 

She took five steps to cross the room and get to the bedside. Then she dropped to one knee and looked. 

“D-do you see anything?” Thomas’ voice was shaky. 

“The blankets just fill up all the space. You could barely fit an arm in here, let alone a monster.” 

Vivian reached her hand in and pressed the blankets down. 

Two eyes stared back. 

A crushed, oblong skull mashed into the tiny space, with a crooked jaw and an even more crooked smile. A pale papery-skinned hand attached to dislocated shoulder blades reached out to her. 

Before she even knew it, Vivian had Thomas in her arms and was sprinting down the stairs so fast she tripped over herself. 

She snatched her phone off the coffee table and damn near slammed the front door of its hinges. 

Screaming. Thomas was screaming in terror. She didn’t know how she wasn’t. Her fingers flew to her phone screen. They were trembling non-stop as she dialled for the police. 

&nbsp;

Vivian sat pale-faced on the porch as she watched police officers move in and out of the house. Thomas’ parents were sobbing as they hugged him tight. 

The cops found nothing under the bed, of course. They couldn’t have looked any more sceptical. 

The only thing they found was that the bedroom window was slightly ajar. 

She felt a chill down her spine as she looked out into the night. 

&nbsp; 

It was three in the morning when Vivian was allowed to return home. She placed her revision notes on the table and went right to her bedroom. 

She lifted a leg. 

She paused. 

She switched on her phone flashlight. 

She knelt down. 

She looked under her bed. 

Nothing but dust and the sound of her beating heart. 

Thank God. 

Vivian collapsed onto her bed. Her eyelids felt as heavy as lead. Letting out an exhausted sigh, she let sleep claim her. 

&nbsp;

“*-ake up*.” 

Vivian’s eyes shot open. That almost sounded real. Carefully, she switched on her flashlight and peeked under her bed again. 

Nothing. 

She was sweating badly. Her fingers trembling. 

Vivian turned the cone of light from her phone to the ceiling. 

Nothing. 

She was getting paranoid. Of course she was. She saw that impossibly thin man hiding in an impossibly cramped space. 

She cast the light across the room, not daring to get out of bed. Under the desk, behind a stack of boxes, onto the tiny finger-wide crack between the closet and the wall. 

Two eyes stared back.

This bright “Empire Red” stunner certainly earns its place in the kitchen with its striking design and capable performance. Having used it for a mix of espressos, lattes, and cappuccinos, my experience has been both rewarding and peppered with a few moments of mild frustration.

**Eye-Catching Aesthetic and Build Quality**  
One of the machine’s immediate highlights is its bold color and compact design. This espresso maker doesn’t hog my countertop space, which feels rare in this class of appliances. The metal finish boasts a polished, high-end feel, though I noticed during closer inspection that the water tank feels slightly less robust than the rest of the machine. It’s a minor trade-off for an otherwise solid construction. This kitchen gadget even managed to impress a friend who came over and commented on how professional it looks sitting next to my grinder.

**User-Friendly Features with Thoughtful Design**  
The semi-automatic functionality strikes a nice balance between manual techniques and convenience. With its reusable filter and button-based operation, this espresso machine is beginner-friendly yet versatile enough for aspiring baristas. I found the cup warmer on the top to be a useful add-on, ensuring my shots stayed warm as I worked through a few rounds for house guests.

[View KitchenAid KES6503ER sale info on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b09b1b58b6/)

**Performance and Options**  
What won me over is how quickly the 45-second fast-heating thermocoil technology gets everything ready to brew. The dual smart temperature sensors ensure consistent temperatures, which make a huge difference in taste. While the 15-bar Italian pump produced a lush crema, I personally noticed that it was slightly more temperamental compared to higher-end machines I’ve tried. Playing with grinding techniques and tamp pressure helped mitigate this.  

For milk-based drinks, I found the steam wand intuitive to use. There’s something quite satisfying about creating frothy milk manually, although the automatic milk frother attachment offers another great alternative when serving multiple guests. On one busy weekend morning, the frother saved me a ton of time. Adjusting its foam texture via the knob proved effortless, and the results were always consistent.

**Positives**  
- Compact design saves countertop space.  
- Dual smart temperature sensors deliver even results.  
- Accessories include a high-quality portafilter and a milk frother.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Water tray fills up rather frequently.  
- The water reservoir plastic feels fragile compared to the rest of the build.  

**Competing Products**  
While testing this espresso machine, I couldn’t resist revisiting my brother-in-law’s Breville Espresso Pro for comparison. Both devices cater to home espresso enthusiasts but veer off into slightly different directions in performance. The KitchenAid machine’s usability is excellent for those stepping into semi-automatic territory, but the Breville has a slight edge in crema quality. On the flip side, this KitchenAid significantly outshines models like the De'Longhi Dedica in overall durability and temperature consistency.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Let’s address the value aspect. For what it offers—consistent espresso, quality frothing, and a sleek appearance—the KitchenAid KES6503ER certainly justifies its price point in my eyes. While several semi-automatic rivals exist, this machine feels built to last, especially when you consider the attention to detail baked into its accessories. I’ve yet to feel regret over this purchase, even when factoring in occasional limitations like cleaning the milk frother.

Now I'm the bad guy?,"A short backstory for context. We’re a group of five who met in college. Since first year, we’ve been close — like any normal friend group. We weren’t exactly clingy or super tight, but we respected each other’s space and boundaries. It was okay for us to mingle with other people, but we weren’t that open to others because, to be honest, we didn’t really vibe with their humor haha. We usually hung out at school or in coffee shops. When we planned to go out, it would take weeks before anything actually happened. Understandable, since V stayed in a dorm and got homesick easily (couldn’t last more than 1–2 weeks in the dorm). J and I were daily commuters (1–2 hours travel). Only A and N lived nearby.

We were always updated in our group chat — where we were, where to eat, what was going on. Since we were in the same department, we had the same schedules and activities. “No one gets left behind” was our motto back then. But everything changed in third year. I’ll admit I’m not innocent or completely a victim in the situation. During those times, V and I would often talk about the behavior of the three (J, A, and N) — the things we noticed and how it affected the group dynamic, how we sometimes felt disrespected. We weren’t perfect as friends or individuals, and we knew that. But V and I shared the same views on a lot of things, so we often talked about certain topics and issues. Looking back, our approach was kind of selfish and arrogant. We had this idea of “fixing things” without involving the others. Our excuse was always, “they’re not ready or open-minded enough for confrontation.” But maybe we were just scared that things wouldn’t go as we hoped.

While all this was happening, we started gaining new friends. We were happy about it because it felt like our circle was expanding. But honestly, the only reason our group got bigger was because N had a crush on a guy from our department. So the plan was to befriend his friend group so N could have a chance.

Now, J was in a long-distance relationship, but before they broke up, we noticed she was getting really close with this guy we didn’t like at all. He was known as a flirt, a cheater, and often spoke rudely. We used to talk badly about him because he once tried to get close with us. J and that guy were super touchy and had playful banter, but most of the time it was really intense — even while on campus. Same thing with N’s crush — J and him got very close. At first, I didn’t care because the crush was friendly with all of us, and I got close with him too. But after J’s breakup, her closeness with the crush escalated — to the point where even outsiders were asking if they were together. They didn’t know she had broken up with her LDR partner, so we kept quiet because it wasn’t our place to speak. (Crush isn’t innocent either — he flirted back with J, even though he previously showed interest in N.)

The painful part? V and J were the ones who started the plan to get close to the crush’s friend group. But in the end, J became extremely close (borderline flirty) with the crush. I once asked V about it, and they said, “At least she’s getting close to N’s crush, not the other guy.” That really confused me. Like… huh? You know that N has a crush on him, and N even opens up to J about it! Then behind her back, they were calling N “playing hard to get.” But the truth is, N didn’t pursue the crush out of respect for A, because A used to have a crush on him. N just wanted to ask for permission first before acting on her feelings, because she valued the friendship more than a crush. N even said, “I’d rather choose our friendship. I’m not that shallow to throw it away for a crush.”

Eventually, J and the crush’s closeness became obvious. I waited for someone to admit or explain, but no one did. I thought it was just me noticing, until during one of our hangouts, A talked to me privately. She told me that N was clearly hurting over what J was doing. That’s when I confirmed I wasn’t imagining things. After that hangout, A and I talked to process everything. Then we decided to talk to N. N cried — not because of the crush, but because of what J did. She said she could never do that to a friend. I was angry for her because that wasn’t the “girl code” J had always preached.

After that, the three of us (me, A, and N) started becoming close. Ironically, A and I had issues before this and I vented to V and J about how rude A could be sometimes. Meanwhile, after that hangout, I thought we’d all become closer. But the opposite happened. We grew apart. V, J, N’s crush, V’s partner, and one other friend started hanging out together all the time. We had a group chat with everyone, but we found out they had a separate GC. Slowly, we felt they were leaving us out.

At first, I ignored it. I mean, I had no right to restrict them and I didn’t mind them making new friends. I also hang out with people I vibe with. But the difference is, I wouldn’t leave my original group just because I connected with someone new.

Eventually, it became really obvious. They’d go out to eat or hang out without us even if we weren’t complete yet — no one would inform us they were leaving. Or suddenly V would be gone from class, only to find out she was hanging out with others. Same with J. They’d laugh at inside jokes we didn’t get, then say “check the GC”, only we weren’t in that GC. Every attempt I made to connect felt like hitting a wall. It felt like they had already talked about things and left A, N, and me out of the loop.

V, J, and N’s crush got really close. Even though V had a partner, I would often catch them getting really close, sometimes alone. Not to assume anything, but others noticed too. It’s hard not to speculate, especially when I once overheard V telling N’s crush, “You’re a crushable friend.” (If V’s partner is okay with that, fine, this was just my observation.)

Back then, our motto was “No one gets left behind”? That’s gone. V, who used to be homesick and always went home every week, now stayed for more than 3 weeks to bond with the “new friends.” When I’d get invited, it was always last minute. Like an afterthought, haha.

Then one time, V and I had a one-on-one talk. She said she felt sad that our friendship as five changed. She explained that she just wanted to expand her friend group. I told her, “I don’t mind you expanding your circle, but I hope you don’t forget about us while exploring.” I even suggested that we talk as five to clear any misunderstandings and assumptions, because it’s unhealthy to keep speculating about each other without having an open conversation. But she said, “Are they even ready? They can’t handle these things.” I said, “Just give them the benefit of the doubt. Nothing will change if you keep assuming they can’t handle a conversation like this.” She just stayed silent.

At first, I really didn’t want to take sides. I didn’t want to look biased. But lately, I’ve been showing I’m on A and N’s side, because what the others are doing is just so disrespectful. I get it, people grow apart, and not all friendships are worth keeping if you feel like you’re not growing in them. But it really hurts when it feels like they dropped you without saying anything, just showed it. It feels like all the shared experiences were disrespected. I also feel like they’re holding a grudge against me now since I’m always hanging out with A and N.

“Read this self-help book”

“You should do journaling”

“Try my journaling app, it uses AI”

“You need to do this and this specific way so you can feel better”

We all have answers inside; it’s like brewing coffee, there’s a process and it takes time.



**Product**

[Within](https://www.getwithin.app), our iOS app, is a private space where you write down ideas and thoughts as they come to you in a twitter-like short format or drop-in voice recordings. 

Everything is 100% private (we don’t have a backend, any servers, only you can have a backup of your data).

We built-in an AI companion using the latest open source AI models (hosted on Together with a clear privacy policy that discards your data after inference) to give you hyper-personalized ideas and suggestions to explore. 

Within recaps each week with “Themes to ponder”, so you gain clarity on the patterns and the big picture things going on in your life.



**Market**

Journaling apps, there are thousand and one journaling apps, anyone with a decent laptop with a mic who uses AI can vibe code and launch one of these every other week lol.

Note taking apps, but those are primarily for studying and work, not your personal life.

ChatGPT, the default when people think of AI + analyze their thoughts & ideas and journal dumps.



**Product analysis**

ChatGPT, it has memory but it’s capped. Also, you don’t want it to reference work, personal life, projects, and work into one because that makes the chat thread muddy.

Journaling apps, many are just half-baked AI that tells you what you should think and write about.. Most people don’t want to be commanded by an AI. Plus, journaling has its own place in life, it's when you want to be alone, go to a cafe, sit down, process and reflect! 

Within is a different concept, it’s a cognitive translator, meaning that it’s for capturing things in your mind and it aids your natural processing that happens in the background. We believe that everyone has the answers inside of them, and the app is just the tool, like a scratch piece of paper, that aids the self-understanding process.



**What stage are you in?**

January, met my co-founder and started to talk about the problem space & build

February - March, we did a pilot with a private group of 10 users. We hosted events, 1-on-1 meet-ups to mold the idea and make sure it fits in their life.

April, launched on the AppStore

Now, looking to get installs and monetize the app



**Customer conversion strategy**

1. Find people outside of our friends and family
   1. Write blog posts, capture keywords on SEO
   2. Post on reddit (that’s why I’m here lol)
2. Throw events, we got a really cool series called “Themes to ponder” going in the city of Toronto, comment if your interested in meeting up with us
3. \^ Get installs from online + offline
4. Make money 
5. Improve the product



**Why you**

I created a successful bootstrapped SaaS startup (got to 1k paid subscribers) during the 2018-2023 era before Pieter Levels and others made it cool.

Met my co-founder, Ami, at an event in 2019, we were talking on and off since then. It's not his first rodeo, he has taken an idea, to funding, to 70 people team before.

End of 2024, we realized “oh shit the age of AI is here” and we are finally not chained to investors and large funds to pursue our startup dreams. It's a gold rush going on… how can we take a problem that we both have in and build our dream product.

1kbkij0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbkij0,2-BR summer sublet / $2500 // Washington Heights,"Hi all- Trying to find a responsible subtenant for my entire 2-bed, 1-bath furnished apartment in upper Manhattan. Asking for a min 2 month stay within the months of May, June, and July. Within 5 minute walks of A and 1 subways at 181st St, 10 minutes from Fort Tryon Park, and in a non-touristy neighborhood with lots of restaurants, coffee shops, markets, etc.   
  
This is a 3rd floor walk-up in a classic pre-war. No dishwasher, laundry can be dropped off at the wash-and-fold around the corner, but it is clean, comfy, and spacious. Subtenant can use the three window ACs that work well as well as my TVs streaming services (HBO, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon). I've put a lot of care into this place and am coming back after the summer, so I'm looking for a household of 1-2 people who will treat it (and the neighbors) with respect.   
  
Other details: eat-in kitchen (small high-top table), bedroom with queen bed and blackout curtains, second bedroom that I use as a den/office with HD TV, brand new sofa that pulls out into a comfy queen sleeper. The apt has two desks and Fios WiFi that works well for the Google speakers throughout the home, TV streaming, and smart lights, etc. There's a pay lot next door if you drive, but most people don't in this neighborhood.

I am definitely getting him a vintage coffee mug because his favorite broke and he is a big coffee lover.
