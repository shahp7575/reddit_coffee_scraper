I consulted with a lawyer who mentioned that the business must be ready or nearly ready to operate at the time of application and I cannot be the sole worker performing all duties in the business. For example, if I open a coffee shop, at the time of applying, I must have everything set up so that the business can operate shortly after my arrival in the U.S and I cannot say that I will handle everything myself in the first year and expand by hiring employees in the second year. The lawyer point of view seems different comparing to my understanding.

My idea is to have most things set up and ready before the application, I will do technical work for the business during first year (except for a part-time administrative assistant to for administrative duties). Would this be a critical issue that could lead to a denial of my application? How many employees is recommended?",1,1736078857.0,e2visa,0,1.0,False

I am in my first relationship and really curious.  We are planning to staycation this February, he said he'd pay for it and then we will split the cost next time. Should I be turned off? 


Context: 
We are both working, but I would like a man with a provider mindset to be with in the long run. I just think that this should show in these early stages of dating/ relationship. 

He willingly pays for our dates, of course, I treat him dessert, coffee sometimes when we still have 
time. I like treating him as well he is really kind to me. 

I think my confusion comes from my upbringing with my parents telling me that a man should always pay for everything.

1hu5pg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1hu5pg1/new_routine_with_sd/,New routine with SD,"After a little bit of advice, potentially from blended families who have been through this.
Our SD (12) has been withdrawn from us (SM, BD, half sibling 2) for a few months now, will come every other weekend and stay in her room on her phone (that’s another story!) we’ve tried lots of tactics, going out for days, movie nights, coffee dates, family games, 1:1 time, shopping days etc but she has her head in her phone like she really doesn’t want to be around us. We always check in with her to tell her she can air any feeling she may have but every time she says she’s ok. She is also going through puberty so we have tried to be sensitive to those feelings too. She goes home and tells BM we don’t give her much attention which isn’t the case and has been asking to not come.
We have good communication with BM and BD is chatting with her this week to dig a abit deeper about how our SD is feeling, and potentially decide a new routine going forward to benefit everyone, we don’t want our SD unhappy here - we need her to think of our home as a positive place for her not a negative and it’s not fair on us to be on edge when she’s here as we don’t want to do anything wrong.

Does anyone have any recommendations to a new routine? Maybe one that works for you? We have always said that we will have an open door policy that she can come whenever she likes but was thinking maybe every other Sunday having lunch and during half terms she stays? We really don’t want to force anything but we love her so much we just want to be apart of her life as little as it may be. 
We’re not silly we knew this day would come the older she gets but it doesn’t make it any easier as we love our family or 4.

Here’s my tentative plan: I’ll try to sleep as usual the night before, then in the afternoon (around 4 PM), I’m considering smoking to help me relax and take a nap. Ideally, I’d sleep until about 7 PM, wake up, have dinner, grab some coffee, and head into the interview.

1hu5ndt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hu5ndt/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_spend_my_birthday_with/,AITAH for not wanting to spend my birthday with my boyfriend?,"My boyfriend (28M) and I (25F) have been dating for almost 3 years and have spent 2 of our birthdays with each other. Our birthdays are 1 week apart with his coming first. For context, my boyfriend is a musician and belongs to a very wealthy family and works for the family business whereas I come from a middle class family, live on my own and manage all of my expenses myself.
For his 27th birthday, I rented a music studio for him and his closest friends who are all musicians because my boyfriend’s best friend was moving to another country and I knew he wanted to spend as much time with him as possible. Arranged food for everyone and a cake too. Got him a super expensive wallet as a gift which he had been wanting to buy since a few years.
My birthday was a week later. He got me a beautiful bouquet at midnight. We went out for dinner and coffee during the day and he said that we can split the bill because that’s what I prefer (I usually insist on this but on my birthday I didn’t bring it up as I really would like to be treated). The gift that he got me was a jewelry box and was much smaller in monetary value than what I had gotten. He felt bad about that and got me something else later on to make up for it but I didn’t like that because it just felt like compensation. What really hurt me was that he didn’t even get a cake for me and I ended up getting a cake for myself at the coffee shop by the end of the night.

For his 28th birthday, I took him to his favorite restaurant and an art studio for a painting date because he used to sketch and paint. All expenses paid for. Got a cake delivered to him at midnight and even got one to cut at the art studio. Got a bunch of gifts as well.
A week later on my birthday he sent me cupcakes at midnight. In the day we went to one of my favorite restaurants but at the end of the meal, he mentioned splitting again but recalled that its my birthday so he’ll pay for the meal and I can pay for the coffee. That again put me off. When we got to the car I was in a bad mood already. He kept insisting that we should go to his favorite coffee shop because he really needed the caffeine. I said sure but that I won’t be having any coffee there because I didn’t feel like having any. He responded very aggressively and dropped my hand. This resulted in a huge fight. I told him how upset I felt that there was no planning, I keep being asked to pay and that I’m not even being asked about what I want to do. He felt upset about how no matter how much he tries, he can’t get this right.
I ended up going home by myself and cried the whole day.

This year I have not planned anything for his birthday and have told him that we can do whatever he wants to do because he made it clear to me that he does not enjoy doing too much on his birthday. I have gotten him a very nice gift which I’m sure he’ll love.
On the other hand, I love doing something on my birthday but this year I don’t want to spend my birthday with him because I find that my expectations are too high and I just always end up feeling disappointed. I know I’ll be hurting him when I tell him that I don’t want to spend my birthday with him but I don’t want my heart to get broken again. I know I’ll be miserable either way but the hurt of being along seems bearable compared to the one I have been feeling on my past 2 birthdays.",2,1736078473.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

In ""The Coffee Bean,"" Jon Gordon and Damon West share a modern fable about resilience, adaptability, and positive transformation. Follow Abe, an average American, as he learns a life-changing lesson from his science teacher, Mr. Jackson, which reshapes his worldview.

**The Fable's Core Lessons:**

1. **The Carrot and the Egg:** When life heats up, don't become like a carrot, soft and defeated, or an egg, hard and closed off. These symbolize our potential to either be weakened by adversity or hardened against it.

2. **The Coffee Bean:** Instead, embrace the mindset of a coffee bean. Transform your environment positively, just as coffee beans turn boiling water into a delightful brew. This metaphor teaches us to influence our surroundings through our inner strength and resilience.

Join us as we explore how embracing the coffee bean mentality can help us navigate life's challenges, turning adversity into opportunity. This episode is perfect for anyone facing obstacles or seeking to make a positive impact in their world.

1hu5lso,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hu5lso/my_boyfriend_hates_most_of_my_habits/,My boyfriend hates most of my habits ,"A few weeks ago I moved with my boyfriend. We are getting married in February. Turns out he dislikes a lot of the things I do.

I like to make almost everything around the house. But he hates how I do it. For example I always makes coffee sweet and with different flavours and he hates it. He just wants to drink black coffee. The food I make he says it’s good but I’m starving him. Just for the record I always makes him double of what I make for myself. So if I’m eating 50 grams of rice I’ll make him double. He says that he loves my culinary skills but I underestimate how much someone like him needs to eat. 

Before going to sleep I use an Arabic perfume all over the bed and he hates that as well. Also he’s helping me workout and I like to wake up early to go for a run. And he hates that as well. He usually goes on the afternoons to run. 

He didn’t want to recognise any of this and I really had to insist for him to tell me. He says he doesn’t mind waking up early for me to work out. He knows it’s important for me and I won’t be able to keep up doing it alone. 

But there are other things that I do that he does find annoying and unnecessary. And I should keep them just to myself. 

Technically it’s not a big deal, but I don’t know. It’s still surprising. I have a lot of small habits that he dislikes. Some of them he doesn’t care about. Some others he says are annoying. Like spraying perfume in the bed, he says it gives him a headache. It’s mostly things like that. And what I eat, which I guess is more important. Because he thinks it’s not enough.",1,1736078314.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False
1hu5lpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1hu5lpw/i_love_being_confused/,I love being confused ,"


I love being confused and its just such a wonderful feeling when you don’t know something properly. Confusion stretches and massages the brain and squeezes all of the depression and anxiety from out of the brain. When I get confused it is an amazing moment and I get a rush of euphoria and joy that no other person could compete with. 

Oh I love confusing people even more and I hate those who lead a life that makes sense or try to make sense out of confusing things. These people are the destroyers of joy and they should be crushed and destroyed with not one atom left of them. I remember a couple of months back I saw my ceiling moving up and down inside the house and I was astounded once more at how this was happening and why I wasn’t crushed. It was incredible and how my ceiling was moving up and down and not changing the whole house was brain teasing. I could feel a good stretch in my brain and a good needed stretch was needed. I then saw a train coming out of my cupboard and the people inside the train were puking on each other. They were puking different colours on each other.
I had no idea what to make of all of this and I was so happy with what I was experiencing and how I couldn’t explain it. I loved this so much and I loved confusion more than my children who starved to death because I over fed them. I don’t know how they could have starved with the amount of food I had given them but then again, I was becoming high at the senselessness of it all. I love confusion more than my wife who I married on the moon without any space suit and I remember the wedding and how impossible it was, all of it. Although there we both were getting married on the actual moon and even my time table for work is confusing where it says my day off is at the same time as my working day, and that’s why I love my job.

My life is perfect because nothing makes sense and I don’t want anything to make sense in my life and I want things to happen without cause or effect. I once shot my gun at my friends head and all of a sudden he didn’t smell of body odour anymore. My friend had always struggled with the way he smelled and people in public would always move seats in public transports, but ever since I shot him in the head he smells amazing now. I love this and my brain is having a party and a wild ride and I don’t want it to stop like ever. I remember getting a taxi and the taxi never moved from its place and when I got out of the taxi, I was now at my destination. I then started to argue with the taxi that because he never actually moved his car I didn’t really owe him money. The taxi driver then started arguing with me at how logical I was being and he was right. I paid him extra and I started to burn my tongue with lava as punishment for making sense and instead of pain, I instead became a great singer for a while.

Then there is Arnold who is always doing things that make sense and I hate Arnold. The worst thing about Arnold is that he brings his logical straight forward world into other peoples lives and it also straightens out their lives for a bit. Everything starts to make sense and logical and the terror of everything making sense is just too torturous for me. I have warned Arnold of ever coming close to me and infecting my life with his life. Arnold tries to speak to me about things that make sense and I try to ignore but as my ears and mind absorb what Arnold is trying to say, everything in my life starts to straighten out. Heating things makes things hotter and cooling things makes things colder. I then punch Arnold and instead of falling he gets transported to a library. Then everything in my life becomes confusing again and I have a sigh of relief about it. Everyday I count the blessings that is confusion and I count them and I praise the confusion that gives me so much joy and laughter. People like Arnold makes things hardened and rough with their logic and sense where everything must go in a certain way and I don’t like that at all. I prefer it when I try to turn left on a road that it becomes right and when I crash into a car, I end up in Barbados. This is the way the world should always be.

As I see Arnold desperately trying to speak with he people inside the library about logic and sense I count the blessing of confusion. I cut down trees by placing a pillow on the tree and I drown by not going into the water. I breath in air by not breathing in air and I run by not running and by realising these things it gives my brain such a great massage. Honestly the brain needs a great massage and I could feel of the juicy tensions dripping away from my brain and it feels oh so marvellous. I burned my daughter with ice cream even though I never had a daughter but every day I hug my daughter even though I never got married, even though I got married on the moon. It’s the guy Arnold again trying to interrupt my counting of blessing that is confusion and as he comes closer to me, his aura starts to effect the world that I love and know. Everything starts to make sense and time seems to flow more correctly and what’s up is up and what’s down is down. Its just so horrible when things make sense and I don’t know who would want to live in a world like this.

I push Arnold and I run away from him by not running away and to fight against Arnolds is by doing something confusing that doesn’t make sense. I count more blessings of all of the confusion that I experience in my day to day life. I shopped around and paid money with it even though I never have money and I am penniless, the world got destroyed today but I am still here and I got a birthday present for someone who will never be born. Yes I felt more better now and especially when that Arnold guy ruins my life for a moment. Who does that Arnold think he is going up to people and straightening out their lives and making their brains feel more stiffer and rigid. Today I also met my worst enemy and I also didn’t meet him and realising that caused an opening in my brain and flooded with so much good feelings and I was in heaven. I said hello to people who weren’t there and I flooded a country with no water. My remote wasn’t working because the batteries had ran out of charge and so I got it working by not replacing it with batteries that do work. I walked on ground that were made of air and I pulled teeth out of people who had no teeth.


I love counting my blessing of confusion and I gave bald people haircuts and freed dogs by getting them more leeches. I knocked on a house by never knocking and I solved a problem even though there was no problem to start off with and I couldn’t stop counting all of the confusing blessings in my life. I was hopping with joy and licking other peoples ice creams and holding hands with people with no hands. Then Arnold was close by and his gathering was growing bigger and I couldn’t believe that his following was increasing. I couldn’t believe that people were listening to Arnold about logic and things making sense and I knew that he will infect those people by making their lives move in a straight line. Arnold you are a destroyer of good things and an asshole to begin with and the things that I want do to you Arnold for ruining peoples lives with idea of logic and things making sense is an abomination. Its not just an abomination but an travesty and you should be hanged Arnold for giving such idea of sense and logic. Nothing should make sense and nothing should ever go with the flow and life should be confusing because a confusing life is just amazing.

I cook food without cooking and eat without eating and I cannot imagine what your life is like Arnold and I couldn’t even be in the same room as you. Saying that I don’t want to be in the same room as you, I made that possible Arnold by being in the same room as you and I knew this confused you when kept on asking me why I was in your house, and when I kept on answering back with “the reason I am in your house is because I don’t want to be in the same place as you or in the same room as you” and this confusion caused you so much mental agony and I was enjoying it. Then I gave you more mental agony by saying how much I hate by loving you and this caused you more confusion but then you started attacking back at me by trying to make sense of things. Arnold when you tried to attack me back by trying to make sense of things I could feel everything going the way it should do in order and in physical sense. I hated it and my brain started to hurt from the depression and sadness and I tried attacking you back with more confusion. 

I started to count my confusions.
I made a cake for myself but a stranger had eaten instead and I shower by not showering, I watch tv with my eyes close, I listen to music by being deaf and I run by not using my legs. I could tell now Arnold was hurt by these things and he begged me to stop but I kept on going and going. I go on the computer by picking up a rock and I saved someone by not saving them and I gave a correct answer to a question by giving the wrong answer. I was winning against my fight against Arnold and I knew the confusion that surrounded me was now affecting Arnold life and then Arnold started to fight back. He started saying out correct math equations and things that made sense in a sentence and this started to hurt me. How dare you Arnold try to fight me back and I had never experience someone ever fighting back by having someone fight me back. I ran out of Arnolds by standing still and I could feel my life making sense. Things moved that had the correct engine and motion and the air was properly breathed in and when I held someone down in water, they had surely drowned. 

Luckily though I was away from Arnold long enough for the confusion to come back into my life. The police arrested me for drowning someone by not arresting me and I got given a life sentence by simply living life as a free man. Arnold was now growing in number and these lived lives that had made sense and were properly aligned. It was disgusting and I couldn’t believe that people would do such a thing and how dare they turn away from confusion. So I didn’t punish them by punishing them and we still had growing numbers of people like me who were still relishing in the wonderful enlightenment of confusion. I love being confused and I loved confusion more than I love my enemy and myself, and I am the enemy. I love saying things that don’t make sense and when my brain tingles when it is confused, what other substance can do such a thing for the brain without any real consequences. I had to count more confused blessings and I drink coffee by drinking orang juice, and I divorced again even though I was never married to begin with and I always move forwards by going backwards.

I don’t understand why people want their lives to make sense and such a logical life will become boring and depressing. I remember when my life made sense and everything felt so empty and I wanted to disappear. The existential crisis you will get from a logical life is unanimous and the constant same motions will go backwards and forwards till you go crazy and faithless. What sort of life is a logical one where the heart hardens and you feel nothing and the brain loses its imagination and wonder. 

Arnold should be decapitated, Arnold should be burned, Arnold should be made an example out of for those who stary against confusion. Arnold thinks he is doing good but he doing the opposite and fights are breaking between people of confusion and people of logic. Those who are of confusion like me keep doing confusing things by not doing confusing things to be confusing and to hurt the people of logic. The people of logic do logical things by picking up litter and putting it into a bin or setting the alarm clock to set off at a certain time so that you could get to a certain place in time. What a horrendous way to live and I will never yield and I will never bend down to the people of logic.

I will always be confused and I will always be doing what ever like by not doing it and sometimes when the confusion gets to a certain amount, the good feeling endorphins start pushing out some of the brain from out of the nose. I got a piece of my brain that came out of my nose but it wasn’t my brain but someone else’s. So someone else’s brain came out of my nose and I then decided to go to America by simply not going on a plane or a boat. Then I remember being surrounded by some of Arnolds and their auras and the things they were saying, it was making sense and my brain was hurting like a lot. I tried to count my confusions and I loved how I went home by not going home, I loved how I cooked hot food inside the fridge and I enjoyed fishing with my best friends that are also fishes. 

My best friends that are fishes would become offended when I catch a fish and don’t let it go and I love it how I got to sleep by not sleeping and waking up by not waking up and I enjoy how I pick my nose but always think its my finger but its actually someone else’s finger, and so I chop it off and give it to them and apologise to them for having their finger on my hand. Arnolds friends were surrounding me and the things they were shouting at me sounded like “something fell to earth and cocked up everything. Everything has gone haywire and you have to got to try and stay logical to beat the confusion. There is something in the air” and it was making sense and so I started killing them by not killing them and burying them in the skies. They were destroying everything that I love and I couldn’t believe that they would do such a thing and destroy a person’s wellbeing. I love being confused and its like when a person grinds their sharp nails against your eyes that’s how great confusion feels. Oh the freedom that confusion gives compared to logic because logic imprisons things to be a certain way. Like that thing should be like that and this thing should go like this, but now confusion has made it where anything is possible.

Arnold was crying at some of his followers that weren’t alive anymore and he looked at me with anger and I looked at him with anger by showing him kindness. I took him to restaurants and shopping and that’s how much I hated him. The confusion sometimes nearly took over him and now and then I though that I had Arnold in my grips and that he will be part of the confusion soon and just learn to love it. Its so good and I love counting my confusions like turning on the lights without turning anything on and nor having any electricity. I like how I show my kindness by angrily shouting verbal abuse at people and I love visiting doctors because I have nothing wrong with me and I demand they cure because I have nothing. Arnold gone now and he is kneeling down and its like he can’t take it anymore.

That’s it Arnold be my brother and be among the confused, be among the naked by wearing clothes, be among the senseless and illogical, be among the confusion. I go up to Arnold by not going up to him and he looks at me with the look that he is enjoying the confusion now and even some of his followers try to help him but it useless now, the confusion has set in and he will enjoy it, he will relish it and his mind will bend by not bending and all of the negative juices of the brain will leak out and he will be better. Are you confused yet by what I have told you. Don’t worry it will come to you and you will be in love.  ",1,1736078305.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

sana mas mag iinsist siya na pumila at umorder. sana hindi niyo na kailangan mag bato bato pik kung sino magtatanong sa guard.
sana mahilig siyang magtake ng pictures nang hindi nahihiyang magselfie.
sana basahan ka niya ng mga tula ng pag-ibig.
sana gawan ka rin niya ng tulang ikaw ang paksa. sana hindi takot sa kanya si hayley (ur cat) sana mas mapilit ka niya na mag kwento ng mga pinagdadaanan mo. sana hindi niya hayaan na makatulog ka nang may mabigat puso. sana mas mahal ka niya.

and for u sushi, i really hope life is treating u well. i would be happy if ure truly happy now.
not hearing from u brought me peace pero kahit green light na, ikaw pa din talaga.
ikaw pa din ang iniisip ko. mukha mo pa rin ang hinahanap ko sa maraming tao. nababali pa rin yung leeg ko pag nakakaamoy ako ng creamsilk triple keratin rescue ultimate straight. wala kang kapareho ng boses. tandang tanda ko pa rin kung paano mo sabihing mahal mo ako. nasa akin pa rin yung notebook na binigay mo, kalahati na yung gamit na mga pahina, hindi ko na kasi kayang sumulat ng tulang pag-ibig ang paksa.

as for me, tinigil ko na ang pagbabasa ng mga old messages natin. hindi ko na kailangan ng mag papaalala sa akin kung gaano tayo naging masaya at kung gaano mo ko minahal. dinelete ko na rin ang mga pictures mo tho may mangilan-ngilang lumilitaw.
wag kang mag-alala nakakainom na ako ng kape. hindi na ako nasusuka. bumalik na yung pagkahilig ko sa kape. na-eenjoy ko na ulit siya. sana ikaw rin :>

and you’re living in my town now— have been for a few yrs…. And I see your jeep every once in a while and I just wish I could talk to you for once without you massively hating me.

Second rule is rather simple I value my time and I respect that other people value there own time just as highly if we get to a second date or meet up you get ten minutes if I am picking someone up and let's say dinner is booked for 7 at a restaurant I tell her that I will pick her up at 6:30 if she is cool with that I get there a few minutes before the agreed time and she does not even look like she is ready to go she gets until 6:40 since the agreed time was 6:30 if she is not ready to go or not even close to ready I just leave and go grab dinner on my own if you are going to pull that kind of stuff early in a relationship I do not want to stick around and find out exactly what you will try to pull later on it is just a mutual respect thing your time in the world is important to you and my time is important to me so both need to be considerate so one needs to be considerate of a potential partner from the beginning to even have a chance at a successful relationship

Rule three we are adults I am well aware you did not pull an Athena and burst forth from your father's head that morning we all have a past I am divorced my ex is a good person for five year it was a wonderful relationship and then over about six months it just wasn't anymore we ended things as adults and we're civil with one another we just grew apart she wanted to move to Canada and try to get into acting to follow a dream that had only formed over the last year or so and I was not willing give up everything both uproot my life and financially subsidize that given I was not even licensed to work in engineering in a different god damn country you will not have to listen to me witch about past relationships but I expect that same courtesy your past is your past your ex is your ex I do not want to hear about them unless it is in the context of them running for public office or something and you decide to tell or share a funny or weird story about them shitting their pants while public speaking and you being surprised that they would pursue that kind of career path given everything you know about them as a person if that ex helped you figure out have you like something in bed or something great tell me about the thing they helped you figure out not the ex in anyway

Rule four we all use our phones for work school for banking and just basically every aspect of life in it's entirety I will never ask to look through a phone with your permission as in you ask me to look for something I return I expect the same level respect when it comes to my privacy and my personal property as in my phone and any other piece of technology

I’ve been here for a couple of months already and it's been quite lonely. I work full-time on weekdays and maybe quite busy by then. But I reply fast to texts so that wouldn't be a problem.

I have lots of time to spare on weekends and maybe we can go out and have fun - visiting random places, having good meals, and chatting over coffee or some drinks.

If there's one thing l'm pretty much excited about, it must be cooking for you at my flat. Then we get to watch movies together and enjoy our time with each other.

I love taking pictures. Once we get to know each other well, I'll show you my IG full of wonderful photos from the places I've visited. Hopefully, when we're together, my albums will also be filled by wonderful photos of our adventures around the world (Europe first, then somewhere else — been to some already and I hope to add more memories, with “you” 😉).

I prefer someone also from here in London. So I can be with you regularly and we can spend quality time. I'm not sure if I can do long distance again since I have trust issues coming from the past. But let's see if it'll work.

I'm just a simple guy, not very hard to please. If you've reached this part and you're game with everything, maybe you can send me a message and let's see where it goes?

If there’s one thing I’m proud of, I’m a very caring lad who likes to give my partner quality time. 

Read: Just in case you're wondering, I prefer a TOP, MASC guy, and preferably NON-ASIAN anymore (just a breath of fresh air from dating all sorts of people from the continent). Hope you get to respect that as I’m quite sure you have your own preference. 😁

Oh and if you’ve reached this far, I have a little secret that might interest you even more… 😅

","Jake parked and walked into the low diner with its comforting lights brightening up the dead dark night.

He was famished, not having eaten for hours, and even though he knew he didn’t have much longer to drive and he was desperate to see his dying mother, he had to get a bite. He told himself it was better to eat now, than show up at the hospice hungry and unable to pay attention to what was happening.

He almost stumbled into the diner. Inside was as comforting as the lights promised it to be, and although it was well after midnight, there was a few patrons dotted around the plastic red tables, their hands curled around war steaming mugs, their faces dipped towards plates of comfort food. He couldn’t smell anything, and he somehow noticed that, and the silence. No clinking of cutlery, no coffee and bacon aroma.

Well he’d been driving along the dark highway for hours, focused on getting to his mother while trying to keep his looming grief at bay. No wonder his senses were out of joint.

There was nothing out of joint in the hot plate of food the smiling server pushed over to him. He couldn’t remember what he ordered, in his heightened emotional state, just that it was plentiful, warm, cheesy, gravy, meaty. He shovelled it into his mouth, feeling the energy and goodness radiating along his tired limbs. He was grateful to the server for not chatting to him, understanding his wordless need for distance. He sipped the coffee, and it was perfect, not too hot, not too cold. He didn’t burn his mouth, and he gratefully took a huge gulp. The dark liquid flowed through his veins, lifting the veil of fatigue, and he looked around, taking slightly more interest in his surroundings. The server was pretty.

But he couldn’t dally. He would never forgive himself if he arrived too late. The hospice staff had been kind, but clear.

He pushed his credit card to the pretty server. She smiled even more broadly, and said something- he couldn’t hear, or understand. “On the house”? But why?

He didn’t have time to discuss. If they didn’t want his money, fine. He pocketed his wallet, nodded, and headed out. His sense of urgency heightened, he almost missed the door, narrowly avoiding walking into the wall.

Heavy darkness still blanketed the stretch of highway. He looked back at the diner, its twinkling lights still advertising “DINER” “OPEN”– the only lights visible. The windows were dark.

What?

He didn’t have time to wonder- he had to get to his mother, and with his belly full of warm lovely food, there were no more excuses to dally.

But he needed gas. Luckily there was a gas station just on the other side of the highway. Carefully, he drove in, and as he got out, the first rays of dawn pierced the darkness.

Pumping gas, he glanced over his shoulder. In the grey light, he couldn’t see the diner lights at all. No building.

The other side of the highway was just emptyness.

Jake cried out despite himself. An elderly man pumping next to him looked up.

“Son?”

Jake closed his mouth. Then opened it again. “There was a diner there” he muttered, and with his free hand pointed across the highway to the patch of grey nothing.

The man said grimly “Son, you can’t be from around here if you don’t know what happened there. That old diner closed after all that hullabaloo died down, and got torn down few years back. Nobody was eating there no more”

Jake stood quite still. He could still feel the warmth of the food in his body, the aftertaste of coffee in his mouth. He looked at the old man, who was minding his business pumping gas.

He needed to get back on the road. He had to get to his mother. He couldn’t stop and argue.

Quickly, he swiped his credit card and paid for the gas, jumped into his car, and tore off.",2,1736077403.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Around July last year i was in a cafe with my family as my father came to visit. Out of no where after some chips and a sip of coffee i started feeling really sick. Had really bad nausea to the point where i could have thrown up. i ran to the toilet to take a breather as im truly afraid of being sick. luckily i didn't throw up. Obviously after that i was thinking maybe i ate something bad or have a stomach bug.

A week passes, still had this nausea feeling off and on out of no where. i started getting concerned. i tried reflux medications, i cut down foods that are fatty as well as cut down milk even though im a soy milk girly. Anyway i spoke with a GP she did a bunch of blood tests that would show concerns with my symptoms. Back to symptoms its not only really bad nausea at the top of my stomach its also alot of tiredness, weakness, soft stool mainly in the mornings.

Once blood tests came back everything was clear and perfect which is surprising. my doctor was confused so she gave me medication that helps get rid of ulcers in the stomach but also helps slightly with reflux. i was on that for 2 weeks and im still on them. Mind you its been 7 months or more with me going through this with no answers, ive changed diet as well as taking vitamins. i feel my sickness is getting worse and more frequent definently after eating. Ill be finally going back to my GP to talk deeper about my issues and ask about scans to see the underlining issue. please has someone gone through this or knows someone who has.",1,1736077303.0,AskMedical,0,1.0,False

I’ve been slowly getting into coffee for the last year and a half: I first started with a moka pot, then I started enjoying espresso and more artisan coffees (I frequent artisan cafes far too much). I bought this small espresso machine last year second hand and very cheap as I am a student with a small budget, and I was given this portable grinder for my birthday. 
This machine makes an acceptable coffee but it never pulls an espresso properly (which feels like a disservice to my very expensive beans) and the milk wand is barely better than a handheld whisk. I’m a barista at a cafe as well now so I can really feel how shabby my machine is. 

I’m thinking of upgrading to a proper machine and grinder this year, Im willing to save up quite a decent amount as this is my biggest interest at the minute. Any recommendations for a good quality machine which isn’t painfully expensive would be much appreciated (for an idea of price I wouldn’t want to spend more than £2k on the whole setup but if I need to I could save up).

1hu5aq8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hu5aq8,[Acne] Struggling with Persistent Acne After Accutane – Need Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been battling acne since puberty. Like most people, I was told it would go away with time, but it only got worse. A few years ago, I decided to take it seriously and visited several dermatologists. Unfortunately, none of the treatments worked.

Finally, I went to a cosmetologist who prescribed me Accutane for 4 months. It worked well—my skin wasn’t completely clear, but it was a lot better. I would only get occasional breakouts, especially around my period.

Fast forward to last year (March), I moved to Europe for studies. For the first few months, my skin was great, but then I started noticing back acne. It gradually spread to my chest. By June, I began seeing clustered acne on both sides of my cheeks, and it has only gotten worse since.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

Completely cut out dairy.
Limited sugar intake (this has been hard since I love coffee and sweets).
Researched and upgraded my skincare routine.
Changed pillowcases frequently and avoided touching my face with unwashed hands.

Despite all this, nothing seems to be working. I recently switched to public insurance and have booked a dermatology appointment, but I wanted to share my concerns here to see if anyone has experienced something similar or has advice.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

1hu58ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hu58ap/th_miss_veer_or_miss_eden_chapter_1/,"[TH] Miss Veer (or, Miss Eden), Chapter 1","Eleven-year-old Veda watched mutely as her father suffered. Sweat lashed down his face like the rain on the lounge window. His brow screwed in a manner that struck his daughter as one of concentration, but she quickly came to notice it was, in fact, one of pain.

Mr. Edom Veer was now clutching his chest, the green wool of the jumper creasing from the pincer motion of his brown fingers. He stood up unsteadily, then lowered to his knees in a half-controlled fashion, perhaps trying not to disturb young Veda. When retching and violent trembling began to occur, however, the girl knew something had to be done, and it was up to her to do it.

Ambulance. Call the ambulance. Please, if you will, call the ambulance. Veda legged it to the landline, a sleek, black thing on the TV stand. She picked it up and dialled the famous triple-nine. The dreaded sound of vibration ensued, and then a lady’s voice asked Veda which emergency service she was trying to reach. Veda said nothing. She and her father locked eyes. A vice gripped the child’s throat. The woman on the phone repeated her question, firmly and clearly.

Veda was never very good at speaking. Her very pronounced stutter had plagued her for some years. ‘Stutter’ is not actually the right word for it, as she did not repeat syllables incessantly. Her problem was closer to a sort of intermittent, seemingly random muteness, and *this* was what made her sometimes repeat parts of words. When the sudden silence hit her the worst, it felt to her like a powerful ache in her back, chest and throat, a physical sensation of compression. She didn’t know why this came upon her, she wasn’t hugely bothered by the opinions of others, but her largely independent spirit was nonetheless constrained by an invisible and apparently unkillable inhibition. This was what she was experiencing on the phone to the woman from emergency services.

Young Miss Veer tried to speak. She inhaled deeply, and with a sort of deep, throaty groan that made her cringe, she said the letter ‘A’, then ‘aaambulance. Please.’

‘I’ll put you through now, dear,’ the voice said. Then a man informed the girl that she was through to the ambulance service, and asked her how he could help. Veda tried to clear her mind. Edom released an intense gurgle that, in a strange, ironical, semiconscious way reminded the child of herself. This horrid sound pushed her into action.

‘My Dad is in pain. Clutching his chest. Groaning. Please help.’

‘Okay, love, where is this happening?’

Veda said nothing, but wanted to say something.

‘Is this taking place at home?’

‘Y. Y. Yes.’

‘Where do you live?’

‘Uhhh Ffforty-four Green Aaavenue.’ She particularly struggled with vowels.

‘Okay, thank you, please stay on the line until the ambulance arrives, it won’t be long.’

Veda did stay on the line. In only a few minutes blue lights materialised and flooded the lounge of number 44. Unfortunately, by this point, Mr. Veer had stopped moving. Tears started to trickle down Veda’s cheeks, but she quickly decided against letting them fully gush. The sheer blueness of the light, and the mournful wail that accompanied it, somehow struck the girl as unnatural and unsafe. This combination of sensory input represented danger, the loss of life, whenever one sees or hears an ambulance speeding by, it never brings comfort. Drivers know this best of all. Still, this particular ambulance was the only hope Veda Veer had, so she went up to the front door and opened it to allow the ambulance people, and the night, in.

Two people in green uniform guided Veda into the open back of the ambulance. Her father was swiftly brought in ahead of her, on a gurney.

As the hulking vehicle stalked rapidly down Waterside’s wet streets, Veda held her father’s hand. He was still conscious, but barely. The staff asked him to remove his jumper and mauve suit shirt, which he needed help with. After this, they applied patches connected to cables on his hairy chest, and also to his arms and legs. When the process was over, they nodded gravely and knowingly, though not without a sort of professional detachment.

A blonde paramedic informed Veda in a gentle tone that her father had just received an electrocardiogram, which confirmed for the crew that what he was experiencing was, indeed, a heart attack. Knowing this allowed them to give him the appropriate care as fast as possible. Veda, always a little sceptic, did not feel in any way comforted by this obvious (adults really were stupid) attempt at consolation and distraction. The man’s principle mistake, Veda felt like telling him, was using a different tone of voice when addressing her than when conversing with fellow grownups. This would not be the last time the girl’s childish reality would begin to become transparent.

Later that night, Edom Veer died. Now Veda had neither father nor mother. If she had hurried up with the phone call to the emergency services, so she inwardly reasoned, they might’ve been able to get there in time. Another, even more worrying thought emerged violently in her consciousness: where would she, an orphan, be taken to live?

Through a process that was not very well explained to her, Veda’s question was, technically, answered. She was sent to live in a residential care home before some generous person came along to foster and, who knows, maybe even adopt her! The girl didn’t feel too enthusiastic about that.

The place she was taken to looked like an exceptionally large house, with pale outer walls and a protruding arch that cast a shadow over the front mat. Accustomed to small, English terraces, this building looked to the child like a veritable mansion, minus the aura of class, sophistication and comfort. Quite on the contrary, it bore a vague quality of poverty about it, it was merely a blown up, fun house mirror reflection of the rundown ground floor flats she had known before her father finally got that job as a professor of English literature at Waterside’s university. It was this huge boost to his income, and confidence, that allowed him to wear mauve smart shirts even when relaxing at home. When he, the knowledgeable widower, took his only daughter to 44 Green Avenue, she felt a minute pang of guilt (oh, but none of my friends get to live somewhere *this* nice) that quickly gave way to excitement (you mean to tell me we get to live *here*?). Now the privacy and good central heating of this living arrangement, and the existence of her beloved father, were replaced with cold, communal living with other broken souls who did not automatically like each other.

At the black front door, Veda had her new situation explained to her by Eileen, her key worker who would be, compared to the general body of staff, particularly responsible for her welfare. This pseudo-parent had a funny habit of never smiling, nor, apparently, washing her dark hair, which was always kept in one of those buns that seemed to betray early morning haste and misery. ‘I’ll take you inside and show you the whole place,’ Eileen said to Veda in her flat, Dublin accent.

The child was shown the lounge first. It was a spacious but colourless room, with a trio of cracked, brown sofas all facing in on a big coffee table. Children of various ages sat or stood in this general area, silently. Some looked at the newcomer, some didn’t.

Veda was shown the kitchen, fire exit, staff’s offices and back garden before being taken to her bedroom, right on time for bed at nine pm. The room was small and the narrow bed had a dip in the middle.

The girl was sent to sleep. Lights out. In total darkness, Veda wanted to cry, but found that what she was experiencing was a step beyond ‘typical’ sadness that makes the eyes sting. This was more of a sense of emptiness than regular sorrow, it was the perfect absence of what should’ve been. The feeling might’ve been compared to hunger, the desperate longing for that which makes a human life complete and colourful. To make matters worse, the girl simply could not sleep. Even if her father, the only guardian left in the world that actually loved her as an individual, had not died on her, Veda had been an insomniac from birth. Her brain felt somehow *dry* to her, it was not producing the sweet, warm stuff of sleep that it should’ve. She was an old soul, so adults often told her as she grew. Her brain was a dusty thing that should’ve been put to rest long ago, but here Veda was, alive and questioning why that should be at only eleven-years-old, trying to cry and failing in a cold, foreign bedroom, languishing in the pure black.

1hu52mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1hu52mq/we_deserve_something_better_than_langchain/,We deserve something better than LangChain,"Over the past few years, I spent a lot of time building apps using LLMs while I was in grad school. Throughout the development journey, I found one common problem in the current AI app development ecosystem. 

**The existing frameworks, such as LangChain, have too much abstraction.**

Why is this a problem? There are a couple of reasons.

1.  **Black Boxing:** it makes your backend black-boxed and difficult to see through what is going on in your pipeline.
2. **Too Generic**: their tools are too generic to use when you want to build a specific feature but it's not easy to understand the source code and customize it.
3. **Learning Curve**: they define whole new syntaxes that make us have to learn how to use them.Frameworks should exist to reduce the difficulty of repetitive tasks. But when we have to spend so much time learning how to use the framework to simplify some basic processes, it's a waste of time.

**What is the cause of this problem?**  
The root of this problem is very simple. Their architecture design is ""framework-centric"" and tries to hide database-like operations as much as possible. This makes the framework highly abstracted.

**Suggested Solution**  
The solution to this problem is making a new abstraction architecture that is ""database-centric,"" which means that you can use it as if you're using a database rather than a framework. I call this database ""CapybaraDB"" and you can see [the docs here](https://docs.capybaradb.co)

  
**Example of the new architecture (CapybaraDB)**  
Imagine you have a diary app and want to save your user's data in a way you can retrieve it later for a RAG pipeline. With existing frameworks, you need to carefully design your schema and pipeline so that it fits the framework syntax. But in my new database, you can save your data just like you are using MongoDB. The only difference between CapybaraDB and MongoDB is that you have to wrap the text that you wish to embed with the ""EmbText"" class. That's all you have to do! Everything, including chunking text, embedding, and indexing, will be handled by the CapybaraDB server side. 

        { # 'content' field will be the subject of semantic search later.
            ""title"": ""Diary Entry: A Quiet Morning"",
            ""content"": EmbText(
                ""March 5, 2024 - Woke up early today. The sunrise painted the sky in soft hues of orange and pink. I brewed a cup of coffee and sat by the window. It's these quiet moments that remind me how peaceful mornings can be before the world starts rushing around.""
            ),
            ""type"": ""diary"",
            ""status"": ""Personal""
        },

**EmbText**  
Any text data you wrap with ""EmbText"" will be chunked, embedded, and indexed automatically and asynchronously. You can use it in nested fields too.  
Ex. EmbText(""a text you want to embed"")

**CapybaraDB data processing on the server side**  
Detect all EmbText data in the saved documents  
↓  
chunk into smaller strings  
↓  
embed  
↓  
save documents and vectors  
↓  
ready for semantic search at any time

**Minimum but necessary abstractions are provided**  
CapybaraDB doesn't provide too much abstraction, as you can see. It only provides the minimum & necessary abstraction so that you can add your custom pipeline as you like on top of it. You can use it as if you are using MongoDB with an extra embedding feature for AI apps, which the original MongoDB doesn't offer.

This project was originally an internal tool. But I thought I could help someone else and decided to productize it.

Last year (March) i saw a senior level, fully qualified job advertised at £80k and i cannot say why but i applied for it - i didn’t think id get it. Surprisingly i got it. I was gobsmacked and couldn’t believe my luck. This is a legitimate fairly well known company in the public sector and I’ve been paid on time each month.

Since starting I’ve been pressured by my manager to bend accounting rules and fudge the books repeatedly. Examples of things I’ve been asked to do: understate the spend on a project that is clearly over budget; classify revenue expenditure as capital expenditure; lie to auditors about the nature of spend; admit to a mistake i didn’t make with the promise of additional time off etc etc. 

Each time I’ve refused and sometimes escalated to my managers manager who acted shocked & promised me he’d look into this. Each time my manager has said no problem and he’ll figure something out - he has been pretty pleasant about it and there were no hard feelings. Maybe i am naive but i also thought this meant he dealt with these issues properly and above board.

 The last time i refused resulted in my manager getting real snappy with me and we had a verbal falling out. My manager has then since been “off” with me and it’s been a really hostile work environment - he has basically taken all work off me so i have very little to do each day (this sounds great but it’s really not as I’m a hard worker by nature and don’t do well without steady work). In a 7 hr day im doing about 30 mins work on a good day; sometimes not even that. He has suddenly started micro managing me asking for evidence of when i logged on, asking why im AFK if i go to make a coffee, sitting in on my meetings etc. He is constantly trying to catch me out - eg in a team meeting my internet connection dropped for about 2 mins and he sent a very stern email about the importance of not leaving meetings early etc etc. Over the last few weeks my team members and stakeholders are also suddenly “off” with me and I’m sure he has poisoned them against me. 

I’ve filled a grievance with HR who are “going through the process” but in the meantime he is continuing as if nothing has happened. HR do not seem overly concerned - they’ve reassured me they are dealing with it but this has been 2 months now. I’m coming to realise that I’ve been recruited as a fall guy to commit accounting fraud and that both HR & upper management are aware that my manager and his team fudge the books and they are complicit in it. 

My question: how do i handle this situation from a legal perspective? I am in a precarious financial situation with my mortgage and i cannot afford to quit. At the same time im certain im being pushed out slowly. I have no evidence accounting fraud has been committed because every time I’ve refused the work has been taken off me. And now i have no work at all so i cannot see what’s going on. We’ve also had a clean audit so clearly it has slipped by the auditors too. So I’m not sure i can whistle blow without evidence?

Hello there !! As the title says, I am looking for a casual chat partner here. It is easier said than done, to be honest, but if you are here, hopefully, we will connect. 

I am 39, a working professional who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on it, as most of us do due to wonderful communities and subs. I am married and father to a wonderful daughter who I love to the moon and back. 


So what am I seeking here? Good question, and to be honest, as an answer, I am just trying to explore and discover. Yes, at this age, I am. I have been working rigorously for the last 15 years nonstop and have given my all to my family and finances, but in the last few months, something clicked in me, and I  decided that I shall pay a bit of attention to discovering outside my monotonous life I have been living. 

Please do not judge me. I love my wife and family to the core, but this whole thing is about me, and I don't want to give an explanation about it to anyone else; perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view. 

I am a shy and introverted personality with a minimum social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say.
I give off nerd vibes - so I love technology and gadgets, and I watch a lot of sci-fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am. 

I love coffee and chocolates, I can be bribed over them.

I am open to chatting about anything, yes, anything (SFW/NSFW/mix), and if we hit it off, I don't mind it being a long-term connection. Oh! I just love the thrill of waiting for a message - the anticipation!!!

You can be anywhere in the world! Just have an open mind! If you like what I wrote, drop a Reddit message with a few lines about yourself. Also, I am not looking for any affair or relationship. Just harmless fun!

My (34F) husband (37M) of 2 years was caught having an “emotional affair” in the summer with someone who he managed at work, who was 10 years younger than him. He was messaging her constantly, flirting with her and took her on a number of dinner dates and a weekend day out. All this while he pulled away from me telling me he was “depressed”. To make matters worse we had begun looking to buy our first house and he pushed us to work on our savings so I gave up things like my Spotify account and takeaway coffee - all while he was splurging on fancy dinners for her. I found out as I found a secret insta account to talked to her and confronted him over it at which point he told me “he had been miserable with me” but had never ever shared this with me prior. Of course he begged for me to forgive him but in the meantime I decided to tell hr as I found the behaviour disgraceful and he lost his mind at me “for ruining his life”. There was an investigation at work but it came to nothing and he kept his job and is highly regarded - he still works with this girl btw.

We worked on things in marriage counselling (his decision to go and find someone to talk to) but he has spent months being furiously angry at what I did by telling hr and barely acknowledges he did anything wrong. I have spent months making space for him to calm down and talk to me about things but he just has gotten more and more angry at me, and while breadcrumbing me with hopes of our relationship (having sex, buying me gifts, spending quality time together but all when he feels like it, not on my terms) he has shown no respect for me or my boundaries in terms of his job - continued to go for drinks after work despite me sharing how upset it makes me etc. He gaslit me into thinking I am crazy if he does stay out with work. I know I have been treated so badly and have held on in the hopes that once he calmed down he would see what he has done and he would realise what we still have but my hopes are rapidly fading and I am so terrified of being alone and also consumed with grief for the person I have lost. The man I married was so open and loving and I truly believed we were soulmates and would be together until one of us passed. It’s so hard to reconcile that person with the person in front of me now.

He decided he needed space and went to his parents a few weeks ago as I was “toxic” to be around, and left me completely on my own for Christmas which hit me hard (and yet bought me lots of gifts for Christmas and took me for dinner before Christmas and told me he cared about me and was very attracted to me). The back and forth has me so emotionally upset but I know that I need to stand up for myself and set boundaries, and that doing so my husband will leave me for good.

Anyhoo, for years I would walk into the bathroom there to be greeted by any matter of crazy shit. Usually it was homeless people semi-bathing in the sink.  One time it was a dude shaving his arms. I’ve suspected drug use as well but never saw it happen. 

Recently they began locking the restroom doors, I presume because there were too many events like the ones I’ve described.  At first you had to request a code and then most recently one of the poor, nice ladies that work there had to stop what they are doing and walk me to the bathroom door and enter the code. 

Barnes and Noble had their own security for the longest time, but I guess that was more for deterrence and loss prevention, not bouncing people from bathing in the sink,  and who know what else. 

Why are businesses/ private property so impotent at proving a secure and inviting environment.  Have the police declined to help?

If my kids were buying green eggs and ham, I’d be uncomfortable with them using the bathroom there knowing they are likely to encounter a homeless person shaving their chest. 


Is there a better way to prevent vagrancy from the homeless than having a human escort to the bathroom?

The last two years of my life have been an absolute living nightmare. My now ex-husband (I'll call him Tom) went to jail for drug charges in early 2023.  We had been married for 8 years at that point and never spent a day apart. I lost my mind when he went to jail. I ended up reaching out the the suicide hotline, which, did not help but actually made things worse. I did a week stay in an inpatient program. My life then went to the bottle. I would drink before work, after work, at work. 

Then the day came that Tyler texted me. I was sitting at the lunch table and received a message from an unknown person ""Hey, I was sitting in jail with your husband, Tom, and I promised him I would throw money on his books to help out. Unfortunately the website isn't working for me.  Would I be able to send you the cash"" I laughed and told myself ""This isn't going to end well."" 

Tyler and I ended up hooking up and then dating. We got along amazingly. The drinking subsided for the most part at that time. Life was looking okay. Tyler took me into his home and my son as well. Took my son to school, swimming lessons, karate.  Tyler was good for my son, a role model he didn't have.  

Mothers day came. Tyler made an off comment about wanting Adderall and I stupidly told him I could get him something better than Adderall. Queue a year and some meth addiction that dragged us through hell.  Tyler never tried it but he was hooked the first go around. I am still ridden with guilt for ever introducing a drug into another person's life. The paranoia.....started off small thinking his boss was listening in on us(we lived above his work place) Then it turned into she bugged the apartment.  Things became unstable fast with us. During the summer of 2023, Tom was released from jail and that made nothing better. Tom and I would text about our son, being civil. Tyler was not thrilled and wanted Tom to go through him to talk to me.  The sleepless nights, the paranoia, the drug....we got to a breaking point. 

I can't remember exactly how or why it happened by Tyler kicked me out of the apartment. I left, went to stay with Tom since I had no where else to go.  Tyler snapped and packed up all of my belongings, forcing me to come gather them when I was heavily intoxicated.(then proceeds to call the cops on me after I leave to report drunk driving) He was telling me if I did not come pick up my shit, he was going to toss it. We'll, luckily he didn't actually toss anything,  but broke a lot of it...

Tyler calls me the next day and tells me to get back there now. I ran back. Cycle repeated for much longer. 

We end up moving in with his father for a month since Tyler got kicked out of the apartment. He had been high for days on end and ended up in a psychosis state. His boss had to call an ambulance and he was actually induced into a coma for a day. Living with his father was as one would have guessed,  horrible.  I got accused of sleeping with Tyler's dad. At this point in time the voice recording started. Tyler would leave his phone in random spots to catch me in the act. He would make me listen to what he recorded and ask me who I was talking to or what noises I was making. There was no recording of any thing. Just static. 

October 2023 , we sign a lease together.  The day before we signed, he ended up going to my parents and getting a no trespassing against him. We had big plans for moving to a different town. Talks of anger management,  no more drugs, healthy life style. I was excited.  And very disappointed.  First week at the new place and the cops were already at our door. The abuse continued to climb and climb. Tyler's paranoia worsened. He was putting tape over holes in the wall, taking apart electrical sockets to look for bugs, recording the shower drain, thought I hacked the tv/radio/phone/ear buds. 


2024, began the new year off with a miscarriage.  I was devastated.  He told me to stop crying because it's affecting him. For valentines day, his present to me was a fractured orbital floor and nose. I did not send him to jail. I drove myself to the ER and when I got home, comforted HIM because HE felt bad. In March, I snapped and left, finding safety with Tom. Tom saw my face. The next day, Tom was driving me back to my apartment to pull Tyler out of his own bed. Cops were called and Tyler went to jail for substantial assault.  A day into Tyler being in jail, his only brother died of a drug overdose. I felt so much pain and guilt for putting Tyler in there and then his brother passes. 

The abuse.....Tyler has been in and out of jail now. I ended up going to rehab in May for my addictions and then unto a sober living.  Tyler got out of jail when I was in sober living and demanded I come home. I was town's away, trying to better myself. I changed my phone number to stop the harassment, he then proceeded make new numbers and emails. 

I leave sober living and bounce between my sister and mom, But I am never happy. I finally give into Tyler's demands and move back in with him. He goes to jail two days later for breaking the no contact.  Been in jail since then, minus a week release where I paid for him to be out on GPS just for him to continue to hit me.

Yet, here I am, still taking his phone calls everyday. Putting money on his books. Listening to him calling me every nasty name under the sun because he truly believes I am going around and sleeping with everyone. I block him, then have a moment of weakness and unblock him. When I was in rehab, I made it an point to tell my therapist that I am addicted to a drug, alcohol,  and a man.

The guilt of bringing the drugs, ruining his mind, his brother passing while he was in jail, it's not my guilt to carry but I still do. Therapy helped greatly when I was going but unfortunately,  no health insurance now and I can't afford it. I have tried domestic abuse shelters but, first time I called them from the ER, they told me to go to a coffee shop and wait till work. Second time they told me that since I'm not in immediate danger, they can't help me(Tyler went to jail a day after that call for strangling me) 

Tyler gets out of jail soon and he's expecting to move in with me. I have thought about a restraining order but that will not stop him from busting down my door and harming me. So do I choose a slightly maybe lesser abusive path and let him move in or play with fire and get a restraining order that will only infuriate him. 

I know I need professional help to process this relationship and to heal.

I thought maybe in this subreddit I could find some people like me. Is there anyone here living in Berlin and would like to get together from time to time, have some coffee or do some activity together?

I love my job and it’s 8-5 5 days a week. 

As for goals I want to be able to enjoy time whilst I am young, I am not talking about stopping anytime soon obviously but I wouldn’t mind a little more freedom to be able to go “I want a week in X but at least I can still do something work wise whilst I am there.”

I’ve been reading a lot and I know I need multiple income streams to really make it in the future. I have of course got years of work ahead of me. 

I want to be able to do something on the move. Like in Starbucks with my coffee if you get me, on a laptop at the weekend.

Does anyone have any good suggestions for something to learn that I can just pick up when I want.

Wishing you a very healthy happy and healthy new year..

Trying yet again in 2025 - here's to optimism and not giving up.

I am a 35 year old single nerd (yes, very unique on reddit), both in personal and professional life. I am an expat living in the Netherlands but originally from India(oh dear, Indian, run away!! )

Still here?... well read on..

I have been away from home for more than 12 years, for both educational and professional reasons. Last 2 years were spent in the Netherlands. I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been more than a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am looking for a connection - be it just friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but there is much work to be done. The latter part has been harder as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within short distances.

If my post resonates with you, do reach out and please leave an introduction.

Between me (21f) and him (21m), I'm more of a quality time type of person while he's more onto physical touch.

Buuut in private, good lord I'm actually AHDHJDKSKA. Words cannot describe how much I LOVE THIS MAN but I'll try. 

The way he smiles. The way he sings. The way he styles his hair. The way he holds his hand out when we're going down a flight of stairs cuz he knows I trip a lot. The way he orders my favorite coffee without me telling him. The way he smiles. The way he keeps track of my menstrual cycle more often than me. The way dresses himself. THE WAY HE SMILES!!!!!

Whenever I talk about to those who ask, I always talk about his looks, to which people say I sound shallow. BUT HEAR ME OUT! If my man is handsome, OF COURSE I'D BRAG ABOUT IT. I'm telling everyone how good he smells, how perfect the shape of his nose is. The way his lips are thin yet soft. The unique shape of his eyebrows... aND I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT HIS FACE. Imagine if I went on and on about his shoulders, his arms, etc etc.

I could go on and on but right know he says he wants to watch me renovate am apartment in Sims 4 so I'll be doing that. He knows I love him A LOT but I'm pretty sure I should show it more to actually portray how I always feel.

Hot dork here. Life is feeling a little bit too plain for me right now, so I'd like to change it up. I'm looking for a sense of fun and adventure. I don't know exactly what that will entail, but I'm pretty open minded. It could anything from chats, sightseeing, and more. Anything on your bucket list you'd like to tick off?

I'm a well-educated professional that works in London doing boring spreadsheety stuff. Outside of that, I play in a band and really enjoy live music. I'm hoping to see more bands this year! Otherwise, I like mediocre male Redditor activities such as video games, reading, running, and buying overpriced coffee.

I have a Nespresso Maestria that I’ve had since it came on the market, which is like 13 years or something.  Well used and loved! Recently it’s been very slow and the cup size shrinking, so I thought it was time to descale it. I’m running the program now, but the machine is not cooperating and has been stuck on blinking for probably an hour now… 

So I’m thinking maybe it’s time to get a new one, but which one?! 

Personally I like Nespresso because it’s very convenient for someone like me who is not that big of a coffee drinker, but still likes the occasional cup. In other words, I just need a basic coffee machine. I’m leaning towards Vertuo, but there are several different types to choose from —> next; premium and deluxe. They all look pretty similar so I’m not sure which one to choose. The issue is not really the price difference between the models, just wondering what exactly I’m getting for the most expensive vs the cheapest one. (All of them are on discount atm). Is it just the design/material, or are there other differences I should know of?

So, I took Wellbutrin 150ml XL for approx 3 weeks. First couple of doses gave me a rush a bit like I've just had a too strong coffee. That subsided after maybe the 4th dose. Aside from that, I felt no real effects. In the second week I experienced 3 days of extreme fatigue and low motivation. Again, that passed. 3rd week, tinnitus started. I convinced myself that's it, this drug isn't for me and stopped. It has now been 8 days. Tinnitus is still there, no improvement. Last couple of days I've suddenly developed crippling anxiety, nausea and a fever. I've been unable to eat today. Tinnitus is even worse. 

I'm trying to reassure myself that this will all pass but it's really, really miserable. 

My question relates to tinnitus. No amount of white noise or neck stretching improves it. 

If it's caused by changes in dopaminergic neurotransmitters... surely, surely this can be manipulated back? Or adjusted somehow?",2,1736073346.0,bupropion,1,1.0,False
1hu46lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/1hu46lf/there_are_days_when_i_want_to_scream/,There are days when I want to scream.,"There are days when I want to scream. Days when I knock over my coffee cup for the third time, when I can't find my phone that's blaring right next to me, when I miss the simplest things I used to take for granted. Days when I'm sick of being brave, of being inspiring, of being everyone's lesson in perseverance.

Let me be honest – losing my sight didn't make me a better person. It made me angry. Terrified. Sometimes it still does. I spent months grieving not just for the loss of vision, but for the loss of the life I had planned. Simple things became mountains to climb. Reading a menu. Crossing a street. Knowing if my clothes match. The independence I took for granted crumbled like sand between my fingers.

But here's what they don't tell you about going blind: your other senses don't magically become superhuman. You have to work at it. Hours of orientation and mobility training. Countless bruises from misjudged doorways. Endless frustration learning to use a screen reader. It's not a gift – it's a hard-won adaptation.

Yet somewhere in that struggle, something shifted. Not in some dramatic movie moment, but in small, quiet ways. I learned to recognize my friends by the rhythm of their footsteps down the hallway. I discovered that rain creates a different symphony on every surface it touches – leaves, metal, glass, concrete. I found that hands can see in their own way, that touch can read stories in the texture of bark, the warmth of sun-heated stone, the delicate architecture of a flower.

My apartment has become a landscape of sound and texture. The creak of that third floorboard that warns me I'm near the kitchen. The subtle change in air temperature that tells me I'm passing a window. The way voices bounce off walls differently in each room, creating an acoustic map of my space. My cat's purring has become my compass, leading me to wherever she's chosen to nap.

I won't lie and say I'm grateful for blindness. I'm not. But I'm grateful for what it's taught me about human resilience, about the vastness of experience beyond visual perception, about the depth of connection possible when you can't rely on surface appearances.

To those who can see: Notice everything. The way light changes the color of ordinary things. The expressions that flicker across faces. The dance of leaves in wind. Notice it all, deeply, hungrily. Not because you might lose it one day, but because it's there, now, waiting to be truly seen.

And to those in darkness: Your rage is valid. Your grief is valid. Your journey is your own. But know this – there is a world beyond sight, rich and full and worth discovering. Not because blindness is a blessing, but because human beings are remarkably, stubbornly adaptable. We find ways. We always find ways.

This isn't a story about overcoming disability. It's a story about continuing to live, fully and authentically, when life fundamentally changes. Sometimes that means crying in frustration. Sometimes it means laughing at yourself when you try to high-five someone and miss completely. Always, it means moving forward, one step at a time, into a different way of being in the world.

- No regular sleeping schedule
- No exercise
- Not eating well
- Twice coffee a day
- Always lying in bed spending time in the internet

Last New Year’s eve the last thing I drink was Pineapple juice in can and that’s my first encounter of small pains in my heart which is tolerable and I can ignore.

2 days later I woke up feeling nervous. I can feel a pain in my heart or chest pain(?). It’s something like there’s something placed above my heart and I acid refluxed (?) 4 times. I vomit like white colored saliva or as far as I know it is acid reflux.

I immediately went to the hospital and the doctor assessed it as GERD. I’m so worried and at panic but I dont know why the doctor take it so lightly like it is very common.

The doctor gave me 2 medicines

1. Opremazole (Before breakfast)
2. Celecoxib (When Im feeling pain)

I need tests (ECG, 2D echo, and Blood chem). I cannot go back to the hospital yet because I cannot sleep!!

I’m feeling something in my chest which makes it hard for me to sleep.

Also question is does heart palpitations have to do something with gerd? Or should I blame my anxiety for this, or BOTH

I saw in the internet to drink very cold water with alot of ice to decrease the palpitation


Please help me understand this while I cannot go back yet to be tested and get my next doctor appointment

1hu3yho,https://www.reddit.com/r/phlgbt/comments/1hu3yho/i_met_someone_i_regret_meeting/,I met someone I regret meeting ," 24 M young professional. Madalas ako nasa g app for fun lang. Wala akong motivation maghanap ng relationship doon or in real life haha. Ikwento ko lang recent experience ko para lang di ko sarilinin lols. In the past I met someone na ang dp niya ay compilation of people in the app praising his good looks. I remember ako unang nagchat sa kaniya pero siya ang unang nagsend ng photos niya. Gwapo talaga siya sa album niya, undeniably. So ayon, nagkasundo kami to meet. To be honest, siguro dahil sa profile niya sa g app, I was expecting too much. Pero when I met him, he looks older mga siguro 5 years older than sa album photos niya. Nonetheless, cute pa rin siya and ako average looks lang if not pangit so g pa rin naman. Nag-fun tapos nilibre ko siya lunch and coffee, tapos uwi na.

Nung nakauwi kami, he was claiming na hindi ako yung sinend kong photos. Then I proceeded to send more photos para iprove sa kaniya na ako yon. He apologized and then I thought he blocked me (pero sabi niya nag-delete lang daw siya ng app). From that point on, I felt hanging dahil parang ok naman interactions namin bago kami maghiwalay, tapos ganon. 

I deleted the app for a couple weeks and then gumawa ulit ako ng bagong account. I saw his profile, nagchat ako. Ang mali ko I offered to pay him, siguro kasi that time sobrang horny ko tapos siya yung biglang nakita ko na kilala ko na doon so para mabilis nag-offer nalang ako. He respectfully declined. Gets naman. Pero he proceeded to say na mas ok if wholesome na date nalang daw ganon or anything na may substance. Tbh, ok ako sa ganon dahil siguro minsan lang ako magka-free time sa line of work ko kaya sabi ko g ako. Here's the catch, kaso wala siyang pera kahit pamasahe daw. Sabi ko, no problem ako bahala. Naiinis ako sa sarili ko pag naaalala ko haha. So we agreed to watch a movie around 12 PM tanghali, tumawad siya mga 12:30 daw para sure. Noong nakarating na ako sa pupuntahan namin, 30 mins late siya, which is kinda ok naman siguro normally pero ako kasi sobrang particular ko sa time plus the fact that pinastretch niya pa yung time. 

So ayon nagkita na kami, nanood ng movie, libre ko lahat to since ako naman nag-aya. Alam mo, I hate it so much kung gaano ako ka-observant. During the movie, he was constantly checking his phone. Siguro akala niya di ko napapansin pero ang weird lang ng way niya magtago, nakikita ko pa rin sa peripheral vision ko na gapp yung chinecheck niya constantly. Nawalan na ako ng gana noon. Saka di ko rin ramdam energy niya, sobrang yapper and malakas yung boses niya at tawa. Nasa climax na ng movie, nakita ko siyang matululog, may subtle hilik siya hahaha. And then pag nagigising siya he pretends as if nagrereact siya sa movie, pero anlayo naman ng reaction niya kaya ang weird talaga. This point, gusto ko nang umalis parang out na talaga ako. Pero out of hiya or awa siguro tinuloy ko pa rin. Nasa isip ko kasi, ako na nga sumagot sa lahat. The least he can do is to not be an asshole. Ewan ko ba HAHAHA. 

Andaming tao sa mall so nag-aya ako na lumabas kami sa something cozy lang na place. Nag-lunch kami, on me. Tapos habang nag-uusap kami, parang naoobserve ko na sa kaniya na wala siyang pake sa usapan and he's just trying to be polite. So ayon nag-quit na ako sa conversation, sabi ko may errands pa akong pupuntahan. Then nakita ko nanaman siyang nagbukas ng g app. Like, sana di niya na masyadong pinapahalata kasi ang asshole move non 😭. Tapos nakalimutan ko kasi siyang bigyan ng pamasahe pauwi so nanghingi siya. Binigyan ko nalang siya ng 150 pesos haha. Pero ako pa rin nagbayad ng una niyang jeep so I guess kasya na iyon. 

Trauma malala talaga. This point nagegets ko yung mga mali kong ginawa pero kine-question ko pa rin if I led him into these behaviors niya or ganon lang talaga siya. Ayon lang baka boring and mahaba skip niyo nalang haha.

1hu3x2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/cliobra/comments/1hu3x2q/how_to_monetize_your_website_proven_strategies/,How to Monetize Your Website: Proven Strategies That Work,"Does your website get traffic but not dollars?

Are you stuck wondering how all these folks online are making it big while your site is barely paying for its hosting?

Here’s the truth: **monetizing a website isn’t rocket science**.

It’s about finding the right strategy for your audience and executing it well.

Let’s break this down so it feels like a chat over coffee, no fluff, no cringe.

# Top Ways to Monetize Your Website

# 1. Sell Products or Services

You’ve got traffic—now sell something.

Physical goods, digital products, courses, or services.

**Examples:**

* Got a knack for photography? Sell presets or prints.
* Run a fitness blog? Launch a workout plan or 1-on-1 coaching.

**Pro Tip:** Use Shopify or WooCommerce.

It’s plug-and-play, so you focus on sales instead of setup.

# 2. Affiliate Marketing

Don’t want to create your own products? Promote someone else’s.

Sign up for affiliate programs (Amazon Associates, ClickBank) and get paid commissions for every sale through your link.

Stat Fact: **Affiliate marketers can earn 5% to 30% commissions,** depending on the product and company.

**Example:** A travel blogger could link to travel gear or booking platforms. When readers click and buy? Cha-ching!

# 3. Sponsored Content

Brands are always hunting for eyeballs.

If your site gets decent traffic, offer them ad space or create content that features their products.

*Example:* Food bloggers often partner with kitchen brands for recipes that showcase their tools.

But here’s the thing: **stay authentic.**

Readers know when you’re faking it.

# 4. Memberships & Subscriptions

Got unique content people would pay for? Make it exclusive.

**What works:**

* Tutorials, niche forums, or deep-dive reports.
* Exclusive access to a VIP community (look at Reddit Premium).

Stat Fact: Some membership sites report up to **80% annual retention rates.**

# 5. Ads That Pay You (Passive Income)

Set up Google AdSense, display ads, or even direct ad placements.

Ads work well if your site gets a ton of traffic.

Stat Fact: Expect $0.10 to $1.00 per click, depending on niche and engagement.

But don’t go overboard.

A site that looks like an ad carnival? No one stays long enough to read.

# 6. Use ClickFunnels to Skyrocket Revenue

ClickFunnels isn’t just a tool—it’s a goldmine.

It lets you create sales funnels that guide visitors step-by-step to make a purchase.

Why it rocks:

* **Built for conversion:** These funnels are designed to maximize sales.
* **Automation galore:** Set it up once, and let it do the selling for you.

If you’ve got a product or service, ClickFunnels is like having a 24/7 salesperson on your site.

# 7. Offer Consulting or Freelancing Services

If your blog builds authority in a niche, offer consulting.

Turn your expertise into cash by offering coaching, services, or 1-on-1 calls.

Example: A finance blog could pitch budgeting sessions or financial planning.

# 8. Ask for Donations (Works for Passion Projects)

Got a loyal audience who loves your work?

Add a “donate” button or use platforms like Patreon to get direct support.

This is perfect for non-profits, artists, or niche creators.

It works *if* your audience believes in your mission.

# The Big Picture

**Monetization isn’t a one-size-fits-all game.**

Test multiple methods.

Tweak and double down on what works.

Stat Fact: A combination of 2-3 monetization strategies often yields the highest ROI.

**Here’s the mindset:** Your website is a business.

Every visitor is an opportunity.

Had a few questions regarding the Haven and beverages on the cruise in general, I was hoping to get advise on...never cruised before.

1. As I understand it, only the adults 21+ get the More at Sea beverage package promotion. Therefore, if traveling with kids, do we have to purchase the Unlimited Soda package separately in order for the kids to enjoy decent drinks within the ship or if they want sodas or juice brought to the Haven room? Or are sodas and juices for kids already included as part of the Haven?

2. I am aware that Haven rooms have a Nespresso machine, however, in the Haven area, is coffee or a latte ordered at the restaurant or bar included in the More at Sea beverage package promotion? Or are you charged extra?
