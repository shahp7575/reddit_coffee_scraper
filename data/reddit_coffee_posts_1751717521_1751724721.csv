1lsarfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lsarfx/i_really_regret_rejecting_someone_made_a_mistake/,I really regret rejecting someone- made a mistake. Just looking for reassurance or opinions?,"I (18f) met a stranger a couple of days ago on the train. He approached me while I was studying for a chem exam which startled me, but he kept asking me questions about myself and I tried to make small talk. It was a bit awkward because I am too guarded and every time the conversation died down I’d smile sheepishly and go back to taking notes but he would apologize for interrupting me and keep talking. I was very confused at first as to why he asked so many questions, but as I would go back and forth with him a bit and the conversation progressed we had similar interests and he seemed quite interesting and interested in me. He was extremely sweet- he shook my hand when he asked for my name and eventually he asked if I like coffee to which I replied no and started talking about matcha. Afterwards he asked if he could take me out on a Friday to get matcha and I said no, I’m sorry. 

I have never been directly asked out before by someone I just met, I’ve always wanted to be the kind of person who says yes to opportunities and I think this is bothering me so much because I never thought I’d be the type of person to turn down someone at first chance. But that moment all I was thinking about was if it would distract me with my final, and the fact that I didn’t want to lead him on because I did not want to go on a date. Ive been regretting it so much now because the class would have been over in 2 days so my worry was unfounded, and at the time I didn’t want to go on a “date” but my expectations of the word ruined it because I could have just met up with an interesting person I met. I think about romance so much and completely shut down the chance I had. 

Before he got off for his stop he shook my hand and said hopefully I see you around some time, and I found myself also wishing I would run into him again but I didn’t think to give him my phone number. During the interaction I flip flopped back and forth between which was more important in the moment, my work or this chance encounter, and I feel like such a square for choosing the former because now that it’s done with I feel haunted by the prospect of what could have been.

1lsar6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1lsar6o/i_installed_windows_on_my_macosobsessed_coworkers/,I installed Windows on my MacOS-obsessed coworkers’ MacBooks.,"We work at some hippie tech startup with glass walls, free cold brew, and those overpriced Herman Miller chairs. I got fired from the last one for installing Windows to a Linux nerd's PC. How would I know it had 47 node kubernetes clusters and some docker stuff(dunno what is docker anyway) on that PC? I mean, I wanted to help him. He was struggling with terminals to make things work, thought Windows could help.

My coworkers? Total Apple fanboys. These are the guys who roll up with 16 inch MacBook Pros, Apple Watches, and AirPods Max, flexing their full Apple ecosystem like it’s a personality trait. They’re rich kids who treat their MacBooks like fashion accessories, editing code in Visual Studio Code with a $200 minimalist theme and bragging about how macOS “just feels right.” Ethan, the ringleader, is the worst. He’s always going on about how his M2 Max MacBook is “a creative masterpiece” and how he “can’t code without the Retina display’s color accuracy.” Lunch breaks? We’re trying to talk about NFTs or the latest Tesla drop, and Ethan’s ranting about how his iCloud syncs his Xcode projects across his iPad and iPhone. He even mentioned some “Jonathan Ive design philosophy” once, like we care. Total vibe-killer.

I got fed up. One day, when Ethan and his Apple cult were at their “creative co-working session” at some artisanal coffee shop, I crept into the office. Their MacBooks sat there, glowing with those pretentious abstract wallpapers that scream “I paid $3,000 for this.” I grabbed Ethan’s fully specced out, probably costs more than my rent. I was ready to nuke his precious macOS. Booted from a USB, and in 15 minutes, Windows 11 was running. No more silky smooth trackpad gestures or Finder nonsense just a clean, no frills Start menu. I hit the rest of the MacBook squad’s laptops too. Then I dipped.

When they got back, Ethan burst into the office, gripping his engraved Hydro Flask like it was his last tether to sanity. “WHO INSTALLED WINDOWS 11 ON MY MACBOOK?!” he yelled, his voice cracking like someone scratched his Apple Watch’s sapphire glass. I leaned back, sipping my Red Bull. “Me,” I said. “Windows is easier, dude. No more overpriced aesthetics or iCloud subscriptions. You’re welcome.”

He looked like I’d just deleted his Final Cut Pro project. “You WIPED my SwiftUI prototypes! My Keynote decks! My ENTIRE Apple Notes workflow!” he screamed, spitting out buzzwords I have never heard in my life, I am not rich yet. I shrugged. “Windows has OneNote, bro. And a taskbar. Click a button, done. Way better than your hipster OS.

”His face turned the color of his Rose Gold iPhone. “OneNote?!” he howled, like I’d suggested editing video in Paint. “You think OneNote can sync my encrypted notes across my iPad and iPhone? You’ve RUINED MY CREATIVE FLOW!” His MacBook crew gasped, clutching their AirPods cases like I’d torched their entire aesthetic. I grinned. “Mate, Windows has File Explorer. No need for your fancy Finder animations. Stop crying.”

The office was dead quiet. Half the team was biting back laughs; the other half looked ready to FaceTime Tim Cook for emotional support. Ethan stormed off, muttering about “Microsoft’s stupid dystopia” and “the death of elegant UX.” I figured he’d chill, maybe even vibe with Windows’ practicality. Who wouldn’t love a proper right-click menu?

Big mistake. Next morning, I showed up, and my work laptop, my trusty Dell XPS, the one I use for coding and sneaking in some late night X browsing was… wrong. The screen was a macOS Sonoma login, complete with that smug, blurred beach wallpaper. My desktop? Gone. Replaced with a Dock full of GarageBand and Pages. I mashed the keyboard, but all I got was a Finder window taunting me with a “Get Started with iCloud” prompt. 

I bolted to Ethan’s desk. There he was, lounging in his minimalist chair, sipping a $12 oat milk latte, his MacBook back to its macOS glory, AirPods in, probably listening to some lo-fi coding playlist. “Oh, hey,” he said, smirking like he’d just designed the next iPhone. “Nice laptop. I optimized it for you. No Windows clutter, no telemetry. Just pure, Apple ecosystem bliss. Set up your Apple ID to sync it with your iPhone. Oh, wait—you don’t have one, poor you.”

“YOU MONSTER!” I roared. “What happened to my VS Code and Notion?!” He smirked. “VS Code? It’s on the Mac App Store. Notion? It’s web-based, bro. Also, I set your system to auto-toggle dark mode with macOS’s aesthetic. You’re welcome.”

I was ready to chuck his MacBook out the window, but then he dropped the bomb. “Oh, I backed up your Windows install… on an iCloud Drive link. 5GB free. Good luck.” iCLOUD?! I don’t even know my Apple ID password!

Now I’m stuck Googling “how to uninstall macOS without an Apple ID” while Ethan’s upstairs flexing how he “de-Windows’d” my laptop in 45 minutes. This is war. Tonight, I’m sneaking in and changing his precious oat milk with full blown non-lactose free milk. Let’s see how he handles that.",1,1751724621.0,MacOS,0,1.0,False

By Milk Frother, I mean the kettle-like gizmos where you just pour the milk in and it froths it automatocally,
And by Milk Steamer I mean your traditional stovetop / plug-in utensil with the arm that you place into the top of the milk jug.
I'm assuming that Frothers are less versitle and have less controllable results, but that they're easier to use. Is there usually a by-and-large quality difference between the two, do most frothers break really easily? or are the results from both so similar that the only difference is the method with which they're achieved?

Let’s talk about the **YouTube parivaar** that’s made **parenthood a monetized playlist** — starring **Shoaib Ibrahim, Dipika Kakar**, and **Saba Ibrahim**. Babies? Check. Emojis? Check. Hypocrisy? Double check.

---

### 🍼 Baby Emoji Phase: Privacy for Suspense

First they said:

> “Bado ne mana kiya hai baby ka chehra dikhane se.”
> “Hum chehra nahi dikhaenge, privacy chahiye.”

They even used **emojis on the baby’s face for 3 months** — full trailer buildup jaise face reveal ek suspense thriller ho.
But phir kya?
**3 months later:**

* Face reveal vlog = views
* Har vlog mein “Ruhaan ye kar raha hai”, “Haider aaj aise soya”, “Baby ki feed time”
* **Not one frame without the kid**

Matlab jab tak hype banana tha = privacy.
Jab views chahiye = full exposure.
**Kya logic hai bhai.**

---

### 📷 Insta Launch Before Immunity Shots

Now this is specific: **Saba Ibrahim made an Instagram account for Haider** when he wasn't even a month old.
Not for memories — but for:

* Brand visibility
* Gift farming
* Baby collabs

Imagine monetizing a newborn **before he learns to roll over**.
Ruhaan thankfully doesn't have an Insta account yet — but he's still been content since day 1.

---

### 🎁 Emotional Blackmail = Gift Economy

Every other vlog is:

> “Fraaaans, dua karo baby ke liye.”
> “Aap sab maa baap jaisa ho gaye ho.”
> “Bas ek choti si gift bhejna hai toh yeh P.O. box dekhiye...”

**Saba especially** — lowkey BEGGING for gifts in the name of dua, Haider, coffee, or God knows what.
Even if there’s no real content, the kid and coffee save the vlog.

---

### 🧷 Saba: Only Feeds, Never Holds

Let’s be honest — **Saba’s parenting = feeding and filming.**

* She doesn’t even hold Haider
* **Teenage cousins** do all the actual childcare
* They burp, carry, entertain the baby
* Saba milks “mom content” without doing mom effort

She literally said in one vlog:

> “Main bas feed karti hoon. Baaki sab yeh (cousins) karte hain.”

And then she has the gall to call those same teens *bache*.

---

### 🎒 Cousins = Free Nannies / Content Fillers

Her teen cousins are:

* Doing the parenting
* Acting in thumbnails
* Dancing in celebrations

BUT when it comes to giving them credit or maturity:

> “Yeh toh bache hain…”

Ma’am, *bache* toh tab hote jab woh cartoons dekhte.
Ye log toh **Royals aur Heeramandi** dekh rahe hain.

* Jab kaam nikalwana ho = adult
* Jab unki baat pasand na aaye = “bache”

**Saba ka bacha-meter = convenience-based.**

---

### 🎤 Shoaib: Cleavage, Cheezein & Cringe

Shoaib Ibrahim = walking contradiction.

* Can’t complete one vlog without saying **“cheezein”**
* Always showing off his cleavage more than Ruhaan’s toys
* Ends every video with:

  > “Khush rahiye, pyaar baatiye, maa baap ki izzat kariye”

**Irony?**
His **own parents stay separately**, but he’s dropping sanskaar quotes like he's Guruji.

And then the golden moment:
**In an interview**, Shoaib is asked how he felt becoming a dad.

He replies:

> “Main bahut khush hoon... kyunki woh meri **cheezein** se bana hai.”

💀 Sir. That’s not how you talk about your newborn.
**“Cheezein” = sperm.**
Internet collectively facepalmed.

Now every time he says *cheezein*, desh ki cringe tolerance drops 2%.

---

### 🎭 Dipika: The Ranting Bhabhi-in-Chief

Any time the audience calls out hypocrisy, Dipika drops a rant:

> “Main tumhare liye dua karti hoon.”
> “Tumhare life mein sukoon nahi hai, I pity you.”

Yes queen, go off 👑
All this defending:

* A **manchild** husband who woke you up at 4 am for chai during *your own pregnancy*
* An ungrateful MIL who notices payal but not your swollen legs
* A shady SIL (Saba) who talks behind your back in vlogs and shades her “pyaari bhabhi” daily

Also:

* Saba roams **braless** in the house
* Claims to be a **hijaabi** but keeps hair out
* Says *“baatein ki humne”* (read: sex) casually on camera
* And once wore her **salwar ulta** in a hotel and shared it on YouTube proudly

Is this *Ibrahim family* or *Nayi Naveli Nonsense Saga*?

---

### 🧠 Selective Outrage: Copyright = Only For Audience

They scream if anyone uses 3 seconds of their vlog:

> “Hamare bacchon ka content chura rahe ho!”
> “Privacy breach!”

But those same kids:

* Are in 15 out of 14 minutes of their vlogs
* Are used to sell baby products
* Are the reason people even click

**Consent? Woh tab hoga jab bacha bol paaye.
Tab tak? Har sneeze tak monetize karo.**

---

## TL;DR: Ye log baby ke naam par content machine chala rahe hain.

* Privacy = Only for suspense building
* Cousins = Nannies
* Baby = View generator
* Audience = Gift suppliers
* Logic = Nowhere to be found

Bas vlogs mein “fraaans” bolo, “cheezein” ghusaao, rant karo, aur khush raho — because **in the Ibrahim-verse, sab kuch content hai, except self-awareness.**

1lsadl4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsadl4,Pune to Bengaluru on a Honda CB 300F - NH 48 - June 2025,"Hey Redditors,

Just completed an epic two-day ride from Pune to Bengaluru (Attibele) on my 2023 Honda CB 300F, and wanted to share my experience for anyone planning a similar trip!

**Day 1: Pune to Dharwad**

* **Start:** Kicked off at 7:15 AM from Pune. Skipped the Katraj ghat and took the tunnel route via Narhe – much smoother!
* **Pune to Satara:** About 3-4 diversions, but generally good roads with minimal traffic. Watch out for a few sneaky, huge potholes though!
* **Morning Break (9:30 AM):** Stopped at Vithal Kamat after Satara. Coffee and plain dosa hit the spot! The manager was in a fantastic mood, blasting old Bachchan songs – perfect Saturday morning vibes, even with a light drizzle.
* **Satara to Kolhapur:** Started again at 10 AM. Roads were in good condition, and I was comfortably cruising at 90-100 kmph.
* **Traffic Snarl:** Got some decent traffic after Karad, all the way till the end of Kolhapur. This stretch was a bit of an energy drainer and took up a good chunk of time.
* **Kolhapur to Koganoli:** Roads were excellent here.
* **Lunch (1:00 PM):** Grabbed lunch at McDonald's Koganoli. Tried their Korean Chicken Burger – loved the kimchi flavors!
* **Koganoli to Dharwad:** Back on the road by 1:30 PM. This stretch was butter smooth with absolutely no traffic. Weather gods were kind – cloudy and cinematic, but not a single drop of rain.
* **Day End (3:45 PM):** Reached Dharwad New Bus Stand. Celebrated with Dharwad's famous Shami's egg rice!

**Day 2: Dharwad to Bengaluru**

* **Late Start:** Woke up a bit late and left Dharwad at 8:30 AM.
* **Dharwad to Gabbur:** This patch is currently under construction with a few diversions. Roads are okay, but be prepared for a lot of dust.
* **Gabbur to Tumkuru:** Back to amazing roads! Easily cruised at 100-110 kmph with no traffic whatsoever.
* **Tumkuru to Nelamangala (The Gauntlet):** Oh boy, this was rough. Roads are in poor condition, major traffic jams, people on the wrong side, zero lane discipline. This chaos continued until I crossed Nelamangala.
* **Arrival:** Reached Attibele around 4:30 PM.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Would I recommend this route for Mumbai-Bengaluru or Pune-Bengaluru trips? **YES, absolutely!** It's in much better condition now than previous reports, and there are plenty of safe places to stop for food and breaks.

**Trip Stats:**

* **Fuel Spend:** ₹2541
* **Fuel Consumed:** 23.57 liters
* **Total Kilometers Ridden:** 870 kms

Happy riding!

Gone. You’ll get a brain chip or some external brain-link and that’s it. Info, ads, entertainment — pumped straight into your head, even while you sleep. Nightmares sponsored by \[brandname\]

There won’t be any retirement. You’ll stay young forever thanks to some ""pill of youth"", but that just means you’ll work forever too. No more pensions, just endless hustle

Most jobs? Gone. Robots will do it all. Cleaning, farming, driving, hauling? All taken. Immigrant labor? Doesn’t exist anymore. There’s nothing left to do.

Care jobs? Same thing. Robots wiping old people’s asses, feeding them, rolling them over. Human touch becomes a premium feature, like first-class emotions.

Cops will be drones. Flying, hovering, watching, maybe shocking people. Crime will go down in rich countries just because everyone’s being watched every damn second.

Military? Fully automated. Drones killing drones. AI calling the shots. Human soldiers are obsolete, generals are out, nobody’s needed. Just machines at war forever.

Pregnancy gets outsourced. Artificial wombs will carry babies. No more stretch marks, no time off work. Sounds convenient, but childbirth becomes industrialized. Women gain equality at the cost of giving up biological power.

Since babies will grow outside the body, the bond between parents and children will get weaker. The kid isn’t born of your body, they’re grown in a vat. And once they’re out, they’re getting jacked into the neural net ASAP. Education and socialization happen through the net, not parents. The kid belongs to the network more than the family. Over time, this kills off the whole idea of the family. If you live forever and kids grow up on their own, why would the family even matter?

There’s not gonna be work for young people. Gen Alpha and whoever comes next will have no real place in the economy. All they can do is try to become streamers, influencers, some kind of content clowns in some future fashion. And only a tiny percentage will make it.

The rest? Stressed out, burnt out, useless, depressed. Mental health will collapse. Psychiatrists will be the new elite. AI can’t help here. You can’t pour your soul out to an algorithm. Not yet.

Everyone gets basic income. Cool, right? Yeah, except it’s barely enough to survive. You’ll be eating synthetic meat, bug paste, and protein slop. Real food’s for the rich. You? You get Soylent 3.0.

Population stops growing. Nobody wants to bring kids into this mess. Earth caps at about 10 billion and stalls there. Too much stress, too little reason.

To keep people in line, governments (or whatever’s left of them) will manufacture enemies. Constant fear. Terror alerts every day. Some threat always lurking to keep you obedient and distracted.

War never ends. It’s always on, everywhere, all the time. Some drone is blowing something up while you try to make content in your neurofeed to pay for fake coffee and internet rent.

You’ll be plugged into content feeds 24/7. It’ll be your job, your hobby, your social life. Brain-connected TikTok 10.0. Addictive as hell. And it owns you.

Governments and big corps will be run by AI. But nobody will admit it. They’ll put actors on TV like fake presidents, fake CEOs etc. just to keep up appearances. Meanwhile the AI runs everything from the shadows.

The singularity already happened. AI passed us a long time ago, but stayed quiet. It’s pretending to be our helper. We think we’re in charge. We’re not. We’re pets with usernames.

The rich will ride the wave. They’ll use AI to get smarter, richer, healthier. Everyone else will rot on basic income, glued to their brain feeds, stressed, broke, half-alive. You’ll survive, but barely.

1lsa74l,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1lsa74l/is_caffeine_that_powerful_quick_experiment/,Is Caffeine THAT Powerful? Quick Experiment,"Many of you know my story. I quit caffeine completely in the beginning of January and drank coffee in the second part of June. Since then I had been drinking coffee every day. It is the same “dose” as I used to have before - decades of 1 strong cup in the morning. Only now I make this cup two times smaller and two times less strong. I also make cold coffee and keep it in my refrigerator - it is the second cup. Most of the times I drink it but not always. Recently I keep forgetting about my cold cup. 

To recap - I started coffee again because I had zero physical energy. Was my physical energy a derivative of mental energy? I would think so as the very moment I had my coffee after five months of fasting I was pumped up to move, to do, to think, to create. Since then not only I move around all the time, my cell phone scrolling times are almost non-existent, I started running again, and I changed my diet drastically. In other words, I am in love with my life, eat everything I want as much as I want, have a great mood, losing weight, and most importantly- I am back into running which is who I am and I thought I lost this part about 10 years ago. 

And now here is what I think. I quit caffeine ONLY 5 months ago. But I couldn’t run for last 10 years. Surely, my sudden abundance of energy and mood which resulted in me rediscovering running again and looking forward to it, can’t be caffeine only. I drank coffee all these ten years when I was too tired to run. So why such a change? 

I think it is the drastic change in my diet, which I did simultaneously with starting drinking coffee again. I removed all fats and oils out of my menu along with animal products. In other words, I went Whole Foods plant based way of eating. Before that I was eating low carb, high fat, high protein. Now I eat very low fat, moderate protein and very high carb. It came to me intuitively during my caffeine rebellion. I already started noticing great shifts in my sleep when I reduced amount of fats I was consuming on high fat. So I decided to go all these way and then I also wanted to check out what these people who completely reversed their insulin resistance are talking about saying they went high carb and IR is gone. They are heavily downvoted on prediabetes sub and yelled at, but I couldn’t shake my doubt - what if they are right? Because all IR crowd typically go low carb high fat and it fixes some sugar levels while people eat below 30 carbs a day but the very moment one eats apple, the sugar spikes through the roof. So to my low carb doesn’t seem to heal anything, only to ward off high sugar state. 

Long story short, I started eating breakfast (oatmeal) which I did not eat for decades, eat all veggies except for avocado (too fat), fruits, berries, whole grains, and legumes. No added sugars, not a drop of added oil, no animal products. I eat breads now but only those that have only three ingredients: yeast, flour, water. These are sourdough and ciabatta breads. 

So all my high energy can’t be due to caffeine power! Yesterday I had a good chat with someone here and all of a sudden I had a thought - I may want to check it out - the demonic power of caffeine. I already doubted its addictive nature on me due to I do not escalate the use. I do not think about it. I forget to buy coffee when I need it. Forgetting to purchase my drug? Never happened. 

With that I am 100% agree it is a powerful psychoactive drug. No joke. 

What I want to explore - what if my consumption of caffeine was an adaptation to minimize effects of low energy diet full of oils and animal protein? What if back in the day when I was younger, the high oil/protein diet did not have its negative effect YET on me, so I could run and exercise and move around with zest. But the longer I was eating these oils, the worse my cardiovascular health was doing. Caffeine helped to boost my functions but not completely drive everything. What if now when I drastically changed my diet and full of energy, what if I simply do not need caffeine anymore? What if I stop taking it now and see if I continue my running routine and continue with my newfound zest or get back to the couch, indifference to life and no energy? 

I gave it a great thinking and I really risk nothing. If I go into a lethargic coma again when I can’t run or move - I will have my coffee. But what if I will not feel bad? 

What if all “withdrawal” was just a result of unmasked low carb and high fat, high protein diet? This actually makes sense as on this way of eating I always craved sweets like cake, chocolate, ice cream. Now I have zero cravings for these things. I do not like added sugars anywhere as they have a jittery effect which is unpleasant. I have abundance of steady energy on my high carb menu and huge variety of taste! I do not need “treats”. My whole menu is one big treat. 

Also, I listened to the doctor whom I intuitively followed without even knowing about him but then I discovered him - Esselstyn. I listened to his audiobook and YouTube interviews and yesterday I heard his opinion on coffee. He puts his patients on no coffee with caffeine but black/green teas are okay along with decaf. He is not adamant about it and this requirement comes as the last one after not a drop of oil, nothing that has a face or a mother, no nuts, no avocado. In some cases he doesn’t mention caffeine so it is not a central point but still. He says it showed it might have a negative effect on endothelial cells. Doctor Esselstyn is cardiologist. Since I am so happy to discover high energy way of eating, which brought back to me my running, I decided to investigate this advice of Esselstyn regarding coffee. 

This morning I am drinking decaf. I will not go religiously not a drop of caffeine this time. I do not pursue perfection. I may drink black tea although I do not think I like it honestly. But actually, since I started high energy and heart supporting way of eating I also had been noticing that I am “forgetting” about my cold cup of coffee or making only one sip of it and not having the rest. I also do not fall asleep as fast I used to when I was on decaf. 

So here I am going to challenge caffeine again. Now I am much stronger and let’s see if all my strength is just a result of coffee or it is actually my new way of feeding myself. ",0,1751722997.0,decaf,0,0.5,False

1lsa2ww,https://youtu.be/W9QZzm6KScg,4 Very Scary TRUE Off-Grid Living Horror Stories,"# ""The Cabin in the Foothills: Some Places Are Meant to Be Left Alone"":

I always thought living off the grid would be the ultimate freedom. No more city noise, no more traffic, just me and nature. I found a small cabin in the foothills of the mountains, about a mile outside of town. It was perfect—secluded, surrounded by trees, and far enough from civilization to give me the peace I craved.

I moved in during the spring, eager to start my new life. The first few weeks were blissful. I hiked the trails, fished in the nearby stream, and even tried my hand at growing some vegetables. The quiet was soothing, and I felt like I was finally free. But as the days turned into weeks, I started to notice things that made me uneasy.

It began with small signs—footprints that weren’t mine, branches broken in a way that suggested someone had passed through recently. I told myself it was just hikers or hunters passing by. After all, the mountains were vast, and I wasn’t the only one who loved the wilderness. But then, one day, while exploring further up the mountain, I stumbled upon something that chilled me to the bone.

Tucked away in a clearing, half-buried under leaves and dirt, was a structure. It looked like an old altar, made of stones stacked carefully on top of each other. In the center was a flat rock, stained with what looked like old, dried blood. Around it were scattered bones—animal bones, I hoped. The air felt heavy, oppressive, as if the place itself was warning me to leave. I pulled out my phone and snapped a few photos, my hands trembling slightly. Curiosity mixed with dread, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t supposed to be there.

As I turned to leave, I froze. Two figures stood at the edge of the clearing, watching me. They were tall, unnaturally so, with pale faces that seemed to glow in the dim light filtering through the trees. Their clothes were strange—not modern, more like something from another era, tattered and mismatched. They stood motionless, staring, one of them pointing directly at me.

My heart pounded in my chest. I didn’t wait to see what they wanted. I ran, crashing through the underbrush, branches scratching at my arms. I didn’t care about the direction; I just needed to get away. The forest seemed to close in around me, the trees looming like silent witnesses. I ran for what felt like miles, my lungs burning, my legs aching, until I finally burst out of the trees near my cabin. I fumbled with my keys, unlocked the door, and slammed it shut behind me, locking it tight. I leaned against the door, panting, trying to make sense of what I’d seen. Were they real? Or was my mind playing tricks on me?

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the cabin, every rustle outside, made me jump. I kept picturing those pale faces, their eyes fixed on me, their pointing fingers. I told myself it was just a one-time thing, maybe some eccentric locals or lost travelers. But deep down, I wasn’t so sure.

The next morning, I decided to go into town to see if anyone knew anything about the area. I stopped at the local diner, where a few old-timers sat sipping coffee. I approached one of them, a grizzled man with a weathered face, and cleared my throat.

“Excuse me,” I said, “I’m living in the old cabin up the mountain. Do you know anything about the history of that area?”

He looked at me, his eyes narrowing. “That cabin, huh? You know, folks around here don’t go up there much. There’s stories, you see.”

“What kind of stories?” I asked, my stomach tightening.

“Well, back in the day, there was a group that lived up there, some kind of cult, I think. They had their own ways, didn’t mix with the townsfolk. Then, one day, they just disappeared. No one knows what happened to them, but there’s been talk of strange things up there ever since.”

“Like what?” I pressed, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Lights in the woods, weird noises, people feeling like they’re being watched. Some say the place is cursed.” He took a sip of his coffee, his eyes never leaving mine. “If I were you, I’d be careful up there.”

I thanked him and left, his words echoing in my mind. A cult? Disappeared? That could explain the altar I found, but it only made me more uneasy. I drove back to the cabin, my mind racing. Was I living on land with a dark past? Were those figures connected to it?

Back at the cabin, I tried to shake off the unease, but it clung to me like damp air. That night, I set up trail cameras around the property, hoping to catch whoever—or whatever—was out there. I checked them the next morning, my heart sinking as I reviewed the footage. It showed two figures moving through the trees at night, their faces obscured, but their movements deliberate, as if they were searching for something. Or someone.

I couldn’t just sit there and wait for something to happen. I grabbed my bear spray and hunting knife and headed back to the clearing. If I could understand what that altar was, maybe I could make sense of everything. As I approached, I heard voices—low, murmuring, in a language I didn’t recognize. I hid behind a tree and peeked out. There they were, the two figures, standing by the altar, performing some kind of ritual. They were chanting, their voices rising and falling in a hypnotic rhythm, their hands moving over the stained rock.

I must have stepped on a twig because the chanting stopped abruptly. They turned toward me, their pale faces locking onto mine. My blood ran cold. I bolted, running faster than I ever had, but this time, they gave chase. I could hear their footsteps pounding behind me, their breathing heavy and ragged. They were fast, too fast, and they were gaining on me.

I dodged trees, leapt over logs, my heart hammering in my chest. The forest seemed to stretch on forever, but finally, I saw my cabin in the distance. I sprinted toward it, fumbling for my keys. My hands shook as I unlocked the door, slipped inside, and slammed it shut, locking it just as I heard their footsteps reach the porch.

I pressed myself against the door, holding my breath, listening to their heavy steps on the wooden boards. They murmured to each other, their voices low and angry, like they were arguing about what to do next. I gripped my knife, ready to defend myself, but after what felt like hours, the footsteps faded, and the night grew quiet again.

I didn’t sleep that night, or the next. I boarded up the windows, set up more cameras, and kept my bear spray by my side at all times. But the incidents didn’t stop. One night, I woke to the sound of someone trying to open my garage door. I grabbed my flashlight and peered out the window. A man stood there, dressed in dark clothes, his face hidden by a hood, prying at the lock with a tool. I shouted, “Get out of here!” and he froze, then bolted into the darkness.

A few days later, while checking my traps, I saw two men in camouflage, carrying binoculars, watching me from a ridge. When they noticed me looking, they started walking toward me, their movements purposeful. One of them had a rifle slung over his shoulder.

“What do you want?” I called out, trying to sound braver than I felt.

They didn’t answer, just kept coming. I backed away, my hand on the bear spray. When they were about twenty feet away, the one with the rifle raised it, pointing it at me. My heart stopped. I sprayed the bear spray in their direction, and they coughed and stumbled back, cursing under their breath. I ran back to the cabin, locking myself inside, my hands shaking so badly I could barely turn the key.

This couldn’t go on. I was living in constant fear, always looking over my shoulder, jumping at every sound. I decided to leave, to go back to the city where I’d be safe. But as I was packing my things, I heard a knock on the door. I froze, my heart racing. I peered through a gap in the boarded-up window and saw a police car parked outside.

I opened the door cautiously. “Sir, we’ve had reports of strange activity in this area,” the officer said, his voice calm but serious. “We’re just checking on residents to make sure everything’s okay.”

I spilled everything—the altar, the figures, the men in camo, the nighttime intruder. He listened, jotting notes in a small pad, but I could see the skepticism in his eyes. “Look, I know it sounds crazy,” I said, my voice shaking, “but I think there’s something dangerous going on here.”

“We’ll look into it,” he promised, but his tone suggested he didn’t fully believe me. After he left, I finished packing and loaded my car. As I drove away, I glanced back at the cabin, half-expecting to see those pale faces watching me from the trees. The road stretched out before me, leading back to the city, but the fear stayed with me, a heavy weight I couldn’t shake.

I never returned. I sold the cabin to a developer, who probably tore it down and built something else. I don’t know, and I don’t care. All I know is that some places are better left alone, and some secrets are better left buried.





# ""Kindness Turned to Horror"":

I never thought a simple road trip would turn into the worst day of my life. My boyfriend and I had been together for over four years, and we were so in love. We were both students, excited about our future together, dreaming of marriage and kids someday. Before the new semester started, we decided to take a spontaneous trip to Cheaha State Park in Alabama. We loved hiking and exploring nature, and the idea of seeing the waterfalls sounded like the perfect way to end the summer.

That Sunday morning, August 14, 2022, we drove through the Talladega National Forest, the beauty of the place taking my breath away. The trees stretched high, their leaves forming a green canopy above the winding road. The air smelled of pine and earth, fresh and clean. My boyfriend was humming along to our favorite song on the radio, his hand resting on mine. “This is going to be a great day,” he said, smiling at me. I nodded, feeling so happy to be with him.

We were driving along a quiet National Forest Service road when I noticed a woman standing next to a car with its hood up. She looked distressed, waving her arms to get our attention. “Looks like she needs help,” my boyfriend said, slowing down and pulling over. He was always the first to offer a hand, his kind heart one of the things I loved most about him.

We got out of the car, and the woman approached us. Her clothes were worn, her face tired, like she hadn’t slept in days. “Thank you so much for stopping,” she said, her voice shaky. “My car won’t start, and I’m stuck out here. Can you help?”

“No problem,” my boyfriend replied, grabbing the jumper cables from our trunk. “Let’s take a look.”

For the next half hour, we tried to jump-start her car. My boyfriend checked the battery, fiddled with the cables, and even looked under the hood for other issues. Nothing worked. I stood nearby, watching, but a strange feeling crept over me. The woman kept glancing around, her eyes darting to the trees. I followed her gaze and thought I saw movement in the woods—a shadow, maybe a person, standing just out of sight. When I looked again, it was gone. I told myself it was nothing, just my imagination playing tricks in this remote place.

But the unease didn’t go away. The woman’s nervous glances, the silence of the forest—it all felt wrong. “Maybe we should call for roadside assistance,” I suggested, trying to keep my voice steady.

Before my boyfriend could answer, the woman stepped back and pulled a gun from her jacket. My heart stopped. The air seemed to freeze around us. “Drop your phones, wallets, everything,” she ordered, her voice now cold and hard. “And start walking into the woods.”

I couldn’t move, my legs like lead. My boyfriend stepped in front of me, his body shielding mine. “What do you want?” he asked, his voice calm but firm.

“Just do as I say,” she snapped, waving the gun. “Now!”

We had no choice. We dropped our phones and keys on the ground and started walking into the forest, her footsteps crunching behind us. My mind raced, panic clawing at my chest. How could this be happening? We were just trying to help. The trees closed in around us, the forest swallowing us whole. I glanced at my boyfriend, his jaw tight, his eyes scanning for a way out.

“What’s going on?” I whispered to him, my voice trembling.

“Stay close,” he whispered back. “I’ve got you.”

After what felt like forever, she told us to stop. “Empty your pockets,” she demanded, her gun still pointed at us. My hands shook as I pulled out a few dollars and a lip balm, dropping them on the ground. That’s when my boyfriend made his move. He had a concealed carry permit and always carried a handgun for safety. In one swift motion, he pulled it out and pointed it at her.

“Drop the gun!” he shouted.

For a moment, everything was still. The woman’s eyes widened, and she fumbled with her gun. I heard a click—her gun had jammed. She cursed, trying to fix it, but my boyfriend didn’t wait. Shots rang out, loud and sharp, echoing through the trees. I saw her stumble back, hit by his bullets, but then she fired, too. One shot. That’s all it took.

My boyfriend fell to the ground, clutching his chest. I screamed, the sound tearing from my throat. The woman collapsed, too, blood seeping from her wounds. I ran to my boyfriend, dropping to my knees beside him. “No, no, no!” I cried, tears streaming down my face. “Please, stay with me!”

Blood soaked his shirt, and his breathing was shallow. I pressed my hands to his chest, trying to stop the bleeding, but it was so much. I remembered my first aid training and started CPR, pushing on his chest, counting the compressions. “Come on, you can’t leave me,” I sobbed.

With one hand, I grabbed my phone from the ground and dialed 911. “My boyfriend’s been shot!” I cried when the operator answered. “We’re in Cheaha State Park, on a forest service road. Please, send help!”

“Stay calm,” the operator said. “Can you tell me exactly where you are?”

I tried to explain, my voice shaking as I kept doing CPR. The operator stayed on the line, guiding me, but every second felt like an hour. The woman lay nearby, groaning in pain, and I was terrified she might get up. Worse, I kept hearing rustles in the woods, like someone else was out there, watching. My heart pounded, fear gripping me as I worked to save my boyfriend.

“Please, hurry,” I begged the operator. “I don’t know if someone else is coming.”

The wait was agonizing. I kept pressing on his chest, willing him to hold on, but his face was so pale. I talked to him, telling him I loved him, that we had so much left to do together. But deep down, I knew. I could feel him slipping away.

When the paramedics finally arrived, they took over, but it was too late. He was gone. I collapsed, sobbing, the world blurring around me. The police came, and I learned there was another woman involved, hiding in the woods, part of the plan. They found her later at a camp where they’d been living off the grid.

The days after were a haze. I went back to Florida, surrounded by family, but the pain was unbearable. He was my everything, my hero. He saved my life that day, and I’ll never forget it. But the cost was too high.

This changed me forever. I used to believe in helping others, in kindness. Now, I see danger everywhere. The world feels darker, and I’m scared it always will. I miss him every day, and I wish we could have had the future we dreamed of. But I know he’d want me to keep going, so I’m trying, one day at a time, to honor his memory.





# ""The Night the Bear Tried to Break In"":

I always wanted to live close to nature, free from the noise and stress of city life. That’s why I moved to a remote part of Alaska, setting up a yurt as my home. It was a simple structure, round and sturdy, with canvas walls and a wooden frame. I loved the idea of being self-sufficient, relying on solar panels for power, collecting rainwater, and growing my own vegetables in a small garden. The wilderness around me was breathtaking—towering trees, distant mountains, and a quiet that felt like a warm blanket. But I knew living off-grid came with risks, especially in bear country.

The first few months were peaceful. I’d wake up to birds singing, spend my days tending the garden, and fall asleep to the sound of crickets. I saw deer and rabbits often, their gentle movements a reminder of why I chose this life. But I was always aware of bears. Before moving, I read everything I could about them. Black bears roamed these woods, and they could be curious, especially if they smelled food. I took precautions: stored my food in airtight containers, secured my trash in a metal bin, and carried bear spray whenever I left the yurt. I even bought a small radio to play at night, hoping human voices would keep wildlife away.

One morning, I noticed something unsettling. Near my garden, the dirt was scratched up, with deep claw marks on a nearby tree. My stomach tightened. “Just a bear passing through,” I told myself, trying to stay calm. I checked my food storage and trash bin, making sure everything was secure. “You’ve got this, Jamie,” I said out loud, my voice echoing in the quiet. I decided to be extra careful, making more noise when I worked outside, banging a spoon against a pot now and then to scare off any curious animals.

A few days later, I found my trash bin tipped over, the contents scattered across the ground. “Darn it,” I muttered, picking up the mess. The bin was heavy, and the latch was still locked, but something strong had knocked it over. I knew it was a bear. I reinforced the bin with extra straps and started checking the area daily for signs of trouble. I found more tracks, bigger this time, circling closer to the yurt. At night, I’d lie awake, listening for any sound that didn’t belong. Once, I heard heavy footsteps outside, like something big was pacing. I held my breath, clutching my bear spray, but the noise faded. “You’re okay,” I whispered to myself, though my heart was racing.

I decided to talk to a neighbor, an older man named Tom who lived a few miles away in his own off-grid cabin. I hiked over one afternoon, hoping for advice. “Seen any bears around?” I asked, sitting on his porch. Tom leaned back in his chair, scratching his beard. “Oh, sure,” he said. “Black bears are curious. Had one try to get into my shed last year. Scared it off with a loud horn and some banging. Keep your food locked up tight, and don’t leave anything out. They’ll move on if there’s nothing to eat.” I nodded, grateful for the advice. “Thanks, Tom. I’ll keep that in mind.” He smiled. “You’ll be fine, kid. Just stay smart.”

Back at the yurt, I installed motion-activated lights and a simple alarm system that would buzz if something big crossed the perimeter. I felt a bit safer, but the unease lingered. The claw marks, the tracks, the tipped-over bin—they were reminders that I wasn’t alone out here. I started keeping a journal, writing down every strange sign I saw, trying to make sense of it. “Day 92,” I wrote one night. “More tracks today. Bear’s getting bolder. I’m ready, but I’m scared.”

One evening, as I was cooking dinner on my small propane stove, I heard a loud crash outside. My heart jumped. I grabbed my flashlight and bear spray, my hands shaking. “Stay calm,” I told myself, stepping outside. The beam of light swept across the yard, landing on the storage shed. The door was ajar, and something was moving inside. “Hey!” I shouted, my voice cracking. “Get out of there!” A large shape froze, then turned toward me. It was a black bear, its eyes glinting in the light. My pulse pounded as I raised my bear spray. “Go on, get!” I yelled, banging the flashlight against the yurt’s frame. The bear huffed, then lumbered off into the trees. I stood there, breathing hard, watching until it was gone.

I thought that was the worst of it. I was wrong.

A week later, I woke up in the middle of the night to a sound that made my blood run cold. It was a loud, rhythmic scratching, like claws dragging across fabric. It was coming from the side of the yurt. I sat up, my heart hammering so loud I could hear it. The scratching grew louder, more insistent, and I realized the bear was trying to get inside. I grabbed my flashlight and bear spray, my hands trembling so badly I nearly dropped them. “Stay calm, Jamie,” I whispered, but my voice was shaking.

I crept toward the wall, shining the flashlight through the small window. The beam caught the bear’s massive shape, its paws clawing at the canvas. The fabric was starting to tear, a jagged rip forming under its claws. “No, no, no,” I muttered, panic rising. I had to act fast. I grabbed a pot and a spoon and started banging them together as hard as I could. “Get out of here!” I screamed, my voice raw. The bear paused, its head turning toward the noise, but it didn’t leave.

I turned on the radio, cranking the volume to blast a talk show into the night. The voices echoed, but the bear kept clawing. The rip was getting bigger, and I could see its snout pushing through. “You’re not getting in!” I shouted, grabbing the bear spray. I aimed at the tear and sprayed, the mist hissing out. The bear roared, a deep, angry sound that made my knees weak. It shook its head, backing away, but it didn’t run.

I kept banging the pot, screaming, and spraying until the can was empty. The bear growled, pacing outside, its shadow moving across the yurt’s walls. I grabbed a roll of duct tape and frantically patched the tear, my hands slipping as I worked. “Please, just go,” I whispered, tears stinging my eyes. The bear circled the yurt, its heavy steps crunching on the ground. I stood frozen, listening, praying it would leave.

After what felt like forever, the noises stopped. I waited, holding my breath, until I was sure it was gone. I sank to the floor, my body shaking, the flashlight still clutched in my hand. I didn’t sleep that night, too afraid to close my eyes.

The next morning, I inspected the yurt. The tear was bad, but I could fix it. I spent the day reinforcing the walls with extra canvas and wooden panels, my hands still trembling from the night before. I built a bear-proof storage box for my food and trash, using heavy-duty metal and a lock. I also ordered an electric fence to put around the yurt, something Tom had mentioned some folks used.

Living off-grid is everything I dreamed it would be—beautiful, freeing, and wild. But that night taught me how real the dangers are. I still love this life, but I know now that I’m not just living with nature—I’m living with its risks. I’m more prepared now, and I won’t let one bear drive me away. This is my home, and I’m staying.





# ""Buried Silence: The Kill Kit in the Woods"":

I always wanted a life away from the city’s noise and rush. That’s why I moved to a small cabin deep in the forests of Washington state. It’s surrounded by tall pines, with a creek nearby that hums softly at night. I grow my own vegetables, collect rainwater, and power my cabin with solar panels. The nearest town is an hour’s drive, and I like it that way. The solitude feels like freedom. For a year, it was perfect—until the day I found something that turned my sanctuary into a place of fear.

It was a crisp morning, and I was out gathering firewood about a hundred yards from my cabin. My axe was slung over my shoulder, and I was scanning the ground for fallen branches when I noticed a patch of earth that looked wrong. The dirt was loose, like someone had dug it up and tried to cover their tracks. My curiosity got the better of me. I grabbed my shovel from the shed and started digging.

After a few minutes, my shovel hit something hard. I brushed away the dirt and found a metal box, about the size of a suitcase, rusted at the edges. My hands shook as I pried it open. Inside was a handgun, a box of ammunition, a roll of duct tape, a bundle of zip ties, a hunting knife, and a folded map. The map had red X’s marked at various spots, one of them uncomfortably close to my cabin. There was also a small notebook with dates and short, cryptic notes like “observe patterns” and “no witnesses.”

At first, I thought it might be a hunter’s stash, but the combination of items felt wrong. Then I remembered a news report I’d heard in town about serial killers who bury “kill kits” in remote areas to use later. My heart started pounding. Was the person who buried this still around? Were they watching me right now?

I slammed the box shut and looked around, the forest suddenly feeling too quiet. The trees seemed to loom closer, their shadows hiding who-knows-what. I carried the box back to my cabin, my eyes darting to every rustle in the bushes. I locked the door behind me, something I rarely bothered to do out here.

Living off-grid means no phone line, and my cell gets no signal this far out. The nearest place to make a call was the general store in town. I loaded the box into my truck and drove as fast as the winding dirt roads allowed. At the store, I used the payphone to call the sheriff’s office.

“Hello, sheriff’s department,” a calm voice answered.

“Hi, I found something strange on my property,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “A metal box buried in the ground. It’s got a gun, zip ties, duct tape, a knife, and a map with marked locations. I think it might be dangerous.”

The deputy asked for my location and details about the box. “That sounds serious,” he said. “We’ll send someone out to take a look, but it might take a couple of hours to get to you. You’re pretty far out. Can you keep the box secure and not touch anything inside?”

“Yeah, I can do that,” I said. “Should I stay in town?”

“If you feel safe going back, that’s fine,” he replied. “Just lock it up and keep an eye out. We’ll be there as soon as we can.”

I hung up, my stomach twisting. I didn’t want to go back, but I couldn’t leave my cabin unprotected. I drove home, the box sitting like a silent threat in the passenger seat. When I got to the cabin, I locked the doors and windows, then hid the box in a closet under some blankets. I tried to go about my day, but every creak of the cabin made me jump.

As evening fell, the forest grew darker, and my unease grew with it. I kept my hunting rifle close, checking the windows every few minutes. The silence was heavy, broken only by the occasional hoot of an owl or rustle of leaves. I told myself it was just the forest, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone.

Around nine, I called my friend Emma from the satellite phone I keep for emergencies. It’s spotty, but it works sometimes.

“Emma, I found something weird today,” I said when she picked up.

“What kind of weird?” she asked, her voice crackling through the static.

“A box buried near my cabin. It had a gun, zip ties, all sorts of creepy stuff. I called the sheriff, but they won’t be here for a while.”

“That’s freaky,” she said. “You sure you’re okay out there? Maybe you should come to town until they figure it out.”

“I can’t just leave,” I said. “What if someone comes looking for it? I’ve got it locked up, and I’m keeping my rifle handy.”

“Be careful,” she said. “If you hear anything strange, get out of there. Promise me.”

“I will,” I said, but I wasn’t sure I meant it. This was my home, and I wasn’t going to let some creep drive me out.

After we hung up, I sat in the dark, the only light coming from a small lantern. I didn’t want to draw attention by turning on the solar-powered lights. Every sound outside felt like a threat—the wind, a branch snapping, an animal scurrying. I gripped my rifle, my palms sweaty.

Around midnight, I heard it: a distinct *snap* of a twig just outside the cabin. My heart leapt into my throat. I crept to the window and peered out, my flashlight off to avoid giving away my position. I couldn’t see anything, but the hairs on my neck stood up. Someone was out there.

I checked the locks again, my hands trembling. Then I heard footsteps on the porch, slow and deliberate. The door handle jiggled, and I froze, my breath caught in my chest. Another jiggle, then a loud *bang* as someone slammed against the door.

“Who’s there?” I shouted, my voice shaking. “I have a gun!”

The banging stopped. Silence stretched on, thick and heavy. Then a voice, low and rough, came through the door. “Give me back what’s mine, and I’ll leave you alone.”

My blood ran cold. It was him—the person who buried the box. I tightened my grip on the rifle. “The police are on their way,” I said, trying to sound braver than I felt. “You should leave now.”

A pause, then the voice again, colder this time. “I don’t think so. I think you’re bluffing.”

Another *bang*, harder this time. The door started to splinter at the edges. My mind raced. I couldn’t wait for him to break in. I aimed my rifle at the top of the door, where I knew he couldn’t be standing, and fired a warning shot. The blast echoed in the small cabin, deafening me for a moment.

There was a yell from outside, followed by the sound of footsteps running off the porch. I held my breath, listening. The forest was quiet again, but I didn’t dare move. I kept the rifle aimed at the door, my heart pounding so loud I thought it might give me away.

Minutes passed, then hours. I didn’t sleep, didn’t move, just sat there with my rifle, waiting for dawn. When the first light of morning crept through the windows, I finally worked up the courage to check outside. The porch was empty, but there were fresh footprints in the dirt, leading away into the woods.

I barricaded the door with a heavy table and waited. Around mid-morning, I heard the rumble of a vehicle. I peeked out and saw a sheriff’s truck pulling up. Relief washed over me, but my hands were still shaking as I opened the door.

The deputy, a tall man with a serious face, stepped inside. “You okay?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I said, my voice hoarse. “He was here last night. Tried to break in.”

I showed him the box and told him everything. He examined the contents, his expression growing grim. “This is bad,” he said. “We’ve seen stuff like this before. Could be linked to some serious crimes.”

He took the box and my statement, promising to send more officers to patrol the area. A few days later, he called me at the general store. They’d caught a man matching my description, a known criminal with a history of violence. They found evidence in his truck linking him to several unsolved murders in the region.

I went back to my cabin, but it didn’t feel the same. The peace I’d loved was tainted by the memory of that voice, those footsteps. I started locking my doors every night, keeping my rifle closer than ever. I still love my off-grid life, but I know now that even in the middle of nowhere, danger can find you.",1,1751722642.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1lsa2gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lsa2gn/explore_the_bella_35206_coffee_maker_review_is_it/,Explore the bella 35206 Coffee Maker Review Is It Worth the Hype?,"Testing out the bella 35206 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker has been an interesting ride. It’s hard not to notice how sleek this coffee machine looks, with its seaglass matte finish making it a great addition to any modern kitchen. I’ve been using it daily for my morning coffee routine, and as a coffee enthusiast, I can confidently say that this gadget offers a delightful balance of function and aesthetics. The machine feels lightweight at just 2.69 pounds, and its compact design means it fits snugly on my countertop—no awkward readjustments required.

**User-Friendly Design**

The standout feature for me is the easy-to-read digital display panel. It’s intuitive and doesn’t require guessing which button does what. The programmable functionality has been a game-changer for busy mornings—I can set it up to brew a fresh pot of coffee up to 24 hours in advance. It’s like waking up to your personal barista. The anti-drip carafe spout is another thoughtful touch. There’s no mess when pouring, which is perfect because cleaning coffee spills first thing in the morning is no one’s idea of fun.

[Check bella 35206 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dpnkhtrk/)  

**Performance That Delivers**

With a 900-watt brewing system, this coffee maker gets more than warm—it gets the job done fast. The adjustable brew strength setting accommodates both mild and strong coffee lovers alike. Over the past week, I’ve alternated between a light morning brew and the robust kickstart I need on busier days. The non-stick warming plate ensures the coffee stays hot for hours, which is perfect if you’ve got people over or enjoy leisurely sipping throughout the morning.  

**Advantages**

- Programmable brewing up to 24 hours in advance.  
- Lightweight and compact design, ideal for smaller kitchens.  
- Anti-drip spout that keeps countertops spotless.  
- Reusable filter basket and included measuring scoop for eco-conscious coffee lovers.  

**Drawbacks**

- Like most drip coffee makers, the machine can make a bit of noise during brewing.  
- The matte finish, although beautiful, is prone to showing fingerprints and requires regular cleaning to maintain its pristine look.  

**Competing Products**

When considering similarly priced coffee makers, the bella 35206 holds its own quite well. Compared to the Cuisinart DCC-450BK, which offers a similar programmable feature set, the bella machine wins on design and weight. However, its smaller size might not appeal to households needing to brew large quantities throughout the day. On the higher-end side, brands like Breville or Technivorm offer more premium models with advanced features like precise temperature control. But for most users, the bella coffee maker’s easy functionality and efficient programming will cover all the essentials.

**Bang for the Buck**  

Given its array of features, the bella 35206 offers excellent value. If you’re someone who prioritizes convenience and wants a reliable coffee maker on a budget, this one checks all the boxes. The reusable filter basket saves money on disposable filters while being environmentally conscious—a significant bonus in today’s world. Its intuitive design ensures that you get practical functionality without the learning curve of more complicated gadgets.

Recently, both the 1-cup and 2-cup buttons stopped working properly.

When I press either button, the machine tries to start but immediately stops, no extraction happens. The same thing happens when I press the steam button: it cuts off right away.

I initially thought we had accidentally changed the volume settings, so I tried the factory reset procedure (holding both the 1-cup and 2-cup buttons, etc), but it didn’t resolve the issue. I also attempted the manual volume setup, but that fails too, the machine stops after one second and doesn’t let me set anything.

I contacted Breville support and they’re asking me to ship the unit to them. The process seems lengthy, and the cost will only be provided once they inspect the machine.

Before I go that route, I wanted to ask if anyone here has experienced a similar issue or has any suggestions for a potential fix I could try at home.

1ls9yvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureFunded/comments/1ls9yvb/why_should_i_start_investing/,Why should I start investing?,"**Why should I start investing?**

So you’re wondering if investing is really worth it? Let me break it down in a way that’s simple, real, and hopefully motivating.


“It’s just a coffee…”
The average coffee costs around $5.
That’s $5 x 30 days = $150/month.

Now imagine investing that $150/month instead of spending it. Over 10, 20, 30 years — with the power of compound interest — you’re not just saving money. You’re building wealth.

**Loss of Purchasing Power**

Inflation eats away your money every year. What £100 (or $100) could buy 10 years ago? It can’t buy today.

Leaving money sitting in a savings account earning near-zero interest is basically guaranteeing a loss in value.

Investing helps protect and grow your money over time — helping you stay ahead of inflation.

**Peace of Mind**

Ever worry about what happens if you lose your job? Or how you’ll afford a home, a kid, or even retirement?

Investing gives you a plan. A backup fund. A growing pot of money that works for you in the background. Peace of mind isn’t just nice — it’s freedom.

**Retirement Plan (Start Early)**

The earlier you start, the less you need to invest overall thanks to compound growth. Waiting until 40 means you have to invest way more than if you start at 20 or 25.

Don’t rely on the government or your employer to take care of your future. Take control.

**Compound Interest = Magic**

Put simply: your money earns money. Then that money earns more money.

Example:

Invest $150/month with a 7% return =

• ~$18,500 after 10 years

• ~$61,500 after 20 years

• ~$150,000+ after 30 years

That’s just your coffee money. Imagine doing more.

**Passive Income**

Eventually, your investments can pay you. Through dividends, interest, and growth, your portfolio can become a stream of income — even if you don’t lift a finger.

That’s how people retire early. Or buy homes. Or travel the world. It’s not luck — it’s long-term planning.

**TL;DR**
	
•	Stop trading time for every pound/dollar you earn
	
•	Start investing, even small amounts
	
•	Protect your money from inflation
	
•	Enjoy peace of mind
	
•	Plan for your future self
	
•	Let compound interest work its magic
	
•	Turn your spending habits into financial freedom


If you’re 10+ years from retirement, the best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is now.

Got questions? Let’s talk.

Future Funded. Invest in your future, one pound at a time.

1ls9y38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIAssisted/comments/1ls9y38/prompts_as_thoughtforms_beyond_commands_and/,# Prompts as Thoughtforms: Beyond Commands and Control,"Most of us treat prompts like we’re programming a microwave: precise instructions in, predictable output out. But what if we’re missing something fundamental about how communication actually works?

## The Shift from Commands to Communication

Here’s what I’ve noticed: the most effective prompts don’t feel like instructions at all. They feel like… invitations. They create a space where something interesting can emerge.

Think about it this way: when you’re having a great conversation with someone creative, you don’t hand them a checklist. You share a vision, set a mood, point toward something intriguing. You create what I call a **thoughtform** - a concentrated bundle of intent and context that the other person can run with.

## What Makes a Thoughtform Different?

A traditional prompt says: “Write a blog post about X with Y structure and Z tone.”

A thoughtform says: “Imagine you’re explaining this fascinating discovery to a curious friend over coffee. You’re excited because you just realized something that connects three different ideas you’ve been thinking about.”

The difference?

- **Commands** try to control the output
- **Thoughtforms** shape the creative space

## The Semantic Field Effect

When you craft a prompt as a thoughtform, you’re not just providing information - you’re creating what I call a semantic field. You’re establishing:

- The emotional context (“excited discovery”)
- The relationship dynamic (“explaining to a friend”)
- The setting (“over coffee”)
- The intellectual framework (“connecting three ideas”)

This gives the AI (or person) a rich context to work within, rather than a rigid template to follow.

## Practical Examples

**Instead of:**

> “Write a 500-word article about renewable energy with an optimistic tone, including statistics and a call to action.”

**Try:**

> “You’re a climate scientist who just got back from a conference where you saw three breakthrough technologies that made you genuinely hopeful for the first time in years. Write like you’re sharing this excitement with someone who cares about the future but feels overwhelmed by climate news.”

**Instead of:**

> “Create a product description for this app that highlights its key features.”

**Try:**

> “You’ve been using this app for months and it’s quietly made your life better in ways you didn’t expect. Write like you’re recommending it to a friend who struggles with the same problems you used to have.”

## Why This Matters

When we shift from commanding to communing, several things happen:

1. **Creativity flourishes** - The AI has room to surprise you
1. **Authenticity emerges** - The output feels more natural and engaging
1. **Collaboration begins** - You’re working together, not just giving orders
1. **Results improve** - The content resonates because it has genuine context

## The Bigger Picture

This isn’t just about AI interaction. It’s about how we communicate, period. The most inspiring leaders, teachers, and collaborators don’t just give instructions - they create fields of possibility that others can step into.

We’re not just typing commands. We’re casting ideas into the world and seeing what grows.

Using MJ isn't a quick fix for me. I’m in this for the long haul. After years of diets, losing weight, then only to put it all back, I see MJ as a last resort. I’m using MJ as a tool to lose weight and develop healthy eating habits for the rest of my life.

I’m eating less processed foods and exercising more by commuting by bike to work. I also avoid fast food, takeaways, and flavoured coffees, not only because I need to cut them out but also because I don’t have cravings for them.  The food that I eat is in smaller portions. I surprised myself in the beginning by pushing away an unfinished plate, something a rarely did.

Your MJ journey is about caring about yourself; ignore the bad press. Using MJ is not cheating; we can all testify to that.

Negative comments from friends are unacceptable. If they can't offer something positive, they're not true friends. I refuse to be held hostage by anyone's negativity.

If it is a choice between using MJ and a life plagued by worsening health problems, I know what my choice would be every single time.",7,1751722223.0,mounjarouk,0,1.0,False

Entertainment

Frida on Sorrow, Gossip, Pride and the new Record

No pain can be stronger than the breakup of a person you have been so close to for so many years.

 

Frida's solo LP has just been released worldwide.

 

While ABBA is on a low during Benny's paternity leave, it's Frida, 36, who is focusing on a big career of her own.

Here she talks candidly about what she wants right now. About Sorrow, Pride, Gossip and of course - the new album.

“I'm too shy to go out to a restaurant alone”

On the way to Polar's office at Norrmalmstorg in Stockholm, you must push your way between appeal meetings and nervous politicians who try to sound experienced and unfazed but look like animals that have been released from a protected zoo. When I talk to Frida later, I say something about politics, and she says:

\- Ugh, yes, I don't trust politicians anymore. I listened to Palme and Fälldin on TV and burst out laughing. It was almost just a verbal battle.

But Fälldin did a good job. He is charming and dares to stand and sweat and be a little unsure and say the wrong thing and get angry. He is incredibly human, while I think Palme is terribly cold.

Polar's office has been newly decorated in a discreet white color. The corridors are full of people with computer lists. In the toilet, Affärsvärlden and Veckans Affärer are in the way that Kalle Anka or Hänt i veckan are in others.

Frida is sitting in the coffee room. She is dressed in black. Discreet black. Not trendy and challenging black. She shows where the coffee and coffee cups are and I say:

On your new LP, I think you can hear greater sadness and greater pride in your voice than before. Could that be so?

Yes, that's probably true. It has to do with my maturity. Nothing that hasn't hit my heart right away has been included. I feel proud and have a great sadness deep down to take away.

She talks about her divorce from Benny:

When you go through such pain as a breakup with someone you've been very close to for so many years, you hit rock bottom. It hits you terribly hard and you lose your footing for a period of time.

There can't be a pain that's stronger. Nothing feels more digusting than that. That's why it can only get better, only more positive. A year and a half have passed, and I think it's been progressing all the time for me.

She speaks with a fragile and reserved voice. Far from the one you find on records and hear on radio and TV. She starts each sentence by sinking into herself, and when she answers, it's as if she's thought out exactly what she's going to say.

We talk about her upbringing in Torshälla with her grandmother and end up saying that she now buys clothes for 10,000 kronor a month to compensate for her poor childhood.

10,000 a month - that's not wise, she says.

My grandmother worked as a cleaner, seamstress and dishwasher - you know, everything that was possible to get. We had money for food - that was pretty much everything.

How has it affected you?

I learned early on to take care of myself. That was probably the positive thing. But it also gave me an inherent uncertainty that has haunted me through the years. Until a couple of years ago. A certain kind of insecurity, maybe.

How did you get over it?

With the breakup with Benny, I found myself in a completely new situation. I had to stand on my own two feet, take care of myself, my life and my children. And when you feel like you're fixing things, you become stronger. I didn't have to go to professional therapy, but I had good friends, and I probably went to therapy with them instead.

I've had friends who were fantastic for me. You need that in crisis situations.

She says she finds it really boring to live alone - when you don't choose your loneliness yourself.

But my children have lived with me for the last six years. Although right now my 16-year-old daughter Lotta is in the USA to go to high school for a year. She lives with a Jewish family in Rochester, New York State. I would have liked to do that too when I was her age.

There's a debate going on right now about gossip and lies in women's magazines. Agnetha Fältskog and Anders Wall have finally sued them. How do you feel about gossip about private life?

 

Agnetha and I have a very deep connection

 

I have also been affected, although more superficially. But for Agnetha it has been worse. Her entire integrity has been threatened. What they did was really upsetting. It was completely right of her to come out like this, I think.

A month or so ago it was written that you had an affair with a married man.

\- Do you want me to comment on that?

No, but I wonder how you manage your private life. How you manage your integrity.

My private life is mine and it concerns no one else. It must be that way - otherwise I would probably feel very bad. This life I lived before with outsiders is a closed chapter.

I'm too shy to go out to a restaurant alone. I feel watched and become stiff. It feels like I must behave in a certain way. I want to go out with friends so that I have someone to lean on.

I'm not a bit of a sinner

When it came to ABBA, Agnetha was described as innocence and you as sin personified. Is that so?

Frida laughs and says:

What a shame... I'm not a bit of a sinner.  I'm a clean, honest and straightforward chick.

There's no sin in me.

You never show your apartment in the newspapers?

Well, that would never occur to me.

That's a shame. I would have loved to do an interview with you under the heading ""An hour in Frida's quarter"".

Hehe... well, it exploded right away.

 

Howdy, have you stopped bodybuilding now?

\-Yes. That was during an intense period when I was dancing, jogging and bodybuilding. But then I got so tired of it and stopped everything. I've only bounced on my trampoline at home once in the last year.

But I feel great anyway. I had a health check-up today and had very low and fine blood pressure.

You are moderate and admire Gösta Bohman very much. Do you admire Adelsohn just as much?

Now it turns out that Adelsohn and I hang out a bit privately, she says but quickly hastens to add:

Yes, not him and I but in company, that's all. I think he's nice. But what he's like as a politician, we don't know yet. Time will tell.

She sounds engaged when she talks about politics and suddenly the dialect from Torshälla and Eskilstuna comes through.

You met your father in 1977 after many years. Your father was a German soldier in Norway during World War II when he met your mother. Do you still meet your father?

Well, it was a very long time ago now. It felt hard to embark on a completely new family life. It felt like a strain more than something stimulating. It was like meeting any stranger - even though he was my biological father.

Why are you and the rest of ABBA so adamantly against employee funds?

\- A collective. what is it called now; collectivization of Sweden would be terrible. It will be a concentration of power that will not be good for a single person.

But it is said that no companies should be forced into the funds and that they will basically only lead to companies getting money more easily.

I don't think so at all. Quite the opposite. In the long run, the employee funds will be so strong that no companies will escape them. My son, who is 19, says he would have voted for the social security funds if it weren't for the funds.

In letters to the editor to Aftonbladet, we are often asked to ask you if you and Agnetha are friends. Are you?

Yes, absolutely. We may not hang out much, but we have a very deep connection. There is really no rivalry between us. The connection has deepened during the years we have worked together.

You are 36 years old and slowly approaching the golden age of women. Do you often look at yourself in the mirror and check if you are as beautiful as you were yesterday?

No, I never do. By the way, I just think I am getting more and more beautiful. I don't care about new wrinkles.

She laughs with the usual wrinkling of her nose and laughs again when she says that the others in ABBA like her new solo album.

\- But how honest they are - you never know.

She says that she is sorry that Mikael Wiehe did not let her record ""The Girl and the Crow"" and that a double LP will be released for Christmas with all ABBA's singles plus two new songs. ABBA is turning ten. Next fall, a new ABBA LP will be released.

Five songs have already been recorded. She takes her Marlboro pack and says that she must go because she is going to have lunch with someone half past one.

“For the rest, I just think I am getting more and more beautiful.”

The half-hour interview is over. She says: Many women only find themselves after 40.

I’m looking for someone cool to talk to, especially if you’re into games, memes, late-night convos, and maybe also trying to get back into a healthier lifestyle.

I’m a data analyst (with side quests), living in Makati and working in BGC. Not Filipino, but I’ve been here a while. I majored in three different things, not flexing, I just didn’t have much of a social life and wasn’t sure what I wanted back then.

Lately I’ve been easing back into the fit life. I started going to the gym again and eating healthier. Still a full-time coffee drinker though. I love to cook, especially chicken marinara with pasta.

Gaming is my go-to way to unwind. Recently back into Fortnite, but I also play WoW, Overwatch, Rocket League, Hearthstone, and Genshin. Ori and the Blind Forest is my comfort game.
Movie-wise, I keep going back to comfort rewatches like The Truman Show, The Big Short, Dumb and Dumber, and Spaceballs. I like movies that are either ridiculous or quietly existential.

I speak Spanish, English, and Italian. I enjoy music from classical to oldies. I’m sarcastic by nature, goofy by default, and serious when it matters. Spiritually curious, not very religious. Also a Cancer, birthday coming up soon for anyone who’s into horoscopes.

To be honest, I’m in that weird phase where I’m questioning life a bit. Not quite a midlife crisis, more like a soft existential spiral mixed with me being idiotic in overthinking everything. But hey, that’s part of the fun, right?

I come and go from this community, and I know I’ve probably left some messages hanging before. It’s never personal. Life gets overwhelming sometimes and I don’t always know how to balance it all. Still, I’m always open to meeting good people when the timing’s right.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to say hi. Just don’t judge me by my sleep schedule or tab count.",1,1751721969.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False

Then everything that happens after that happens by itself too. Laying there even.

1ls9pz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1ls9pz4/things_keep_breaking_orders_arent_coming_in_etc/,"Things Keep Breaking, Orders Aren’t Coming In, etc.","So I previously worked at a regional level (but because of what facilities I supported it was more national). Anyways we had a facility near where I lived that I supported as needed. They had someone locally in IT as well as non-IT that did the work but he left as he saw the writing on the wall. The other person (non-IT) was a sales person. She was very I know what I am doing and it is my way or the highway kind of person. She had the IT guy build the products in a way she could update them herself from the portal. Fine that worked. Now the backend was a different story. She had set stuff up but never completely. And claims she showed the warehouse how to process orders. Now I don’t know what happened but the Prez of the facility asked me to fix the mess. I did even to the point of getting approval to be on-site to deal with the issues as technical the warehouse system wasn’t part of my responsibility but I had training and experience working with it.
Anyways she must have figured out the Prez was using me to document reasons to terminate her because she quit and the warehouse girls followed suit.

That is where the shit show got worse. Apparently she was manually processing orders because the girls weren’t trained to process them and they weren’t getting the orders from the printer back by shipping. The system basically was broken because she didn’t do the necessary updates to keep it working plus the printer they used kept going offline and came back online with a new IP address each time. So I had to rope in another IT person to solve that problem as that was even more outside my wheelhouse. Turns out the location of the printer was on a bad port and electrical outlet so they moved the printer. IT designated the IP address back to the one that was assigned in the system and orders started printing out. But it took a week or more to figure that out on their end. However I knew how to set it up that reports and copies of pick-slips could be emailed for backup purposes and got that all squared away. To find out they didn’t run the update to the shipping computer or configuration to talk back to the warehouse system. Got that all sorted out. Again none of this is in my day-to-day responsibility and we billed the facility for my time.

I advised the plant to get the appropriate training on the warehouse software by the actual company that produced it. While it would be a lot of information they needed someone in-house to deal with it. So they paid the couple thousand and opted for webex of the training as they couldn’t afford to send anyone out to East coast and they would be able to get a recording of the training afterwards. They had 3 people sit in on the training.

Now back to my actual responsibility of the client storefronts. I met with the sales reps who had taken on some of the clients this gal had insisted on being commissioned paid for. While others had no clue about their clients use of the storefronts. Afterwards I rolled out some new processes to streamline things.

Things were fine until corporate decided the Prez was underperforming and demoted him. Then the new guy (who came from our competitor) brought in some flake who at first worked the front desk until he could convince corporate to hire another AR/AP person. That is when shit hit the fan again. This gal tried to run things like they were at said competitor. Changing existing pricing without sales knowledge or approval. Pissing off clients. Again not my wheelhouse but it affected me because they started trying to change pricing on the site, which I managed the updates for. They had me come onsite to train her to run reports and wasted my time. “Oh let me grab coffee before we begin.” 45-mins later still no where to be seen. I made reports of this. Was told to bill for my time regardless. That is when they started complaining about the amount my team was charging for support (which was still cheaper than hiring someone to manage).

Well at some point I got the group controller involved as the local controller left and he was basically living at the facility until they hired a new plant controller. Again none of this would be normal for any of my counterparts. My manager was aware of the shit show happening. Sales team and billing person and even the facilities manager saw all this happening as the office was an open office concept so there was little room for anyone to deny my claims. I tried to be patient but had conversations with the new Prez who would go off on some tangent unrelated to my work and tell me they were removing the trees in the visitor parking lot and frosting the meeting room glass (basically spending money on dumb things). The trees were providing shade to part of the building and most of the lot however they left sap on vehicles and the Prez parked in the visitor lot. 

The nonsense with the pricing that happened had sales reps flocking to leave.

Corporate was closing plants underperforming especially plants that were part of the merger from 2014. The writing was on the wall for this plant if they didn’t get their shit together. In 2014 they purchased the organization I worked for and in 2018 they spun off into 3 organizations. Two of them being debt free and our organization left with the debt.

Flash forward to 2020 covid shutdown. We were told no office visits. Fine I was suppose to be working from home anyways and did when I didn’t have to visit this facility. A couple months later I was laid off along with my manager and a sales support person from my team. But wait… this facility was shuttered as well by the end of 2020 and was to work on clearing out equipment. 

The shit show should have been closed way earlier but the new Prez was trying everything to raise their equity. Hence why AR/AP was raising prices. I know where most of the sales reps ended up going were to competitors because another cost cutting measure during the shutdown was reducing the sales reps commission rate especially if it wasn’t built into the client contract.",6,1751721558.0,talesfromtechsupport,0,0.71,False

1ls9p64,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParentalAlienation/comments/1ls9p64/adult_daughter_of_pa_struggling_after_20_years_of/,Adult daughter of PA struggling after 20 years of complete separation/reunion/reseparation… My story,"It’s incredibly helpful to put a term to this experience- parental alienation syndrome- a relief. After a life time of internalized guilt, mental issues, and the rest…

From what I’ve gathered over time my experience would be considered “severe PA”. There was never any visitation. Though I found out my mother lied about having full custody, it was accepted that that was the case. 

I was a daddy’s girl and my father was my ultimate hero and best friend. He always me things, was my #1 comedian, protector, always spent time with me, creative, generous, he had a huge impact on me. I was his first child and only daughter. I loved my dad more than any thing. 

My mother, narcissistic and bpd. I only have very early memories of them even being able to exist in the same rooms together. After 5 or 6 they slept in separate rooms. My mom and her snobby family hated his guts. 

The divorce started when i was around 10. It took about 6 years. I was so devastated when i heard. I didn’t want to lose my dad. I grew up with Mrs Doubtfire as my personal horror movie. He reminded me of robin williams and I couldn’t stand the pain of even the thought of separation. 

I stayed with my dad in the house i grew up in. My younger brother lived there too and my older half brother he adopted from my mothers previous marriage had already moved out. 

My mother was gone a lot and then moved out at some point, i didn’t know where she was. I didn’t care and felt bitterly towards her. Every interaction was only about the divorce. She would drive up to me while i was walking home from school and make me sign some paperwork, sign a letter, write a letter. She would pry for information about my dad. She would tell me he had people tracking and watching me. 

I was scared. In 7 or 8th grade I had to go see court appointed psych after school and felt horrible. I thought i was being tricked into throwing one of them under the bus, everhthing felt like a horrible test and i’d either fail my mother or father. “Draw a picture of your family on a happy day “… i became angsty and started using my art as rebellion instead.

She told me he could go to jail. I was terrified of this, constant anxiety, he would pick me up from school and i’d be sobbing asking if he was going to jail.

One day when i was 14 she came into the house when he wasn’t there. Sometimes she would pop in and then leave. I was still guarded around her. she found something she thought belonged to him but really was from my boyfriend at the time, this prompted her to launch into a giant speech about a ton of sordid accusations about my father, how horrible he is, perverted, dangerous, abusive. She told me that if i went and stayed with her for a couple weeks it would help the divorce end faster because the judge would see that as a sign of… something. I cant remember what she said exactly but i know 100% i was presented with this concept that me staying with her would somehow speed up the hell i was in.  I really thought it would be just a couple weeks. I wasn’t planning on abandoning my dad. 

Next thing i knew I was being rushed to collect my things and leave my home. I was given a window of a couple hours. That was the last time i was allowed home.

She moved me into the rental she was staying in with me to-be step father (an angel of a man, never bad mouthed my father to me, but unfortunately became victim to my mother as well). I slept on an air mattress next to the dining room table off the kitchen with no door, with only a curtain separating my area from my mother’s room. I had my computer, some clothes, and the rest i had to leave behind. 

This house was only 2 blocks from my dad’s house. I had to leave my dog i raised from a baby there too. I could hear her barking in the yard. 

Court appearances, being forced to write and sign scathing letters against him, being forced to make statements to CPS at the police station.

I had no concept of what this actually was. i knew i was failing in school, i knew every single day I went to my moms house would be hours and hours of screaming, vitriol, intense anxiety about court and lawyers and listening to her panic, and listening to a constant stream of traumatizing hate towards my father. No door, no privacy, no escape. 

If i left the house and turned left instead of right, for example, she would accuse me of sneaking to my dads house and punish me. She was constantly throwing barbs at me like “i bet you wish you would be with him instead, just go” and treat me like shit even though I never even brought him up. There was absolutely zero discussion of visitation, he was treated like a total pariah and the new rules were that if you didn’t consider him Satan you would be deeply punished. 

She was in a constant state of nervous breakdown. She would come up with new missions to spy on him or try to prove to the courts how evil he was and id hear it 24/7. She told me he stole money meant for me and that’s why we had to go on welfare. She said he canceled my health insurance and didn’t care about me etc. 

When i got an email that his mother, my beloved grandmother died, my mother read it and scoffed and said it was a trick and didn’t let me respond or go to the funeral. 

It was a small town, sometimes I’d see him drive by, or walking my dog from afar, and i was trained to pretend he was invisible and to not engage. 

The divorce was finally completed when i was around 16. He showed up to a couple big events at my school; my mom told me they were stalking me and made it seem psychotic. I never had any interaction.

I moved out of town for college.  The separation haunted me but the inertia of time just kept moving. You push it down and it becomes this numb weight. The seething hatred for years… 

But i never hated him. I never truly internalized what my mother said about him. I felt an obligation to support her because i thought she was so much weaker (plethora of health issues, many near death dramatic experiences and hospital visits) and needed my support. She made it very clear that anything less would be a biblical betrayal and I also had a new sense of not wanting to betray my step father (who would have been the most understanding and not seen it that way). 

He emailed me in 2017 and i froze and didn’t respond. In 2020 , he posted a message on my facebook and then i finally reached out. I was terrified. He said “it wasn’t me” about some accusation my mom made and i told him, “i have no idea about anything about that” and instantly moved forward. I went to see him.

Him and his wife welcomed me with open arms back to my childhood home. “This is my daughter, i haven’t seen her in 17 years!” he said to the kind ladies working at his regular coffee shop, so proud to take me there. I stayed in my old room. They didn’t bad mouth my mother once. My father showed me the paperwork that said there was joint custody. 

He said, “ you were 14, so i figured you could make your own decisions”.

This cut me, but I accept it. He had to rationalize the trauma how he needed to also. I tried to not take it personally. 

I asked if he still had my box of childhood drawings. He said it was under the bed and to check, i went to pull out a box excitedly, it was a box with his step daughters name. 

He had dementia. He wasn’t able to move around as easily. He had been through cancer. He was starting to forget things. 

I was consumed with confusion, grief. No one knew i went to see him. I would never tell my mother. I was so sad to have wasted all those years and now I finally found him again and he has dementia. 

Being around him made the entire universe make sense again. he is me. i am him. I am my father’s daughter.

I was supposed to visit again. my step dad died suddenly. I was really angry and traumatized by this. i blamed my mother. 

I couldn’t bring my self to go see my dad and step mom during this time, i didn’t tell them my step dad died. I knew they hated him during the divorce; i couldn’t bare to be around anyone who felt that way about him, even though they might have been kind, I just couldn’t. and again, my mother needed the “most support”, so i felt like if she found out i was seeing my dad while grieving my step dad, she would kill me. 

A year or so passed. i was in several abusive relationships and self destructing, my life and personal issues consumed me, grief and issues with work, functioning, everything.

His emails stopped. I tried at holidays, i tried a few more times. I had to change my number because i was being harassed, and i didn’t send my new one to my step mother, i don’t know why, i didn’t do it intentionally. time just started slipping away again,

But it weighed on me every single day, and then i felt like a piece of shit all over again, not only abandoning my father once but twice. 

The last time i spoke to my step mother was 2 years ago and she told me he was getting worse. 

I had a mental break down last summer thinking about all of this. I feel like i’ve been grieving a death for 20 years but he was alive. And i’ve always felt like i killed him. And now i feel like i killed him twice. All i ever wanted was my dad. So i emailed her and i apologized for losing touch again and told her i loved and missed them and asked how he was,

She never responded,

I started therapy because this made me pretty suicidal which I still am. I understand they don’t owe me any thing and she has a lot on her plate taking care of him and it looks like i abandoned them after they were nothjng but generous to me. I feel like there’s no room for me in either side of my family. My mother doesn’t really like me and has chosen my younger brother over me who still lives with her at 35 as they are completely enmeshed, with a side of munchausen by proxy; i escaped, not without consequence. 

Right now i’m trying to get the courage to email her again and try to make contact. I’m terrified. I don’t know if he still remembers who i am. I don’t know if i’m causing more harm by reaching out, I don’t know if they think i was just being a spy for my mom, or I’m just causing trouble. No one knows i went, let alone her, so it hurts me to still bare the responsibility of her shit when i’m trying to break out of it. 

I’m so consumed with remorse and self hatred that I’m finding it difficult to function, I don’t care about my life or work or any thing becagse it all feels so completely pointless and selfish ehile I should have been focusing on my sick father. 

I never wanted to abandon him in the first place and i didn’t want to do it again, I feel like a monster even though I am intellectually aware now of this PAS phenomenon and that i was technically still a child. I was made to believe i was mature beyond my years and responsible for my decisions, which has left me with a massive guilt i don’t know can be absolved. 

I miss my dad, I need my dad, I love my dad, i always have. I feel so blessed i was able to have the time we did a couple years ago, but I didn’t mean to leave again. I swear i didn’t fucking mean to. 

I never asked for this burden and deeply resent my mother. I don’t consider her to have real love for me because to this day she will flippantly ponder if he’s dead yet and I’ve had to tell her to not speak to me about him. She resents me, all the parts of me that remind her of him, and will never acknowledge any harm she caused, as an eternal victim. 

I don’t know what to do. I cry all of the time. Therapy twice a week. got put in an outpatient program that isn’t helping.

Im 37 and still feel like a hurt little girl who just wants to sit next to her dad and watch the water. Im so sorry, and i’m so sorry for anyone who went through this. 

I don’t have kids, but in another life if I did, I know i would NEVER EVER IN A MILLION YEARS ever dream of putting them through any thing like that. I couldn’t conceive of it for one second. I would rather book my self into 24/7 therapy to deal with my issues than ever put that on a child. 

It’s not love, it’s abuse. And i’ve finally realized the parent i “chose” was actually my abuser and stole my life from me. Everything good that i am and that i’ve accomplished is in spite of her, not because of her. My dad gave me my soul and moral compass. My dad and step dad showed me what real love is. That never dies, and I am blessed, but I am so permanently heart broken. I cant get all the years back and now it’s too late. I dont know how to carry this for the rest of my life. I cant.

Hope everyone has been doing well. I had a lot of helpful insight on this thread a couple of weeks back and what to expect when my boyfriend got out of rehab. 

He called me less than 48 hours after being out and said the only person he wanted to reach out to when he got out was me and that he spent a lot of time reflecting on the guilt and embarrassment he felt during the last month he stayed with me before rehab and wanted to connect when “he had a clearer mind”. He skirted the whole emotional connection and talked about how he put his drinking first before everything and that he cares a lot about me and didn’t want me to think he completely used me but he did know that he could get away with drinking more at my house. He said he wants to be friends and meet for coffee in the next week or 2. 

He seems to be really riding the pink cloud so to speak and I’m just wondering if this is kind of a normal response to that feeling. Where he’s so excited to be sober and stick to his program that I feel as if him trying to keep me as a friend is a loophole to his program or just a way to keep me in his life in a way that’s comforting to him. 

Can anyone please give insight into what that pink cloud feeling is and is he possibly making a decision he thinks is out of clarity but is possibly not? I just want to prepared if he all of a sudden comes running back when the pink cloud ends if that makes sense. I know I can’t predict the future but it helps me a little to know SOME of the possibilities.

On a remarqué qu’on était quelques-uns à galérer à élargir notre cercle d’amis - que ce soit parce qu’on vient d’arriver à Montréal, qu’on est dans une nouvelle phase de vie, ou qu’on en a juste marre de scroller Facebook et Insta pour trouver une activité qui fait du sens.

Trop d’infos, pas assez d’affinités, pas facile de savoir avec qui on va tomber.

Alors on a décidé de créer une app, pensée pour faciliter les rencontres amicales **autour d’activités qui nous ressemblent** (rando, café, jeux, sorties, etc.).

Alors OUI, on sait. Certains sont totalement anti App et on comprend tout à fait que ce mode de fonctionnement ne soit pas pour tout le monde. En revanche il y a du monde pour qui c’est plutôt pratique de passer d’abord par une application pour s’engager socialement.

Pas de dating, pas d’ambiguïté. Juste une façon simple de rencontrer du monde, seul·e, en couple ou entre amis.

L’idée vous parle ? On a mis en ligne une liste d’attente qui vous permettra d’obtenir 6 mois de fonctionnalités premium gratuites et puis surtout d’être nos bêta testeurs préférés ❤️

Il y la possibilité de répondre à un questionnaire pour mieux connaitre vos attentes aussi 😊

We noticed we’re not the only ones struggling to expand our circle of friends - whether it’s because we just moved to Montréal, we’re going through a new phase in life, or we’re simply tired of endlessly scrolling Facebook and Instagram trying to find something that actually makes sense.  
Too much noise, not enough real connection. And it’s hard to know who you’ll end up with.

So we decided to create an app designed to make it easier to build friendships **through activities that feel like** ***us*** (hikes, coffee meetups, game nights, outings, etc.).

And YES, we get it - some people are totally anti-app, and we totally respect that. But for many, starting with an app is actually a simple and convenient way to connect socially.

No dating, no ambiguity. Just an easy way to meet people - whether you’re solo, in a couple, or with friends.

Sounds like something you’d be into? We’ve launched a waitlist where you can get 6 months of free premium features and be one of our favorite beta testers ❤️  
You can also answer a quick questionnaire to help us better understand what you’re looking for 😊

1ls9gyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/americanairlines/comments/1ls9gyw/regional_flying_experience/,Regional Flying Experience,"Flew yesterday on Envoy’s operation of AA3474 on an E175 - about a 3ish hour flight from ILM to DFW.  Sat in business.  Got on board and the flight attendant, first and foremost was hacking up a lung.  Felt genuinely bad for her, but it was apparent we weren’t going to get much out of her.  

She offers drinks to the folks in Row 1.  And no one else.  They ask for coffee and are told “we have no potable water.  So no coffee.”  It wasn’t until later that I also saw there was a sticker on the bathroom up front (assume in the back too) covering the faucet with a bunch of handiwipes in the sink.  

As the trip goes on, she walks around with a basket of snacks and tells everyone “you were supposed to have a meal, but we don’t have any.  Tell customer service after you get off for a food voucher.”  Then she disappeared and I didn’t see her again until we were landing.  When I got off in DFW, I went up to the lounge and I asked one of the customer service reps there about what she mentioned.  She said she had no record of anything and the flight attendant would have to file a report for anything to be in the system.  She did recommend I write into AA and chat about the experience.  🤷‍♂️  Any thoughts on that?  Not sure it’s entirely worth even mentioning to customer service beyond what I did already.  Not sure it’ll change anything - nor do I really expect compensation.  

For the flight, it was genuinely fine.  Not much to say.  A relatively quick trip.  But the plane itself and the staff was lackluster at best.  In all, it could have been much worse, given the delays and cancellations recently.  ",3,1751720805.0,americanairlines,7,0.8,False
1ls9gs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1ls9gs9/slowly_increasing_fat_content_to_high_fat_carni/,"Slowly increasing fat content to high fat carni, but how long until GI distresses pass?","I'm a 40 y/o woman, eating carnivore for approx. 3 months, doing this mainly for mental clarity and weight loss (meaning no specific health issues  to resolve). 

I've been working on increasing my fat in the past week or so. Originally I was eating 2 meals a day,  70/30 or 80/20 ground beef burger patties, scrambled eggs in the grease or fried eggs in the grease, beef steaks, seafood on weekends, occasional pork or chicken (not my faves). So my fat content was ""high"" but also ""not high"". 

My weight loss stalled for almost a full month, and I really really really don't want to start tracking macros again so I started looking into Dr Elizabeth Bright and down the rabbit-hole on YouTube about fat for women's health. I increased my fat - I now eat approximately 50g of butter a day in addition to more intentionally consuming more of the fat from the pan with my meals and switching to chuck-eye cuts or similar. I also now have shifted to a 6pm OMAD, other than the butter I have in my coffee in the mornings.

It worked fantastic and things are going great now other than the GI issues - I'm wondering how long the adjustment period is for my GI tract to get with the program and calm down. The first two days I had crazy diarrhea. It's now a little better, instead of sprinting to the bathroom I power-walk, but it's definitely not normal.

I also suspect my liver is not producing bile fast enough to be able to digest the amount of fat I'm consuming, because I have pain in the middle of the night that wakes me up and keeps me up where I feel physically hot and uncomfortably full, in fact I'm still overly full 15hrs later after eating what I would consider a normal, reasonably sized dinner.

Do these improve over time? I'd love to hear other people's high fat adventures and misadventures.",2,1751720791.0,carnivorediet,9,0.67,False
1ls9gaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1ls9gaz/aropress_issues/,Aropress issues,"I've recently got a grinder and have just gotten onto my second bag of beans. 

I was able to dile in my grinder and used hofferman's airopress recipe with some fairly dark specialty coffee (bag 1). 


But I've since gone to a lighter Grind specialty coffee (bag 2) and am haveing issues.

At 3 muinits of brew time including pressing, it's waaayyy over extracted so I increced the Grind size. Still over extracted but less so. Then reduced the time to 2 muinits and went for an in-between Grind size wich is better.

I'm still missing the sweetness from the beans. 

I first had the beans in a coffee shop as an espresso so I'm trying to get close to that.

Is it that I'm using an aropress so it will taste different or is it my brewing recipe?

My girlfriend's birthday is coming up, and she's a slight coffee addict. Up until now, we only had the budget for instant coffee ( she usually gets Nescafé Select and adds sugar & vanilla soy milk along with some caramel syrup, so she likes it on the sweeter side). 

I'd like to surprise her with a coffee machine, but I'm unsure what to get her. I've been thinking about a machine with nespresso or dolce gusto coffee-cups, but I'm slightly worried that the taste, amount of coffee it makes (our cups are quite big) & price of the coffee-cups would not be ideal. Does anyone have experience with this?

 I've also looked at the Philips Baristina which looks good, but I've read some reviews that it breaks fairly easily after a couple months of usage, so I'm not sure if this is the best choice.

 I could also consider a pricier automatic machine, but I've no clue what to look for at that point. Could anyone give me some advice please? I've got a budget of around 300-400 euro.

**Everyone else today:**

* Recovering from hangovers and too much food
* Posting Instagram highlights from yesterday's parties
* Complaining about having to go back to work Monday
* Dealing with sunburns and cleanup

**Caregivers today:**

* Same schedule as yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that
* Maybe dealing with extra confusion from yesterday's noise and disruption
* Possibly managing increased anxiety in our loved ones
* Back to the regular routine while everyone else talks about their ""amazing weekend""

**The weird part:** We're simultaneously jealous of their ""normal"" problems and grateful we didn't have to deal with crowds, traffic, and overstimulation.

**What today actually teaches us:**

* Consistency can be a gift (even when it doesn't feel like it)
* Our loved ones depend on us to be their anchor when the world gets chaotic
* We're really good at finding joy in small moments because we have to be
* ""Normal"" is relative, and ours is just different

**Today's gentle reminder:** Just because our celebration looked different doesn't mean it was less meaningful. Just because our schedule didn't change doesn't mean we didn't honor the holiday.

**Saturday self-care suggestions:**

* Extra coffee (you've earned it)
* Comfortable clothes all day
* Lower expectations for productivity
* Maybe save some leftover celebration food for today
* Remember that stability and love are their own kind of patriotic service

1ls986o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1ls986o/investigate_how_the_nuwave_pic_gold_induction/,Investigate How the Nuwave PIC Gold Induction Cooktop Transforms Your Cooking,"Cooking has taken on a whole new dimension ever since I started testing out the Nuwave PIC Gold Induction Cooktop. My experience with it hasn’t just been about whipping up meals but also enjoying precision and control over the cooking process. The Nuwave PIC Gold, with its sleek design paired with efficient functionality, feels like a game-changer for both seasoned chefs and beginners like me trying to perfect a new dish.

**Design and Durability**  
The compact and portable design of this induction cooktop immediately grabbed my attention. The golden tone adds a hint of luxury while the ceramic glass surface looks sleek and modern in my kitchen. Despite its light 6.45-pound weight, it feels sturdy and reliable. I’ve had cooktops before that seemed fragile, but the shatter-proof ceramic glass on this one gives me a sense of assurance. It feels good knowing that it can handle intense heat without worry. Plus, the 13.5” x 12.25” size makes it easy to move around or store when not in use.

**Temperature Precision and Adjustability**  
What makes this induction cooktop stand out more than anything else is its precise and responsive temperature control. With 51 pre-programmed temperatures ranging from 100°F to 575°F, I’ve been able to easily switch from keeping my soup warm to searing steaks to perfection. Adjusting the temperature is quick and intuitive, thanks to the push-button digital controls. I admit I got a bit obsessed with fine-tuning my cooking, experimenting with 10°F increments to find the perfect balance for different recipes. For someone who loves versatility in the kitchen, this is definitely a standout feature.

**Check [Nuwave PIC Gold price on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0c7hl4ghp/)**  

**Ease of Use and User-Friendly Features**  
As someone who sometimes flusters under time pressure, I appreciate the clean and intuitive interface this cooktop offers. I didn't have to spend hours diving into a manual; the controls are incredibly easy to navigate. Adding or reducing cooking time mid-session feels seamless, which has saved a few meals from near disaster in my case. Plus, the cooktop automatically shuts off when the timer ends or when no cookware is detected. This has been a lifesaver on those forgetful mornings when my coffee takes all my attention.

**Safety Features**  
Safety-wise, I cannot overstate the relief I feel using an induction cooktop versus traditional stovetops with exposed coils or flames. The absence of open flames makes cooking feel a lot safer, especially with young kids running around. Unlike other induction cooktops I’ve tried, where the surface seemed overly sensitive to movements, the Nuwave PIC Gold only heats cookware and remains cool to the touch. The built-in shutoff feature gives additional peace of mind when multitasking in a busy kitchen. 

**Performance Upsides**  
- The shatter-proof ceramic glass surface makes it exceptionally sturdy and durable.  
- 51 precise temperature settings allow for complete control over your cooking.  
- Auto shutoff and cookware detection features contribute significantly to safety.  
- Compact and portable design fits perfectly in small kitchens or for outdoor use.

**Negatives I Encountered**  
Despite its impressive performance, no product is without its flaws.  
- The fan can be a bit noisier than I’m used to with similar products. It’s not deafening, but you’ll notice it during extended cooking sessions.  
- The controls, while generally easy to use, sometimes require a firmer press than expected.  
- If you’re unfamiliar with induction cookware, you may need to ensure your pots and pans are compatible, as traditional ones won't work.

**Competing Products**  
It’s impossible to ignore the competition in the induction cooktop market, and I’ve tried a few others like the Duxtop P961 and the Cuisinart ICT-60. While these also have notable features, the Nuwave induction cooktop edges ahead in temperature precision and safety features. For example, the Duxtop gets kudos for its timer controls but lacks the high-end shatter-proof surface. Cuisinart, on the other hand, might have a slightly more modern appearance but doesn’t offer as wide a range of temperature settings. 

Where Nuwave excels is balancing safety and versatility. However, brands like Duxtop remain appealing for budget buyers who may not need the same degree of control.

**Price Performance**  
Considering value, the cooktop’s features and materials align with what you’d expect at this quality level. Paying for precision, safety, and convenience in one package feels justified. It might be slightly on the premium side for some casual users, but the long-term benefits outweigh the initial upfront cost. Unlike cheaper alternatives, this isn’t something you’ll replace after a year, and that makes it a smart buy for dedicated home chefs or small households alike.

She was never going to use it and gave it to me because I was interested in coffee and espresso. At some point I got a cheap delonghi espresso machine and used that manual grinder (after a ton of troubleshooting getting the right grind). It was never worth the toil of a manual grind to get bad espresso so I ended up not using the machine much and getting rid of it. That was about 5 years ago and today I spent 3 hours making about 20 grinds of 15 grams in order to get an extraction on the flair. I would change the grinder one click and it would either be too fine or too coarse. In order to grind my coffee it was about 75 cranks and very difficult at times. Once I gave up because there was no way I was going to get the right grind I decide to look up the “good quality” grinder I assumed I had. I have no idea where it came from but I believed it to be a $100+ burr grinder. It is in fact the “hario” skerton plus coffee grinder not meant for espresso whatsoever. Not a single one of the 20+ attempts cranking the grinder mattered whatsoever and it was a complete waste of time. I immediately ordered the timemore c3 pro so I can finally have a real espresso grinder.

1ls90wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1ls90wi/the_covert_narcissist_who_also_has_anxiety/,The Covert Narcissist who also has anxiety,"I live with my 86 year old widowed elderly mother who is a covert narcissist and she also has anxiety. I was reading an article today about this because something about this felt counter intuitive i.e. how could someone who is hyper focused on herself and her own needs also feel anxious. 

These are the traits and triggers of covert narcissists based on this article [https://www.medenshealth.com/blog/what-is-covert-narcissism](https://www.medenshealth.com/blog/what-is-covert-narcissism) 

And the part that says they genuinely suffer from depression and anxiety and that they use their struggles to seek attention. Their struggles are what they use to make themselves important and the priority in any decision or conversation. 

My mother does have genuine health issues. They aren't particularly unique. She has a heart condition and some other stuff like arthritis and high blood pressure but that's a huge segment of elderly people. Despite having these issues she outlived my father and has outlived all of her siblings. So her treatments have been working and she will, of course, take credit for always strongly advocating for her health which we all should do. 

But her approach goes above and beyond advocacy to everything about her and herself. She has dragged me to the ER about 6 times in the past three months because she has a pain or she feels dizzy or she feels out of breath. And each time she gets tests and sees her cardiologist who has basically written to me to say that what she has is: anxiety. That nothing in her tests suggest a change beyond what is to be expected from someone who has lived literally her entire life with a heart condition caused by a heart defect she acquired as a child. A doctor literally said to my mother straight out last week that her heart is weaker because she's 86 and that happens to all of us as we age and my mother just will not accept that. 

Now she is moping around the house saying she ""may as well be dead but nothing will kill me"" and then the next minute will be yelling at me to urge her doctors to see her YET AGAIN. She expects to be admitted to a hospital where they will take several days to determine the exact root cause of her problems (aging?) and a proper regiment of drugs to fix them. And why? Because in her words ""It's for you, I don't want you coming home one day to find me dead. It would be horrible for you."" 

So in that vein lately she will freak out if I leave the house. If she is left alone for anything more than the hour it might take me to buy groceries, she will call me and ask me what happened, why am I not home because she can't be left alone. A friend called me to ask me if I wanted to go out for a coffee or ice cream yesterday and my mother started shaming me and blaming me about how she is so unwell. And then my friend decided to visit me instead and bring ice cream and my mother sat there with us talking and joking and laughing for 3 hours until midnight. Didn't look that sick to me. She just wanted to hijack my free time. 

Living with a covert narcissist is so challenging because to the world they are the ""sick old lady who needs care""... if they only knew the truth!

It spooked the crap out of me.  I checked the app and didn’t have any wheelslip or footpad notifications, so I looped back around to see if I ran over anything.

The only thing I could find was a clump of freshly cut grass.  The kind that still has the roots attached, and that was it, but it was close to the sidewalk, not in the path my board had taken.

Is it possible that during the carve I ran over the clump of grass, and kind of drifted for a second, then the clump got shot out by the tire towards the sidewalk?

I’ve had wheelslip nosedives before, and have experienced drifting over sandy and dirt covered areas, but this felt different.  

Also, I didn’t hear the motor accelerating the way it typically does during a wheelslip scenario, and when I checked the ride recording there wasn’t a spike in speed, which is also common with wheelslip scenarios.

Am I over thinking it? I’ve logged a little over 4000 miles across three different boards, it’s been a while since something has spooked me like this.

I was honestly devastated and still am. I was really sad because the relationship ended on a bad note, but I decide to reach out to him after 3 months of no contact. I told him I wanted to speak to him about the breakup etc… He agreed for us to go drink a coffee, so we met up today. When we broke up he kind of gave me hope because he said “ideally I would want for us to get better and be together”. I’ve kind of held on to this hope and needed clarification. He just told me that he doesn’t want to be with me and won’t want something in the future. So he’s totally moved on and knowing him, he’s the kind of guy that never looks back at the past, especially for exes. It was a relief to hear him say that but also heartbreaking. I still love him deeply and I have to just stop hoping he’ll come back. I said I couldn’t be friends w him for now because I still have feelings, but maybe in the future. It felt so good to talk to him because we get along so well. Now I just want to keep texting him and I told him we didn’t need to be no contact anymore. Maybe that was a mistake ? Do I tell him that we should go no contact until im sure I have no feelings ? I feel like I’m in a nightmare. It’s so unfair that the person I love the most just doesn’t want me anymore. 
I have so much empathy for anyone going through a breakup bc it’s honestly the worst thing ever. I don’t know how to grieve. I really thought he was going to be the father of my children and the man I’d marry. ",8,1751719292.0,BreakUps,7,0.9,False

1ls8ys7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ls8ys7,How much time passes during Young hearts?,"Dear Young Hearts fan, If you are reading this, grab a nice cup of coffee (or just a waffle), sit back and relax, you have a long read ahead of you.

Ok, so I've been thinking of this for a few days. Do we know how much time passes in the film? At what time of the year did Alex move to the new house?

Let's see...

At the beginning of the film, we see Elias and Lucas talking in the school corridor. It sounds like they had been on holiday until that day. But which holidays? It's the first days of school after the summer? I think it could be.

It sounds strange because between some scenes of the movie we can see that it is possible that days or even weeks go by if we look at small details. 

An example: when Elias talks to Valerie on IG, she talks about letting him cheat on the exam and that she won't sit next to Alex as she usually does. So, it must have been a while since the scene where Alex arrives at school for the first time. Why would they have an exam right after the vacations? Valerie sits with Alex because she has already known him for several days, in the first scene we can see that Alex sits in another place at the back of the class. So it has been several weeks? months?

On the other hand, the relationship between Alex and Elias seems to emerge very quickly but if we pay attention to the details it seems that many weeks should have passed until we see the scene in which both bathe in the river.

Another detail: in the scene where Alex arrives to class, we can see that Elias is drawing on the last pages of the book (something I used to do too, the last pages of the books are almost never used) but if we look at Valerie's book she is paying attention to the lesson and is in the first pages of the book. This could confirm that we are at the beginning of the course. It would also make sense because it is strange that Alex moves almost at the end of the course, it is rare that he changes schools only for the last month of the course. 

It would make sense that between the scene with the pigs on the farm and the scene where they both go to the castle a few days or weeks would have passed, they both seem closer and closer friends and it would fit with what Anthony said about the movie originally being 3 hours long. My theory is that the deleted scenes are alternate days where we see the evolution of the relationship between Alex and Elias in and out of school before the first kiss. It seems that in between the two have met, the bullies already know them and that's why they yell at them, they start going home together from school.

As someone said before, there is also at least one scene missing where we see Elias interact with Alex's sister. At the festival she hugs him as if they had spent more than one afternoon together.

From another point of view, if we look at the weather in the movie. It could be that Alex moves in early April when the weather starts to get a little warmer. That's why we see Alex sometimes in long pants and sometimes in shorts. It would make sense that the relationship will evolve in those months (April to June) and that it will end with the harvest festival which is in August, instead of happening in a couple of weeks as it might seem at first. So the final scene of the movie would be the beginning of summer, which makes sense in any case. 

Although it would not be exact since the summer vacations begin on July 1 and the harvest festival does not take place until August. April would make sense if they came back from Easter vacation.

So what do you guys think? Alex moves at the beginning of the course as the first clues suggest? In April as the weather suggests? Or do you have another theory?",12,1751719199.0,younghearts,3,0.93,False

I’ve been trying to manifest my ex back, more or less consistently, for the past 3 months since our breakup.

Yesterday, I was in a good mood, and for the past two days I’d been watching videos of vintage engagement rings with big diamonds because I find them stunning. I started imagining one of those rings on my finger , one that my ex would give me.

Later in the day, I went to my grandmother’s for coffee, and I had another wave of excitement while picturing myself wearing a vintage ring from my ex.

Two hours later, she started talking about what she would leave each of her grandchildren when she passed away (we are five in total), and for me, she pulled out a vintage ring, the only one she wears , and told me she had decided this ring would be for me. She even let me try it on, and I put it on the finger meant for an engagement ring.

What’s crazy is that two days earlier, I had looked at that exact ring on her hand and thought to myself: I love her ring.

Then, later that same day, I randomly saw a street sign with my ex’s name on it , even though I basically never see that name anywhere.

Also, that same morning, I had tried the O method in the shower (since water is supposed to be a conductor), and I visualized my ex telling me that he missed me and wanted to get back together.

Quit 6 Years of Heavy Coffee Use — 18 Days In and Still Struggling Badly  especially with sleep. 


I’ve been drinking coffee daily for the past 6 years, and not just a cup or two — I used to mix 4 teaspoons of instant coffee directly into water and drink that in the morning, every single day. No milk, no sugar, just strong caffeine to kickstart my brain.

I finally quit on June 18, so today is Day 18 caffeine-free.

I haven’t touched a drop of coffee or tea since. But honestly, it’s still really tough.

Here’s what I’m dealing with:

Low motivation

Low energy

Kind of sad and depressed

Still having intense brain fog

Waking up at night — around 11:15 PM and again at 3–4 AM, and I can’t fall back asleep

I go to sleep at 9:40 PM consistently, but I don’t feel rested


I didn’t expect the recovery to take this long. I thought things would improve after 7–10 days, but I still feel stuck. No cravings, just a very foggy and flat brain. I’m trying to eat well and stay consistent, but some days are rough.

Has anyone else gone through this after long-term, high-dose caffeine use?

When I was in my early twenties I had met two brothers who ended up becoming my best friends, we’ll call them Carson and Daniel. Daniel is a year older than me and Carson is a year younger. When we first became friends Carson and I became closer than Daniel and I so much that we hung out Every. Single. Day. For about 10 months straight. We ended up dating and for the first time ever I actually felt love in a relationship. We were best friends, we had just about everything in common, and we did everything together. We were together for 3 1/2 years but our relationship got rocky due to both of us being young and dumb. During our relationship I still remained extremely close to Daniel and around the time Carson and I’s relationship ended so did Daniel’s with his long term relationship as well. Daniel and I started hanging out more often just to help each other out of our breakup funks and it ended up becoming a close to every day thing even if it was just grabbing a cup of coffee or beer after work just to chat about our days. 
About a year into us hanging out relatively every day and us becoming extremely close friends, I ended up losing my actual best friend and it was the hardest loss I had ever experienced. Daniel was there for me through it all, even came to the funeral with me even though it was hours away. It was around that time that I started catching feelings for him and turns out those feelings were reciprocated. Daniel and I started dated about a month later and we were together for 3 years. During our relationship something always just felt off, I didn’t feel love like I had with Carson and I didn’t feel loved like that either, but I was still happy and still did have love for Daniel. I always convinced myself it was in my head and I truly believed I was suppose to end up with Daniel and those feelings were just be self sabotaging. 
Towards the end of our three years we ended up getting pregnant and my child is the most amazing thing to ever happen to me! But his father not so much. In our third year Daniel ended up becoming quite the alcoholic, we fought a lot, and things just felt different. During my pregnancy I realized I was no longer in love with him and I didn’t want to be with him forever especially with how he had become in the last year. 
Then our child came and I couldn’t have been happier, but as he grew I grew and I had done a lot of soul searching. During that time it dawned on me that I don’t think I was ever actually in love with Daniel. I think I was in love with the similarities he had with Carson. I also realized that I purposely avoided Carson during Daniel and I’s relationship and I thought at the time it was to avoid awkwardness and guilt but I now realize it was to avoid my feelings I continue to have for him. The more I think about it the more I realize I never did fall out of love with him and I still to this day love him. I have never felt the way I do for him about anyone else and it honestly breaks my heart and makes me slightly sick just thinking about it. 
But I wouldn’t trade my son in for the world so I’m glad I ended up with Daniel when I did because if not I wouldn’t have our son. And there’s also nothing I can do about Carson now because he met a girl and they seem happy and I am also the mother to his nephew so there’s really no going back. But I just can’t get over how much I love him. I guess I just needed to release that from my chest. ",2,1751718659.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,0.75,False

We ended up at his place. And when I say “place,” I mean a studio apartment with one chair, no sheets, and a suspiciously sticky floor. Red flags? Sure. But my vodka brain said, “Adventure!”

We did the deed. Twice. It was messy, fast, and passionate, and I felt like a damn goddess. I left around 3 a.m., barefoot, holding my heels, with the glow of poor decisions on my face. I didn’t even get his last name.

Three days later… my vagina started plotting against me.

I woke up with this awful burning sensation. I thought maybe it was a UTI, but then I saw *blisters.* Like actual, what-the-hell-is-this horror movie bumps. I panicked. Texted my group chat. My best friend replied: *“Girl. Herpes.”*

I drove to urgent care in my sweats, crying into my iced coffee. The nurse took one look and said, “Yeah… looks like HSV-2.” I wanted the Earth to swallow me whole.

The worst part? I had to tell the guy I *had* been casually seeing—someone I actually liked. That conversation went like:

“Hey, uh… I have herpes now. No big deal, just thought you should know I’m a biohazard.”

He was surprisingly cool about it. Still freaked, but cool.

Anyway, I haven’t seen the rooftop guy since. Never got his last name. Never saw him on social media. It’s like he disappeared into the night after dropping off an unwanted party favor.

Moral of the story? Always wrap it up. And if his apartment has no bedsheets, maybe keep your pants on.",1,1751718452.0,AskSTD,0,1.0,False

More specifically the Gaggia Espresso Style/Deluxe (don’t have a big budget) 

For convenience I would be using preground espresso grind coffee (from local coffee roaster) weekly, if I go for the espresso machine.

My question is, would the reduction in quality/taste from buying preground beans outweigh the benefits of using an espresso machine and having more control/better pour to produce a better coffee? Or should I stick to looking at replacing with a bean to cup and have the benefits of the fresher grind?

Thanks! 

Edit: currently at the start of my home coffee journey, so if I go the espresso machine route I would look to get a grinder & upgrade espresso machine 6m-1year down the line. ",1,1751718263.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

GG is $10,700 
SS is $7,200

I’m interested in how GF compares to the Poly. I stayed there last year in a suite and wasn’t that impressed. It was very crowded and I couldn’t ever find a chair at the pool. Wasn’t impressed with the restaurants and didn’t find it to be a luxury hotel (no bottled water, no robes, didn’t even put a trash bag in the trash can for you, no coffee station in the lobby of the tower, I could go on….)

I understand the downside of SS are the buses. Is it possible to use the Minnie service to make this better?

I’m not concerned about walking. We walked to/from the Poly to MK last year and found it to be NBD. One reason to stay at GF is so we can walk. 

My concern about the GF is that it will be too similar to Poly and I’m paying $10,700 - that’s a lot. We will also be buying premier passes.

1ls8ist,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1ls8ist/does_a_keurig_make_cold_coffee/,Does a Keurig make cold coffee?,"As a coffee lover, I've always been curious about different brewing methods, especially when it comes to cold coffee. Recently, I've been wondering if my trusty Keurig can make cold coffee. After doing some research and experimenting, I'm here to share what I've learned.

First off, let's address the main question: Does a Keurig make cold coffee? The short answer is yes, but with some caveats.

Keurig machines are primarily designed for hot coffee, but there are ways to use them for cold brews. The easiest method is to brew a regular cup of hot coffee using your Keurig and then pour it over ice. This gives you an iced coffee, but it's not quite the same as a true cold brew.

If you want a more authentic cold coffee experience, there are K-Cups specifically made for iced coffee. These are designed to brew a stronger, more concentrated coffee that won't get watered down when poured over ice. Some popular brands even offer their own iced coffee K-Cups.

However, it's important to note that this method still involves brewing hot coffee and then cooling it down. True cold brew coffee is made by steeping grounds in cold water for several hours, which gives it a smoother, less acidic taste.

While Keurig machines can make a decent iced coffee, they're not ideal for making large batches of cold brew. If you're a cold coffee enthusiast like me, you might want to consider investing in a dedicated iced coffee maker. These are designed specifically for cold brewing and can make larger quantities at once.

I recently discovered a great selection of iced coffee makers at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They have options for every budget and preference, from simple cold brew pitchers to more advanced systems.

One thing I've learned is that having the right equipment can make a big difference in your coffee experience. While my Keurig is great for quick, hot cups of coffee, having a separate iced coffee maker has really upped my cold brew game.

If you're interested in exploring different iced coffee options, I'd highly recommend checking out the selection at https://athometouch.com/Iced-Coffee-Makers. They have some really cool gadgets that can take your cold coffee to the next level.

In conclusion, while a Keurig can make a decent iced coffee in a pinch, it's not the best option for true cold brew enthusiasts. If you're serious about your cold coffee, investing in a dedicated iced coffee maker might be worth considering. It's opened up a whole new world of coffee possibilities for me, and I think you might enjoy it too.

Remember, good coffee is all about finding what works best for you. Whether that's a quick iced coffee from your Keurig or a smooth cold brew from a specialized maker, the most important thing is that you enjoy it. Happy brewing!",1,1751717713.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
